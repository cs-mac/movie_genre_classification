2
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,545
Marnie?

3
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,131
I know we agreed
to take some time off.

4
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,175
And I think that was a great idea.

5
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,343
My God.

6
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:57,223
It gave us both a chance
to experiment, if you will,

7
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,811
and meet all sorts of new
and interesting, different people.

8
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,983
You did quite a bit more
experimenting than I did.

9
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,281
A lot more experimenting.
You are like a scientist!

10
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:19,036
With beakers and... But, obviously,
I'm cool with that. Like...

11
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:23,166
'Cause the thing is,
I think we're stronger as a result.

12
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,712
But here's the thing, Marnie,
it's been two years.

13
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,214
And that's a lot of time off.

14
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,510
And I'm ready for some time on.

15
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,014
I miss you.

16
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,559
I miss us.

17
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,813
I got something for you.

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,817
What do you think?

19
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,861
Oh, man!

20
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,534
It's depressing.
I mean, it's really depressing.

21
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,788
It's horrible to watch you like this.

22
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,207
I think this is really pretty.
How's it work?

23
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,542
What the hell is that?

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,546
I got it for Valentine's Day,
right before she broke up with me.

25
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,216
Look, Stainer, I know
you don't like her very much.

26
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,344
No. No. I hate her. In fact,
the day that you broke up with her,

27
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,430
I marked that down in my calendar
as a day of rejoicement.

28
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,933
I'm gonna celebrate it
with a cake with her face on it.

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,228
But instead of eating it, we smash it.
OK? You can do a lot better.

30
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,605
- You deserve a lot better, Kirk.
- Thank you,

31
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,900
but I've seen what's out there
and I don't think it gets any better.

32
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,736
When have you been out there?
When have you left the apartment?

33
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,572
I went out on four different dates.

34
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,575
With three girls and that guy.

35
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,578
I don't know what his
intentions were, but it's fine.

36
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,081
We had a great conversation.
He was just lookin' for a friend.

37
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,916
- Know what your problem is?
- What?

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,668
- You're a moodle.
- A "moodle"?

39
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,420
A man poodle. Girls,
they want to take you out on a walk.

40
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,383
They want to feed you, they want to
cuddle you. But, make no mistake,

41
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,219
no girl wants to do the moodle.

42
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,929
- No one'd ever fuck a moodle.
- No.

43
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,389
- He's right.
- I'm telling you,

44
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,183
if you want to get Marnie back,
she has got to believe

45
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,394
that from the second
she broke up with you,

46
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,021
your life has been
a non-stop snatch parade.

47
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,360
Or you could just be who you are.
Why can't that be good enough?

48
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,071
Why don't you put your
fucking balls in here, dude?

49
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,785
Yeah!

50
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:35,381
- "Snatch parade. " Really, Kirk?
- Yeah, it's been pretty awesome.

51
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:41,304
I've been raw-doggin' some randoms.
Usually careful. Mostly careful, though.

52
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,014
Always using protection.

53
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,185
Double-baggin' it sometimes
just to make sure there's

54
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,564
no seepage because...

55
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,904
...gonorrhea, herpes and stuff.
I don't want that.

56
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:03,409
Wow. I am really happy that
you are doing so well with the ladies.

57
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,911
But, truthfully, Marnie.

58
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,832
I reallyjust want to give all that up
and get back together with you.

59
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,962
Kirk? You know I'm with Ron now.

60
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,258
Raw-doggin' some randoms?

61
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,219
Wow, Kirky, sounds like you got
some good stuff goin' on.

62
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,222
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Ron.

63
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,310
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

64
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,439
Oh, you want to talk? No problem.

65
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,983
- I'll just be in the other room.
- Thanks, buddy.

66
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,445
Ah, sorry. One more thing.
Is there any salsa?

67
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,868
You know what? I'll find it myself.
Good luck there, pirate.

68
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:53,709
- Are you kidding me, Marnie? That guy?
- That guy is an entrepreneur.

69
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,546
- Well, Ron owns a Pizza Hut.
- That's a business.

70
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,342
It's not even a real Pizza Hut!
It's a Pizza Hut Express!

71
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,220
Working airport security
with your dipshit friends

72
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,472
isn't getting you closer
to being a pilot.

73
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,516
I... I got you somethin'.

74
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:13,688
Like, remember that time I made you
the mix tape of all the Kate Bush songs

75
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,732
I thought applied to our relationship?
This is cooler.

76
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,321
Happy Valentine's Day
from two years ago.

77
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,490
Hi, honey. Everything OK?

78
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,202
- Yeah.
- Oh, God, what is that?

79
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,414
I think it's an ashtray?

80
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,750
- No, it's for your earrings.
- Or that.

81
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,920
Kirk, please, don't cause a scene.
Everyone's over.

82
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,756
Jesus, Mom,
a little privacy here, please?

83
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,384
- It's OK, Mrs. Kettner.
- OK.

84
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,097
Kirk. You know that I don't
get along with my own parents,

85
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,643
and you've been really great about
your family practically adopting me

86
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,311
since we broke up.

87
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,106
- I love you.
- Marnie, I love you, too.

88
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,358
Just... OK... Let me finish.

89
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,823
I love you like I love... TV.

90
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,536
- I love you like I love pizza.
- Superfly Snuka!

91
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,288
- No, Dylan!
- You still got it!

92
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,081
- Give it to him!
- What's up, little bro?

93
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,917
- Fuck you!
- Dylan! Leave your brother alone.

94
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,295
- Snap him like a wishbone.
- Sore spot? Just let it happen.

95
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,964
- Yeah! You ain't got shit, you pussy!
- I hate you!

96
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,841
Mom! Kirk said he hated me!

97
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,303
OK, let's move out! Movie night!
I do not want to miss the previews.

98
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,306
- Here. I got the brews. Let's go!
- Comin' with us, pirate?

99
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,309
- No, thanks.
- It's Chris Tucker, dude.

100
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,061
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

101
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,730
Do you see the words
comin' outta my mouth?!

102
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,525
Chris Tucker, right?
Mom! I did the Chris Tucker for him.

103
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,986
- That's nice.
- I'm just gonna leave this here.

104
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,821
He's the black guy from Rush Hour.

105
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,114
- Let's go, go, go!
- OK.

106
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,700
- Mom... Yeah.
- You know, it's engraved on...

107
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,213
Boarding passes and IDs
where I can see them, please!

108
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,714
Let's go!

109
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,882
- Hey.
- Hey.

110
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,384
Boarding passes and IDs where I...

111
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,053
Oh, well, well, well.
Thanks for comin' in, Kettner.

112
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,555
Sorry I'm late, Fuller.

113
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,308
- Yeah? You'd better have a good excuse.
- No.

114
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,853
You wanna take a second?
Make somethin' up?

115
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,730
- Nope.
- Interesting.

116
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,442
Oh, look at this.

117
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,946
Yes, yes.

118
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,492
Yeah, that's so good.
That's great. That's perfect.

119
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,745
Listen, Mr. Friedman,
their quote is lower than ours.

120
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,083
So if fake flowers and cheap champagne
is how you want to woo your clients,

121
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,295
then feel free to blow us out.
I'm sure the event'll be fine.

122
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,922
Thank you, Mr. Friedman. Tomorrow.

123
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,175
Have a nice flight.

124
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,431
Boarding passes and IDs
where I can see... Hi!

125
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,433
- Hi.
- Hay-lo.

126
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,018
Hi-lo. Hello!

127
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,939
New York, huh?
Yeah. The Big... City.

128
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,232
Big Apple.

129
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:51,280
Big Apple City. I get up there a lot,
'cause I actually, I gig up there.

130
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,698
I play in a band.

131
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,159
- I'm the lead in a band.
- Hey, Stainer.

132
00:08:55,327 --> 00:09:01,290
Did you get the numbers with...
For the new procedures regarding planes?

133
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,708
This is Randy.

134
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,462
- What's up?
- Hi.

135
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,298
- Well, everything checks out.
- Thank you.

136
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,094
- Do you need a hand?
- No.

137
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,805
Smooth. Go put this back in the trash.

138
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,099
- It's a memo.
- Put it back in the trash!

139
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:24,480
- Boarding passes and IDs, please!
- Next! Oh, ma'am!

140
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,982
- Your shoes.
- Oh, sorry.

141
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,863
OK, let's go ahead and strip off
that belt too, while we're at it, huh?

142
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,494
You have any piercings
you want me to know about?

143
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,954
Anything at all?

144
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,331
All right,
I'm really late for my flight.

145
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,668
Why don't you step on through,
we'll see if you set off the machine.

146
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,253
Thank you.

147
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,005
No, no, no. Not so fast.

148
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,092
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step over to the wanding area.

149
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,470
- Fuller, why?
- Well, you never know. I mean...

150
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,014
You just waved the wand
over your tie clip!

151
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,558
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did.

152
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,689
Well, I am keeping an eye on you.

153
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,944
Wow. They let guys like that work here?

154
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,445
Yep!

155
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,616
Yes, they, they,
they let that guy be my boss.

156
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,202
Thank you for pissing off
your boss for me.

157
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,497
Oh, yeah, please, anytime.

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,254
- Molly! Your boarding pass.
- Oh, thanks... Kirk.

159
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,549
Kirk.

160
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,262
Flight six-three to JFK, you're
cleared for taxiing on runway two-niner.

161
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,265
Cabin crew, lock doors and cross-check.

162
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,559
Dude! Cut it a little closer,
why don't you?

163
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,978
I think I lost my iPhone.
I left it in security.

164
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,355
Well, here, calm down. I'll call it.

165
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,203
- Hello?
- Who's this?

166
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,914
I don't know. Might be the guy
with the new iPhone. Who's this?

167
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,876
I don't know. Might be your
worst fucking nightmare, you...

168
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,003
- Patty! Stop it!
- Sorry.

169
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,424
Hello? Thank God you have my phone.
My name is Molly McCleish.

170
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,510
I remember you well. What gate
are you at? I'll run it over.

171
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,221
Know what? We're actually
pushing back right now.

172
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,641
Excuse me. You're not
supposed to be on your phone.

173
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,020
- It's bad for the plane.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Are you a plane doctor?

174
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,397
No? So shut the fuck up.

175
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:34,276
Tell you what, I'll just leave it at
Lost and Found for you. How 'bout that?

176
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,029
Would you hold on to it for me?
I'm coming back tomorrow.

177
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,115
I'm an event planner. I'm having
this party at the Warhol Museum.

178
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,909
- We could meet there.
- Yes, of course.

179
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,744
I know where that is. It's actually

180
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,621
- on my way home from work.
- Sir?

181
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,916
- She's talking on her phone.
- Dude! Go shit in your hand.

182
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,585
I have to go.

183
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,462
Tonight's the night, Kirky.

184
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,589
No. I...
Devon, tonight is just a night

185
00:11:55,757 --> 00:12:00,469
where I return some lost property
to a fellow human being.

186
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,763
Come on, man, you gotta be positive.

187
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,850
It's exciting! I mean,
the night's full of possibilities.

188
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,479
- I can almost smell 'em.
- Oh, man.

189
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,025
- You know what this reminds me of?
- What's that?

190
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,445
The moment when Aladdin
went to meet Princess Jasmine.

191
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,863
What?

192
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,908
You're like a street urchin,
and this is the palace!

193
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,120
OK, so then what does that make you?

194
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,830
I'm the Genie.

195
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,251
Why am I so nervous? This is stupid.
Let's get this over with, OK? Let's go.

196
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,837
Yeah. Let's go on a magic carpet ride.

197
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,358
No, I think it's good.
We have to act positive.

198
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,694
- Wendy!
- Hi! Congratulations, ladies.

199
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,196
- This party is so amazing.
- It is, right?

200
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:06,076
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Nice, Katie. Real classy.

201
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,997
I had a major laundry disaster. This is
the only dry bra that I have left.

202
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,458
- Do you want me to take it off?
- No!

203
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,211
- Just take a tray and circulate.
- Yeah, circulate. Know what that means?

204
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:26,013
Hey, excuse me.
I'm looking for Molly McCleish?

205
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,474
- Are you here to arrest her?
- No.

206
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,726
What about you?
You gonna search me?

207
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,895
No. No, I'm, I'm not TSA.

208
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,690
I can get you a mad discount
on a flight, if you want, though.

209
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,777
Molly's my sister. She's... up there.

210
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,071
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

211
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,449
Hey!

212
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,122
- Hey.
- Hey. This is Patty.

213
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,499
Hey.

214
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,964
- Oh, this is my friend, Devon.
- Princess Jasmine.

215
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,261
- Here's your phone.
- Oh, thank God.

216
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,847
You... Thank you.
You saved my life.

217
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,435
Oh, please. It's no big deal at all.
I think we're gonna get goin' now.

218
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,481
We're a bit overdressed for this.

219
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,775
- Yeah.
- Oh, no! You guys look great.

220
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,528
You should stay
and have a drink, right?

221
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,946
Know what? Excuse me one second.

222
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,282
Get a drink, but don't get it
from my sister's tray.

223
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,789
What's up, freckles?

224
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,668
...your friend's hot.

225
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,713
What'd she just say?

226
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,468
- "I think your friend is hot. "
- Yeah, right.

227
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,849
Seriously, Kirky,
do not josh me. All right? I need this.

228
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:57,604
Well, Devon, I would never josh you.
She said, "I think your friend is hot. "

229
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,106
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

230
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,191
- Yeah!
- Oh, stop.

231
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,277
- Yeah!
- No. No.

232
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,487
No, you... Devon,
you're happily married.

233
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,948
You and I both know
you'd never cheat on Karen.

234
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,992
Yeah, you're right. I don't need to.

235
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,286
Know why? 'Cause that girl
thinks I'm hot.

236
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,164
Know what? Don't tell Karen about this.

237
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,292
- No.
- Stuffed mushroom?

238
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,459
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

239
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,004
I dropped 'em on the floor,
but five second rule.

240
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,382
- Good. Thank you.
- It's OK, I'll wait.

241
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,675
Suit yourself.

242
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,011
- What the...?
- Shit.

243
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,555
- What the hell are you doing?
- I am so sorry, sir.

244
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,889
I... I...

245
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,850
- What?
- I don't know.

246
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,935
- Katie!
- No, no, no, not Katie.

247
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,187
This is all my fault.
I'm very, very sorry.

248
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:46,236
Can I see your invitation?

249
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,991
Probably not the best thing
to say to the museum director.

250
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,369
True, but we should do
cultural events like this more often.

251
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,247
Kirk! Oh, my God.

252
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,085
Patty told me what happened.
What can I say? I'm so sorry.

253
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:07,883
My reputation in the arts community may
be shot, but I think I'll get over it.

254
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,718
Know what?
I'd like to make it up to you.

255
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,721
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yeah, yes. Yes.

256
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,225
We handle some of the Penguins events,
we've got seats for the Islanders game.

257
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,979
- Do you like hockey?
- Do I like hockey? Yes, I do.

258
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,940
Great. There's two tickets.
So, maybe, bring a friend.

259
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,234
Wow, thank you so much.
That's amazing.

260
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,363
- And the tickets will be at will call.
- OK.

261
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,198
- Bye.
- Bye.

262
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,078
- Bye.
- Good night.

263
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,997
Fare thee well, dear princess.

264
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,417
Until our magic carpets alight
from Agrabah to the Cave of Wonders

265
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,755
for a night of romance... and hockey.

266
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,761
- I'm taking Stainer.
- Are you serious?

267
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,098
- No. no. no. that's...
- Yeah.

268
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,852
She's not into me. There are very few
things that I am absolutely certain of.

269
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,190
- This chick does not like me.
- Oh, don't be such a Laydown Larry.

270
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,777
I'm not being a... "Laydown Larry?"

271
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,613
It's just like me sayin'
that I'll never go to the moon,

272
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,281
I'm all right with that, too.

273
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,617
You don't want to
go to the moon? Bullshit.

274
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,161
No, I am saying that
I never will go to the moon,

275
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,081
and that's fine
because I never expected to.

276
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,458
You don't know that.
Technology and stuff.

277
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,460
- You might go to the moon.
- He's right.

278
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:30,215
No. This girl is, like, fuckin' hot!

279
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,176
Yeah, but you said that shit
about Marnie and, let's face it,

280
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,137
Marnie was kind of a skank.

281
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,722
- Hi.
- Hey.

282
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,851
Marnie. We were just talking about

283
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,646
Marnie, the name... And how it's
unfortunate that it's not more common.

284
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,106
Fuck you, Stainer.

285
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,151
You didn't let me finish.
More common for skanks.

286
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,573
Hey, Kirk, so are you gonna go to
Branson with your folks next month?

287
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,491
- I don't think so.
- 'Cause they invited

288
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,660
me and Ron to come along,
and we'd love to go,

289
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,829
but not if it's gonna be weird for you.

290
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,752
Tickets are non-refundable, and I love
Branson, but it's totally up to you.

291
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,673
- Yeah, no, you should go. It's fun.
- Thanks. OK.

292
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,468
- OK...
- I... That's...

293
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:21,558
OK, so she's taking her new boyfriend
to Branson with your parents.

294
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,353
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

295
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,023
Penguins are facing off
against the Islanders.

296
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,775
What do you think
are the keys to the game?

297
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,568
- I got the first one.
- Thank you very much.

298
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,237
I got a 20. Four beers, please.

299
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,531
Three?

300
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,533
Two?

301
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,120
- He seemed nice.
- That was all of my money.

302
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,501
- Oh, my God. She's here.
- What?

303
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,796
- That chick, from the airport?
- I'll try and call him tomorrow.

304
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,672
Didn't think she was gonna show. Hi!

305
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,092
- Hey. So you got the tickets OK?
- Oh, yeah. Thank you so much.

306
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,178
- Cool. Oh, you remember Patty.
- Hi.

307
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,223
Hi, there. Of course.
I didn't think that you were coming.

308
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,810
- I just... This is amazing.
- Hey.

309
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,478
Stainer.

310
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:08,605
I'm sorry?

311
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,982
- Stainer.
- What?

312
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,151
- Stainer.
- His name is Stainer.

313
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,403
- Right.
- Just a non-descript nickname.

314
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,366
Doesn't mean anything,
you know. It's like Greg.

315
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,827
You look like someone
I went to high school with.

316
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,205
- What high school? Maybe it was me.
- No, he's in a coma.

317
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,459
Who brought the good news bear?
Somebody give her some fucking honey.

318
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,920
OK, should we just
meet you up at the seats?

319
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,922
- Yeah, perfect.
- OK.

320
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,926
- Kirk, that Molly girl's insanely hot.
- Yeah, I know.

321
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,928
- So you know what's happening.
- What's that?

322
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,513
She's setting you up with
the bitchy friend.

323
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,599
Perfect for you,
'cause you like bitches.

324
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,852
Yeah, well, that's fine.

325
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:51,565
Patty's not a bitch, she's different.

326
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,776
Yeah, different in that she's a bitch
and other people aren't.

327
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,617
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Come on!

328
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,747
- Will! Will!
- Pass it, pass it!

329
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,460
Come on, Averill,
play the man, not the puck!

330
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,129
Yeah, come on, dick!

331
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:17,132
I'm sorry, the player that
I was screaming at is a forward,

332
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,010
but for some reason he keeps
hanging back at the blue line

333
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,928
- with the defensemen.
- You realize they're

334
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,806
hanging back 'cause
they're trying to kill a power play.

335
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,228
That is exactly what's happening.

336
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,481
Damn it, Fox, keep your stick down!

337
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,777
- That felt good.
- Yeah.

338
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,281
She knows a strange amount
about hockey.

339
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,741
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

340
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,162
Hey, Mol.

341
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,999
What... Scott Reese knows you?

342
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,377
- A little.
- Little bit.

343
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,464
Come on, Reese, pick it up!
You suck today!

344
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,347
- What a save!
- Oh, my God, he caught that.

345
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,103
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!
- He's such a freak!

346
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,544
- I'm gonna get some drinks.
- OK.

347
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,464
- I'm gonna get some beers, guys.
- Oh, OK.

348
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,218
I see what's goin' on.
Yeah, I'll get some beers with you.

349
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,220
Turn your attention to the center ice...

350
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:49,516
- You two stay here. You know, talk.
- I know.

351
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,438
Hi.

352
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:59,067
...Charlie Slaughter from Brookline.

353
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,320
- Ye olde intermission.
- ... pick a winner!

354
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,245
Listen, while we have a minute here,
Molly's always trying to set me up.

355
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:14,249
That's why she brought me along, but
honestly I'm not interested, no offense.

356
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:19,671
No offense taken. I assume that
I am probably not your type.

357
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,673
I was talking about Stainer.

358
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,927
What? What do you think, we're on, like,
a double date or something?

359
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,264
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah, but that'd mean that Molly...

360
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,393
- No.
- Yes.

361
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,770
Kirk, Molly's into you.

362
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,321
Yeah! It's effortless.

363
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,282
Listen, Kirk, I love you,

364
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,285
but there's no way on the planet
that Molly is into you.

365
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,038
Why would she bring a friend
and give you two tickets?

366
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,791
Well, Molly brought Patty for you,
but Patty thought you were a moron.

367
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,668
OK, now I know you've gone crazy.

368
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,963
You're telling me the hottest chick
I've met in my life wants you,

369
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,633
and the Hamburglar wasn't into me?
Listen to yourself. Fuck you.

370
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,801
Fuck...

371
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,304
That's a pretty impressive catch, Kirky.

372
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,640
Right. The day that that happens is
the day that Jack sleeps with your wife.

373
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,856
- What, did that already happen?
- We weren't technically dating yet.

374
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,649
My bad.

375
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,943
Are we gonna talk
or are we gonna bowl?

376
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,946
All I'm saying is,
this girl's too hot.

377
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,283
I mean, no judgment on Kirky,
but the guy's just outgunned here.

378
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,411
- Yo, House Ball!
- "House Ball?"

379
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,746
Yeah, I was up first.

380
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:42,295
- OK. OK. My bad.
- For fuck sake! Hey!

381
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,423
- What is it with you people?
- Hey, he can just wait his turn.

382
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,425
Oh, really? All this noise and shit,

383
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:51,179
and my best friend is such a distraction
in your goddamn peripheral vision?

384
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,224
All right, take it easy.
It's all good. Let him do his thing.

385
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,226
Well, fuckin' roll then.

386
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,487
- Bring it, Brunswick!
- I'm here. Let's do this, come on.

387
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,911
You feel strong, tough guy?

388
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,371
- Walk!
- You piece of shit!

389
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,039
- Get off!
- All right, come on.

390
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,249
- TSA, motherfucker!
- Don't!

391
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,000
He's lucky.

392
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,586
- He's an asshole.
- I'm really sorry.

393
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,424
OK, anyway... I love Kirky,
but let's face it, the guy's a five.

394
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,428
Stainer, that's just dirty pool.
He's at least a six.

395
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,390
A six? You go ahead and
pump rainbows into his asshole,

396
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,518
- but I'm just being honest.
- Come on, cut him some slack. Look.

397
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,854
Half a point 'cause
he's a nice guy. Right?

398
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,566
And he's funny, so that's half
a point each. That brings him to six.

399
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,775
Devon's right.

400
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,944
But he drives a shitbox, deduct a point.

401
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,405
- Take a point off.
- What's wrong with my Neon?

402
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:54,075
I don't know. Except the people
that make that car don't even like it.

403
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,370
- So we're back to a five.
- Five.

404
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,498
Meanwhile, this Molly is a hard ten.

405
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,376
And that five point disparity,
that is a chasm.

406
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,544
- Chasm?
- Yeah.

407
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,963
Chasm. You can't jump
more than two points.

408
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,464
Where do you get this shit?

409
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,884
Trust me, Kirk.
I can't even get a ten.

410
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,137
- Oh, not even you, huh?
- I'm a six, OK?

411
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,222
Bullshit, you're a six!
Then what am I?

412
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,850
- You're an eight.
- OK, fine, you're a six then.

413
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,102
But I get a one point bump
'cause I'm in a band.

414
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,605
Stainer, you're in a
Hall and Oates cover band!

415
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,942
- I'm pretty sure that's a deduction.
- Adult Education is a tribute band.

416
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,819
So that puts me back at a seven.

417
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,113
On a good day,
the best I can bag is a nine.

418
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,033
- What about your crappy car?
- Artist's exemption.

419
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,784
I'm expected to have a shitty car.

420
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,287
Is there an artist's exemption
for talkin' out your ass?

421
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,623
Yeah. It's called
bein' a rock star, Jack.

422
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,834
Look it up in the dictionary.
It's there. Next to "Fuck you!"

423
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,587
Guys, I think this system's ridiculous.

424
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,799
All right? If someone really loves you,
then you are a ten.

425
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,385
My God. What, are...
Are you Hannah Montana?

426
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,473
Because nothing you're saying
right now is of any help to Kirk.

427
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,271
What?!

428
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,777
Hello? Hello! Hey, Molly.

429
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,446
I'm well, thank you. How are you?

430
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,991
First of all, thank you. Yeah,
it was great. It was incredible.

431
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,952
Thank you so much. No...

432
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,457
Kirky, what'd she say?

433
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,921
I think she just asked me out.

434
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,340
Yeah! Way to go, Kirkers!

435
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,596
Hey, did she say anything, you know,
about Wendy thinkin' I'm hot?

436
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:43,101
- Oh, no.
- Shoot. I wonder if she's on Facebook.

437
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,981
- Devon, you're on Facebook?
- Yeah. I got like 37 friends.

438
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,524
Oh, cool.

439
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,199
Moll, what about this
for your date tonight?

440
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,868
Katie, that's the most
disgusting thing I've ever seen.

441
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,665
Wait. You have a date with Kirk?

442
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,377
When do you want the
bad date bail-out call?

443
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:10,628
I don't want it.

444
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,880
No, seriously,
work emergency or aunt died?

445
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,883
- I'm not gonna need it.
- Whatever.

446
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:18,803
What is your problem with Kirk?

447
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,015
I don't have a problem with Kirk.
I have a problem with you dating Kirk.

448
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,224
Why?

449
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,894
You dated Cam and got hurt, so you
pick a guy like Kirk because he's safe.

450
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,189
Yeah. Or maybe because
he's just a nice guy.

451
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,108
He's great. I just...

452
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,153
You and I know he's not the
kind of guy you usually end up with.

453
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,904
Yeah, I know.

454
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,783
Ah, goddamn it.

455
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,999
Way to go. What happened to you?
You look like shit. Besides that.

456
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,336
I got, like, 30 minutes
of sleep last night.

457
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,920
What do I even say to Molly tonight?

458
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:57,383
Like, what, do I just talk about
her ridiculous hotness for two hours?

459
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,178
I don't know. You were
pretty smooth at the hockey game.

460
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:04,015
Thanks, man. Well, that's because
I didn't think I stood a chance in hell,

461
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:08,227
but now that she's asked me out
I don't get it. It boggles my mind.

462
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,230
Why would she ask me out?

463
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,274
- Are you dying?
- What?

464
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,235
You maybe have some
rich benefactor in a top hat

465
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,404
who's trying to
set you up before you die.

466
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,948
Like Great Expectations.
Have you read that book?

467
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,450
- Yeah, man.
- It's so weird!

468
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:26,079
No, Stainer, I'm not terminally ill.
Thank you for your concern.

469
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,040
- Then that's a brain-teaser, isn't it?
- Tell me about it.

470
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,378
- You know, let's go this way.
- Who is that?

471
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,922
What?

472
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,634
Nobody. Just some chick
that I boned when I was drunk.

473
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,761
She's a total psycho. Let's go this way.

474
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,471
- It's quicker. Come on.
- What?

475
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,060
This place is tremendous.

476
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,815
It's... I'm just trying to think
whether or not I've been here before.

477
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,901
Is this real silver?
This is gorgeous stuff.

478
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,739
It has this lovely terrace area.

479
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:06,327
It's open. It's kind of like
eating on the Today Show set.

480
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,663
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

481
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,055
So you speak French?

482
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:31,269
No, barely. I probablyjust asked
for directions to the beach.

483
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:36,315
That's amazing. Any other
hidden talents I should know about?

484
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:41,529
- I'm a lawyer.
- You're a lawyer?

485
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,865
I know. I, well, I'm not real...

486
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,160
Oh, I'm sorry, one second. I...
Ma'am? Ma'am, you... Yeah...

487
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,369
I'll be right back.

488
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,331
Don't know what they were thinking.
If they moved, changed their number.

489
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,001
Excuse me. Ma'am!
You forgot your sweater.

490
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,170
- Thank you.
- Thanks again.

491
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,173
Oh, no, I don't work there.

492
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,674
- I...
- It isn't...

493
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,135
- I'm just returning your sweater.
- Thank you.

494
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,137
- Sure. Have a good night.
- Thank you.

495
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,434
- Sorry.
- Sorry, buddy.

496
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,727
- Thank you.
- Evening.

497
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:17,064
- Evening.
- Evening.

498
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,233
- Evening.
- What's up?

499
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,656
- Cam?
- Mol! Hey!

500
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,575
- Hey! I...
- I'll see you guys there.

501
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:31,412
- I thought you were still in New York.
- Negative. I flew in this morning.

502
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,914
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

503
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,583
- Oh, this is Kirk.
- Hey.

504
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,919
- Oh, hey, buddy. Oh, thank you.
- Yeah...

505
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,884
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, you bet.

506
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,763
I'll take an Armagnac. The lady'll
have a dirty martini with three olives.

507
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:52,642
- Thanks. Her favorite.
- I think there's been a mistake.

508
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,102
- Sorry, friend?
- He's with me.

509
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,278
Honest mistake.
Sorry. There you go.

510
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,323
- Please.
- That's awkward.

511
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,285
- Cam, this is Kirk.
- It's great to meet you, sir.

512
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,956
Great to meet you, sir.
Cam? Is that short for Cameron?

513
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,084
- No.
- Why would it be?

514
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:21,128
That's funny.
Your friend is funny, Molly.

515
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,757
- Thank you so much.
- Am I gonna see you next week?

516
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,553
Patty and I are working at the
air show and Cam's our liaison guy.

517
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,889
"Liaison guy. " Ouch!

518
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:36,394
We were more than that, huh?
You see Molly and I used to date.

519
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,400
Well, I'm out.
It was great to meet you, sir.

520
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,819
- See you, honey.
- All right. Bye.

521
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,323
Bye, Cam! He seems great.
He seems really great.

522
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,867
- Should we order? OK.
- Yeah.

523
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,996
So I was interning at the law firm.
studying for the bar.

524
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,498
but I just kept thinking...

525
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,669
Is this what I really
want to do with my life?

526
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:06,173
And then I volunteered to plan
the holiday party, and I loved it.

527
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:10,177
And so I quit the firm,
went into business with Patty.

528
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:14,557
Well, you found somethin'
that you love. That's amazing!

529
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,517
Yeah. Yeah, it is amazing.

530
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,769
Anyway, I'm bored of me.
What about you?

531
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,271
Oh, me.

532
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,191
Pittsburgh born and bred.

533
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,488
I wanted to go to college, but my dad
bought a swimming pool instead.

534
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:34,118
So my boy, Stainer,
hooked me up with myjob at TSA

535
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,371
and the rest is rock 'n' roll history.

536
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:43,294
So TSA today.
Is there a tomorrow or...?

537
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,212
Oh, I don't know.

538
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,508
Some days I'll be at work
and I'll look out the window

539
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,888
and I'll see all those planes
takin' off, goin' places, and I think

540
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,849
I could really do that, you know.

541
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:01,854
And it wouldn't matter if it was
jetliners or cargo planes or whatever.

542
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:06,734
I just would really love
that feeling of freedom.

543
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,862
Yeah. I know what you mean.

544
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,323
So now you know my big secret.

545
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,118
- You should do that, Kirk.
- Well, thank you.

546
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:19,580
It was easy for you to say.
You switch jobs at the drop of a hat.

547
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,457
No! No! Not at all!

548
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,751
My parents don't even know
I quit the firm.

549
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,920
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

550
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,839
My dad's an old-fashioned guy.

551
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:33,010
He's all about security
and steady paychecks.

552
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:39,475
And I guess we have a problem
with communication, and...

553
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,313
I would like that
not to be the case.

554
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:48,109
And maybe, maybe, one day it won't be.

555
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,610
Yeah.

556
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,656
- Do you have to get that?
- OK.

557
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,036
- No, you know what? It's fine.
- Really?

558
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,621
Yeah.

559
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,125
This is Molly McCleish.
I'm sorry I missed your call.

560
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,293
- Please leave a message...
- What?!

561
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,125
Never been driven home
by a waiter before.

562
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:51,255
- No. No, nobody usually is.
- Oh, right.

563
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,258
- I had a really nice time.
- Yeah?

564
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,386
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Me, too.

565
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,809
You're not thinking about Cam, are you?

566
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:09,732
No. "Cam who?" Is how I feel. No...

567
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,986
I've completely forgotten
how good-looking he is,

568
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:19,200
and how beautifully moisturized
his skin tones are.

569
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,452
OK. Well...

570
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,579
Oh, my seat belt is screwed up.

571
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:26,040
Wait, wait.
It goes in the goddamn correct...

572
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,056
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

573
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:48,813
She kissed you.
She, with her actual mouth, kissed you?

574
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,481
On purpose?

575
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,693
- Yeah, yeah, man, I know.
- I'm so happy for you, Kirky.

576
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,404
I'm not. I'm really nervous.

577
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,241
I mean, it feels like
the universe is outta tilt.

578
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,701
You know? One of us is gonna die.

579
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,579
What's the next step here?
We gonna take this up a notch?

580
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,040
I'm referring to
sexual relations, Devon.

581
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,501
She's comin' to lunch
with my parents on Sunday.

582
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,503
What? Why?
Why would you do that?

583
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,381
You can't do that, dude.
You're jumping six steps!

584
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:19,426
Well, I... She asked me. I don't know.
What was I supposed to say?

585
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,262
That takes care of that.

586
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,474
I mean, 20 minutes with your family
and she'll file for a restraining order.

587
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:29,019
- We're safe.
- Hey, did she say anything about Wendy?

588
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,688
You know, like, about me?

589
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,577
OK, move it.
Move it, move it, move it, move it.

590
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,704
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- Mom?

591
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,832
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- Oh, hi, sweetie!

592
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,221
- Hi. I'm Kirk's mom.
- Hi. I'm Molly.

593
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,932
- Hi!
- Nice!

594
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,726
- To meet you.
- Yes.

595
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,145
Hi. I'm Molly.
Nice to meet you, too.

596
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,148
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Where's your restroom?

597
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,276
- Right through there.
- Thanks. I'm gonna use the restroom.

598
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,569
- Yeah.
- OK.

599
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,821
- Through there? OK.
- Yeah, through there.

600
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,324
- Oh, we don't flush number ones.
- Sorry?

601
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,160
Nothing! Jesus Christ, Dad! That's...

602
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,453
- What?
- She's a guest.

603
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,873
- Though we'd make one exception?
- We got very delicate plumbing.

604
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,667
- I...
- Honey. She's really cute!

605
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,502
- She's beautiful.
- All that hair!

606
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,504
- Yeah.
- You wanna watch the Jap show?

607
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,220
- Nailed it.
- Dylan! I...

608
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,057
I was explicitly told
that you wouldn't be here today.

609
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,684
I thought you were
hangin' drywall or somethin'.

610
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,478
Leroy fired him again.

611
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,314
Whatever. Like that dick
never came to work with a buzz on.

612
00:37:55,482 --> 00:38:00,110
I brought a girl with me,
so I am begging you,

613
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,072
from the bottom of my heart,
please don't be a jerk,

614
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,824
- and I'll do anything you want.
- Slap Shot Regatta.

615
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,330
How long was I down there for?
What's my time? What's my time?

616
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,249
- Nope. Only 58 seconds.
- Damn it!

617
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,212
- Hey, there, pirate!
- So, Ron, you're here.

618
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,631
- That means that...
- Oh, yeah!

619
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,259
Who wants it? Who wants it?
Who wants it? I'll show it!

620
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,178
- I'll show it!
- Yeah!

621
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:30,391
Oh, yeah! Stop it, guys.

622
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,560
- Boner Patrol!
- Hey, Kirk.

623
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,606
Hi, there. Everybody, this is Molly.

624
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,400
Molly, this is everybody.

625
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:44,238
That's my brother, Dylan,
his fiancėe, Debbie

626
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:49,326
and my... Marnie and Ron.

627
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,286
Hey, everybody!

628
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,836
This is when you say, "Hi, Molly. "

629
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,046
- Who are you?
- She's Molly.

630
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,216
- Why is she here?
- She came with me.

631
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:07,761
- You hit her car or something?
- Jesus. No, but thank you for asking.

632
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,346
- You his social worker?
- Nope.

633
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,390
- Shit, are we being evicted?
- No.

634
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,599
- You a hooker?
- Dylan!

635
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,435
- Or a prostitute, I mean?
- Oh, my God.

636
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,562
Kirk and I were having dinner
and he said he was

637
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,523
getting together with his family.
It's been a while since I had

638
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,151
a family dinner,
so I hope you don't mind.

639
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:26,155
- I just invited myself along.
- Well, come on in for a dip, girl!

640
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,448
- Yeah!
- Ron!

641
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,908
- I don't have a bathing suit.
- Wear your underwear.

642
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,870
- Yeah.
- Like a bikini. Covers the good shit.

643
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,039
- Yeah, underwear is fine.
- Ron!

644
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,374
It's like what they did in the old days.

645
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,209
Underwear would be fine...

646
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,754
...if I were wearing any.

647
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,931
- Lunch is ready!
- I'm comin'!

648
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,643
Jeez.

649
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,651
- My mom makes awesome meatloaf.
- Oh, cool.

650
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:10,616
- After you.
- Sure you want another one, Dad?

651
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:13,035
What are you, my sponsor? Hit me!

652
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,622
Ron, honey, I never
complimented you on your...

653
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,124
...on your sweater vest. It's something!

654
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,334
Here you go.

655
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,836
Dylan, I think if you
just apologized to Leroy,

656
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,922
- he'll take you back.
- No, screw him.

657
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,176
- Got a foolproof moneymaker on the way.
- You're gonna want to pay attention.

658
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,137
I know how to make any car
into a convertible in 15 minutes, so...

659
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,181
- Wow.
- Yeah. You know why?

660
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,350
- No.
- Two words: Global warming.

661
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:39,520
Actually, Dylan, according
to The Day After Tomorrow.

662
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,605
the film, the Earth
actually gets colder.

663
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,148
Yep.

664
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,861
What's, what's up... with you?
Are you...? These days?

665
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,030
- What?
- Want me to help you with the gar...?

666
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,199
Fuck it. You seriously
not wearing any underwear?

667
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,867
- Dylan!
- We're all thinkin' it.

668
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,788
If you want to plan an exit strategy
or leave right now, I won't be offended.

669
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,457
- No, I'm not going anywhere.
- What do you do?

670
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,209
- I'm an event planner.
- See?

671
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,962
That's a business to get into.
That's usin' your head.

672
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,839
- Thank you, Dylan.
- No, wait for it.

673
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,008
Book a band, blow up balloons, people
pay out the ass for that, don't they?

674
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,677
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they do.

675
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,731
I'm not wearing any underwear.

676
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:31,613
Hey, Molly. Molly. Check it out.
So Deb and I are gettin' hitched.

677
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,699
How much cash
do you pocket for a wedding?

678
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,201
Any of this striking you
as inappropriate?

679
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,829
We're making conversation.
Don't get your panties in a wad.

680
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,706
- Jesus.
- No, it's fine.

681
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,583
A lot of factors affect the cost.

682
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,668
Check it out. We got
about 100 peeps coming.

683
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,503
We're doin' a NASCAR theme in Vegas.

684
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,090
I'm gonna get this kick-ass dress
made outta actual checkered flags,

685
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,594
like real tight, then Dylan's
gonna be in a wicked orange tux

686
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,347
with a Home Depot logo on the back.
What's up, right? Right?

687
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,391
You've never seen anything like that?

688
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,435
- Should be extensive.
- What's the damage on that?

689
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:04,938
My base fee is 15,000. So 100 people...

690
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,150
I mean, I'd ballpark that
somewhere around 50 grand.

691
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,532
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

692
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,409
- What?!
- Fuck you!

693
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,786
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

694
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,955
- Fuck you!
- Fuck!

695
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,708
That's a lot of
15 minute convertibles, Dylan?

696
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,127
Wait, so you make a
pretty comfortable living?

697
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,295
Sometimes.

698
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,381
You got your head on right.
And you don't do underwear.

699
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,467
What the hell are you
doin' with numbnuts?

700
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,052
- Dylan!
- Honey, what?

701
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,055
- No, hey, whoa, fair question.
- That's a fair question?

702
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:42,976
- Molly, I am so sorry.
- It's fine. You know, I mean...

703
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,146
Well, I don't...
I don't really know.

704
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,859
No, he makes me laugh.
He doesn't try and impress me.

705
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,656
And I can just be me around him.

706
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,325
- Oh, that's sweet.
- She's a keeper.

707
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,161
Kirk makes you laugh?
You a comedian? I didn't know.

708
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,829
Tell us a joke there, Sinbad.

709
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,457
I totally understand
what you're talking about.

710
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,584
The curse of being
an attractive woman.

711
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,045
I mean, men are always
putting us on a pedestal,

712
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,422
expecting us to be
something that we're not.

713
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,300
- "Us?"
- Come on, Marnie, get real.

714
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:19,513
- What?
- OK. You know, Molly,

715
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:23,558
we are taking a big family trip
out to Branson on the 31st,

716
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,603
- and I think you two should come.
- I think you're wrong.

717
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,523
- Gotta come to Branson.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

718
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,566
- You should come!
- We don't have room.

719
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,902
- They've got shows.
- Kenny Rogers' got his own theater.

720
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,487
We'll get a ticket.
I'll get you a ticket.

721
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,364
- Branson's small.
- Branson's a big place!

722
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,908
- Shut up, Ron.
- Can we go?

723
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,662
- It's your call.
- OK. Well, I'll see what I can do.

724
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,747
- Hey, hot dog!
- Result!

725
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:46,915
All right, relax.

726
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,627
Molly, I think there's
something you should know.

727
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,881
Kirk and I used to be lovers.

728
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,386
If you stay with him long enough
he'll give you one of these.

729
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,763
- They're great.
- Thank you, Dylan.

730
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,724
That's mine. It's for my earrings.

731
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,354
Kirk, you look really good.

732
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,734
Thank you. You look really...
Thank you so much.

733
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,279
- It was fantastic meeting you!
- Oh, you, too.

734
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:20,365
You're so special and God, I just...

735
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,620
- Branson, think about it.
- OK.

736
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,414
OK?

737
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:32,377
- She's really great. Later, pirate.
- Yeah. Bye, pirate.

738
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:36,048
- Let me help you, Mrs. Kettner.
- Maybe you could wrap those potatoes.

739
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,343
Come on. You're a guest here.
You really don't have to do that.

740
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,844
Oh, I don't mind.

741
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,472
Ready? You and me, downstairs,
Slap Shot Regatta.

742
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,767
Man, we're not children anymore.
Do we really have to do this?

743
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,894
- Mom!
- Kirk, go play with your brother.

744
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,396
- We need some girl time.
- Yeah, you promised.

745
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,442
- So pad up, chickenshit!
- Yeah, I'll see you down there.

746
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,278
Aw, crap.

747
00:44:58,863 --> 00:44:59,905
Come on. Let's do this!

748
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:03,283
- Let's focus it up.
- Left side.

749
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,789
- That was lucky.
- He never saw it, but he stopped it.

750
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,084
Come on, Dylan, give it to him.

751
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,506
You think you're Mr. Hot Shit now
with your new chick?

752
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,133
What? No. Maybe I'm just
a bit lucky tonight. I...

753
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,177
- What are you?
- You're not better than me.

754
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:25,055
Take a look. All these trophies
say Dylan Kettner.

755
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:29,184
- First place. First place. MVP.
- I don't think I'm better than you.

756
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:33,313
I never said that. And maybe Molly's
a little better looking than I am.

757
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,148
A little? Are you shitting me?

758
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:38,485
OK, I think we can all agree
that Debbie here is one wicked hot box.

759
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,653
Thanks, babe.

760
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,154
This chick of yours
makes her look like a pig.

761
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:44,157
- What? You're an asshole! What?!
- See?

762
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,576
This girlfriend of yours
is already startin' shit!

763
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,748
Did you see that, Mom?!

764
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,044
One second! Butterfly!

765
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,765
- I want to have another baby!
- No, that's OK, sweetheart.

766
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,892
OK, boys, it's a tie.

767
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,772
There are no ties in hockey,
as there are no ties in life.

768
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:20,318
- True.
- Last shot. Winner takes all. Go!

769
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,946
OK, come on, you can do it.
He's got nothing.

770
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,490
He's got less than nothing.
Own it. You can do it.

771
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,577
Come on, Dylan! Get in the zone!
You're still my MVP, baby!

772
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,370
Kirk's just a skinny little loser!

773
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,539
- Jesus, Debbie.
- Man, I gotta sit down.

774
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,417
You want to do this? Let's do it.

775
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,662
- Damn it!
- There's always a next time.

776
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,998
- Fuck it!
- Dylan.

777
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,877
This floor's all slippery!
And these shoes are fucked for this!

778
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,087
- Dylan, hey! Sportsmanship.
- Fuck you!

779
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,089
- Time out.
- You guys take a time out

780
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,382
from bein' assholes!

781
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,260
Oh, God.

782
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,608
- I'll get us some wine.
- Yeah, cool.

783
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:51,076
- This place is gorgeous!
- Thank you.

784
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:56,623
This kind of reminds me of my place,
except for my place is a total shithole.

785
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,959
This is awesome.
How long have you lived...

786
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,003
- My God! What the fuck is that?!
- Oh, that's Captain Pickles.

787
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,798
I'm watching him
while my folks are on vacation.

788
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:08,802
What is he?
A dog or a fuckin' horse?

789
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,387
Sit down.

790
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,848
Wha... Me or the dog?

791
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,351
You. He doesn't like people standing.

792
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,729
He feels threatened by it.
He gets all, you know, angsty.

793
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:25,902
Hey, angsty, that's...
No, hey, I come in peace.

794
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,990
Thank you.

795
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,389
OK, wait.

796
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,726
I don't want to move too fast.

797
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,520
I... No, sure, no problem. No problem.

798
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:04,316
No, don't get me wrong.
I mean, once I trust a person

799
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:09,279
I can experiment
and get pretty generous.

800
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,782
Yeah, yeah, no, me, too. Me, too.

801
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:18,496
I... I'm...
I love, love, to experiment,

802
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:23,585
and I get really generous.
I can be very, very generous.

803
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:28,840
I am quite the charitable lover.

804
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,780
I got... Can we stop for two secs?

805
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,074
No.

806
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,560
- Honey, you there?
- Dad?

807
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,939
"Dad?!" What the...? Oh, dear God!

808
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,482
Are you in?

809
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,945
- Hey!
- Hi...

810
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,614
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

811
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,199
- Shit.
- Told you we should call ahead.

812
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,659
We decided to come back early.

813
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,412
Thought we'd come by,
take the Captain off your hands.

814
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,205
Hope we aren't interrupting.

815
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,833
- Who's your little friend?
- Oh, God!

816
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,129
- Well, this is Kirk.
- Gerald McCleish. It's a pleasure.

817
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,631
Yeah.

818
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,885
- Nope. Nope.
- No?

819
00:50:56,053 --> 00:51:01,057
I don't... God, where are my manners?

820
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:05,520
You guys must be exhausted from
your travels. Please, hey, have a seat.

821
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,648
Put your... Put your feet up.
Really get into a groove.

822
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,358
- Thank you.
- Sure.

823
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:13,319
- That's kind of you.
- I think I have that same sweater.

824
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,487
Really?

825
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,829
So... that's...

826
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,542
Uh, no. Oh, Lord.

827
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,463
Oh, no, Captain Pickles.
No. No, Captain.

828
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,007
Pickles!

829
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,928
- Kirk?
- Excuse me.

830
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,848
Thank you for having me.
This has been a lovely evening.

831
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,560
Good night.

832
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,654
Awesome.

833
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,176
Devon, I'll give you 50 dollars
just to curse once.

834
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:21,638
- Seventy-five. Just say "fuck. "
- I won't, I won't say it out loud.

835
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,890
- I'll write it.
- That doesn't count!

836
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,226
- You're gonna what?
- I'll write it down.

837
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,394
That doesn't count!
You have to say it out loud.

838
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,439
- Why doesn't it count?
- Say "shit. " I'll give you 100.

839
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,483
- Hey.
- Hey, Kirk.

840
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,152
My shift doesn't start
for another half hour,

841
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,864
but I was so excited, so I came early.

842
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:44,244
Yeah, and it was weird. He said he was
really excited and so he came early.

843
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,912
Yeah. That ever happened to you?

844
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,040
You're so excited about something
that you come early.

845
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:52,335
Jesus Christ, you're Fort Knox
over here. Thank you very much.

846
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,630
I didn't mean to tell 'em, Kirky.
I'm sorry.

847
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,842
Come on, he couldn't help it.
It just, you know, slipped out.

848
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,261
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

849
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,930
Thank you very much.
And go fuck yourselves.

850
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,265
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, shit.

851
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,184
Kirk, can I talk to you for a second?

852
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,813
- In private.
- There are no secrets here, Marnie.

853
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,774
OK. Well,

854
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:20,405
I think I made a little mistake,
and I see a change in you,

855
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:23,449
and I really like it,
so let's get back together!

856
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,618
Just to try it out. You know?

857
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,249
That's really interesting.

858
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,459
No, I don't think so.

859
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,628
But you broke up with Molly.

860
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,882
- She cornered me.
- Jesus, Devon!

861
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,385
Look, Marnie, I moved on
like you kept telling me to.

862
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,138
You're here because some
other girl has shown interest.

863
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:49,726
That's not it! Look, Kirk,
I am really worried about you with her.

864
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:51,436
She seems like kind of a bitch.

865
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:55,148
So I'm just saying that
if you want to get back together,

866
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:57,692
- like you begged me before...
- Shh...

867
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,946
...I am even willing to consider
breaking up with Ron.

868
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,949
- What? You're still with Ron.
- The pirate?

869
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,827
Yeah. I'm not gonna risk
being all alone just 'cause

870
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,829
Kirk doesn't know what's good for him.

871
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:15,501
Look, Kirky. Deep down you know it is
never gonna work out with you and Molly.

872
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,921
And I just can't stand
to see you get hurt.

873
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:23,718
So if that makes me
the bad guy... so be it.

874
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:29,724
It's embarrassing.

875
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,603
Jesus Christ.

876
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,855
Hey.

877
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,858
Did you just come in your pants again?

878
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,819
You can tell us.
We're your friends. Did you?

879
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,322
Hey, why would you tell her
I broke up with Molly?

880
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,698
'Cause I thought you had.

881
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:49,702
- No. We're just in a sticky wicket.
- A "sticky wicket?"

882
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,704
Yeah, a rough patch. Rough pumpkins.

883
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,123
- How many times have you called her?
- Five.

884
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,209
How many times have you
really called her?

885
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:59,879
- Seventeen.
- It's done, man. Tao of Love.

886
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,048
- What?
- That's what I call it.

887
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:06,594
The Tao of Love. You being with Molly
defies, like, forces of nature.

888
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:10,014
- It's over, man.
- No. It's not over.

889
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:12,684
Frankly, I'm kinda sick
of you guys pretending

890
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,521
like you know where I'm comin' from.
None of you know what I'm goin' through.

891
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:20,024
- Tina Jordan does.
- Who the hell is Tina Jordan?

892
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,903
- She was my Molly.
- You never mentioned her.

893
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:27,699
I didn't want to jinx it.
But she was perfect.

894
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,242
Yeah, perfect.

895
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,578
Freckled shoulders.

896
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,666
Anyway, two months into it,
bam, she dumps me.

897
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,753
I shoulda seen it coming, too,
'cause she was a ten. Like a hard ten.

898
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:45,341
And I was a six, possibly a seven.
Either way, I couldn't cover the spread.

899
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:51,055
The universe spoke.
And I was depressed for months.

900
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,726
That's what that was?
You said you had mono.

901
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:59,188
- Yeah. Mono of the heart.
- Oh, my God. How's your vagina?

902
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,481
Shut up, Jack!

903
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:04,027
Dude, forget Stainer. All right?
I think you could get her back.

904
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,070
Why don't you look Kirk in the eyes

905
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,865
and tell him you believe
he's gonna end up with Molly.

906
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,450
- Just tell him that.
- Fine.

907
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:14,203
Kirky, I truly believe that...

908
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,459
I mean, I think anything's possible.

909
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,711
- "Anything is possible?!"
- Come on!

910
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,464
Like, there's a million
examples of guys like Kirky

911
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,383
- endin' up with beautiful women.
- Such as?

912
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,385
- Lyle Lovett and Julia Roberts.
- Right.

913
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,805
Richie Sambora and Heather Locklear.
Then he went on to Denise Richards.

914
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:36,142
Yeah. All recording artists.
Normal rules don't apply to those guys.

915
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,520
Kirk, as soon as you
record an album and it goes platinum,

916
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:42,482
you can push your meat into
any human being you want.

917
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:46,444
OK, OK. OK.
King Kong and Naomi Watts.

918
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,946
Never consummated.
Totally platonic relationship.

919
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:53,910
- Stephen Hawking and his lady nurse.
- He's the master of space and time!

920
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:57,538
- He knows about black holes and shit.
- What about the President of France

921
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,207
and that girl that
went out with Mick Jagger?

922
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,292
He knows about wine.
And has a French accent.

923
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,503
Can probably French kiss
like a motherfucker!

924
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,214
- Oh, OK, OK...
- Wait a second. The Beast.

925
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,592
- Who?
- The Beast! From Beauty and the Beast?

926
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,554
Beast won Beauty's love, and he wasn't
rich and he wasn't a recording artist.

927
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,850
- Though he did have an amazing voice.
- OK, Devon, that's a cartoon.

928
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,353
But, yes, that's one.
One out of a million.

929
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,897
You know what, Stainer?
All it takes is one.

930
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:26,275
Man, you... You guys just sit here
and talk about relationships,

931
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,278
but the truth is,
I'm the only one here that's married.

932
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,199
I'm tired of you guys bustin' my nuggets
'cause I've only been with one girl.

933
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:36,369
It's 'cause she was the right girl!
That's why I married her!

934
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:39,705
So, Kirky, let me tell you somethin'.
If Molly's the right girl,

935
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,209
that's all that matters.
You just you stand up.

936
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:46,879
You stand up, you get in front of her.
You get right in her grill and you say,

937
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,799
"Hey, I am Kirk Kettner

938
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:53,219
and I am right here,
standin' in front of you...

939
00:57:55,055 --> 00:58:00,143
...right here. Here I am. "

940
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,898
- Somethin' like that.
- The power of love.

941
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,108
- Beautiful.
- Moving.

942
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:08,276
Very... Perfect.

943
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,820
Thank you.
I was in debate, junior/senior year.

944
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,989
I don't know if you guys remember that.

945
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,787
Look at that.

946
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:43,936
Oh, there she is.

947
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,609
Listen to me, dude. Gotta go,
loud and proud, gotta tell her,

948
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,613
- "Hey, I jizzed in my shorts" you know?
- All right...

949
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,657
No! "That's what I do. OK?
It's how I roll. Deal with it. "

950
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,451
You know, I know I don't know...

951
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:02,038
I don't know much about this, but
that can't be good advice, I'm sorry.

952
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:05,958
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
- You have nothing to be embarrassed of.

953
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,754
If anything, you paid her
a compliment. Right?

954
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,132
- Yeah.
- Trust it.

955
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,842
Here goes nothin'.

956
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,472
Oh, shit, Molly. Six o'clock.

957
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,310
- Hey, Molly.
- Hey.

958
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,689
- Did you get my messages?
- Yeah, yeah, I got them, Kirk.

959
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,735
What the hell happened the other night?

960
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,279
You act like a freak
with Captain Pickles,

961
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,365
you won't get off the couch
to shake my father's hand

962
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,117
when we had a whole conversation
about how he was old-fashioned!

963
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,370
Yeah, I know. I know. I'm sorry.

964
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,539
I spent a whole day
with your entire family,

965
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,000
and you can't even spend
30 seconds with mine.

966
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,837
- I mean, that's a pretty big red flag.
- It is not a red flag, Molly.

967
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,839
Oh, Kirk, I can't do this here.

968
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:58,552
- I'm working, and...
- OK. Sorry.

969
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,857
I ejaculated in my pants.

970
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:28,332
We were getting sort of
hot and nasty, you know...

971
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,877
It's not every day
that I have a super-hot girl

972
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:36,757
grinding on top of me,
and I got a little too excited and,

973
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,760
before I know it, your parents
are in the room and I'm there

974
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:45,850
with just a big friggin'
oyster in my shorts.

975
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:53,232
Right. Sorry. Sorry.

976
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,411
I mean, I'll say this for him.
He's honest.

977
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:10,541
So thanks for the advice.
That went horribly.

978
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:14,045
Enjoy the air show, boys.
I'm going to go...

979
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:19,342
No guy in his right mind
would ever make that up.

980
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,926
Right?

981
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,763
You should probably go talk to him.

982
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,183
- Yeah.
- Just wait one second.

983
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,852
And... here she comes.

984
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,563
- Kirk!
- Yes!

985
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:33,731
Yeah.

986
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,526
She told him a joke or somethin'.
Something's funny.

987
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:41,447
They're ki... They're gonna ki...
They're kissing! Yes!

988
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:44,158
- You're like Yoda.
- Yeah, I know.

989
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:48,662
Like Sex Yoda.
"The Force is strong with you, Jack. "

990
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,207
Trust the system.
It takes care of itself.

991
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,794
- Ah, that went well.
- Kinda.

992
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,424
Wow. She sure is somethin', isn't she?

993
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,136
- It's Kirk, right?
- Oh, God. Hi, Cam.

994
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,180
Excellent to see you again, sir.

995
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,724
Listen, Kirk.
Can I talk to you for a second?

996
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,227
Yeah, I guess so. See ya.

997
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:16,440
Listen, Kirk. I understand
that fellas, such as yourself,

998
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:20,152
have uniquely candid relationships
with the women that they befriend,

999
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,655
- am I right?
- Fellas such as myself?

1000
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:25,783
Don't get me wrong.
I have no problem with your lifestyle.

1001
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:29,745
What two or more grown men do
in the privacy of their own home,

1002
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,497
hell, it's of no concern to me.

1003
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,333
I don't know what Molly's
told you about me, all right?

1004
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:37,503
If she said anything bad,
let's face it, I probably deserve it.

1005
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:41,424
- Actually, Cam, we haven't...
- God as my witness, I'll get her back.

1006
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,800
Cool.

1007
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:45,594
Can I count on you to put in
a good word for me, Elton John?

1008
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,849
- Yeah, whatever gets this over with.
- You're the man, Kirk. Bring it in.

1009
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:54,019
- Yeah, yeah, you got it.
- You feel that tolerance?

1010
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,898
- Man, you gays smell good.
- That's good.

1011
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,818
This is awesome!
Does anybody have a camera?

1012
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,279
- Stainer.
- What?

1013
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,781
Wait a minute, dude.
Does that, does that say...?

1014
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:09,118
Yep, I think it does.

1015
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:13,539
- Jesus, man. Goddamn it.
- Did you guys get a picture?

1016
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:17,168
By the way, Kirk,
you can do better than these guys.

1017
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:21,547
I mean, this one is kinda cute,
but the other two... Oof!

1018
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,215
Show some pride, pal.

1019
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:31,807
Pittsburgh tower. Foot Long, you are
cleared for takeoff on runway two-zero.

1020
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,522
Roger that, tower. Turn and burn.

1021
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:41,525
Honestly, I'd have sex with that guy.

1022
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,070
Yeah, I would.

1023
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,748
- Fuck! You're lucky!
- Yeah!

1024
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,553
So how's your sister doin'?

1025
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,181
She turns 21 next week
and she's, I don't know,

1026
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,642
she still has no sense of direction.

1027
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:00,437
You know? She's coming over for dinner,
and I really want to give her advice,

1028
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,399
but I don't know
what to say to her, you know?

1029
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,026
So what do you...
You don't know what to say to her?

1030
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:09,822
She's only 20. She's not 30.
And she's not you.

1031
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:14,785
You know? When I was 20,
I did not have my act together, man.

1032
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:17,496
I mean, look at this kid now.

1033
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:21,000
I'm in TSA. I am livin' the dream.

1034
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,712
You're right.
Maybe I am being too hard on her.

1035
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,840
And, I'm sorry, but she's
comin' over for dinner?

1036
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:31,844
She's turning 21!
You gotta throw her a party.

1037
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:35,264
I mean, that's what you do for
a living, right? You throw parties?

1038
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:40,144
I can't believe I never thought of that.

1039
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:42,354
- That's a really good idea.
- Thanks.

1040
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,941
It's been ten dates and you can't
seal the deal? What's wrong with you?

1041
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:50,487
Listen to me. Things with Molly
are good, right? They're back on track.

1042
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:55,326
You have gotta recover from your little
oopsie-daisy, little early-bird special.

1043
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,827
Gotta get back in that ring.

1044
01:05:56,995 --> 01:06:00,205
It's just terrifying, frankly,

1045
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:04,084
the idea of me naked

1046
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:09,506
- in front of her... also naked.
- But what's to be terrified of?

1047
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,634
Because you've done
your prep work, right?

1048
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,427
Yeah... I think she likes me.

1049
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,220
- She really likes you.
- Thank you.

1050
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:19,224
That's cute. Yeah, good. But it's
not at all what I'm talking about.

1051
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:25,022
A girl like Molly, hot as shit,
manicured from fuckin' head to toe.

1052
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,315
- Yeah.
- Right?

1053
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:30,361
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Listen, I'm talkin' about this.

1054
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,155
- I'm talkin' about this.
- Your chin.

1055
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,699
- Yeah.
- And I'm talkin' about this.

1056
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,743
- Oh, jeez!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1057
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,244
- Look, guys!
- Jack!

1058
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,581
This is fine.
'Cause this is clean. It's organized.

1059
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:45,042
It's kind of
Japanese-looking, to be honest.

1060
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:47,252
Whatever you do,
don't look directly at it.

1061
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,923
I'll bet you Cam's balls
look like this. It's like a baby.

1062
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:55,886
It's just smooth. It's a look that says,
"Hey, you can put your mouth here. "

1063
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:59,181
- He is... He just moved.
- It's just a thought.

1064
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,933
Just tryin' to help, that's all.

1065
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,143
All right, Stainer,
let's get outta here.

1066
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:07,106
- Yeah, I'm hungry. I gotta go eat.
- Hey, Kirky. Prep work.

1067
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,900
You hear me? Out.

1068
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:33,966
God.

1069
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,677
OK.

1070
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,311
Here goes nothin'.

1071
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,278
Shoot! Kirky! Kirky!

1072
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,780
We shoulda done a hot towel.

1073
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:59,616
You know, like those
old-timey barbershops?

1074
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:03,162
- Helps raise the hairs.
- I don't like this!

1075
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:07,082
Kirk, if you want to abort the mission,
that's completely cool.

1076
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,836
I don't... I can't really
abort the mission right now.

1077
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:15,424
I've shaved approximately
one-third of my balls.

1078
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,843
I'll look pretty fuckin' stupid
if I stop now!

1079
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,262
Did you shave one ball
and then the other ball,

1080
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:23,182
- or are you workin' top to bottom?
- Shut up, shut up!

1081
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:28,771
You shut up. I mean, seriously,
just shave it like your face!

1082
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,147
I can't do it like my face!

1083
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,691
My face doesn't have
two testicles sticking out of it!

1084
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:35,694
If it did, I would grow
a pretty thick goddamn beard.

1085
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,196
Kirk.

1086
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,365
Kirk?

1087
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,745
- Do you need a hand?
- Oh, motherf...!

1088
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,214
There we go.

1089
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,385
So how is this not gay?

1090
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,387
I think there's nothing gay about it.

1091
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:06,642
The fact that you're lettin' a straight
married man shave your testicles...

1092
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,728
I think that makes you
one of the most macho guys alive.

1093
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,815
There is some logic in that.

1094
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,234
Thank you. You know what?
Can you pick that up?

1095
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,902
Can you pick 'em up for me?

1096
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,612
There it is.

1097
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,868
That's a lot. OK, drop 'em.

1098
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,749
Voilà!

1099
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:41,468
Take a look!

1100
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,096
What do you think?

1101
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,765
Devon!

1102
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,309
It looks fucking huge!

1103
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,943
My friends wonder why
I call you all the time

1104
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:01,822
What can I say?
Yeah, yeah

1105
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:08,787
Well, I don't feel the need
to give such secrets away

1106
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,250
Well, you think maybe I need help

1107
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:17,713
Though I know I'm right, all right

1108
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,591
I'm just better off

1109
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:25,929
Not listening to friends advice

1110
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:29,474
When they insist on knowing my bliss

1111
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,604
I tell them this

1112
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:37,816
When they want to know
what the reason is

1113
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:41,820
I only smile when I lie
Then I tell them why

1114
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,071
Because your kiss

1115
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,657
Your kiss is on my list

1116
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:46,992
Because your kiss

1117
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,453
Your kiss I can't resist

1118
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:52,497
Because your kiss is on my list

1119
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:56,460
Of the best things in life

1120
01:10:56,628 --> 01:10:58,420
Because your kiss

1121
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,430
All right, everybody, give it up
one more time for Adult Education!

1122
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:14,061
Awesome stuff. They're going to
play some more Hall and Oates for us,

1123
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:18,023
and maybe some other old favorites
from some other artists? No?

1124
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:21,360
- You're kidding me.
- Nope. Just... more Hall and Oates.

1125
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:26,365
Everybody, let's raise a glass
to Patty and Molly for throwing, by far,

1126
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,826
the coolest party I've ever
personally been invited to.

1127
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,579
Great job, girls.
Let's hear it for Patty and Molly!

1128
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:39,378
And now, to the gorgeous
birthday girl, Katie McCleish.

1129
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,171
You're 21 years old now.

1130
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,466
What else can I say?
Let life come to you.

1131
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,094
- Happy birthday, Katie!
- Thank you.

1132
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,846
All right, guys, enjoy the party.

1133
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,140
- Can you hold this for me?
- Why?

1134
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,893
Better with myjacket off.
Just ditch that somewhere.

1135
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,020
What? What am I
supposed to do with this?

1136
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,523
OK, now we're gonna
take it down. A lot.

1137
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:02,442
You're totally gonna
jump his bones tonight, aren't you?

1138
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:03,819
I don't know. Maybe.

1139
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,988
- Hey.
- Hey.

1140
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,491
I think it's time for you
to dance with me.

1141
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,251
Hey, Devon! Wendy, remember?

1142
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:22,546
No. No, I don't. I... Aw, shoot.

1143
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:25,257
I think this is the first time
we're meeting. Ever!

1144
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:27,426
- OK.
- This is my wife, Karen.

1145
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,885
- I'm Karen.
- Wendy.

1146
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,262
Nice to meet you.

1147
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:38,520
- That's good. OK, I'm gonna...
- OK.

1148
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,315
What?

1149
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,699
- Oh, there's my parents!
- What?

1150
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:53,785
Hey! Hey, let's go meet them.

1151
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:56,621
She's with that fuckin' asshole.

1152
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,958
- Hi!
- Hi!

1153
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,127
- Hey, baby...
- Dad, hi.

1154
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:06,131
- You remember Kirk.
- Yeah, how could we forget? Yeah.

1155
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:09,968
- Oh, this time we...?
- Hi, there.

1156
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:15,474
Mr. and Mrs. McCleish, from the
bottom of my heart, I am so sorry.

1157
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:19,895
The last time we met wasn't exactly
the world's greatest first impression.

1158
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:23,899
- No, it certainly was not.
- I promise you that I will grow on you.

1159
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:29,488
- I hear this party was all your idea.
- No, no. This is all Molly's.

1160
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,490
Hey, what line of work are you in, son?

1161
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,159
It's kind of a long story.
I grew up with my...

1162
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,036
- Kirk's in aviation.
- Another pilot?

1163
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:38,538
- Really?
- Oh, Molly likes the flyboys.

1164
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:39,998
Just like your mother.

1165
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:43,668
I flew choppers back in Nam, Saigon.
Evacuation, April, '75, that was...

1166
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:46,171
He's been pushing Molly
to take flying lessons.

1167
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,965
- After she passes the bar.
- Yeah. Flying!

1168
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:51,718
Hey, now here's a pilot! How are ya?!

1169
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,221
- You son of a bitch!
- Boy, good to see you!

1170
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,640
Good to see you.
Lucille, don't you look lovely.

1171
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:58,183
- Hello, Cam.
- What?

1172
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,436
- Kirky!
- I didn't think you were gonna be here.

1173
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,939
You bet. You know,
Ger and Lucille invited me.

1174
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:07,567
- What a pleasant surprise!
- Target acquired.

1175
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:09,277
- Cam... How's it going?
- Mol.

1176
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,072
Have you seen Katie?
Let's go see Katie.

1177
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,033
- OK. I'm... See you down there.
- Good to see you again, kid.

1178
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,245
Nice to see you... sir.
I'll see you down there.

1179
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,297
Mind if I join you?

1180
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:34,594
So Mollyjust explained
all about you two,

1181
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:38,306
and I gotta admit I feel like a jackass.

1182
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,100
Don't worry about it, man...

1183
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:43,770
It's all good.
I thought you were gay, too.

1184
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:51,069
- Just joking. I'm just joking.
- You are funny.

1185
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,697
- Thank you.
- All right, then...

1186
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,701
Take good care of her.
She's a special girl.

1187
01:14:57,869 --> 01:15:01,454
- Yeah, she's perfect.
- Oh, yeah, about that...

1188
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:05,083
Don't really call her that.
She doesn't like it.

1189
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:08,670
And, besides, she's not
exactly perfect anyway, right?

1190
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,005
What do you mean?

1191
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,175
All right, listen.

1192
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,722
Don't let it creep you out, OK?

1193
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,933
I mean, the first time
I saw her little defect...

1194
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,937
Woof! I'll admit it gave me the willies.

1195
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,732
But it might not bother you. Who knows?

1196
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,111
All right? And even if it does,
just try to be cool, you know,

1197
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,781
and you'll get used to it,
all right? Good luck.

1198
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,825
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1199
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,453
Please, this is...
This is very important.

1200
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:47,209
- Birth defect? What is it?
- I can't tell you that, man.

1201
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,586
Somethin' you're gonna
have to figure out for yourself.

1202
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:52,380
I'm out.

1203
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:57,802
Interesting.

1204
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:21,660
- OK, your turn.
- Yeah.

1205
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,671
Oh, shit.

1206
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:37,801
I haven't really been hittin'
the gym as much as I should lately.

1207
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:39,844
It's OK.

1208
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,815
Holy Moses.

1209
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:20,218
- Interesting.
- What, what? What?

1210
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,761
Nothing. Nothing.

1211
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,104
What's wrong?

1212
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:36,651
It's been a while and
I'm not very experienced sex-wise.

1213
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:41,281
- Kirk, please. Your balls are shaved.
- Oh, I know. I know.

1214
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:45,785
It's kind of a new thing I'm trying out.
It's a bad idea. It's...

1215
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,662
I feel like I'm eleven.

1216
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,707
What if I show you something
I'm self-conscious about?

1217
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,543
- Oh, that would be amazing.
- OK.

1218
01:17:56,213 --> 01:18:00,550
- Promise me you won't laugh.
- No, I, I... I promise.

1219
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:01,968
OK.

1220
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,018
What am I looking at?

1221
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:17,484
That's it?

1222
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,529
- That's your big defect?
- Webbed toes is not a defect!

1223
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,740
Yeah, no shit
webbed toes is not a defect!

1224
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:28,828
I was expecting some kind of
pulsating growth

1225
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,830
or a cluster of lumps...

1226
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:37,504
...or like a little dick that,
I don't know, talked.

1227
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:42,300
This is what... All you got is it's
inconvenient for you to wear flip-flops?

1228
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:45,637
Who told you I have a defect? Cam?

1229
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:47,764
Well, yeah.

1230
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:53,311
And as far as I can tell that's the
only thing separating you from perfect.

1231
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,857
You think I'm too perfect?

1232
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:02,612
So you were hoping there was something
wrong with me so you could be with me.

1233
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,115
Look at the evidence, Molly.

1234
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,158
It's...

1235
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:11,871
I'm unattractive,
I'm out of shape, I'm uncoordinated,

1236
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:16,376
I've never been to Europe, I'm not
a college graduate, I drive a Neon...

1237
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:20,255
- I like your Neon.
- Oh, God, come on, Molly, look at me.

1238
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:26,177
I'm a five. This is a five. Hard five.

1239
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,346
You can't jump more than two points.

1240
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,682
It's the Tao of Love.
Everybody knows that.

1241
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,268
Even if you were a nine,
and I was in a band,

1242
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:37,605
- but no, you're a hard ten.
- What are you talking about?

1243
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:42,193
Do you even know how hot you are?

1244
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:47,323
No, you probably think that everybody
gets free shit everywhere they go,

1245
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:51,870
and everybody's happy and nice to
each other in shiny, happy Hot Town,

1246
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,831
with you and all your hot friends
and ex-boyfriends,

1247
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:58,168
but I hate to break it to you,
it's not the same for the rest of us.

1248
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:03,298
OK, Kirk. You clearly have some
major self-esteem issues.

1249
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:06,634
You lied about me to your parents
right in front of me!

1250
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,512
- No, I didn't!
- "Kirk's in aviation?"

1251
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:15,059
That's like saying the guy who
shovels elephant shit at the circus

1252
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:19,230
is in show business.
No, he's just the elephant shit guy.

1253
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,566
That's me. I'm that guy.

1254
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:25,403
I'm never gonna be a pilot.
And I am happy with that.

1255
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,697
And I'm fine with that, too.

1256
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:31,326
And I was fine with you
up until about three minutes ago.

1257
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:33,995
That's... I'm so glad
that you were "fine" with me.

1258
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:37,582
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe you are a five.

1259
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:41,753
You know why?
No self-esteem, deduct a point.

1260
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:45,673
Every time someone walks into a room
you compare yourself to them,

1261
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:46,841
deduct a point.

1262
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,761
You're a smart and talented guy
who's afraid to do anything with it,

1263
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:51,596
deduct a point. How are we doing?

1264
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:52,931
Oh, yeah.

1265
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,936
Hoping that I have a defect
that you can work with?

1266
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,773
Deduct whatever's left.

1267
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:07,612
I'm outta here. Webbed fucking feet.
Are you kidding me?

1268
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,447
- Kirk!
- Hey, do me a favor.

1269
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,534
- Tell Foot Long I said hi.
- He's my ex-boyfriend, Kirk. Ex!

1270
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,495
- Know why we broke up?
- Because you guys couldn't decide

1271
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:18,039
- which one of you was hotter?
- No. Because he behaved

1272
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:21,626
exactly like you're behaving right now.
He couldn't handle it.

1273
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:24,128
He thought I was perfect,
he had me on a pedestal

1274
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,130
that I couldn't possibly live up to!

1275
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:29,092
Oh, and one other little thing?
He cheated on me.

1276
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:32,804
After that I said to myself, "I'm
not gonna date guys like that anymore. "

1277
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:35,557
Wait... "Guys like that?"
So, what, you're just...

1278
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,268
- You were gonna date guys like me?
- That what you wanna hear?

1279
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,144
That I asked you out 'cause you're safe?

1280
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,437
Keep goin'.

1281
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:44,065
That I thought that a guy
who looks like you wouldn't hurt me?

1282
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:47,860
Is that what you want to hear, Kirk?
Are you happy now?

1283
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,905
Yeah, I'm ecstatic.

1284
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:55,285
Kirk!

1285
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:19,851
Fuck.

1286
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:43,708
Six-Delta-Bravo,
flight cleared to land. runway two-two.

1287
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,300
- "List. " It's "list. "
- No, it's not. It's "lips. "

1288
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,302
- It's "list. "
- "Your kiss is on my lips. "

1289
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,470
Why'd it be "list?"

1290
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:57,347
"It's on my list
of the best things in life. "

1291
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,640
- Stainer.
- What?

1292
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,058
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Kirk.

1293
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,561
Where have you been?
Here. Tune it.

1294
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:07,899
Oh, shit.

1295
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:11,235
So you're all "Branson bound," huh?

1296
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:15,740
Yeah. They were Marnie's idea.

1297
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,742
OK, Kirky, let's go.

1298
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,911
- OK, I'll see you guys later.
- Relax.

1299
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,664
The Branson flight's
not for another 45 minutes.

1300
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,874
I could just meet you down at the gate.

1301
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,212
- OK.
- Everybody together? Got everything?

1302
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,838
- Yeah, let's go.
- I'm comin'.

1303
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,384
Wow, so you're really back with Marnie.

1304
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:36,678
Hey, fellas.

1305
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,223
Hand it over, dumb-ass. No liquids
over three-point-four ounces.

1306
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:45,770
Good call. Hey, pirate,
can you spot me a 20?

1307
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,356
I want to get one of those
scented neck pillows.

1308
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:50,858
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.

1309
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,568
- Here you go.
- Thanks, bro.

1310
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:53,736
Yeah, you got it.

1311
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:56,906
Are you kidding me?

1312
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,534
This might seem crazy,
but he and I actually have

1313
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,203
- a lot in common, so... Oh, fuck!
- Sorry.

1314
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,623
You don't have anything in common
with those people.

1315
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:09,711
Look at me. You OK?

1316
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:16,342
Do you think I really
want to be Branson bound?

1317
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,636
I don't.

1318
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:25,810
The whole time you told me
I wasn't good enough, you were right.

1319
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:30,481
So this is my life. I gotta go.

1320
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:32,567
Marnie's waiting for me.

1321
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,318
- See ya, guys.
- Yeah.

1322
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,154
- See you later, Kirky.
- See you.

1323
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:45,371
What?

1324
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,467
Goddamn it. Tina Jordan.

1325
01:24:58,302 --> 01:24:59,552
Here.

1326
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:09,103
That's a large Coke,
a fry and some ketchup...

1327
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:11,898
- Mary J. Blige!
- Hey, Wendell.

1328
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,692
I need to know, right now,
why it didn't work out with us.

1329
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,612
- I have customers.
- This is important, OK?

1330
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:21,491
This is important. I was good to you,
right? I mean, I was sensitive.

1331
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:24,327
Remember when you got the flu?
I didn't party that weekend.

1332
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:26,370
Remember?
Remember the leg massages?

1333
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,582
Remember when I used to run
my hand down your back? Like that?

1334
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,877
Remember when I nursed
that baby bird to health?

1335
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,463
Little Timothy? He died.

1336
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,925
Christ on a corndog.
Tammy, can you cover for me?

1337
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:41,511
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Tammy.

1338
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,889
Whatever, Wendell. Can I help
the next person in line, please?

1339
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,266
I really liked you,
but all that stuff about

1340
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:49,393
I'm a ten and you're only a six?

1341
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,020
- Seven.
- Fine.

1342
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:54,982
But you were all up in my beeswax
checking to see if I was gonna dump you.

1343
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:59,570
But you did dump me! Why don't you just
admit I was never good enough for you?

1344
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:03,157
Wendell, you were
plenty good enough for me.

1345
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,576
You were just
never good enough for you.

1346
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:08,246
Oh, shit.

1347
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,208
I'm gonna need some
gravy fries when I get back.

1348
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:18,005
Would you put your seat forward, please?

1349
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,716
- Tom fuckin' Wopat, bro. Told you.
- Tray table.

1350
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,595
- Kirky, look at David Archuleta.
- Can I help you?

1351
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:25,763
TSA. Excuse me.

1352
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:28,307
- You have no authority.
- You better believe I do.

1353
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:32,270
All right, everybody, listen up! TSA!
I apologize. This guy's drunk as fuck.

1354
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,605
He shit his pants.
It's very embarrassing.

1355
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:37,483
We have to get him off.
I'll have to have you come with me.

1356
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,862
- Jesus Christ. What are you doin'?
- I was wrong about you and Molly.

1357
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,115
We gotta fix it. Just act drunk.
Thank you. TSA. Come on.

1358
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:46,951
Believe it or not,
this has nothin' to do with you.

1359
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:48,327
- Sir!
- It's not about me.

1360
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,830
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the aircraft.

1361
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:53,457
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit my personal space.

1362
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,085
- Stainer!
- Fuck off! Sorry, that's yours.

1363
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,379
You're gonna get arrested by
the Department of Homeland Security.

1364
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,464
They're gonna send you
to Guantanamo Bay.

1365
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,466
Yeah. I like Cuba. I like mojitos.

1366
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,635
You don't wanna go
to Branson with A-holes!

1367
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:07,179
- He call us A-holes?
- Look at them. That one's pregnant.

1368
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,807
- That guy's got hair in the front.
- Dude...

1369
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:11,767
Sweetheart, remember the baby.

1370
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,186
- I'm doin' this for the baby.
- Don't be a hero!

1371
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,148
- How's this work? Seat belt person!
- Stop. We have a...

1372
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:20,234
They are my family.
And I'm with Marnie now.

1373
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:22,737
Marnie is an evil bitch.
All due respect.

1374
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,196
Kirk! Hit him!

1375
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,991
- At least say something.
- Let's go.

1376
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,994
OK. I was right about Molly.
She's a ten, OK? A hard ten.

1377
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,204
- My God.
- I was wrong about you. You're a ten.

1378
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:33,998
- You can't settle for a three.
- Two.

1379
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,875
- Arguably a two.
- Come on, let's go.

1380
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:38,711
You're the best guy I know. I won't
let you end up with her. You're a ten!

1381
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,796
- Come on.
- Listen! You're a ten!

1382
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,924
You're a ten! Kirk, don't do it!

1383
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,800
I'm not going! I'm not going!

1384
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:47,178
- OK, this is not good.
- All right, I'm going.

1385
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:49,513
Whatever.

1386
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,646
Last call for flight four-four-three.

1387
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:59,315
- Damn it!
- Last call for flight four-four-three.

1388
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:04,362
- Hello?
- Hey, Patty.

1389
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,447
- Who is this?
- Stainer. Don't hang up.

1390
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,115
How the fuck did you get my number?

1391
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,035
- TSA. Moving on...
- No. no. no. Let's not move on.

1392
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:14,789
This better not be where you ask me out
because you confused my hatred for you

1393
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:17,833
for some kind of flirtation.
I thought I made myself clear.

1394
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,877
No, no, no, you were clear. We're good.

1395
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:23,506
- 'Cause I genuinely hate you also.
- Oh, cool.

1396
01:28:23,674 --> 01:28:26,133
Cool. And we're back to talking.

1397
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,553
All right. So, Kirk is leaving
on a plane with another girl.

1398
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,723
Now, I tried to get him off,
but they threw me off the plane!

1399
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,059
Stainer, your screw-up
is not my problem.

1400
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:38,270
No, we both screwed up.
We told them that it wasn't gonna work.

1401
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:41,649
They believed us. So now,
unfortunately, I need your help.

1402
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,863
Hello? Patty? Goddamn it.
you fucking hung up on me!

1403
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:50,574
- OK, I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

1404
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:54,954
Sorry.

1405
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:59,083
I have a ground X-ray one radio check.
Taxi to one-two.

1406
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,920
EastWest four-three. you're cleared
for taxi to runway two-seven.

1407
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:07,216
So, we are seeing the
Dave Coulier tomorrow night,

1408
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:10,094
and on Saturday we're gonna see
both of the Elvis tributes,

1409
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:11,470
- and then on S...
- No.

1410
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:17,768
- Excuse me?
- No, no, no. Stainer was right.

1411
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:20,021
Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.

1412
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,606
- Stainer was right.
- What are you doing? Kirk!

1413
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:26,610
Yeah, I'm not going
to Branson with you people.

1414
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:32,116
You are my family and I love you,
but really, with the exception of Mom,

1415
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,618
you're all a bunch
of bloodsucking vampires

1416
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,579
who never support anything I do.

1417
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:40,833
I'm going to go find Molly
and show her that I am good enough.

1418
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:42,960
So fuck you, Debbie.

1419
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,921
Fuck you, Dylan.
Fuck you, Dad.

1420
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:49,383
Fuck you... businessman. I'm sorry.

1421
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:53,721
And, most of all, fuck you, Marnie.

1422
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:56,140
Yep.

1423
01:29:56,308 --> 01:30:01,479
You never deserved me in the
first place, you evil little dwarf.

1424
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:07,151
So fuck you all! Yep.

1425
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:10,196
Sir. You need to take your seat.
We're pushing back.

1426
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,699
Don't know if you just heard my speech,
but I need to get off this plane.

1427
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:17,787
Well, if I reopen that cabin door,
that's a 25,000 dollar fine for you.

1428
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,747
Twenty-five...?

1429
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,795
What do you want to do?

1430
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,339
Is there another seat I could take?

1431
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,925
We're full. Now,
take your seat and buckle up.

1432
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:32,885
Yep. OK.

1433
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:48,067
Cabin crew, lock doors and cross-check.

1434
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,153
Gonna be a long flight, eh, pirate?

1435
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,288
What's going on?
What's the emergency?

1436
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:04,583
- Molly, how are you doing?
- Fine.

1437
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:07,211
No, I'm actually asking you.
How are you doing?

1438
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:16,387
- You have photo ID, right?
- Well, yeah.

1439
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:18,806
- Where are we going?
- Just buckle up!

1440
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:26,856
We should be on our way shortly,
so just sit back, relax and...

1441
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:37,074
The white zone is for
immediate loading and unloading...

1442
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:39,118
You're gonna tell me what's going on?

1443
01:31:39,286 --> 01:31:42,037
In ten minutes, Kirk is leaving on
a plane for Branson with a horrible,

1444
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,998
- horrible girl.
- Marnie?

1445
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,250
- Yes. Let's go.
- If Kirk's getting back together

1446
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:49,336
- with Marnie, I'm not going!
- In fourth grade, I peed in my pants.

1447
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,631
On several occasions.
Everybody started calling me Stainer.

1448
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:54,675
Know how I made it through
those dark days?

1449
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,760
- Plastic underwear?
- In part.

1450
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:59,346
But also Kirk. You see,
he told me to own that name.

1451
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,849
Call myself Stainer,
so that nobody could hurt me.

1452
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:04,435
- What's your point?
- Kirk's the best guy I know.

1453
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:06,645
But he's like... He's like a spider.

1454
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:09,273
You know? He's more afraid of you
than you are of him.

1455
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,275
And he also, he has long legs and...

1456
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:14,320
Look. If you want him,
you gotta go get him.

1457
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,537
- We're moving. Where is the package?
- It's here.

1458
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:26,874
OK, we couldn't get him off the plane,
so we've gotta get you on.

1459
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:28,334
Oh, thank you, Stainer!

1460
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:32,880
This is so exciting. Yes!

1461
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:37,218
Oh, shit. Follow me.

1462
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,096
- Excuse me!
- Hey!

1463
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:43,265
- Come on!
- Boarding passes and IDs out.

1464
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:45,351
- Let's keep it moving!
- One second.

1465
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,062
Whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?

1466
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:49,772
Putting her on a plane, that's what.

1467
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:53,484
Well, unless she has a
first class ticket, back of the line.

1468
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:58,656
Fuller, you have a choice.
You can step aside or you can fight me.

1469
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:02,660
If that's how you want to go,
I warn you, I will go dark side.

1470
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,955
OK? I will rip out your hair,
I'll bite your chin off,

1471
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,999
and I will stab you in the eyes
with confiscated scissors.

1472
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,960
'Cause I am an insane motherfucker!

1473
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:14,171
You know that from the break room!
What's it gonna be?!

1474
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:19,885
Yes!

1475
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:24,139
Please check your seat belts.
We're preparing for departure.

1476
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:30,646
Branson!

1477
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:34,149
They've gone. We missed it.

1478
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:36,527
No, no, no. No. No, this is not...

1479
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:39,446
This is supposed to happen.
This isn't how this works.

1480
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:43,534
- Yeah? Talk to Jack.
- Stop the plane.

1481
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,203
Dude, done and done.

1482
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:49,540
Yeah, that's how we roll.

1483
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:54,378
Oh, come here, beautiful.
Time to go to work.

1484
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,304
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Captain.

1485
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:07,725
We got some kinda light on up here.
Some kind of mechanical problem.

1486
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,561
Anyway, we're gonna have to deplane.

1487
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:13,981
Oh, man! What's "deplane" mean?

1488
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,234
Come on, Jack. Come on.

1489
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:19,611
Come on, Jack!

1490
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,115
That's it! Yeah. Let's go, let's go.

1491
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,747
Look, Kirk, I do not know
what's gotten into you,

1492
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:33,917
but I just want to say I forgive you
and we are going to go to Branson,

1493
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,045
and we are going to enjoy it!

1494
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,923
OK, you got something
off your chest, and that is fine.

1495
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:43,927
And it's over now. We are gonna
pretend that it never happened.

1496
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:47,014
Why are you walking so fast?

1497
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:50,601
Kirk! We're solid, baby!

1498
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:53,562
We're... Oh, that is it.

1499
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:59,568
- That is it! Motherfucker!
- Excuse me. Sorry.

1500
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:02,780
- Sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- I will catch you, Kirk!

1501
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,239
- No...
- I will catch you!

1502
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,824
- Excuse me.
- I'm faster than you!

1503
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:06,992
Sorry.

1504
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,620
I will catch you if it's
the last thing that I do...

1505
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:22,424
- Who is it?
- It's Kirk. Kirk, where are you?

1506
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,927
Stainer, you were right, buddy.

1507
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:27,596
I just got off the plane.
I'm gonna go find Molly.

1508
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:30,265
That's great, except
we're right here. I'm with Molly.

1509
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:31,433
What?!

1510
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:34,603
We came to find you. We're at the gate!
Turn around. we're here.

1511
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:37,981
All right, I'm comin' to you.
Comin' to you!

1512
01:35:38,608 --> 01:35:42,027
Excuse me! Sorry, sorry!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1513
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,115
Oh, God.

1514
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:52,621
Hey, wait! Cart, wait!

1515
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,249
What the hell?

1516
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,170
- Oh, my God!
- Go!

1517
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:02,172
Hey!

1518
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:03,590
Would you stop it?!

1519
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,681
I think we should see other people!

1520
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,524
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1521
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:23,402
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1522
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,196
- Hey.
- Hey.

1523
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:30,784
- What are you doin' here?
- It was Patty and Stainer's idea.

1524
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:35,038
I just...

1525
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:38,750
I just knew that I had to come find you.

1526
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:42,546
- I nearly...
- Kirk, shut up. Let me speak.

1527
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:44,381
That's a good idea.

1528
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,134
You are out of shape.

1529
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:50,846
- It's true.
- Yeah, I know.

1530
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:52,306
Not what I thought you were gonna say.

1531
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:53,891
You're uncoordinated.

1532
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:56,393
You're not a college graduate,
you've never been to Europe,

1533
01:36:56,561 --> 01:37:00,189
and your car really is a shitbox.

1534
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:03,567
- That's good.
- You were right.

1535
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:09,573
I did ask you out because I thought
you'd be safe and I wouldn't get hurt.

1536
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:13,243
And, yes, I lied to my parents because
I was worried what they'd think.

1537
01:37:14,204 --> 01:37:15,537
I'm sorry.

1538
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:22,044
But I'm here to tell you that
I don't care if you want to be a pilot,

1539
01:37:22,212 --> 01:37:27,257
a TSA agent or shovel
elephant shit at the circus.

1540
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:30,469
Because I missed you.

1541
01:37:30,637 --> 01:37:35,432
And I just want us to be together.

1542
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,895
- Jesus...
- You really having to think about this?

1543
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:41,813
- Shut up, Patty.
- You shut up!

1544
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:47,444
I don't remember what the
specific question was, but...

1545
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:50,948
- I do.
- You do?

1546
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:53,116
- I will.
- You will?

1547
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,826
I missed you.

1548
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:03,961
Guys, this is...

1549
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:08,632
It's a tale as old as time, you know?
Song as old as rhyme.

1550
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:11,009
Think she's still not wearin' underwear?

1551
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:12,636
- Just stop it.
- I heard you.

1552
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:40,247
Seriously. tell me where we're going!

1553
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:42,165
- Nope.
- Why won't you tell me?

1554
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,668
You won't show me the tickets.
I'm gonna find out.

1555
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,504
- Just trust me, OK?
- Oh, you're so annoying!

1556
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,298
Ah, thar she blows!

1557
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,635
OK, that is not nearly big enough.

1558
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,609
What the hell are you doing?

1559
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:11,528
I've been taking a few lessons lately.

1560
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,531
- That's what you've been up to?
- Yep.

1561
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:17,909
I should ask you,
did you pack your bags yourself?

1562
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:19,786
- Yes, I did.
- All right, good.

1563
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:23,206
Everything seems to be in order.
You ever been to San Francisco?

1564
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:26,752
- Yes.
- Good, 'cause we're going to Cleveland.

1565
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:31,006
Pittsburgh tower,
November-five-four-five-Charlie-Papa

1566
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:33,842
requesting takeoff clearance
on runway two-niner.

1567
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:37,971
Five-Charlie-Papa.
you are cleared for takeoff.
