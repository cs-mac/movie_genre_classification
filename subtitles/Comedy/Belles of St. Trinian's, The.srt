1
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,451
This is creepy, Daddy.
Where is everybody?

2
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,995
I'm sure they're all hard at work, darling.

3
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,708
Come on.

4
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,677
This is so unbelievably low rent.

5
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,432
Good afternoon.

6
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,737
We're here to see Miss Fritton.

7
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,656
You're not from Inland Revenue,
are you?

8
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,952
No. I'm er...
Camilla's younger brother.

9
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:40,952
<i>Ooh</i>

10
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,954
You'll have to forgive me.

11
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:47,583
My brain doesn't kick in till Wednesday
when I've been caning it all weekend.

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,168
You know what I mean.

13
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,839
Miss Fritton,
your brother's here to see you.

14
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:55,132
<i>I can't understand
a word you’re saying</i>

15
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,803
<i>I said your brother's here to see you</i>

16
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,479
<i>Carnaby Fritton</i>

17
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,945
<i>No no listen to me very carefully</i>

18
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,447
Why would I buy a picture

19
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,701
from someone of your dubious reputation?

20
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,496
That's what you do, isn't it, Carnaby?

21
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,916
I'll get back to you.

22
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,719
Hello, Camilla.

23
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,598
Mr Darcy, stop that at once.

24
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,517
Go to your happy place.

25
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,187
Carnaby Fritton.

26
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,648
Oh, I haven't heard a word from you
in over 15 years.

27
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,859
I sent flowers.

28
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,903
A wreath...

29
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:58,571
for Mummy's funeral.

30
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,075
Oh, you must be my lully,
lully niece Annabelle.

31
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,162
You're all clear.

32
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,882
Oh.

33
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,177
So... your father's PA

34
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,430
tells me you're joining us from
Cheltenham Ladies' College.

35
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,683
For the life of me, I can't understand
why he sent you there.

36
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,812
Yes, I was an utter fool to be taken in
by the excellent teaching standards

37
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:36,234
and their consistently high performance
in league tables.

38
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,195
In my experience,
the teachers are insufferable snobs,

39
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,530
and the girls are all shits.

40
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,699
Not to worry, my dear.

41
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,286
Here, pupil and teacher live in blissful harmony.

42
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,336
Daddy.

43
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,880
<i>Daddy you can't expect me to stay here</i>

44
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,633
It's like Hogwarts for pikeys.

45
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,886
It's a little rough around the edges, darling.

46
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,889
But that's part of the fun of the place.

47
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:16,065
Here is a breakdown of the school fees.

48
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,072
Whisky?

49
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,034
There seems to be some kind of mistake.

50
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,790
The Bursar never makes mistakes about money,
unless it's for tax purposes.

51
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,293
But what about... a family discount?

52
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,336
Family discount!

53
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,425
You discounted the family years ago,
Carnaby Fritton,

54
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,637
when you ruined Great Aunt Millicent
with your hair-brained schemes.

55
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,098
I've done nothing to feel guilty about.

56
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:56,939
Your father has a short memory
masquerading as a clear conscience.

57
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,941
The fees are 4,000.

58
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,985
1,500.

59
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,070
3,000, take it or leave it.

60
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,114
Let's call it 2,000, cash.

61
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,741
2,500.

62
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,784
- Two and a quarter.
- Two-three.

63
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,828
Two-three, done.

64
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,958
Daddy, you can't leave me here.

65
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,793
Don't be silly, darling.

66
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,837
It'll be half term before you know it.

67
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,881
- Bonne chance!
- Daddy!

68
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,925
Daddy!

69
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,314
Your old man's Roller
looks like it's seen better days.

70
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,774
No.

71
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,401
It's a classic.

72
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,321
Daddy's an expert on the finer things.
He has an art gallery in Mayfair.

73
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,658
I'm Annabelle...

74
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,702
Miss Fritton's niece.

75
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,996
I'll have someone come fetch your bags.

76
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,332
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

77
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,418
Kelly Jones.

78
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,336
I'm head girl.

79
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,797
Really?

80
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,637
Welcome to St Trinian's.

81
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,516
# Oh, My God

82
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,477
# I've never been this far away from home

83
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,147
# And, oh, my God, I can't believe it

84
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,275
# I've never been this far away from home

85
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,153
What are you bogging at... Ugly Betty?

86
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,654
Know where my bed is?

87
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,657
You saying I nicked your bed?
Is that what you're saying?

88
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,034
I'll give you a slap.

89
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,077
Back off, Taylor.

90
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,121
Go paint your nails.

91
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,041
She who angers you conquers you.

92
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,084
Whatever.

93
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,002
Weirdo.

94
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,714
The Chavs are a bit touchy at the moment.

95
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,508
Oi, are you calling me a chav?

96
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,093
So, I told him...

97
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,553
They run a chatline

98
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,473
and all claim to have slept with
a member of the Royal Family.

99
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,477
When you've dropped that many
US bonds in the market, begin trading...

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,895

<i>Talk to the Geeks</i>

102
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,398
What about this lot? Are they asleep?

103
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,196
Goths.

104
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,281
We're not Goths, we're Emos.

105
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,493
What are Emos?

106
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,537
Emotionally unstable.

107
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,539
First years.

108
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,168
<i>Fulchester's answer to The Sopranos</i>

109

<i>What are they betting on?</i>

111

# Did I say nine? I meant 1:30

164
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,839
# I ain't no early birdy,
I'm working the nine to five

165
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,680
Well, I um... Love the new packaging, girls.

166
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,308
But what about the problems
we had with the last batch?

167
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,935
Problems, Flash?

168
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,396
Yeah, the slightly bitter aftertaste,

169
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,691
people going blind after the second glass...

170
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,151
that lady what died...

171
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,487
She was old. She could have gone at any time.

172
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,281
She was 38.

173
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,032
Yeah?

174
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,160
Anoushka. Come here, girl.

175
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,513
- Na zdorovye!
- Abramovich.

176
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,397
Are you all right?

177
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,192
- No problem, Flash.
- We got ourselves a deal, then.

178
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,401
Excellent.

179
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,655
If that's permanent...

180
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,616
I'll see you in court.

181
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,702
Just be aware of that.

182
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:31,621
Ta-da!

183
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,707
Nice. Wow. What have we here?

184
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,251
It looks lovely, anyway.

185
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,545
Like Christmas. What's this, then?

186
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,172
Like, sweets, is it? A cigar?

187
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,341
Hey, look at me.

188
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,135
- They're tampons, Flash.
- What?! Oh!

189
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,764
- Designer tampons.
- Why? Why do you do that?

190
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,476
A woman doesn't only want to look
beautiful on the outside.

191
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,354
I can't sell a product I don't believe in. Come on.

192
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,732
You wanted a word, Flash?

193
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,193
Ooh, yeah. All right, girls.

194
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,403
Yeah, well, carry on.

195
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,030
<i>Keep at it</i>

196
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,491
Yes. Um...

197
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:13,454
I was wondering if you could have
a word with the Maths Department.

198
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,248
What's the problem?

199
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,834
They're very keen to place a bet and that,

200
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,546
but they're not so forthcoming
when it comes to squaring it with the bookie,

201
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,048
if you get my drift.

202
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,844
Teachers.
Keeping them in line is a full-time occupation.

203
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,142
Kell, um...

204
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,104
A new Chinese opened in the high street.

205
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,147
Apparently it's handsome.

206
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,276
I wondered if you weren't too busy,
maybe one night this week.

207
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:48,072
Shoot me down in flames if it's not a good idea,
but I thought we could pop along, the two of us.

208
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,658
- I don't think so, Flash.
- No. Stupid idea.

209
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,702
I don't mix business with pleasure.

210
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,871
And I've got a lot on.

211
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,914
Very busy.

212
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,668
Busy with all my... gear here, so...

213
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,255
# And there's no turning back,
I'm working the nine to five

214
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,923
# Just to keep my contract...

215
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,092
- Nice work on the paint job.
- Night, Flash.

216
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,469
- Auf Wiedersehen, girls.
- See you soon.

217
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,484
<i>Incoming 10 degrees south possible hostile</i>

218
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,863
<i>Intruder located</i>

219
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,740
First years, into position.

220
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,537
<i>Morning Miss</i>

221
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,291
<i>Oh!</i>

222
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,046
But we still need to pay the staff.

223
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,048
Otherwise they'll go out on strike.

224
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,925
Not now, Bursar.

225
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,430
Miss Fritton, if we don't take
a firm grasp of this situation,

226
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,557
then St Trinian's will have to...

227
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,809
Not now.

228
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,981
Some dosser's just pitched up.

229
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,987
<i>She claims she's our new English teacher
She doesn't look like it</i>

230
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,073
She looks like she hasn't got a pot to piss in.

231
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,617
<i>- Beverly
- Sorry, Miss Fritton.</i>

232
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,456
She doesn't look like she's got a pot
in which to piss.

233
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,209
<i>That's better</i>

234
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,297
Ah, Miss Fritton,
my references and qualifications.

235
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,258
Oh, my dear, how lovely.

236
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,511
That you made it down the drive
is qualification enough.

237
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,555
I daresay you'll do very well.

238
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:39,433
The agency tells me you've lost
four English teachers in six months.

239
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,602
Very careless of us.

240
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,980
I expect they'll turn up.

241
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,023
Moorcroft! Tuck that shirt in!

242
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,109
Sorry, Miss.

243
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,085
<i>Muy bien chicas</i>

244
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,008
How do you feel, girls?

245
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,969
- Much better, Miss.
- Anger management. Carry on.

246
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,769
No. No, no, no. You will get paid.

247
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,522
I promise.

248
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,859
Everyone...

249
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:37,491
I'd like to introduce you to
our new English teacher. Miss Dickinson.

250
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,285
Hello.

251
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,914
Welcome.

252
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,459
You must try my latest concoction.
It's a real beauty.

253
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,462
- I call it The Gerald.
- The Gerald.

254
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,214
After my first husband.

255
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,549
Cheap, bitter and completely alcoholic.

256
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,678
- Have you been drinking again?
- No. no.

257
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,097
Just a little breathless.

258
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,975
Go on. I'm dying to know what you think.

259
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,269
I... I'm teetotal, I'm afraid.

260
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,444
But I do like having fun
as much as the next person.

261
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:19,158
In fact, I'd love it if we could all
get involved in School Challenge.

262
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,911
TV quiz show.

263
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,580
Popular at my last school

264
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,416
and tremendous fun
for both pupils and teachers.

265
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,052
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning, Mr Thwaites.

266
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,345
Please, sit.

267
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,014
Now, as you know all too well,

268
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,142
our nation's schools have been blighted
by the false kindness

269
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,187
of namby-pamby, touchy-feely policies
for far too long.

270
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,440
Badly behaved children don't need
an arm around the shoulder.

271
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,735
They need a good kick up the arse.

272
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,822
May we say "shot in the arm," sir?
For the tabloids?

273
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:02,243
Say what you need to say.
The important thing is what we do.

274
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:06,289
I intend to start with the worst schools
in the country.

275
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,333
But that would mean St Trinian's, sir.

276
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,214
- What's the matter with him?
- Five years ago he went to...

277
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,300
that place undercover.

278
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,095
He's suffered severe
and recurrent trauma ever since.

279
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,140
Really? From a bunch of naughty schoolgirls?

280
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,476
You wouldn't know, man. You weren't there.

281
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,312
<i>When I overhauled the prison service</i>

282
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:34,483
I began by tackling the most fractious,
lawless and feared institutions around.

283
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,987
Once I'd dealt with those,
the others simply fell into place.

284
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,407
We'll take the same approach with St Trinian's.

285
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,660
Be afraid, sir. Be very afraid.

286
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,543
Right. On my command, unleash hell.

287
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,829
- Daddy!
- Hello, darling.

288
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,957
Daddy, look!

289
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,209
They're bloody animals.

290
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,254
Animals! I'm going to kill them!

291
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:40,007
Try to remember
what your behavioural therapist said. Run along.

292
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,886
We've entered bedlam. The very gates of hell.

293
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,181
I don't understand
why you didn't close this place years ago.

294
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,976
Because, Miss Bagstock,
they can change. And they will.

295
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:55,314
Not this lot. You'd understand
if you met their headmistress.

296
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,943
Between you and I,
she's worse than the children.

297
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,112
A Miss Fritton.

298
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,196
Camilla.

299
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,242
# Love Is A Many Splendoured Thing

300
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,248
<i>That's right Completely barking mad
Have you heard of her?</i>

301
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,667
Ah, Miss Bagstock.

302
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,045
Your girlish laughter
hit me like the lash of a hunting crop.

303
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:22,466
Miss Fritton, I don't expect you've met
our new Minister of Education.

304
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:28,848
# Love is a many splendoured thing

305
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,226
- Geoffrey.
- Miss Fritton.

306
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,859
- So you have met?
- University.

307
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,236
We were the toast of the dramatic society.

308
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,280
Oh, Geoffrey.

309
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,699
Another time...

310
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,576
Another Country.

311
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,245
<i>To what do I owe the pleasure?</i>

312
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,666
I've heard that your school is a hotbed
of anarchy, ill-discipline...

313
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,709
Oh.

314
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,420
...and your academic results are a disaster.

315
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:02,173
- So I'm here to help.
- How lovely.

316
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:06,093
I've got some shelves that need putting up
and the kitchens need a good scrub.

317
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:09,138
Unsanitary catering facilities.
I'll add that to the list.

318
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,894
You know, I think you'll find
you and I both want the same things.

319
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,772
We just happen to be sitting on
different sides of the table.

320
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,691
Table? Mortuary slab, I'd say, Geoffrey.

321
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,778
You want to straitjacket us
with your limited curriculum,

322
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,949
which has become nothing more than
state-circulated Chinese whispers

323
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,284
and you call it education.

324
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,870
You've changed, Geoffrey.

325
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,873
You haven't.

326
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,426
I think Mr Darcy likes you.

327
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,349
Let it dry, and then a good stiff brush.

328
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:03,192
Oh, my God. It's Verity Thwaites.
She's a total psycho.

329
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,529
<i>Come on Cheltenham Ladies
Show them what you’re made of</i>

330
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,365
The important thing is not to provoke her.

331
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,952
Who let the dogs out?
Who? Who? Who-who?

332
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,621
Who let the dogs out? Who? Who? Who-who?

333
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,500
Who let the dogs out? Who? Who? Who-who?

334
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,003
So, what do you think of my girls?

335
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,505
- Hawes!
- I beg your pardon?

336
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,842
Jemma Hawes, pull your socks up.
You're a Cheltenham Lady.

337
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,762
I'm sure your girls will try their very best.

338
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:35,683
But It's not the winning that matters.
It's the taking part that counts.

339
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,144
Snooty cow.

340
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,645
Sorry?

341
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,523
Emily Snooty-Cow, do remember to stretch.

342
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,154
Jolly good. Jolly good.

343
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,823
Girls!

344
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,867
Look who it is.

345
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,664
It's Annabelle the Cannibal.

346
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,920
What's that all about?

347
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,130
I used to eat people.

348
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,757
What?

349
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:13,888
I used to have braces
and bits of food got stuck in them.

350
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,682
Nice.

351
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,161
OK, girls, let's play clean.

352
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,372
No biting, scratching, kicking.

353
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,832
No gouging.

354
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,793
<i>No head butting no punching</i>

355
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,838
No slapping, spitting. No um...

356
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,883
No gouging.

357
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:35,136
And um... no non -regulation equipment.

358
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,180
Janey, I'm talking to you.

359
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,727
OK, into position.

360
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,063
Come on, girls, let's take them down.

361
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,947
Ooh!

362
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,991
On you go, Matron.

363
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,534
Right you are.

364
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,328
You do know the rules, don't you?

365
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,913
Nope.

366
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:02,955
Oh.

367
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:15,009
- Good shot!
- Yes!

368
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,302
Yes!

369
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,882
- Barbed wire?
- Check.

370
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,425
- Crowbar?
- Check.

371
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:38,885
- Wheel clamp.
- Check.

372
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,262
<i>- Follow the tools girls
- Wait for me.</i>

373
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,139
<i>Hurry up slow coach</i>

374
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,189
- He didn't?
- He did!

375
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,316
It was just so disgusting.

376
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,819
It was still quite funny.

377
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,863
But then I said to him, "You didn't?"

378
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,741
And he said, "I did. "

379
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,994
- He didn't?
- He did. Just imagine!

380
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,047
Posh Totty.

381
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:18,674
Hello, big boy.

382
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,052
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Shoo.

383
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,642
I'm wearing my school uniform, silly.

384
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,687
Although, I'm about to get changed
into my gym kit.

385
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,192
<i>I did really well in my last oral</i>

386
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,196
<i>Although I did find it a bit of a mouthful at first</i>

387
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,325
<i>But Miss says if I practice as often as I can</i>

388
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,661
<i>I could become Head Girl.</i>

389
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,457
We're onto you, so watch your backs!

390
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,459
Feel the fear. We're maniacs!

391
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:54,919
St Trinian's!

392
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,299
M- A-N -I-A-C. St Trinian's!

393
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,384
Look out.

394
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:07,932
Don't Give Up

395
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,560
# If I tried to tell you to do what for?

396
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,064
# Can't you see life's knocking right at your door

397
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:19,277
# I just don't know for sure

398
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,616
# Don't give up, don't give up

399
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,910
# Don't give up, don't give up

400
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,745
# Don't give up, don't give up

401
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,373
# Don't give up, don't give up!

402
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,634
Does anybody have any smelling salts?

403
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,261
No, but I've got poppers.

404
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,264
Go, girlie! Go, girlie!

405
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,060
# Can't you see life's knocking right at your door

406
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:57,064
Fair play.

407
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,068
# What if I tried to tell you to do what for

408
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:03,112
# Don't give up, don't give up

409
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,615
# Don't give up, don't give up

410
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,034
# Don't give up, don't give up

411
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:10,536
# Don't give up, don't give up!

412
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,961
Girlie, girlie, girlie! Ha-ha!

413
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,673
<i>I know it's very hard Charles</i>

414
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,842
<i>and most of the girls hate it</i>

415
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:28,137
<i>but I really like Greek</i>

416
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,975
<i>Charles? Charles?</i>

417
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,437
<i>Are you there?</i>

418
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,527
<i>What's that?</i>

419
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,278
<i>Is that yours?</i>

420
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,083
You wouldn't know the way to
the hockey pitch, would you?

421
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,669
Wargh!

422
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,845
Short corner to St Trinian's.

423
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:20,898
Go!

424
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,363
You're dead.

425
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:36,998
Yes!

426
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:40,209
# Are teenage dreams so hard to beat?

427
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,713
# Every time he walks down the street

428
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,883
# Another boy in my neighbourhood

429
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:50,428
# Wish he was mine, he looks so good

430
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:53,848
# I want to hold him, want to hold him tight

431
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:57,685
# I get teenage kicks right through the night

432
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:00,104
Geoffrey, where on earth have you been?

433
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:03,149
You're running quite an exotic
establishment here, Miss Fritton.

434
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,319
- What a lovely thing to say.
- What have they done to you?

435
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,073
I quite agree. The best team did win.

436
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:14,368
I suppose the lesson is,
don't mess with St Trinian's.

437
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,287
We do play a little rough.

438
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,706
We can all play rough, Camilla.

439
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,501
Maybe we'll be seeing a little more
of one another.

440
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,544
I'll make sure of it.

441
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,508
# I want to hold him, want to hold him tight

442
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,886
# Get teenage kicks right through the night

443
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,596
# All right!

444
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:17,932
Ah!

445
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,523
Beverly. Beverly.

446
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,487
Ow!

447
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:36,534
Beverly, would you like to offer
this gentleman something to drink?

448
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,369
Sorry, how rude of me.

449
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm... I'm afraid after last night
we've only got Smirnoff.

450
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,836
- Tea, Beverly.
- Or tea.

451
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,755
Yeah, sorry. Tea, tea, tea...

452
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,176
We're not here to drink tea, Miss Fritton.

453
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,596
You owe the bank over ?00,000.

454
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,975
Aren't you lucky?
Christmas bonuses all round, I expect.

455
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,979
Because of your decision to ignore
our six previous final demands,

456
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:09,150
I am forced to serve you with this
foreclosure notice.

457
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:14,322
<i>Final demand? How can there be
more than one final demand?</i>

458
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,908
<i>Which is the final, final demand?</i>

459
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:19,327
I can't believe you haven't told me about this.

460
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,996
Well, actually, I did try to tell you.

461
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,749
Not now, Bursar. Beverly, where's that tea?

462
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:29,587
You can't just pull the plug on us,
like some underperforming hairdressing salon.

463
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,549
This is an institution of learning, sir,
and I have a duty of care.

464
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:36,177
I don't answer to you, I answer to my girls.

465
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,262
Girls who find shelter in no other schools.

466
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:41,057
A bunch of delinquents
and playground terrorists.

467
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:47,396
One man's terrorist
is another woman's freedom fighter, Mr...

468
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,608
...Bank Manager.

469
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:55,446
You have four weeks to repay
the outstanding balance...

470
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,615
or this school...

471
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,659
is declared officially bankrupt.

472
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,625
Tea.

473
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,419
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble

474
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:13,798
# Something's come along
and it's burst our bubble...

475
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,050
Houston, we have a problem.

476
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:21,472
# Gotta make a dash
for the cash on the double

477
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,029
# The party was great, yeah

478
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,489
# We were really thrilled

479
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:42,368
# But the bank man came
and we're gonna get killed

480
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,329
# We got some style but we got no money

481
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:47,915
# Now the joke's on us...

482
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,876
Quiet, everyone!

483
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:58,718
St Trinian's is closing down.

484
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:11,355
We're facing the biggest crisis of our lives
and you're behaving like bloody children.

485
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:16,444
If this place closes down,
we have to go to other schools,

486
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:19,697
<i>and by that I mean normal schools.</i>

487
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:24,869
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble

488
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:28,247
# We're deep in doo-doo
and we don't have a shovel...

489
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,084
Thank you, Matron.

490
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:34,879
Mm... Oh...

491
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:40,134
A dark cloud hangs over the school, Beverly.

492
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,303
I know all about that one, Miss Fritton.

493
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:45,765
Sits on top of me every Monday
when I'm on a comedown.

494
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:47,767
Do you know what you've got to do?

495
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,811
You gotta get your serotonin levels
back in whack.

496
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:55,191
Red ones bring you up
and blue ones bring you down.

497
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:58,486
I believe in a healthy balance.
I'll have one of each.

498
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:00,321
Thank you.

499
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,782
Mm. Delicious.

500
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:15,336
- Oh, darling!
- Daddy! I'll get my stuff and we'll go.

501
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,755
- What?
- That's why you're here, isn't it?

502
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,552
No, we'll... talk later, darling. Milla.

503
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,436
Oi.

504
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,148
You might wanna see this.

505
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:41,279
A boutique hotel?
But this is my school, Carnaby.

506
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:44,490
The bank's school, Camilla.
And when they shut you down,

507
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:47,743
you will have lost everything -
and more importantly, so will I.

508
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,916
<i>The good news is I’ve a pal property</i>

509
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,668
<i>Oh Milla do listen</i>

510
00:38:56,419 --> 00:39:00,298
<i>I think I’ve come up with a solution
that could benefit us both</i>

511
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:03,551
If we move fast, sell the place now,

512
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:08,097
we can repay the debt and er... split the profits.

513
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,434
Looks like your old man's
selling us down the river.

514
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,145
No. Daddy wouldn't do anything like that.

515
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,813
<i>What about the girls?</i>

516
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:17,857
What would happen to my dear girls?

517
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:22,320
You can stop the Miss Jean Brodie act,
now, Milla. It's me you're talking to.

518
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:27,366
<i>- What about Annabelle?
- I don't know what to make of that girl</i>

519
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,202
<i>A bit of a drip if you ask me</i>

520
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,538
<i>I sometimes wonder if she's actually mine</i>

521
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,666
Still a daddy's girl, eh?

522
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,627
<i>You’re wrong about her Carnaby</i>

523
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,587
<i>In there there's a Fritton</i>

524
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,841
<i>She's got the true family stripe
which is more than I can say about you</i>

525
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:47,011
<i>- You snake in the grass
- Let's face it little sister</i>

526
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,388
<i>This dump is history</i>

527
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,683
<i>- Oh</i>

528
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,852
It's no use relying on the grown -ups.

529
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,897
We need to sort this out ourselves.

530
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:09,408
Now, the subject of today's lesson is crime.

531
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,661
Yeah? All right? You're liking me now.

532
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:15,039
<i>So for every need there is a misdeed</i>

533
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:17,875
And what our need is,
in this particular instance, girls,

534
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,961
is to get our hands on half a bar.

535
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:22,463
<i>That's half a million pounds for you little ladies</i>

536
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:25,216
<i>Any ideas? Who's got an idea?</i>

537
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:26,717
Anyone? Yes?

538
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,386
Shut up! You!

539
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:32,265
- What about extortion?
- Excellent. Well done.

540
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:33,891
Yes.

541
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:36,853
<i>Brilliant Extortion</i>

542
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,481
Now, I know a lot of people think
the old, "Give me your money or else,"

543
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:45,069
is a bit old hat, but it's a classic,
it's perennial, possible.

544
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:48,197
<i>Good work Now who else has got any ideas?</i>

545
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,658
- Go on, Celia.
- Confidence trickery.

546
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,119
Confidence trickery. Excellent!

547
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:55,496
<i>- Credit card fraud.
- Credit card fraud</i>

548
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,249
- Kidnapping, Flash.
- Kidnapping!

549
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:01,961
That is more like it. Kid... napping!

550
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:05,506
So, we take a rich man's wife...

551
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,675
- Excellent.
... cut off her ear...

552
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:09,886
and then send it to him special delivery.

553
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:15,766
And then... we just keep chopping...

554
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:19,187
...bits of her off...

555
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,147
...until he pays the ransom.

556
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:27,403
You shouldn't be laughing at that.
That is too much evil.

557
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,198
You should see a counsellor.
Don't leave her on her own.

558
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:39,707
Come in, don't loiter in the doorway.

559
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,675
I didn't know you painted, Auntie.

560
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:51,802
Miss.

561
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:54,555
Just having a little bit of "me" time.

562
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:58,726
Once upon a time
I used to think of it as a career.

563
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,480
It's jolly good. Did you sell many paintings?

564
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:06,025
Not under my own name.

565
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,948
I took it up when I was recovering
from a broken heart.

566
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,742
We Fritton women are made of sturdy stuff

567
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:18,162
but we do need an emotional outlet,
don't we, dear?

568
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:20,206
Hit me. Come on, girlie, hit me!

569
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,166
Come on, come on.

570
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,168
- Come on, girlie, girlie!
- I can't!

571
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:26,170
You can. Let out your frustrations.

572
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:29,966
Inhale your anger
and let it all out with a good right hook.

573
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,467
Go on.

574
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:34,428
I see.

575
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:40,351
Turn your mind to something or someone
who really makes your blood boil. Hm?

576
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:43,604
A snake in the grass
who betrays his family ties

577
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:45,857
as easily as he betrays his word.

578
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:49,861
An unconscionable shit.
A complete and utter...

579
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,914
Oh...

580
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,251
Welcome to the fold, girlie.

581
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:10,339
Help your old auntie up.

582
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:12,550
Rah!

583
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:15,344
Oh, poor girl.
Let's have a whisky.

584
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:20,057
Come on, ladies, we need to think big.
Open your minds real wide.

585
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:25,605
You gotta search
for the criminal inside yourself. Yes!

586
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:29,609
Theft.

587
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:32,528
Theft. Finally. Now you're talking.

588
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:34,238
<i>Excellent Theft</i>

589
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:36,449
- Good work.
- Bank of England?

590
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:38,242
Bank of England too big.

591
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:40,828
- Woolworth¡¦s.
- Too small. Just sweets.

592
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:43,915
Come on, think about it. I'm telling you...

593
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:47,752
If you don't use your noggins,
we ain't gonna get this dough together.

594
00:43:49,337 --> 00:43:52,381
I see erm... Yes... Kelly.

595
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:54,467
What about that?

596
00:43:57,428 --> 00:43:59,180
Oh, my God!

597
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:03,100
You want to steal Scarlett Johansson?

598
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,144
You are so blonde, Chelsea.

599
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:09,065
That is one of the most
valuable paintings in the world.

600
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:12,360
And it is here now.

601
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:15,822
We steal it and then we fence it.

602
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:19,325
You'd be able to flog it for us, Flash,
wouldn't you?

603
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:24,664
Well, erm...

604
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:29,085
It's probably a bit out of my league, Kel.

605
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:32,839
Number 7.

606
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:37,093
The Heist.

607
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:44,600
Girls, it's time we organized a school trip.

608
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,904
Girls, please. Remember we have
the school's reputation to uphold.

609
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:00,092
Oi.

610
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:02,678
Bingo.

611
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:07,517
Wow.

612
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:10,645
You can so see why
Colin Firth wanted to shag her.

613
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:15,399
Yeah, but you could spruce it up with
a dash of colour and some accessories.

614
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:21,280
I'm thinking, lose the earrings
and go for some big gold hoops.

615
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:26,786
Ciao-ciao.

616
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:28,246
- So?
- OK.

617
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:31,791
They've got 28 CCTV cameras
on separate circuits.

618
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:36,546
Four shifts of 12 armed guards
patrol the galleries 24 hours a day.

619
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:38,798
Pressure alarms, invisible random lasers,

620
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,551
and hydraulically-operated
reinforced steel shutters.

621
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:42,844
Golly!

622
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:45,513
- So?
- We're talking Mission: Impossible.

623
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:48,516
- That's a no?
- If Tom Cruise can do it, so can we.

624
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,145
Yeah, yeah, but the real problem is,
how do we get into the building?

625
00:46:54,605 --> 00:46:56,649
<i>We need some kind of cover</i>

626
00:46:57,358 --> 00:46:59,443
Any bright ideas?

627
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:06,033
So, are we good?

628
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:09,912
It's such a pity none of you want to give
School Challenge a shot.

629
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:12,373
It would be so much fun.

630
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:16,878
I only mention it because
the final takes place right here.

631
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:20,339
What did you say?
- The final will be televised here.

632
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:23,885
In the Grand Hall.

633
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,683
The location: Trafalgar Square.

634
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,187
The target: National Gallery.

635
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,063
This is where our trailer base is.

636
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:39,150
- And the distance?
- 114 metres.

637
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:41,694
OK, let's get animated.

638
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:48,367
<i>So here we are -
one of the world's busiest squares</i>

639
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:51,078
<i>And Big Brother will definitely be watching us</i>

640
00:47:51,162 --> 00:47:53,331
<i>with a surveillance camera on every wall</i>

641
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:55,625
<i>and security guards at every turn</i>

642
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,836
<i>So we use the trailer as cover
and take the sewers</i>

643
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,634
<i>- Nasty.
- Who's that?</i>

644
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,596
- Ha-ha! Taylor.
- What?

645
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,098
Why me?

646
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:13,851
I don't know what you're looking
so pleased about, Andrea.

647
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,895
<i>- You're coming as well.
- Shut up!</i>

648
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:18,356
Me and the Corpse Bride? I don't think so.

649
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:20,191
Drop the attitude, Taylor.

650
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:22,193
<i>- Polly
- Now...</i>

651
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:26,072
When you get in the sewers,
you have to get through these iron gates.

652
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:31,702
Eugh!

653
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,712
We have double chemistry tomorrow.

654
00:48:41,796 --> 00:48:44,215
We'll start on the explosives.
- Good work.

655
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:47,844
Once inside, you'll make your way
through to the balcony,

656
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:49,428
which overlooks the Grand Hall.

657
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:52,640
Then you take the zip wire over the audience,

658
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:54,684
while the show is being recorded.

659
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:00,398
It's like 10 metres high.

660
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:02,441
<i>113 actually</i>

661
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:07,238
So after we've got through the rank sewers,
iron gates, security guards...

662
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:10,700
And then we've done a live wire act
over the audience,

663
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:14,162
I suppose you want us to swim
the Channel, and then...

664
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:16,581
- climb a mountain...
... as well!

665
00:49:16,664 --> 00:49:19,167
No. You just have to get through these.

666
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:25,590
Invisible random lasers

667
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:29,635
with pressure alarms that trigger
hydraulically-operated steel shutters.

668
00:49:34,223 --> 00:49:36,517
All sounds frightfully exciting, doesn't it?

669
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:38,436
As for the explosives, girls,

670
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:40,771
I'd go for RD X rather than Trinitrotoluene.

671
00:49:40,855 --> 00:49:43,524
There's nothing worse than rogue C-4.

672
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:44,901
Yes, Miss.

673
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:48,404
<i>But all this will be a complete waste of time
unless we get to the Final</i>

674
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,281
Oh, God, yeah.

675
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:54,160
So, girls... how do you plan to get us there?

676
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:58,915
That's not a problem.

677
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:02,001
<i>Get yourself on camera
and the world can be your oyster</i>

678
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:05,463
One day you're on School Challenge,
the next it's Love Island.

679
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:08,257
Soon you've married a footballer
and bought the Bahamas.

680
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:14,639
But easy, now, girls,
because if you don't take that moment,

681
00:50:14,722 --> 00:50:17,058
blink... and it's back to obscurity.

682
00:50:18,017 --> 00:50:19,977
Oi, girls. Jog on.

683
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:25,024
- So who...
- JJ French.

684
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:28,486
Our last Head Girl, now turned PR guru.

685
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:30,988
People want soap opera.

686
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:34,325
They want to know how to get your look.
What diet you're on.

687
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:36,744
They want to know all about your broken hearts

688
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,579
and your fashion disasters.

689
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:42,333
But keep them talking, that's the game.

690
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,377
That's genius.

691
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:47,713
Then why isn't everybody famous?

692
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,925
Because they don't have me.

693
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:55,179
You need to play an angle.

694
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:58,307
Look at Liz Hurley.
She wore that dress and what happened?

695
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:00,351
An acting career, her own clothing line

696
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:03,020
and a 15-page wedding in Hello! magazine.

697
00:51:03,104 --> 00:51:04,438
<i>Now that's genius.</i>

698
00:51:07,024 --> 00:51:10,486
OK, so here's a little tip I learned from Paris.

699
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,780
- Hilton?
- France.

700
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:20,079
Put on a pair of YSL's and the whole world
will think you're a total brainiac.

701
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:35,011
You are welcome to join us
on our quizzical quest

702
00:51:35,094 --> 00:51:38,181
to find the brightest of sparks,
the smartest of alecks,

703
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:40,766
the very pluperfect of pupils

704
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:45,062
in this year's battle to find
the champions of School Challenge.

705
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:54,071
<i>On my right in the red corner
we have Ampleforth College</i>

706
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:59,327
<i>And on my left in the blue corner
it's Peaches Chelsea and Chloe</i>

707
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,872
from St Trinian's!

708
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:06,959
What term is applied to a restraint
on the expansion of an economy

709
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:09,754
<i>as a result of governmental taxation policy</i>

710
00:52:09,837 --> 00:52:13,132
<i>whereby a rise in inflation
causes a larger proportion</i>

711
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:16,260
<i>of wage earners' income to be paid in tax?</i>

712
00:52:18,262 --> 00:52:19,972
Chelsea, St Trinian's.

713
00:52:20,056 --> 00:52:21,307
Fiscal drag.

714
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:24,143
Fiscal drag is the right answer.

715
00:52:24,227 --> 00:52:26,020
Well done. Five points.

716
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:30,566
Which Roman poet...

717
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,610
Peaches, St Trinian's.

718
00:52:32,693 --> 00:52:34,111
Ovid.

719
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:36,239
Ovid is the answer I have on the card.

720
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,991
Who wrote...

721
00:52:40,034 --> 00:52:42,286
Charles Dickens.

722
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:45,122
...is the right answer. Well, I'm sorry, Ampleforth,

723
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:48,167
you're up against a team
at the very top of their form.

724
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:50,711
Quickly.

725
00:52:57,552 --> 00:53:00,096
<i>Which Tchaikovsky overture</i>

726
00:53:01,138 --> 00:53:02,014
1812.

727
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:03,349
Is the correct answer.

728
00:53:03,432 --> 00:53:05,726
<i>There goes the school bell</i>

729
00:53:05,852 --> 00:53:07,395
<i>with the scores standing at</i>

730
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:11,399
...which means, I'm sorry to say,
Ampleforth College,

731
00:53:11,482 --> 00:53:13,484
we have to bid farewell to you.

732
00:53:13,568 --> 00:53:16,279
Loser! Loser!

733
00:53:16,362 --> 00:53:17,864
<i>Loser!</i>

734
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:20,950
So...

735
00:53:21,075 --> 00:53:23,411
how are we going to beat Bedales?

736
00:53:25,997 --> 00:53:27,623
<i>Magic</i>

737
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,294
The kind you get in mushrooms.

738
00:53:34,213 --> 00:53:36,048
<i>- Hi
- Hi.</i>

739
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:38,301
<i>Anyone for camomile tea?</i>

740
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:40,344
- Yes.
- Thanks.

741
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:50,897
In which Shakespeare play would you
find the following stage directions:

742
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,192
"Exit, pursued by a bear"?

743
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,362
Yes. Chas. Bedales.

744
00:53:58,446 --> 00:54:01,699
Was it Winnie the Pooh?

745
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:04,702
Caspar...

746
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:09,999
- Are you buzzing, Caspar?
- Oh, yeah.

747
00:54:10,124 --> 00:54:11,709
<i>You've had your chance</i>

748
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:14,337
You've buzzed... What are you doing?

749
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,714
What are you doing? Chas! I'm being touched.

750
00:54:16,797 --> 00:54:18,925
Derek, I'm being touched. Derek!

751
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:27,308
Sure, just sign the deal
and I'll make sure she says the brand live on air.

752
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:29,685
<i>- Apple
- Apple is the right answer</i>

753
00:54:30,728 --> 00:54:33,981
<i>Know-it - all nymphets from St Trinian's</i>

754
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:38,820
Oh, come on, Eton.
I'm going to have to hurry you.

755
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:40,905
No, it's gone.

756
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:43,950
And so has the bell!

757
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:48,412
And er... on that note, I'm afraid we leave Eton...

758
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:53,918
...and congratulate our glorious
and glamorous victresses,

759
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:55,044
<i>who will go on next week</i>

760
00:54:55,169 --> 00:54:58,172
<i>to the grand final to meet
Cheltenham Ladies' College</i>

761
00:54:58,256 --> 00:54:59,966
<i>It is of course St Trinian's</i>

762
00:55:08,307 --> 00:55:10,476
Are we going to close down St Trinian's?

763
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:14,272
<i>No they're more use to us alive</i>

764
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:19,610
You see, as things stand,
they're the perfect symbol of misguided youth.

765
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:22,572
They're a beacon of ill-discipline
in need of correction.

766
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:25,867
I'm going to make an example of them.
I'll break their spirit.

767
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,369
They will conform.

768
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:30,830
It's time the world saw
what we've been dealing with.

769
00:55:30,913 --> 00:55:33,457
Show them the problem... then fix it.

770
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:37,420
The press pack is panting, Peter.

771
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:40,089
It's time we let them loose.

772
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:03,779
Hang on.

773
00:56:03,863 --> 00:56:06,449
You want me, a man of my calibre...

774
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:10,661
...just to... bowl into some gallery in London,

775
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,498
waltz up to your old man

776
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:16,000
and offer to flog him a Vermeer for half a bar?

777
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:18,669
It won't be you. It will be this guy.

778
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:23,007
Gerhard Von Strubel,
the most elusive art dealer in the world.

779
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:27,011
You want me to pretend to be some...

780
00:56:27,094 --> 00:56:28,846
art bloke?

781
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,473
They've never met,

782
00:56:30,598 --> 00:56:33,309
but my father would do anything
to do business with him.

783
00:56:33,392 --> 00:56:35,686
No, I'm sorry, I don't fancy it. No.

784
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:37,188
<i>What's wrong?</i>

785
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:39,232
Not up to it, Flash?

786
00:56:39,315 --> 00:56:41,275
I told you, Annabelle.

787
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,903
Hold on, hold on.
I didn't say I wouldn't do it.

788
00:56:43,986 --> 00:56:47,240
Come on, give us a look at it.
I'll give anything a try once.

789
00:56:47,323 --> 00:56:49,283
So, erm...

790
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:52,203
What's he like, then, this von Strubel mug?

791
00:56:53,037 --> 00:56:55,122
- He's a count.
- He sounds like one!

792
00:56:56,415 --> 00:56:59,168
No, he's posh. I can do posh, look.

793
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:02,171
Oh, la-di-dah! Shall we go hunting?

794
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:04,382
But can you do German?

795
00:57:04,465 --> 00:57:07,260
Yeah, of course I can. Ah, mon freuer...

796
00:57:07,343 --> 00:57:10,221
<i>Strindberg Wiederkind Jürgen Klinsmann</i>

797
00:57:10,304 --> 00:57:13,766
It'll be all right on the night.
Just give me a little bit of time.

798
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,893
What's he erm... What's he look like?

799
00:57:17,478 --> 00:57:20,314
Well, all I've heard is that he's successful...

800
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:22,358
erudite and handsome.

801
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:27,947
Oh, I almost forgot. He's also very, very gay.

802
00:57:32,743 --> 00:57:35,496
Scramble! Black Eagle, one o'clock!

803
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:47,925
Ready to make the front pages, Minister?

804
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:50,887
Peter, the only things
the public wants to read about

805
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,930
are mayhem, misery and disaster.

806
00:57:54,223 --> 00:57:56,184
So we'll be fine.

807
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,812
Thank you for coming, gentlemen, ladies.

808
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:02,940
What you're about to witness
is the disgraceful result

809
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:05,193
of 15 years of political indifference.

810
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:08,821
Schools like this one are weeds.

811
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:12,617
Long neglected, they've been
allowed to grow wild and unruly.

812
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,703
- And you're the weedkiller, Minister?
- I like it, Denise.

813
00:58:15,786 --> 00:58:17,371
Code Red!

814
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:20,082
<i>Code Red!</i>

815
00:58:23,419 --> 00:58:25,671
People have often criticised my methods.

816
00:58:25,755 --> 00:58:28,549
They say I'm too aggressive,
hard-line, whatever.

817
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,261
But what I'm about to show you...

818
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:35,473
...is the appalling alternative.

819
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:37,850
It looks rather pleasant, if you ask me.

820
00:58:44,106 --> 00:58:46,984
You were only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off.

821
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:51,781
Minister! Minister?

822
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:55,451
Code Red!

823
00:58:59,747 --> 00:59:01,707
Morning.

824
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:05,127
Er... are you lot from Inland Revenue?

825
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:07,171
No.

826
00:59:08,256 --> 00:59:09,465
Phew!

827
00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:10,967
Quickly, quickly.

828
00:59:15,346 --> 00:59:17,139
Ready?

829
00:59:42,665 --> 00:59:46,502
...when the sixth hour was come,
there was a darkness over...

830
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:49,839
How can I help you?

831
00:59:55,094 --> 00:59:59,557
<i>And some of them stood by
when they heard the saint</i>

832
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,144
They're bound to slip up sooner or later.

833
01:00:13,029 --> 01:00:14,989
Christ! He's coming this way!

834
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,993
We're never gonna make it!

835
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:29,629
Who are you?

836
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:32,465
I know your daughter.

837
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:34,634
You're friends with Verity?

838
01:00:34,717 --> 01:00:36,677
I was at Cheltenham with her.

839
01:00:37,386 --> 01:00:40,681
She was the school bully
and I was one of her favourite victims.

840
01:00:40,806 --> 01:00:42,058
<i>Really?</i>

841
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:45,436
<i>So Minister your daughter was the school bully</i>

842
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:49,982
And what's it like being at St Trinian's?

843
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:52,026
Oh, it's like...

844
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:57,782
one big, happy...
if slightly dysfunctional... family.

845
01:00:57,865 --> 01:01:00,034
<i>A bastard profanes the English throne</i>

846
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:03,788
The generous Britons are cheated by a juggler.

847
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:06,874
<i>Geoffrey What a surprise!</i>

848
01:01:11,671 --> 01:01:13,422
What's going on, Miss Fritton?

849
01:01:13,506 --> 01:01:15,466
The girls are hard at work,

850
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:18,553
and their headmistress
is rehearsing the role of a lifetime.

851
01:01:18,636 --> 01:01:21,180
Don't you think I make a remarkable queen?

852
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:24,350
You're up to something,
and I will get to the bottom of it.

853
01:01:24,433 --> 01:01:25,852
I will expose you.

854
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:28,646
Well, you'll have to at least
buy me dinner first.

855
01:01:28,729 --> 01:01:30,690
Oh, Geoffrey.

856
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:34,235
Oh, not again.

857
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,908
Aar-rooo!

858
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:52,461
Not quite the headline we had in mind, Minister.

859
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:40,593
You've had this coming
since the day you arrived, Fritton.

860
01:02:40,676 --> 01:02:42,595
What are you going to do to me?

861
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:50,228
Give you a makeover, silly.

862
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:52,647
3 Spoons Of Suga

863
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:08,329
# She likes to dress
like she's fresh out of a magazine

864
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:15,962
# She struts around
getting down to her record machine

865
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:22,844
# It's clear that she enjoys teasing all the boys

866
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:26,347
# They always say
that you'll remember her name

867
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:28,391
# Because she's got it

868
01:03:29,725 --> 01:03:31,686
# She's got it right down

869
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,438
# And all the guys say

870
01:03:34,522 --> 01:03:37,400
# I need three spoons of sugar

871
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:39,277
# To get over you

872
01:03:41,237 --> 01:03:45,199
# I'm gonna need a whole lot of therapy
to cure the sugar rush

873
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:47,243
# I can't get over you

874
01:03:49,662 --> 01:03:51,205
# Gimme something in my coffee

875
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:53,040
# Gimme thrills, take my money

876
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:55,084
# Can't get over you

877
01:03:55,835 --> 01:03:57,503
So... how do you feel?

878
01:03:59,213 --> 01:04:00,756
Like a St Trinian.

879
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,510
# I need three spoons of sugar
in a glass full of liquor

01:04:08,514 --> 01:04:10,475
# Gimme something in my coffee

01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:12,310
# Gimme thrills, take my money

883
01:04:12,393 --> 01:04:14,395
# Can't get over you

884
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,775
# I'm gonna need a whole lot of therapy

885
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:21,903
# I can't get over you

886
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,243
Ah, Lavinia.

887
01:04:29,327 --> 01:04:32,288
Are you tempted by our caped crusader?

888
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:38,586
Gah! Why is it that the first face I see

889
01:04:38,669 --> 01:04:41,506
is not only the handsomest face in this room

890
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:44,759
but also the very face I came here to talk to?

891
01:04:44,842 --> 01:04:46,427
It must be fate.

892
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:47,470
You are?

893
01:04:47,553 --> 01:04:49,096
German.

894
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,098
Whereabouts in Germany?

895
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:53,267
Bayern Munich.

896
01:04:53,976 --> 01:04:55,728
That's a football team.

897
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:59,273
Yes... and I am their number one fan.

898
01:05:00,691 --> 01:05:02,902
Please, don't go. I didn't mean to offend you.

899
01:05:02,985 --> 01:05:06,697
It's just... I get very lonely being German.

900
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:10,451
And a bigwig in the art world.

901
01:05:10,535 --> 01:05:12,245
- I imagine.
- And gay.

902
01:05:12,995 --> 01:05:14,372
- Would you...
- Ohh!

903
01:05:14,497 --> 01:05:17,708
Whoopsie-daisy! Gerhard, Gerhard, Gerhard!

904
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:19,335
Oh, my God.

905
01:05:21,337 --> 01:05:24,090
You're not Count Gerhard von...

906
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:26,133
Sshh, please!

907
01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:28,803
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

908
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:36,978
One of the great masterpieces has just
become available on the black market.

909
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:43,860
Which masterpiece are you talking about?

910
01:05:43,943 --> 01:05:46,028
Well, it's actually rather a big deal.

911
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:48,739
A little out of your league, perhaps.

912
01:05:48,823 --> 01:05:50,783
Perhaps it's something you'd er...

913
01:05:50,867 --> 01:05:52,493
prefer to discuss over dinner.

914
01:05:54,036 --> 01:05:54,954
What?

915
01:05:55,037 --> 01:05:57,540
Well, you said how... Lonely you are.

916
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:01,919
We could er... spend some time together.

917
01:06:03,004 --> 01:06:04,964
A nice candlelit dinner,

918
01:06:05,047 --> 01:06:07,341
a stroll along the beach...

919
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,178
...just the two of us...

920
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,014
...barefoot in the surf.

921
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:16,642
And then...

922
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,687
...back to my place.

923
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:26,944
Or I could just... tell you now.

924
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:29,363
- Oh, yes, OK.
- Good, it's better.

925
01:06:30,448 --> 01:06:32,200
The masterpiece is the...

926
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:36,120
The Girl With The Pearl Earring.

927
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:38,831
Really?

928
01:07:34,011 --> 01:07:36,055
The ultimate price was paid by one...

929
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:39,058
...who laid down his life...

930
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:41,477
for his sisters and his school.

931
01:07:43,813 --> 01:07:46,482
No greater love hath any dog...

932
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,652
...than this.

933
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:00,121
I'm sorry.

934
01:08:00,913 --> 01:08:02,874
This one's for Mr Darcy!

935
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:07,044
On My Way To Satisfaction

936
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:11,966
# Hey, yeah, yeah

937
01:08:12,758 --> 01:08:15,761
# Don't you know I saved a spot for you?

938
01:08:17,013 --> 01:08:19,474
# And I-I-I

939
01:08:19,974 --> 01:08:23,060
# I wanna introduce you to my crew

940
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:25,104
# So what do you say?

941
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:27,648
# Am I gonna get my way?

942
01:08:29,692 --> 01:08:31,652
# I don't need your permission

943
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,906
# You're uptight and it don't look right

944
01:08:36,699 --> 01:08:38,659
# You've gotta share my vision

945
01:08:39,911 --> 01:08:41,871

# Your reaction

954
01:09:15,822 --> 01:09:17,365

<i>A little embarrassing for your department

No, Denise, I wouldn't.

958
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,170
I'm here in a private capacity
to support my daughter's school.

No more photos now, please, gentlemen.

960
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,174
One question.

961
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:42,140
Excuse, can I just...

962
01:09:42,223 --> 01:09:44,016
I'm sorry, you can't go in there.

963

What? But I...

964
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:48,437
The team's going through

Tania, what are you doing?

968
01:10:23,556 --> 01:10:25,224
You're 10.

969
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:27,393
And you're carrying high explosives.

970
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:29,437
It's not what you think, Kell.

971
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,314
It's for the smell.

972
01:10:31,397 --> 01:10:33,357
We saw it on CSI.

973
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:34,692
Oh.

Who was burned at the stake for
the crime of wearing men's clothes?

989

Peaches. St Trinian's.

Joan of Arc.

991

Joe Nafark.

992
01:12:43,905 --> 01:12:47,366
Joan of Arc is the right answer.
Five points to St Trinian's.

993

What are you doing here?

998
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:47,802
We got stuck in the toilet.

999
01:13:48,886 --> 01:13:52,598
We thought our mummy
would come and get us but nobody did.

1000
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:54,642
We were scared.

1001
01:13:54,725 --> 01:13:56,686
You're safe now. Come on.

1002

Come on.

Um...

1010
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:36,934
Habeas corpus.

1011
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:40,688
Habeas corpus is the right answer.
They are on fire, Cheltenham.

That was more painful than a Brazilian wax.

Yes, Peaches. You got there first.

01:21:53,412 --> 01:21:55,373
OK. Well done.

1115
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:58,709
<i>I don't know who St Trinian was</i>

1116
01:21:58,793 --> 01:22:00,545
<i>but he was watching over you then</i>

1117
01:22:00,628 --> 01:22:02,755
<i>Congratulations you’re back on form</i>

1118
01:22:05,633 --> 01:22:07,677
<i>So fingers back on buzzers please</i>

1119
01:22:18,604 --> 01:22:20,439
<i>- hello?
hello will do</i>

1120
01:22:20,523 --> 01:22:23,776
We've got a problem.

1121
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,862
Thwaites is onto us.

1122
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:27,530
Buggeration!

1123
01:22:27,613 --> 01:22:30,199
What is the capital of Burkina Faso?

1124
01:22:30,616 --> 01:22:32,535
<i>Yes?</i>

1125
01:22:32,618 --> 01:22:33,953
<i>Chloe</i>

1126
01:22:34,036 --> 01:22:34,912
Ouagadougou.

1127
01:22:34,996 --> 01:22:37,456
Ouagadougou is the right answer.

1128
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:40,710
Well done, Chloe. Congratulations.

1129
01:22:40,793 --> 01:22:42,920
I had a boyfriend from there.

1130
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:48,426
<i>Another five points to St Trinian's
This is getting exciting</i>

1131
01:22:49,802 --> 01:22:51,762
Geoffrey!

1132
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:58,186
You know, when I was in the prison system,

1133
01:22:58,269 --> 01:23:00,563
I encountered some of the country's top felons,

1134
01:23:00,646 --> 01:23:04,025
but your girls really are in a whole other league.

1135
01:23:04,108 --> 01:23:06,235
They are the crème de la crème.

1136
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:08,029
What did I tell you?

1137
01:23:08,821 --> 01:23:11,574
Don't tell me. Tell it to the judge.

1138
01:23:11,657 --> 01:23:14,952
Oh, I've met some hard-boiled men in my time,

1139
01:23:15,036 --> 01:23:18,247
but... you are 20 minutes.

1140
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:21,501
One last drink... for old times' sake?

1141
01:23:22,668 --> 01:23:24,629
I don't think so.

1142
01:23:25,379 --> 01:23:27,340
Geoffrey, where did it all go wrong?

1143
01:23:29,509 --> 01:23:31,552
You and I...

1144
01:23:31,636 --> 01:23:33,805
Where did it go wrong?

1145
01:23:34,847 --> 01:23:40,728
Was I... too fickle, too... fanciful?

1146
01:23:40,812 --> 01:23:43,731
Too... much for you?

1147
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,361
Maybe I will have that drink.

1148
01:23:51,405 --> 01:23:53,366
Down here!

1149
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:58,746
Wait for me.

1150
01:24:13,803 --> 01:24:15,763
Let's dance.

1151
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:21,227
# A new dawn waits for us tonight

1152
01:24:24,021 --> 01:24:26,566
# If you play the cards...
- Come on, focus!

1153
01:24:31,612 --> 01:24:36,701
# I swear I'll keep in party line

1154
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:44,542
# Cross my heart and hope to die

1155
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,798
# If I lose myself to rhythm

1156
01:24:50,882 --> 01:24:54,093
# Doesn't mean I lose control

1157
01:24:54,177 --> 01:24:58,014
# If I can't dance then I don't want

1158
01:24:58,097 --> 01:25:01,809
# Any part of your revolution

1159
01:25:01,893 --> 01:25:03,603
# Revolution

1160
01:25:03,895 --> 01:25:05,855
# Revolution

1161
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:09,150
You've put me in a very difficult position, Milla.

1162
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:14,947
Whereas on the one hand,
it's my sovereign duty to...

1163
01:25:15,072 --> 01:25:17,450
to turn you in. On. Over.

1164
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:25,124
On the other hand, the second hand. Ticktock.

1165
01:25:28,169 --> 01:25:30,129
You're so...

1166
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:33,341
- So...
- Intelligent?

1167
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,970
Fragrant?

1168
01:25:39,388 --> 01:25:41,724
- Dangerous?
- Odd.

1169
01:25:41,808 --> 01:25:43,476
I mean, you always have been.

1170
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:58,866
Cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river.

1171
01:26:09,335 --> 01:26:11,420
Everyone, we have lift-off!

1172
01:26:18,803 --> 01:26:22,515
I'm sorry, Camilla,
but as you well know, I am a hard...

1173
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:26,185
I'm a hard...

1174
01:26:26,769 --> 01:26:29,313
What am I?... liner.

1175
01:26:30,064 --> 01:26:32,942
I'm a hardliner,
which means I'm hard and a liner.

1176
01:26:36,487 --> 01:26:38,531
Had a dog called Linus once.

1177
01:26:41,659 --> 01:26:42,994
Linus!

1178
01:26:43,077 --> 01:26:44,537
Here, boy.

1179
01:26:45,246 --> 01:26:47,206
<i>Linus! Here boy!</i>

1180
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:49,792
<i>Linus!</i>

1181
01:26:49,876 --> 01:26:51,836
I thought the world of that dog.

1182
01:26:53,254 --> 01:26:55,214
I loved that dog.

1183
01:26:57,216 --> 01:26:59,177
Camilla.

1184
01:27:00,094 --> 01:27:02,054
What I'm trying to tell you...

1185
01:27:03,723 --> 01:27:06,058
...is that you...

1186
01:27:06,184 --> 01:27:08,144
you remind me of Linus.

1187
01:27:15,818 --> 01:27:16,986
Woof, woof.

1188
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:25,495
Three minutes till the end of the show.

1189
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:27,955
<i>You've gotta get back pronto</i>

1190
01:27:37,465 --> 01:27:39,217
What are you doing?

1191
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,260
I couldn't stay there on my own.

1192
01:27:53,022 --> 01:27:55,525
...in Greek mythology, of Hercules...

1193
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:57,610
- OK, don't panic.
- Panic?

1194
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:05,493
<i>You can do it - you’re nearly there</i>

1195
01:28:13,501 --> 01:28:16,879
And I know now
that it's time for the final question.

1196
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:18,548
And looking at the scores...

1197
01:28:18,673 --> 01:28:21,050
<i>- Kelly listen to me
- What am I meant to do?</i>

1198
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:23,594
Get back now. Right now.

1199
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:25,555
<i>Or we're history</i>

1200
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:30,810
. 140 points. For the first time
in School Challenge we have a tie

1201
01:28:30,893 --> 01:28:32,520
<i>as we go into the final question</i>

1202
01:28:32,603 --> 01:28:36,899
All the sweating, all the heartache,
all the dreams, the hopes, ambitions,

1203
01:28:36,983 --> 01:28:38,693
<i>the revising the swotting</i>

1204
01:28:38,776 --> 01:28:42,280
it's all come down to this moment.

1205
01:28:46,868 --> 01:28:50,121
I'm sorry. It's a side effect
of my raisin and Ryvita diet.

1206
01:28:50,204 --> 01:28:53,666
Contrary to popular opinion, better in than out.

1207
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,752
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

1208
01:28:56,836 --> 01:28:59,505
the final question - the decider.

1209
01:29:00,339 --> 01:29:04,969
Fingers on buzzers.
Which substance is believed to have

1210
01:29:05,052 --> 01:29:08,014
<i>such strong aphrodisiac properties</i>

1211
01:29:08,097 --> 01:29:11,142
that the Aztecs forbad women

1212
01:29:11,225 --> 01:29:13,019
from consuming it.

1213
01:29:13,102 --> 01:29:15,062
Thwaites Junior is onto us.

1214
01:29:15,563 --> 01:29:18,191
<i>She'll blow the whole thing -
we've got to stop her</i>

1215
01:29:19,734 --> 01:29:21,611
- I'll handle this.
- But, Annabelle...

1216
01:29:21,736 --> 01:29:23,738
- Annabelle.
- She's mine.

1217
01:29:23,821 --> 01:29:25,406
<i>Annabelle come in!</i>

1218
01:29:30,244 --> 01:29:32,205
Chelsea, St Trinian's.

1219
01:29:36,209 --> 01:29:37,877
Thwaites.

1220
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,923
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to bring you down, Fritton.

1221
01:29:43,132 --> 01:29:45,718
You and your vulgar little school.

1222
01:29:48,262 --> 01:29:51,390
I have to hurry you, Chelsea.
If you buzz you must answer straightaway.

1223
01:29:57,146 --> 01:29:58,397
Is it chocolate?

1224
01:30:07,281 --> 01:30:09,242
You do know I'm faster than you.

1225
01:30:12,703 --> 01:30:14,664
<i>Annabelle? Annabelle come in</i>

1226
01:30:16,165 --> 01:30:17,917
<i>Annabelle</i>

1227
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:20,670
Urgh!

1228
01:30:22,046 --> 01:30:23,923
Chocolate? Is that your answer?

1229
01:30:24,006 --> 01:30:25,967
Er...

1230
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:31,264
Yes, it is.

1231
01:30:36,894 --> 01:30:38,688
Time for a little prayer.

1232
01:30:44,443 --> 01:30:46,654
Is the right answer!

1233
01:30:46,737 --> 01:30:48,406
Yes!

1234
01:30:48,489 --> 01:30:51,409
Which means this year's champions
are St Trinian's School.

1235
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,800
I'm so happy.

1236
01:31:11,846 --> 01:31:14,474
Yes! Yes!

1237
01:31:15,224 --> 01:31:17,643
Yes, Bursar!

1238
01:31:23,065 --> 01:31:25,026
Yeah!

1239
01:31:48,508 --> 01:31:50,635
Camilla, erm...

1240
01:31:50,718 --> 01:31:53,262
Last night, what happened?
I don't remember anything.

1241
01:31:53,346 --> 01:31:55,681
I'm sorry, Geoffrey.

1242
01:31:57,558 --> 01:31:59,727
I'm afraid I had to slip you a little something.

1243
01:32:03,981 --> 01:32:06,067
And then...

1244
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:07,944
you returned the favour.

1245
01:32:09,904 --> 01:32:11,280
Oh, God, you didn't, did you?

1246
01:32:11,364 --> 01:32:14,534
<i>Well not exactly</i>

1247
01:32:14,617 --> 01:32:18,162
- Now, listen, Camilla, I can't...
- Oh, shut up, Geoffrey.

1248
01:32:18,246 --> 01:32:20,206
Just kiss me.

1249
01:32:23,209 --> 01:32:25,878
Love Is A Many Splendoured Thing

1250
01:32:27,004 --> 01:32:36,889
# Love is a many splendoured thing

1251
01:32:38,015 --> 01:32:48,818
# It's the April rose
that only grows in the early spring

1252
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:54,490
What the?

1253
01:33:09,797 --> 01:33:11,716
What took you so long?

1254
01:33:11,799 --> 01:33:13,968
More now on that breaking news story.

1255
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:16,137
In an extraordinary turn of events,

1256
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:20,183
the priceless painting that was stolen
last night from the National Gallery

1257
01:33:20,266 --> 01:33:22,101
has been recovered.

1258
01:33:22,185 --> 01:33:24,145
Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring

1259
01:33:24,228 --> 01:33:28,399
was found by a group of schoolgirls
in a changing room of Harvey Nichols.

1260
01:33:29,275 --> 01:33:32,069
We can go live now to St Trinian's School

1261
01:33:32,153 --> 01:33:34,155
where our reporter Denise Stephenson

1262
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:36,824
is with the chairman of the National Gallery

1263
01:33:36,908 --> 01:33:38,910
waiting to give the girls a reward.

1264
01:33:38,993 --> 01:33:41,162
It gives me great pleasure to present this award

1265
01:33:41,245 --> 01:33:42,663
to the girls of St Trinian's

1266
01:33:42,788 --> 01:33:46,417
who are model citizens,
an example to young people everywhere.

1267
01:33:46,501 --> 01:33:48,461
And here they are now.

1268
01:33:51,255 --> 01:33:53,299
How does it feel to be a role model?

1269
01:33:53,382 --> 01:33:57,470
We've been unable to contact
Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites...

1270
01:33:57,595 --> 01:33:59,430
- There he is!
- He's up there.

1271
01:33:59,514 --> 01:34:01,599
Come on, Minister.

1272
01:34:13,444 --> 01:34:16,614
# We can't fake the way we feel

1273
01:34:16,697 --> 01:34:19,617
