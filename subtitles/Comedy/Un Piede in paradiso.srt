1
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,880
Yes, Salvatore.
Salvatore De Vita.

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,320
What do you mean
you don't know him?

3
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,920
Yes, that's it.
l'm his mother.

4
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,360
l'm calling from Sicily,
the whole blessed day.

5
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,640
l see, not there.

6
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,320
Then please, can you tell me--

7
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,120
656-220-56.

8
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,080
Thank you. Good-bye.

9
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,040
Mama, it's useless to call.

10
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,840
He's a busy man,
could be anywhere.

11
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,960
He won't remember anymore.

12
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,200
Come on, let it go.

13
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,080
He hasn't been here in 30 years.

14
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,760
You know how he is.

15
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
He'll remember.

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,040
l'm sure he'll remember.
l know him better than you.

17
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,720
lf he finds out later
we didn't tell him, he'll be angry.

18
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,480
l'd like to talk
to Mr. Salvatore De Vita.

19
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,920
l'm his mother.

20
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,200
Salvatore...

21
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,280
what time is it?

22
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Very late.

23
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,760
l'm sorry. There was no way
to let you know.

24
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
Go back to sleep.

25
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,120
Your mother called.

26
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,200
She took me for someone else.

27
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,120
What'd you tell her?

28
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,280
l played along.
l didn't want to disappoint her.

29
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,240
We had a long talk.

30
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,640
She said you haven't
visited her in 30 years.

31
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,720
When she wants to see you,
she comes to Rome.

32
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,360
She called just to say that?

33
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
No.

34
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,440
She said someone's died--
someone named Alfredo.

35
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,560
The funeral is tomorrow.

36
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
Who is he, a relative?

37
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,320
No. Go to sleep.

38
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,960
The boy will be my death.
How can l say Mass?

39
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,240
Lord God, we ask you to be pleased with the sacrifice 
we offer you with humble and contrite heart.

40
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,640
Cleanse...

41
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
Cleanse...

42
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,920
Toto!

43
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,760
Cleanse me from my sin.

44
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,920
Better late than never.

45
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,360
How often must l say it?
Without the bell, l lose my place.

46
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,520
Always sleeping.
What do you do at night, eat?

47
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,760
Father, at my house
we don't even eat at noon.

48
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,160
The veterinarian says so.
That's why l'm tired.

49
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,920
l know why you're tired.
Don't think l don't.

50
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,280
Now run along home.
l've something to do.

51
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
- Can l come?
- No, you cannot.

52
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,040
- Yes, yes!
- Toto, out!

53
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,200
l want to! l want to!

54
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,280
Alfredo.

55
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,360
Alfredo!

56
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,760
Yes!

57
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
You can start.

58
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
Here we go again.

59
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,720
The frame!

60
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,320
Pepe, one day we'll have it all.

61
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,800
We'll go away together--

62
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,800
live the easy life...

63
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,240
where no one knows us.

64
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,400
Forget it.

65
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,200
You don't love me anymore.

66
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Never!

67
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,800
One pair, two pairs!

68
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,680
100 lire! Real nylon!

69
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,920
You mustn't come here.

70
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,000
l told you and told you--
like talking to a wall.

71
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,320
lf the film catches fire...

72
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,320
little as you are,
you'll go up-- boom!

73
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,320
''And turn into a chunk of charcoal.''

74
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,680
Like to wag your tongue, eh?

75
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,800
One day, l'll cut it off.

76
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,160
Like that.

77
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,160
Can l have it?

78
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,560
Come on, can l have it?

79
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,040
- Well, can l?
- No!

80
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
Deaf as a post!

81
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,240
l have to splice it back
before l return the film.

82
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,800
What a pest you are!

83
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,440
Why didn't you splice these
when you gave the films back?

84
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,600
Sometimes l can't find
the right place, so they stay here.

85
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,000
Anyway, they kiss too much.

86
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
Then l can have them.

87
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,800
No. Now look, come here.

88
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,840
Before l kick your fanny,
l'll make you a deal.

89
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,720
All those are yours--
a present.

90
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,120
Thanks.

91
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,400
But one, you keep out of here,
and two, they stay with me. Got it?

92
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,720
All right.

93
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,360
Right. Then we agree.
Now scram.

94
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,000
What kind of a deal is that?

95
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,680
lf they're mine,
how come you keep them?

96
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,080
Don't come back,
or l'll thrash you!

97
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,440
''Shoot first, think later.''

98
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,560
''This is no job for weaklings,
traitorous dog.''

99
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,080
''Hey, you! Dirty swine,
hands off that gold!''

100
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,080
''Blackhearted pig,
stay away from me...

101
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,520
or l'll smash your face in.''

102
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,120
Mama, the war's over, but...
why doesn't Papa come back?

103
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,560
He'll come back, you'll see.
One of these days.

104
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,400
l don't remember him.

105
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,880
Where's Russia?

106
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,360
lt takes years to get there
and years to come back.

107
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,480
Go to bed. lt's late.

108
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,080
You can hoodwink your mother,
but not me!

109
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,000
Get your diploma
and join the police! Lazybones!

110
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,640
Good-for-nothing!
Get in there and study!

111
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,160
Well?
How much is 5 times 5?

112
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,240
30.

113
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,840
Silence!

114
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
Table of 5's, dimwit.

115
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,440
1 times 5 is 5...

116
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,240
2 times 5 is 10...

117
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,720
3 times 5 is 15...

118
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
4 times 5 is 20...

119
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,320
5 times 5?

120
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,760
40.

121
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Silence!

122
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,160
Boccia...

123
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,200
25.

124
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,760
Learn your tables,
or you'll never get a job.

125
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,760
For the last time...

126
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,680
what is 5 times 5?

127
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,600
Christmas!

128
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,720
l paid to get in.
l'm seeing the movie.

129
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,240
Get down from there, you devil.

130
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,160
Go back to your seat.

131
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Worse than rabbits.
They're all over the place.

132
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
Little monsters.

133
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,680
l'm off to Oregon.

134
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,720
Wait for me at my ranch.

135
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,880
Wait for a dead man?

136
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,480
A star-studded cast...

137
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
featuring John Wayne...

138
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,360
Claire Trevor--

139
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,680
Hello, everyone!

140
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,400
- Can't l say hello?
- Double feature today.

141
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,400
So? l'm here to sleep.

142
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,280
- What's your smoke?
- Americans.

143
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,480
Cut the news, Alfredo!

144
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,720
The men and women
who fought in secret--

145
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,720
brave guerrillas,
reunited in Rome...

146
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,920
for the first Resistance Rally.

147
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,580
What does it say?

148
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,740
l'm illiterate.

149
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,940
You, too?

150
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,380
Twelve hours of blood and sweat...

151
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,540
to bring home barely enough
to keep from starving.

152
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,900
Yet their nets...

153
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,220
when they pulled them up,
were full.

154
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,300
l knew it!

155
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,900
Twenty years l've gone to movies
and never saw a kiss.

156
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,980
And when will we?

157
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,780
Kiss my ass!

158
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,660
- Don Vincenzo.
- You and you, to work.

159
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,620
What about me?

160
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,260
Go get a job from Stalin.

161
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,700
His day will come, even here.
You watch.

162
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,420
l always get left out.

163
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,780
Good movie.
The kid really acted well.

164
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,540
Too bad he was so unlucky.

165
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,580
What a jackass to buy that boat.

166
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,140
ldiot, you didn't get it at all.

167
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,020
Right, boys,
you work from dawn to dusk.

168
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,980
And don't ask how much it pays.

169
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,020
Mama.

170
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,180
l waited all day.
You got milk?

171
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:35,940
No.

172
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,980
The money?

173
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,300
Stolen.

174
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,060
You spent it on movies?

175
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,740
Movies, always movies!

176
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,500
Signora Maria, wait.

177
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,060
Leave him alone. Go easy.

178
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,260
And you,
why do you tell lies?

179
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,180
You know you got in free.

180
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,060
Tell your mother.

181
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,420
Maybe he lost the money inside.

182
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,860
- How much?
- 50 lire.

183
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,740
What'd you find tonight,
under the seats?

184
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,820
A comb.

185
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,140
Two shoe lifts.

186
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,740
- Can of tobacco--
- And?

187
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,540
50 lire.

188
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,340
See?

189
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,660
Thank you, Alfredo.

190
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,820
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

191
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,300
See you.

192
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,220
l understood right away.

193
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,140
The square is mine!
lt's my square!

194
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,140
lt's midnight. Midnight!

195
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,060
Out! Shoo!
l have to close the square.

196
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,500
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

197
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,820
Going, it's all downhill
and all the saints help out.

198
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,220
But coming back,
the saints just watch.

199
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,300
lf that's God's will.

200
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,380
See you tonight.

201
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,140
What's wrong?

202
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,700
Your foot this time.

203
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,100
Always something.
What can we do?

204
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,900
Alfredo,
did you know my father?

205
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,660
What a question.
And how l knew him.

206
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,300
Tall, thin, jolly,
with a nice moustache like me.

207
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,860
Always smiling.
A lot like Clark Gable.

208
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,660
Now that l'm older
and go to fifth grade...

209
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,700
l don't say l should
come in the booth...

210
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,900
but can't we
at least be friends?

211
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,740
''l choose my friends for looks,
my enemies for intelligence.''

212
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,940
You're too foxy to be my friend.

213
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,700
l always tell my children...

214
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,900
''Be careful how you
choose your friends.''

215
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,540
You haven't got any children.

216
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,660
When l do, l'll tell them.

217
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,460
Don't cry, don't cry.
lt's all right.

218
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,220
The fire's out.
lt's over. l'm here.

219
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,940
What happened?

220
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,980
Monster!

221
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,740
Your little sister
could've burned to death.

222
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,140
And all your fault!

223
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,060
l told you not to keep your film
under the bed by the fire pan.

224
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,100
Even the photographs burned!

225
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,340
Nearly set fire to the house.

226
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,220
You and your stupid movies!

227
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,300
Aren't you ashamed at your age
to play with a boy?

228
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,740
Why look at me?
What did l do?

229
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,620
Who gave him the film?

230
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,580
Don't do it again.
He goes crazy. Crazy!

231
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,340
All l hear is movies, Alfredo.

232
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,740
Alfredo, movies!

233
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,620
Swear you won't let him in again.
Swear it!

234
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,820
You have my word.

235
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,420
God grant me this.

236
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,940
Send your father home
to whip you!

237
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,780
Papa won't come back,
and l know why.

238
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,220
He's dead.

239
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,700
That's not true.

240
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,180
You'll see, he'll come back.

241
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,540
They smoke like chimneys.

242
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,500
No. Go buy a ticket.

243
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,580
No!

244
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,580
What was that?

245
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,060
l'll make mincemeat of you!
You'll reckon with me!

246
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,940
Signora Anna!

247
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
Alfredo.

248
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,660
Don't blame me. Your wife
told me to bring your lunch.

249
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,940
l told my mother
you didn't give me the film.

250
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,260
lt wasn't your fault.

251
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,060
l thought it was a joke
about film catching fire.

252
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,060
l just wanted to tell you.
Now l'll go.

253
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,420
Toto, come here.

254
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,780
Come on, come sit down.

255
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,460
Now listen. l got into
this business at age ten.

256
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,140
Back then, we didn't have
fancy machines.

257
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,980
Movies were silent.

258
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,500
You turned the projector by hand...

259
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,060
with a crank.

260
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,100
The whole livelong day!

261
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,820
And it was hard,
that damn crank.

262
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,660
lf you got tired
and slowed down a bit...

263
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,460
like a shot, whoom,
everything burned.

264
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,700
So why not teach me?

265
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,740
Now that there's no crank
and it's dead easy.

266
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Because l don't want to.

267
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,300
lt's no kind ofjob for you.

268
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,540
You're like a slave...

269
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,540
and always alone.

270
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,940
You see a film 100 times.
You've nothing else to do.

271
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,900
You talk to Garbo and Tyrone Power
like a loonybird.

272
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,900
You work like a burro.

273
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,780
Even holidays--
Easter, Christmas.

274
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,380
You only get Good Friday off.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,860
And if they hadn't
stuck Christ on a cross...

276
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,300
we'd even work then.

277
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,060
So why don't you change jobs?

278
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,660
Because l'm a nitwit.

279
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,300
Who else around here
could run a projector?

280
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,860
Nobody. lt takes
an imbecile like me.

281
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,500
And l never had any luck.

282
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,700
So! Want to be a stick-in-the-mud
like me? How about it?

283
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,860
Attaboy, Toto.

284
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,060
l only tell you
for your own good.

285
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,380
Cooped up here. Suffocate in summer,
freeze to death in winter.

286
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,540
Breathing fumes.

287
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,580
And you earn chicken feed.

288
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,420
Don't you like
anything about it?

289
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,340
Oh, it grows on you.

290
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,220
Sometimes you listen...

291
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,500
and the house is full of people...

292
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,700
giggling and laughing.

293
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,060
Then you're happy too.

294
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,820
lt makes you feel good
to hear them.

295
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,420
Like you're the one
who made them laugh--

296
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,660
who made them forget
their troubles.

297
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,420
That part l like.

298
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,300
l might as well speak Greek!
What're you up to?

299
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,900
Pretend to listen,
then play the clown!

300
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,140
Your mother's right!
You're a scatterbrain!

301
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,420
How'd the rascal do it?
He learned by watching.

302
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,940
l'm telling the manager
not to let you in!

303
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:11,580
And l'll see Father Adelfio!
No more altar boy! Finished!

304
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,500
Alfredo!

305
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,900
Up yours!

306
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,740
l got it! l won!
l won the football lottery!

307
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,300
The Neapolitan won the lottery!

308
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,620
Hey, Ciccio from Naples
won the lottery!

309
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,540
Always the northerners
who hit it lucky.

310
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,060
The square is mine! All mine!

311
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,620
Hold still!
Horseflies bothering you?

312
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,060
You got a lice factory up here.

313
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,740
Beat it.

314
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,260
What're you after? A smack?

315
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,100
Get out of here.

316
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,620
A merchant owns two stores.

317
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,540
ln one, he sells fruit.

318
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,980
Be seated.

319
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,420
Professor...

320
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,900
the auditors taking the exam
for the grade school diploma.

321
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,420
Silence!

322
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,500
Rotten little stinker.

323
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,660
- Toto, help me.
- Silence!

324
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,420
l can't do this damn thing.

325
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,900
Toto!

326
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,180
O.K.

327
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,820
Francesco Messana...

328
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,860
you're under arrest.

329
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,820
Good riddance!

330
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,900
Kiss my ass!
Pencil pusher!

331
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,820
Right here is where
it can catch fire.

332
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,740
lf it does, cut here and here,
or the whole reel will burn. Got it?

333
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,020
Yes. Alfredo.

334
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,700
Never. We'll never
have that here.

335
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,180
Which side is the gelatin on?

336
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,140
lt tastes good.

337
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,580
Shipping invoice for the film.
Always keep them.

338
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,340
l will, Alfredo.

339
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,220
Don't ever forget.

340
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,940
This is for you.
Today you load the reels yourself.

341
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,060
- lt's so high!
- Now you can run it alone.

342
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,340
Hold it.

343
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,940
- What a build!
- My turn!

344
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,740
Say good-bye to Peppino.
He's leaving for Germany.

345
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,780
Why don't you say good-bye?

346
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,180
My father says he's a communist.

347
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,100
God keep you, Mama.

348
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,420
Will he really find work
in Germany?

349
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,500
You never know.
Like playing the lottery...

350
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,420
you live on hope.

351
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,700
Screw this country!

352
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,020
Go work in Germany,
you and your Stalin.

353
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,900
Good-bye, Mama.

354
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,540
Good-bye, Peppino!
Come back soon!

355
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
We'll see you.

356
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,940
Good-bye!

357
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,700
Lucky thing Germany
is closer than Russia.

358
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,100
After six years,
the return of spring fashion.

359
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,740
Fresh and breezy...

360
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,460
unlike the pompous styles
of wartime.

361
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,740
l'll make mincemeat of you!

362
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,700
''You'll reckon with me!''

363
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,100
Another sad page...

364
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,980
in the tragedy
of our men in Russia.

365
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,340
The Defense Ministry...

366
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,380
has released a new list
of ltalian dead...

367
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,220
until now considered missing.

368
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,820
The names will be posted
by local military authorities.

369
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,820
Families concerned
will be notified.

370
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,740
However, we don't know
where he's buried.

371
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,060
Here's the pension form.
Sign it, please.

372
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,460
Out! Go home!
We can't have another show!

373
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,780
lt's late. Be reasonable.
We can't show it again!

374
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,660
Some people
sat through it twice!

375
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,060
We've been waiting for an hour!

376
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,820
Tomorrow we'll have another movie.

377
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:25,140
A western. Word of Honor!
Go home to bed.

378
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,580
They'll wreck the Paradiso!
All hell will break loose!

379
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,820
Alfredo, let us in!

380
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,980
What can l do?

381
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,340
l've been waiting for
3 hours!

382
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,020
''A mob doesn't think.

383
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,260
lt has a mind of its own.''

384
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,340
Spencer Tracy said that in ''Fury.''

385
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,300
Well, what do you say?

386
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,980
Shall we let the poor devils
see their film?

387
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,220
Fantastic. But how?

388
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:12,060
''lf you have no faith in me,
have faith in what you see.''

389
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,260
Now get your fanny off that stool.

390
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,420
Get ready.

391
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,580
Abracadabra...

392
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,900
and we pass through walls.

393
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,780
Go look out the window.

394
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,060
Alfredo, it's beautiful.

395
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,180
Over there! lt's the movie!

396
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,900
Bravo, Alfredo.

397
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,660
Thank you, Alfredo!

398
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,660
What's going on?

399
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,380
lt's a movie!

400
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,740
To hell with you.

401
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,500
There's no sound!

402
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,260
Shall we make them happy?

403
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,740
Want to go down?

404
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,300
Go on.

405
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,460
- Look.
- Good Lord.

406
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,820
And Nunzio, half price.

407
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,660
Have to buy tickets, folks.

408
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,100
Reduced rates.

409
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,100
Up yours! The square
belongs to everyone!

410
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,460
Oh, no!

411
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,860
The square is mine!
Don't joke about that! lt makes me mad!

412
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,940
Alfredo!

413
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:11,820
Alfredo! No! Alfredo!

414
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,980
Alfredo, Alfredo.
Help! Help!

415
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,580
Alfredo, Alfredo!

416
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,100
Help!

417
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,700
Poor Alfredo.
What a shame.

418
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,900
All burned!

419
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,860
lt all burned down!

420
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,500
What do we do now?

421
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,180
We have no more entertainment.
Nothing.

422
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,420
Where'll we get the money
to rebuild?

423
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,140
Take a look at Ciccio.
So spiffy, you'd hardly know him.

424
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,580
Who has that kind of money?

425
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,180
The new Cinema Paradiso!

426
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,500
Come in, come in.

427
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,460
This theater is for you!

428
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,100
He's just a boy.
What about labor laws?

429
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,860
l got the license
through connections.

430
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,180
Don't ask me
how their minds work.

431
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,820
Officially, l'm the projectionist,
but the money goes to Toto.

432
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,860
Stay on your toes, Toto.
No sleeping.

433
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,060
We've had enough disasters.

434
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,740
Do what poor Alfredo taught you.
And God bless you.

435
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,580
Thank you, Father.

436
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:51,740
What is this, a funeral?
Life goes on! Gaiety! Music!

437
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,620
Get a load of that!

438
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,980
Our Father--

439
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,060
My God, they're kissing!

440
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,180
l won't watch pornography.

441
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,700
Three cheers for Ciccio!

442
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,740
Any room for me
in this new paradise?

443
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,260
Alfredo!

444
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,380
Bring him home after you close.

445
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,060
l'm going, Alfredo.

446
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,020
lt's great you came.

447
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,940
How're things at school?

448
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,300
Fine, but now that l'm working...

449
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,380
maybe l won't go anymore.

450
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,300
No. No, Toto.

451
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,940
Don't do that.

452
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,420
You'll end up
with egg on your face.

453
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,140
Why? What does that mean?

454
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,060
lt means...

455
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,620
that this isn't your real work.

456
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,340
Right now
the Paradiso needs you...

457
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,340
and you need the Paradiso...

458
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,820
but it's a stopgap.

459
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,540
One day you'll go on...
to other things.

460
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,660
Things...

461
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,140
that are more important.

462
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,060
Definitely more important.

463
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,860
l know.
Now that l've lost my sight...

464
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,780
l see better.

465
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,500
Things l never saw before.

466
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,940
All thanks to you,
who saved my life.

467
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,900
l won't forget it.

468
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,820
And don't look like that.

469
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,340
l'm not senile yet.
Want proof?

470
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,700
- Yes.
- Well, let's see.

471
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,620
For example...

472
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,820
right now, the film's out of focus.

473
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,380
Go check.

474
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,340
You're right,
it's out of focus.

475
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,460
How'd you know?

476
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,260
Too hard to explain.

477
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:52,220
What's the idea? Watch the screen.
Animals, rapists!

478
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,740
Look, don't touch.

479
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,980
l told you...
lt doesn't catch fire.

480
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,300
Progress always comes too late.

481
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,620
Workers of the world--

482
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,700
She's new.

483
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,340
Not bad.

484
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,780
Approachable.

485
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,780
Father's the bank manager.
Pride, pomp and circumstance.

486
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:37,460
Jerks off with his shirt,
not to get his hand dirty.

487
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,620
Go, man, go!

488
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,740
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

489
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,820
You dropped this.

490
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,420
Oh, thanks.

491
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,660
l didn't even notice.

492
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,620
My name's Salvatore.
What's yours?

493
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,100
Elena.
My name's Elena.

494
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,900
l wanted to tell you, well,
the other day at the station--

495
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,860
The small projector?
Your footage?

496
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,580
What do you see?

497
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:43,220
Slaughterhouse workers
killing a heifer.

498
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,420
Blood all over the floor,
like a lake.

499
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:50,100
Over the lake comes
another heifer...

500
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,380
about to die.

501
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,460
Why'd you stop?
What do we see?

502
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:09,660
Nothing. We don't see anything.
lt's all fuzzy.

503
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:12,940
A woman.

504
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:17,140
lt's a woman.

505
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:21,100
Yes, a girl l saw
at the station.

506
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,220
What's she like?

507
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,140
She's very nice.

508
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:31,380
My age, slim,
long hair, brown.

509
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:35,380
Big eyes, very blue,
honest and direct.

510
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,540
A little beauty mark
on her lip.

511
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,020
Very small.
You only see it up close.

512
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:47,140
When she smiles, you feel like--
l don't know.

513
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,900
Love.

514
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,420
Love.

515
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:01,380
l know how it is...
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

516
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,340
No matter what you do,
they'll never be your friends.

517
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,820
Nothing for it.

518
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,580
The bigger the man,
the deeper his imprint.

519
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:15,940
And if he loves, he suffers,
knowing it's a dead-end street.

520
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,500
That's nice,
what you just said.

521
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,980
But sad.

522
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,740
l didn't say it. lt was John Wayne
in ''The Shepherd of the Hills.''

523
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,860
You old pirate.

524
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,180
- Hello, Elena.
- Hello.

525
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,140
Why're you running?

526
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,900
Because...

527
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,980
l wanted to tell you...

528
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,020
you remember when we--

529
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,420
Nice day, isn't it?

530
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,500
Yes, really nice.

531
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,220
Excuse me, l have to go.
Bye.

532
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,500
What a jerk. What a jerk!

533
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,380
''Nice day, isn't it?''

534
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,580
Of all the assholes!

535
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,020
l told you so.

536
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,340
You thought l was joking.

537
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:51,540
But take it from me,
the blue-eyed ones are the worst.

538
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:55,100
But why? There must be a way
to make her understand.

539
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:59,820
Don't even try. With feelings,
there's nothing to understand...

540
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,740
and no way to explain.

541
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,180
Oh, you made the world!

542
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,100
With due respect to the Lord...

543
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,340
who made the world in 2, 3 days...

544
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,980
l'd have taken a bit longer...

545
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,940
but in all modesty,
l would've done it better.

546
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:17,940
Like l said...
you always have an answer.

547
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:24,460
Just for you, Toto,
l'll tell you a story.

548
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,420
Let's sit down a minute.

549
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,780
Misery of miseries.

550
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,020
Once...

551
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,460
a king gave a feast...

552
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:39,100
for the loveliest princesses
in the realm.

553
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:43,260
Now, a soldier
who was standing guard...

554
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,820
saw the king's daughter go by.

555
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,300
She was the most beautiful of all...

556
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:51,620
and he instantly fell in love.

557
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,380
But what is a simple soldier...

558
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,060
next to the daughter of a king?

559
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:02,340
Well, at last he succeeded
in meeting her...

560
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,380
and he told her he could no longer
live without her.

561
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:11,220
The princess was so taken
by the depth of his feeling...

562
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,540
that she said to the soldier...

563
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:16,500
''lf you can wait...

564
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:21,100
for 100 days and 100 nights
under my balcony...

565
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:25,420
at the end of it,
l shall be yours.''

566
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:31,420
With that, the soldier went
and waited one day...

567
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,300
two days, then ten,
then twenty.

568
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:37,540
Each evening
the princess looked out...

569
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,740
and he never moved!

570
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:43,380
ln rain, in wind, in snow,
he was always there.

571
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,740
Birds shat on his head,
bees stung him...

572
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,660
but he didn't budge.

573
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,020
At the end...

574
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,100
of 90 days...

575
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,620
he had become...

576
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,020
all dry, all white.

577
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,700
Tears streamed from his eyes.

578
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,940
He couldn't hold them back.

579
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:14,100
He didn't even have
the strength to sleep.

580
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:19,220
And all that time,
the princess watched him.

581
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:23,700
At long last,
it was the 99th night...

582
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:28,740
and the soldier stood up,
took his chair...

583
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,180
and left.

584
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,100
What? At the end?

585
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,260
At the very end.

586
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,660
And don't ask what it means.
l don't know.

587
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,540
lf you understand it,
you tell me.

588
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,700
Only one print?

589
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:04,100
You know l need two.
One for the Paradiso...

590
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,100
one for the next town.

591
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:12,060
You promised. l put up posters,
made commitments!

592
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,260
lf you screw me, watch out!

593
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:17,300
One print for two theaters!

594
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,060
You'll pay for this!

595
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:23,300
l'm from Naples,
and you will see it and die!

596
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:03,380
We see the crib.
The child's asleep.

597
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:23,940
''Do something!''

598
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,260
The lawyer told me.
Now l know.

599
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:33,540
''The lawyer told me.
Now l know.''

600
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:38,980
And everyone must know.
Yes, everyone must know.

601
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,740
''Everyone must know.''

602
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,620
You believe me?

603
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,220
''You believe me?''

604
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,300
Yes, l believe you.

605
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,660
''Yes, l believe you.''

606
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,100
Our own home.
How l've dreamed of it.

607
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,020
- ''Our own home.''
- ''How l've dreamed of it.''

608
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,260
Tonino!

609
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:21,260
Mama.

610
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,580
Mama!

611
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,580
The End.

612
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:55,180
l don't like it.
l don't like it.

613
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:03,260
l cut the end credits
to go faster.

614
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,700
Hurry back with part one.
l'll show a newsreel.

615
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,260
l'll call the police.
Take him.

616
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:14,500
Just a minute.
Just a minute!

617
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,620
Give me part two.
Here's part one.

618
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,140
Hurry, the house is packed.

619
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:44,260
Come on, slowpoke.
Get her rolling!

620
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,460
Bunch of animals.
Quiet!

621
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,440
Come on, Toto,
they'll explode!

622
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,600
lt's been a half hour!

623
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,160
What can l do?

624
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,880
Where is that son of a jackass?
l'll be ruined.

625
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,880
Calm down, calm down.

626
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,960
l'll have you know,
just to see this movie...

627
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,960
l left my wife home
sick in bed...

628
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,360
and l haven't seen a thing.

629
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,680
lf it's not here in ten minutes,
give us back our money.

630
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,960
Me and everyone here!

631
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,640
Or with this,
l'll wreck the place!

632
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,360
Calm down!
Calm down and let me talk.

633
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,400
Tell you what.
l'll show part one another time.

634
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,800
Quiet, quiet!

635
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,840
l've seen the whole movie.
l'll tell you the plot.

636
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,400
Alfredo, what is it?

637
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,720
l can't.
The Host is on the altar.

638
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,920
Father, l need you urgently...

639
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,600
because l have doubts...

640
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,880
terrible doubts
tormenting my soul.

641
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,720
Your soul.

642
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,640
Father, l've sinned.

643
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,640
- Do that after.
- But who--

644
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,600
Stay there. Don't move.

645
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,080
Just act normal.
lt's Salvatore.

646
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,720
How'd you get here?

647
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,960
Alfredo, that's
a terrible thing to say.

648
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:10,960
l know.

649
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,840
But take the miracle
of the loaves and fishes.

650
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,200
What about it?

651
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,960
l always wonder...
how is it possible?

652
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,400
l had to talk to you.

653
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,280
You're beautiful, Elena.

654
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,760
That's what l wanted to tell you.

655
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,800
When we meet,
l can't say anything right...

656
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,880
because you give me the shivers.

657
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,480
l don't know what others do
in these cases.

658
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,760
lt's my first time.

659
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,600
But l'm in love with you.

660
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,000
Father, l have sinned.

661
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,120
l absolve you,
in the name of the Father...

662
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,560
Son and Holy Ghost.

663
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,480
Go in peace.

664
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,400
When you laugh,
you're even prettier.

665
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,000
Salvatore, you're very sweet,
and l like you very much...

666
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,560
but l don't love you.

667
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,200
l don't care.
l'll wait.

668
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,600
What?

669
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,800
For you to fall in love with me.

670
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,760
Now listen.

671
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:41,080
Every night after work,
l'll come stand outside your house.

672
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,040
And l'll wait. Every night.

673
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,960
When you change your mind,
open your window.

674
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,200
That's all.
l'll understand.

675
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,640
You understand now?

676
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:55,720
Yes, finally,
l see the light.

677
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,280
Next time, don't talk heresy.

678
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,920
You survived the theater fire,

679
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,280
but from the Eternal Fire--
that is, Eternal Fire--

680
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,960
no one can save you.

681
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:51,200
Fifteen seconds to the new year!

682
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,200
14, 13, 12

683
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,120
11, 10, 9, 8...

684
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,560
Salvatore.

685
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,680
Oh, great.
Never been driven, he said.

686
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,800
How'll we get home?

687
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,040
Stop!

688
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,400
Oh, God, it's my father.

689
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,680
Hello, Mr. Mendola.

690
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

691
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,520
Play at an open-air theater.

692
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,160
Standing room only!

693
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,280
Come on in.
The show just started.

694
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,200
Have your tickets ready.

695
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,520
Salvatore, my love.

696
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,040
A whole summer with my family,
far from you,

697
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,400
my days here go on forever.

698
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:06,720
l see your name everywhere
in a book, a crossword puzzle...

699
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,080
a newspaper.

700
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,560
You're always before my eyes.

701
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,640
Today, alas, l have bad news.

702
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:16,760
ln October we move to Palermo,
where l'll go to university.

703
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,240
So we won't see each other
every day.

704
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,800
But don't worry,
whenever l can get away...

705
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,080
l'll come to you
at the Paradiso.

706
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,800
l'm blind!

707
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:49,640
By God's might, by man's running!
Rise up!

708
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,280
When will this rotten summer end?

709
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,280
ln a film, it'd already be over.

710
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,400
Fade-out: cut to storm.
Wouldn't that be great?

711
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,320
Tell them l am Odyssey!

712
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,800
Elena--
But when?

713
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,520
Today.

714
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,680
You can't imagine the excuses
l made up to come here.

715
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,880
l'm doing my military service in Rome.
l leave Friday.

716
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,240
l'll come to say good-bye
at the Paradiso.

717
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,800
l'll arrive Thursday,
by 5 p.m. bus.

718
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:43,880
Maybe the army made a mistake.
Anyway, Rome is beautiful.

719
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,080
Load the reels for tomorrow,
ready for the new man.

720
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:52,400
Hey, cheer up.

721
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,800
l'll wait for you.
Don't worry.

722
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,760
The job'll still be here.

723
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,640
l'll wait, you hear?

724
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,040
Don't look so gloomy.

725
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,680
Come on! Hup!

726
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,000
Radioman Di Vita, 3rd Battalion,
9th Company, sir!

727
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:51,400
Transferred her father? No way!
And no one knows where?

728
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,480
Screw you if you won't tell me!
Asshole son of a bitch!

729
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,960
You're thinner.

730
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,600
Put you through it, eh?

731
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,960
They tell me you never go out...

732
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,720
and you never talk to anybody.

733
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,880
Why?

734
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,120
You know how it is.

735
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:59,160
Sooner or later the time comes...

736
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,400
whether you talk or don't talk...

737
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,320
it's the same thing.

738
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,520
So you might as well shut up.

739
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,920
lt's hot here.

740
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,320
Take me to the sea.

741
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:24,000
At a party, a lieutenant
pinches this girl's ass.

742
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:27,840
She turns around.
lt's the colonel's daughter.

743
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,600
Terrified, the lieutenant says...

744
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:34,640
''lf your heart is as hard
as what l just felt, l'm a dead man.''

745
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,240
You haven't seen her?

746
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,720
No.

747
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,000
And no one knows where she is.

748
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,600
Probably that's how
it was meant to be.

749
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:57,920
We, each of us, have
a star to follow.

750
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,840
Get out of here.

751
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,760
This land is cursed.

752
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,680
Living here day by day...

753
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,120
you think it's
the center of the world.

754
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:13,960
You believe nothing
will ever change.

755
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:17,560
Then you leave...
a year, two years.

756
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:20,120
When you come back,
everything's changed.

757
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,920
The thread's broken.

758
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,600
What you came to find isn't there.

759
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,560
What was yours is gone.

760
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,320
You have to go away
for a long time...

761
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,560
many years...

762
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:38,480
before you can come back
and find your people.

763
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,880
The land where you were born.

764
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,040
But now, no.
lt's not possible.

765
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,760
Right now
you're blinder than l am.

766
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,600
Who said that? Gary Cooper?
James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

767
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,520
No, Toto.

768
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,080
Nobody said it.

769
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,640
This time it's all me.

770
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,480
Life isn't like in the movies.

771
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,760
Life...

772
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,720
is much harder.

773
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:13,320
Get out of here.

774
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,480
Go back to Rome.
You're young...

775
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,880
the world is yours.

776
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,760
And l'm old.

777
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,640
l don't want to hear you
talk anymore.

778
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,080
l want to hear talk about you.

779
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,240
Don't come back.

780
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,320
Don't think about us.

781
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,160
Don't look back. Don't write.

782
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:56,600
Don't give in to nostalgia.
Forget us all.

783
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,880
lf you do and you come back,
don't come see me.

784
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:03,480
l won't let you in my house.
Understand?

785
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,040
Thank you.

786
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:15,400
For everything you've done for me.

787
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,840
Whatever you end up doing,
love it.

788
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,880
The way you loved
the projection booth...

789
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,720
when you were a little squirt.

790
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,960
He's left.
Toto! Good-bye!

791
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,680
Got here too late,
what a shame.

792
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,600
lt's Toto. l knew it.

793
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,040
See how nice the house is?

794
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:30,080
We had it all redone,
all thanks to you.

795
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:33,760
l have a surprise for you.
Come.

796
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,400
Are you tired?

797
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:39,320
You have time to rest
before the funeral.

798
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:42,840
No, Mama,
it's only an hour by plane.

799
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,600
Don't tell me that
after all these years.

800
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:50,680
Come. l put everything in here.
All your things.

801
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,600
He must be glad you came, Toto.

802
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,400
He always talked about you.
Always.

803
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,240
Right up to the end.

804
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:52,400
He really--
He really loved you.

805
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,160
He left something for you.

806
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,440
Before you leave...

807
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,400
come see me.

808
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,840
How have you been?

809
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:57,200
When did you close it down?

810
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,640
Six years ago in May.
Nobody came anymore.

811
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:06,520
You know better than l, Mr. Di Vita--
the economy, TV, videos.

812
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:10,200
The old movie business
is just a memory.

813
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:15,520
The city bought the site
for a parking lot.

814
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:19,240
They're demolishing it Saturday.
lt's too bad.

815
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,200
What's this ''Mr. Di Vita''?

816
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,200
You used to order me around.

817
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:31,000
Now that you're a big shot,
it's a little different.

818
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,360
But, if you insist, Toto.

819
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,840
Excuse me.

820
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,720
Who would've believed it--
little Toto.

821
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:04,600
This is...what he left for you.

822
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,600
He never asked to see me?

823
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:11,120
No, never.

824
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:16,120
Once your mother said to him...

825
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:19,320
that if he wanted it,
you'd surely come.

826
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,320
He was furious.
He said, ''No.

827
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,680
Toto must never come back
to Giancaldo!''

828
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,840
He didn't say it to be mean.

829
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,920
He was a good man.

830
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,920
Who knows what was going
through his head.

831
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:44,040
Towards the end,
he said strange things.

832
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:50,600
A moment before
he closed his eyes...

833
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:54,840
he told your mother
she mustn't let you know.

834
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,560
What're you thinking?

835
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:06,760
Just that l've always been
afraid to come back.

836
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:14,040
And now, after all these years,
l thought l was stronger...

837
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,440
that l'd forgotten
a lot of things.

838
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:19,840
But in fact...

839
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,280
l find l'm right back
where l was...

840
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,000
as if l'd never been away.

841
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,760
Yet when l look around,
l don't recognize anyone.

842
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,400
And you, Mama...

843
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,560
l deserted you.

844
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,640
Ran out on you like a bandit...

845
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:43,720
without any explanation.

846
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,480
l never asked for any.

847
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,960
You don't have to explain to me.

848
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:52,760
l always thought it was good
what you did. Why harp on it?

849
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,720
You were right to leave.

850
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,560
You did what you wanted to do.

851
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,680
When l call you,
a different woman always answers.

852
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,960
But l never heard
in any of their voices...

853
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,040
that they really loved you.

854
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,400
l would've known.

855
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,520
All the same, l'd have liked...

856
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,800
to see you settled...

857
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,720
loving someone.

858
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,880
But your life is there.

859
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,800
Here there are only ghosts.

860
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,320
Let go, Toto.

861
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:58,240
lt's my square. lt's mine.

862
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:30,400
Check the leader.
Roll when you're ready.

863
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:33,080
Right. And l liked your film.
Terrific.

864
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:33,960
Thanks.

865
01:56:57,100 --> 01:58:00,961
