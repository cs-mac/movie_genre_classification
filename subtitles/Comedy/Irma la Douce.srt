1
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,354
Tell me, how'd a nice girl like you
get into a racket like this?

2
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:22,111
I was studying at the Paris Conservatory.
I was going to be a concert pianist.

3
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,152
Chopin and Debussy, and like that.

4
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,670
And then the night of my first recital,
the piano cover fell on my hand.

5
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,996
Three broken fingers and a broken dream.

6
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,310
After that I didn't care what happened...

7
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,034
...as long as I could feed
myself and my little dog.

8
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,359
Thank you.

9
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,913
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

10
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,316
You mean, why does a girl like me
have to do this for a living?

11
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,513
Well, actually, I'm Belgian. My parents
were missionaries in the Congo.

12
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:43,308
I don't wanna talk about that.

13
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,671
- I understand.
- So now there's just me and my sister.

14
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:51,632
She's in the hospital.
Needs three transfusions a day.

15
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:55,307
D'you know how much
a pint of blood costs these days?

16
00:03:56,558 --> 00:03:58,514
Thank you.

17
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:46,670
Sorry, pooch. What's his name?

18
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:48,788
Her name. Coquette.

19
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:53,275
- And what's yours?
- Irma. They call me Irma la Douce.

20
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,674
That means Irma the Sweet.
I don't know why.

21
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:01,230
I know why. How much is that, in dollars?

22
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,953
Five dollars. Actually,
I don't even know my real name.

23
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,990
I was brought up in an orphanage near
Cherbourg - it was destroyed on D-day.

24
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:14,066
I've been sending money to help rebuild
it. I've already paid for a whole wing.

25
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:16,591
Uh...

26
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:19,151
That's all I have on me, ma'am.

27
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:23,555
Actually, it was bombed by the Eighth Air
Force. Not that I blame you Americans.

28
00:05:23,677 --> 00:05:28,113
But if you could see those poor orphans,
sleeping on the floor, the rain coming in.

29
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:30,591
There are no beds yet and no roof.

30
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,712
Uh...

31
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,590
Do y'all take traveller's cheques?

32
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:16,503
<i>This, then,
is the story of Irma la Douce.</i>

33
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:21,107
<i>A story of passion,
bloodshed, desire and death.</i>

34
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:24,944
<i>Everything, in fact,
that makes life worth living.</i>

35
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:30,908
<i>The place is Paris, the time
is five o'clock in the morning.</i>

36
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:38,715
<i>You may have read in travel folders
that Paris is a city that never sleeps.</i>

37
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,190
<i>Don't you believe it.</i>

38
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:46,348
<i>At this time of the day
there is nothing doing...</i>

39
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:50,434
<i>... unless you're working for
the department of sanitation.</i>

40
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:56,784
<i>If you want a nightcap
at Maxim's, it's too late.</i>

41
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:59,270
<i>It's been closed for hours.</i>

42
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,624
<i>If you want to jump off
the Eiffel Tower, it's too early.</i>

43
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:08,110
<i>It won't be open for hours.</i>

44
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:14,270
<i>So, if you're looking for a little action,
forget the high-rent district.</i>

45
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:17,626
<i>You'd better come to our neighbourhood.</i>

46
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:21,789
<i>This is Les Halles,
the wholesale food market.</i>

47
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:24,747
<i>We call it the stomach of Paris.</i>

48
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,668
<i>Keep your Champs Élysées
and your palace in Versailles.</i>

49
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:39,869
<i>This is the place for me:
Brawling, vulgar, smelly, but alive.</i>

50
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:48,343
<i>Beef from Charollais,
pork from Périgord...</i>

51
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:51,511
<i>... lamb from Brittany, veal from Normandy.</i>

52
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,431
<i>Brains and kidneys and tripe.</i>

53
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:03,672
<i>Pigs' feet and calves' heads
waiting for sauce vinaigrette.</i>

54
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:10,632
<i>Salmon from the Loire,
sole from the Channel...</i>

55
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,824
<i>... Iobsters from Corsica...</i>

56
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:16,583
<i>... oysters from Dieppe,
sardines from Lorient.</i>

57
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:21,670
<i>Asparagus from Argenteuil,
oranges from Valencia...</i>

58
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:25,581
<i>... melons from Cavaillon,
cabbage from Aubervilliers.</i>

59
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:29,711
<i>But man does not live by cabbage alone.</i>

60
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:36,308
<i>And if that's what you're in the market for,
just step into the Rue Casanova.</i>

61
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,347
<i>This is where the girls are,
or, as we say, the "poules".</i>

62
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:43,306
<i>You can have your choice of
Kiki the Cossack, Amazon Annie...</i>

63
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:46,789
<i>... Lolita, Suzette Wong,
Mimi the Maumau...</i>

64
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,474
<i>... and then, of course,
there's Irma la Douce.</i>

65
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:52,983
<i>She was born here, in Les Halles,
in a truck behind the fish market.</i>

66
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:57,709
<i>Like all the others, she takes her coffee
break in the bistro across the street.</i>

67
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:01,749
<i>This is the owner.
He is known as Moustache.</i>

68
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:04,910
<i>According to police records,
he is a Romanian chicken thief...</i>

69
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:08,230
<i>... named Constantinescu,
but when he bought this place...</i>

70
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:11,868
<i>... it was called "Chez Moustache" and
it was cheaper to grow a moustache...</i>

71
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:14,552
<i>... than to buy a new sign.</i>

72
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:18,951
<i>Sometimes, at dawn, rich slummers
drop in for a bowl of onion soup.</i>

73
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:23,863
<i>But mostly the clientele consists
of the "poules" and their "macs".</i>

74
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:28,501
<i>You know what a "mac" is?
How do you say it in English?</i>

75
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:32,227
<i>A protector, a consort,
a business manager?</i>

76
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,389
<i>Well, stick around, you'll get the idea.</i>

77
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:46,063
- How are we doin'?
- Not bad.

78
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:51,307
Mostly tips. I had
some real pigeons tonight.

79
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:54,231
- Sometimes I wish you were twins.
- Thanks.

80
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:57,869
- What's that?
- What's what? Oh, that.

81
00:09:57,992 --> 00:10:01,064
The last one didn't have any more money,
so he gave me a cheque.

82
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:03,422
Now is that nice, Irma,
holding out on me?

83
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:06,749
- It's only ten dollars.
- And you weren't gonna tell me about it?

84
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,830
I was gonna put it down
as a deposit, on a hair dryer.

85
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:13,911
A hair dryer?! We're partners, Irma.
You wouldn't wanna cheat me?

86
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:17,228
- Let go, Hippolyte.
- There's such a thing as ethics.

87
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:19,024
You're hurting me, you big ox!

88
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,780
If you don't like the way I treat you,
why don't you get yourself another guy?

89
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:26,461
- I will one of these days.
- Why wait? Why not leave me now?

90
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:29,701
I'd take her any time.

91
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:32,471
Oh, you would?

92
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,822
- It was just a joke, Hippolyte.
- A joke?

93
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:38,306
So how come nobody's laughing?

94
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,388
Now go back to work.

95
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,028
Ox.

96
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:02,423
<i>And so it was one big,
happy family around here:</i>

97
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,588
<i>The "macs", the "poules" and the "flics"...</i>

98
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:08,066
<i>... or as you would say, the cops.</i>

99
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,625
<i>Your statesmen and politicians keep
talking about peaceful coexistence...</i>

100
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:30,265
<i>... but here, in our milieu,
we really practise it.</i>

101
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,144
<i>The attitude of the police
is live and let live.</i>

102
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,546
<i>And some of them make
a pretty good living at it.</i>

103
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,340
<i>Every other Friday the "flics" would raid
Rue Casanova, just for the record.</i>

104
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,019
<i>A few "poules" would be hauled to
the station, they'd pay a small fine...</i>

105
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,858
<i>... and 24 hours later
they'd be back on the street.</i>

106
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,743
<i>It was a nice, friendly,
civilised arrangement.</i>

107
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,146
<i>Everybody looked the other way,
everybody kept his mouth shut...</i>

108
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,104
<i>... nobody got hurt,
except maybe an occasional fly.</i>

109
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:08,819
<i>And then, one day, disaster.</i>

110
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,908
<i>An honest policeman came on the beat.</i>

111
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:54,699
Coquette. Come here, Coquette.
You naughty girl.

112
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:56,863
Pardon me, do you have a licence?

113
00:13:56,988 --> 00:14:00,776
- A licence? No.
- It's a violation of ordinance number 56.

114
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,102
Oh, usually they let us get away with it.

115
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:07,016
Not me. And according to the law,
you're supposed to keep it on a leash.

116
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:09,104
On a leash?

117
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:12,060
Oh! Oh, of course.

118
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:14,940
- I'll remember that.
- Now, just a moment.

119
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:20,701
What are all you girls doing around here
at this hour of the morning?

120
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,943
I don't know about them,
I'm walking my dog.

121
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:25,821
- Oh, I see.
- I have to take her out all the time.

122
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,700
- She has kidney stones.
- That's a shame.

123
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:33,143
Look, it... if you
don't mind my saying so...

124
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:38,863
Oh, I'm sorry.

125
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,346
I've never seen a girl
in green stockings before.

126
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,981
It matches the ribbon and my underwear.

127
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:48,462
Green underwear?

128
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:52,503
- You're new around here, aren't you?
- It's my first day.

129
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:55,266
- I thought so.
- I've been on the force for six months.

130
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:58,935
I was stationed at the Bois de Boulogne,
by the lake, where the children play?

131
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,139
- That's where I got this medal.
- For keeping kids off the grass?

132
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:05,179
I saved a boy from drowning,
mouth-to-mouth respiration.

133
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:08,776
So they thought I was ready for
bigger things and transferred me here.

134
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:12,535
- Well, you're going to like it here.
- I'm not so sure.

135
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,780
If I were you, I'd exercise
that dog somewhere else.

136
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:21,466
- Why?
- Those girls over there.

137
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:24,859
Something tells me they're streetwalkers.

138
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:29,219
- No?
- Yes. I can spot 'em six blocks away.

139
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:33,583
Say, Irma, I just got off work,
so if you're not busy...

140
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:37,494
- I beg your pardon?
- It's me, André, wholesale artichokes.

141
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:39,777
- I don't need any.
- What the matter with you?

142
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,942
You want me to take my business to Kiki?

143
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:46,024
- Is this man annoying you?
- It's all right. Not now. Come back later.

144
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,785
Later? I've only got a half-hour.

145
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,379
Look, Officer, there's
a truck double-parked there.

146
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:55,383
- Now, why don't you do your duty?
- Maybe I will.

147
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:58,304
- He takes his work very seriously.
- I try.

148
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:03,215
- See you again sometime.
- I wouldn't be surprised.

149
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:39,418
- What'll it be, Officer? Cognac?
- No, no. I never drink when I'm on duty.

150
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:44,938
In fact, I never drink when I'm off duty.
Maybe just a little glass of Vichy water.

151
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,661
<i>Looking for something, Officer?</i>

152
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:57,904
- What do you know about that hotel?
- Casanova slept there in 1763.

153
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:01,574
I'm not talking about 1763. Since
I've been here, four couples walked in.

154
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:04,094
Monday is always a slow night.

155
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:09,298
Just between us, would you have even
a vague idea what they're doing in there?

156
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:12,621
I have a very definite idea.
They're making love.

157
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:15,577
- That's illegal.
- Shows you the kind of world we live in.

158
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:17,934
Love is illegal, but not hate.

159
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:20,499
That you can do anywhere,
anytime, to anybody.

160
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:25,095
But if you want a little warmth, a shoulder
to cry on, a smile to cuddle up with...

161
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:28,456
...you have to hide in dark corners
like a criminal. Pfui!

162
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:33,056
- I wouldn't call that love.
- Spoken like a petit bourgeois.

163
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,938
It's flagrant vice
and must be stamped out.

164
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:40,262
My dear boy, your thinking is not
only fuzzy, it's economically unsound.

165
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:42,454
And I know what I'm talking about.

166
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:45,223
I used to be professor
of economics at the Sorbonne.

167
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:47,983
- A professor?
- For six years, but that's another story.

168
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:51,938
Then you should agree decent citizens
have a right to be protected from this.

169
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:56,454
Let's take one, married for 20 years,
works hard all day selling baby carriages.

170
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:59,144
In the evening he wants
a little fun, companionship.

171
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:03,495
So he comes to Rue Casanova. He meets
a girl, she gives him companionship...

172
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,421
...he gives her money.
She gives it to her boyfriend...

173
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:10,457
...the boyfriend spends it on drinks,
on cuff links, at the racetrack.

174
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:14,735
Sometimes he even pays
a little money to a policeman.

175
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:17,252
- Bribe a policeman?
- That's the beauty of it.

176
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:20,774
The policeman takes it and buys
a baby carriage from the decent citizen.

177
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:23,019
Thusly, money is kept in circulation.

178
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,498
Everybody's prosperous,
everybody's happy.

179
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:27,693
- I don't believe it.
- It's elementary.

180
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:30,542
I don't believe there are
policemen who take money.

181
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:32,779
Oh, not all policemen take money.

182
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:37,021
Some of the higher-ups have a more
intimate arrangement with the girls.

183
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:41,136
Well, there's one policeman
around here who isn't corrupt.

184
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:53,095
You wouldn't know the number
of the police station, would you?

185
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:57,580
Central 5288. But I wouldn't be
so impetuous if I were you.

186
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,659
Have your Vichy.

187
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:13,617
Desk sergeant? It's Officer Patou. I want
a police van sent to the Hotel Casanova.

188
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:16,814
Violation of section 34
of the criminal code.

189
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:20,981
Not littering the sidewalks, that's section
43. This is lewd and immoral conduct.

190
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:24,936
There goes another couple.
I'm gonna raid the place.

191
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:30,653
You're asking for trouble, my friend.

192
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:34,695
To be too honest in a dishonest world is
like plucking a chicken against the wind.

193
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:38,053
You'll only wind up
with a mouthful of feathers.

194
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:40,742
Don't worry, old man.
I know what I'm doing.

195
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:02,981
- Do you have a fire alarm here?
- Oh, a fire...?

196
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,332
Oh, yes. It's right over there.

197
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:08,692
Yes, Officer.
Oh, it's in perfect working order.

198
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:14,296
Wh... wh... where is the fire?

199
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,498
Right here.

200
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:21,177
Oh, no, that's hot! It's hot!

201
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:27,215
Oh, no, you don't. You're under arrest.

202
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:37,373
All right! All right, everybody.
Everybody, the party's over!

203
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,573
- Girls on this side, men over here.
- Hey, what is this?

204
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,100
- A raid.
- On a Monday?

205
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,610
- It's supposed to be every other Friday.
- Can I go and get my stockings?

206
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,935
- No. Come on.
- You oughta pay me half.

207
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:50,894
<i>- It wasn't my fault.
- I don't know what she's talkin' about.</i>

208
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:54,377
- I was up there unpacking my samples.
- Come on.

209
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,457
Over.

210
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,137
You oughta be ashamed of yourself,
scaring a poor dog like that.

211
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,731
They ought to take that dog away
from you - you're not a fit mother.

212
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:08,010
Quiet, quiet!

213
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,099
I'll let you men go. We'll need you
as witnesses. Your name?

214
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,576
Jacques Casanova.

215
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,739
- What's yours?
- André Casanova.

216
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,933
- I suppose you're Pierre Casanova?
- No, I am General Lafayette.

217
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,129
Retired.

218
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,298
- All right, let's start all over again.
- And what's your name?

219
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:28,731
I'm Officer... Just a moment,
who's investigating, you or me?

220
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,010
It's an outrage. I'll see you lose your job.

221
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:33,574
- Shut up.
- Do you know who you're talking to?

222
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:37,089
<i>- Trying to bribe an officer, eh?</i>

223
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,570
Back. Everybody, back. All right,
OK, ladies, let's go. Come on. Back.

224
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:51,694
- In we go.
- Not so rough.

225
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,775
- Up, up, up.
- Watch that baton.

226
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,413
- Don't handle the merchandise.
- In you get.

227
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,609
- Take it easy, you.
- Come on.

228
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,299
Let's go, let's go. Come on. Here we go.

229
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,014
Let's go now. Here we go. Just a minute.

230
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:07,653
- No smoking in a police van.
- Who do you think you are? De Gaulle?

231
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:10,852
- Inside. Come on, come on.
- What do they expect us to do now?

232
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:14,450
<i>- Collect unemployment insurance?
- It's that new flic.</i>

233
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:18,857
One of these days I'm gonna
catch him outta uniform, and then...

234
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,529
Up, up, up. Let's go.

235
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:26,014
Who does this belong to?

236
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:58,579
Officer, would you zip my dress up?

237
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:02,612
Will you hold this, please?

238
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:15,255
Hey!

239
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:35,249
Say, Officer, do you really
have to take us to the station?

240
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:38,370
The last time we were arrested,
we drove right on to Deauville.

241
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:40,932
What a weekend!
18 girls and three policemen.

242
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:43,969
And they weren't nearly
as cute as you are.

243
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:50,655
- Wouldn't ya like a harem?
- We'll make you feel like a king.

244
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:52,733
King Farouk.

245
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,011
Oh, look, he's blushing.

246
00:23:56,697 --> 00:23:59,895
- I guess he's too young.
- Maybe if we put a moustache on him...

247
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:02,326
...he'd look older.

248
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:05,213
All right, all right!

249
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:09,376
One false move out of any one of ya,
and I'm gonna let you have it.

250
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:12,851
That's enough, girls! Leave him alone.

251
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:15,128
- He can take care of himself.
- No, he can't.

252
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:19,250
You know what he was doing before this?
Policing a children's playground.

253
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:21,938
Now, now, kids, stay out of the bushes.

254
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:26,015
- Don't take candy from strangers.
- And no playing doctor.

255
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:30,453
# Little birdie, pretty little birdie

256
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:33,934
# Little birdie, fly away with me

257
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,571
<i>- # We will build a little nest
- # We will build a little nest</i>

258
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:39,289
<i>- # Get the best

259
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,373
<i>- # In my nest
- # In my nest</i>

260
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,971
- Here, you dropped this.
- Oh, thank you.

261
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:26,929
- You're the only nice one.
- They were just pulling your leg.

262
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:29,809
And it almost came off.
Sorry I have to put you in jail.

263
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:32,733
Oh, I don't mind. I can use a little rest.

264
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:47,734
Oh. Officer Nestor Patou checking in
16 females suspected of lewd vagrancy.

265
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:52,604
- And one poodle.
- How many? 16?

266
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:55,534
Yes, Monday is a slow night,
but I'll do better next time.

267
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,805
- You will, huh?
- Definitely.

268
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:04,211
Hello?

269
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:13,404
About the little one - don't worry,
we'll feed her around here.

270
00:26:13,535 --> 00:26:16,333
Thank you, but none of that
horse meat you give police dogs.

271
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:20,209
- She's got kidney stones, remember?
- Hey, Patou!

272
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:23,805
- The inspector wants to see you.
- The inspector? Did you hear that?

273
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:27,085
<i>- The inspector wants to see me.
- Maybe they've given you a medal.</i>

274
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:29,445
Do you think so? No, not on my first day.

275
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:31,530
- In there.
- All right.

276
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:37,971
<i>Come in!</i>

277
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:46,413
Officer Patou reporting.
You sent for me... sir.

278
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:48,526
- So you're the new man?
- Yes, sir.

279
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,646
I've been wondering what you looked like.

280
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,970
- Well, you've seen me before.
- I have?

281
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:55,085
Remember? At the Hotel Casanova.

282
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:57,330
What was I doing at the Hotel Casanova?

283
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:01,414
- I don't know, but I was raiding the place.
- You were. Who authorised the raid?!

284
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:06,324
I was using my own judgement, sir. It
was an obvious violation of section 34.

285
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:08,968
We can get a conviction,
now we have you as a witness.

286
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,654
And look at your uniform! It's disgraceful!

287
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:15,210
There were 16 of them in the van,
and they were resisting arrest, sir.

288
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,370
And I was resisting, too.

289
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:20,168
I didn't lose my head,
just my gun, but I got it back.

290
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:23,252
- Take off your cap when talking to me!
- Yes, sir.

291
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:49,248
<i>Hey, chéri, you oughta
get outta those wet clothes.</i>

292
00:27:50,014 --> 00:27:51,969
I'll help you.

293
00:27:52,534 --> 00:27:54,444
Look who's here.

294
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,452
# Little birdie, pretty little birdie

295
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:00,531
# Little birdie, fly away with me

296
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:08,365
A glass of Vichy, right?

297
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:13,089
Cognac, please, to get the taste
of feathers out of my mouth.

298
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:16,727
# Little birdie, pretty little birdie

299
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:20,401
# Little birdie, fly away with me

300
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,366
- You off duty?
- Permanently.

301
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:27,808
- I've been bounced from the police force.
- You don't say?

302
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:32,404
Had the goods on me. Insubordination,
accepting bribes and a missing button.

303
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:35,808
So they took away my medal,
threw me out of the barracks.

304
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:40,605
Reminds me of when I was drummed out
of the army. Marrakech, you know.

305
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:43,372
I was a colonel in the foreign legion.

306
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:46,052
Before or after you were
a professor of economics?

307
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:49,687
No, in between I was a croupier
in Montecarlo, but that's another story.

308
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,202
Oh. Well... one more.

309
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:55,242
So, what's your next move?

310
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:58,284
I've been lookin' for a job,
applied to all the bureaus -

311
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:02,725
customs inspection, sanitation - but once
you've been dishonourably discharged...

312
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:05,650
...they won't even let you
clean the sewers.

313
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:09,048
I hate to see a young man like you
take a defeatist attitude.

314
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:13,131
The world is full of opportunities.
Just look around.

315
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:18,165
There's one-armed Jojo,
used to be a safecracker...

316
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:21,523
...till he put a little too much
nitroglycerin in a vault.

317
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:26,771
And Casablanca Charlie. Five years ago
he walked in with holes in his shoes...

318
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,166
...and a pocketful of dirty postcards.

319
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:33,888
Or take Hippolyte the Ox, used to be
a purse-snatcher around the market.

320
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:40,486
They all started at the bottom, but they
had perseverance and drive and vision.

321
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:45,844
Now they've got it made. They're retired.
They let their girls work for them.

322
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:49,605
I'm afraid I wasn't
cut out for a life of crime.

323
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:52,291
There you go, selling yourself short.

324
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:56,290
Oh, maybe I could snatch a purse
or crack a small safe...

325
00:29:56,411 --> 00:30:01,007
...but to sit around in a striped suit
while some girl out in the street... never.

326
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:03,361
You're being petit bourgeois again.

327
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:09,090
Life is total war, my friend. Nobody has
a right to be a conscientious objector.

328
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:17,326
- Cigarettes.
- A pack of Gitanes coming up.

329
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,044
- Hello.
- Hello.

330
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:22,731
- Nasty night, isn't it?
- It never fails.

331
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:25,843
Wouldn't you know, just
this afternoon I gave her a permanent.

332
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:27,926
- Put them on my bill.
- Uh...

333
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,438
Can I buy you a cheap drink?

334
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:35,359
Why not? Do you think
you can afford a peppermint tea?

335
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:38,722
- Certainly.
- One peppermint tea coming up.

336
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,610
- Here we are again.
- Again? Have we been together before?

337
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,640
I guess you don't
recognise me out of uniform.

338
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,082
Uniform? Oh, about a month ago.

339
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,520
You're that sailor with Brigitte Bardot
tattooed on your chest?

340
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,847
No, it was just this morning...
I arrested you.

341
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,485
Oh. Oh, of course.

342
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,885
I'm sorry, I never remember a face.

343
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:06,923
Oh... How long did they keep you
in the police station?

344
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:10,565
- About an hour.
- I was out much faster than that.

345
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:14,203
- Sugar?
- Thanks.

346
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,719
Say, that hotel, tell me,
what are the rates?

347
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,159
- Why?
- I'm lookin' for a room.

348
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:21,678
They charge by the hour.
Nobody can afford it.

349
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,563
Besides, they don't take
anybody with luggage.

350
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,722
Irma!

351
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,885
Let's have it.

352
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,167
- Is that all?
- It's the weather. Nothin's happening.

353
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:46,519
Well, get out and make it happen.

354
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:51,325
- Do you mind if I dry out first?
- On your way. I haven't won all evening.

355
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:06,679
When I walked the beat on a night
like this, I wore two pairs of socks.

356
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:08,765
- You oughta try it.
- And long underwear?

357
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:14,281
By all means. Also, I'd put a newspaper
inside my coat to keep my chest warm.

358
00:32:14,408 --> 00:32:17,560
Look, mister, I'm in a very
competitive business.

359
00:32:17,689 --> 00:32:22,046
Well, at least you get indoors
once in a while and off your feet.

360
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:24,557
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

361
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:28,446
You oughta cut down on it.
I mean, one after another.

362
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:32,720
- Mind your own business.
- If you wanna smoke yourself to death...

363
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:37,117
I met fellas that asked me to do a lot of
crazy things, but not give up smokin'.

364
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:40,445
Well, I don't mean to get personal,
it's just that I like you.

365
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:43,036
In Dijon there was this girl
I was in love with...

366
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,445
- And I remind you of her.
- You don't look anything like her at all.

367
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:51,881
But she was a heavy smoker, 60
cigarettes a day, coughin' all the time.

368
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,284
What are you hangin' around for?
I said out.

369
00:32:56,408 --> 00:33:00,036
- Please, you're interrupting.
- All right, we were just talking.

370
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:03,205
- About smoking.
- Talk on your own time.

371
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:07,003
I would strongly advise you
to let go of the lady.

372
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:10,484
- Oh, it's you.
- I'll give you exactly five seconds. One...

373
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:15,237
...two, three, four... five!

374
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:17,763
Well, that's better.

375
00:33:32,648 --> 00:33:34,603
Outside.

376
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:39,002
And don't come back with
any excuses. I need 100 francs.

377
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:51,080
Hey, watch it. This is a new hat.

378
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:53,163
Had enough?

379
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,482
Now I'm mad.

380
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:28,956
Now I am really mad.

381
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:31,361
And when I get mad, I'm like a tiger!

382
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,047
Do you hear that, boys? He's a tiger.

383
00:34:58,486 --> 00:35:01,046
Hey, girls! A fight!

384
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:33,602
All right... who's next?

385
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:00,600
Cognac.

386
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,240
Would you care
for another peppermint tea?

387
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:10,320
No, thank you.

388
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,718
Put everything on my bill.

389
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:17,522
- Shall we go?
- Might as well.

390
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:21,278
I'm getting bored with this place.

391
00:37:55,282 --> 00:37:58,035
- Where are we goin'?
- To my apartment.

392
00:37:58,163 --> 00:38:02,553
- I thought you lived in the hotel.
- That's my business address.

393
00:38:04,163 --> 00:38:06,518
Come on, you're getting wet.

394
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:16,512
Don't expect too much
when we get up there.

395
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:18,519
No, not at all.

396
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:21,520
- I have no rugs, no icebox.
- As long as you have an empty couch.

397
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:23,598
No couch.

398
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:32,552
I also have to get curtains.

399
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:36,914
They're working across the street,
repairing the roof, and I sleep in the nude.

400
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:41,558
Well, it's about time they started fixing
up... You mean you don't wear anything?

401
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:43,718
Nothing but a sleeping mask.

402
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:45,798
Oh.

403
00:38:46,402 --> 00:38:50,998
That's all right, because the workmen
wouldn't recognise you anyway.

404
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:56,079
You know what I've got?
An electric blanket.

405
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,716
It was a present from somebody
with the American Embassy.

406
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,271
That must be nice,
an electric blanket on a night like this.

407
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:08,475
Only it doesn't work. They've got
a different kind of electricity. AC or DC.

408
00:39:08,602 --> 00:39:12,151
- That's too bad.
- Don't worry, you won't be cold.

409
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:20,877
I'm not worried.

410
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:29,839
It's very attractive. It has atmosphere.

411
00:39:29,961 --> 00:39:32,998
Used to be a studio.
A painter once lived here.

412
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:36,875
Poor guy, he was starving.
Tried everything, even cut his ear off.

413
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:40,278
- Van Gogh?
- No, I think his name was Schwartz.

414
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:43,716
Would you believe it, I'm an artist myself.

415
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,639
- I believe it.
- See this bed?

416
00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:49,751
Yes?

417
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,872
I painted it.

418
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,957
Oh. Oh!

419
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:56,359
Very good job.

420
00:39:56,481 --> 00:40:00,110
It looked just awful when
I found it at the flea market.

421
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,591
- Can I borrow a newspaper?
- You wanna read?

422
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,032
No, of course not.
Can I take your stockings off?

423
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:24,356
Sure, go ahead.

424
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,188
You really are shy, aren't you?

425
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,515
Me? Shy?

426
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,110
Not particularly. It's... it's just...
the kind of world we live in.

427
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,030
What I mean is, if you hate somebody,
you can do that any time, any place, but...

428
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,277
...if you like somebody,
you gotta hide in dark corners.

429
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,751
You know, I'm sort of glad about
that girl in Dijon, with the cough.

430
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:27,952
- You are?
- Because frankly, in the police van...

431
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,037
...I thought that you'd
never in your life, uh...

432
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:35,153
Oh, she wasn't the only girl.
I've had more than one girl.

433
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,238
- How many?
- Altogether?

434
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:43,391
- Oh, let me see.
- Three?

435
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:46,238
Not as many as that. That is...

436
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,635
What's your name?

437
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,627
Nes... Nestor. Nestor Patou.

438
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:14,432
Well, don't take all night, Nestor Patou.

439
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:18,314
I won't.

440
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:45,146
Didn't you say you had a sleeping mask?

441
00:43:46,477 --> 00:43:48,831
You're really something.

442
00:44:26,516 --> 00:44:28,587
What's going on? What are you doing?

443
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:00,028
Irma!

444
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,349
Irma!

445
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,911
Irma!

446
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,711
Irma!

447
00:45:27,555 --> 00:45:29,511
Irma!

448
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:31,591
Irma...

449
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:34,751
<i>Where are you, Irma?!</i>

450
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:37,435
Where are you, Irma? Hm?

451
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:42,191
Hm?

452
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:57,389
What are you doing way over there?

453
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:01,702
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

454
00:46:01,835 --> 00:46:04,189
- Come back.
- What's gotten into you?

455
00:46:04,315 --> 00:46:06,987
I don't know, I guess
I've become an addict.

456
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:09,070
<i>Irma!</i>

457
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:18,387
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you!

458
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:20,991
You go to hell!

459
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:23,150
I'm coming up to get my clothes.

460
00:46:23,474 --> 00:46:25,430
Just a minute.

461
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:28,994
- Who is it? That big ox again?
- Uh-huh.

462
00:46:40,354 --> 00:46:42,583
If you have something
personal to discuss...

463
00:46:42,714 --> 00:46:45,023
No, stay right where you are.

464
00:46:47,714 --> 00:46:49,669
Catch.

465
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:57,791
But what about my suits
and my silk shirts and my jewellery?

466
00:46:58,034 --> 00:47:01,184
This is what you came with
and this is what you're leaving with.

467
00:47:01,314 --> 00:47:02,632
Why, you little...

468
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:05,393
You're lucky I don't
take back that gold tooth!

469
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:09,861
I'm gonna come up there
and break your arm!

470
00:47:10,753 --> 00:47:12,709
Oh, you are

471
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,790
Tiger.

472
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,270
Come on out, Tiger.

473
00:47:36,673 --> 00:47:39,744
You want my friend here
to beat you up again?

474
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:47,188
You'll be hearing from me.

475
00:47:51,272 --> 00:47:53,627
And stay away!

476
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:02,470
- You could beat him up again, right?
- Naturally.

477
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:06,949
It's just that I don't like to
pick on anybody who isn't my size.

478
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:18,389
How did you get mixed up with
a character like that, anyway?

479
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:21,505
Should've seen the one I had before.
He was not only mean...

480
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:25,181
...he used to run around with
other women, and on my money.

481
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:30,991
Why do you have to have anybody at all?

482
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:33,068
Everybody needs somebody.

483
00:48:33,192 --> 00:48:37,025
Like Coquette needs me.
Who wants to be a stray dog?

484
00:48:37,152 --> 00:48:41,304
You've got to belong to someone,
even if he kicks you once in a while.

485
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:44,426
- Don't you have any family?
- No.

486
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:46,949
My mother was a very successful woman.

487
00:48:47,071 --> 00:48:49,983
She used to have the same spot
outside the hotel that I do.

488
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:53,865
Then one day she met a guy,
fell in love with him and quit.

489
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:58,382
- That's very romantic.
- Romantic? It's stupid.

490
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:01,548
Gave up her career - for what?
Some slob from the market...

491
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:04,549
...dragged around heavy sides
of beef till he dropped dead.

492
00:49:04,672 --> 00:49:06,902
It was too late for Momma
to make a comeback.

493
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:10,103
She wound up as a cashier
in the fish market.

494
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:14,627
Only smart thing she ever did
was not marry my father.

495
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,947
You mean you're not le... legitimate?

496
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:19,706
That's right.

497
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:24,382
You'd think with a background like that
I'd have turned out no good.

498
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:29,380
I know you're doing very well, but a girl
like you - there's other kinds of jobs.

499
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:32,024
This isn't just a job, it's a profession.

500
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,982
Of course.

501
00:49:34,111 --> 00:49:38,627
Somebody has to do these things but,
in your case, now that I know you better...

502
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:41,469
I get that all the time.
The other night I met a man...

503
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,469
...who thought I was too good for this,
and you know what he does?

504
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:48,424
- He's a mortician. Now I ask you.
- Ask me what?

505
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,543
Why is it nine out of ten try to reform me?

506
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:53,946
You're not one of those, are you?

507
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:56,026
Who, me? Oh, no.

508
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,060
I used to be one of those.

509
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,229
Petit bourgeois, but that was yesterday.
I know better now.

510
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:14,106
I don't think she cares for me.

511
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:18,261
You two better make friends
if you're gonna live here.

512
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,223
- Live here?
- Why? Don't you like the idea?

513
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:22,988
Sure.

514
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,749
I like the idea, it's just that I had no idea.

515
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:30,021
- Is this all you've got?
- Just my old uniform and my toilet kit.

516
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,784
Try one of those suits in the closet.

517
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,866
Go ahead.

518
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:49,181
Let's see how you look in the brown one
with the pinstripes. He hardly ever wore it.

519
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:51,698
Said it was too conservative.

520
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:03,658
I'm afraid the sleeves may be a little...

521
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:07,748
Don't worry about that.
There's a brown derby that goes with it.

522
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:22,467
- What are the glasses for?
- The races.

523
00:51:23,069 --> 00:51:25,629
Oh. Gee, they look very powerful.

524
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:28,781
- Oops.
- What's the matter?

525
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,979
Wrong end.

526
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:34,579
- You want me to turn around?
- No, I mean the glasses.

527
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:39,821
I'll bet nobody ever
saw you like this before.

528
00:51:39,948 --> 00:51:42,781
- You'd lose.
- Through field glasses?

529
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:45,504
No bet.

530
00:51:46,629 --> 00:51:50,177
When I first met you, I thought
you were pretty. I was totally wrong.

531
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:52,379
You're beautiful.

532
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:57,662
- You're outta your mind or out of focus.
- Without make-up, you look about 14.

533
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:00,985
I wore make-up when I was 14,
so I could pass for 17.

534
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:04,066
- Then, by the time I was 17...
- Never mind.

535
00:52:06,268 --> 00:52:08,623
I don't wanna hear about it.

536
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,988
- This coat looks ridiculous.
- Well, have it fixed.

537
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:16,702
Just take it into Maurice the tailor.

538
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:20,618
All right, but I won't wear the hat.

539
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:23,182
But you have to. It all goes together.

540
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:26,857
The suit, the hat, the glasses.
For when you go to the racetrack.

541
00:52:26,988 --> 00:52:31,265
The racetrack? Who's got time for
the racetrack? I gotta get myself a job.

542
00:52:31,387 --> 00:52:35,175
- What do you mean, a job?
- I can find something around the market.

543
00:52:35,307 --> 00:52:38,505
Unloadin' trucks, cleanin' the stalls or...

544
00:52:38,627 --> 00:52:40,983
<i>- What's the matter?</i>

545
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:50,022
Did I say somethin' wrong?

546
00:52:51,227 --> 00:52:54,936
- You're trying to make me feel cheap.
- Cheap?

547
00:52:55,068 --> 00:52:57,900
How would it look if I let you go to work?

548
00:52:58,028 --> 00:53:01,815
D'you want the other girls to think
I can't support my man?

549
00:53:01,947 --> 00:53:05,065
I want you to be better dressed
than anybody else.

550
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:08,975
I want you to have more money in
your pockets. I wanna be proud of you.

551
00:53:09,107 --> 00:53:12,702
But, Irma, you don't understand.
I never felt like this about anybody...

552
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:17,822
That's why I'm gonna work twice as hard
for you as I ever did for any of the others.

553
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:32,302
Your turn.

554
00:53:33,147 --> 00:53:35,103
Hey, Tiger.

555
00:53:46,386 --> 00:53:50,539
I don't feel like playin' any more.
Get somebody else.

556
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:58,857
- Give me a drink.
- Cognac? Pernod? Calvados?

557
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,625
Yeah, and in that order.

558
00:54:01,746 --> 00:54:04,055
Why don't you shut
that damn jukebox off?

559
00:54:04,186 --> 00:54:07,019
What's the problem?
You've got a gold mine working for you.

560
00:54:07,147 --> 00:54:10,104
- And shut yourself off, too.
- Say, I'm lookin' for Irma.

561
00:54:10,226 --> 00:54:13,183
- The one with the bow-wow?
- She's not here. Go away.

562
00:54:13,305 --> 00:54:15,422
I've been away: Tangiers, Naples, Cairo.

563
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:19,505
I met up with a lotta dames,
but there's nothing like that Irma.

564
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:22,060
- Get outta here.
- What is this?

565
00:54:22,186 --> 00:54:27,179
I know about you. You're the one with
Brigitte Bardot tattooed on your chest.

566
00:54:28,106 --> 00:54:30,062
Hey, you crazy?

567
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:39,098
- She must know two sailors.
- A hell of a way to treat a customer.

568
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:41,261
I'm so jealous I'm goin' outta my mind.

569
00:54:41,385 --> 00:54:45,458
<i>You must be. A mac falling in love
with his poule. You're like an impresario.</i>

570
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:48,622
You're handling Pavlova and
you want her to dance just for you?

571
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:53,296
It's a God-given talent. It was
meant to be shared with the public.

572
00:54:54,185 --> 00:54:55,937
Again.

573
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:03,777
- Hey! There's the bow-wow!
- Come on, sailor, keep rowing.

574
00:55:10,945 --> 00:55:14,061
Whew! What a night! Everybody
seems to have the same idea.

575
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:17,336
Always happens when there's a full moon.
No time to catch my breath.

576
00:55:17,464 --> 00:55:19,421
- How's my baby?
- I'm fine.

577
00:55:19,545 --> 00:55:22,297
No, he isn't. As a matter of fact,
he's very grouchy.

578
00:55:22,425 --> 00:55:25,462
We can fix that.
I have a little present for you.

579
00:55:25,586 --> 00:55:28,019
- What is it?
- A stick pin. You put it in your tie.

580
00:55:28,144 --> 00:55:29,783
- I don't need it.
- Yes, you do.

581
00:55:29,905 --> 00:55:32,816
Mimi got Casablanca Charlie one.
This one has real sapphires.

582
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:34,776
- Let's go.
- Go where?

583
00:55:34,905 --> 00:55:36,860
- Home.
- It's only one o'clock.

584
00:55:36,984 --> 00:55:39,545
Pack of Gitanes.
You know I never quit before five.

585
00:55:39,665 --> 00:55:43,180
- Take the night off.
- Just walk off the job, just like that?

586
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:46,819
- Disappoint all my regulars?
- To hell with them!

587
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:49,219
Why don't we go away
somewhere for a week?

588
00:55:49,344 --> 00:55:51,494
A week? What are we gonna live on?

589
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:54,092
If I stay away that long, I'll lose my spot.

590
00:55:54,224 --> 00:55:57,580
- She's got the best location.
- We never have any time together.

591
00:55:57,704 --> 00:56:00,537
You're out there all night,
you sleep all day.

592
00:56:00,665 --> 00:56:04,260
If only Monsieur Camembert were
still around. You remember him?

593
00:56:04,384 --> 00:56:07,898
- Do I? Big spender.
- Who is Monsieur Camembert?

594
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:12,852
That's what we called him. He was
a cheese wholesaler at the market.

595
00:56:12,984 --> 00:56:16,260
He used to see me twice a week,
always gave me 500 francs...

596
00:56:16,384 --> 00:56:20,582
<i>... so I didn't have to see anybody else.
I had lots of time then.</i>

597
00:56:20,704 --> 00:56:24,094
I went to cooking school,
I knitted sweaters, played solitaire.

598
00:56:24,223 --> 00:56:26,260
He was such a nice man.

599
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,499
What happened to him?

600
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:30,932
His wife died,
so he stopped coming around.

601
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:33,419
It was a great loss to all of us.

602
00:56:34,264 --> 00:56:38,052
Hey, girls. Here comes
another busload of tourists.

603
00:56:43,464 --> 00:56:46,456
Irma... stay here.

604
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:50,862
You're sweet. Kiss me.

605
00:56:55,423 --> 00:56:58,938
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe you're right. I'm gonna give it up.

606
00:56:59,064 --> 00:57:00,815
You are?

607
00:57:00,943 --> 00:57:05,333
I promise you, this is absolutely
the last pack I'll ever smoke.

608
00:57:06,622 --> 00:57:09,342
<i>- All right, we're going.</i>

609
00:57:09,463 --> 00:57:11,418
See you later.

610
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:16,701
Must be German tourists.
Short leather pants.

611
00:57:16,823 --> 00:57:21,100
Shut up! Tourists, sailors, wholesalers!
I'd like to kill 'em all.

612
00:57:21,223 --> 00:57:25,135
- Listen to him, Jack the Ripper.
- What am I gonna do?

613
00:57:25,262 --> 00:57:30,017
Suppose there was just one man,
a rich customer who gave her 500 francs.

614
00:57:30,143 --> 00:57:32,178
- Would that make you any happier?
- No.

615
00:57:32,302 --> 00:57:34,657
Maybe it would make me
a little less miserable.

616
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:37,774
How about Monsieur Barnathan,
the goose-liver king?

617
00:57:37,903 --> 00:57:40,655
That nasty old man with the gout?
She wouldn't like it.

618
00:57:40,782 --> 00:57:44,776
Monsieur Leonelli, owns six restaurants,
comes every morning to do the market?

619
00:57:44,903 --> 00:57:47,780
- I don't know him.
- A tall young man, very good-looking.

620
00:57:47,902 --> 00:57:49,858
<i>I wouldn't like it.</i>

621
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:56,456
What about one of those
Englishmen who drop in here?

622
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,015
You know, Rolls-Royce,
Oxford, Coldstream Guards.

623
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:02,815
- They're harmless enough.
- You don't understand.

624
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:06,093
I don't want anybody
to make love to her, except me.

625
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:08,372
Sentimental slob.

626
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:15,572
<i>I say there, old chap, I'addition.</i>

627
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:18,261
That's two onion soups,
a bottle of wine, 15 francs.

628
00:58:18,382 --> 00:58:20,942
Capital onion soup, capital.

629
00:58:21,061 --> 00:58:24,691
Pity we don't have rubber pockets,
we could smuggle some back to London.

630
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,377
An Englishman?

631
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:36,576
Maybe that wouldn't be such a bad idea.

632
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:38,930
- It's worth a try. I say, there!
- No, no, no.

633
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:40,130
No?

634
00:58:40,261 --> 00:58:44,699
Listen, Moustache, would you lend me
500 francs? That's the perfect solution.

635
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:48,212
You give me the money, I give it to Irma,
Irma gives it back to me...

636
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:50,980
...and I give it back to you. It's very simple.

637
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:52,693
- What?
- Don't you see?

638
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:56,609
Irma's going to have a rich lover
and it's going to be me.

639
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:59,457
- You're mad.
- Yes, I'm mad!

640
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:04,053
I'm desperate. This is the only way out,
and you're gonna help me.

641
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:11,057
<i>Let's hear it again.</i>

642
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,570
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

643
00:59:14,701 --> 00:59:17,578
- No, no, through the nose.
- The rain in Spain...

644
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:19,259
And show me some teeth.

645
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:22,736
The rain in Spain stays
mainly in the plain.

646
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:24,930
- By George, you haven't got it.
- I haven't?

647
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,814
Well, to a lord, you wouldn't be
a lord, but maybe to Irma.

648
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:30,660
Don't worry, I've seen
every English movie in town.

649
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,170
- Hold still, Your Lordship.
- Tell me once more, where is my castle?

650
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,054
- In... in... Worcestershire?
- No, that's the sauce. In Yorkshire.

651
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,615
- I thought that was a pudding.
- I've done all I can.

652
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,301
Well, let's see. Homburg, umbrella.

653
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,969
<i>- Where's my 500 francs?
- You mean, my 500 francs.</i>

654
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:51,093
- Thank you, old chip.
- Not old chip, old chap!

655
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,938
- And not that way. On the lift.
- On the what?

656
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,016
The elevator!

657
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,653
Now then, shall we have a go at it?

658
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,974
This may be the biggest setback
for the British since Dunkirk.

659
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,536
I know, I was there.
Last man to be evacuated.

660
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,015
But that's another story.

661
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:06,888
Hello, Uncle. Lookin' for a little fun?

662
01:01:07,018 --> 01:01:09,612
<i>- Quite.
- Am I your type?</i>

663
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:12,571
Not quite. Cheerio, old chip.

664
01:01:12,698 --> 01:01:16,977
- Got the time, mister?
- Indeed, but not the inclination.

665
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:22,055
- Good show.
- Anything I can do for you?

666
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,171
No, thank you. Just browsing.

667
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:35,773
I say, there, would you call
that a miniature or a toy?

668
01:01:35,898 --> 01:01:38,651
That's not a toy. That's a real live dog.

669
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,134
- I have a dog myself.
- A poodle?

670
01:01:41,258 --> 01:01:45,934
No. The hound of the Baskervilles.
Magnificent beast.

671
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:49,767
- But then again, so are you.
- You must be British.

672
01:01:49,898 --> 01:01:54,130
Terribly so. Rolls-Royce, you know,
Oxford, Coldcream Guards.

673
01:01:54,258 --> 01:01:57,056
Tell me, are you booked?

674
01:01:57,178 --> 01:02:00,533
- No.
- In that case... I mean, would you...?

675
01:02:00,658 --> 01:02:04,094
- That is, could we...?
- Why not?

676
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:31,456
- What did you say your name was?
- Irma. They call me Irma la Douce.

677
01:02:31,578 --> 01:02:35,855
Well, if you don't mind, Miss la Douce,
I'd rather not introduce myself.

678
01:02:35,978 --> 01:02:38,650
- I don't mind.
- In my situation a man must be discreet.

679
01:02:38,778 --> 01:02:43,168
- You may call me... Lord X.
- Lord X. Sure.

680
01:02:43,298 --> 01:02:46,527
No, no, no, no, no, my dear,
that shan't be necessary.

681
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:48,807
What's the matter?

682
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:52,452
All I really want is
a bit of companionship...

683
01:02:52,577 --> 01:02:56,411
...a shoulder to cry on,
a smile to lean against.

684
01:03:00,018 --> 01:03:03,168
Say, what does that
X stand for, eccentric?

685
01:03:04,857 --> 01:03:10,090
Let me ask you something, my dear.
Do you find me repulsive?

686
01:03:10,217 --> 01:03:13,891
No, not at all. You're rather nice-looking,
for a lord your age.

687
01:03:14,017 --> 01:03:17,248
Thank you. You see,
my wife, Lady X, she does.

688
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:19,207
- Does what?
- Finds me repulsive.

689
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,851
Ignores me completely. Spends
all of her time cultivating the garden.

690
01:03:22,976 --> 01:03:26,685
And what's worse...
cultivating the gardener.

691
01:03:27,456 --> 01:03:30,573
- The gardener?
- The other day I was watching them...

692
01:03:30,696 --> 01:03:32,652
...from the turret of the castle.

693
01:03:32,777 --> 01:03:35,449
They were in the flower bed together...

694
01:03:35,576 --> 01:03:40,491
...and he was pruning her begonias.
- They oughta be ashamed.

695
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:44,767
Yes, and it was such a jolly marriage,
those first few years.

696
01:03:44,896 --> 01:03:51,085
We'd sit in front of the fire and play
double solitaire and Chinese chequers.

697
01:03:51,216 --> 01:03:53,251
Solitaire? I play solitaire.

698
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:55,172
Capital! Could we?

699
01:03:55,295 --> 01:03:58,653
That is, uh, would you? I mean, shall we?

700
01:03:59,855 --> 01:04:02,165
I don't care, as long as
you're paying for my time.

701
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:05,765
Don't worry about the money.
You take the red, I'll take the blue, hm?

702
01:04:05,896 --> 01:04:10,208
I once knew a gentleman and all he'd
do is scatter some marbles on the floor...

703
01:04:10,336 --> 01:04:12,566
...and make me
pick them up with my toes.

704
01:04:12,696 --> 01:04:14,651
How odd.

705
01:04:15,335 --> 01:04:21,251
- I never played double solitaire before.
- We play off on each other's aces, hm?

706
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:30,134
The rain in Spain stays
mainly in the plain, you know.

707
01:04:30,256 --> 01:04:32,974
- No, I didn't know.
- Hm, it's a fact.

708
01:04:33,095 --> 01:04:38,567
That's where I met my wife,
in Spain, in the rain, in the plain.

709
01:04:38,694 --> 01:04:41,368
I was stationed in Gibraltar.

710
01:04:41,975 --> 01:04:45,763
- Your wife, Lady X, is she beautiful?
- Very, and very passionate.

711
01:04:45,895 --> 01:04:48,125
So I can't really blame her.

712
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:52,534
You see, I came back
from the war a shattered man.

713
01:04:52,654 --> 01:04:56,283
- I was wondering about your eye.
- Oh, bit of detached retina.

714
01:04:56,415 --> 01:05:00,169
Happened at Navarone. Those beastly
guns popping off all the time.

715
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:03,970
I have a silver plate in this elbow.
Sink the Bismarck, that was.

716
01:05:04,095 --> 01:05:09,009
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I have one eye, one elbow, it's not tragic.

717
01:05:10,294 --> 01:05:13,207
What is tragic, however...

718
01:05:13,335 --> 01:05:16,805
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Well, if you'd rather not.

719
01:05:16,934 --> 01:05:20,291
I was in a Japanese prison camp
on the River Kwai.

720
01:05:20,774 --> 01:05:24,369
There was a rather nasty explosion.

721
01:05:24,494 --> 01:05:28,328
Whole ruddy bridge fell down on me.

722
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:37,083
When they dug me up, I was
only half a man, a hollow shell.

723
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:44,012
- You've been through a lot, haven't you?
- Well, mad dogs and Englishmen, eh?

724
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:49,572
With Lawrence in Arabia, with
Sherpa Tenzing up the Himalayas.

725
01:05:49,855 --> 01:05:53,210
And then there was
the charge of the Light Brigade.

726
01:05:53,334 --> 01:05:55,893
India, you know. Gunga Din, eh?

727
01:05:56,013 --> 01:05:58,482
Bengal Lancers. Ta, ta!

728
01:05:58,613 --> 01:06:01,082
Served under Commander Whitehead.

729
01:06:01,214 --> 01:06:04,410
And then there was the RAF and the BBC.

730
01:06:04,534 --> 01:06:08,209
Ah! Dunkirk! Ha-ha!
But that's another story.

731
01:06:26,493 --> 01:06:28,848
- Say, have you seen Irma around?
- No.

732
01:06:28,973 --> 01:06:31,441
She went up at midnight
and hasn't come down yet.

733
01:06:31,573 --> 01:06:33,928
- That's six hours.
- You should have seen the guy.

734
01:06:34,053 --> 01:06:38,331
He was an old goat with a beard. I didn't
even think he'd make it up the stairs.

735
01:06:43,573 --> 01:06:46,849
- Ah, by George, I've done it again.
- One more.

736
01:06:46,973 --> 01:06:48,929
Oh, I'm afraid not.

737
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:51,922
Oh.

738
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:56,045
I'd better dash to the airport
if I'm not to miss my plane.

739
01:06:56,173 --> 01:06:59,802
- It was rather fun, for a change.
- Oh, thank you.

740
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,889
There you are, my dear.

741
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:04,522
Oh!

742
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:08,532
- You're very generous.
- Oh, not really. Just filthy rich.

743
01:07:09,332 --> 01:07:10,970
Um...

744
01:07:11,092 --> 01:07:13,084
How often do you come to Paris?

745
01:07:13,212 --> 01:07:15,806
Twice a week. Why?

746
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:18,002
Well, maybe we could do it again.

747
01:07:18,132 --> 01:07:21,488
Smashing. I was about to suggest
we make some kind of arrangement.

748
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:23,604
I'd like that, and so would Nestor.

749
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:26,246
- Yeah... uh, who?
- The man I live with.

750
01:07:26,372 --> 01:07:27,521
Oh.

751
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:33,727
He doesn't mind that you come up here
with strangers and pick up their marbles?

752
01:07:33,852 --> 01:07:36,047
No. Why should he? Business is business.

753
01:07:36,173 --> 01:07:39,848
- Sensible attitude.
- Only thing he objects to is my smoking.

754
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,724
I'm trying to quit, but it isn't easy.

755
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:46,326
Then you must really love him?

756
01:07:50,412 --> 01:07:53,768
- Shall we go?
- Just a second. Where's my other shoe?

757
01:07:53,892 --> 01:07:55,688
- Hm?
- My other shoe?

758
01:07:55,812 --> 01:07:57,325
Oh, hm. Er...

759
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:00,728
I'm sorry, I really must catch my plane...

760
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:04,003
...or Lady X and that wretched
gardener will be running amok.

761
01:08:04,131 --> 01:08:07,123
- See you Thursday, same place?
- I'll be waiting.

762
01:08:10,931 --> 01:08:12,887
Cheeribye.

763
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:16,649
Whee!

764
01:08:16,771 --> 01:08:20,047
This is our lucky night.
Wait till I tell Nestor.

765
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:24,521
All right, what did you do with my shoe?

766
01:08:33,491 --> 01:08:36,211
Would you give this
to the young lady in room nine?

767
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:40,802
Somehow it wound up in my pocket.

768
01:08:40,931 --> 01:08:42,489
Old goat.

769
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:44,728
- How did it go?
- You would have been proud of me.

770
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,966
What a performance!
Like Sir Laurence Oliver.

771
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:50,207
<i>That's Laurence Olivier.
And watch your ascot.</i>

772
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:52,286
My what?

773
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:54,448
<i>Nestor!</i>

774
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:57,246
Nestor! Nestor!

775
01:09:57,369 --> 01:09:59,725
It happened! We hit the jackpot!

776
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:01,919
- Whee!
- What happened? What jackpot?

777
01:10:02,049 --> 01:10:05,724
I found him, and he's got a castle
and he comes here twice a week.

778
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:08,603
- Who? Calm down.
- He's English and he's a lord.

779
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:11,402
I'm gonna see him again
on Thursday and he's filthy rich.

780
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:13,679
- Know how much he gave me?
- How would I know?

781
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,925
Come on, make a guess.

782
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:18,006
500 francs!

783
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:22,162
- Here.
- How about that?

784
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:25,240
500 francs? What'd ya have to do for it?

785
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:27,121
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on.

786
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,399
- He taught me a new game.
- What kind of game?

787
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:31,724
- He beat me nine times...
- That's more like it.

788
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:37,286
He used to play with his wife, but she's
got something goin' with the gardener.

789
01:10:37,409 --> 01:10:39,365
It's 500 francs, all right.

790
01:10:39,488 --> 01:10:41,718
Later.

791
01:10:43,048 --> 01:10:45,357
Hey, Tiger, can we see ya for a minute?

792
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:47,763
Certainly. What's on your mind, boys?

793
01:10:47,888 --> 01:10:49,924
Congratulations, you made it.

794
01:10:50,809 --> 01:10:53,641
- I didn't do anything.
- Me and the boys have talked it over.

795
01:10:53,769 --> 01:10:57,000
Since you're numero uno now,
we've elected you president.

796
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,485
- President? Of what?
- Local 27 of the MPPA.

797
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:04,602
<i>- MPP...?
- Macs of Paris Protective Association.</i>

798
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:06,684
- Me?
- It was unanimous.

799
01:11:07,608 --> 01:11:10,806
It's an honour. I'm sure you can
find somebody more deserving...

800
01:11:10,928 --> 01:11:13,886
We accept! Oh, I'm so proud of you.

801
01:11:14,889 --> 01:11:17,038
Champagne for everybody!

802
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,324
Hey! Free champagne!

803
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:46,640
<i>Vive Nestor!</i>

804
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:49,725
<i>Vive! Vive! Vive!</i>

805
01:12:02,727 --> 01:12:06,687
Oh, I'm so happy. From now on
it's just going to be the three of us -

806
01:12:06,808 --> 01:12:09,879
- you and me and the lord.
- Yeah.

807
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:16,005
Let's see. 500 francs each time, that's
1,000 francs a week, 52 weeks a year...

808
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,436
...so that would be...

809
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:22,526
- Darling, can I have 100 francs?
- Oh, sure.

810
01:12:22,646 --> 01:12:26,641
- It's for a hair dryer.
- Here's another 100. Get curtains too.

811
01:12:26,767 --> 01:12:29,918
- Why are you so good to me?
- I just believe in fair dealings...

812
01:12:30,047 --> 01:12:32,436
...between labour and management.

813
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:47,161
<i>Come on, Nestor. Le twist.</i>

814
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:50,756
Hands off, Lolita. He doesn't
twist with anybody but me.

815
01:12:50,887 --> 01:12:53,195
Get her. Mrs President.

816
01:12:54,046 --> 01:12:56,003
Uh... let's dance.

817
01:14:16,645 --> 01:14:19,603
- Want to pay for the champagne now?
- I didn't order it.

818
01:14:19,724 --> 01:14:23,843
The president always pays when
he's inaugurated. 270 francs, please.

819
01:14:23,965 --> 01:14:27,196
Nine bottles.
Eight for the gang, one for her.

820
01:14:27,325 --> 01:14:31,203
- She had a whole bottle?
- How d'you think she got kidney stones?

821
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:34,877
Well, that went fast.

822
01:14:35,445 --> 01:14:37,401
<i>Now, what about my 500?</i>

823
01:14:38,324 --> 01:14:40,475
This isn't workin' out the way we figured.

824
01:14:40,605 --> 01:14:43,915
The way you figured. I told you
it was economically unsound.

825
01:14:44,044 --> 01:14:48,276
You'll just have to advance Lord X another
500, when he comes back on Thursday.

826
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:51,681
- Oh, no, not me.
- Well, how am I gonna pay Irma?

827
01:14:51,805 --> 01:14:56,161
I guess you'll just have to mortgage your
castle, pick some pockets or rob a bank.

828
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:59,674
I knocked over a bank in Bordeaux -
my father's - but that's another...

829
01:14:59,805 --> 01:15:01,760
Shut up.

830
01:15:02,725 --> 01:15:06,239
Bit of a sticky wicket,
isn't it, Your Lordship?

831
01:15:53,643 --> 01:15:55,599
<i>Irma?</i>

832
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:06,279
Irma?

833
01:16:52,602 --> 01:16:54,558
Come on.

834
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:26,274
Good morning, darling.

835
01:21:26,397 --> 01:21:28,628
- Good morning.
- Did I wake you?

836
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:30,475
No.

837
01:21:30,597 --> 01:21:32,110
Ooh.

838
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:34,593
Oh, it looks like a beautiful day.

839
01:21:36,077 --> 01:21:39,911
I feel so spoiled and so lazy.

840
01:21:40,037 --> 01:21:42,915
Do you realise I don't have
a thing to do until Thursday?

841
01:21:43,038 --> 01:21:45,472
- What's Thursday?
- When Lord X comes again.

842
01:21:45,597 --> 01:21:46,586
Oh. Oh!

843
01:21:46,717 --> 01:21:50,676
You know what let's do? Let's rent
a tandem and ride out to the country.

844
01:21:50,797 --> 01:21:53,834
- Trees and grass and fresh air.
- Not today.

845
01:21:53,957 --> 01:21:56,424
Or we could go to the Bois
and row around the lake.

846
01:21:56,557 --> 01:21:57,956
Maybe next week.

847
01:21:58,077 --> 01:22:01,626
We don't have to do anything.
We could stay in bed all day.

848
01:22:01,757 --> 01:22:03,713
I'd like that.

849
01:22:07,317 --> 01:22:10,388
- Want your breakfast now or later?
- Much later.

850
01:22:16,717 --> 01:22:18,672
I've got a surprise for you.

851
01:22:19,877 --> 01:22:22,471
- Close your eyes.
- Thank you.

852
01:22:26,397 --> 01:22:29,752
When I was at the department store,
buying the curtains, I saw this.

853
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:32,913
And you know how I feel
about green, so I tried it on.

854
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:35,870
There was a riot.
Three of the salesmen got trampled...

855
01:22:35,997 --> 01:22:38,715
...so naturally I just had to have it.

856
01:22:38,836 --> 01:22:42,988
Now, don't open your eyes yet.
I want you to see it against the light.

857
01:22:45,157 --> 01:22:47,512
All right, you can look now.

858
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:51,633
Nestor?

859
01:22:54,876 --> 01:22:56,832
Nestor.

860
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:03,665
- Nestor!
- Not today.

861
01:23:03,796 --> 01:23:05,752
Maybe next week?

862
01:23:08,995 --> 01:23:11,146
All right.

863
01:23:11,275 --> 01:23:13,630
If that's the way you feel about it.

864
01:24:24,194 --> 01:24:27,470
- My dear girl.
- I was afraid you wouldn't show up.

865
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:33,385
Almost didn't. Ran into dirty weather over
the Channel. Unusually foggy for July.

866
01:24:39,755 --> 01:24:42,666
- What is it, my dear?
- You've changed somehow.

867
01:24:42,794 --> 01:24:45,103
Have I? How?

868
01:24:45,835 --> 01:24:49,144
That patch, shouldn't it be
on the other eye?

869
01:24:49,275 --> 01:24:51,230
Oh.

870
01:24:51,635 --> 01:24:54,706
Indeed. Well, no wonder it was so foggy.

871
01:24:57,753 --> 01:25:03,147
- I've been practising. I'll be much better.
- Oh, let's get at it then, shall we?

872
01:25:06,274 --> 01:25:08,230
Old goat.

873
01:25:21,434 --> 01:25:24,471
How are things at home?
I mean, how's Lady X?

874
01:25:24,594 --> 01:25:28,109
- Her usual self.
- How's the gardener?

875
01:25:28,673 --> 01:25:32,109
Finally happened. Caught them
red-handed in the greenhouse.

876
01:25:32,234 --> 01:25:36,113
I threw them out, pulled up the
drawbridge, started divorce proceedings.

877
01:25:36,234 --> 01:25:38,668
- That's too bad.
- Catastrophe.

878
01:25:38,793 --> 01:25:41,432
Best damn gardener I ever had.

879
01:25:42,473 --> 01:25:44,510
Must be lonely for you at the castle.

880
01:25:44,633 --> 01:25:48,070
Very. Especially at night,
just me and the family ghost...

881
01:25:48,192 --> 01:25:51,469
...spooking around those 96 rooms.

882
01:25:51,594 --> 01:25:54,790
- How many?
- Not to mention the 400 acres...

883
01:25:54,913 --> 01:25:58,349
...and the croquet field,
and the trout hatchery.

884
01:25:58,474 --> 01:26:03,466
And all the horses. I breed trotters
and pacers. Separate stables, you know.

885
01:26:04,273 --> 01:26:07,310
I imagine there must be lots
of trees and grass and a brook.

886
01:26:07,433 --> 01:26:11,551
And swans and peacocks and... unicorns.

887
01:26:12,273 --> 01:26:17,347
It sounds like a wonderful place for
Coquette. I'd like to get her out of the city.

888
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,781
- She drinks, you know.
- Really?

889
01:26:20,273 --> 01:26:22,912
I keep finding empty
bottles under the bed.

890
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:24,581
Well...

891
01:26:24,712 --> 01:26:27,591
Love to invite you to the castle,
both of you...

892
01:26:27,713 --> 01:26:32,343
...but I'm sure you wouldn't dream
of leaving your young man.

893
01:26:34,112 --> 01:26:36,068
No, I guess not.

894
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:40,629
- Although sometimes I wonder.
- Is something troubling you?

895
01:26:40,753 --> 01:26:44,188
Well, suddenly he seems so different.
I mean, so indifferent.

896
01:26:44,313 --> 01:26:47,907
He's tired all the time,
not interested in me at all.

897
01:26:48,032 --> 01:26:50,705
I'm sure there must be some explanation.

898
01:26:50,832 --> 01:26:53,062
I'm beginning to think
he's got another girl.

899
01:26:53,192 --> 01:26:56,867
That's ridiculous! Why would
anybody with a... girl like you...

900
01:26:56,993 --> 01:26:59,790
Somebody ought to give
that young man a good talking to.

901
01:26:59,912 --> 01:27:02,710
- Would you like to meet him?
- Meet him?

902
01:27:02,992 --> 01:27:05,187
He's waiting for me across the street.

903
01:27:05,312 --> 01:27:07,950
I really ought to be getting to the airport.

904
01:27:08,072 --> 01:27:11,064
Oh, it'll only take a minute.
Come on. We'll buy you a drink.

905
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:15,469
Thank you, but no thank you.
I mean, while I'm getting my divorce...

906
01:27:15,591 --> 01:27:17,981
...we really shouldn't be
seen with each other.

907
01:27:18,112 --> 01:27:22,627
Yes. Yes, you must be careful. Maybe we
shouldn't even leave the hotel together.

908
01:27:22,752 --> 01:27:27,666
Capital suggestion. Shall we
rendezvous again next Monday, hm?

909
01:27:27,791 --> 01:27:29,748
Of course.

910
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:32,546
Oh, I don't feel right about this.

911
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:37,390
It's taking money under false pretences.

912
01:27:37,511 --> 01:27:40,947
- After all, I don't do anything for you.
- Balderdash.

913
01:27:41,071 --> 01:27:45,587
Why, if it weren't for this arrangement
of ours, I should go through the ceiling.

914
01:27:45,711 --> 01:27:48,145
Of course, it must be very boring for you.

915
01:27:48,271 --> 01:27:50,226
Not at all. I enjoy it.

916
01:27:50,351 --> 01:27:52,070
Oh.

917
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:54,751
You've made me a very happy man.

918
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:57,860
Half-man, I should say.

919
01:27:59,431 --> 01:28:01,387
Well, ta-ta...

920
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:06,781
...toodle-oo, and tally-ho.

921
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:17,064
Up. Get up, you lush.

922
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:21,025
Look at those circles under your eyes.

923
01:28:21,151 --> 01:28:25,349
Carry on like this, and we'll
have to have your face lifted.

924
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:37,349
Say, you're the Englishman
that's seeing Irma.

925
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:40,985
- I don't believe we've been introduced.
- I'm Hippolyte the Ox.

926
01:28:41,111 --> 01:28:43,066
What is on your mind, Mr Ox?

927
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:47,661
I just thought if you were interested
in something new, more unusual...

928
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:51,783
- Twins, you know.
- What, and play three-handed solitaire?

929
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:53,866
No, thanks.

930
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:20,500
Order!

931
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:23,303
Come on, everybody! It's getting late!

932
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:25,819
- Let's take a vote.
- All right.

933
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:29,989
The motion on the floor is that every girl
contributes one day's earnings a week...

934
01:29:30,109 --> 01:29:33,146
...toward our pension fund.
All those in favour?

935
01:29:33,269 --> 01:29:35,226
<i>- Aye!
- Aye!</i>

936
01:29:37,069 --> 01:29:39,024
Carried unanimously.

937
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:42,107
OK, girls, let's have it.

938
01:29:49,428 --> 01:29:52,705
- I'm back, Nestor.
- Hi. Ooh, that was a rough meeting.

939
01:29:52,829 --> 01:29:55,138
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

940
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:57,666
Thank you.

941
01:29:57,788 --> 01:30:00,906
- What's that for?
- You just voted for it. The pension fund.

942
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:02,620
Huh?

943
01:30:02,749 --> 01:30:04,784
Just part of my programme.

944
01:30:04,909 --> 01:30:09,266
Now that I'm president, I'm gonna
get this organisation movin' ahead.

945
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:16,141
- How did it go with His Lordship?
- Fine. I'm beginning to like him a lot.

946
01:30:16,269 --> 01:30:19,738
It's a good thing the bridge fell on him,
I might be jealous. Cognac.

947
01:30:19,868 --> 01:30:21,938
Pernod for me. Nothing for her.

948
01:30:22,069 --> 01:30:25,345
He's getting a divorce, so maybe now
he can see me more often.

949
01:30:25,468 --> 01:30:28,540
More often? I doubt it.
Where would he get the money?

950
01:30:28,669 --> 01:30:30,943
Well, he's got this big estate.

951
01:30:31,068 --> 01:30:33,343
You know what the taxes are in England?

952
01:30:33,468 --> 01:30:37,699
Why, some of those lords
have to scrounge around for a living.

953
01:30:43,547 --> 01:30:47,621
If he saw me three times a week,
that's 1500 francs.

954
01:30:47,748 --> 01:30:49,704
I could buy you a car.

955
01:30:50,587 --> 01:30:56,538
A sports model. Kiki thinks she's such
a hotshot cos she got her guy a scooter.

956
01:30:56,667 --> 01:31:00,581
Just wait till they see you drivin' up
and down the street with the top down.

957
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:04,542
- And I'll get you a little cap to go with it.
- What are you doing?

958
01:31:05,547 --> 01:31:08,585
- He's trying to get the lipstick off.
- Lipstick?

959
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:10,903
- Where did that come from?
- Good question.

960
01:31:11,027 --> 01:31:12,984
- It must have been you.
- That's it.

961
01:31:13,107 --> 01:31:16,258
Me? I was in the hotel with His Lordship.

962
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:18,537
That's not it.

963
01:31:18,667 --> 01:31:21,784
Oh, yes, I was at the board meeting,
we were takin' a vote...

964
01:31:21,908 --> 01:31:24,296
...and one of the girls
was doin' a little lobbyin'.

965
01:31:24,426 --> 01:31:29,296
- That must be it.
- Which girl was doing a little lobbying?

966
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:34,743
Come on, Tiger, how about it?

967
01:31:38,987 --> 01:31:41,023
Hey, you dropped something.

968
01:31:41,347 --> 01:31:43,338
Where?

969
01:31:43,467 --> 01:31:45,423
There.

970
01:31:52,586 --> 01:31:55,863
Oh, uh, now, please.
Look, girls, this is ridic...

971
01:32:04,787 --> 01:32:07,142
Now, I'm the president here. Uh-oh.

972
01:32:12,227 --> 01:32:15,697
Well, that's enough.
Let's shake hands and make up, hm?

973
01:32:16,867 --> 01:32:18,823
Oh, why...?

974
01:32:22,066 --> 01:32:24,022
Girls!

975
01:32:34,626 --> 01:32:36,582
Oh, no. You wouldn't...

976
01:33:21,384 --> 01:33:23,342
Agh!

977
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:07,214
Good morning, Tiger. How about
some breakfast? Fresh croissants?

978
01:34:07,344 --> 01:34:10,222
- I better get back before she wakes up.
- You look terrible.

979
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:13,974
- You must have lost 10 pounds.
- 15. I weighed myself on the meat scales.

980
01:34:14,104 --> 01:34:18,177
What do you expect? Loading, unloading,
in the window, out the window...

981
01:34:18,305 --> 01:34:21,614
...on with the beard, off with the beard.
You're going to fall apart.

982
01:34:21,745 --> 01:34:24,099
I don't care, as long as
I keep her off the streets.

983
01:34:24,225 --> 01:34:26,977
It's a hard way to earn an easy living.

984
01:34:50,344 --> 01:34:52,300
Nestor?

985
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:50,020
You know, Irma, I'm a little bit
disappointed in you.

986
01:35:50,142 --> 01:35:53,259
You promised me
you wouldn't smoke any more.

987
01:35:56,823 --> 01:35:59,257
Aren't you gonna say anything?

988
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:05,211
I suppose you're wondering where I was?

989
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:08,254
- I know where you were.
- You do?

990
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:12,012
- You were out with the boys.
- Yeah, that's right.

991
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:14,703
- Don't lie to me!
- Well, where was I?

992
01:36:14,822 --> 01:36:17,177
You were out with Lolita.

993
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:21,936
That's right.
Let me go to bed. I'm very tired.

994
01:36:22,062 --> 01:36:25,611
- You've been with her every night.
- Oh, no, I haven't.

995
01:36:25,742 --> 01:36:27,778
- No?
- No, not every night.

996
01:36:27,902 --> 01:36:31,451
Sometimes I was with... Amazon Annie...

997
01:36:31,582 --> 01:36:36,702
...and sometimes with Mimi the Maumau,
and sometimes with the twins...

998
01:36:36,822 --> 01:36:39,619
...and... they all want me to handle 'em.

999
01:36:41,062 --> 01:36:43,417
So I've decided to branch out, you know.

1000
01:36:43,542 --> 01:36:50,333
Business is business. And don't you
forget, around here, I'm numero uno.

1001
01:36:51,661 --> 01:36:53,492
You make me sick!

1002
01:36:55,781 --> 01:36:58,136
What are you gonna do about it?

1003
01:37:04,061 --> 01:37:06,814
This is what you came with. Now get out!

1004
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:13,734
You're not throwin' me out,
cos you're crazy about me, aren't you?

1005
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:16,535
- Let go!
- Gonna buy me a new car, remember?

1006
01:37:16,661 --> 01:37:18,379
- And a sports cap.
- Let go!

1007
01:37:18,501 --> 01:37:23,622
And when you buy me the sports cap,
I want it with a little strap in the back.

1008
01:37:23,742 --> 01:37:28,735
That's what you'll get from me. Let them
work for you and see how well you do!

1009
01:37:28,861 --> 01:37:32,695
You think you're numero uno?
I'm numero uno!

1010
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:35,938
Go outside on the street
and ask the first man you see.

1011
01:37:36,061 --> 01:37:38,211
Ask anybody!

1012
01:37:51,701 --> 01:37:53,656
I'm sorry, it's...

1013
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:16,050
<i>Here we are in the 7th inning,
two out, Maury Wills on first.</i>

1014
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:20,617
<i>The ball game coming to you direct from
LA, over the American Forces Network.</i>

1015
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:24,733
<i>Marichal on the rubber, into a stretch.
Here's the pitch and there he goes.</i>

1016
01:38:24,859 --> 01:38:29,980
<i>The throw down to second base
is not in time. He's stolen another one.</i>

1017
01:38:51,059 --> 01:38:52,174
Hello.

1018
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:54,894
Here you are. I was afraid
you mightn't show.

1019
01:38:55,020 --> 01:39:00,139
I didn't realise it was so late. I've been
walking the streets all day... thinking.

1020
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:03,410
- There's something I'd like to discuss.
- By all means.

1021
01:39:03,539 --> 01:39:05,689
Not here.

1022
01:39:05,819 --> 01:39:07,970
I don't want Nestor to know.

1023
01:39:08,098 --> 01:39:12,172
Let's not take any chances, hm?
Shall we go up to your office?

1024
01:39:26,459 --> 01:39:30,054
Now then, my dear, what is it
that's so important, hm?

1025
01:39:30,859 --> 01:39:34,932
- Did you mean what you said?
- Indeed. What did I say?

1026
01:39:35,059 --> 01:39:37,653
About taking me to England with you.

1027
01:39:39,059 --> 01:39:41,095
Of course I meant it, if I said it.

1028
01:39:41,218 --> 01:39:44,768
And if you say so,
I must've said it, so I meant it.

1029
01:39:44,899 --> 01:39:45,774
I'm ready.

1030
01:39:45,898 --> 01:39:48,857
But you can't go. What about Nestor,
or whatever his name is?

1031
01:39:48,978 --> 01:39:53,927
Nestor, Hippolyte, it doesn't matter.
Sooner or later, they give you a bad time.

1032
01:39:54,058 --> 01:39:56,857
- The brutes.
- So, if you want me to go with you...

1033
01:39:56,978 --> 01:39:59,367
It's a bit of a sticky wicket.

1034
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:03,371
If it's in any way awkward,
I don't want to embarrass you.

1035
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:06,217
Not at all, my dear. I'd be delighted.

1036
01:40:06,338 --> 01:40:12,607
It's just that... there's this
ghastly servant problem right now.

1037
01:40:12,738 --> 01:40:16,572
The castle's overrun with plumbers,
the moat is leaking.

1038
01:40:16,698 --> 01:40:21,010
Besides, I'm a shattered man.
I'd be of no use to you.

1039
01:40:23,258 --> 01:40:25,295
Are you sure?

1040
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:28,251
As a matter of fact,
I'm on my way to Zurich now.

1041
01:40:28,378 --> 01:40:30,369
I wasn't planning to go to England at all.

1042
01:40:30,498 --> 01:40:33,887
Going to consult
a Swiss doctor, a specialist.

1043
01:40:34,658 --> 01:40:37,889
But that's a waste of time.
They can't help you.

1044
01:40:38,018 --> 01:40:40,975
I once knew a specialist,
used to send his patients to me.

1045
01:40:41,098 --> 01:40:43,213
- To you?
- The tough cases.

1046
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:46,613
Poor guys. Thought they'd run out of gas,
but they were just stalled.

1047
01:40:46,737 --> 01:40:49,410
- All they needed was a little push.
- A push.

1048
01:40:49,538 --> 01:40:53,086
I mean, mentally.
To stimulate their imagination.

1049
01:40:53,617 --> 01:40:56,336
- It's all up here, you know.
- I wish it were.

1050
01:40:56,457 --> 01:40:58,527
I had one patient given up as hopeless...

1051
01:40:58,657 --> 01:41:01,296
...until I started telling him
about the South Seas.

1052
01:41:01,417 --> 01:41:04,409
The South Seas? What a curious gambit.

1053
01:41:04,537 --> 01:41:06,493
It worked.

1054
01:41:09,457 --> 01:41:11,413
- Lie down.
- I beg your pardon?

1055
01:41:11,537 --> 01:41:13,493
Stretch out, relax.

1056
01:41:15,578 --> 01:41:18,535
Close your eyes. I mean, your eye.

1057
01:41:21,137 --> 01:41:23,526
- No tricks now.
- I promise.

1058
01:41:27,816 --> 01:41:30,377
You're in Tahiti. All right?

1059
01:41:30,497 --> 01:41:34,011
Tahiti? Yes, I've been there
with Captain Bligh.

1060
01:41:34,137 --> 01:41:36,128
Mutiny on the Bounty! Ha-ha!

1061
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:38,213
Down, Lord.

1062
01:41:39,576 --> 01:41:41,532
Now concentrate.

1063
01:41:49,776 --> 01:41:52,654
Palm trees swaying in the breeze...

1064
01:41:53,697 --> 01:41:56,005
...a smell of ripe papayas...

1065
01:41:56,136 --> 01:42:01,256
...a blue lagoon, white sand,
golden-skinned girls.

1066
01:42:02,137 --> 01:42:04,092
Have you got that?

1067
01:42:04,216 --> 01:42:08,687
Blue lagoon, white sand, golden skin.

1068
01:42:09,336 --> 01:42:12,807
- They're beautiful, aren't they?
- Are they ever. Oh...

1069
01:42:12,936 --> 01:42:14,892
How many do you see?

1070
01:42:16,975 --> 01:42:20,970
14, to be exact. They're wearing
grass skirts and coconut shells.

1071
01:42:21,096 --> 01:42:23,212
- No, they're not.
- They're not?

1072
01:42:23,336 --> 01:42:27,408
They're wearing sarongs
and hibiscus blossoms in their hair.

1073
01:42:28,056 --> 01:42:30,012
Oh?

1074
01:42:30,136 --> 01:42:32,524
Yes, by George, you're right.

1075
01:42:33,055 --> 01:42:37,731
Now they take off their sarongs, and they
start washing them in the blue lagoon.

1076
01:42:39,135 --> 01:42:41,092
Indeed. They...

1077
01:42:42,895 --> 01:42:47,014
Look, it's no use. I mean,
I really am out of gas, uh, petrol.

1078
01:42:47,135 --> 01:42:49,206
The tank is completely dry.

1079
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:52,328
All right, let's forget Tahiti. Lie back.

1080
01:42:58,456 --> 01:43:02,050
- You're in Baghdad.
- Baghdad! Now how did I get there?

1081
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:04,131
Shh.

1082
01:43:10,255 --> 01:43:12,325
You're in a bazaar.

1083
01:43:13,695 --> 01:43:17,847
You see an exotic woman,
with a veil across her face.

1084
01:43:17,975 --> 01:43:21,285
Big, black, almond eyes.

1085
01:43:22,056 --> 01:43:24,967
She winks at you. You follow her.

1086
01:43:25,615 --> 01:43:27,890
She disappears into a palace.

1087
01:43:28,015 --> 01:43:32,166
There are two Nubian slaves standing
guard, so you climb over the wall.

1088
01:43:33,174 --> 01:43:35,245
- How high?
- Ten feet.

1089
01:43:35,374 --> 01:43:38,094
- I'll never make it.
- Try, you must try.

1090
01:43:38,215 --> 01:43:42,003
I'm trying. Ow! Broken glass on the top.

1091
01:43:42,134 --> 01:43:44,773
- Are you over?
- Just barely.

1092
01:43:45,575 --> 01:43:47,246
Good.

1093
01:43:47,374 --> 01:43:50,446
Now you're inside the harem.

1094
01:43:51,854 --> 01:43:54,209
You're lying on silk pillows.

1095
01:43:55,134 --> 01:43:58,171
Odalisques are fanning you.

1096
01:43:58,294 --> 01:44:00,887
They're feeding you grapes...

1097
01:44:01,535 --> 01:44:03,889
...painting your toenails...

1098
01:44:04,693 --> 01:44:08,528
...while she does
the dance of the seven veils.

1099
01:44:10,414 --> 01:44:14,248
She takes off... the fourth veil...

1100
01:44:16,055 --> 01:44:18,409
...the fifth...

1101
01:44:18,534 --> 01:44:21,173
...the sixth...

1102
01:44:39,733 --> 01:44:42,611
You will be gentle, won't you?

1103
01:44:58,412 --> 01:45:00,370
Your Lordship!

1104
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:09,653
Are you all right, Your Lordship?

1105
01:45:13,013 --> 01:45:16,722
I will be, as soon as I pull myself together.

1106
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:22,804
You know, I think Lady X
must have been out of her mind.

1107
01:45:22,932 --> 01:45:26,527
With you in the house, why would
she go puttering around in the garden?

1108
01:45:26,652 --> 01:45:28,689
How kind of you to say so.

1109
01:45:28,813 --> 01:45:31,121
What time does our plane
leave for London?

1110
01:45:31,252 --> 01:45:33,209
- Eight o'clock.
- Oh.

1111
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:35,688
I'd better go home and pack.

1112
01:45:36,693 --> 01:45:40,526
Look, I'm afraid I can't take you
to my castle in Worcestershire.

1113
01:45:40,652 --> 01:45:42,801
- Why not?
- Because...

1114
01:45:42,932 --> 01:45:45,766
...I don't have a castle
in Worcestershire.

1115
01:45:45,892 --> 01:45:48,770
Of course not, it's in Yorkshire.

1116
01:45:48,892 --> 01:45:51,725
Quite, but... what I mean to say...

1117
01:45:52,492 --> 01:45:56,041
...I haven't been entirely frank
with you, my dear Irma.

1118
01:45:56,172 --> 01:46:00,211
- You haven't?
- For instance, what I told you about...

1119
01:46:00,892 --> 01:46:04,282
...unicorns. There are no unicorns.

1120
01:46:04,412 --> 01:46:06,368
So what?

1121
01:46:06,492 --> 01:46:10,485
So she'll play with the peacocks. And
don't worry about the servant problem.

1122
01:46:10,612 --> 01:46:15,481
I'll cook for you, I'll serve you tea
in the afternoon, I'll knit you sweaters.

1123
01:46:16,612 --> 01:46:18,568
I can be ready in 20 minutes.

1124
01:46:18,692 --> 01:46:23,811
I'll meet you at the bistro across
the street, Chez Moustache, all right?

1125
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:26,605
Hey, are you there?

1126
01:46:27,252 --> 01:46:30,403
- Your Lordship?
- Yes, I'm there.

1127
01:46:30,532 --> 01:46:32,488
I mean, I'm here.

1128
01:46:33,251 --> 01:46:37,404
And I'll be there. The bistro.

1129
01:46:40,571 --> 01:46:44,007
Oh, and one more thing.
Keep away from Nestor. He's vicious.

1130
01:46:44,131 --> 01:46:46,805
They don't call him Tiger for nothing.

1131
01:47:24,931 --> 01:47:28,321
I say there, this is a bit of a jolly surprise.

1132
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:31,363
- What'll it be, Your Lordship?
- Don't mention that swine.

1133
01:47:31,531 --> 01:47:34,522
Do you know what they've been
doing in that hotel room?

1134
01:47:34,651 --> 01:47:36,606
Shattered man, my eye!

1135
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:40,086
And now they're running off to England -
Irma and the lord.

1136
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:42,360
<i>She's packing.
She's going to walk out on me.</i>

1137
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:44,958
- Nestor.
- He's taking her to his bloody castle.

1138
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:47,365
She's gonna make tea for him,
knit him sweaters.

1139
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:50,243
- You're talking crazy.
- They won't get away with it.

1140
01:47:50,371 --> 01:47:53,567
I'll tear him apart.
I'll... throw him in the Seine.

1141
01:47:53,691 --> 01:47:55,646
Nestor.

1142
01:47:58,729 --> 01:48:00,801
There is no lord.

1143
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:04,284
- There isn't?
- That's right.

1144
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:06,877
How do you like that phoney?
He's been lying to her.

1145
01:48:07,009 --> 01:48:09,570
What do you mean "he"?
There is no "he" - it's you!

1146
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:13,319
Of course it's me, but she doesn't
know that. And she doesn't know I know.

1147
01:48:13,450 --> 01:48:17,045
But I know that she likes him
better than she likes me.

1148
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:19,080
See?

1149
01:48:19,210 --> 01:48:21,963
She wouldn't even
take any money from him.

1150
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:27,640
- I think you'd better have a drink.
- The world isn't big enough for two of us.

1151
01:48:27,770 --> 01:48:31,160
Lord X is gonna walk down
the street and disappear for ever.

1152
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:35,647
- Nobody's ever gonna see him again.
- I didn't want to see him in the first place.

1153
01:48:35,770 --> 01:48:39,444
- Get my other clothes from the cellar.
- Coming up.

1154
01:48:49,489 --> 01:48:54,005
Somebody oughta warn him. He shouldn't
flash all that money around here.

1155
01:48:54,129 --> 01:48:57,918
<i>- He's liable to get hit over the head.
- (both) Are you gonna warn him?</i>

1156
01:48:58,049 --> 01:49:00,801
Me? It's none of my business.

1157
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:06,563
In a way, I'm going to miss you,
Your Lordship.

1158
01:49:06,689 --> 01:49:11,717
Pull yourself together, old chap, hm?
Stiff upper lip and all that. Cheerio.

1159
01:49:14,128 --> 01:49:16,484
One more for the road.

1160
01:49:21,489 --> 01:49:24,049
Jojo, have you got
your blackjack on you?

1161
01:49:24,168 --> 01:49:27,046
Sorry. How about some brass knuckles?

1162
01:51:05,207 --> 01:51:07,515
Goodbye, Your bloody Lordship!

1163
01:51:11,567 --> 01:51:14,364
<i>I hate to see you go,
but c'est la vie, old chap!</i>

1164
01:51:19,646 --> 01:51:21,762
I hope you float back to England...

1165
01:51:21,887 --> 01:51:24,640
...and I hope the fish
eat your bloody liver!

1166
01:52:12,006 --> 01:52:14,565
Hey, police! Police!

1167
01:52:37,365 --> 01:52:39,721
What's the time, Moustache?

1168
01:52:40,485 --> 01:52:43,124
- Five after eight.
- Sure your watch isn't fast?

1169
01:52:43,245 --> 01:52:46,078
Maybe, or maybe whoever
you're waiting for is slow.

1170
01:52:49,085 --> 01:52:53,158
Here you are. Tomorrow at this time you'll
be chasing peacocks across the lawn.

1171
01:52:53,285 --> 01:52:56,242
- Where are you going, anyway?
- I'm going to visit my aunt.

1172
01:52:56,365 --> 01:52:58,719
She lives in Brussels.
That's Belgium, you know.

1173
01:52:58,845 --> 01:53:02,281
Used to be a concert pianist,
but runs an orphanage now.

1174
01:53:02,405 --> 01:53:06,159
Oh, come on, Irma, you can do
better than that. Is that seat taken?

1175
01:53:06,285 --> 01:53:08,799
- Yes.
- Café au lait and a croissant.

1176
01:53:12,164 --> 01:53:17,114
That aunt, could it be she has a beard and
an eye patch and her name is Lord X?

1177
01:53:19,044 --> 01:53:21,878
If that's who you're waiting for,
he's not gonna show up.

1178
01:53:22,004 --> 01:53:24,439
Can't I sit here without
being annoyed by riffraff?

1179
01:53:24,564 --> 01:53:29,240
We get all kinds. Just a while ago,
we had a real live English lord in here.

1180
01:53:29,364 --> 01:53:31,639
- He was here?
- Left about an hour ago.

1181
01:53:31,764 --> 01:53:36,041
- Did he say where he was going?
- No. No message, no nothing.

1182
01:53:36,164 --> 01:53:38,553
I saw him walkin' down
the street toward the river.

1183
01:53:38,684 --> 01:53:40,640
But we have a date here.

1184
01:53:40,763 --> 01:53:44,438
Maybe he forgot.
Maybe he changed his mind.

1185
01:53:44,964 --> 01:53:47,683
<i>He'll come for me. He's a gentleman.</i>

1186
01:53:47,803 --> 01:53:51,035
Gentleman? Don't make me laugh.

1187
01:53:51,165 --> 01:53:55,316
- You know nothing about men.
- I know nothing about men?

1188
01:53:55,444 --> 01:53:58,641
And you know why?
Because you've been with too many.

1189
01:53:58,764 --> 01:54:01,597
- Thanks a lot.
- You think you're such an expert on love.

1190
01:54:01,723 --> 01:54:03,874
You can't even tell
when somebody loves you!

1191
01:54:04,004 --> 01:54:05,596
- Like who?
- Like me.

1192
01:54:05,723 --> 01:54:10,160
Like hell. You only love
that 500 francs twice a week.

1193
01:54:10,283 --> 01:54:12,877
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

1194
01:54:26,523 --> 01:54:30,152
Nestor Patou, I arrest you
for the murder of Lord X.

1195
01:54:30,283 --> 01:54:33,992
- What? The murder of who?
- You recognise these clothes?

1196
01:54:36,643 --> 01:54:41,671
That's his umbrella and his eye patch
and his solitaire card.

1197
01:54:41,803 --> 01:54:43,316
- Thank you.
- Where's the lord?

1198
01:54:43,443 --> 01:54:45,559
- At the bottom of the Seine.
- Oh, no!

1199
01:54:45,683 --> 01:54:47,992
That's a lot of nonsense.
There is no Lord X.

1200
01:54:48,123 --> 01:54:50,637
Of course there isn't,
because you killed him.

1201
01:54:50,763 --> 01:54:53,914
I saw the whole thing.
He beat him up, stole his wallet...

1202
01:54:54,043 --> 01:54:56,955
...threw his body in the river.

1203
01:54:57,082 --> 01:54:58,071
Oh!

1204
01:54:58,202 --> 01:55:01,717
Irma, I... Wait a minute.
Moustache, tell 'em.

1205
01:55:01,843 --> 01:55:04,437
Yes, that's the lord's!

1206
01:55:04,562 --> 01:55:08,680
- Oh, he was such a sweet man!
- The old, familiar pattern.

1207
01:55:08,802 --> 01:55:12,590
<i>Policeman turns dishonest, becomes
a mac and finally winds up as a murderer.</i>

1208
01:55:12,722 --> 01:55:15,874
- It's an open and shut case.
- Well, you'll just have to reopen it.

1209
01:55:16,002 --> 01:55:17,755
- Moustache can prove...
- Shh.

1210
01:55:17,882 --> 01:55:19,919
My client has nothing more to say.

1211
01:55:20,042 --> 01:55:23,240
- Your client?
- I have a law degree from Grenoble.

1212
01:55:23,403 --> 01:55:26,917
Used to be one of the leading criminal
attorneys before I was disbarred.

1213
01:55:27,042 --> 01:55:29,761
- But that's another story.
- Put the handcuffs on him.

1214
01:55:29,882 --> 01:55:34,115
Just a moment. The accused has
a right to confer with his lawyer.

1215
01:55:36,962 --> 01:55:39,681
What are you trying to do?
Why not just tell 'em the truth?

1216
01:55:39,803 --> 01:55:42,442
- The truth? That's dynamite.
- But I'm innocent.

1217
01:55:42,562 --> 01:55:45,953
The jails are full of innocent people
because they told the truth.

1218
01:55:46,082 --> 01:55:49,119
<i>You couldn't have killed Lord X
because you were Lord X...</i>

1219
01:55:49,242 --> 01:55:51,312
<i>... only you weren't Lord X,
you were a mac.</i>

1220
01:55:51,442 --> 01:55:54,116
<i>Only you weren't a mac,
you worked in the market...</i>

1221
01:55:54,241 --> 01:55:57,120
...to pay for making love
to your own girl...

1222
01:55:57,242 --> 01:56:00,438
...whom you could have made love to
for free, except you were too tired...

1223
01:56:00,562 --> 01:56:03,917
...from making the money to give to Lord X
to give to Irma to give to you.

1224
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:10,116
That's the truth. If you tell that mishmash
to a jury, you're a cinch to get 15 years.

1225
01:56:11,562 --> 01:56:16,760
- Wha... what am I gonna do?
- Nothing. Just put yourself in my hands.

1226
01:56:18,602 --> 01:56:21,320
Gentlemen, my client admits his crime.

1227
01:56:21,601 --> 01:56:24,637
- He does?
- I do?

1228
01:56:24,761 --> 01:56:26,798
But let us consider the motive.

1229
01:56:26,922 --> 01:56:29,310
<i>Why would a mac kill
his girl's best customer?</i>

1230
01:56:29,441 --> 01:56:32,673
For 500 francs, when he can get
that twice a week every week?

1231
01:56:32,801 --> 01:56:35,838
It would be like killing the goose
that laid the golden egg.

1232
01:56:35,961 --> 01:56:38,271
Or because they were
running away together?

1233
01:56:38,401 --> 01:56:42,598
Because he was losing his meal ticket?
That's equally ridiculous.

1234
01:56:42,721 --> 01:56:46,839
He's the king around here. He could
have had any girl working for him.

1235
01:56:46,961 --> 01:56:49,600
That's right.

1236
01:56:49,721 --> 01:56:54,316
So we are left with only one
possible motive - jealousy.

1237
01:56:54,441 --> 01:56:59,595
He was so in love with Irma, he couldn't
bear to have any other man touch her.

1238
01:56:59,721 --> 01:57:05,716
Yes, Inspector, it's the old,
familiar pattern - crime of passion.

1239
01:57:07,521 --> 01:57:10,274
Nestor, is that true?

1240
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:13,395
Yes.

1241
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,477
You did it because you loved me?

1242
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:17,556
Now you know.

1243
01:57:19,401 --> 01:57:21,914
And I'd kill any other man
who came near you.

1244
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,750
Gets you right here, doesn't it?

1245
01:57:24,881 --> 01:57:27,314
Take him away!

1246
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:32,559
Nestor, I love you, and I'll wait
for you, no matter how long it takes.

1247
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:48,557
You won't have to wait very long.
This is France, a civilised country.

1248
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:51,069
<i>L'amour, toujours I'amour.</i>

1249
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:53,395
When the jury hears my summation -

1250
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,317
two people in the gutter,
reaching for the stars -

1251
01:57:56,439 --> 01:57:58,237
they'll cry, they'll cheer...

1252
01:57:58,359 --> 01:58:01,988
...they'll carry him out of
the courtroom on their shoulders.

1253
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,795
Hey, Patou!

1254
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,555
Patou!

1255
01:58:29,719 --> 01:58:32,074
There's a visitor here to see you.

1256
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:53,633
- Oh, it's you.
- Shh.

1257
01:58:56,118 --> 01:58:58,234
You're lucky I can't get my hands on you.

1258
01:58:58,359 --> 01:59:01,908
- That's no way to talk to your lawyer.
- You were gonna get me off scot-free.

1259
01:59:02,038 --> 01:59:04,313
They were gonna carry me
out on their shoulders.

1260
01:59:04,439 --> 01:59:09,034
- Well, you can't win 'em all.
- 15 years at hard labour, for what?

1261
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:13,317
It's too bad you didn't get sentenced to
death. I'd have had it commuted to life...

1262
01:59:13,438 --> 01:59:16,272
...and I could have gotten you
paroled by Christmas.

1263
01:59:16,398 --> 01:59:19,869
But a 15-year sentence,
that's neither here nor there.

1264
01:59:20,918 --> 01:59:23,149
Never mind that,
tell me about Irma. How is she?

1265
01:59:23,278 --> 01:59:27,669
She's fine. Here,
I brought you a little souvenir.

1266
01:59:27,798 --> 01:59:31,154
Thanks. Why doesn't she
come to see me any more?

1267
01:59:31,278 --> 01:59:35,317
- Why haven't I heard from her?
- Well, she doesn't want you to find out.

1268
01:59:35,438 --> 01:59:37,793
Find out what? She's not
back on the street again?

1269
01:59:37,917 --> 01:59:41,672
Oh, no. That's over with. She's still
working at the fish market as a cashier.

1270
01:59:41,798 --> 01:59:44,073
Well, then, what is it? I wanna know.

1271
01:59:44,198 --> 01:59:46,029
- She's expecting.
- Who?

1272
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:49,514
Who do you think? She's out to here.
She's going to have a baby.

1273
01:59:49,637 --> 01:59:51,435
A baby? Are you sure?

1274
01:59:51,558 --> 01:59:54,355
I'd be greatly disappointed
if it were anything else.

1275
01:59:54,477 --> 01:59:56,991
- When?
- Any day now.

1276
01:59:57,117 --> 02:00:01,111
Listen, Moustache, I gotta get outta here.
I wanna be with her. She needs me.

1277
02:00:01,238 --> 02:00:04,547
- Here, I brought you another souvenir.
- More stockings?

1278
02:00:04,678 --> 02:00:06,633
And another.

1279
02:00:07,517 --> 02:00:10,590
- And another.
- Have you gone mad?

1280
02:00:10,717 --> 02:00:14,996
- And one more.
- What am I gonna do with all of these?

1281
02:00:16,197 --> 02:00:22,636
If you don't want them, throw them out
the window. But first... tie them together.

1282
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:24,712
What?

1283
02:00:56,796 --> 02:00:58,707
You can't park here.

1284
02:00:58,836 --> 02:01:01,634
There's something wrong with my motor.

1285
02:03:03,554 --> 02:03:05,510
- Nestor!
- Shh.

1286
02:03:07,235 --> 02:03:09,465
What are you doing here?
How did you get away?

1287
02:03:09,595 --> 02:03:11,505
- Give me your hand.
- Did they let you out?

1288
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,704
- Try this on.
- You escaped, didn't you?

1289
02:03:13,834 --> 02:03:16,473
- Hold still.
- Darling, why did you do that?

1290
02:03:16,595 --> 02:03:20,633
- Now they'll give you another five years.
- I was afraid of that, it's too big.

1291
02:03:20,754 --> 02:03:22,904
- What's this?
- We're gonna be married.

1292
02:03:23,033 --> 02:03:27,027
- Married?
- You want our child to be legitimate?

1293
02:03:27,154 --> 02:03:30,430
- Why, yes, of course.
- How is the baby?

1294
02:03:30,554 --> 02:03:34,308
Full of mischief. Yesterday
it kicked Coquette right off my lap.

1295
02:03:34,434 --> 02:03:38,791
Takes after me. When I was six months
old, I could change my own diapers.

1296
02:03:41,673 --> 02:03:43,311
- Nestor...
- What is it?

1297
02:03:43,434 --> 02:03:46,870
- I can't marry you.
- What do you mean, you can't marry me?

1298
02:03:46,994 --> 02:03:51,351
- Because I love you.
- You love me, so you can't marry me?

1299
02:03:51,473 --> 02:03:56,229
That's right. Because it isn't our baby.
You're not the father.

1300
02:03:57,273 --> 02:03:59,229
I'm not...?

1301
02:03:59,353 --> 02:04:01,423
Who's the father? I'll kill him!

1302
02:04:01,553 --> 02:04:04,671
You already did. It was Lord X.

1303
02:04:04,794 --> 02:04:06,749
Lord X?

1304
02:04:07,993 --> 02:04:13,465
- Well, what... what makes you think...?
- A woman always knows these things.

1305
02:04:13,594 --> 02:04:15,788
I don't care. I'll marry you anyway.

1306
02:04:15,913 --> 02:04:19,462
And I'll raise it
just as if it were my own child.

1307
02:04:40,352 --> 02:04:42,708
They've got the place surrounded.

1308
02:04:43,912 --> 02:04:48,111
Maybe you could go through
the kitchen window and over the roof.

1309
02:04:48,233 --> 02:04:50,587
No, I prefer the closet.

1310
02:04:51,513 --> 02:04:54,869
The closet?
That's the first place they'll look.

1311
02:04:59,753 --> 02:05:01,708
Open up! Police!

1312
02:05:05,312 --> 02:05:07,667
Come on! We know he's in there.

1313
02:05:14,512 --> 02:05:16,468
Yah!

1314
02:05:18,513 --> 02:05:20,787
All right, where's Nestor?

1315
02:05:20,912 --> 02:05:24,461
Don't you know? He's in jail. You can
visit him there every other Sunday.

1316
02:05:24,592 --> 02:05:27,105
Cute, huh? Let's search the place.

1317
02:05:54,752 --> 02:05:57,424
- He's not in there.
- Not in there.

1318
02:06:43,070 --> 02:06:45,425
- Not under here.
- Not under here.

1319
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:52,623
Come here, everybody.
This is the man we're looking for.

1320
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:25,222
- No sign of him.
- No sign of him.

1321
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:32,219
Tell him he'd better give himself up, or
he'll spend the rest of his life behind bars!

1322
02:07:32,349 --> 02:07:34,306
Let's go, men.

1323
02:07:38,189 --> 02:07:40,306
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

1324
02:07:41,150 --> 02:07:43,105
Let's go, men.

1325
02:07:51,389 --> 02:07:55,860
Did you hear what he said?
What are you going to do?

1326
02:07:55,989 --> 02:07:58,902
Well, the first thing I have
to do is exchange the ring.

1327
02:07:59,029 --> 02:08:02,545
But we can't get married now.
You must run, you must hide.

1328
02:08:02,669 --> 02:08:06,981
Nonsense. We'll have a church wedding
with ushers and bridesmaids and flowers.

1329
02:08:07,110 --> 02:08:11,227
- Moustache is making the arrangements.
- But they'll catch you, lock you away.

1330
02:08:11,349 --> 02:08:16,298
- I'm so afraid I'll never see you again.
- Don't be. Maybe a miracle will happen.

1331
02:08:16,429 --> 02:08:19,147
- I don't believe in miracles.
- Don't you?

1332
02:08:20,070 --> 02:08:24,620
When I met you, you were a streetwalker.
Now you're gonna be a wife and a mother.

1333
02:08:24,749 --> 02:08:27,217
Isn't that a miracle?

1334
02:08:33,629 --> 02:08:36,507
They're wasting their time
looking for him at Irma's.

1335
02:08:36,629 --> 02:08:39,859
- Don't worry, they'll catch him.
- No, they won't. Too much brains.

1336
02:08:39,989 --> 02:08:41,944
He's smarter than the whole police force?

1337
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:45,857
No, but I am. They're up
against the mastermind.

1338
02:08:45,989 --> 02:08:49,697
Oh. I'll bet by now you have him
on a boat to South America.

1339
02:08:49,828 --> 02:08:52,183
- Guess again.
- To Hong Kong?

1340
02:08:53,308 --> 02:08:55,663
He's right here in town.

1341
02:08:55,788 --> 02:08:58,905
- You don't say?
- It's ordinary common sense.

1342
02:08:59,028 --> 02:09:02,657
You've heard about a criminal always
returning to the scene of the crime?

1343
02:09:02,788 --> 02:09:05,462
The police would never think
of looking there.

1344
02:09:05,588 --> 02:09:09,786
- You mean he's under the same bridge...?
- Yeah, the Pont Royal.

1345
02:09:11,628 --> 02:09:14,301
Look, if you open up your mouth
about this to anyone...

1346
02:09:14,427 --> 02:09:19,786
Me? Squeal on a colleague? There's such
a thing as the code of the underworld.

1347
02:09:39,068 --> 02:09:42,582
Desk sergeant? Connect me
with Inspector Lefèvre.

1348
02:09:43,547 --> 02:09:47,017
Just tell him I want to
squeal on a colleague.

1349
02:10:19,027 --> 02:10:20,982
Hey.

1350
02:11:00,226 --> 02:11:03,138
- You!
- I beg your pardon?

1351
02:11:03,265 --> 02:11:06,304
- You're supposed to be dead, murdered.
- Are you quite sure?

1352
02:11:06,426 --> 02:11:10,055
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- Sorry to disappoint you, old boy...

1353
02:11:10,186 --> 02:11:14,145
...but other than a headache, I'm feeling
absolutely chapper, I mean, chipper.

1354
02:11:14,266 --> 02:11:17,941
We've been dragging the river for the
last nine months. Where have you been?

1355
02:11:18,066 --> 02:11:22,582
A fair question. Now, let me see.
I haven't the foggiest.

1356
02:11:22,706 --> 02:11:28,383
All I can remember is that the climate was
rather wet, but the fishing was quite good.

1357
02:11:28,506 --> 02:11:34,137
Now, I trust that that clears things up
satisfactorily, so cheerio and carry on.

1358
02:12:09,985 --> 02:12:11,179
Are you all right?

1359
02:12:11,304 --> 02:12:13,580
The pains are coming
every two minutes now.

1360
02:12:13,705 --> 02:12:16,378
Just try to hold on a little longer.

1361
02:12:25,144 --> 02:12:27,374
Where's the groom?

1362
02:12:35,265 --> 02:12:39,496
Don't worry. If worst comes to worst,
I'll marry you myself.

1363
02:13:00,064 --> 02:13:02,942
<i>- You look lovely.
- Later, later.</i>

1364
02:13:04,063 --> 02:13:07,693
Nestor, wilt thou take Irma
here present for thy lawful wife...

1365
02:13:07,824 --> 02:13:10,543
...according to the rite
of our holy mother, the Church?

1366
02:13:10,664 --> 02:13:11,858
I will.

1367
02:13:11,984 --> 02:13:15,498
Irma, wilt thou take Nestor
here present for thy lawful husband...

1368
02:13:15,623 --> 02:13:17,694
...according to the rite of our holy mother?

1369
02:13:17,823 --> 02:13:19,176
I will.

1370
02:13:19,304 --> 02:13:25,379
<i>Ego conjungo vos in matrimonium, in
nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sanctis.</i>

1371
02:13:25,504 --> 02:13:27,459
<i>Amen.</i>

1372
02:13:31,984 --> 02:13:36,613
<i>Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domini,
qui fecit coelum et terram.</i>

1373
02:13:36,984 --> 02:13:39,178
<i>Domine, exaudi orationem meam...</i>

1374
02:13:39,343 --> 02:13:41,413
<i>... et clamor meus ad te veniat.</i>

1375
02:13:41,543 --> 02:13:45,332
<i>Dominus vobiscum
et cum spirito tuo. Oremus.</i>

1376
02:14:09,423 --> 02:14:12,495
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

1377
02:14:12,623 --> 02:14:16,456
- And I pledge thee my fidelity.
- And I pledge thee my fidelity.

1378
02:14:25,942 --> 02:14:27,899
Just a minute, Patou.

1379
02:14:29,262 --> 02:14:31,412
I wanna congratulate you.
It was touching.

1380
02:14:31,542 --> 02:14:34,852
- Awful nice of you to show up.
- We're planning a reception for you.

1381
02:14:34,983 --> 02:14:37,816
- At the police station.
- My wife is about to have...

1382
02:14:37,942 --> 02:14:40,662
A hoax has been perpetrated.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

1383
02:14:40,783 --> 02:14:43,899
- You can't arrest me in a church.
- Arrest you?

1384
02:14:44,022 --> 02:14:46,900
I want you to rejoin the force
and help us solve this case.

1385
02:14:47,022 --> 02:14:49,217
Rejoin the force? Gee, I'd like that.

1386
02:14:49,342 --> 02:14:52,015
Not unless I can have my old job back,
at the playground.

1387
02:14:52,142 --> 02:14:54,736
Playground? Work for
peanuts and jellybeans?

1388
02:14:54,863 --> 02:14:57,820
I'm crazy about children.
I'm about to have one myself.

1389
02:15:00,422 --> 02:15:03,016
I just had it. Excuse me.

1390
02:15:13,821 --> 02:15:17,179
It's a girl. Smoothest delivery I ever had.

1391
02:15:17,301 --> 02:15:20,134
<i>She's beautiful. You delivered the baby?</i>

1392
02:15:20,262 --> 02:15:25,211
Why not? I was chief obstetrician in
Equatorial Africa, under Dr Schweitzer.

1393
02:15:30,661 --> 02:15:32,617
Nestor.

1394
02:15:36,021 --> 02:15:39,775
- They're not taking you away?
- You can call me Officer Patou again.

1395
02:15:39,901 --> 02:15:41,892
- What happened?
- Not now.

1396
02:15:42,021 --> 02:15:45,775
<i>- Oh, let me hold her.</i>

1397
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:51,290
Oh, it's gonna be such fun
bringing her up.

1398
02:15:51,981 --> 02:15:55,451
I can put her in organdie
dresses and pinafores.

1399
02:15:55,581 --> 02:15:58,176
And I'm gonna get her some
green stockings and a puppy.

1400
02:15:58,300 --> 02:15:59,211
Yeah.

1401
02:15:59,342 --> 02:16:03,129
Oh, no. No green stockings. No puppy.

1402
02:16:03,261 --> 02:16:05,216
- No?
- No.

1403
02:16:33,021 --> 02:16:34,976
Cheeribye.

1404
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:47,455
But that's another story.
