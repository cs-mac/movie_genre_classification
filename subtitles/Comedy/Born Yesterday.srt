1
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:08,207
Captain!

2
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,165
-Eddie, my briefcase?
-Here.

3
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,007
Hang on to it.

4
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:34,001
All right, already. Come on, come on.

5
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:44,004
This way, Mr. Brock.

6
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:02,639
Mr. Brock, welcome to
the Washington Statler. Your wing--

7
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,444
-I ain't got a whole floor?
-You've got an entire wing.

8
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,204
I don't want one wing.
I want the whole bird.

9
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:15,199
-Your private elevator.
-Private? That's more like it.

10
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,361
-Hello.
-How are you?

11
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:18,558
Mr. Brock--

12
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:22,205
I thought you said this
was private. Take off.

13
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,521
You should be satisfied.

14
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,318
The public corridor and elevators--

15
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:33,442
-West, East and South Suite.
-Which one's mine?

16
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:36,800
The South Suite.
Each a private apartment.

17
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,805
Sleeping quarters upstairs,
terrace overlooks Washington.

18
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:45,728
-I'd like to point out--
-It's all right.

19
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:49,041
I'd like to point out
that this suite--

20
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:58,717
This suite is usually reserved
for foreign diplomats.

21
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,604
Oh, I almost forgot.
We thought you'd like this.

22
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:06,199
-Compliments of the management.
-Okay. Don't bother me.

23
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,401
May I?

24
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,598
May I show you the rest
of the accommodations?

25
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,408
Hey, Billie!

26
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,758
-What?
-Not bad, huh?

27
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:38,281
-It's all right.
-You know what this place costs a day?

28
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,208
Four hundred, you told me.

29
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,838
-Mrs. Brock seems delighted.
-It's not ''Mrs. Brock.''

30
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:56,927
Ain't no Mrs. Brock except my mother.
She's dead.

31
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,158
I see.

32
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:01,805
-Now look, don't get nosy.
-Oh, not at all.

33
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:07,801
She's a fiancée. Mine, in fact.
Eddie, take care of him.

34
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,042
Pardon me, sir.

35
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,081
-Thank you, Mr. Brock.
-Okay. Don't bother me.

36
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:17,202
How's the monarch of all he surveys?

37
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,287
-You plastered again?
-Still. Welcome.

38
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,406
I got things that can't wait.

39
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:25,646
-I got this ticket to get fixed.
-What about?

40
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,647
Some louse, just as we blew into town.

41
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:32,677
-I'm a lawyer, I don't own the law.
-What'd I do?

42
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,045
I'll see what I can manage.

43
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,878
-How'd we do?
-May cost a shade more.

44
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,687
-How much?
-It's negligible.

45
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,039
-Why more?
-Supply and demand, Harry.

46
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,247
Crooks are rare in these parts.
Don't worry.

47
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,088
Don't worry?
This stuff ain't deductible.

48
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,282
I'm not so sure.
''Item: One bribe, $80,000.''

49
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:55,162
Eighty! You're very handy
with my dough!

50
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,638
Fellow's coming up here any minute
to interview you. Paul Verrall.

51
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,044
Freelance snoop. Political stuff.

52
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:06,480
I don't wanna talk to no writer.
Eddie!

53
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,998
-You better talk to this one.
-Why?

54
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:14,408
He's one to look out for.
Take him in, then he won't go poking.

55
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,407
What's so important?

56
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,039
What we're after is important.

57
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,043
Listen, to get by in this town
takes power. You got some.

58
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:26,080
Takes money. You got plenty.

59
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:29,838
But above all, it takes
judgment and intelligence.

60
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:33,246
That's why you pay me
1 00,000 a year.

61
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,639
-What's all the excitement?
-Just making it clear where I fit in.

62
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,647
-Eddie, get me a shave up here.
-Right.

63
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,043
-Harry.
-What?

64
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,278
Barber shop!

65
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:47,959
Tell Billie to wear something plain
for the congressman.

66
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,848
Tell her yourself. You ain't pregnant.

67
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,649
Send up a barber
and a manicure right now.

68
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,159
Harry Brock! That's right.
Okay, make it snappy.

69
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:59,883
-And a shine!
-And a shine! Be right up.

70
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,157
Look, don't you worry about Billie.
One thing, she knows how to dress.

71
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:06,928
Probably Verrall.

72
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:10,561
-Hello, Paul.
-Hello, Jim.

73
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,288
Harry Brock, Paul Verrall.

74
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,201
-How do you do?
-How are you?

75
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,765
-Ain't I seen you before?
-I'll leave you.

76
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,561
What'll you drink?

77
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,329
-Scotch, if you got it.
-If I got it? Eddie.

78
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,281
Where do you think you are?

79
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,089
Where you been?
Get him a Scotch and--

80
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,478
-Soda?
-Water.

81
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,688
-Rye ginger ale for you?
-Right. He knows.

82
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,928
Worked for me many years.
He's my cousin. He knows me.

83
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,597
-Right.
-Maybe I'll interview Eddie.

84
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:43,688
Pretty good. Maybe you
got something there. Sit down.

85
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,404
What's it gonna be, pal?
A plug or a pan?

86
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:50,077
I know how to talk
if I know your angle.

87
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,763
-No angle, just facts.
-A pan?

88
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:55,483
-Not exactly.
-Write whatever you want.

89
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,367
Come up. I wanna get shaved.

90
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:02,200
Nobody can hurt me.
I'm only talking because Jim asked me.

91
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:06,243
Pay him 1 00 grand for advice,
I'm a sucker not to take it.

92
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,606
-That's right.
-Butt out, will you?

93
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,088
Devery likes it
when I get wrote about.

94
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,958
-What do you wanna know?
-How much money you got?

95
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,158
What?

96
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:21,202
-How much money?
-What am l, an accountant?

97
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,280
-You don't know?
-Not exactly.

98
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,599
-Fifty million?
-I don't know.

99
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,202
-Ten million?
-Maybe.

100
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:28,848
-One million?
-More.

101
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,761
-How much more?
-Plenty.

102
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,805
-I made every nickel of it.
-Nice work.

103
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,638
You're gonna give me the business.
That's all right.

104
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,807
-You got me all--
-Tell how I'm a roughneck.

105
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:45,404
Everybody's scared.
For me, that's good.

106
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,048
Well, not everybody.

107
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:51,248
Enough. You can't hurt me.
All you can do is build me up.

108
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:54,845
-Hey, Eddie. Have a drink.
-No, thanks, really.

109
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,406
Do what I tell you.
Who pays you around here?

110
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,802
At home, he shaves me.
I got my own barber chair, right?

111
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,408
That's right.

112
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,844
-Go ahead, pal. Interview me.
-Where were you born?

113
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:15,077
Plainfield, New Jersey. 1 907. I went
to work when I was 1 2 years old.

114
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:19,805
I been working ever since.
My first job was a paper route.

115
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,438
I bought a kid out with a swift kick.

116
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,879
And you've been
working ever since.

117
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:29,799
Tell you how I'm top man in my racket.
Been in it 25 years.

118
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,240
-Steel.
-Not steel, junk.

119
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:37,528
-And I ain't ashamed to admit it.
-All right.

120
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,562
Here's some advice:
Never bull a bull artist.

121
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,841
I can sling it with the best of them.

122
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:48,287
-For 25 years, you say?
-Yeah. I'm a kid with a paper route.

123
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:52,084
I got a wagon. Going home,
I pick up junk in alleys.

124
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:55,406
I'm not the only one.
Other kids do it too.

125
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,885
Difference is, they keep it.
Not me. I sell it.

126
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:03,088
I'm making eight dollars in junk
and three from papers.

127
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:07,288
I see which is the right racket.
I'm a kid, but I see that.

128
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,760
Soon the guy I sell to
is handing me 20 a week.

129
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,043
Then he turns around,
offers me a job for 1 0. Dumb jerk.

130
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,247
I'd sell him his own stuff
and he never knew.

131
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,480
-How do you mean?
-Look....

132
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:24,125
In the night,
I drag it out, I load it up.

133
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:27,401
In the morning I go in
the front and collect.

134
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,447
-Twelve years old?
-Something like that.

135
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:33,323
-Pretty soon you own the yard.
-Right.

136
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,885
The jerk works for me now.
Know who else does?

137
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:42,209
The kid whose paper route I swiped.
I figure I owe him.

138
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,207
Good last few years
for the junk business.

139
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:50,800
-I ain't kicking.
-Do you anticipate any decline now?

140
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:54,121
-Talk plain.
-Is it still going to be good?

141
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,842
-We'll make it good.
-Who?

142
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,562
-Me, that's who.
-I see.

143
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,124
-Fancy talk don't go with me.
-Come in.

144
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:02,998
-Good evening.
-Hello.

145
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:06,283
-I'll get out--
-No, don't go. I like you.

146
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:10,078
Play your cards right,
I'll put you on the payroll.

147
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:15,198
Once over light, no talk.
I get a manicure every day.

148
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,598
Over there someplace.

149
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,399
Okay, fellow, go ahead.

150
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:25,646
I wonder what you're doing
in Washington.

151
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:28,886
What are you, a wonder boy?
Not so tight.

152
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,882
Sightseeing, that's what I'm doing.

153
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,683
Some talk you've come
to find out--

154
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,687
So far I've been nice to you.
Don't pump me.

155
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:42,241
How's it going? How are you getting
on with King Junk?

156
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:46,203
He was born in New Jersey.
Sure is a tough man to dig.

157
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:49,526
I can't believe that.
He loves to talk. Billie!

158
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:51,924
This is Paul Verrall.
Billie Dawn.

159
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,158
How do you do?

160
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,325
-Wait.
-What's the matter?

161
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:00,562
Where you going? Put it back!

162
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,999
-I just wanted--
-Put it back!

163
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:04,688
-Why--?
-Because I say.

164
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,682
Somebody's coming.
I don't want you stinking.

165
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:12,605
-Can't I just--?
-Go change. Don't give me no trouble!

166
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,206
Do what I'm telling you!

167
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,404
Barber, what'll you take
to cut his throat?

168
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,008
Some jokes I don't like.

169
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,599
-Don't get excited.
-Don't tell me what to do!

170
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:41,688
-Just a joke, Harry.
-That's all. I said beat it.

171
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,282
Eddie, take care of them.

172
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,679
-I'll be going too.
-No, don't.

173
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,880
You're the only friend
I got left.

174
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,122
I live around the corner.
If anybody beats you, scream.

175
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:53,682
I'll come running.

176
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:56,443
-Goodbye, Jim. Thanks.
-Goodbye.

177
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,484
I need Billie's signature.

178
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:03,806
Sure. Billie!

179
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,638
-You sore?
-Not sore, Harry.

180
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:12,247
-You look funny.
-I know.

181
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,162
-You want an aspirin?
-No, no, I'm fine.

182
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,641
Considering I've been dead
for 1 6 years...

183
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,602
...I'm in remarkable health.

184
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,848
-Billie!
-What?

185
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:34,801
Billie!

186
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,047
-What?
-Come over here right away!

187
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:43,242
Honey, would you please
fix the safety catch?

188
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,486
-He sure got good lungs.
-Yeah. Thanks.

189
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:50,244
There's a shortcut through
the service. This way.

190
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:58,046
-That's the door, honey.
-Thanks, honey.

191
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,404
Sometime I don't understand you.

192
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:11,203
-Sometime?
-What do you want?

193
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:12,398
Jim.

194
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,282
Few things I want you to sign, honey.

195
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:19,801
-That's all I do around here.
-Too bad about you.

196
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,682
-When's this congressman coming?
-Anytime.

197
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,885
I better get fixed up, huh?

198
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:27,643
-She look all right?
-Look who's talking.

199
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,808
You tell me. I don't wanna start off
on no left foot.

200
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:36,281
What got into him?

201
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:39,287
Nothing. Wants to make
a good impression.

202
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:41,042
So let him.

203
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,886
Two places on this one, please.

204
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,081
What happened to all that stuff
I signed last week?

205
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,842
All used up.

206
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,402
I must've signed
about a million of these.

207
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,839
What you get as corporate officer.

208
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:00,041
I am? What do you know?

209
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:03,204
Come a long way from the chorus.

210
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,481
I wasn't only in the chorus.
I spoke lines.

211
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:09,038
-Really?
-Of course.

212
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,688
-How many?
-How many what?

213
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:15,323
-Lines did you speak?
-Five.

214
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,478
-I never knew that.
-Ask anybody.

215
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,247
I believe you.

216
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:24,884
I could've been a star
if I'd have stuck to it.

217
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:29,082
-Why didn't you?
-Harry didn't want me in the show.

218
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:33,038
He didn't wanna share me
with the general public.

219
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,602
I see.

220
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:40,241
Harry's changed. Don't you think so?

221
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,999
-How?
-He used to be more satisfied.

222
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,484
Now he's always
running around like this.

223
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:49,289
What'd he have to come
to Washington for?

224
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,283
-Long story.
-Well, don't tell it to me.

225
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:58,080
-I just wish he'd settle down.
-He's ambitious.

226
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:01,406
He talks all the time now.
He never used to.

227
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:06,478
Now he always tells me how
he's gonna be bigger, run everything.

228
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:12,008
-He may, at that.
-I don't care one way or the other.

229
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:16,522
-Take it easy.
-Now don't you start!

230
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,118
Better to drink after they're gone.

231
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,604
-This congressman?
-And Mrs. Hedges.

232
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,642
-This fella works for him.
-In a way.

233
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:27,238
So what's he putting it on for?

234
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,285
Just be nice. No rough language.

235
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,680
-I won't open my mush.
-I didn't mean that.

236
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:38,207
I don't have to be down here.
I could go back to my place.

237
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,798
In fact, I think I will.

238
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:45,400
-I tell you, Harry wouldn't like it.
-All right, all right!

239
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:56,399
How are you, Norval?
Haven't seen you in ages, Anna.

240
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:58,082
-You haven't.
-Come in.

241
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:02,880
You remember this little lady.
She used to be Billie Dawn.

242
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,085
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

243
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:07,889
This is Mr. Hedges
I've told you about.

244
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:09,681
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

245
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:13,285
-And this is Mrs. Hedges.
-Glad to meet you.

246
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,400
Glad to meet you.

247
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,001
-How about the terrace?
-That'd be nice.

248
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,278
-A drink?
-Love one.

249
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,281
-Sounds all right.
-Scotch?

250
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,838
-Scotch all around, Eddie.
-Right.

251
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:36,684
He's awfully tired.

252
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,605
-Stand over a hot resolution all day?
-Just about.

253
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,441
How do you like Washington,
Mrs. Brock?

254
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:07,239
-I haven't seen it yet.
-This is the first time you've been?

255
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,044
That's what I mean.
I never went on the road.

256
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:15,083
Well, we must show you around.
Beautiful city.

257
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,878
Too bad the Supreme Court
isn't in session.

258
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:20,642
What is it?

259
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,043
Lots of people'd
like to know that.

260
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:30,604
-Hello.
-Mr. Hedges, Harry Brock.

261
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,765
It's about time we got together.

262
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,642
Mrs. Hedges, I'm happy to meet you.

263
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:38,647
-Thank you.
-Sit down. Congressman.

264
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,889
-Have a good trip?
-I come in my car.

265
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:52,281
Stopped in Baltimore.
I got a junkyard there, second one.

266
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,646
-Before, I only had one.
-How many do you have?

267
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:57,919
I couldn't answer that, baby.

268
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:01,685
-Excuse me.
-That's all right.

269
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:06,047
I don't know why I like Baltimore.
I get a feeling from it.

270
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,888
-Sentimental.
-Yes, I'm sentimental.

271
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,604
I think we're all a bit sentimental.

272
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:16,599
Well, it's a free country.

273
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:26,041
-Do you play bridge, Mrs. Brock?
-No, only gin.

274
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:28,406
-I beg your pardon?
-Gin rummy.

275
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,440
Oh, yes, of course.

276
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:34,887
I was going to ask you to join us.
A few of the girls meet.

277
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,523
I don't play bridge.

278
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:40,647
-You could learn!
-I don't think so.

279
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:45,201
She couldn't play till I learned her.
Now she beats my brains out.

280
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:49,841
How're you fixed for time tomorrow?

281
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:52,438
-Ten o'clock?
-Pretty early for me.

282
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:54,605
I'll say.

283
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,320
-Eleven?
-Okay.

284
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:02,199
-I can drop by here.
-Sure, it's on your way.

285
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,402
We can discuss the operation
and get a head start.

286
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,199
Wanna wash your hands
or anything, honey?

287
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,887
<i>No, thank you.</i>

288
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:21,322
I hope you're free
for Friday night dinner.

289
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,839
-People I want Harry to meet.
-Who wanna meet him.

290
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:29,088
-Thank you for everything, Mr. Brock.
-Call me Harry.

291
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:32,480
I haven't written you....
You understand.

292
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:35,283
You know I'm interested
in scrap iron.

293
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:39,283
I wanna sell it and not get stuck
with falling prices.

294
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:43,488
-I have a copy--
-Boil it down and give it to me.

295
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:48,001
I didn't come here to do paperwork.
The way I work is this:

296
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:50,962
Get the other guy
before he gets you.

297
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:57,284
I got in mind a worldwide
operating combo. Enough for everybody.

298
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:01,801
Up till now, everybody's lined up
and understands everybody.

299
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,604
-I wanna move.
-You understand that legislation--

300
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:10,883
That's a lot of hot air.
I ain't talking about peanuts....

301
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:15,047
Give them enough rope. I've said so.

302
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,323
The trouble with these do-gooders is--

303
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:26,602
They never seem to know when to stop.
I've said--

304
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:31,638
We can do this.
It's up to you to find out how.

305
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:34,278
One amendment, for example...

306
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:38,681
...guarantees government support
of scrap iron price levels.

307
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:40,647
We want to get it through.

308
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:44,967
See that you do. I'm here
to see that I get what I paid for.

309
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:48,281
-How do things look to you?
-Generally?

310
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:53,882
This country has to decide if
the people will run the government...

311
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,319
...or the other way around.

312
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,087
That's sound thinking.

313
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,047
-Thank you.
-Worthy of Holmes.

314
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:01,887
Great man, Holmes.

315
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:05,280
-My personal god.
-Who?

316
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:09,404
-Oliver Wendell Holmes.
-A wonderful man.

317
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,879
He gonna be here Friday night?

318
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:14,689
-I don't think so.
-Too bad.

319
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:17,323
-We mustn't keep you.
-We mustn't.

320
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,485
-Good night.
-Good night.

321
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:22,846
-Good night. See you tomorrow.
-That's right.

322
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,041
-Good night, Anna.
-Thank you so much.

323
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:30,037
Wait a while. I'll give you
something to thank me for.

324
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,482
Good night, all.

325
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:51,922
Drips.

326
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,279
-They're drips.
-Who are you to say?

327
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:57,481
-I'm myself.
-Nobody asked you. Shut up.

328
00:21:57,729 --> 00:22:01,324
-Pardon me for living.
-Get lost.

329
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:04,242
-Not yet.
-Get lost, I told you.

330
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:20,087
-She'll be in the way.
-What are you gonna do?

331
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:23,287
-I'd like to give her the brush.
-Complicated.

332
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:26,640
-I know.
-She owns more of you than you do.

333
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:31,400
She's gonna louse me up down the line.
Dumb broad.

334
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,083
You may be right.

335
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:36,048
-Listen, Harry. Send her home.
-No.

336
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:37,728
Why not?

337
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:43,685
-I'm nuts for her.
-Can't have your cake and eat it.

338
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:45,117
Just a saying.

339
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:48,605
-That don't make any sense.
-All right.

340
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:56,008
-What's cake got to do with it?
-Nothing, Harry.

341
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,087
-Must be a way to smarten her up.
-I guess so.

342
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:01,889
-Some kind of school?
-I doubt that.

343
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,243
Then what?

344
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:06,879
We might find someone
to smooth the rough edges.

345
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,649
-How?
-Let me think about it.

346
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,477
I want you to think about something.
About marrying her.

347
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:17,044
Why marriage all of a sudden?

348
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:20,639
A wife couldn't testify
against her husband.

349
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:24,205
You've been engaged for seven years.
Why wait?

350
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:26,127
I didn't wanna be rushed.

351
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:29,719
We get married,
she'll think she's got it coming.

352
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:31,999
-She's different.
-A broad's a broad.

353
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:34,598
-You'll be sorry.
-I'll let you know.

354
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:37,443
We still gotta do something about her.

355
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:42,040
She opens her kisser,
something wrong come out. Talk to her.

356
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:44,399
-Take more than a talk.
-Then what?

357
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:47,601
It's not easy to make a person over.

358
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:51,688
Wait. That interview guy.
He's a smart cookie.

359
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,083
Paul Verrall.

360
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,678
He knows this town. He's classy.

361
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,681
-But he won't do it.
-Why?

362
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:01,046
-I'll pay him what he wants.
-I don't think so.

363
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:03,365
I bet you. What's his number?

364
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,443
-I'm not sure--
-What's his number? Come on.

365
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:11,324
-You ate already?
-Yeah.

366
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:13,287
-Piece of pie?
-No.

367
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,043
-Sit. How about a drink?
-No, thanks.

368
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,087
Okay, pal.

369
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,241
-I wanna ask you something.
-Sure.

370
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:30,247
-How much you make?
-Am I an accountant?

371
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:33,486
-I love this guy. Your name again?
-Verrall.

372
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:35,481
-Your regular name.
-Paul.

373
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:40,683
I got a friend, a good kid--
Maybe you seen her around. Billie?

374
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,443
She's a little on the stupid side.

375
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,879
I got her out of the chorus.

376
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:50,799
She'll be unhappy here,
never been with such kind of people.

377
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:52,727
-Know what I mean?
-I don't.

378
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:56,245
-You could help her out. Me too.
-How?

379
00:24:56,449 --> 00:25:01,079
Explain things to her in your
spare time. What do you say?

380
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:05,720
-I don't think I could handle it.
-Mean an awful lot to me.

381
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:09,322
I'll give you 200 bucks a week.

382
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:14,649
-I'll do it.
-I love this guy.

383
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,487
-When do I start?
-Now.

384
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:21,717
Come with me and I'll introduce you.
You can take it from there.

385
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:28,437
Billie!

386
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:32,324
-What?!
-Come down here a minute. Come on in.

387
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,129
She's a nice kid.
You're gonna like her.

388
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:40,727
-I'm getting dressed.
-He's a friend of the family.

389
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:43,318
Come on, I'm telling you!

390
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,966
-This is Paul Verrall.
-I know.

391
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:50,767
He wants to talk to you.

392
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,925
-What about?
-You'll find out.

393
00:25:53,129 --> 00:25:57,327
Jim and I got work to do.
I'll have to leave you two.

394
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:12,726
Your friend, Mr. Brock, has an idea.

395
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,961
He'd like us to spend
a little time together.

396
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,767
You and me, that is.

397
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,965
-You don't say.
-Yes.

398
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,366
-What are you, a gigolo?
-Not exactly.

399
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:26,959
-So what's the idea?
-Well, it's nothing special.

400
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,685
He'd like me to put you wise
to a few things, show you the ropes.

401
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:34,323
-Answer any questions.
-I got none.

402
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:37,521
-I'll give you some.
-Thanks.

403
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:41,959
It might be fun for you.
There's a lot to see here.

404
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,160
I'd be glad to show you around.

405
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,559
-You know the Supreme Court?
-Yes.

406
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:49,363
-I'd like to take that in.
-Fine.

407
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,759
-We're on, then?
-How you mean?

408
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:53,123
The arrangement.

409
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:56,964
-I don't mind. Got nothing to do.
-Good.

410
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:59,962
-What's he paying you?
-Two hundred.

411
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:02,928
You could've got more.
He's got plenty.

412
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:05,279
Oh, I'd have done it for free.

413
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:06,888
-I would.
-Why?

414
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:09,922
This isn't work. I like it.

415
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:12,683
-He thinks I'm too stupid, huh?
-No.

416
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:15,357
He's right. I'm stupid and I like it.

417
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,328
-You do?
-Sure.

418
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:21,727
I got everything I want.
Two mink coats, everything.

419
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,762
If there's something I want, I ask.

420
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:27,529
And if he don't act friendly...

421
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,519
...I don't act friendly.

422
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,488
As long as I know how to get
what I want, that's all.

423
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,681
-As long as you know what you want.
-Sure.

424
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:43,484
-What?
-As long as you know what you want.

425
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,438
-Are you trying to mix me up?
-Well, no.

426
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,881
-I'll tell you what I would like.
-Yes?

427
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:58,399
-I'd like to learn how to talk good.
-All right.

428
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:01,084
-Is it hard?
-I don't think so.

429
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:03,086
What do I have to do?

430
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:06,520
I might give you
a few books to start with.

431
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:10,165
Every now and then I'll correct you.

432
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:12,969
-Go ahead.
-Well, that is, when I know.

433
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,763
-I don't talk so good myself.
-You'll do.

434
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:18,847
-Good.
-I never say ''ain't.'' Did you notice?

435
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,643
-Oh, I do.
-I'll correct you then.

436
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:25,326
-Do that.
-Since I was small I never say it.

437
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:28,083
Our teacher used to slug you
if you did.

438
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,086
-Did what?
-Said ''ain't.''

439
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:33,725
-I got out of the habit.
-Was it worth the slugging?

440
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:35,038
Oh, not hard.

441
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:38,764
There's too much slugging.
I don't believe in it.

442
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,318
-I don't believe in it either.
-Good.

443
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:44,168
-I learn fast.
-You're great, Miss Dawn.

444
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:47,321
-Billie.
-Billie. An odd name, isn't it?

445
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,884
Half the kids I know are named it.

446
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:53,877
-Anyway, it isn't my real name.
-Oh? What is?

447
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:56,603
Holy cats. Emma.

448
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,524
-What's the matter?
-Do I look to you like an Emma?

449
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,966
No. You don't look
like a Billie either.

450
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,962
What do I look like?

451
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:08,325
-To me?
-Yeah, you.

452
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:12,328
You look like a lovely girl.

453
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,320
Let me ask you....

454
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:25,325
Are you one of these talkers, or would
you be interested in a little action?

455
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:29,562
-What?
-I got a yen for you right off.

456
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,279
-Well, do you get many?
-Now and then.

457
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:36,686
-What do you do about it?
-You'll find out.

458
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:40,768
-I will.
-Want a tip? Sweet-talk me, I like it.

459
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:45,764
Like that ''lovely girl'' line.
Don't worry, he don't see a thing.

460
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:48,762
He's too dizzy from being a big man.

461
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:51,688
This is gonna be different
than I thought.

462
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:54,005
-Do you mind?
-No.

463
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,918
It's only fair.
We'll educate each other.

464
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:00,801
-About those books.
-Yes?

465
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:06,078
I'll look around. If there's anything
interesting, I'll drop it back.

466
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:10,328
You can drop it back even
if it's not so interesting.

467
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:18,921
-You two gonna get together?
-I think we're all set.

468
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:23,486
-Great, great. Appreciate it.
-So do l.

469
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,328
Well, I guess-- I guess I'll be going.

470
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,725
So long, kid!

471
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,918
So long, kid.

472
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:38,487
Gin!

473
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:45,563
Forty-one.

474
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,925
-Forty-one?
-Forty-one.

475
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:36,164
Pay attention, that Verrall guy
can do you some good.

476
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:38,127
All right.

477
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:45,959
You're in the big league.
You should watch your step.

478
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:48,120
All right.

479
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:55,918
You gotta learn to fit in.
Can't have you around if you don't.

480
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:01,562
Have to be careful
of what you do and say.

481
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,322
Three.

482
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,363
Twenty-eight.

483
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,719
-Twenty-eight?
-Twenty-eight!

484
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:29,199
You could use a little
education yourself.

485
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,127
-Who asked you?
-Nobody.

486
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:33,320
So shut up!

487
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,124
-Can't I talk?
-Go on, play your cards.

488
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:02,121
-It's a free country.
-That's what you think.

489
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,162
Do you mind?!

490
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:43,048
Gin.

491
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:50,837
Thirty-four.

492
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,728
-Thirty-four?
-Thirty-four!

493
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:00,720
-Schneider!
-What?

494
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,124
$55.60.

495
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:06,162
-All right, that's enough.
-Pay me now.

496
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:09,845
-Don't you trust me?
-Sore loser!

497
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:11,642
Shut up!

498
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:16,119
Fifty-five dollars and 60 cents.

499
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:42,723
Thanks.

500
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,158
-You gonna play like that all night?
-What?

501
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:06,648
Hurt your eyes.

502
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,523
-Hello.
-Hello.

503
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:42,727
I tried your suite. No answer.

504
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,518
Yeah, I know. I'm not in.

505
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:50,885
-Morning papers.
-Oh, I don't read papers.

506
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:54,764
-Never?
-Once in a while, the funnies.

507
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:57,881
I think you should.
The not-so-funnies.

508
00:37:58,089 --> 00:37:59,078
Why?

509
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:02,122
-Well, it's interesting.
-Not to me.

510
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:03,887
How do you know?

511
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:08,128
If you're gonna turn out
to be a pest, we can call it off.

512
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,318
Sorry.

513
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:13,881
I look at the papers sometimes,
but I never understand it.

514
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,886
So what's the sense?

515
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:19,968
Look through these, and anything
you don't understand...

516
00:38:20,169 --> 00:38:23,366
...make a circle around it.
Then I'll explain.

517
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:26,077
-Whatever I can. All right?
-All right.

518
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:29,486
And I thought you might like these.

519
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,920
Well, I'll try.

520
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:37,281
Start reading. If you don't
like it, start something else.

521
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:40,083
One thing, my eyesight isn't so hot.

522
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:42,359
Why don't you wear glasses?

523
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:45,322
-Sure, why not?
-Because it's terrible.

524
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:04,006
Of course, they're not so bad on men.

525
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:09,920
-Good night, Billie.
-Good night.

526
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:30,528
Hello!

527
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:35,527
Miss Dawn around?

528
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:40,720
-Have you seen Miss Dawn?
-In her room.

529
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:47,085
-Hello?
-Yes?

530
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:50,087
-Ready to start.
-Come on up!

531
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:23,923
-Hello.
-Hello.

532
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:30,639
-Been reading, huh? That's good.
-Yeah.

533
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:33,528
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

534
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:45,125
-Did you have your breakfast yet?
-And lunch.

535
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:51,323
-There's a few things here.
-Which?

536
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:07,527
Read it out.

537
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,525
You want me to read?

538
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:14,162
Billie, things
are complicated enough...

539
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:17,520
...without complicating them further.

540
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:23,528
I ought to take this pencil
and make a circle around you.

541
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:30,124
-Here are a few places you should see.
-A few?

542
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:34,925
The Capitol. I'll tell you all I know,
then we'll join a tour.

543
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:37,723
Senate's in session today.

544
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:41,325
Let's go to the rotunda.
It's famous for its--

545
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:45,648
-Come on. You'll find it interesting.
-I'm coming.

546
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:47,561
--now before Congress.

547
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:52,724
On the walls of this rotunda
are eight historical paintings....

548
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:57,766
--with the landing of the Pilgrims....

549
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:01,439
--Revolutionary War paintings,
depicting the start...

550
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:05,767
...and finish of that war,
and its two greatest battles.

551
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:11,839
The east wall contains paintings
predating the Revolutionary period.

552
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:15,968
<i>--The Glorification</i>
<i>Of the Spirit of George Washington.</i>

553
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:20,367
Washington is the figure
with the purple robe on his lap.

554
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:25,438
The figures around him
represent Liberty and Victory.

555
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:30,359
Brumidi did most of that work
lying on his back...

556
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:34,488
...on a scaffold built
from the floor to the dome...

557
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:38,648
...a distance of 1 80 feet
and 3 inches.

558
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:41,760
Now if you'll follow me....

559
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:45,524
How could anybody paint
upside down like that?

560
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,527
Hey, give me one of those.

561
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:02,726
-Hello.
-How are you?

562
00:43:56,209 --> 00:43:58,928
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

563
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,000
There's the Constitution...

564
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:12,727
...the Declaration of Independence.
And come here.

565
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:19,960
And the Bill of Rights.
Know how old these are?

566
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:23,565
-Oh, about 1 60 years.
-Who told you?

567
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:27,119
-What else do you know about it?
-What else?

568
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:31,328
-What else?
-This whole country...

569
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:35,317
...is founded on these
three pieces of paper.

570
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:37,918
This whole country?

571
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:46,359
''The right of the people
to keep and bear arms...

572
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:50,318
-...shall not be in-fringed.''
-Infringed.

573
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:56,202
Good thing it's covered with glass.
I'd be making circles all over it.

574
00:44:57,369 --> 00:44:59,121
How about some ice cream?

575
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:03,523
Anything but tutti-frutti.

576
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:06,961
-How's chocolate?
-Fine.

577
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:10,366
-I like you better with them on.
-What?

578
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:12,525
Your glasses!

579
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:20,279
Thanks. You know, chocolate's
the most popular.

580
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:21,922
I read that.

581
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:27,524
It's interesting how many things
a person could learn if they read.

582
00:45:28,129 --> 00:45:30,563
I don't suppose you read my piece.

583
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:34,119
What are you talking?
Of course I read it. Twice.

584
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:35,967
What did you think?

585
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:41,044
It's the best thing I ever read.
I didn't understand one word.

586
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:45,718
-What didn't you understand?
-None of it.

587
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:49,125
Here. Show me what.

588
00:45:58,169 --> 00:46:01,764
What's so funny?
That I'm blind, practically?

589
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:03,727
Practically blind.

590
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:06,284
-Practically blind?
-You're wonderful.

591
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:10,562
-I'm sorry I look funny to you.
-You look lovelier than ever.

592
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:14,159
You sound like one of those
ads for eyeglasses.

593
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:16,400
What didn't you understand?

594
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:20,966
Well, like the name of it:
''The Yellowing Democratic Manifesto.''

595
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:25,128
-Simple.
-To who? Whom? Who?

596
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:27,327
Well, anyway, not to me.

597
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:30,760
-You know what ''yellowing'' means.
-Not this time.

598
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:34,279
When a piece of paper gets old,
what happens to it?

599
00:46:34,689 --> 00:46:37,522
-Throw it away?
-No, it turns yellow.

600
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,367
-It does?
-Of course.

601
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:41,400
What do you know?

602
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:45,397
-You know what ''Democratic'' means.
-Not Republican.

603
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:49,004
Well, not exactly.

604
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:53,765
It means pertaining to our form
of government, which is a democracy.

605
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:57,759
-What's pertaining?
-'' Has to do with.''

606
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:00,284
Pertaining. Nice word.

607
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:03,162
-All right. '' Manifesto.''
-I don't know.

608
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:06,845
-Why didn't you look it up?
-I did. I still don't know.

609
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:11,726
By ''manifesto'' I mean the rules,
principles, ideals and hopes...

610
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,523
...on which the United States is based.

611
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:18,005
The ideas of the men who
wrote the Constitution.

612
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:20,803
-You think it's turning yellow?
-Yes.

613
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:24,206
The original inspiration
has been forgotten.

614
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:27,162
-And that's bad?
-And that's bad.

615
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:31,922
'' Even a--''

616
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:33,881
-''Cursory''?
-Cursory.

617
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:37,206
''--examination of contemporary...

618
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:40,009
...society in terms of the Greek...

619
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:43,963
...philosophy, which defines
the whole as a representation...

620
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:46,967
...of its parts,
sends one immediately...

621
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:50,963
...to the consideration of
the individual as a citizen...

622
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:54,087
...and the citizen as an individual.''

623
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:58,407
-Well?
-I looked up every word.

624
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:01,922
Listen.

625
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,519
Thousands of years ago,
a Greek philosopher said...

626
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:09,039
...the world could only be
as good as its inhabitants.

627
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:10,967
-Makes sense.
-So I said...

628
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,961
...take one look at America...

629
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:17,487
...and you figure you better look
at the people in it. One by one.

630
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:19,168
That's all.

631
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,157
-That's this?
-Sure.

632
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:24,963
Well, why didn't you say so?

633
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:15,361
-What's the name of this number?
-Beethoven's Second Symphony, Opus 36.

634
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:19,721
I didn't ask you who made it up.
I just asked the name of it.

635
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:39,360
Here. Wait a minute.

636
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:45,759
-There.
-Thanks.

637
00:49:49,009 --> 00:49:52,126
-I can't get over it.
-Music that bad?

638
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:56,767
-The music? Oh, it was swell.
-Well then, what?

639
00:49:57,169 --> 00:49:59,763
I got a letter today, from my father.

640
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,243
-New York?
-Yeah.

641
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:03,844
-I can't get over it.
-Why?

642
00:50:04,049 --> 00:50:07,644
It's the first time he wrote me
in about eight years.

643
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:13,168
We had a fight, sort of.
He didn't want me to go with Harry.

644
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:14,643
What does he do?

645
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:16,368
-My father?
-Yeah.

646
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:18,844
Gas company. He read meters...

647
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:22,365
...but he can't get around
so good anymore...

648
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:26,357
...so they gave him a different job.
Elevator man.

649
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:30,245
He's a goofy old guy.
He used to take a frying pan...

650
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:33,600
...to work every day
and cook his lunch.

651
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:37,159
He said everybody
should have a hot lunch.

652
00:50:38,049 --> 00:50:40,040
I don't know how he did it.

653
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:43,764
Four of us. Me and my three brothers.
He did everything.

654
00:50:43,969 --> 00:50:46,563
My mother died. I never knew her.

655
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:51,047
He used to feed us and give us
our bath and buy our clothes.

656
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,961
Everything.

657
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:59,083
All my life I used to think how
someday I'd like to pay him back.

658
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:05,162
It's funny how it worked out.

659
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:11,362
Once I brought home $1 00 and gave it
to him. You know what he did?

660
00:51:14,089 --> 00:51:17,286
Well, it sure didn't
do the plumbing no good.

661
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:23,166
I thought he'd hit me, but he didn't.
His whole life, he never hit me once.

662
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:27,485
How'd he happen to write you,
after all this time?

663
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:29,759
Because I wrote him.

664
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:33,360
He says he's thought about me
every day.

665
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:35,966
Gosh!

666
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:42,161
I haven't thought about him,
I bet once even, in five years.

667
00:51:43,169 --> 00:51:47,640
Oh, that's nothing against him.
I haven't thought of anything.

668
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:50,159
Be nice to see him, maybe.

669
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:52,407
I guess so.

670
00:51:52,649 --> 00:51:57,564
He says I should write again, and
I should have a hot lunch every day.

671
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:00,237
And I should let him know how I am.

672
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:04,801
But he won't see me if I'm still
living in any way unethical.

673
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:06,965
I looked it up.

674
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:09,962
He always said, '' Never do nothing...

675
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:13,957
...you wouldn't want printed
in the <i>New York Times. ''</i>

676
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:20,565
I practically told you the whole
story of my life by now.

677
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:23,199
I enjoyed it very much.

678
00:52:23,529 --> 00:52:27,158
-How about the story of your life?
-Oh, no.

679
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:29,360
Much too long...

680
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:32,359
...and mostly untrue.

681
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:07,279
This is even more gorgeous than
the Radio City Music Hall, even.

682
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:10,367
And do you notice? It smells nice.

683
00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:12,207
It does!

684
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:19,006
-Come on. Sit down.
-No.

685
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:20,961
You're tired.

686
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:24,757
I'm not a bit tired.

687
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:28,803
See?

688
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:31,887
You know the thing you gave me
about Napoleon?

689
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:34,045
-What?
-By Robert G. Ingersoll?

690
00:53:34,289 --> 00:53:36,519
-Oh, yes.
-I'm not sure I get it.

691
00:53:36,729 --> 00:53:39,482
-There's no deep meaning.
-There must be.

692
00:53:39,689 --> 00:53:42,647
He goes and looks in Napoleon's tomb...

693
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:45,682
...and he thinks
of Napoleon's sad life.

694
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,519
And then he says he himself
would have rather been a happy farmer.

695
00:53:50,729 --> 00:53:56,565
'' I would rather have been a French
peasant, and worn wooden shoes.

696
00:53:56,769 --> 00:54:01,445
I would rather have lived in a hut
with a vine growing over the door.

697
00:54:01,689 --> 00:54:05,762
And the grapes growing purple
in the kisses of the autumn sun.

698
00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:11,324
I would rather have been a poor
peasant, with my wife by my side...

699
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:14,566
...knitting as the day
died out of the sky...

700
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:18,967
...with my children upon my knee
and their arms about me.

701
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:22,122
I would rather have been that man...

702
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:26,561
...and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust...

703
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:31,001
...than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder...

704
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:33,763
...known as Napoleon the Great.''

705
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:38,959
How do you remember
all that stuff?

706
00:54:44,729 --> 00:54:48,847
So he'd rather be a happy peasant
than Napoleon. Who wouldn't?

707
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:51,085
Harry wouldn't, for one.

708
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:54,167
-What makes you think that?
-Ask him.

709
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:56,837
He probably never heard
of Napoleon.

710
00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:00,764
What's worse, he probably never
heard of a peasant.

711
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:04,046
Do you hate him like poison?

712
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:05,847
-Who? Harry?
-Yeah.

713
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:07,761
-No.
-You don't like him.

714
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:09,163
No.

715
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:12,879
-On account of me and him?
-One reason. There are lots more.

716
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:16,479
-What?
-Think about it. Harry's a menace.

717
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:19,044
He's not so bad. I seen worse.

718
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,002
Has he ever thought of anyone
but himself?

719
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:23,562
Who does?

720
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:27,045
History is the story
of the struggle between...

721
00:55:27,249 --> 00:55:30,605
-...the selfish and the unselfish.
-I can hear you.

722
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:33,602
All that's bad is bred by selfishness.

723
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:38,166
Sometimes selfishness can get to be
a cause, an organized force.

724
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:41,486
Even a government.
Then it's called fascism.

725
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:44,841
-Can you understand that?
-Sort of.

726
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:49,486
-Well, think about it.
-You're crazy about me, aren't you?

727
00:55:49,689 --> 00:55:52,886
-Yes.
-That's why you get so mad at Harry.

728
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:57,806
I hate his life, what he does,
what he stands for. Not him.

729
00:55:58,049 --> 00:56:02,964
-He just doesn't know any better.
-I go for you too.

730
00:56:04,129 --> 00:56:06,165
I'm glad of it.

731
00:56:20,689 --> 00:56:24,079
'' I've sworn upon the altar of God...

732
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:29,204
...eternal hostility against
every form of tyranny...

733
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:32,564
...over the mind of man.''

734
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:38,206
So that's Thomas Jefferson, huh?

735
00:56:38,409 --> 00:56:40,684
I heard quite a bit about him.

736
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:43,961
I mean even before
I hit town, even.

737
00:56:54,729 --> 00:56:56,162
Come in.

738
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:04,527
What are you trying to do
with those books, hatch them?

739
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,558
Blue?

740
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:11,368
Nice, that.

741
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:15,167
Beethoven. Op 36.

742
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:20,763
-What's up?
-It's because of you I'm doing this.

743
00:57:21,009 --> 00:57:23,159
-I guess you know.
-No, I didn't.

744
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:28,564
A lot of good it did me.
I never had this trouble before.

745
00:57:29,209 --> 00:57:31,518
-Trouble?
-Sure.

746
00:57:31,729 --> 00:57:35,927
When I met you, I figured everything
is gonna work out dandy.

747
00:57:36,129 --> 00:57:39,599
Then when you wouldn't
step across the line...

748
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:43,444
...I figured maybe the way
to you is through your head.

749
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:45,962
Well, no.

750
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:51,165
Well, anyway, what's the diff now?
Difference.

751
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:55,084
But I like you anyway.
It's too late for the rest.

752
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:58,008
-Why?
-Why?

753
00:57:58,249 --> 00:58:01,798
There's a certain time
between a fellow and a girl...

754
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:06,486
...when it either comes off or not.
If it doesn't then, it never does.

755
00:58:06,689 --> 00:58:12,321
-Maybe we haven't got to our time yet.
-I think so. You dropped the ball.

756
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:14,087
Don't be so sure.

757
00:58:14,769 --> 00:58:18,079
I never thought I'd
go through a thing like this.

758
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:21,326
-Like what?
-Like getting all mixed-up.

759
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:25,602
Like wondering and worrying
and thinking. Stuff like that.

760
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:30,724
Last night I started thinking.
I couldn't fall asleep for 1 0 minutes!

761
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:34,718
I don't know if it's good
to find out so much so quick.

762
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:39,684
Nobody's born smart. Know what
the stupidest thing on earth is? A baby.

763
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:41,959
What have you got against babies?

764
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:46,122
I've got nothing against a brain
that's three weeks old.

765
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:49,924
But if it's still empty after
30 years, I begin to wonder.

766
00:58:50,129 --> 00:58:52,563
-Who says I'm 30?
-I didn't--

767
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:54,088
-You did!
-I swear.

768
00:58:54,289 --> 00:58:56,598
-You sure can get me sore.
-Sorry.

769
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:58,720
-Do I look 30 to you?
-No.

770
00:58:58,929 --> 00:59:01,602
-Then why'd you say it?
-I don't know.

771
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:04,562
-How old are you?
-Twenty-nine!

772
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:10,207
Don't stop.

773
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:12,559
I meant, don't stop studying.

774
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:14,562
Will you?

775
00:59:15,209 --> 00:59:18,087
I don't know why
it's so important to you.

776
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:21,122
Sort of a cause.
I want everyone to be smart.

777
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,365
As smart as they can be.

778
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:26,282
A world of ignorant people
is dangerous.

779
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:31,688
-That's why I wish I was doing better.
-You're doing wonderfully.

780
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:35,962
Most people would laugh
if they knew what I was trying....

781
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:40,680
-I'm not laughing.
-I am. I'm sort of laughing at myself.

782
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:43,562
Who do I think I am, anyway?

783
00:59:50,049 --> 00:59:52,279
Once in a while, for a change.

784
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:55,606
Don't try so hard.
You miss the whole point.

785
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:59,922
-I wanna like what's best to like.
-You have room for a lot.

786
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:02,279
One learns to be bigger, not smaller.

787
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:04,599
-I'm getting bigger?
-Yes.

788
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:06,760
Glad to hear it.

789
01:00:07,089 --> 01:00:08,886
But all them books!

790
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:11,683
I told you, it's not only books.

791
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:13,720
-It's mostly.
-It is not.

792
01:00:13,929 --> 01:00:17,126
Who said, ''The proper study
of mankind is man''?

793
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:18,762
-Who?
-You should know.

794
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:19,958
-Why?
-I told you.

795
01:00:20,129 --> 01:00:21,357
-I forgot.
-Pope.

796
01:00:21,569 --> 01:00:25,118
-The pope?
-Not ''the pope.'' Alexander Pope.

797
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:29,608
-''The proper study--''
-''--of mankind is man.''

798
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:32,807
-Of course, that means women too.
-Yes.

799
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:34,562
Yes, I know.

800
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:38,480
I've been studying
different mankind lately.

801
01:00:38,689 --> 01:00:43,160
Like the ones you told me.
Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine.

802
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:46,719
And all by myself
I got to thinking about Harry.

803
01:00:47,169 --> 01:00:50,957
He works so hard
to get what he wants, for instance.

804
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:53,524
But he doesn't know what he wants.

805
01:00:53,729 --> 01:00:56,721
-More of what he's got, probably.
-Money.

806
01:00:56,929 --> 01:01:00,478
Money, more people to push around,
more money.

807
01:01:00,689 --> 01:01:03,442
He's not so bad as you think he is.

808
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:07,360
We were just talking about you.

809
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:12,125
That ain't why I pay you.
She knows enough about me. Too much.

810
01:01:12,329 --> 01:01:14,889
Jim phone? I had a date with him.

811
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:17,603
-What about Paine?
-He was quite a fellow.

812
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:21,558
-Where was he born?
-London or England. A place like that.

813
01:01:21,769 --> 01:01:24,886
-London or--? It's the same thing.
-It is?

814
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:28,764
London's a city
in the country of England.

815
01:01:28,969 --> 01:01:30,925
-You got patience.
-Take it easy.

816
01:01:31,129 --> 01:01:34,565
-How can she be so dumb?
-We can't all know everything.

817
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:37,767
-Who's Tom Paine, for instance?
-What?

818
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:41,206
-You heard me. Tom Paine.
-What do I care?

819
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:42,398
I know.

820
01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:46,363
If I wanted to know who he is,
I'd know. I don't care.

821
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:49,720
-Don't let me butt in.
-Which book did you like?

822
01:01:49,929 --> 01:01:53,399
I didn't read by him.
Only about him. I made a list.

823
01:01:53,649 --> 01:01:55,958
-Who's ''Rabbit'' Maranville?
-Who?

824
01:01:56,169 --> 01:01:58,888
-''Rabbit'' Maranville.
-I don't know rabbits.

825
01:01:59,089 --> 01:02:02,968
-Think you're smart, huh?
-He was shortstop for the Braves.

826
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:05,882
-What are you? Some kind of genius?
-No.

827
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:09,001
-I hire and fire geniuses every day.
-I'm sure.

828
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:10,927
-Where's the list?
-Here.

829
01:02:11,129 --> 01:02:14,166
Suppose you start
with <i>The Age of Reason.</i>

830
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:16,604
<i>-The Age of Reason</i>?
-Then, next--

831
01:02:16,809 --> 01:02:19,403
-Who's Willie Hop?
-Billiard champion.

832
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:22,368
-It's pronounced ''Hoppe.''
-I asked her.

833
01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:25,561
-Sorry. Where were we?
<i>-The Age of Reason.</i>

834
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:29,006
-Yes. Next, <i>The Rights of Man.</i>
<i>-The Rights of Man.</i>

835
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,365
-I think--
-What's a peninsula?

836
01:02:31,609 --> 01:02:34,567
You think you're so smart?
What's a peninsula?

837
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:38,722
-Not you. Her.
-It's that new medicine.

838
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:42,362
It is not.

839
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:45,319
-What then?
-A body of land...

840
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:47,918
...surrounded on three sides
by water.

841
01:02:48,129 --> 01:02:50,962
-So what?
-So what about Sam Paine?

842
01:02:51,169 --> 01:02:54,684
Some difference between--
Tom Paine! Not Sam Paine!

843
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:58,962
Tom Paine practically started
this whole country.

844
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:01,805
-You mean he's dead?
-Of course.

845
01:03:02,049 --> 01:03:05,678
I want you to learn her how to act
with live people.

846
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:08,528
Education's difficult to control--

847
01:03:08,729 --> 01:03:10,765
-Work on her.
-No extra charge.

848
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:14,086
-I don't need nothing you can tell me.
-We could...

849
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:17,008
...tell each other some
interesting things.

850
01:03:17,209 --> 01:03:19,359
-What's the idea?
-Being friendly.

851
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:20,922
Who asked you?

852
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:23,883
The more I see you
I don't like you as much.

853
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:25,966
You're awful fresh.

854
01:03:26,209 --> 01:03:30,168
-Watch out. I got my eye on you.
-Okay. We'll both watch out.

855
01:03:30,409 --> 01:03:33,685
-I could knock your block off.
-Yes, I know.

856
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:37,120
Just do what you're supposed
to do, that's all.

857
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:38,523
We'll stop now.

858
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:41,880
-Go on. I wanna see how you do it.
-Not now.

859
01:03:42,089 --> 01:03:45,559
I've gotta lie down.
You don't realize how hard I work.

860
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:46,963
Some joke!

861
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:51,919
-200 bucks a week and I can't watch.
-Take you on separately. Glad to.

862
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:55,565
Got a special course
for backward millionaires.

863
01:04:01,209 --> 01:04:06,158
'' London or England.''
Why don't you give up?

864
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:18,919
-Harry?
-What?

865
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:23,528
What's this business we're in
down here? Could you tell me?

866
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:25,321
What do you mean, ''we''?

867
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:29,158
-I figure I'm a partner, in a way.
-A silent partner.

868
01:04:29,409 --> 01:04:31,764
-So?
-So shut up.

869
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:35,001
I got a right to know.

870
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:38,167
Keep out of my hair.
Put your nose in a book.

871
01:04:38,369 --> 01:04:41,406
I don't want to do anything
against the law.

872
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:43,088
Do what I tell you.

873
01:04:43,289 --> 01:04:46,167
I think I know what it is,
only I'm not sure.

874
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:48,803
What's the matter?
You do all right.

875
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:51,609
Something you want
you ain't got, maybe?

876
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:57,563
-What?
-I wanna be like the happy peasant.

877
01:04:58,529 --> 01:05:02,886
All right, I'll buy it for you.
Now will you quit crabbing?

878
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:06,760
I finished finally.
Thanks loads for the loan.

879
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,164
-How'd you like it?
-Oh, not me.

880
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:13,282
I don't like when everyone
has a beef against the world.

881
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:17,198
-I like to look on the cheerful side.
-Well, the point--

882
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:22,728
-Can the coffee klatch. You, knock off.
-Sorry, Mr. Brock.

883
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:26,368
-Don't get so pally.
-Paul says it's okay.

884
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:29,965
-Never mind him. I don't like it.
-Know what you are?

885
01:05:30,169 --> 01:05:31,363
What?

886
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:43,446
-Antisocial!
-You can say that again.

887
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:46,001
Where you guys been?

888
01:05:46,249 --> 01:05:47,921
-Sorry.
-You're always sorry.

889
01:05:48,129 --> 01:05:51,007
-My fault. How do you do?
-How do you do?

890
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:55,521
-How are you, Billie?
-Superb. A new word.

891
01:05:56,409 --> 01:05:59,958
-All right, what happened?
-It may take more time--

892
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:01,841
-And more money.
-Why more?

893
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:04,927
The amendment has to be redrafted.

894
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:11,367
-You make me feel like a sucker.
-NorvaI's doing his best.

895
01:06:11,569 --> 01:06:14,959
-It ain't good enough.
-There are a lot of votes.

896
01:06:15,169 --> 01:06:17,967
-NorvaI's just one guy.
-He's the wrong guy.

897
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:21,281
I'm sick of waiting.

898
01:06:21,489 --> 01:06:25,960
Pull your weight in this deal
or I'll get somebody who can.

899
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:29,008
Quite a temper.

900
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:34,767
Don't mind him. He's always lived
at the top of his voice. So long, Norval.

901
01:06:48,209 --> 01:06:52,407
Harry shouldn't talk to you like that.
You're a congressman.

902
01:06:52,649 --> 01:06:53,843
Oh, well.

903
01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:58,520
No one should talk to a congressman
like that, or be able to.

904
01:06:59,009 --> 01:07:02,968
-Being a congressman is wonderful.
-Thank you.

905
01:07:03,209 --> 01:07:05,564
I think I could use a drink.

906
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:09,125
Oh, sure, congressman. Come on in.

907
01:07:10,009 --> 01:07:14,605
If he pushes you around, he's
pushing a few million people around.

908
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:16,999
-Who?
-The ones who picked you.

909
01:07:17,249 --> 01:07:19,524
-Not quite that many.
-How many?

910
01:07:19,729 --> 01:07:22,801
306,434.

911
01:07:23,049 --> 01:07:25,961
That's quite a few to push around.

912
01:07:26,169 --> 01:07:30,560
You're not one of my constituents
by any chance, are you?

913
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:41,886
-One of the people who voted for me?
-Oh, I never voted for anybody.

914
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:44,319
-Why not?
-I wouldn't know how.

915
01:07:44,529 --> 01:07:48,363
-Simple. You just press a button.
-Yeah. But which one?

916
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:53,962
You listen to the speeches.
You make up your own mind. That's all.

917
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:56,364
Why do you take it from Harry?

918
01:07:56,569 --> 01:08:00,562
You're more important than him.
You're a congressman.

919
01:08:00,769 --> 01:08:03,966
Yes, and as such,
I have a great many duties...

920
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:06,928
...and responsibilities and....

921
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:10,360
The operation of government
is very complex.

922
01:08:10,609 --> 01:08:15,319
Why should it be? I understand it in
the books, and when Paul tells me.

923
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:18,680
But when I see this
happen, it's different.

924
01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:20,083
How?

925
01:08:20,289 --> 01:08:24,805
When it's a matter of the law,
is Harry more important than others?

926
01:08:24,969 --> 01:08:25,958
No.

927
01:08:26,089 --> 01:08:30,765
Then how come he's got so much to say?
Who ever voted for him?

928
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:38,567
Well, we'll have a nice,
long talk about it sometime.

929
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:41,961
All right.

930
01:08:42,209 --> 01:08:44,404
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

931
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:46,361
And thank you.

932
01:08:55,569 --> 01:08:57,560
Quite a little girl.

933
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,527
-Billie?
-Come in.

934
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:05,768
Will you come inside?
A few things for you.

935
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:17,363
Sign those, will you, honey?

936
01:09:20,009 --> 01:09:22,523
-What is this?
-Same old stuff.

937
01:09:22,729 --> 01:09:26,165
-What?
-Take too long to explain.

938
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:30,800
I like having things explained
to me. I found that out.

939
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:33,768
-Some other time.
-Now.

940
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:38,167
-It's an agreement about a merger.
-Merger?

941
01:09:38,409 --> 01:09:42,084
-What's that?
-Several companies becoming one.

942
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:44,280
-All Harry's?
-No.

943
01:09:44,489 --> 01:09:45,558
Whose, then?

944
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:49,762
A few of Harry's and some others.
French, Italian and so on.

945
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:51,925
A cartel!

946
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:56,679
-What are you talking about?
-Cartels. I'm against it.

947
01:09:56,889 --> 01:09:58,481
Paul explained it to me.

948
01:09:58,689 --> 01:10:01,681
-It's perfectly all right.
-Are you sure?

949
01:10:01,889 --> 01:10:03,368
-Ask Harry.
-I will.

950
01:10:03,609 --> 01:10:05,281
-He won't like it.
-Why not?

951
01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:09,004
-He doesn't like people butting in.
-I'm not '' people.''

952
01:10:09,249 --> 01:10:10,887
Listen to me. Be smart.

953
01:10:11,089 --> 01:10:14,001
How can I be smart if nobody
tells me anything?

954
01:10:14,209 --> 01:10:15,642
I'll tell you something.

955
01:10:15,809 --> 01:10:18,926
-Sign this. Don't start with him.
-Tomorrow.

956
01:10:19,169 --> 01:10:20,158
Why tomorrow?

957
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:23,207
-I wanna look it over.
-It's all right.

958
01:10:23,569 --> 01:10:25,958
Must be fishy or you'd tell me.

959
01:10:26,209 --> 01:10:27,927
Take my word for it.

960
01:10:29,409 --> 01:10:30,637
No.

961
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:34,922
I know you feel bad.
You don't like doing his dirty work.

962
01:10:35,129 --> 01:10:38,565
-You know you're better than him.
-That's enough!

963
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:42,762
But I'm not so sure.
Maybe you're worse.

964
01:11:40,769 --> 01:11:44,318
-Interesting?
-Not very.

965
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:47,766
You're used to reading
more high-toned stuff.

966
01:11:48,009 --> 01:11:49,920
Yes, I am.

967
01:11:50,329 --> 01:11:52,524
-What's the matter, kid?
-Nothing.

968
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:55,721
-All of a sudden--
-I don't like that Jim.

969
01:11:55,929 --> 01:11:58,762
Why? What'd he do to you?

970
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:02,684
He didn't do anything to me.
It's what he's done to himself.

971
01:12:02,889 --> 01:12:04,117
Done what?

972
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:09,119
Paul said he could have been Assistant
Attorney General of the United States.

973
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:12,003
-Who?
-Jim.

974
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:17,159
-So what's wrong with that?
-So nothing's wrong. Look at him now.

975
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:20,759
Hangs around. Helps you promote.

976
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:25,121
Lets you walk all over him
just because you pay him.

977
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:28,681
So we finally get around to me.

978
01:12:30,009 --> 01:12:35,561
I'm not sure I like you, either.
You're selfish, that's your trouble.

979
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:39,119
-Since when is all this?
-Since now.

980
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:44,762
I used to think you were a big man.
I'm beginning to see you're not.

981
01:12:45,009 --> 01:12:49,048
Through history there's been bigger
men than you. Now too.

982
01:12:49,249 --> 01:12:50,568
-Who?
-Thousands.

983
01:12:50,769 --> 01:12:52,521
Name one.

984
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:54,527
My father.

985
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,524
Twenty-five a week.

986
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:01,560
Don't get nervous just because
you read a book.

987
01:13:01,769 --> 01:13:04,158
-You're as dumb as ever.
-Think so?

988
01:13:04,409 --> 01:13:08,607
Yeah, but I don't mind. You know why?
Because you're the greatest--

989
01:13:08,809 --> 01:13:10,800
-Leave me alone!
-Come here!

990
01:13:11,049 --> 01:13:14,405
-I feel like I wanna go away someplace!
-Where?

991
01:13:14,609 --> 01:13:17,123
-We'll go to Florida.
-I mean alone.

992
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:19,889
-You've gone nuts! Calm down!
-I can't!

993
01:13:20,089 --> 01:13:21,681
-Why not?
-I don't know!

994
01:13:21,889 --> 01:13:24,767
I hate my life.
There's a better kind.

995
01:13:25,009 --> 01:13:29,958
If you'd read some books you'd know.
Maybe you're right. I'm still dumb.

996
01:13:30,209 --> 01:13:34,760
But I know there's a better
kind of life than the one I got.

997
01:13:35,009 --> 01:13:36,920
Or you!

998
01:13:37,849 --> 01:13:40,761
You'd rather be with
that saxophone player?

999
01:13:40,969 --> 01:13:43,688
-At least he was honest!
-He was a chump.

1000
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:47,086
-He worked for a living.
-I worked since I was 1 2.

1001
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:50,759
-Nobody give me nothing.
-Robbing a house is work too.

1002
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:53,119
In my whole life--!

1003
01:13:58,329 --> 01:14:00,559
I never robbed a house in my life!

1004
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,966
-What are you talking about?
-You can't understand.

1005
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:06,558
Get off that high horse,
you dumb pot!

1006
01:14:06,769 --> 01:14:07,963
You...

1007
01:14:08,169 --> 01:14:09,727
...menace!

1008
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:14,561
You never had a decent meal
until you met me!

1009
01:14:14,769 --> 01:14:17,966
But I had to eat with you!
You got no manners.

1010
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:22,088
Taking your shoes off all the time
and picking your teeth.

1011
01:14:22,289 --> 01:14:24,723
You're just not couth!

1012
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:33,724
I'm as couth as you are!

1013
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:39,199
-And that cheap perfume you put on.
-Cheap?

1014
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:42,879
I don't own nothing cheap except you.

1015
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:47,328
You don't own me. Nobody can
own anybody. The law says.

1016
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:50,965
-If I was scared, I wouldn't be here.
-Where are you?

1017
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:54,320
You don't like it here, beat it!

1018
01:14:56,329 --> 01:14:59,366
-Wait a minute! First this.
-Not now.

1019
01:14:59,609 --> 01:15:00,758
-Right now!
-No!

1020
01:15:01,009 --> 01:15:04,319
I won't sign anything
till I know what it is.

1021
01:15:04,609 --> 01:15:06,918
Do what I'm telling you!

1022
01:15:08,609 --> 01:15:10,725
Harry, please don't!

1023
01:15:17,009 --> 01:15:18,522
There.

1024
01:15:32,209 --> 01:15:34,518
All right, now go on. Blow.

1025
01:15:35,249 --> 01:15:39,527
I don't want you bawling here.
You don't appreciate nothing.

1026
01:15:39,729 --> 01:15:45,122
Go sit on a park bench until you learn
how to behave. Go on, beat it!

1027
01:15:48,329 --> 01:15:50,320
This way out.

1028
01:15:50,809 --> 01:15:52,481
I gotta put something on.

1029
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:56,318
Hurry up. I don't want you around.
You bother me!

1030
01:16:00,209 --> 01:16:02,928
Big fascist!

1031
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,927
All set?

1032
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:30,766
You think I'm gonna
let a broad talk back?

1033
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:35,161
-Where is she?
-She's leaving. I can't stand a crier.

1034
01:16:35,409 --> 01:16:38,321
-What's she crying about?
-How do I know?

1035
01:16:39,449 --> 01:16:41,246
Becoming a strange girl.

1036
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:44,964
She's all right. It's these books.
They got her nervous.

1037
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:47,518
Educating her was a mistake.

1038
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:52,519
I didn't know it would be like this.
I'll fire that Verrall skunk.

1039
01:16:52,729 --> 01:16:53,684
Why blame him?

1040
01:16:53,889 --> 01:16:59,566
He taught her too much. You know
what she called me? A ''fatch-ist'' !

1041
01:16:59,769 --> 01:17:04,320
That don't make sense. I was born
in New Jersey. She knows that.

1042
01:17:06,609 --> 01:17:08,725
What's the matter, Harry?

1043
01:17:12,489 --> 01:17:14,923
I love that broad.

1044
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:21,324
You think we could find somebody
to make her dumb again?

1045
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:32,719
Don't be late if you don't
want no bloody nose.

1046
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:38,679
-Would you do me a favor, Harry?
-What?

1047
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:41,323
Drop dead.

1048
01:18:32,889 --> 01:18:36,928
<i>I have sworn upon the Altar of God...</i>

1049
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:39,843
<i>... eternal hostility...</i>

1050
01:18:40,289 --> 01:18:43,520
<i>...against every form of tyranny...</i>

1051
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:47,288
<i>... Over the mind of man.</i>

1052
01:19:02,369 --> 01:19:04,758
Oh, hello. Chestnut-7 1 80.

1053
01:19:05,009 --> 01:19:08,718
I'd like to speak to
Thomas Jefferson, please.

1054
01:19:08,969 --> 01:19:12,325
Oh, no. I mean Thomas Verrall.

1055
01:19:13,609 --> 01:19:16,487
No, Paul Verrall. Paul Verrall.

1056
01:19:16,689 --> 01:19:19,123
Well, it's very important.

1057
01:19:20,409 --> 01:19:22,718
Well, I'll hold on.

1058
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:35,160
-Jim!
-Yes?

1059
01:19:35,369 --> 01:19:37,087
-What time is it?
-1 1 :30.

1060
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:40,042
-I'll slug her when she gets back.
-If.

1061
01:19:40,249 --> 01:19:44,925
-She always winds up where I want her.
-I hope so.

1062
01:20:01,489 --> 01:20:02,365
Jim!

1063
01:20:02,609 --> 01:20:04,247
-What time is it?
-1 1 :30.

1064
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:07,805
-You said that before.
-1 1 :31 .

1065
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:12,919
-She's been gone eight hours.
-Maybe she's seeing a double feature.

1066
01:20:13,129 --> 01:20:15,927
That don't take eight hours.

1067
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:18,969
-Could've had an accident.
-You'd hear.

1068
01:20:19,209 --> 01:20:22,360
Could have got attacked.
Happens all the time.

1069
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:27,125
Not to Billie. Maybe the other
way around. But not to her.

1070
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:42,003
She here?

1071
01:20:42,209 --> 01:20:44,518
What do you mean?
No. Look some more.

1072
01:20:44,729 --> 01:20:47,766
-I been all over town.
-Well, go over it again.

1073
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:52,884
-Do what I'm telling you.
-Sure. Just changing my socks.

1074
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,367
-Harry.
-What?

1075
01:20:56,609 --> 01:20:58,520
Marry her.

1076
01:20:59,609 --> 01:21:00,928
Still harping?

1077
01:21:01,129 --> 01:21:03,848
I'm thinking of your legal safety.
She--

1078
01:21:04,049 --> 01:21:05,880
I know what she owns.

1079
01:21:06,089 --> 01:21:08,284
You've got to do it, Harry.

1080
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:13,324
Broads always hook you in the end.
All this because a dame reads a book.

1081
01:21:13,529 --> 01:21:16,885
It's the new world.
Force and reason changing places.

1082
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:19,478
-What?
-Knowledge is power.

1083
01:21:19,689 --> 01:21:23,159
I don't like this. You stewed,
that broad out of line.

1084
01:21:23,409 --> 01:21:26,128
-And some congressman!
-I think he's cute.

1085
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:27,967
I'd like to trade him in.

1086
01:21:28,169 --> 01:21:30,080
-On what?
-On a senator!

1087
01:21:30,289 --> 01:21:31,768
On a senator?

1088
01:21:32,009 --> 01:21:36,560
Take the blinders off and let in
the light. Just for a second.

1089
01:21:36,769 --> 01:21:41,559
You can't buy senators and congressmen
as if they wore price tags.

1090
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:45,324
These guys are honest.
Sincerely trying to do a job.

1091
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:49,477
Sometimes you find
a rotten apple, like Hedges.

1092
01:21:49,689 --> 01:21:53,523
But just once in a while.
In a great while.

1093
01:22:25,409 --> 01:22:29,482
Are you sure you're ringing
Mr. Brock's suite, operator?

1094
01:22:29,689 --> 01:22:32,249
Well, how about the bedroom?

1095
01:22:32,769 --> 01:22:35,488
Ring a few more times.
I wanna make sure.

1096
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:38,681
-He's not in.
-Just one more ring.

1097
01:22:40,769 --> 01:22:42,088
Let's go.

1098
01:22:52,769 --> 01:22:55,363
The stuff's in his briefcase.

1099
01:22:55,569 --> 01:22:57,525
In his bedroom.

1100
01:22:59,969 --> 01:23:03,166
I probably won't see you again, Paul.

1101
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:05,280
-I wanna say goodbye.
-What?

1102
01:23:05,489 --> 01:23:08,128
-And thanks.
-Where are you going?

1103
01:23:08,329 --> 01:23:11,924
-Away from here, that's all I know.
-Where?

1104
01:23:12,689 --> 01:23:14,361
You can tell me.

1105
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:18,721
I don't know. I thought
I might go see my father for a while.

1106
01:23:18,969 --> 01:23:21,563
-I've got a better idea.
-What?

1107
01:23:21,769 --> 01:23:23,919
Let's get married.

1108
01:23:25,409 --> 01:23:28,128
You must be daffy.

1109
01:23:28,809 --> 01:23:31,004
I love you, Billie.

1110
01:23:32,689 --> 01:23:35,726
You don't love me.
You just love my brain.

1111
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:37,527
That too.

1112
01:23:38,369 --> 01:23:43,284
I'll think it over, but I can
tell you now, the answer's no.

1113
01:23:49,009 --> 01:23:51,239
What are you doing?

1114
01:23:51,449 --> 01:23:54,646
If you don't know,
I must be doing it wrong.

1115
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:10,520
Fine time!

1116
01:24:14,809 --> 01:24:17,528
-Hello, Harry.
-Where you been?

1117
01:24:17,769 --> 01:24:21,444
I took a walk, like you told me.
I met Paul.

1118
01:24:21,649 --> 01:24:24,117
Okay, buster, knock off.

1119
01:24:26,489 --> 01:24:28,081
Good night, Paul.

1120
01:24:28,489 --> 01:24:31,481
Good night, Billie.
Good night, Harry.

1121
01:24:32,769 --> 01:24:36,205
What's the matter, Harry?
You miss me?

1122
01:24:51,929 --> 01:24:54,762
I got something to say
and I don't like to wait.

1123
01:24:54,969 --> 01:24:55,845
I know.

1124
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,483
-Now I'm not so sure.
-Why not?

1125
01:24:58,689 --> 01:25:02,125
Talking fresh, slamming doors.
I knew you'd be back.

1126
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:04,724
-You did?
-Jim was worried, not me.

1127
01:25:04,969 --> 01:25:06,687
Not yet.

1128
01:25:07,049 --> 01:25:10,166
-What took you so long?
-I had a lot to think.

1129
01:25:10,369 --> 01:25:12,929
-For instance?
-Where I stand around here.

1130
01:25:13,129 --> 01:25:14,960
-I'm trying to tell you.
-What?

1131
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:16,437
Where you stand.

1132
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:20,119
First, Verrall is out.
I don't like to see you upset.

1133
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:22,485
-Next, we'll get married.
-No.

1134
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:24,839
But you gotta behave--
No?

1135
01:25:25,049 --> 01:25:28,519
-What do you mean, ''no''?
-I don't wanna, that's what.

1136
01:25:28,729 --> 01:25:33,484
-In fact, I've never been so insulted!
-Who are you to say no?

1137
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:37,921
Don't knock yourself out.
You got a lot of surprises coming.

1138
01:25:42,489 --> 01:25:44,047
-Just tell me.
-What?

1139
01:25:44,249 --> 01:25:47,639
-How can you not wanna marry me?
-For one, you're dumb.

1140
01:25:47,849 --> 01:25:52,718
I got a different kind of life in mind.
Sorry, you wouldn't fit in.

1141
01:25:52,969 --> 01:25:55,483
-I don't understand!
-I do.

1142
01:25:55,689 --> 01:25:57,281
What did I do?

1143
01:25:57,489 --> 01:26:02,119
I talked rough to you. Maybe I hit you
a couple of times. Easy.

1144
01:26:02,369 --> 01:26:05,122
Is that any reason
to treat me like this?

1145
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:08,481
I done good too.
Can't we straighten it out?

1146
01:26:08,689 --> 01:26:10,281
-No.
-Why not?

1147
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:15,967
All that stuff I've been studying,
it just mixed me up.

1148
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:18,080
But when you hit me before...

1149
01:26:18,289 --> 01:26:22,965
...it was like it all knocked
together in my head and made sense.

1150
01:26:23,209 --> 01:26:24,927
I realized what it means.

1151
01:26:25,169 --> 01:26:30,118
How some people are always giving it,
and some taking. And it's not fair.

1152
01:26:30,369 --> 01:26:34,487
So I'm not gonna let you anymore.
Or anybody else.

1153
01:26:36,409 --> 01:26:39,879
Listen, kid. I got an idea.
You wanna come to Florida?

1154
01:26:41,889 --> 01:26:45,518
We used to have some good times
together. Remember?

1155
01:26:45,969 --> 01:26:48,722
I think you should
marry me. Don't you?

1156
01:26:48,929 --> 01:26:53,320
I want you to marry me.
Do what I tell you or you'll be sorry.

1157
01:26:53,569 --> 01:26:58,484
-I'm not scared of you anymore, Harry.
-You're not, huh?

1158
01:27:01,329 --> 01:27:04,048
-And something else. I'm leaving.
-What?

1159
01:27:04,249 --> 01:27:05,682
For good.

1160
01:27:06,049 --> 01:27:08,324
You just can't walk out.

1161
01:27:08,569 --> 01:27:12,687
You're in too deep. I was wrong
hooking you in, but you're in.

1162
01:27:12,889 --> 01:27:15,847
-I'm not gonna be.
-You wanna wash it up?

1163
01:27:16,049 --> 01:27:19,724
Fine! I'm too important
to monkey around with you.

1164
01:27:19,929 --> 01:27:22,682
Jim! Jim, wake up!

1165
01:27:25,369 --> 01:27:26,518
What is it?

1166
01:27:26,769 --> 01:27:31,524
-Come on, you've got some work to do.
-All right. Be right with you.

1167
01:27:31,769 --> 01:27:34,078
Okay. Well, get a move on!

1168
01:27:35,929 --> 01:27:39,285
I'll fix it so you're out.
You're spoiled. I spoiled you.

1169
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:44,119
I was gonna make you be a real partner.
You don't want it? Fine!

1170
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:48,567
And you don't look like you used to.
I'll be glad to be rid of you.

1171
01:27:48,769 --> 01:27:51,124
And as far as I'm concerned....

1172
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,486
Vice versa.

1173
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:58,127
You're back.

1174
01:27:58,369 --> 01:27:59,722
-All set?
-Shut up!

1175
01:27:59,929 --> 01:28:02,887
Settle things up
and get her out of here.

1176
01:28:03,089 --> 01:28:05,523
-Are you sure?
-First time I am.

1177
01:28:05,729 --> 01:28:08,766
-Where's that stuff?
-In your bedroom.

1178
01:28:08,969 --> 01:28:11,324
-No!
-What do you mean, ''no''?

1179
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:15,482
I mean, let's take the shortcut.
The sooner, the better.

1180
01:28:22,289 --> 01:28:24,280
They're in the bottom drawer.

1181
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:34,881
-Blue covers?
-Yeah.

1182
01:28:36,209 --> 01:28:39,087
-Three copies?
-That's right.

1183
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:42,320
Paul took them.

1184
01:28:43,209 --> 01:28:44,483
-When?
-Just now.

1185
01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:45,678
What for?

1186
01:28:46,089 --> 01:28:49,286
Why do you think?
To put in the newspapers.

1187
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:52,083
-Some jokes I don't like.
-It's no joke.

1188
01:28:52,289 --> 01:28:54,564
Paul says it's
the biggest swindle...

1189
01:28:54,809 --> 01:28:57,801
...since ''the teapot.''
Something like that.

1190
01:28:58,969 --> 01:29:00,846
Why are you getting so white?

1191
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:04,121
You told me it was perfectly
all right.

1192
01:29:04,329 --> 01:29:07,048
-You double-crossing--
-It's not like that.

1193
01:29:07,249 --> 01:29:11,606
If there's a fire and I call
the engines, who am I double-crossing?

1194
01:29:11,809 --> 01:29:13,720
The fire?

1195
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,522
If this breaks,
nobody will play with us.

1196
01:29:20,769 --> 01:29:24,284
-What's to do?
-Might be best to call it off.

1197
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:26,719
-What?
-Let him publish--

1198
01:29:26,969 --> 01:29:30,166
I've spent a lot of dough.
Just let that ride?

1199
01:29:30,409 --> 01:29:32,479
-Play it safe.
-I want my deal.

1200
01:29:32,689 --> 01:29:36,045
-Gonna be tough to get.
-Because of some weasel?

1201
01:29:36,249 --> 01:29:37,477
-Harry--
-You're chicken!

1202
01:29:37,689 --> 01:29:38,724
-Think so?
-Yes.

1203
01:29:38,929 --> 01:29:42,717
-I've been right and you've been wrong.
-Shut up!

1204
01:29:42,929 --> 01:29:44,726
I'll handle this.

1205
01:29:45,049 --> 01:29:46,721
All right.

1206
01:29:52,369 --> 01:29:55,042
-Looking for someone?
-Billie.

1207
01:29:55,449 --> 01:29:57,121
Come on in.

1208
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,119
-Billie!
-Gee, I'm tired. I was down--

1209
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:08,925
-I think you got something of mine.
-That so?

1210
01:30:18,769 --> 01:30:20,521
How about it?

1211
01:30:25,769 --> 01:30:27,327
Sit down.

1212
01:30:33,209 --> 01:30:34,847
-Hello.
-How you been?

1213
01:30:35,049 --> 01:30:36,323
-Fine, you?
-Fine.

1214
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:40,364
-Go to his place and get the stuff.
-It's not there.

1215
01:30:40,569 --> 01:30:42,127
Where then?

1216
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:46,288
You wanna play rough?
I can do that too.

1217
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:52,839
I mean business.
I got too much at stake.

1218
01:30:53,049 --> 01:30:56,121
You wanna get out alive,
you better give it back.

1219
01:30:56,329 --> 01:30:59,685
-I'm no blowhard. Tell him.
-He's no blowhard.

1220
01:30:59,889 --> 01:31:03,245
He's had people killed before.
About six years ago--

1221
01:31:03,449 --> 01:31:06,282
You ain't gonna tell
nobody nothing soon.

1222
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:10,438
-Double negative! Right?
-Right.

1223
01:31:12,209 --> 01:31:15,918
You're gonna be in trouble
unless you do what I say.

1224
01:31:16,169 --> 01:31:19,320
Wait. There's another way
to handle this.

1225
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:22,839
You've pulled a boner, friend.
My advice is lay off.

1226
01:31:23,049 --> 01:31:25,517
Stop sticking your noses
in my business.

1227
01:31:25,729 --> 01:31:28,323
You're the biggest buttinsky
I ever met.

1228
01:31:28,569 --> 01:31:32,881
That's my job. Your papers are
in the mail, addressed to myself.

1229
01:31:33,089 --> 01:31:35,728
-Your job? Getting in my way?
-Not exactly.

1230
01:31:35,969 --> 01:31:37,925
What, then? I'd like to know.

1231
01:31:38,129 --> 01:31:41,485
To find out what goes on
and get it to the people.

1232
01:31:41,689 --> 01:31:43,088
-What people?
-''The'' people.

1233
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:45,598
-Never heard of them.
-You will.

1234
01:31:45,809 --> 01:31:48,277
They're more well-known
all the time.

1235
01:31:48,489 --> 01:31:53,517
-And if we're operating within the law?
-Then the law needs revision.

1236
01:31:53,729 --> 01:31:55,640
-Are you the government?
-Yes.

1237
01:31:55,889 --> 01:31:58,722
-Since when?
-Since 1 7 7 9. Right?

1238
01:31:58,969 --> 01:32:00,322
Right.

1239
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:03,079
What do you think you've got?

1240
01:32:03,249 --> 01:32:06,321
Harry's connection
to Hedge's amendment.

1241
01:32:06,529 --> 01:32:08,759
-Why single us out?
-Yeah, why?

1242
01:32:08,969 --> 01:32:11,722
What we're doing is done every day.

1243
01:32:11,929 --> 01:32:16,923
Murders could go undiscovered
every day. What does that prove?

1244
01:32:17,169 --> 01:32:22,368
Undercover pressure, bribery,
corruption, government between friends!

1245
01:32:22,569 --> 01:32:26,482
It's tough to crack.
Ask me, I've tried for years.

1246
01:32:26,689 --> 01:32:30,318
You need more than knowing.
You gotta have facts.

1247
01:32:30,569 --> 01:32:34,482
-And most important, the names.
-He's got them.

1248
01:32:35,209 --> 01:32:39,327
All right. Let's get down to it.
What will you take, Paul?

1249
01:32:39,569 --> 01:32:41,127
I'll take a drink.

1250
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:43,963
I ain't met a guy
didn't have his price.

1251
01:32:44,169 --> 01:32:46,000
-I have.
-I mean big numbers!

1252
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:50,447
You'll be wearing
a big number across your chest!

1253
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:52,719
I'll get to you later.

1254
01:32:52,929 --> 01:32:57,445
There's two ways to do this. One,
play ball. Two, watch your step...

1255
01:32:57,649 --> 01:33:02,518
...because there's no place you can
live if you monkey-wrench me.

1256
01:33:02,729 --> 01:33:04,526
What do you say?

1257
01:33:06,769 --> 01:33:11,126
-I'd like to think it over.
-All right. You got two minutes.

1258
01:33:34,129 --> 01:33:35,926
Come on, Billie.

1259
01:33:37,569 --> 01:33:39,127
Wait a minute, Harry!

1260
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:40,722
Cut it out, Harry!

1261
01:33:40,929 --> 01:33:44,126
-Operator!
-Behave yourself.

1262
01:33:47,329 --> 01:33:51,322
You stupid fool.
What do you think you are?

1263
01:33:51,529 --> 01:33:55,283
This muscle stuff is a thing
of the past. Cut it out!

1264
01:33:55,489 --> 01:33:56,888
I got mad.

1265
01:33:57,449 --> 01:33:58,928
Who are you to get mad?

1266
01:33:59,169 --> 01:34:02,718
-Be grateful you're free!
-You don't know me to talk like that!

1267
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:06,524
I know you. A kick in the keister
and your problems are solved.

1268
01:34:06,769 --> 01:34:10,125
Bigger problems, bigger kicks.
Who's next? The nation?

1269
01:34:10,369 --> 01:34:14,282
Don't blow your top.
I'm still ready to do business.

1270
01:34:14,489 --> 01:34:16,923
How's 1 00 grand?

1271
01:34:17,169 --> 01:34:20,127
A hundred grand is beautiful,
but I can't take it.

1272
01:34:20,369 --> 01:34:21,688
Why not?

1273
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:26,919
-My girl wouldn't like it, would she?
-No, she wouldn't.

1274
01:34:27,129 --> 01:34:28,767
Then what's your idea?

1275
01:34:29,089 --> 01:34:33,958
No idea. Legislation's
not meant for buying and selling.

1276
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:37,127
''This country belongs
to the people who inhibit it'' !

1277
01:34:37,449 --> 01:34:38,723
-Inhabit.
-Inhabit it!

1278
01:34:38,929 --> 01:34:40,726
-I'll do what I want.
-Try it.

1279
01:34:40,969 --> 01:34:42,118
-Who'll stop me?
-Us two.

1280
01:34:42,329 --> 01:34:44,126
Youse two? It'll be some day...

1281
01:34:44,369 --> 01:34:48,078
...when a hundred-a-week hick
and a dumb broad can stop me.

1282
01:34:49,169 --> 01:34:53,048
And you, standing around like
you're deaf! Say something!

1283
01:34:53,249 --> 01:34:55,319
-All right, I'll say something.
-Well?

1284
01:34:55,569 --> 01:34:56,718
They're right.

1285
01:34:56,929 --> 01:35:00,444
Whose side are you on?
What do you want?

1286
01:35:00,649 --> 01:35:02,321
-Rye ginger ale.
-Who asked you?

1287
01:35:02,529 --> 01:35:05,327
Tell that congressman he's
all washed up. I guarantee.

1288
01:35:05,529 --> 01:35:07,918
You won't
get away with it either.

1289
01:35:08,129 --> 01:35:11,883
-Don't worry about me.
-But I do. I worry like the devil.

1290
01:35:12,089 --> 01:35:16,287
When you live in Washington
it's enough to break your heart.

1291
01:35:16,489 --> 01:35:19,686
You see a piece of machinery,
the democratic structure...

1292
01:35:19,889 --> 01:35:22,847
...and somebody's always
tampering with it.

1293
01:35:23,049 --> 01:35:26,883
Steal from the government and
you steal from yourself, you dumb ox!

1294
01:35:27,089 --> 01:35:28,488
I'm going right ahead.

1295
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:31,123
-I'll tell you where you're going.
-You?

1296
01:35:31,329 --> 01:35:35,925
In this whole thing, I guess you
forgot about how I'm a partner.

1297
01:35:36,169 --> 01:35:39,923
Jim once told me.
1 26 different yards I own.

1298
01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:41,284
Control.

1299
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:44,527
Same thing. Here's how it is.
I don't want them.

1300
01:35:44,769 --> 01:35:47,727
I don't want what's yours,
so I'm signing them back.

1301
01:35:47,969 --> 01:35:50,722
-All right.
-Only not all at once. One at a time.

1302
01:35:50,969 --> 01:35:52,482
One a year.

1303
01:35:53,569 --> 01:35:55,446
Only you gotta behave!

1304
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:58,288
If you don't,
I could let go on everything.

1305
01:35:58,489 --> 01:36:01,128
For what you've done,
even since I've known you...

1306
01:36:01,369 --> 01:36:05,078
...I bet you could be put in jail
for about 900 years.

1307
01:36:05,489 --> 01:36:08,481
You'd be a pretty old man
when you got out.

1308
01:36:09,649 --> 01:36:11,128
What's going on around here?

1309
01:36:11,329 --> 01:36:12,444
A revolution.

1310
01:36:12,649 --> 01:36:15,288
Come on, Paul.
I'll send for my things.

1311
01:36:15,489 --> 01:36:19,084
You little crumb. You'll be
sorry for this. Wait and see.

1312
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:21,086
Go ahead.
You don't stand a chance.

1313
01:36:21,289 --> 01:36:23,245
You'll outsmart yourself.

1314
01:36:23,449 --> 01:36:24,928
-Goodbye, all.
-And you!

1315
01:36:25,169 --> 01:36:26,124
-Me?
-Yeah!

1316
01:36:26,369 --> 01:36:30,078
-You're fired.
-Sorry. I enjoyed working for you.

1317
01:36:31,849 --> 01:36:34,238
-Open up.
-All right, Harry?

1318
01:36:34,449 --> 01:36:36,917
Do what I'm telling you!

1319
01:36:48,649 --> 01:36:50,480
How do you like that?

1320
01:36:51,049 --> 01:36:53,882
He could've had 1 00 grand.
She could've had me.

1321
01:36:54,089 --> 01:36:55,920
Both wind up with nothing.

1322
01:36:56,169 --> 01:36:58,080
Dumb chump!

1323
01:36:58,289 --> 01:36:59,642
Crazy broad.

1324
01:36:59,849 --> 01:37:03,046
To all the dumb chumps
and all the crazy broads...

1325
01:37:03,249 --> 01:37:05,126
...past, present and future...

1326
01:37:05,329 --> 01:37:08,321
...who thirst for knowledge
and search for truth...

1327
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:12,642
...who fight for justice
and civilize each other...

1328
01:37:12,849 --> 01:37:16,478
...and make it so tough
for crooks like you.

1329
01:37:16,689 --> 01:37:18,088
And me.

1330
01:37:27,289 --> 01:37:28,927
License, please.

1331
01:37:33,089 --> 01:37:34,920
-No, not this license.
-Sorry.

1332
01:37:35,169 --> 01:37:36,682
Forget it.
My wedding present.

1333
01:37:36,889 --> 01:37:39,847
-Take it easy, or you'll never make it.
-We'll make it.

1334
01:37:40,049 --> 01:37:42,722
It's a clear case
of predestination.

1335
01:37:42,969 --> 01:37:44,038
''Pre'' what?

1336
01:37:44,249 --> 01:37:45,682
Look it up.

1337
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:02,798
