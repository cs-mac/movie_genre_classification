1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:50,549
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

2
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:45,062
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

3
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,232
So, what have we got?

4
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,777
Well, what we know is
it's a woman, americana.

5
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,237
Una gringa.

6
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,447
Sl, senor.

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,325
I caught her outside the church.

8
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,535
We have the weapon.

9
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,703
Oh, good.

10
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,081
We have a man in the hospital.

11
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,291
El pobre.
Poor guy.

12
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,127
And you have her back here?

13
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,419
Yeah.

14
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,880
Here she is.

15
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,932
Senora crawford.

16
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,774
The name is alston.
Martha alston.

17
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,869
Cigarette?

18
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,913
I don't smoke.

19
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,303
You wanna tell us about it?

20
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,518
Uh, miss alston,

21
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:11,690
How does a woman like you
wind up doing someth ing like th is?

22
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,737
I don't know.

23
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,657
All i know is i was
31 and still single.

24
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,118
Uh-Huh.
Go on.

25
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,538
And my sister was 25
and getting married.

26
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,707
Â™ª come with me â™ª

27
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,751
It was a beautiful wedding.
Really.

28
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,212
I was really happy for her,
and i was havin' a great time.

29
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,880
Â™ª to the sea â™ª

30
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,840
That is, until all
the pressure started.

31
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,970
Well, i guess it
won't be long

32
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,555
Before we're shopping
for baby clothes.

33
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,140
Mom, they just got married.

34
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,600
And you'll be next.

35
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,604
Gee, mom, did you just find out
you had a year to live or someth in'?

36
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,814
Come on, jan.
Give the kid a break.

37
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,399
She's got a lot
going on in her life.

38
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,859
She's bright, she's beautiful,

39
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,571
She's got a great job, and
we're very proud of her.

40
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,658
- Thanks, dad.
- Sure, honey.

41
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,369
So are you seeing anyone?

42
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,537
All right.

43
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,248
Cheers.

44
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,874
Cheers.

45
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,876
Look at ann ie.

46
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,172
The one on the end is kinda cute.

47
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,342
He looks like jerry.

48
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,346
The one that cried the first time
you made love.

49
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,765
That was great.

50
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,559
Then i found out he
cried every time.

51
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,895
You know, men should be
requ ired by law

52
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,314
To admit what's wrong with them
on the first date.

53
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,941
Yeah.

54
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,526
Don't worry, martha.

55
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,486
You'll be the next one.

56
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,113
Okay, aunt belinda.
Thank you.

57
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,781
Oh.

58
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,700
She's drunk.

59
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,536
That is my 37th
"don't-Worry-You'll-Be-Next" ton ight.

60
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,789
What is all th is about pressuring
single people to get married?

61
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,752
I was married, and believe me,
marriage is its own living hell.

62
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,547
Look at them.

63
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,174
They're so happy and in love.

64
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,135
Â™ª the sea of love â™ª

65
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,803
Â™ª i want to tell you â™ª

66
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,430
That is beautiful.

67
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,806
Yeah.

68
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,975
I give it a year.

69
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,476
Â™ª just how much i love you â™ª

70
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,936
Come on.

71
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,229
One day we'll have that.

72
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,605
You honestly believe that?

73
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,024
I do.
I really do.

74
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,442
On my good days.

75
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,860
Â™ª i want to tell you â™ª

76
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,236
And if it doesn't happen,
so what, you know?

77
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,030
I mean, i have a great life.
I'll be fine.

78
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,907
I'm gonna stop looking, 'cause
that's when it happens anyway,

79
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,409
When you're not looking.

80
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,660
Yeah.

81
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,162
We should just kick back
and let it happen,

82
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,330
If it's supposed to.

83
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,540
As a matter of fact, let's forget
the word "marriage" even exists.

84
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,083
Good idea.

85
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,294
At a wedding, forget
the word "marriage."

86
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,214
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

87
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,050
She's about to throw the bouquet!

88
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,135
Oh!

89
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,928
Hurry!
Qu ickly!

90
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,180
We gotta catch it!

91
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,807
Okay, so i didn't catch
the bouquet,

92
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,100
And i didn't really care.

93
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,144
I didn't, until it
was valentine's day,

94
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,481
The lamest day on
a single girl's calendar.

95
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,316
I worked on one of those
early-Morn ing shows.

96
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,443
You know, the whole point is,
they've had their caffeine

97
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,362
But ya haven't had yours.

98
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,405
Anyway, that was the day
that it happened.

99
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,076
That was the day i met h im.

100
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,535
I've said it before.
I'll say it again.

101
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,371
Regis and kath ie lee, look out.

102
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,331
E-Flat in ten seconds.

103
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,375
Okay.

104
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,002
We got six seconds left.

105
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,879
Yeah, you're a man who counts, marty.

106
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,383
H i, san diego!

107
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,468
Good morn ing, everyone.

108
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,220
We've got qu ite a love day
show for you.

109
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,888
One of your favorite
celebrity couples,

110
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,557
Mr. And mrs. Casey kasem
will be renewing their vows live...

111
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,975
Going good.

112
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,685
As always, dick's hair plugs
are mesmerizing.

113
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,229
Girl, leave h im alone.

114
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,230
Lunch?

115
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,481
Yeah.

116
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,400
Hey, missy, would you get sam tony
from perpetual artists

117
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,235
On the phone for me, please?

118
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,906
Just as soon as i put these
fabulous roses in some water.

119
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,075
They're from my fiance.

120
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,327
Do you want me to put some
in your office?

121
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,913
I'm sure my fiance wouldn't mind.

122
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,456
No, that's okay.

123
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,708
That's...you know, i'll just
call mr. Tony myself.

124
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,377
Super.

125
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,796
Yeah, that'll give you a chance
to put those fabulous flowers

126
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,132
In the vase, the ones
from your fiance.

127
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,342
Okay.

128
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,094
There's no need to yell.

129
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,223
- Okay.
- Okay.

130
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,559
Okay.

131
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,853
Okay.

132
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,189
Â™ª forever, my darling â™ª

133
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,941
Â™ª our love will be true â™ª

134
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,611
May i present mrs. Casey kasem.

135
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,905
Isn't she beautiful?

136
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,782
Â™ª my love with you â™ª

137
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,492
Yeah.

138
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,785
Okay.

139
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,454
Could you just leave a message
for mr. Tony, then?

140
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,831
It's about the mayberry,
r.F.D retrospective.

141
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,002
We have gomer, but
we still need goober.

142
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,796
Yeah. Okay.
Bye-Bye.

143
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,549
- Hey.

144
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,302
I got everyth ing from
the video library for th is, uh,

145
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,304
Tribute to famous
wh ite house pets.

146
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,808
There's some great footage of
h illary giving socks the cat a bath.

147
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,895
Oh, thanks, walter.
That'll be a big help.

148
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,022
And one more th ing.

For you.

00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,155
Aren't you sweet?

151
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,659
Where'd you get that,
missy's desk?

152
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,244
Happy valentine's day.

153
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,121
Oh, thanks.

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,581
You look great today.

00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,334
- You say that every day.
- Well, someone should.

156
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,793
Oh, you're sweet.

157
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,587
Sweet boy.

158
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,047
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.

159
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,716
Come on.

160
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,676
You know, there is a time
for a hug to end.

161
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,429
Ya hug and then ya break.

162
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,764
Come on, walter.
You do th is every week.

But i don't do th is.

164
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,183
Oh, don't get on your knees.

165
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,351
Please get up.
Up.

166
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,685

Just run with me
for a second here.

00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,355
Look, it's valentine's day.

169
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,689
Neither one of us has
a very special person

170
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,066
To spend valentine's day with.

171
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,400
I th ink that means someth ing.

172
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,902
Hmm. Right, i agree.

173
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,987
No, i th ink it means that
it's a coincidence,

174
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,531
And besides that,
i have a blind date.

175
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,115
Please get up, walter.

176
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,244
Martha. Guess what.

177
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,955
You're the most wonderful
woman that i've ever known.

178
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,708
Now that i have found you, i'm not
going to let you get away that easily.

179
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,210
I'd like you to know that.

180
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,796
I'd like you to know that people
are now pulling up chairs.

181
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,256
Okay.

182
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,091
Can you sit down, please?

183
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,551
Yeah, he's on h is knees.

184
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,010
Wait.

185
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,220
She's looking.

186
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,972
Thank you.

187
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,932
Walter, it would never work.

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,729
Let's just...
let's not complicate th ings.

189
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,899
Yes.

190
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,234

00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:36,700
- All right.

193
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,495
Hey, walter?

194
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,790
We're still on for that humiliating
defeat at air hockey tomorrow,

195
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,083
Aren't we?

196
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,585
Oh, yeah.

197
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,587
Yeah.

198
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,714
Oh, um, and i...
i, uh...

199
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,800
I reorgan ized your
whole rolodex th is morn ing.

200
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,553
My name falls under the w's.

201
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,890
You're the most excellent dude.

202
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:11,943
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

203
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,072
- I almost wore that.
- Really?

204
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,160
Nope.

205
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,038
My ph ilosophy is,

206
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,249
People are always gonna
need a place to live.

207
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,293
We just have to give
'em a reason to buy.

208
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,670
That's...that's very interesting.

209
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,881
I've always been able to sell.

210
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,883
Alw ays.

211
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,553
Why, i could even sell
an oven to an eskimo.

212
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,390
Do you mean a refrigerator?

213
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,268
Why would they need
a refrigerator?

214
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,486
It was wonderful
meeting you, martha.

215
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,197
Yeah, it was great.

216
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,700
Mmm, you smell so good,
so clean.

217
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,702
Oh, well, i showered yesterday.

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,079
Really?

219
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,914
Must be good, strong soap.

220
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,583
Uh, can i french-Kiss you?

221
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,215
N ight.

222

Â™ª well, there's many
ways a girl will run â™ª

Â™ª say, he don't need to be witty â™ª

230
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,408
Â™ª he don't need to be kind â™ª

231
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:46,162
Â™ª just gotta know those
places that are so hard to find â™ª

232
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,081
Â™ª and don't have to be pretty â™ª

233
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,501
Â™ª though sometimes that's good â™ª

234
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,420
Â™ª just gotta know where to go â™ª

Oh, my god!

244
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,544
No.

245
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,421

Did you just play th is song?

253
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,221
Â™ª i'm so lonesome i could cry â™ª

254
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:31,309
- Looks that way.

255
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,854
Â™ª i've never seen â™ª

256
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,689
Â™ª the n ight so long â™ª

257
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,108
Yeah. Really.

258
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:45,114
Â™ª and time is crawlin' by â™ª

259
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,162
Wow.

260
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,705
Â™ª the moon just waits... â™ª

261
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,332
"Wow"?

262
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,917
I was just gonna play th is song.

263
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,962
I dropped my quarter.
I was lookin' for my quarter.

264
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,590
I love th is song.

265
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,968
It's kinda funny.

266
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,803
Not the song.

267
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,513
The song isn't funny.

268
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,557
The song is sort of a bummer

269
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,518
In a cathartic, sexy,
romantic type of way,

270
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,187
If you know what i mean.

271
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,856
I don't believe i have a clue.

272
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,031
Are you lonesome?

273
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,583
Â™ª the silence of â™ª

274
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,543
No.

275
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,547
Â™ª a falling star â™ª

276
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:49,679
Â™ª lights up a purple sky â™ª

277
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,309
Â™ª and as i wonder â™ª

281
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,074
Â™ª and as i wonder â™ª

282

284
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,960
Â™ª i could cry â™ªâ™ª

285
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,636
Hey, why don't we go

00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,014
And moo goo gai pan?

00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,810
I don't even know you.

I mean, i never do
anyth ing like th is.

291
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,119
I'm...i'm kinda shy,
actually, so it's, um...

292
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,581
It's hard for me to feel at
ease with people right away.

293
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,170
Well, you're probably
not like those people.

294
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,925
You're different.

295
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,135
Isn't it strange?

296
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,974
I feel like i already know you,
and i don't even know what you do.

297
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,978
Oh, uh i'm an investor.

298
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,188
Like a banker?

299
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,442
Um, no, just
an independent investor.

300
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,239
I write a little also.

301
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,324
Do you?
What?

302
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,451
Poetry.

303
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,664
How wonderful.
Have you been published?

304
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,834
Well, yeah, uh...

305
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,420
I have a book.

306
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,005
Wow.

307
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,632
I'm sayin'

308
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,843
Yeah.
Well, uh,

309
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,346
I could show it to you
sometime, if you like.

310
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,017
I would love to see it sometime.

311
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,601
Great.

312
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,692
Oh. Hey.
Look at th is.

313
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,282
It's beautiful.

314
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,867
Yeah.

315
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,453
It is.

316
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,043
What?

317
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,088
I'm...i just...i can't
believe any of th is.

318
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,467
Uh...

319
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,053
Uh, sometimes you have to just
trust what you can't believe.

320
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,557
After all, life is a
synchron icity of chance.

321
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,986
Uh...

322
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,446
I, um...

323
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,573
I just wanna say, uh,
that i'm not...

324
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,910
I-I'm not looking to get
into anyth ing serious,

325
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,371
And i don't know if that's

I'm very busy, and, um...

329
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,923
What the hell am i saying?

330
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:22,058
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

331

Well, i don't know.

00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,080
It just made me th ink of th is.

336
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,582
You can tell me.

337
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:58,427
When i was a little girl...
i was about six years old...

338
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,973
I was at home and my
parents were downstairs and, uh,

339
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,433
I look in the window
and there's a clown.

340
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,231
- A clown?
- Yeah.

341
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,322
He was totally happy
and smiling and waving at me,

342
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:24,120
And i thought he was a special
friend that god had sent to me.

343
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,666
I found out later that
the people next door

344
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,418
Had h ired h im for
their son's birthday

345
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,920
And he got the wrong house.

346
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,803
I know it sounds stupid,
but it meant a lot to me.

347
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:53,024
It was just so...

348
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,651
So happy and unexpected.

349
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,033
And happy and unexpected
doesn't happen that often, ya know?

350
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,327
Uh-Huh.

351
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,663
Hey, i know.

352
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,416

bagels are good.

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,876

He's sensitive.
He's passionate.

380
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,971
He's funny.
He's incredibly sexy.

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,100

00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,239
That is so...all right.

390
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,367
Calm down. They're gonna hear.

391
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,704
Well, there's only

- Inga?

394
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,209
It didn't work out.

00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,502
How 'bout you?

396

I don't know.

399
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,054
I spent a lot of time
playing games

400
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:32,433
And dating other people
who played games.

401
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,188
Honesty is better, isn't it?

402
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,023
Yes.

403
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,026
When you're not serious,
you should say so.

404
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,156
Uh-Huh.

405
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:55,331
And when you are,
you should say so.

406
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,380
Yep.

407
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:10,012
Â™ª so now there's somebody new â™ª

409
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,106
Oh, let's do everyth ing together.

Oh, yeah.

411
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,446
Â™ª you say i'll be fine â™ª

412
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:31,742
Â™ª it only takes time â™ª

413
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,495
Â™ª somewhere â™ª

414
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,332
Â™ª that may be true â™ª

415
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:45,840

Â™ª ah, it's too soon â™ª

418
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,517
Would you like to hear some

419
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,185

I would love to.

421
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,482
It's a little late to be
modest, isn't it?

422
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,613
Well, people who live in
glass houses better wear shorts.

423
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,949
Isn't that a saying
or someth ing?

424
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:19,915
Â™ª too soon to tell â™ª

But every once in a wh ile, we

You know how you always

00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:48,780
In front of people you don't know

But is that good for you?

All men are horrible
in their own way.

654
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,095
You just have to learn
to accept that.

655
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,473
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

656

The french, you know?

716
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,365
I thought it had
someth ing to do with the frogs.

717
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,533
That's all right.

718
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,743

Â™ª love isn't always

Â™ª on time â™ª

Â™ª love isn't always on time â™ªâ™ª

No.

749
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,643
She's a killer.

750
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,727
Yeah.

751
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,979

You're an incredible person.

755
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,369
I mean, you're really
someth in' else, you know?

756
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,873
Um, and i've...i've really
mostly enjoyed

757
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,835
The time that we've
spent together.

758
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:31,047
But sometimes it's
about chemistry, you know?

759
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:35,760
And...and sometimes chemistry
works and sometimes it doesn't.

760
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:40,056
Sometimes you get a...
get an explosion

761
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:45,061
Or...or a really bad smell.

762
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,939
You know what i mean?

763
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,483
It's not good.

764
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,693
Okay.

765
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,152
You know how, um,
you feel about inga?

766
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,572
You know how, you know,
how she still loves you

767
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,365
But you don't love her?

768
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,368
How you used to love her but...
but you don't love her anymore?

769
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,997
How...how...okay, look.

770
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,248

00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,755
Okay?

774

Now, salt and pepper
goes together, right?

775
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,177
Sometimes, you know?

776
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,762
But some...it doesn't have to.

777
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,431
You don't have to have
pepper with salt.

778
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,017
Sometimes salt goes alone.

779
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:28,396
Sometimes salt goes
with other herbs, even.

780
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:34,235
And i'm...i'm saying that i
wanna see other herbs.

You know, i won't do

786
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,423
I'm not gonna walk out on you.

787
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,675
I won't desert you and the kids.

00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,524
See if there's anyth ing
in h is background

974
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,067
That you should be alarmed about.

975
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,819
Great.

976
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,655
Mm, uh, in the meantime...

977
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:25,159
In the meantime,
just live your life.

978
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,578
Try not to worry so much.

979
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,914
Thanks, mr. Tramonte.

980
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,059
So i'm really sorry th ings
didn't work out with wh itman.

981
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,728
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

982
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:57,524
Yeah. I'm really sorry about that.
Really sorry.

983
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,070
You sound so genu ine.
Thank you for your concern.

984
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,988
- That's what friends are for.
- Aren't they?

985
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,281
- Damn shame.
- Okay.

986
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,824
That's enough of that, okay?

987
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,621
You know, i checked out
th is opera we're about to see.

988
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,289
- Mm-Hmm?
- Mm-Hmm.

989
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:15,084
Turns out it's the touch ing
story of a young servant

990
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,462
Who goes through all these changes
over th is older, rich master guy's

991
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,547
Would-Be girlfriend,

992
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,092
But the young guy ends up with
her in the end, oddly enough.

993
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,468
Hmm.

994
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,095
So it turns out
that the whole th ing

995
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,972
Could've been avoided
if she just...

996
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,809
Not that th is resembles
your life in any way.

997
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:32,977
Sure.

998
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,353
Then we wouldn't be here,
would we?

999
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,729
There would be no opera,
so it's good that...

1000
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,523
Who wouldn't...shh.

1001
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,777
That's enough.
It's starting.

1002
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,071
You look terrific.

1003
00:54:45,156 --> 00:55:01,130
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

1004
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,590
Th is is even better than
that padres game we went to.

1005
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,175
Thanks for not bringing
that beach ball.

1006
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:08,012
That would've been
embarrassing.

1007
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,097
Excuse me.

1008
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,599
Oh, i saw a souven ir stand
up there.

1009
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,435
Thought maybe we could
get some t-Sh irts.

1010
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,602
You be all right here?

1011
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,397
Yeah. I'll be fine.
I'll see you in a minute.

1012
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,863
Martha. Hey. Hey.

1013
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:27,906
Excuse me.

1014
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,074
God, no.
Please.

1015
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,534
Please.
No.

1016
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,453
Martha, hey.

1017
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,288
H i.

1018
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:38,000
Martha?
Hey, martha.

1019
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,793
Oh-Ho.

1020
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,170
You won.
Okay.

1021
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,130
You wanted to make me
jealous, and you have, all right?

1022
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,715
So let's just go now, all right?

1023
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,842
Wh itman, no. No.
I wasn't kidding.

1024
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,594
I said i don't wanna
see you anymore.

1025
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,180
I don't wanna see you anymore.
Is that clear?

1026
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,681
Loud and clear.

1027
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,016
Okay, okay.

1028
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,309
You want me to listen to you more,

1029
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,561
To hear you more and stop
th inking only of myself.

1030
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,104
So come on.
Let's go.

1031
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,439
I'm not talking to you anymore, okay?

1032
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,690
Come...come here.

1033
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,150
Martha, don't walk away from me.

1034
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,152
Don't walk away, martha.

1035
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,820
Martha!

1036
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,074
Is th is gentleman bothering you?

1037
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:15,871
Excuse me?

1038
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,917
I'm her soul mate.

1039
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,211
I'm her lover.

1040
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,505
- Oh, my god.

1041
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,714
That one.

1042
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,841
Don't try to understand what your
mind is too small to contemplate,

1043
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,886
Okay, mr. Really n ice su it?

He gets a monthly check
from a trust fund,

1053
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,713
A very large trust fund...

1054
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:10,759
50,000-Bucks-A-Month large.

1055
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,219
Hmm.

1056
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:16,598
Uh, he lived with h is mother

Do someth ing.
I don't care what it is.

1070
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,716
You can just...
just name your price.

1071
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,594
Just do whatever it takes.

1072
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,722
No.

1073
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,933

What action?

1079
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:19,703
Bumped. Rubbed.
Smoked. Iced.

1080
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,331
- The big monkey.
- No!

1081
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,541

Uh, you know, that doesn't mean

Don't be n ice to her!

1293
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,943
Don't you be n ice to her, bob!

1294
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,030
- I'm sorry.
- Pull her hair!

1295
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,031
But...

1296
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,199
Just do it!

1297
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,325
Ow!

1298
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,452
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1299
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,585
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1300
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,253
Harder.

1301
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,672
Pull it harder!

1302
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,928
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

1303
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,221
What are you doing, bob?

1304
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,722
Hold her down, bob!

1305
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,515
Get her secure!

1306
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:33,686
Make those knots n ice and tight!

1307
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:40,610
What are you do...why are you
always putting sticky stuff on me?

1308
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,320
Give me the ants, bob.

1309
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,530
Ants? What ants?

1310
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:50,328
Prepare to be consumed,
martha alston.

1311
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,164
Prepare to be...

1312
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:01,381
Oh, god!
They're dead, bob.

1313
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:03,216
- They are?
- Yes, bob, they are.

1314
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:04,592
Didn't you feed them?

1315
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,469
I thought that you said
that you wanted them hungry.

1316
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:10,598
Hungry, bob!
Not dead!

1317
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,350
Now what are we gonna do?

1318
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,352
We could, uh...we could,
uh, reschedule.

1319
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,396
Like maybe next tuesday
is good for me.

1320
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:17,605
Hmm?

1321
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,233
Dream on, little beauty!

1322
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,902
Guess we'll just have
to cut her heart out.

1323
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,279
Are you okay with that?

1324
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,613
No, bob!

1325
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,448
I wanted her eaten by ants,

1326
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,660
But th is is obviously
the best we're gonna do!

1327
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:33,246
Hold her down, bob!

1328
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:36,082
Th ink about th is, 'cause,
you know, the ant idea was good.

1329
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,458
I kinda liked the ant idea.

1330
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:38,710
Okay, we could...

1331
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,712

1332
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,548

1333
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,593

1334
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:48,803

She's in the way, wh it!
Don't ya see that?

1336
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:57,729
No, inga, you're in the way.
Martha and i love each other.

1337
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,647
We don't. I don't.

1338
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:03,651
We are going to bu ild a life
unto each other.

1339
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:08,072
If you try to get between us,
i'll put you out the door.

1340
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:14,579
Now, for the last time,
put down the kn ife.

1341
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:23,713
Never! Never!
Never!

1342
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,768
God, you're bitch in', wh it.

1343
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:40,646
Ooh, save her!

1345
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,443
I can't let

1346
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,237
Don't make me shoot you, too, bob.

1347
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,907
Okay.

1348
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,534
Maybe i should call aaa.

1349
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,204

01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,857
No, no, no.

1360
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:27,735
Last time i let you out of my
sight, there was a su icide attempt.

1361
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,654
What was th is, some
kind of human sacrifice?

1362
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,364
You need taking care of, dear.

1363
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:34,117
Wh itman.

1364
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:43,543
- What is th is?
- Th is is an r.V., Honey.

1365
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,215
- Whose r.V.?

1366
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:52,260
I thought we could
use a family veh icle.

1367
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:57,390
- For what?
- For our little family.

1368
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,893
Say hello to mama, kids.

1369
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,979
Hola, mama.

1370

That's little n icole,

1371
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:08,734
Aren't they cute?

1372
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,319
They're consuela's kids.

1373
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,946
You remember.
Mom's housekeeper.

1374
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,408

Well, i know what you're th inkin'.

You're th inkin', "wh it,

1379
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,626
How come we aren't
having kids of our own?"

1380
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:29,046
Well, they're just to prime
the pump a little bit.

1381
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:33,718
We're gonna begin our own family
just as soon as we are married.

1382
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,761
- Sl.

1383
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,264
What?

1384
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,141
That's right.

1385
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:44,645
In six hours, you and i will
be wed in los cabos, mexico,

1386
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:50,026
At a beautiful little church
called saint margaret of the goats.

1387
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,694
See?

1388
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:55,031
No pesky blood tests
to slow us up there!

1389
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,824
Ah, let's get on the road.

1390
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,367
Here we go!

1391
01:14:58,535 --> 01:14:59,619
Okay, that's it.

1392
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:02,830
Ch ildren, come with, uh, me...

1393
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,374
Uh, poqu ito little ch ildren, um...

1394
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:08,211
Nos vamos a quedar aqu i.

1395
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,006
No, you don't understand.

1396
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,176
No, little mother.
You don't understand.

1397
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,475
Are you kidding?

1398
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:23,726
Little jokie?

1399
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,354
El joko?

1400
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,648
No more questions, little mother.

1401
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,399
All right, all right.
Come on.

1402
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:31,651
Let's break it up.

1403
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:33,528
Issues of control
happen when we're tired.

1404
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:38,282
Can't you see, kids, that your
mother is just all worn out?

1405
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,952
Don't be like that.

1406
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,833
I don't know what you
did to these kids,

1407
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:50,294
But i am gonna find a way out
and take 'em with me.

1408
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:51,546
I am.

1409
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,422
You're not gonna get away with th is.

1410
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:59,554
Honey, you don't understand.
Th is family is a legend in the making.

1411
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:00,805
Mm-Hmm.

1412
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,056
I mean, just look.

1413
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,934
It was an act of fate
that we even met.

1414
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,227
Kids?

1415
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,396
You wanna hear how
your mother and i met?

1416
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,898
Yes, dad.

1417
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,817
I was in a bar,

1418
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,945
And i played her favorite song.

1419
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,238
Hmm.

1420
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,406
By accident.

1421
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,910
Yeah, h it the wrong
button, but from that point on,

1422
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:26,914
We were on each other
like a couple of weasels.

1423
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:31,460
Moral of that story is,
accidents are the dirt

1424
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:33,796
That legends grow out of.

1425
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,927
Huh?

1426
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,262
Come on, honey.

1427
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,724
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

1428
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:48,102
You look lovely in the clothes
that i picked out for you.

1429
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,895
I feel funny.

1430
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:51,063
Do ya?

1431
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:54,650
Well, i took the liberty of
slipping a little relaxant

1432
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,611
Into your water.

1433
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,363
I thought you might be
a little tense.

1434
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,532
Now...oh, that's
noth ing scary, darling,

1435
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,660
Just a little mixture
that i came up with:

1436
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:09,999
A little, uh, chamomile
and some, uh, l.S.D.

1437
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,543
Okay, that would w...

1438
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:15,963
That would be why i'm
seeing worms on your face.

1439
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,137
Kids! We're gettin' close!

1440
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,764
All right, dad.

1441
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,098
Uh...

1442
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:31,687
So when i...when i was
drinkin' the...the...the...the...

1443
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:32,897
The tea?

1444
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,275
You're gettin' in touch
with your joy.

1445
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,658
Oh, you're gonna get
me started now.

1446
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,201
Yeah.

1447
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,621
Whoa!

1448
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:49,997
Whoa!

1449
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,672
God, it's good to have you back!

1450
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,006

Oh! Oh, no!

How do you know all th is?

1615
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:35,475

1616
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:37,602
Bob?

1617
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:56,997

The main roads, so you'd be
better off cuttin' cross-Country.

1621
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,506
I gotta get back to inga.

1622
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,176
She's been doin' tequ ila shots.

1623
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,095
Probably down to the worm by now.

1624
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:17,309
So long, kid.
Thanks, bob.

1625
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,019
Don't get me wrong.

1626
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:22,314
I love inga, but i couldn't
let you take the fall.

1627
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:28,445
Of course, th is doesn't mean i
won't help my baby hunt you down!

1628
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,198
Sure.

1629
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,159
Love's weird.

01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:36,870
I know.

1631
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,873
Vaya con dios, martha alston.

1632
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,333
Adios, bob.

1633
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,502
Gotta go,
gotta go.

1634
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:05,649
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

1635
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:09,152
Thanks for bein' there for me
when no one else was.

1636
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:15,784
Okay, martha, there's a time
for a hug to end, and th is is it.

1637
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,869
Come on.
We gotta get outta here.

1638
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:19,162
Come on.

1639
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,925
Sorry i could just get one horse.

1640
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,427
Aw.

1641
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:36,388
You know, they hang you for
stealin' horses around here.

1642
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:40,684
Are you limping?

1643
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:41,893
Oh, no.

1644
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:43,687
I just twisted my ankle in the church.

1645
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,105
Come on. Get on the horse.

1646
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,481
No, i'll walk.

1647
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:47,691
Yeah, i insist.
Come on.

1648
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:49,693
Get on the horse.

1649
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,453
Thank god.

1650
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:11,047
Wow, th is is romantic.

1651
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:15,719
Two people separated by chance finally
reun ited, going off into the sunset.

1652
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:20,140
It reminds me of an affair to remember
with cary grant and deborah kerr.

1653
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,226
Walter, she can't walk.
She gets run over.

1654
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:25,437
No, but i mean,
uh...all right.

1655
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:26,813
All right.

1656
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:28,064
What about casablanca?

1657
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:29,316
Humphrey bogart, ingrid bergman.

1658
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:30,484
Walter, she leaves h im.

1659
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:31,651
What about gone with the wind?

1660
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,069
He leaves her.

1661
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:34,070
Aah.

1662
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:35,280
What, uh...

1663
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,406
What movie ends with two people
ridin' off in the sunset?

1664
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:37,532
Don't worry about it.

1665
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,825
It doesn't matter, walter.
You know why?

1666
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:39,993
Why?

1667
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,161
Because the sun sets in the west,

1668
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:42,829
And we're supposed to be
heading north towards the border.

1669
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:46,166
Oh, yeah.

1670
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:48,543
Well, can't we just turn
right when the lights go out?

1671
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:51,713
- I mean, th is is kinda n ice.
- Yeah, it is n ice.

1672
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:55,800
Blinding, but it's n ice.

1673
01:31:56,844 --> 01:32:42,222
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

1701
01:34:43,886 --> 01:34:48,014
Â™ª too many broken hearts
have fallen in the river â™ª

1702
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:52,352
Â™ª too many lonely souls
have drifted out to sea â™ª

1703
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,271
Â™ª you lay your bets and
then you pay the price â™ª

1704
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:01,194
Â™ª the th ings we do for love â™ª

1705
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:05,615
Â™ª commun ication is the problem
to be answered â™ª

1706
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:10,036
Â™ª you've got a number and
your hand is on the phone â™ª

1707
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:13,248
Â™ª the weather's turned and
all the lines are down â™ª

1708
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:17,544
Â™ª the th ings we do for love â™ª

1709
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,588
Â™ª like walkin' in the rain
and the snow â™ª

1710
01:35:20,756 --> 01:35:22,799
Â™ª and there's nowhere to go â™ª

1711
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:27,220
Â™ª and you're feelin' like
a part of you is dyin' â™ª

1712
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:31,725
Â™ª and you're lookin' for

1713
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:33,893
Â™ª you th ink you're gonna break up â™ª

1714
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:37,480
Â™ª then he says he wants to make up â™ª

1715
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:41,651
Â™ª ooh, you had me crawlin' â™ª

1716
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:45,697
Â™ª on the floor â™ª

1717
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:51,244
Â™ª a compromise would
surely help the situation â™ª

1718
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:55,540
Â™ª agree to disagree
we've disagreed before â™ª

1719
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:58,418
Â™ª well, after all it's
just a compromise â™ª

1720
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,587
Â™ª of the th ings we do for love â™ª
