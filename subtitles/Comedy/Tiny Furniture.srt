
1
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,317
Honey, I'm home.

2
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,662
Family?

3
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,081
We're downstairs.

4
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,006
Can you move your right toe,
like, slightly towards me?

5
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,883
- Just a little bit more.
- It hurts.

6
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,843
- Perfect.
- Hi.

7
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,470
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

8
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,057
Look, my feet really, really hurt.
You know I'm not good on high heels.

9
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,976
We'll be done
in one minute. Just one more roll.

10
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,479
How come you never use me
in any pictures?

11
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,233
- You're never here.
- Plus, my legs are longer and more supple.

12
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,735
Come say hi, sweetie.

13
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,363
Come give me a kiss.

14
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,199
- Hi.
- We'll be done really soon.

15
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,619
How about if we order dinner,
and I let you choose what you want?

16
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,996
How long are you gonna be
staying in our house?

17
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,833
Last I checked, it's my house too.
I have a whole bedroom.

18
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,710
You used to have a whole bedroom.
It's my special space now.

19
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,922
Candice, can you...

20
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,551
come and move
the couch on the left...

21
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,930
like, oh, one inch
towards the window?

22
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,849
- Hey, Candice.
- Hey, Aura.

23
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,809
Some boxes came for you,
so I put them in your bedroom.

24
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,020
- Not your bedroom.
- Thank you. I think you're being mean.

25
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,898
I think you're being oversensitive.

26
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,276
I just got off a plane from Ohio.
I'm in a postgraduate delirium.

27
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,194
I think you sound like you're
in the epilogue to Felicity.

28
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,488
The guy I thought I was gonna marry
just moved to Colorado.

29
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,324
- Cut me some slack.
- You were not gonna marry him.

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,744
He's like a little speck of granola
on a bowl of homemade yogurt.

31
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,291
You know, I always said
he was really a sweet guy...

32
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,293
and like, the perfect
first boyfriend, like...

33
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,628
the way a college boyfriend should be.

34
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,007
So basically you're saying I wasted
two years of my life on a speck of granola?

35
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,010
No. Regret is a complete
waste of time.

36
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,930
I never think about my 20s,
and I absolutely don't look back.

37
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,185
Could you turn on your lamp?
I don't like overhead light.

38
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,814
The bulb is blown.

39
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,816
Replace it.

40
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,611
I don't know where they are.

41
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,946
Lazy.

42
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,990
You're gonna call me lazy?

43
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,160
You're the one who does everything
with, like, Gumby arms.

44
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,245
What are you talking about?

45
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,582
Maybe the fact that every time
I ask you to help me with anything...

46
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,834
you do it with, like,
limp, rubbery arms...

47
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,253
that make me wish
I had just handled it myself.

48
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,590
Do you really want to start this right now?
Do you want to start this?

49
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,008
Start what?

50
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,177
I have, like, a million things
I could say right now.

51
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:25,640
- Like what?
- Like, "Get a fucking lightbulb."

52
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,519
- Oh, it's ridiculous. It's a museum.
- Mom?

53
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,065
It's all forms and registrars.
I need to figure out how to be a diva.

54
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,359
- Siri?
- Hold on a second.

55
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,028
- What? I'm on the phone.
- I need a lightbulb.

56
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,238
In the white cabinet.

57
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,492
All right. Sorry.

58
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,245
What's a harridan, anyway?

59
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,208
Yeah, exactly.

60
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,836
Yeah, that's what
I have to learn to be.

61
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,342
Yeah, he tries to take out
three-quarters of my work...

62
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,552
48 hours before the show opens.

63
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,933
Yeah. You're gonna help me
figure this out. Exactly.

64
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,813
"June 28, 1974.

65
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,856
Enough bullshit about chronology.

66
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,776
It doesn't really matter lately
what I do and who calls me when.

67
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,238
It matters more what I'm thinking,
which is that I haven't been making art...

68
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,573
yet I have a fierce desire
to be an artist.

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,786
Having a body of my own work seems
more like security to me than anything.

70
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,163
Setting up a studio,
having shows, seems like...

71
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,001
one of the few worthwhile things
there is for me to do.

72
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,462
Today I ate zucchini bread,
cheese crackers, wine."

73
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,761
Mornin'.

74
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,681
- It's wakey-uppy time.
- Mom, why?

75
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,683
Well, I just think
if you're home with us...

76
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,768
it would be good if you were
a little bit on our schedule.

77
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,938
Ma, I just graduated.
I just want to sleep a little bit.

78
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,733
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

79
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,486
Wow. It smells a little stale in here.
Did you perspire in the night?

80
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,488
Oh, my God.
Please get out of my room.

81
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,783
I'm thinking maybe we need to wash
the sheets, or perhaps we need a shower?

82
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,785
- Oh, please get out.
- Upsy-daisy.

83
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,621
- Please get out of my room. Please!
- I'm outta here.

84
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,707
Oh, my God.

85
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,963
Fuck.

86
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,845
Hi.

87
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,307
- I'm awake now.
- Great.

88
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,642
Did you see that e-mail
about loan forms?

89
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,062
'Cause that's not supposed to go here.
It's supposed to go to the gallery.

90
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,481
- Yeah, I saw that. I'll e-mail them.
- Thank you.

91
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,566
Am I not allowed to come
down here in my pajamas?

92
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,485
I don't care.

93
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,945
Candice, I really appreciate
you letting me keep Gilda down here.

94
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,114
The cats are being
very lusty towards her.

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,534
- No problem. She's really cute.
- What are you doing today, love?

96
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,745
I think I'm gonna go to a party tonight.

97
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,290
And I hate to be vulgar,
but I have to ask you for some money.

98
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,835
Upstairs in the white cabinet
you can find my purse.

99
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,680
- Hi, hi, hi.
- Hello!

100
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,974
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?

101
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,103
I'm doin'.
I'm in the library.

102
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,022
All the freshmen arrived today,
and I cruised them so hard.

103
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,525
I watched them all
moving into their dorms...

104
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,361
all the minifridges
and collapsible hampers...

105
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,030
and posters
of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss.

106
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,575
- Are you done with your research?
- As done as I'm gonna be.

107
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,703
You know, it's-it's hard
to completely close the door...

108
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,831
on "modes of Western femininity"...

109
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,667
but my grant is up
and my housing ends next week.

110
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,503
I'm jealous. I've been home
for a day, and I miss it already.

111
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,005
I don't know. I think this summer
was the dreamiest one of my life.

112
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,133
Are you kidding?

113
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,845
You were miserable. You spent
half your time with me in the library.

114
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,557
Oh, and stopped eating gluten
and kept threatening to decamp for India.

115
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,101
That's totally right.
But oh, my God.

116
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,562
I found my mom's journals
from when she was our age.

117
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,022
They're unbelievable.
I'm reading them illegally.

118
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,776
And she also had a hippie boyfriend
who had to go find his destiny. Listen to this.

119
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,364
"Making love with Eric tends
to be more fun than passionate.

120
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,492
No, that's an absurd generalization.
It's different every time."

121
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,578
This part's a little gross.
I don't even want to read this.

122
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,580
"But I'm getting on the bus
to go to New York.

123
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,749
I cried in bed last night so much
because I was so confused...

124
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,627
and because I love Eric so much
and I'm afraid of losing him...

125
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,422
but he needs to be on the farm."

126
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,091
Owen needs to be on the farm.

127
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,302
The funny farm.

128
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,762
Aren't you a little glad
that he's not moving with you?

129
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,348
I don't know. I miss him.

130
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,185
Oh, but Frankie, I miss you more.
Get here already.

131
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,270
I'll be there soon, okay?

132
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,439
- I love you.
- I love you too.

133
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,070
Shalom. Hubba hubba.

134
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,614
- Hi.
- Hi.

135
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,782
- Really good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

136
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,327
- You look so pretty.
- Oh, are you serious?

137
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,330
I feel this outfit just screams, like,
"I've been living in Ohio for four years.

138
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,041
Take me back to your gross apartment
and have sex with me."

139
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,044
No, you look great.
You look so special.

140
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,881
And I saw that your dyslexic
stripper video got, like, 400 hits.

141
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,966
That's embarrassing.
That one's not even that good.

142
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,803
- No. You know everyone, right? Come on in.
- I don't know.

143
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,974
You can just put your bag in here.

144
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,937
Come here.

145
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,231
So I want to introduce you
to this boy Jed.

146
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,399
He's so witty and so special,
just like you.

147
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,318
You guys are gonna
get along really great.

148
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,738
He can be kind of grumpy sometimes,
but kind of in a cool way.

149
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,740
He has this show on YouTube
where he rides...

150
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,451
this rocking horse
and talks to fake enemies.

151
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,453
Oh, my God.
I think I know who that is.

152
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,664
- It's the Nietschian Cowboy, right?
- Yeah.

153
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,708
Yeah, yeah. He's the same guy who does
the Skeptical Gynecologist videos.

154
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,710
- Yeah, you've seen those?
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,129
- Yeah. You think they're funny?
- I do think they're funny.

156
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,590
- He's a little bit famous.
- Yeah, I guess so...

157
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,759
in, like, an Internet kind of way.

158
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,178
But we met at this comedy show.

159
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,306
It was really lame,
and he really liked my monologue.

160
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,308
Oh, my God.

161
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,769
Are you so sad
about your boyfriend?

162
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,939
I am really sad.
It's been a really hard few weeks.

163
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,941
I always knew he was
gonna have to take this journey...

164
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,902
but I just didn't expect
it was gonna be so soon.

165
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,196
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- And then, like -

166
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,117
Okay.

167
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,086
Hi.

168
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,006
Jed, this is my so-special friend, Aura.

169
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,049
Hello, so-special friend Aura.

170
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,676
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

171
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,594
I'm actually a big fan
of your work on the YouTube.

172
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,014
Aw shucks.

173
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,016
I, um, actually thought
you lived in Chicago -

174
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,518
maybe because your MySpace profile
says you live in Chicago.

175
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,062
I do live in Chicago.
I'm here on business.

176
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,732
- Oh, cool. What kind of business?
- Top-secret business.

177
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,234
- Government stuff.
- Hmm.

178
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,738
- Aura does really cool videos too.
- Oh, cool.

179
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,198
I thought you told me there was
gonna be some grinding at this party -

180
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,076
like, straight-up,
eighth-grade-style grinding.

181
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,912
Oh, no.
I meant eighth-grade-style crying.

182
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,165
- Oh, "crying."
- We're all gonna cry together.

183
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,834
- I see. My mistake.
- So how long are you in town for?

184
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,337
- Uh, I'm in town for roughly -
- Oh, my God.

185
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,630
Oh, my fucking God.

186
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,632
Charlotte.
Oh, my God. Charlotte.

187
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,426
Oh, my God!

188
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,679
I'm so sorry I slapped you.
I'm just so overwhelmed.

189
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,681
Aura! Aura!

190
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,933
- Are you here? Are you here?
- I'm here.

191
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,102
I know Ashlynn, so, yeah, I'm here.

192
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,148
This girl has been
my best friend since I'm one.

193
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,651
- Since I'm... less. Zero.
- It's true.

194
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,446
Our moms used to rub their stomachs
together when they were pregnant with us.

195
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,698
They were the best friends ever...

196
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,410
until my mom
got into Landmark Forum...

197
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,373
and Tony Robbins and ran off to Wyoming
and opened a really dumb...

198
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,333
bed-and-breakfast.

199
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,669
And it's certainly sad.
Now they only speak once a year.

200
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,756
So, how's college in Ontario?

201
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,342
Ohio. I was in college in Ohio.

202
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,302
That's really great.

203
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,596
But, um, you have to come with me.

204
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,058
You have to come with me now.
And we have to talk.

205
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,316
I am so sorry.
I, like, hardly know her.

206
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,318
I met her at this weird
fashion party last week.

207
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,529
She's totally crazy,
but in a really fun way.

208
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,656
- Is her accent real?
- Yeah, I think so.

209
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,908
Her dad's British.
She went to fifth grade there.

210
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,494
Oh.
Well, you should totally stay.

211
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,538
Yeah, I don't know.
I feel like I should go with her.

212
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,540
I've been avoiding her
for, like, five years.

213
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,042
Yeah, I can see why. Yeah.

214
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,044
Anyway, thank you
so much for having me.

215
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,755
Oh, no problem.
You should say good-bye to Jed, though.

216
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,508
- Okay.
- Yeah. I think he really likes you.

217
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,510
Okay.

218
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,015
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it goin'?

219
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,309
It's okay. I'm takin' off.

220
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,186
- Takin' off already?
- Yeah, you saw my friend.

221
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,981
- She really wants me to leave with her.
- Okay.

222
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,899
How much longer are you in town?

223
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,944
I'm in New York
for another almost two weeks.

224
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,029
Well, I'm sure you're very busy...

225
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,700
but if you need a native to show
you around, I'd be glad to do it.

226
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,910
You should give me your number.

227
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,620
Okay.

228
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,042
Taxi!

229
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,468
I leave my lights on when I'm gone.

230
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,428
For fun.

231
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,389
- And you live here alone?
- I do.

232
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,559
And you live with Siri.
How is she?

233
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:34,188
She's good, I think. She's working a lot.
Big retrospective next year.

234
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,733
She's not really dating or anything,
but I think she's happy.

235
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,068
- And then there's Nadine.
- Oh, who I saw.

236
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:43,572
On the street.
And who is so tall.

237
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,532
You're lucky to have them -

238
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,869
Siri and Nadine.

239
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,996
I feel like a fucking orphan.

240
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,501
I'm gonna smoke.
I'm gonna smoke pot.

241
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,961
- Do you smoke?
- I could.

242
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,428
Okay, full disclosure:

243
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,723
I was in a rehab in 2007.

244
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,684
But it wasn't for this.
It was for, like...

245
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,104
a blow situation
that I since cleared up.

246
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,066
- Do you drink?
- Yeah. No.

247
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,817
No, I, um -

248
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,321
Only kombucha, you know?
And some red wine.

249
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,949
But that's good for you.

250
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,576
But I don't think we need to talk
about all our issues, you know?

251
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,955
Can't we just start again
as new friends, you know?

252
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,750
Who... Who were old friends,
you know?

253
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,642
Yeah, like new friends who
share a lot of old memories.

254
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:40,087
Exactly.

255
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,302
Exactly.

256
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,930
It's kind of like that book
The Giver, you know...

257
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,932
where the, um...

258
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,685
that kid stores everyone's emotions,
that guy?

259
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,272
No, it's not like that at all.

260
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,149
Here.

261
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,151
Thank you.

262
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,737
Well, I want to know about you.
What do you do?

263
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,198
What do you love to do?

264
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,409
Uh... well, I studied film theory...

265
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,411
which I guess I liked.

266
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,372
And then this past summer
I was an assistant...

267
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,542
to a documentary film professor,
like, doing research and stuff.

268
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,169
Sounds like fun.

269
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,214
It wasn't really that fun.

270
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,345
Ooh!

271
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,988
- This is so funny.
- You think so?

272
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,033
I think it's so stupid.
It's just, like, me in a bikini...

273
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,493
in a campus fountain
while my ex-boyfriend watches.

274
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,080
I fucking love it.
Look how many views it's got.

275
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,082
It's got all these comments as well.

276
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,710
"Ahoy, mateys. Whales ahead."

277
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,670
"What a blubber factory."

278
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,715
"Put on some pants
or a burlap sack."

279
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,258
Oh.

280
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,303
"No, her stomach isn't huge.
It's just that her boobs are really small.

281
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,930
It's an optical illusion."

282
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,975
Oh, you can't possibly
take these seriously, Aura.

283
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,144
I do sometimes.

284
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,688
I kind of want to take this
off-line anyway.

285
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,316
I think you're a genius.

286
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,401
You should be on Saturday Night Live.

287
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,403
Or maybe something
more early Yoko Ono...

288
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,907
where you're just moving through a gallery
and everyone's watching you.

289
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,743
No way.
The art world's my mom's racket.

290
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,787
I don't know what I'll be.

291
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,039
Is Siri making you get a job?

292
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,833
She's not making me.
I mean, I probably should.

293
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,379
My psycho-pharm says
there's no such thing as "should."

294
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,174
Plus, no one's even financially
independent until they're at least 25.

295
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,259
Or even 30.

296
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,345
What do you think you'll do?

297
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,389
I have no idea what I'm qualified for.

298
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,266
I worked at this place
around the corner called Clandestino.

299
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,103
It's, like, sort of
a dinner bistro kind of thing.

300
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,480
- You were a waitress or -
- No, I was a hostess.

301
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,565
It's the easiest job ever.

302
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,611
You just have to look nice and greet people,
and then old guys send you drinks.

303
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,781
You're so charming. You could do it.
And I know they're hiring.

304
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,575
Just go round there tomorrow
and say you know me.

305
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,412
- I have no experience.
- It's absolutely fine.

306
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,289
On my resume, under "skills"
I put "Has a land line."

307
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,291
That's amazing.
Thank you.

308
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,253
I mean, being my guardian angel.

309
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,797
Oh, sleep over, please.

310
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,884
I can't. I live so close by.
I just gotta go home.

311
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,970
Really good to see you, though.

312
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,640
You have to promise to call me.

313
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,767
I'll call you this week.

314
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,814
- Good night.
- Oh, Aura, don't go!

315
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,899
Please don't go!

316
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,785
- What are you doing Saturday?
- A practice test.

317
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,289
I never took one of those,
and I came out with a cool score of 1,000.

318
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,666
Listen, not to be rude,
but your bath products...

319
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,252
are sort of scattered
all over the bathroom...

320
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,546
so if you could maybe
keep them on one shelf?

321
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,257
And there's also some hair in the sink
that's definitely not mine.

322
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,843
So if you could do something with that,
and scoop the kitty litter...

323
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,887
that'd be really great.

324
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,437
Deep scoops.

325
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,532
Hello, sir.

326
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,785
Can I seat you for dinner?

327
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,997
You know, it's just
answering the phone, taking deliveries...

328
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,999
you know,
writing down reservations.

329
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,878
You'd be up here a lot by yourself.
The boys will be down in the kitchen.

330
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,255
Um, the wait staff gets in
at around 5:30...

331
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,424
so it's not the most social job.

332
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,594
I'm a video maker,
so my schedule is very flexible.

333
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,014
- I make my own schedule.
- Okay, so when can you start?

334
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,017
Uh, tomorrow. Now.

335
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,019
Let me go downstairs and check.

336
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,271
I think we could start you,
like, next Friday?

337
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,690
I really appreciate it.
I haven't done this before...

338
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,235
but I'm a very fast learner
and I'm very enthusiastic.

339
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,946
Well, no need to be that enthusiastic.

340
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,615
I mean, do you want to know
what it pays?

341
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,285
- I'm sorry. I forgot to ask.
- Yeah, it's $11 an hour to start...

342
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:27,290
and you can't expect tips because,
you know, you're a day hostess, so -

343
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,043
- I was not expecting any tips.
- Okay, good.

344
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,087
Well, so I'll be right back.

345
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,563
- Hi.
- Hey.

346
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,232
I'm the new hostess - day hostess.

347
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,234
And just so you know,
I'm not working right now...

348
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,237
and I wasn't sleeping,
if you saw me before.

349
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,866
Probably a great thing to do
is to just be hired...

350
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,993
and then rest your head
on the counter.

351
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,872
Yeah, probably not the best way
to make a first impression.

352
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,624
- Do you work here?
- I do.

353
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,294
- Are you a waiter?
- I'm a chef.

354
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,796
Oh, like, the chef?

355
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,882
I'm a chef.

356
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,522
- Look who I found!
- Oh, my God. Hi.

357
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,649
I got the job.
Thank you so much.

358
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,651
Oh, no problem.
Julia's nice, right?

359
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,987
Yeah, she's really nice, although
I made a complete fool of myself...

360
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,989
in front of a really hot guy.

361
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,824
Not one of the Mexicans?

362
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,243
No, like, blond and kind of
American Psycho-y looking.

363
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,454
Oh yeah, Keith.
He is hot, right?

364
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,540
He's the sous chef,
although it's a shame about that fedora.

365
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,834
- And he's got a really filthy mouth.
- Really?

366
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,503
Yeah. One time, though, I saw him
sitting on a crate of onions...

367
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,672
reading Austerlitz,
so he's weirdly literary.

368
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh, whoa.

369
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,843
Hey, do you want to go to the Odeon
and order everything on the menu?

370
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,180
I would love to.
It sounds so tempting, but I can't.

371
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:09,184
If it's a money thing, I have my dad's
credit card, and I've been using it all week.

372
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,186
I mean, he told me
I have baggy under-eyes.

373
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,688
You have beautiful under-eyes,
but I can't.

374
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,524
God, in high school you were always
the "I have to go home" girl.

375
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,610
Are you still
the "I have to go home" girl?

376
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,446
I'm trying not to be,
but I have to go home, okay?

377
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,531
I'll see you soon.

378
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,162
Now you need to take grape...

379
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,916
and mix it with peanut butter,
and then it's like you're eating a PB and J.

380
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,377
- Good idea.
- Actually, there's no peanut butter here.

381
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,420
- That one?
- No, no, that's not peanut butter.

382
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,839
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

383
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,883
- Mm.
- Try that one.

384
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,427
- It's peach. It's peach.
- Maybe they don't have it.

385
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,389
That's so weird. I always think
of it as, like, a classic flavor.

386
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:52,060
It's classic, but not in this box.

387
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,062
Uh, hmm.

388
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,897
- Hi.
- Hey.

389
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,817
- Hi. What's up?
- Guess who got a job?

390
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,819
- Who?
- Me.

391
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,989
I'm a hostess at Clandestino,
right around the corner.

392
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,200
What does that entail, though?

393
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,954
I don't know. Like, answering
the phone, taking reservations.

394
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,039
You're great on the phone.

395
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,377
- What are you up to?
- Tell her, Deeny.

396
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,255
What -
You can - you can do it.

397
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,676
Nadine got the biggest prize
you could get in the United States.

398
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,095
- Tell her.
- No -

399
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,598
It's for poetry,
and it's not the entire United States.

400
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,768
The biggest high school award...

401
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,229
in poetry in the United States.

402
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,273
Whoa. Amazing.

403
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,567
I didn't even know you wrote poetry.

404
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,903
No, I don't, I don't.
Poetry's a very stupid thing to be good at.

405
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,614
I mean, poems
are basically like dreams -

406
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,034
something that everybody
likes to tell other people...

407
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,037
but nobody actually cares about
when it's not their own.

408
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,415
Which is why poetry's a failure
of an intellectual community.

409
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,876
You have to hear this poem.

410
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,920
It's complicated, subtle...

411
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,257
very un-high school.

412
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,968
"I know that you like to look at me...

413
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,596
since sometimes,
in the middle of the night...

414
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,639
I see you watching me.

415
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,434
Well, I don't see you...

416
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,145
but I see your shadow
moving back and forth...

417
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,814
in the square of yellow light
that is your window...

418
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,400
not like you're going somewhere...

419
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,611
but like you're moving to move."

420
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,619
That's really beautiful.

421
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,579
Whenever I write a poem, I feel like...

422
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,957
someone with all these, like, feelings.

423
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,085
It's not too poem-y, which I like.

424
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,337
I feel like every time
I wrote a poem in college...

425
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,506
it was completely about virginity loss.

426
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,342
And I would also read it
in this horrible voice, like...

427
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,261
"This is my slam poetry voice."

428
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,894
- But you liked it?
- Yeah, I love your poem.

429
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,897
And I feel like you're now a complete
shoe-in for every university.

430
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,192
You do everything.
You just won this massive prize.

431
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,905
I don't know. You're totally willing
to give admission officers BJs. There's that.

432
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,033
Ew. That's disgusting.

433
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,536
Can I ask you something?

434
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,830
I want to say yes...

435
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,707
but usually when you ask me
if you could ask me something...

436
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,837
it's not something
I want to be asked, so -

437
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,548
Have you lost your virginity yet?

438
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,926
I think you would probably know
the answer to that question.

439
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,970
Is that really something
you need to ask me?

440
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,222
I don't know if I would know
the answer to that question.

441
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,724
- You don't tell me everything.
- I think you would know.

442
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,894
I don't know.
Have you ever had an orgasm?

443
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,773
I'm not answering a question
like that! That's -

444
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,775
If you keep asking me
things like that...

445
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,611
I'm just gonna leave this bathroom
and leave you to your shaving.

446
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,947
There is no reason for you
to shriek at me right now.

447
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,825
Yeah, there is, because I'm not
so over-share-y like you.

448
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:57,453
Like, I'm not just gonna go down
into Mom's studio and be like...

449
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,416
"Mom, Candice, like,
my heart is so broken...

450
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,878
and my vagina hurts so much!"

451
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,092
Whatcha doin' in my closet, kiddo?

452
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,178
Uh...

453
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,388
I'm looking for new shoes.

454
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,807
I hate all my shoes.

455
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,351
And I think I'm going
on a date tomorrow.

456
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,103
With whom?

457
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,440
This guy Jed.
He makes comedy videos.

458
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,525
Is he nice?

459
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,944
I'm not sure yet.

460
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,364
But we are going
to a French movie.

461
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,200
Mm.

462
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:38,786
Can I show you a video of him
and see if you think it's funny?

463
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,290
Please give this to me.

464
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,542
Did you Google "cupcakes"?

465
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,219
I reject your Platonicism.

466
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:58,014
More than that, I reject
your whole way of life, partner.

467
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,644
This town ain't big enough
for Christianity and egalitarianism.

468
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,855
Insanity in individuals is quite rare...

469
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:11,110
but in groups, parties, nations,
and epochs, it is a rule.

470
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,405
I'm crazier than an epoch,
and I'm riding my horse right at ya.

471
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,536
See, it's highbrow,
but it's very witty, I think.

472
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,331
It's witty, but it's kinda goofy.

473
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:30,463
It's not very mature, but every time I come
into your room, I want to sleep in your bed.

474
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,884
Well, you can sleep here if I'm here.
You just can't sleep here if I'm not here.

475
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,805
So when you and Nadine are visiting colleges
next week, I can't sleep in here?

476
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,599
- That is correct.
- What's the difference?

477
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,270
You need to be invited.
I have to invite you to come in.

478
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:48,648
Like a vampire?

479
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,043
Coming.

480
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,880
- Aura?
- Oh, hey, Noelle.

481
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,216
Oh, I had no idea
that you were home.

482
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,593
Are you on some kind of a break?
Fall break?

483
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,054
- I graduated.
- Oh, Jesus. Already?

484
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,516
And what about
your boyfriend, um, Noah?

485
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,185
Owen. We broke up.

486
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,271
Oh, no!

487
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,690
He was so sweet.
Do you remember, Jacob?

488
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,693
You liked him so much at that party,
at the New Year's party.

489
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,778
Yeah, he moved back to Colorado.

490
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,239
Uh, something
about having to build a shrine...

491
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,658
to his ancestors out of a dying tree.

492
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,411
- Are you looking for my mom?
- No. Actually, I'm looking for Nadine.

493
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,122
Sometimes she watches Jacob,
you know, in a pinch.

494
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,666
Sorry. We love Nadine, right?

495
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,753
Yes? Is Nadine around?

496
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,547
She's out somewhere.

497
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,300
But, um, I could watch Jacob
if you needed.

498
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,052
I'm sure you're busy.

499
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,554
- I have a little time.
- That would be great.

500
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,267
Just...
Maybe just put on some pants.

501
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,186
Okay.

502
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,819
Do you need my help?

503
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,905
Uh, nope.

504
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,077
Do you want to see my hamster?

505
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,663
Uh...

506
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,791
definitely N-O.

507
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,548
What do you think
I should wear on my date tonight?

508
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,884
A tube top.

509
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,057
- Oh, hey. What's up?
- How's it goin'?

510
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,934
- It's good. How are you?
- I'm doin' all right.

511
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,894
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, don't worry about it.

512
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,563
I'm staying on my friend's couch,
and right when I was getting ready to leave...

513
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,441
he and his girlfriend
got into this huge, fuckin'...

514
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,195
heroic, epic argument
right at the front door.

515
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,824
- Oh, no.
- I was locked in by a wall of aggression.

516
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,326
- That sounds really stressful.
- Yeah, it was really stressful.

517
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,830
It was. I went to an ATM
around the corner just now...

518
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,915
- and the machine told me to go fuck myself.
- Oh.

519
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,917
- Yeah.
- In those words?

520
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,086
In those exact words, saying,
"I have not a penny for you."

521
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,755
I'm in deep financial constraints.

522
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,299
So, what do you -
you want to go -

523
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,928
I was thinking, you know,
I'm already late, I'm already broke -

524
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,013
So maybe we should just
skip the movie?

525
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,725
Which is actually fine, because
my horrible secret is that I hate foreign films.

526
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,646
Interesting. I think a lot of people
nurture that horrible secret.

527
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,149
Well, let's see.
Are you hungry?

528
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,402
Thirsty?

529
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,612
Were you here when
I was talking about how broke I was?

530
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,656
Were you around for that section?

531
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,826
So what do people with no money do?
They -

532
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,912
They loiter at libraries.

533
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,206
They wear plastic bags
for shoes and hats.

534
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,083
- Mm-hmm.
- They go to the park.

535
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,419
- They do a lot of park sitting.
- We could go to the park.

536
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,505
We could. It's nippy.
It's a bit nippy.

537
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,966
Do you know that Gilda Radner Way
is right there?

538
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,051
- I did know that.
- I never knew that.

539
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,430
Yep. I've actually always wanted
to establish a headquarters there.

540
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,098
- A headquarters?
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,934
Interesting. One of many headquarters.
One of a constellation.

542
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,938
- I'm gonna start a bunch of headquarters.
- Interesting. Cool.

543
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,567
I live, like, four blocks from here, and
my mom and sister are gone for the week.

544
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,569
- That's great.
- We could have tea.

545
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,988
- Sounds like an indoor park.
- It's nice.

546
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,782
So, yeah. I don't have
any beer or anything, but -

547
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,993
- It'll do. Let's do it.
- Okay. It's this way.

548
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,537
- That way? Great.
- Awesome.

549
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,502
Before you got here,
someone offered me marijuana.

550
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,921
Did they offer it to you too?

551
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,592
So, yeah, this is my mom's studio.

552
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,220
Mm. It's nice.

553
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,931
It's big. It's huge.

554
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,183
- Pretty big.
- What does she do?

555
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,185
- She's an artist.
- Oh, yeah?

556
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,811
Mm-hmm.

557
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,899
- What kind?
- Photos, mostly.

558
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,863
- Photos of really small things.
- Yeah, for the most part.

559
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,115
- These are miniatures, right?
- Mm-hmm.

560
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,201
That's cool.

561
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,627
- And she's successful?
- Yeah, she's pretty successful.

562
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,630
We live upstairs, but I just came
down here to feed my hamster...

563
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,966
- whose name is actually Gilda.
- A hamster?

564
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,676
- Yeah.
- Old-school.

565
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,386
Yeah.

566
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,888
Look. Check her out.

567
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,558
She's so cute.
She's asleep in her food bowl.

568
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,145
Ah.

569
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:42,108
I don't want to be a downer, but that -
I'm pretty sure this animal is dead.

570
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:46,153
No way. She's just asleep
on her side, really comfortable.

571
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,155
See how she's not moving
when you do that?

572
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,199
Look at her eyes.

573
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,662
She's definitely - She's gone.

574
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,789
She's passed.

575
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,584
Oh, my God.

576
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,336
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

577
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,840
Yeah, I think you're right.
I think that she is dead.

578
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,135
- Okay.
- I wouldn't - Yeah.

579
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,347
Are you sure I can just
put her in the freezer?

580
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,683
Mm-hmm. I'm positive.

581
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,311
Just make sure that bag
is tightly sealed.

582
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,316
I'm so sorry.
What a weird introduction to my house.

583
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,068
It's okay.
It's a beautiful house.

584
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,863
- It's gorgeous. Huge.
- It's not mine, obviously.

585
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,198
I've actually only been back here
for, like, two weeks.

586
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:34,035
I was in college in Ohio,
and I stayed there for the summer.

587
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,829
And so now I'm planning to move out,
but I needed to get a job first...

588
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,498
and now I'm starting
a new job tomorrow.

589
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,459
Tomorrow? Wow. Cool.
Doin' what?

590
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,712
- I'm a hostess.
- A hostess? Interesting.

591
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,548
At this place just around the corner
called Clandestino.

592
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,926
It's closed during the day,
so basically my job is just to...

593
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,929
take reservations, make sure
nothing disastrous happens.

594
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,057
And they call that being a hostess?

595
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,225
- Mm-hmm.
- That's generous.

596
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,148
- What kind of tea do you want?
- I want some good tea.

597
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,567
Okay. I have...

598
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,530
Sleepytime,
I have China Green Tips...

599
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,741
Mexican Sweet Chili, and, uh...

600
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,662
Smooth Move herbal stimulant
laxative tea, which is not mine.

601
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,498
Can I still have it, the laxative one?

602
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,794
- What kind of business are you here on?
- I'm here for the laxative tea.

603
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,837
No, I mean
why are you in New York?

604
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,923
I'm in New York to develop
some television show ideas.

605
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,300
Oh, cool. For what network?

606
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,427
Well, uh, we met with HBO last week...

607
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,180
and Comedy Central
has expressed some interest.

608
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,600
So basically, now the agent's sort of
shopping around to a few different places...

609
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,645
and seeing where
it might be the best fit.

610
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,231
- You have an agent. Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,149
Big-time whoa.

612
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,443
Where are you staying in the city?

613
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,821
I am staying in hell.

614
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,823
Perhaps you've heard of it.

615
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,991
They call it Bushwick.

616
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,577
A studio space in Bushwick.

617
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,664
But, uh, it's pretty close to hell.

618
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,958
You know, I don't know
if this is a weird offer...

619
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,128
but my mom and sister
are gone for the entire week.

620
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,381
They're visiting colleges.
And so I have the whole place to myself.

621
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,384
Frankly, I feel greedy
keeping it that way.

622
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,803
You could totally crash here
if you wanted to.

623
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,432
Is that a genuine offer?

624
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,917
Hello?

625
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,046
- Jed?
- I'm in here.

626
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,015
Is this a good spot?

627
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,058
Yeah, it's fine.

628
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:08,314
- This is my mom's room.
- Okay.

629
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,316
Can I get you anything?

630
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,277
I found a towel in there,
so we're all good.

631
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,653
Okay.

632
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,698
I have to be up for work at 8:00.
Do you have to be up at any specific time?

633
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,366
Hmm-mm. I do not.

634
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,827
Okay, then.
I guess I'll just let you get to sleep.

635
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,829
Great. Good night.

636
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,331
- Good night.
- Sweet dreams.

637
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,374
Yeah, you too.

638
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,050
How many on the books tonight?

639
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,885
Um -

640
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:24,265
How many? On the books?

641
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,308
Reservations?

642
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,271
Oh! I can absolutely
look at that for you.

643
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,732
Hold on. One, two -

644
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,739
I guess you like to know
what to prepare for.

645
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,075
Yep.

646
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,202
What time do you usually come in?

647
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,956
Uh, depends.
This morning I took my time.

648
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,958
Did some readin'
in a pretty good book.

649
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,211
- Oh, yeah? What book?
- The Road. Cormac McCarthy.

650
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,131
Mm. That's a favorite of Oprah's.

651
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,466
That is a relief.

652
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,636
- Nah, it's pretty compelling.
- Yeah?

653
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,805
- This your first day?
- Mm-hmm.

654
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,099
They, uh, just showed me
the phones and left, so -

655
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,772
Good afternoon.
Clandestino.

656
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,652
- They hung up.
- Nice work.

657
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,905
I'm totally useless.

658
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:25,284
Look, pretty much all you need
to know is that these guys...

659
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,037
are the laziest
fuckin' guys in the world.

660
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,665
Your job mostly consists of
making sure they're not sleeping...

661
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,667
or molesting you.

662
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,045
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

663
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,047
They touch inappropriately...

664
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,467
and they do not do what they're told.

665
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,886
Hey, Sayeed.

666
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,555
Hey, Sayeed,
could you set table five?

667
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,599
See? Worthless.

668
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,518
Nice earrings, by the way.

669
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,646
Thanks.

670
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,859
- Ah!
- Oh, come on.

671
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,862
- It doesn't really hurt.
- It does hurt.

672
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,035
You sure this a bow?
It feels really weird and un-bowlike.

673
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,912
Trust me.

674
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,997
You're gonna love it.

675
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,668
What was college like?

676
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,338
I don't know.
It was funny.

677
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:23,050
I felt so sure that I'd found
the best friends I would ever have.

678
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,219
Just, like, these nice, open girls...

679
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:28,764
who were interested
in music and art and baking.

680
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,058
- Baking?
- Yeah.

681
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,811
They would be sort of, like, serious
and buttoned-up during the day...

682
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:37,398
and then at night, to really get crazy,
they would have these hobbies like baking...

683
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,525
or for a while they were
really into miniature furniture...

684
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:43,779
like building little 1950s dinette sets
out of balsa wood.

685
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,198
Were you into that?
Building little...

686
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,242
wooden dinette sets?

687
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,744
I was into all of it, but then
I realized that there was sort of...

688
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,248
a way that they didn't totally get it.

689
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,417
Like your jokes?

690
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,129
Oh, they got jokes. Frankie definitely
gets jokes. You're gonna meet Frankie.

691
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,840
She's finishing up some research,
but she's gonna move here...

692
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,967
and I think we're getting
an apartment together.

693
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:09,054
Oh yeah? Where?
In, like, Fort Greene or Bed-Stuy?

694
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,265
I know. It's hard
to imagine leaving Tribeca.

695
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,308
It's very convenient.

696
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,645
You know,
the thing about your friends -

697
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,189
they weren't assholes, were they?

698
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,233
No, not at all.

699
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,777
See? That's the problem.
Our people are assholes.

700
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,489
- Our moms are assholes.
- You think my mom's an asshole?

701
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,451
Yeah.
She's too successful not to be.

702
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,914
Did you invite someone over?

703
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,916
What a day.

704
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,252
Big day today. Long day.

705
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,629
What have you guys been up to?

706
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,132
I had this meeting in midtown today.
It went so well...

707
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,843
the guy sent me to
this other guy in SoHo...

708
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,970
but I didn't have a MetroCard,
so when I told the guy in midtown -

709
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,598
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

710
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,059
You remember Jed.
We met him at Ashlynn's party.

711
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,812
Oh. You're not the guy
who makes those videos...

712
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,606
where you act like an imbecile...

713
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,983
against a badly painted scrim, are you?

714
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,235
- That is I.
- Oh, I don't like you.

715
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,863
You have this sort of DIY aspect.

716
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,491
- Charlotte!
- The lady can speak her mind.

717
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,161
It's okay.
Are you guys hungry?

718
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,956
- Not hungry.
- We just ate a little while ago.

719
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,792
You ate. Recently, or -

720
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,086
Are you hungry, or -

721
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:25,005
- I am hungry.
- Well, then, you should get some food.

722
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,217
Well, maybe if I had more money
in my bank account, I would get some food.

723
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,719
You don't have to pay for food.
We have so much frozen stuff here...

724
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,347
including my dead hamster.

725
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,349
Do you have any wine?

726
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,393
I don't think so.
Let me check, but I don't think so.

727
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:53,784
Okay, there's a bunch of red here, but this
is my mom's. I feel like we shouldn't take it.

728
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,912
Oh, come on. There's so much.
She won't miss a bottle.

729
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,914
Do you have a cork pull-y thingy?

730
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,876
Uh, your mom's room,
it gets a little, um, cold at night.

731
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,170
Yeah, I think there's
a little bit of a draft.

732
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,339
Yeah, there's a pretty big draft.

733
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,383
It's noticeable.

734
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,552
It's annoying.
I'm gonna take your sister's room.

735
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,388
Okay.

736
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,391
Listen, if you're Ionely, you can come
with me back to my house...

737
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,686
and we could just take an Ambien
and watch Picnic at Hanging Rock...

738
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,688
or, like, Christiane F. Or something.

739
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,983
I know, but he's here and -

740
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,446
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

741
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,532
Love you.

742
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,306
We don't have anything at 8:00.

743
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,641
No, we have something around 8:00.

744
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,020
Around eight means 7:45 or 8:30.

745
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,105
Yeah.

746
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,402
8:45 we could do.
That would work well.

747
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,739
Mm-hmm.
That's a party of four?

748
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,782
Three? Okay.

749
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,955
Thank you. Yeah.
Have a lovely day.

750
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,337
Who makes reservations
at a restaurant? I would never do that.

751
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:32,799
Parenthetically, I just told that customer
that our house red has grape-y undertones.

752
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:35,135
I really like your chef outfit.

753
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,305
Thank you.
So how are - how are things?

754
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,891
Um, I'm really tired.

755
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:45,103
I took three Klonopin and woke up
next to a spoonful of peanut butter.

756
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,773
- You like pills?
- Yeah.

757
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,817
- You?
- Love.

758
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,445
What can you get for me?

759
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,656
I personally don't have
any prescriptions...

760
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,617
but my friend Charlotte
has an extremely generous doctor.

761
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,328
Well, if you could
get me some Vicodin...

762
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,330
I would be forever grateful.

763
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,374
It's like -

764
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,628
It's like lying naked
on a bearskin rug next to a fire.

765
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,672
Nice.

766
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,194
Whatcha doin'?

767
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,906
Oh, I just...
I got this e-mail from this...

768
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,867
terrible girl I used to know.

769
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,953
Like a girlfriend-type terrible girl?

770
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,747
No, it's this girl I met
at this, um, coffee shop...

771
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:50,335
this, like, horrible trendy coffee shop
in, um, Wicker Park.

772
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:55,299
And, uh, she had seen a few
of my videos and was just, you know...

773
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,552
she was just on my jock,
like, really bad.

774
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,220
On your jock?

775
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,015
She was just pushing,
you know, like, hard.

776
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:06,268
Hmm. So did you, like,
date her or -

777
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,772
Uh, no. The thing about her is, like,
she was just really, like -

778
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,942
She was extremely forthcoming
with the blowies.

779
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,320
- Like, crazily so.
- Whoa.

780
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,947
Yeah, like really, really, really into it.

781
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,491
Like, it got to the point that we weren't
even, like, talking or making out.

782
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,244
It was just like, "hello"
and, like, straight to blowie.

783
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,371
- That seems like it's not -
- It was fine. It was fine.

784
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,417
But it - You know, you also have
to live your life, and it was taking over.

785
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,545
The only time I'd get stuff done
were in the 15 minutes it would take for me...

786
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,547
to reconstitute my boner.

787
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,883
Otherwise, like, my life
was just overrun by this.

788
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,426
- Gross.
- Yeah.

789
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,304
- So I had to walk away eventually. Eventually.
- That must have been hard.

790
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,015
Mm. Yeah.
No pun intended.

791
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,898
Can you handle that?

792
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,911
Hey.

793
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,288
What's goin' on downstairs?

794
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,166
Same shit, different day.

795
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:14,294
Those guys are such
fuckin' dirtbags, man.

796
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,129
I'm just sitting there,
tryin' to read my book...

797
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,133
and they're all crowded around watching
Cum Omelet on somebody's iPhone.

798
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,136
- What is Cum Omelet?
- A porn video.

799
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:27,099
- What happens in it?
- Pretty self-explanatory.

800
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,768
A bunch of dudes come,
cook it in an omelet.

801
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,604
- Then what?
- Some chick has to eat it.

802
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,982
Ugh.
And you're into that?

803
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,984
No.

804
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:39,945
Not a porn guy?

805
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,989
I wouldn't say that.
It's just, uh...

806
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:45,117
I'm into different stuff.

807
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,160
What kind of stuff?

808
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,498
Like some Japanese shit.
Like, uh...

809
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,875
you ever see anything
with tentacle rape?

810
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,753
What is tentacle rape?

811
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,547
Tentacle rape.

812
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:02,008
It's good. It's worth a Google.
You should check it out.

813
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:04,344
What do you like to watch?

814
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,346
Reruns of Seinfeld.

815
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,640
- Porn-wise.
- Nothing.

816
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,309
- Yeah, right.
- I don't.

817
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:14,187
In high school my friend Charlotte
used to drag me to Waldenbooks...

818
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,357
and make me look at this thing
called Sensual Abductions...

819
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:21,236
which is, like, stories about women
being kidnapped and ravaged and -

820
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,697
That turn you on?

821
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,242
None of your business.

822
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,244
I'm hungry.

823
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,582
I'm sure some of the guys downstairs
would be happy to make you an omelet.

824
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,251
You have two unheard messages.

825
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,837
Aura, it's Mom.

826
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,048
Just a reminder that the recycling
can't sit in the basement all weekend.

827
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,385
Please, please help me out.
I don't want to ask Candice to do it again.

828
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,221
And where are you?
I haven't heard from you in a few days.

829
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,600
Can you give us a call?
I'll see you Wednesday, sweetie.

830
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,227
How you doin'?

831
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:58,231
Um, I've left you three messages.

832
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,817
Uh, you may have fallen
down a mine shaft.

833
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,612
I think I found us
an apartment on Craigslist...

834
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:07,365
but I need you to tell me
if it's a scam or not.

835
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:10,076
This is Frankie, by the way.

836
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,372
Okay. I am gonna go to work...

837
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,583
but I'm off at 4:00
and I'll call you around then...

838
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,585
and we can get a falafel or something?

839
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,880
Okay. Well, I'm busy
until 10:00 or 10:30 or so.

840
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:25,342
I have a meeting at 9:00 that I think
will wrap around 10:00 or 10:30.

841
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,803
But I can come back here
and ring the bell when I'm downstairs.

842
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,765
Okay. I might be out
with Charlotte then at some bar.

843
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,434
She thinks the bartender's cute
and wants me to go with her.

844
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,436
Do you have an extra set of keys?

845
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,689
I don't have extra keys, no.
And I should also tell you...

846
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,943
that my mom and sister are
coming back the day after tomorrow.

847
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,279
That's fine.
I'm-I'm a huge hit with moms.

848
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,949
I just think you might want
to find a backup plan...

849
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:52,619
because you'd be sleeping
in a cubicle next to a 17-year-old girl.

850
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,913
It sounds awesome.

851
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,291
Hey, look.
I'm a man in the house, okay?

852
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,043
That's invaluable.

853
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,212
That's what I am, okay?
Do you understand that?

854
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:05,674
Okay. How much longer
are you in town?

855
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,510
A... week and a half.

856
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,972
- Roughly a week and a half.
- Okay.

857
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,848
Um...

858
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:16,977
I think I can make that work.

859
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:22,190
Did you see this story about the woman
who didn't know she was pregnant...

860
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,401
until she gave birth
on a Greyhound bus?

861
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,279
I didn't, but I have dreams
about that all the time -

862
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,406
that I'm pregnant,
and that I don't know...

863
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,533
and then it's too late
for me to get an abortion.

864
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:35,328
Ah, you got a pretty compact body.
I don't think you'd miss the signs.

865
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,790
Yeah, well, my friend Charlotte
says that the Greyhound bus...

866
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,668
is for the dregs of humanity,
so that doesn't surprise me.

867
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,754
Charlotte? With the pills?

868
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,798
Can you make that happen?

869
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,925
You'd need to hang out
with me extracurricularly.

870
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,345
Which would be easy to do.
I live right around the corner...

871
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,973
and my mom is basically never home.

872
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,851
Well, I work till 1:00 most nights...

873
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:01,062
and then, uh, my day off
I gotta spend with my girlfriend.

874
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,523
Oh, yeah.

875
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,900
Yeah, we've been goin'
through some problems...

876
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:08,194
so I gotta put the time in.

877
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:11,573
How's that going?

878
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,491
Shitty.

879
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:16,620
But we've been together for a while.

880
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:20,290
- It's expensive to move out.
- Yeah, that sucks.

881
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,917
I'm really glad I didn't have
to deal with that with my ex.

882
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,837
He moved to Colorado,
and then the guy I'm dating now is like...

883
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,298
basically living with me,
which is too much.

884
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,383
You're dating someone?

885
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:34,054
Yeah, I mean,
I'm trying to keep it really casual.

886
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,723
He's kind of a big deal on YouTube.

887
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,398
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hey.

888
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,859
- I'm so glad you're home.
- I've been trying to get in touch with you.

889
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:52,030
- I left you lots of voice mails and stuff.
- My phone's off. What's up?

890
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,825
What's up is
I went to pour myself a glass of wine.

891
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,869
Really tired.
Want to lie down in my bed.

892
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,413
Ten bottles of wine are gone.
One left.

893
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,208
Okay, I don't really know what to -

894
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,795
And who slept in my bed?
Somebody slept in my bed.

895
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:10,674
I slept in your bed. My mattress
is uncomfortable, so I slept in your bed.

896
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,636
Candice told me she saw some guy
walking around the loft at around 11:00 a. M...

897
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,180
after you went to work - way after.

898
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:20,350
What was Candice doing
walking around the loft?

899
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,103
Candice should stay in the studio.

900
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,605
- Candice is a bitch.
- Candice is a bitch?

901
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,066
- Yeah, Can-
- Candice works for me.

902
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,485
Candice comes up here to do things.

903
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,780
Candice is up and down,
up and down.

904
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:37,742
Okay. Well, it makes me uncomfortable,
the idea of Candice walking around my space.

905
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,869
Candice said the place
reeked of pot.

906
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,789
That was not my fault.
There's no way that was my fault.

907
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,583
You know that there's a kid
across the air shaft...

908
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,961
who smokes a ton of weed
and will never wave at Nadine.

909
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,797
Okay, but you didn't drink the wine.
Who drank the wine?

910
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:54,426
This is Charlotte. I think Charlotte
is such an incredibly bad influence.

911
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:58,805
- That's so untrue.
- She's unsupervised, out of control -

912
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,182
That's not true.
She's with her dad all the time.

913
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,184
He takes her to openings
all the time.

914
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,979
Bob would go to the opening
of a fucking envelope...

915
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,107
and I'm sure he wishes people
think that Charlotte's his date.

916
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,818
- He is so skeevy -
- You are being very cruel.

917
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,820
- No.
- Charlotte is my best friend.

918
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,822
For two weeks.
The last two weeks.

919
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,824
For my whole life
Charlotte's been my best friend...

920
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,410
and she's also the only person
who seems to care that I'm home.

921
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,454
All you seem to care about
is the wine...

922
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,497
and if you care so much,
I'll buy you new wine.

923
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,958
- With what money?
- I have a job.

924
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,003
Did you not hear me last week
when I told you that I have a job?

925
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,173
- I heard you. I heard you.
- I just got out of school.

926
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,508
This is a very hard time for me.

927
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:39,095
If you didn't notice,
I had my heart broken, okay?

928
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,681
I am a young, young person...

929
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,350
who is trying very hard.

930
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,644
And I don't know if you know
what it's like to have a job.

931
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,815
Did you ever have a job that wasn't just
taking pictures of stupid, tiny crap?

932
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,776
- No.
- Yeah!

933
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,069
Exactly! Exactly!

934
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:58,448
- Could you stop shrieking, please?
- No, I won't stop shrieking...

935
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,701
because I don't understand
why you are doing this to me.

936
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,204
What do you want?

937
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,206
'Cause you two are
some kind of gang.

938
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,750
- That is so not true.
- You're a gang!

939
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,752
You with the kitty litter, okay?

940
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,254
You with the wine
and the stuff all over the house.

941
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,590
I'm asking to be heard.
Just to be heard.

942
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,884
I am asking to be heard!

943
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,011
You don't hear anything I say.

944
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,598
You don't care
about anything I say or feel.

945
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,892
Neither of you.

946
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:29,354
And you're just looking at me
like I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy!

947
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,356
- No.
- This is my house too!

948
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,108
- I know.
- And nobody acts that way!

949
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:37,195
You act like it's all your house!
It's all your stupid shit!

950
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,197
- Would you please just -
- It's all over the house!

951
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,199
- Stop it!
- No! I hate you!

952
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,827
- Could you stop it, please?
- I really, really, really hate you!

953
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,870
- I really hate you.
- All right, all right.

954
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,748
- I really hate you, so leave me alone!
- Leave her alone.

955
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,334
- I didn't do anything.
- Just -

956
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,255
- It's not funny.
- Just help me pick this up.

957
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,096
- Look what I have.
- What?

958
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,974
Paper furniture. You want it?

959
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,935
- Hmm-mm.
- It's much too fragile for me to use.

960
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,979
I don't want it.

961
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:56,983
- Are you hungry?
- No.

962
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,987
You know, when I was your age,
I never had a job.

963
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,866
I never could do anything.
I had no motivation whatsoever.

964
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,535
So I'm pretty impressed with you.

965
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:11,372
I am.

966
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,001
I'm sorry I yelled at you so loudly.

967
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,170
It's okay. I don't care.

968
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,054
I'm having a really hard time.

969
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,973
- I'm sorry.
- I really am.

970
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,852
- Am I crushing you?
- Mm, a little bit.

971
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,146
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yeah.

972
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,192
I have this friend. I haven't made any
new friends since I got back from school.

973
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,321
And I have this friend named Jed.
He's really cool. We have a lot in common.

974
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:47,033
He's just in New York for two weeks,
and the place he was staying fell through.

975
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,202
- And I was wondering if you -
- No.

976
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,829
- You didn't even listen.
- What?

977
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,582
I was wondering if maybe he could just
stay here for a couple of nights...

978
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,501
until he figured out somewhere else.

979
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,212
- No. That's really weird for Nadine.
- Why?

980
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,381
Because her bed
is right through your wall.

981
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,509
- Then he could sleep in the studio.
- This is where I work.

982
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,929
Okay. Mom, I'm 22.

983
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,014
I just - He's -
We're not sleeping together.

984
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,350
- He could go on the blow-up mattress -
- That's even weirder.

985
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,310
Why?

986
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,771
Mom, please?

987
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:20,441
It's not a big deal. It's the kind of thing
most moms would think was not a big deal.

988
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,527
Okay, just for a couple nights.

989
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,779
Thank you.

990
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,532
I love you. Thank you.

991
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,534
Thank you.

992
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,953
- Hey. How are you?
- Good. How are you?

993
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,580
- Good, thank you. Come in.
- Thank you.

994
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:36,624
- How's it goin'?
- It's good. How are you?

995
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,795
Do you want to meet my mom really fast?

996
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,297
- She's here? Yeah. I'd love to. For sure.
- Cool.

997
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,383
She's right over here.

998
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,595
- Mom? Nadine?
- Hi.

999
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,097
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1000
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,724
- Hello.
- This is Jed.

1001
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,726
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well. Hello.

1002
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,438
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Likewise. Thanks for letting me stay here.

1003
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,273
- Not a problem.
- I really appreciate it.

1004
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,649
- Not a problem.
- Cool.

1005
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,402
- Cool. So we're gonna be in the back.
- Great.

1006
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,446
- See ya.
- All right. Nice meeting you.

1007
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,198
- We can just go back that way.
- Back here?

1008
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,367
"June 22, 1974.

1009
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,162
Terry got a perm.
She looks beautiful.

1010
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,164
I am jealous.
Even though things have changed...

1011
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,624
and I seem to have joined the ranks
of the beautiful, I am jealous.

1012
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,420
An awful day at work. I hate
being a receptionist, even at a museum.

1013
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:26,424
My cousin Stephen came in and just
stared at me until I recognized him."

1014
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,554
You okay down there?

1015
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,932
I think the mattress is deflating.

1016
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,642
No way.

1017
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,145
It is. It's defeCtive.

1018
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:42,190
It's devastating.

1019
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:46,444
- So you're just sinking?
- I'm sinking... slowly.

1020
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,821
It's a mathematical certainty.

1021
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,657
I don't have anything else
for you to sleep on...

1022
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,452
so maybe you should just
get in my bed.

1023
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,789
Nah.

1024
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,167
Sorry. Jesus.

1025
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:05,379
Girls sweat up the bed.

1026
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,050
I don't sweat up the bed.

1027
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,345
Has anyone ever told you
that you sweat up a bed?

1028
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:15,098
- No one's ever said that.
- Never ever?

1029
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,350
- Never ever.
- Okay.

1030
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,397
When'd you get that mattress?

1031
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:25,525
Mm, I don't know.
Like, two years ago.

1032
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,652
Ah, it's defective.

1033
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,196
Still have a warranty on it?

1034
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:33,199
I don't know.
I don't save stuff like that.

1035
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,879
- You can just turn out the light if you want.
- Okay.

1036
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:54,971
It might be a little bit cozy,
but we will definitely make it work.

1037
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,973
Thank you so much.

1038
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,892
Okay. See you Tuesday.

1039
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,270
I am so sorry I'm late.
There was a whole thing -

1040
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:06,274
My mom locked herself out of the house,
and no one else has keys, and -

1041
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,527
- I really like your dress.
- It's a jumpsuit.

1042
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,613
Listen, Aura, I need you
to be here at 10:00 a.m. Sharp...

1043
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,615
when the phone starts ringing, okay?

1044
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,536
I mean, I can't be downstairs wondering
if you're up here doing your job.

1045
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,747
- I am really, really -
- No. It's no biggie. It's okay.

1046
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:33,426
How are the busboys treatin' you?
Anyone molest you yet today?

1047
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,428
No one but you.

1048
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,597
If I were gonna molest you,
you would know.

1049
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,807
Hey, I get off early tonight.
What are you doin'?

1050
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,768
- Um -
- I got a joint if you got those pills.

1051
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,479
- I could probably -
- Meet me at the corner of Houston and A...

1052
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:48,357
at 11:00.

1053
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,781
We have to tart you up a bit.

1054
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:57,783
Are you sure it's okay
if I take some Xanax?

1055
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,620
- I feel bad, but he really wants Xanax.
- It's absolutely fine.

1056
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,831
- Maybe you should surprise him with oxys.
- What about this?

1057
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,833
What do you think of this?

1058
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,961
Absolutely not. You need something
that shows your little tits off.

1059
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,256
You have the greatest little tits.
They're like a 1960s porn star...

1060
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,926
with those puffy little nipples you have.

1061
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,386
Oh, my God. That reminds me of this thing
that I just read in my mom's journal.

1062
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,347
It's so funny. Listen to this.

1063
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,307
Okay.

1064
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,811
"I think of myself a lot
as this weird mutation from the '50s.

1065
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:28,731
Doris Day in SoHo.
What a disgusting thought."

1066
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:31,317
You know, I know how she feels.
Sometimes I think of myself...

1067
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,195
as Tribeca's solution
to Marianne Faithfull.

1068
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:37,949
Charlotte, I feel so unprepared. Okay,
so I go there and meet him on the corner.

1069
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,201
We smoke a joint,
and then what do I do?

1070
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,954
Just take him somewhere
and grab his cock.

1071
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,539
You know,
just do something spontaneous.

1072
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,541
I don't know.
I'm not awesome like you.

1073
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,670
I just broke up with a male feminist
after three years. I'm not a cock-grabber.

1074
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,589
Let me tell you something.
When I was 16...

1075
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,675
I was absolutely
in love with this man.

1076
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,927
I mean,
I was head over heels for him.

1077
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,263
One time we were in SoHo...

1078
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:02,640
and we broke
into this residential park...

1079
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,184
and it was late at night,
and it was raining.

1080
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:09,146
And it was so romantic.
And I was so sure he'd kiss me.

1081
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,857
And then he just reached over...

1082
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,026
and he just grabbed my cunt.

1083
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,529
And I was really traumatized.

1084
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,199
I was supersad for, like,
a long time after that.

1085
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,201
And then one day I just got over it...

1086
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,912
and I realized that
that's what you call "spontaneous."

1087
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,456
I guess so.

1088
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,583
You know what?
Just wear my top.

1089
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,713
It's the only option.

1090
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,174
You don't have to do this. It's a beautiful
tank top, but you don't have to do this.

1091
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,593
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

1092
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,888
Hopefully he'll replace this awful Jeb.

1093
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:45,391
- Jed.
- Whatever. That guy's a loafer...

1094
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,226
and he doesn't deserve you.

1095
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,270
I don't deserve you.

1096
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,272
Speaking of which...

1097
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,400
my father's friend Philippe
is curating this show in Dumbo.

1098
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,360
It's this group show.

1099
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,654
And I said that we're gonna
put one of your pieces in.

1100
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,406
- Really?
- Yeah.

1101
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,700
It's gonna be put on one
of those cool little white monitors...

1102
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,911
and I think it's a great opportunity.

1103
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,747
Aura?

1104
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,457
Hi, Siri.

1105
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,461
Oh! Sweetie. Long time.

1106
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,921
You reek of cigarettes,
and I owe your mom a call.

1107
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,882
Oh, no. I wouldn't worry about it.

1108
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,967
She's pretty distracted by this...

1109
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,219
sheepherder she's fucking.

1110
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:26,182
All the frozen entrees are gone,
with the exception of this?

1111
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:30,061
- Oh, my God. Is that your dead rat?
- I'm really sorry.

1112
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,271
I have not found a place to bury Gilda yet,
but I will buy you new ones.

1113
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,273
My paycheck comes next week.

1114
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,734
I wouldn't get too excited
about that paycheck.

1115
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,363
It's pretty disappointing.
After a while, I just stopped picking mine up.

1116
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,740
I know who ate everything.

1117
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,242
This is not a boarding house.

1118
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,454
This is not a food bank.
This is not a bed-and-breakfast.

1119
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,623
This is my home.
I paid for this food.

1120
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,666
It's not for you to share.

1121
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:55,795
Do you have the same sense
of entitlement as my daughter?

1122
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,798
Oh, believe me, mine is much worse.

1123
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,336
Can't believe he stood me up.

1124
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,424
Dude sounds like a real meatball.

1125
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,177
Should I give him a second chance?

1126
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,179
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

1127
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,140
No way.

1128
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,058
No way. Absolutely not.

1129
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:54,687
You get ditched like that once, that's it.
That's a - That's a life ban.

1130
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:56,814
That's forever.

1131
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,024
Not always.
I feel like there's a situation -

1132
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,360
There's no fuckin' situation.
That's it.

1133
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,362
I'm telling you.
You don't - You don't do that.

1134
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,283
Like, if you - Relationships aren't -
You know, it's not rocket science.

1135
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:11,579
If you find yourself having to really think
about it a lot, analyzing it, it's over.

1136
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,747
It's kaput. I'm telling you.

1137
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,750
- Yeah?
- Like, look. You know, we met.

1138
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:20,171
I thought,
"Hey, you know, this is a funny chick.

1139
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,339
This is nice. This is easy."

1140
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:26,552
You know, I don't - I'm not worrying about
whether or not we're gonna, you know...

1141
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:29,555
make out or some
fucking nonsense, you know?

1142
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:33,350
It's no big whoop. And that's how
it's supposed to be, you know?

1143
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,270
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1144
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,608
By the way, you do sweat the bed.

1145
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,276
I don't.

1146
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:45,821
Probably more than
the average female, I would say.

1147
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:00,211
What's up?

1148
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,472
You get him out of our house.

1149
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:15,476
- What?
- I want him out of my home.

1150
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,480
He's not doing anything.
He's only been in my room.

1151
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,607
He's in my laundry room
mixing lights and darks.

1152
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:24,568
- He doesn't have any other place to go.
- That is not my problem.

1153
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,279
You are not even having sex
with that person.

1154
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,241
I am going out
with Jane and Pierre tonight...

1155
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,535
and when I return, he is gone.

1156
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:35,746
- Fine.
- You're late for work again.

1157
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,176
- Hey.
- Hey.

1158
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,637
- What's up?
- Not much.

1159
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,473
You?

1160
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,142
Same shit, different day.

1161
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,228
I thought you'd made
that expression up,

1162
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:02,314
but it turns out
it's just something people say.

1163
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:07,611
Yeah, look.
I'm sorry about last night, all right?

1164
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,655
I couldn't get out of the house.

1165
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:14,577
My girlfriend went crazy. She found
these texts that my ex wrote and -

1166
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:19,957
Can I tell you a secret?

1167
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:23,419
- Fucking hate this job.
- Yeah, so do I.

1168
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:26,755
As soon as I get a big enough nut,
I'm gonna quit.

1169
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,091
I think I might quit today.

1170
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,051
Like, now.

1171
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,390
I'm really sorry.

1172
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,392
Yeah. I just figured, you know...

1173
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,979
an artist, an open lady, you know.

1174
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,482
I think you made her out to be
a little bit more...

1175
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,859
relaxed than she really is.

1176
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,654
I'm really sorry.
I mean, I would totally understand...

1177
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:36,075
if you were mad at me,
and I hope that you're not.

1178
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,369
Yeah. I just think you should -

1179
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,791
I think you should make sure you can deliver
something before you promise it, you know?

1180
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,918
Well, I didn't, like, not deliver.

1181
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:48,587
I mean, you stayed in the house
for a week, but -

1182
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:52,007
No, I know. You're totally right.
So... I'm sorry.

1183
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,010
And I hope that we can
hang out more before you go.

1184
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,346
Okay. Well, we'll see.

1185
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,641
I'm staying all the way in Queens,
which is a bit of a trek, but -

1186
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,226
- Okay.
- We'll see.

1187
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,354
All right.
I'm a cowboy at dusk.

1188
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,439
Bye.

1189
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,748
Hey, what's up?
Where's Jed?

1190
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,293
- Mom made me kick him out.
- Ooh, bummer.

1191
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,797
Is it okay if I have
a few kids over later?

1192
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,926
- How many is a few?
- I don't know. Like, six or something?

1193
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,858
What the hell is going on here?

1194
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,068
More kids came than I thought
were gonna come.

1195
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,904
Uh, yeah, I should say so.
There's, like, 25 kids here.

1196
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,366
Mom's not gonna be home till 1:00.
It's not that big a deal.

1197
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,952
Maybe it's not a big deal to you.
It's a big deal to me.

1198
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,371
Having drunk minors
in the house is a liability.

1199
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,498
No one here is drunk.

1200
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,920
Oh, my God.
You've got to turn the music down.

1201
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,131
I'm not in charge of the music.

1202
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,219
Excuse me.
You have got to turn the music down.

1203
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,721
What?

1204
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,724
You have got to turn the music down.

1205
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,485
- I came as soon as I could.
- They're out of control.

1206
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,863
Don't worry. Wrangling
teenage boys is a specialty of mine.

1207
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:43,577
The problem isn't the volume.
It's that there's nothing danceable.

1208
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,538
You guys are playing all this shit.

1209
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,749
How about something to move to?

1210
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,751
Oh, my - Oh!

1211
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:54,463
And if you get a fucking boner,
I'll kill you.

1212
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,301
- Charlotte, please come with me.
- I can't move to this.

1213
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,220
I just can't move.

1214
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,472
Holy shit.

1215
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,061
God, they are out of control.

1216
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,773
- You were right.
- Oh, really?

1217
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,901
Yeah, they're really being bad.

1218
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,656
Look, what can I do?
Do you want something to eat?

1219
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,242
Listen, I want something to eat.
Let's go into the kitchen.

1220
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,662
Let's scrum into the kitchen
and get a crust of bread or cheese.

1221
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:31,583
I feel very hot
and dizzy and constricted.

1222
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,752
Right, yeah.

1223
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,547
Well, um, we can fix it.

1224
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:58,402
Nadine?

1225
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,571
You are going to listen
to me right now.

1226
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,282
Do you hear something?
I just hear absolutely nothing.

1227
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:07,953
Yeah, I just got a picture of your sister
and her friend walking by. No pants.

1228
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,540
Haven't you ever been
to the beach, you silly sod?

1229
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:15,294
You are going to come into the kitchen,
and you're going to talk to me.

1230
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,296
- Nope.
- Come with me now.

1231
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,298
I'm not speaking to you.

1232
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,050
Like hell you're not speaking to me.

1233
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,975
- What?
- I don't get why you care.

1234
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,728
- You don't get why I care?
- No, I don't get why you care.

1235
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:35,898
I think the issue is that
it reflects badly on Aura's authority.

1236
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,983
You know what else reflects badly?

1237
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:41,653
Walking through my party
with no pants on.

1238
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,822
- That's a good point.
- So you admit it's a party?

1239
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,658
I admit it's humiliating
because you're so desperate...

1240
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:51,038
that you crave attention from
17-year-old boys, that's what I admit.

1241
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:55,334
Okay, you can be mad about the way
I handled this or whatever, but this is your bad.

1242
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,837
There are 25 kids here.
They are drinking. They are making -

1243
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,715
And you're so desperate
it's disgusting...

1244
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:05,135
and you put yourself on YouTube
so millions of people can see you...

1245
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,180
and that homeless guy who was staying
in our house wouldn't even fuck you.

1246
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,682
And to be honest, I'm ashamed
we have the same mother.

1247
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,976
I'm ashamed
because you disgust me.

1248
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,020
You fucking disgust me!

1249
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,189
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Don't hit me!

1250
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,524
Don't hit me because it doesn't hurt!

1251
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:22,819
I think this is wildly unnecessary.
You two are both artic...

1252
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,364
I don't like to get mad at people
who aren't in my family...

1253
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,991
but no one cares what you think.

1254
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,285
- Do not -
- Don't hit me again.

1255
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:34,373
Go to your fucking room.
Go to your fucking room!

1256
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:47,636
Charlotte?

1257
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,763
Charlotte?

1258
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,724
Charlotte, will you move over
just a little bit, please?

1259
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,994
Mom.

1260
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,079
- Mom.
- Hmm?

1261
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:17,082
Were there any kids here
when you got home?

1262
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,001
No, no kids.

1263
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,669
- Mom?
- Hmm?

1264
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:23,171
Charlotte is asleep in my bed,
and she's taking up the whole thing...

1265
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:26,591
- and it's making me really sad.
- That's good.

1266
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,260
Mom?

1267
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:31,596
I took an Ambien.

1268
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:33,598
Can I sleep in here?

1269
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:35,642
No room.

1270
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,653
Nadine?

1271
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,655
What? What?

1272
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,825
I'm really sorry about earlier, okay?
You just put me in a really bad position.

1273
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:55,120
Okay, it's fine. It's fine.

1274
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,831
- Nadine?
- What?

1275
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:01,084
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1276
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,883
No! No!

1277
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:09,718
Shh!

1278
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,390
- Hi!
- Hey.

1279
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:01,353
I'm literally packing
the last box as we speak.

1280
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,106
This may be
the first time in my life...

1281
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,858
that I'm completely ready
for something.

1282
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,902
I just quit my job.

1283
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:12,572
At the restaurant?
Didn't you just start?

1284
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,242
Yeah, well,
it was really boring, and shitty...

1285
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,327
and I have a college degree...

1286
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,872
so I didn't really see any reason
to continue with that.

1287
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,334
We picked the worst
possible time to graduate.

1288
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,878
But the good news is
rents are lower...

1289
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,714
so we can find a place
that's in our price range...

1290
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:32,509
that isn't, like, a total roach motel.

1291
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:37,097
Frankie, I don't feel like this is
the best time for me to do this.

1292
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,724
If it's a financial thing,
my dad said that he can...

1293
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,310
cover security and first month's...

1294
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,147
and you can just get us back later.

1295
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:47,149
I mean, it is that.

1296
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:50,443
It's definitely that, 'cause I don't have
a job anymore. But it's also not that.

1297
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:54,781
My mom is becoming, you know,
sort of dependent on having me around.

1298
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,909
I help watch the house.
I take care of Nadine.

1299
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,204
And I really had trouble
making this decision...

1300
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,041
but I realized it's the best thing
for me to be at home right now.

1301
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:08,253
And I feel pretty guilty going.

1302
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:10,297
Okay.

1303
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,467
And you couldn't have told me
about this a little earlier?

1304
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:17,721
I get there tomorrow, Aura.

1305
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:21,224
I kind of didn't know until today,
and I figured that you're staying with Jess...

1306
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,269
so you're not gonna be completely
homeless when you get here.

1307
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,354
Yeah, temporarily.

1308
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,315
But I need a roommate.

1309
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,317
Craigslist?

1310
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,944
Someone just got murdered
off Craigslist.

1311
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:48,126
"I better watch it.
I'm a little worried about me.

1312
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:50,629
I am not behaving
in a rational manner.

1313
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,048
I am creating enemies
left and right.

1314
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,383
Alienating people,
particularly Michelle.

1315
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,929
I just got afraid that I was
similar to Ed, the landlord.

1316
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,306
Here's a new list
of things I want:

1317
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:04,809
A violin bow, a lover - and please
let it work to make me happy.

1318
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,312
My luck in love
is always so poor.

1319
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,105
To start getting
my art together...

1320
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,192
to weigh 128 to 125
and be happy...

1321
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:15,654
a toe operation,
a dulcimer, a black beret...

1322
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,490
sunglasses, new journal,
the floor sanded...

1323
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:21,576
to learn to use a dark room,
and to make little movies...

1324
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,788
ones that have me in them."

1325
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:29,209
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm, I'm okay.

1326
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:32,128
My lower back feels
like it's about to spasm.

1327
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,839
How do I look?

1328
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:37,592
Positively model-esque.
Where are you going?

1329
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,594
Some Dalton party.

1330
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,680
I like it when you go out because...

1331
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,015
I do not like what happens
when you stay in.

1332
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,853
Mom, Charlotte put my video
in this opening in Dumbo...

1333
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:52,857
and I'm gonna go, so that means
neither of us will be here.

1334
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:54,693
You gonna be okay?

1335
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,903
She's just gonna watch
Rachel Maddow, eat macaroons...

1336
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,322
and lay on the heating pad.

1337
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,366
I'll be fine.

1338
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,870
- I'm nervous.
- Well, don't be.

1339
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:08,832
It's more like a salon
than a gallery.

1340
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,668
But what if my work isn't right
for an art context?

1341
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,296
I think everything's
right for every context.

1342
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:17,549
- And you can quote me.
- Also, I texted the chef.

1343
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:21,303
Oh, that's why you're nervous.

1344
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,347
Oh, my God, and my mom
will not stop calling me.

1345
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,058
Ignore. Ignore.

1346
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,731
Doesn't it look great?

1347
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,941
I don't know. There's no sound.

1348
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:38,320
No, but the placement is beautiful.

1349
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:42,949
Plus, you're just so concerned
with having things look polished and perfect.

1350
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:46,494
Any exposure's good exposure.

1351
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,496
I guess.

1352
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:52,625
- Oh, my God. There he is.
- Who?

1353
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:55,962
Philippe.
He curated this whole thing.

1354
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:59,257
Oh, my God. You don't know
what I would give to fuck him.

1355
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,800
Him?

1356
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,011
He is old like a dad.

1357
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,805
No. You have to get what I'm into.

1358
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,350
Who is it?

1359
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:13,188
Oh, my God. Hi.

1360
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,940
- Hi.
- Mm!

1361
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:17,942
Oh, my God. Hi.

1362
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:23,114
Oh, whoa! You're here!

1363
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:27,118
Well, I figured I had to
track you down somehow.

1364
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,621
You didn't text me back the address...

1365
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,916
so I've literally been wandering
around the neighborhood for an hour.

1366
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,710
I'm so sorry.
You look beautiful.

1367
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,672
- Where's your piece?
- Oh.

1368
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,592
It's just the college fountain video.
You've seen it before.

1369
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,594
I love that one.

1370
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,013
- I'm Charlotte.
- Oh, of course.

1371
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,641
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Oh, yeah. Childhood tales.

1372
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,310
Aura likes to make it sound
like I was the naughty one...

1373
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,188
but she was such a selfish cunt.

1374
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:58,066
But, you know, all relationships
have a mythology, don't they?

1375
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,068
Do you have a piece
in the show as well?

1376
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:03,988
No. I curated the thing.
One.

1377
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,161
Nice outfit.

1378
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,955
Charlotte dressed me.

1379
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,999
I guess we're not in Kansas anymore.

1380
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:17,043
Did you throw out your clogs?

1381
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,045
I didn't.
I mean, they're somewhere.

1382
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,214
I don't know where,
but they're somewhere.

1383
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:25,176
How's staying with Steph? I feel like
her newfound lesbianism would be a huge -

1384
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:28,138
If we're really gonna talk,
we should just go somewhere.

1385
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,014
What do you mean?

1386
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:35,687
I just feel as though we have
some things to discuss.

1387
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,355
Like what?

1388
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,399
Aura.

1389
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:44,863
You decided you didn't want to
live together, and that's fine...

1390
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:47,824
but you told me
the day before I arrived...

1391
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:51,661
after barely responding
for weeks to any of my calls.

1392
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,872
I didn't decide
I didn't want to live together.

1393
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,583
I told you my mom
actually needs me.

1394
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:59,252
And that's totally okay...

1395
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:02,964
but I haven't been able
to reach you for so long.

1396
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,716
What is going on?

1397
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:07,802
Chef sighting.
Fucking chef sighting.

1398
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:10,346
- Oh, my God. Where?
- He's here. He's over there.

1399
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:11,931
- No way.
- Yeah.

1400
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:15,018
- What do I do?
- Just go over and say hi...

1401
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,187
- and, you know -
- Ask if he wants to see my video.

1402
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,189
No, he doesn't want to see
your fucking video.

1403
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:20,815
So I'm gonna go.

1404
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,735
- Frankie?
- No, I mean I'm gonna go.

1405
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:25,695
We're talking.

1406
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,907
And you can call me
when you want to.

1407
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,701
All right?
Like, if you can find a spare moment.

1408
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:39,000
God, she's such a drip!

1409
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,878
Oh!

1410
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:57,101
Hey.

1411
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,854
I did not think you'd come.

1412
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,607
Well, my day off.

1413
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,651
I didn't think you'd quit.

1414
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,403
Yeah, well, I quit.

1415
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,280
Fuckin' A, man.

1416
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,744
You want to get outta here?

1417
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,579
Yes.

1418
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,793
So your girlfriend
let you out of the house?

1419
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,045
She's working tonight...

1420
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:27,465
but, uh, it's complicated.

1421
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,926
Complicated how?

1422
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:33,054
I don't really call her
my girlfriend anymore.

1423
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,806
Since when?

1424
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:37,141
Since I fucked one of her friends
from beauty school.

1425
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:40,103
Gotcha.

1426
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,984
Kohlrabi.

1427
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,194
Kohlrabi's
a really fuckin' stupid food.

1428
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,531
Everyone's always trying to do all this
fancy shit with it, like kohlrabi mousse...

1429
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:55,118
and kohlrabi syrup,
but it's not even really fuckin' food.

1430
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:57,579
It's just ra- It's just rabbit food.

1431
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:02,166
- What?
- I just thought it was so funny...

1432
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:05,044
the way you said it, you were like,
"Kohlrabi is a really fucking stupid -"

1433
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,338
I've never even heard of kohlrabi.

1434
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:11,342
It's just so cool to me that
you have, like, a thing, you know?

1435
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,679
That's your thing.
Like, food is your thing.

1436
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,100
I think I'm really high.

1437
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:22,186
That'll happen.

1438
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,823
I shouldn't.

1439
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:38,953
- Okay.
- Listen, I'm still living with Jessica...

1440
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:42,040
and I feel like I should keep it
in my pants, you know?

1441
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,209
- Hmm.
- Just until we're formally -

1442
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:48,254
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

1443
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,395
Ow!

1444
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:10,985
Let's walk.

1445
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:52,110
- You're kneeling on my foot.
- Sorry.

1446
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:55,238
- No, I kind of like it.
- Dirty bitch.

1447
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,081
Sorry.

1448
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:16,551
Boss me around a little bit.

1449
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:19,804
Okay. S-Suck it harder.

1450
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:24,600
Oh, fuck!
Your phone keeps ringing.

1451
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,111
- You don't have AIDS, do you?
- No. Do you?

1452
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,654
Hmm-mm.

1453
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:39,115
- Do you have herpes?
- No. Do you?

1454
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,159
No.

1455
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,800
Pull my hair.

1456
01:25:55,901 --> 01:26:00,238
I hope you don't judge me too harshly
for having fucked you in a pipe.

1457
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,281
No harm, no foul.

1458
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,494
Shit! That's my boy.

1459
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,417
- What?
- Shh!

1460
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,135
It's not him.

1461
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:27,181
It was this guy who used to work
with Jessica's sister, you know?

1462
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:30,226
So you were attempting
to hide me behind this car?

1463
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,603
No harm, no foul.

1464
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,690
You said that, like,
seven times tonight.

1465
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,110
I should probably go.

1466
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:42,196
Okay.
I'm just gonna catch a cab.

1467
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:44,824
- I'll see you soon?
- See you later.

1468
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,441
Hi, Mommy.

1469
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,864
What's up?

1470
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,411
What, are you mad at me?

1471
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:33,080
What do you think?

1472
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,458
I'm home now, okay?
I'm about to take out the trash.

1473
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,627
I took it out already.

1474
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,755
What about your back?

1475
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,507
What about my back?
It really hurts.

1476
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:47,511
So you didn't have to do that.
I told you I was coming home.

1477
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:51,557
Since when do you do any of the things
you say you're gonna do lately?

1478
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,560
Okay, we've had this conversation.

1479
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,480
I don't want to have to say this
over and over. I'm figuring it out.

1480
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,565
Oh, my God.
"Mom, I'm figuring it out.

1481
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,026
Mom, I'm on it.
Mom, I'm all over it."

1482
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:05,571
I am so sick of your words.

1483
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,495
Come on.

1484
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,706
Do you like living here?

1485
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:20,962
That is such a ridiculous question.
I love living here.

1486
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,174
Well, I don't think you love it
as much as you think you do.

1487
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:39,730
Boss me around a little bit.

1488
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,592
Can I come in?

1489
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,594
Mm-hmm.

1490
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,112
Do you want me to rub
your back for a minute?

1491
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,156
Mm-hmm.

1492
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:40,416
Do you want me to tell you
where it hurts?

1493
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,960
No, I can figure it out.

1494
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,137
You know, if filmmaking
doesn't work out...

1495
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:56,140
you could always be
a massage therapist.

1496
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:59,935
You have a v-
very intuitive touch...

1497
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:02,313
kind of like my sister.

1498
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:12,573
Do you remember when I was little,
and I wanted to be a makeup artist?

1499
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,909
Mm-hmm.

1500
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:17,745
Your poor babysitters and Nadine.

1501
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,209
You said I would be something
better than a makeup artist...

1502
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:26,837
but I thought being
a makeup artist sounded fine.

1503
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:29,632
It is fine. It's all fine.

1504
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,721
No, I don't want
to be a makeup artist...

1505
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,349
and I don't want to be
a massage therapist...

1506
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,478
and I don't want to be a day hostess.

1507
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:47,483
I want to be
as successful as you are.

1508
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,527
Oh, you will be
more successful than I am.

1509
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,904
Really, believe me.

1510
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:59,120
I want to be as successful as Nadine.

1511
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:01,205
Now, that's gonna be harder.

1512
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:07,336
She's a little obnoxious
with all that, anyway.

1513
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:12,716
I read your journal
from when you were my age.

1514
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:15,761
I don't care.

1515
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:20,182
I mean, I didn't read the whole thing.
I just read part of it, but -

1516
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,060
I figured you knew where they were.

1517
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:25,771
Yeah, if you didn't want me to read it,
you shouldn't have just left it right out there...

1518
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,440
in the lightbulb cabinet
where anyone could find it.

1519
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,192
I really don't care...

1520
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,112
and I'm sure
they're not that interesting, and...

1521
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,324
frankly, I can't remember
anything I wrote.

1522
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,618
Mostly about food.

1523
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,832
- Who was Ed?
- Ed?

1524
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,834
Yeah, you wrote a lot
about someone named Ed.

1525
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,420
Oh. Ooh, Ed.

1526
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:54,091
Sheila and I rented a corner of his loft
and ended up paying most of his rent.

1527
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:58,095
- Where was it?
- On the Bowery.

1528
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,097
You lived there?

1529
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,141
We lived there, he lived there...

1530
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:06,228
and his girlfriend used to come
and paint in a corner every day.

1531
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:10,232
They had these unbelievable
screaming fights.

1532
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,610
And I'd met them both
at a meditation conference...

1533
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:15,946
so I found the whole thing very, very un-Zen,
if you know what I mean.

1534
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:17,615
Mm-hmm.

1535
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,075
Anyway, one day he came in...

1536
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:23,120
and started screaming at her.

1537
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:25,080
And he left.

1538
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:29,251
And I walked over to her corner,
and she was crying and painting...

1539
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,253
and painting while she was crying...

1540
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,422
and I said, "Excuse me.

1541
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,091
I hope you don't think
this is rude or forward...

1542
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,802
but I overheard your fight...

1543
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:40,930
and I think you were really right...

1544
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:44,308
and he was really, really wrong."

1545
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,978
And from that point on
we became best friends.

1546
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:51,941
- Who was Phil?
- Phil...

1547
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:55,402
was a guy
who didn't like sex very much.

1548
01:32:57,656 --> 01:33:00,950
- Was he your boyfriend?
- Oh, no. Not really.

1549
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,661
Seems like you had
sort of a lot of boyfriends.

1550
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,121
I didn't at all.

1551
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:09,124
I was just trying stuff out...

1552
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:11,335
probably kind of like what you're doing.

1553
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:22,888
I met up with that chef from work.

1554
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:26,642
When?

1555
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,312
Tonight.

1556
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:34,149
What happened?

1557
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:40,155
We had sex.

1558
01:33:40,282 --> 01:33:42,199
Where?

1559
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:45,661
In this house?

1560
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,705
No.

1561
01:33:48,915 --> 01:33:50,791
At his house?

1562
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,085
No, he has a girlfriend.

1563
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:56,839
- At a hotel?
- No. I wish.

1564
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:59,717
- Where?
- I don't wanna say.

1565
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:02,636
In the street?

1566
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:04,722
No, worse than that.

1567
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,807
What is worse than the street?

1568
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:11,687
A pipe in the street.

1569
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,190
Didn't you get cold?

1570
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:19,445
Not really.

1571
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:22,614
- Did you use protection?
- No.

1572
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:27,953
Aura, I really, really
want you to be careful.

1573
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,305
I'm really tired, Mom.
I just have to go to sleep.

1574
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,975
Wanna sleep with me?

1575
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:54,938
Yeah.

1576
01:34:55,065 --> 01:34:57,775
Why don't you shut off the light?

1577
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:16,210
Do you hear that ticking sound?

1578
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,633
A little bit, maybe.
I think it's the alarm clock.

1579
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:26,011
You think you could move it?

1580
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:30,265
Yeah, hold on a second.

1581
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,791
I put it away.

1582
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:59,378
I can still hear it.

1583
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:01,964
Yeah, but only a little bit, right?
