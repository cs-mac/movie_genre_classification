1
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:27,761
All right, kids! Rise and shine!
Let's go, everybody!

2
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,734
Come on, girls! Enough with the hair!

3
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:09,368
I talked to Pete Scalary last night.

4
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:12,039
He's going to get that training bra
back here real soon. Who's in here?

5
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,143
Danny saw me naked!

6
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:18,915
You think you're cool, Danny.

7
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,054
Who are you? What's your name?

8
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:22,552
Did you brush your teeth?

9
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:23,351
Both of them.

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,822
When are you going to get that haircut?

11
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:26,418
Honey, who is this?

12
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:27,963
That's your nephew!

13
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,125
What are we running, a restaurant?

14
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,429
Did you get out yesterday?

15
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:35,263
Twice. I caddied for Ty Webb
in the morning...

16
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:37,272
...and I had doubles in the afternoon.

17
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:38,366
How much is that?

18
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,966
It's about 30 bucks plus tips.

19
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,339
Well! Put it in the college fund!

20
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,712
You're like a three-year-old!

21
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:47,943
You have to tell him every time
he gets money in his pocket.

22
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:49,006
Listen, as soon as you guys get...

23
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,643
...back from Little League, let's get
some painting done on this house.

24
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:54,423
The Douglases got fake brick.
You don't have to paint it.

25
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,290
Hooray for the Douglases!
Oh, Jonathan! Bad boy!

26
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:01,159
Why don't you give the St. Copius
Scholarship people a call?

27
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,957
I don't know about that place anymore.
I talked to a guy who went there.

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,361
He said there were only two girls
and they were both nuns.

29
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,731
I saw that! That's about
10 bucks and change!

30
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,132
I had a couple of burgers
and some cokes for lunch.

31
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:13,472
How many cokes?

32
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:14,402
Four or five.

33
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,010
What are you, a diabetic?

34
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,147
You're not leaving this house
until we settle the college thing!

35
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,177
Honey, if he doesn't have
something lined up by September...

36
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:24,851
...I'm going to ask Tom Burdick
to put him on at the lumber yard!

37
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,621
He's not going to work
at the lumber yard!

38
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:29,416
Well, he isn't going to be
a caddy all his life, is he?

39
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:34,520
"I'm all right and nobody
worry about me.

40
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:40,199
"Why you got to give me a fight?
Can't you just let it be?

41
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,347
"Who do you want...

42
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,511
"...and who are you going to be today?"

43
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:54,405
Hey, Mr. Webb.
Can I ask you something?

44
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:56,301
Sure thing. Shoot, Timmy.

45
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:57,305
Danny.

46
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,745
When you were my age,
did you ever have trouble...

47
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,751
...deciding what you wanted
to do with your life?

48
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,346
No, I've never had that problem.
Why?

49
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,458
Forget it. I didn't think
you'd understand.

50
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:13,657
Do you take drugs?

51
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:14,622
Every day.

52
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:16,458
Good. So what's the problem?

53
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,062
I don't know. Did you have to take
that Cooter Preference Test...

54
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,728
...when you were a senior
in high school?

55
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,798
Oh, yes, I took it. They said
I should be a fire-watcher.

56
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:28,273
What are you supposed to be?

57
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:29,307
An underachiever.

58
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,276
I've got to go to college.
I've got to!

59
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,048
Oh, Danny, this isn't Russia.

60
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,052
Is this Russia?
This isn't Russia, is it?

61
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:41,184
I didn't think so. No, the thing is,
do you want to go to college?

62
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:45,820
In Nebraska?
Besides, it costs like $8,000 a year.

63
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:48,392
Hold on, Danny. I think I let
you have, what, $2.50 yesterday?

64
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,996
I can't foot the bill for everything
around here, so don't ask for money.

65
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,659
It's just that my dad can't afford it.

66
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,862
I haven't even told him about
the scholarship I didn't get.

67
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,735
I'll end up working in a lumber yard
the rest of my life.

68
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,401
What's wrong with lumber?
I own two lumber yards.

69
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,272
I notice you don't spend
too much time there.

70
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:02,478
I'm not sure where they are.

71
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,316
I like you, Betty.

72
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:12,684
That's Danny, sir.

73
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:15,881
Danny. I'm going to give
you a little advice.

74
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:17,920
There's a force in the universe...

75
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:19,825
...that makes things happen...

76
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,896
...and all you have to do
is get in touch with it.

77
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,297
Stop thinking. Let things happen...

78
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,874
...and be... the ball.

79
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,872
Where's the wedge?

80
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:43,848
Find your center.

81
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:47,912
Hear nothing. Feel nothing.

82
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,762
That is kind of incredible, sir.

83
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:57,225
You try it, Danny.

84
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:12,376
Just relax. Find your center.

85
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:15,376
Picture the shot. Picture it.

86
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:16,776
Turn off all the sound.

87
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:20,854
Just let it happen. Be the ball.

88
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:25,625
Be the ball, Danny. You're
not being the ball, Danny.

89
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,221
Well, it's kind of difficult
with you talking like that.

90
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,762
I'm not talking. Stop talking.

91
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:33,660
I'm not talking now.

92
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:35,567
Be the ball.

93
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:43,604
Where did it go?

94
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:48,113
Right in the lumber yard. It's okay.
We'll work on it.

95
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:18,809
Do you know what I just saw?

96
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:20,645
A gopher!

97
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,974
A gopher? Where?

98
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,283
Do you know what gophers
can do to a golf course?

99
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,556
I think they're tunneling in from
that construction site over yonder.

100
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,223
Czervik Construction Company?

101
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:34,019
I'll slap an injunction on them so
fast it will make their heads spin!

102
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,131
You get rid of those gophers...

103
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,135
...or I'll be looking for a new
greens keeper! Is that clear?

104
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:41,868
Aye, sir! Very clear, sir!

105
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,706
I'll put my best man on it!

106
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,542
I'm looking at you.
You wore green so you could hide.

107
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:58,676
I don't blame you. You're a tramp.
Oh, that was a good one!

108
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,580
That was right where you wanted it.

109
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,490
Mrs. Crane, you're a little
monkey woman, you know that?

110
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:06,054
You're a little monkey woman.
You're lean...

111
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,956
...and you're mean and you're not
too far between either...

112
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,020
...I bet, are you, huh?

113
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,660
Would you like to wrap
your spikes around my head?

114
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,097
Damn your eyes, man!

115
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,106
I told you to cut the long grass on
the 13th and mow the practice green!

116
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,501
I was unavoidably detained.

117
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:26,977
Well, you can forget about
the 13th and the practice green.

118
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:28,877
I've got a more important job for you.

119
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,886
I want you to kill every gopher
on the course!

120
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,323
Check me if I'm wrong, Sandy,
but if I kill all the golfers...

121
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:37,824
...they're going to lock me up
and throw away the key.

122
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:42,557
Gophers! Gophers!
The little brown furry rodents!

123
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:43,994
We can do that.

124
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,727
We don't even have to have a reason.

125
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:47,227
Then do it, man!

126
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:49,598
I'll just do the same thing,
but with gophers.

127
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,369
It's not my fault nobody can
understand what you're saying.

128
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,653
Give me the Mets and three and
I'll take the Yankees even.

129
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,281
I'll call you back.

130
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:12,954
Caddyshack!

131
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:21,665
All right. I'll be right up.

132
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:24,966
Take over for me.

133
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:25,900
I'll be right back.

134
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,487
So I jumped ship in Hong Kong
and made my way over to Tibet...

135
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:43,155
...and I get on as a looper at
this course over in the Himalayas.

136
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:44,320
A looper?

137
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,921
A looper. You know,
a caddy, a looper...

138
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,292
...a jock.

139
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:52,998
So I tell them I'm a pro jock and
who do you think they give me?

140
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:57,094
The Dalai Lama, himself.

141
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:58,503
The 12th son of the Lama.

142
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:04,006
The flowing robes,
the grace, bald, striking.

143
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,971
So I'm on the first tee with him.
I give him the driver.

144
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:11,577
He hauls off and whacks one.
Big hitter, the Lama. Long!

145
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,882
Into a 10,000 foot crevice right
at the base of this glacier!

146
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:17,717
Do you know what the Lama says?

147
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:24,591
Gunga-glalunga
Gunga-gunga-da-gunga.

148
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:29,095
So we finish 18 and
he's going to stiff me.

149
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:30,969
And I say, "Hey! Lama!"

150
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,999
"How about a little something,
you know, for the effort?"

151
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,710
And he says, "Oh, there
won't be any money...

152
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,481
"...but when you die
on your deathbed...

153
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:46,244
"...you will receive
total consciousness."

154
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:51,856
So I've got that going for me.
Which is nice.

155
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:55,553
Your ball is right over there.
Go straight and you can't miss it.

156
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:59,663
Mrs. Havercamp. You go
that way and it's right over...

157
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:01,902
Mrs. Havercamp. You need this.

158
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:03,402
Oh, I might, at that.

159
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,039
Mr. Havercamp, your ball
is right over here, sir.

160
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:27,057
No, Mr. Havercamp, the green
is right over there. It's that way.

161
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:30,662
Look, sir, just bend a little that way
and swing away and...

162
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,402
...just straight up. That's fine.
Great.

163
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:45,437
That's a peach, hon!

164
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:50,246
Oh, I'm hot today!

165
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,822
I can't pay you. Lou has to.

166
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,226
Where is he?

167
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:06,127
He's out.

168
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:08,565
I can see he's out, numb nuts!

169
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:10,834
Give me a coke.

170
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:20,480
Hey, wait a minute!
That's only 50 cents!

171
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,614
Lou raised the price of coke.
He's been losing at the track.

172
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,351
Well, I ain't paying no
50 cents for no coke!

173
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,594
Then you ain't getting no coke!

174
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,590
You've had it, Noonan!
Come on, open this door!

175
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:40,157
Watch it, jerk!

176
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:44,969
Come on out, Noonan!

177
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:49,811
Open up. Come on.

178
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,340
Sure you don't need me for nothing?

179
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,655
Hey, I think you and I ought to go
outside and have a little talk.

180
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:12,163
My friend, you have no idea how
happy this is going to make me.

181
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:14,368
I'm going to enjoy this thoroughly.

182
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,898
I hope that means both of us.

183
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:17,963
Couldn't we just
arm wrestle or something?

184
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:20,405
That's my brother!
Give me a hand.

185
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:23,638
Whip his ass, Tony!

186
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,404
Now, who did you say
the jerk was, jerk?

187
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:41,828
What is this?

188
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,725
What does that sign say?

189
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:46,797
No bare feet.

190
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,058
What does that sign say?

191
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:49,031
No fighting.

192
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,067
What does it mean?

193
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:50,799
No fighting.

194
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:54,831
You owe me one gumball machine!
What's that candy wrapper doing there?

195
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:57,104
Don't you see it?

196
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,239
Well, pick it up!

197
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,811
I'm going to put it right on the line.

198
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,286
There have been a lot of
complaints already.

199
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,652
Fooling around on the course.
Bad language.

200
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:10,021
Smoking grass. Poor caddying.

201
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,257
So, if you guys want to get fired...

202
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:16,363
...if you want to be replaced
by golf carts, just keep it up.

203
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:18,392
All right, one announcement.

204
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:23,032
Carl Lipbaum died last week in summer
school from a severe anxiety attack.

205
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,570
I heard he swallowed
his vomit during a test.

206
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,774
However it happened, he was
a good caddy and a good kid.

207
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:31,106
He was a brown nose, Lou!
You hated him.

208
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:35,873
Shut up! That means the caddy
scholarship is available again...

209
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:39,118
...and anyone who's interested
should go see Judge Smails.

210
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:40,849
And kiss his ass!

211
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:42,216
That would help.

212
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,283
All right! Let's move out.
We've got golfers waiting.

213
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,357
You! Angie! Pick up that blood.

214
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,125
What kind of grades do I need
for this Caddy Scholarship deal?

215
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:57,605
Well, if you've been a good caddy,
I think they're kind of lenient.

216
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,205
We're just about to tee off now.

217
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,706
So call the hospital...

218
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:03,642
...and move my appointment with
Mrs. Bellows back 30 minutes.

219
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,715
Just snake a tube down her nose
and I'll be there...

220
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:12,015
...in four or five hours.
Testing now.

221
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,528
Don't you have homes?

222
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,100
There's a brown Audi parked
in my parking space.

223
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,964
Get a tow truck over here and
have it hauled away immediately!

224
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,445
Look at the wax build-up
on those shoes!

225
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,444
This is fine leather!
I want that wax stripped off...

226
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,245
...and I want them creamed and
buffed with a fine chamois...

227
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:48,414
...and I want them now! Chop-chop!

228
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:49,555
You've got them, Judge!

229
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,526
Spaulding! Get dressed.
You're playing golf today.

230
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:54,920
No, I'm not, Grandpa!
I'm playing tennis!

231
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:56,859
You're playing golf
and you're going to like it!

232
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:57,928
What about my asthma?

233
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,224
I'll give you asthma!

234
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,199
What did you shoot today?

235
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,462
Oh, I don't keep score, Judge.

236
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,134
How do you measure yourself
with other golfers?

237
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:07,368
By height.

238
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,536
You should play with
Dr. Beeper and myself.

239
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:15,873
I mean, he's been Club champion
for three years running,

240
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:16,976
...and I'm no slouch, myself.

241
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:20,987
Don't sell yourself short, Judge.
You're a tremendous slouch.

242
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,255
Have you heard the latest one...

243
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,264
...about the Jew, the Catholic and
the colored boy who went to heaven?

244
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,198
That's a doozie, Judge!

245
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:37,367
Colored boy?

246
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:40,374
Why, you son of a bitch!
I'll fix you!

247
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:58,092
Here you are, kid. Park my car.
Get my bags.

248
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:00,228
And put on some weight, will you?

249
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,764
Hey, Wang! What's with the pictures?
It's a parking lot! Come on.

250
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,438
I think this place is restricted,
so don't tell them you're Jewish, okay?

251
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:11,697
Hey, kid, I'm Al Czervik.

252
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:14,709
I'm playing with Drew Scott today
and this is my guest, Mr. Wang.

253
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,713
Let me have half a dozen
of those Vulcan D-tens...

254
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,715
...and set my friend up
with the whole shmeer.

255
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,710
You know, clubs, bags, shoes...

256
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,649
...gloves, shirt, pants.

257
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,885
Orange balls!
I'll have a box of those...

258
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:28,946
...and give me a box of those
naked lady tees.

259
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:33,151
This is the worst-looking
hat I ever saw!

260
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,525
You buy a hat like this, I'll bet
you get a free bowl of soup, huh?

261
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,233
Oh, it looks good on you, though.

262
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:50,036
Judge Smails, Smails the Third,
Dr. Beeper and Bishop Pickering.

263
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:51,101
Who wants it, huh?

264
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,144
I'll take Smails if nobody wants him.

265
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,674
Brown nose!

266
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:00,145
Motor mouth, take Dr. Beeper.

267
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,018
John, you take the Bish.

268
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,253
Hey, this is ridiculous.
Let me carry that one.

269
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:08,159
No. I can do it.

270
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:41,594
Madonna with meatballs!

271
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:49,696
Turds!

272
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,901
Spaulding! How many times have I
spoken to you about your language?

273
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,472
Sorry, Grandpa. I forgot.

274
00:19:57,913 --> 00:20:01,178
Bishop Pickering, Dr. Beeper,
this is my niece, Lacey Underall.

275
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,043
Lacey's mother sent her
to us for the summer.

276
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,220
It must be a nice change
from dreary old Manhattan.

277
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:10,487
Yes. I was getting really tired
of having fun all the time.

278
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:14,994
Double turds!

279
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:18,129
Hey, where do we tee off?

280
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,097
Hey, we're all set to go.
You know my friend here, don't you?

281
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:27,401
Are we waiting for these guys?

282
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:29,933
Hey, Whitey! Where's your hat?

283
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,425
Let's go while we're young!

284
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,460
Do you mind, sir?
I'm trying to tee off.

285
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,426
I bet you slice it into the woods.
A hundred bucks!

286
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,972
Gambling is illegal at Bushwood,
sir, and I never slice!

287
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:04,071
Damn!

288
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:05,572
Okay! You can owe me!

289
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:06,980
I owe you nothing!

290
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,616
Judge Smails, sir, can I talk to you?

291
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,451
You want your driver?

292
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:15,747
No, he's not my type.

293
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,393
Hey, that's a joke! I'm kidding.
Give me the driver.

294
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:24,123
All right, place your bets!
Here we are!

295
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:30,969
Don't count that!
I was interfered with.

296
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:36,403
By the way, what did Mr. Webb
shoot this morning?

297
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:37,976
Oh, he doesn't keep score, sir.

298
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,646
I know, but just guess.
Eighty? Seventy-five?

299
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,211
More like 68, I think.

300
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:44,813
I don't believe it.

301
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,115
Why don't you improve
your lie a little, sir?

302
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,524
Yes, Yes. Winter rules.

303
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:00,661
Fore!

304
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:01,962
Fine shot.

305
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:08,536
I should have yelled two!

306
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:11,270
Why don't we walk this off, sir?

307
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:15,442
What have you got in here, rocks?

308
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:17,775
Are you kidding?
When I was your age,

309
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,447
I would lug 50 pounds of ice
up five, six flights of stairs!

310
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:24,151
So what?

311
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:26,793
So let's dance!

312
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:35,658
Now, what the devil!

313
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:41,867
The man is a menace!

314
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,206
Cut that off!

315
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:53,277
Music is a violation of our personal
privacy! He is breaking the law!

316
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:57,488
I've always been fascinated
with the law, sir.

317
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,851
Really? What areas?

318
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:01,823
Oh, all areas.
Personal privacy, noise statutes.

319
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:05,033
I planned to go to law school
after I graduated, but...

320
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,428
...it looks like my folks
won't have enough money...

321
00:23:07,502 --> 00:23:08,434
...to put me through college.

322
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:10,805
Well, the world needs
ditch diggers, too.

323
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:13,735
Nice try.

324
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:24,846
Great big gobs of greasy
grimy gopher guts.

325
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:27,514
How about a nice,
cool drink, varmints?

326
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:31,881
Scum, slime.
Menace to the golfing industry!

327
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:34,554
You know you're a disgrace.
You're varmints.

328
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:36,856
You're one of the lowest members
of the food chain...

329
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,923
...and you'll probably
be replaced by the rat.

330
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,964
Well, I have been pushed.

331
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,099
I think it's about time somebody
teaches these varmints...

332
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,767
...a little lesson about morality...

333
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:53,472
...and about what it's like to be a
decent upstanding member of a society!

334
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:57,144
Come to Carl, varmint.

335
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:04,624
Okay! I guess we're
playing for keeps now.

336
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:07,452
I guess the kidding around
is pretty much over, huh?

337
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:09,088
I guess it's just a matter now of...

338
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:10,093
...pumping about 15,000...

339
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:11,765
...gallons of water down there...

340
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:14,363
...to teach you a little bit
of a lesson.

341
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:16,267
Is that it? I think it is!

342
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,077
Say, you guys are brothers, huh?

343
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,586
Is this a family business, or what?

344
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:36,282
They say for Italians this is
skilled labor, you know that?

345
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,789
No, actually, I'm a rich millionaire.

346
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:40,391
You see, my doctor
told me to get out...

347
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,396
...and carry golf bags
a couple of times a week.

348
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:46,791
Oh, you're a funny kid. What time
are you due back in Boys Town?

349
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:52,504
Albert Einstein gave me this.

350
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:55,204
Nice man.

351
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,279
He made a fortune in physics.

352
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,977
I'll tell you, son.
My main satisfaction...

353
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:09,988
...is working with young people like
yourself at our new Lutheran Center.

354
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:12,215
Why don't you drop by some time?

355
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:14,728
I've often thought of
entering the priesthood.

356
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:17,521
Oh, are you Roman Catholic?

357
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,534
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you can't come.

358
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,538
Go for it.

359
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,707
You know, I've often thought
of becoming a golf club.

360
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:34,547
Not bad, huh? And I'll have 2,000
more units in the next two years!

361
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:37,549
I bet they'd love a great
shopping mall right here!

362
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:40,013
Condos over there! Plenty of parking.

363
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:42,049
I tell you, country clubs
and cemeteries...

364
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,057
...are the biggest wasters
of prime real estate!

365
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:48,519
Dead people? They don't want to be
buried nowadays. Ecology, right?

366
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:51,323
Ask Wang. He'll tell you.
We just bought property...

367
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:53,333
...behind the Great Wall.
On the good side!

368
00:25:58,073 --> 00:25:59,040
I want a hamburger.

369
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,737
No, a cheeseburger.

370
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,100
I want a hot dog.

371
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:04,006
I want a milkshake.

372
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:07,172
You'll get nothing and like it!

373
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,380
Stop it. The judge will see you.

374
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,090
Are you going out with
me tonight, Maggie?

375
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:22,254
Yes. To my room? I've got to work
in the dining room tonight.

376
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:24,293
Come work with me.
You can bus tables.

377
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,258
I've never done that.

378
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,560
It's easy. You fill the water glass,
replace the butter.

379
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:31,266
If they drop a fork,
you give them another one.

380
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:32,631
I don't think I can handle that.

381
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:39,077
Put me down for five.

382
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:45,314
If I can just make this one.

383
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:58,389
A thousand bucks you miss that putt!

384
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:00,595
Of all the nerve!

385
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,419
I did not throw it. It...

386
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,495
Well, if you didn't,
how the hell did it get here?

387
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:32,494
It slipped!

388
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:34,363
What seems to be the problem?

389
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:36,159
He almost killed my wife
with his damn club!

390
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:39,065
It was an accident!
It slipped out of my hands.

391
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:40,467
I noticed your grips were worn, sir.

392
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:41,907
I should have mentioned it
to you before.

393
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,205
I could put some "stick-um"
on there for you. It's my fault.

394
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:48,445
It's a good idea.
Next time be more careful!

395
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:53,848
Kids! Look, I'm terribly
sorry this happened.

396
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:58,114
I'll pay for your lunch and I'll,
uh, pay for the umbrella.

397
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:02,595
I'll see you at the table.
I'll sign your card.

398
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:15,273
Thanks for helping me back there.
You're a good caddy.

399
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,969
Something to be very proud of.

400
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:21,978
Do you know we're giving another
caddy scholarship this year?

401
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:25,914
I heard something about that, sir,
but my grades in high school...

402
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,285
...weren't actually
all that outstanding.

403
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:29,255
There are more important
things than grades.

404
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:31,921
Winning the caddy tournament,
for instance.

405
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,355
It might look pretty good on
a young fellow's application.

406
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:36,660
I'm sure going to try, sir.

407
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:40,425
This is for you. Tell Ty Webb
I'm gunning for him.

408
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:43,226
If he's as good as he says he is,
he's got to play me to prove it!

409
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:44,766
I will, sir.

410
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:06,251
License to kill gophers by the
government of the United Nations.

411
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:09,258
Man... free to kill gophers at will.

412
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:12,025
To kill, you must know your enemy.

413
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,964
In this case, my enemy is a varmint,
and a varmint will never quit.

414
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:21,898
Ever! They're like the Viet Cong.
Varmint Cong!

415
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,107
So what you have to do,
you have to fall back...

416
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:27,441
...on superior firepower...

417
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:31,183
...and superior intelligence.

418
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:34,944
And that's all she wrote.

419
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:00,205
Are you going to eat your fat?

420
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:04,485
You're looking lovely
this evening, Mrs. Smails.

421
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:11,519
You'd be interested to know
this uniform was given me...

422
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:13,720
...by the Captain of the Links
at St. Andrews from Scotland.

423
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:16,524
They invented the game there,
except they call it "gof"...

424
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:17,530
...without the "L" as we do.

425
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,326
I think I have enough butter now.

426
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:22,034
Right. If you need any more...

427
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,940
So when Mona died last winter,
I said to myself,

428
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:30,972
"Al, if you keep busting your hump
16, 20 hours a day...

429
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,570
"...you'll end up with
a $60-million funeral!"

430
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:37,679
Hey, doll, could you scare up
another round for our table?

431
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:40,716
And tell the cook this is
low-grade dog food.

432
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,050
Here, take this for yourself.

433
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,285
Gee, I had better food at the ballgame!

434
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:48,655
I tell you, this steak still has marks
where the jockey was hitting it.

435
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,024
Well, anyway, today I just
stick to real estate.

436
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:55,792
With the market these days,
if you own anything but land...

437
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,802
...you own a popcorn farm!

438
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,634
Oh, did somebody
step on a duck?

439
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,747
Ain't that right, sir?

440
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:12,786
Oh, the graveyard is two blocks
to the left, okay?

441
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:18,053
Dog food? I'll show him dog food!

442
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:24,186
Hey, where's the bar?
Let's have some drinks here.

443
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:28,668
Hey, waiter, here. This is for you,
all right? Oh! Captain Hook!

444
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:30,795
Oh, how about the grand
you owe me, huh?

445
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:32,806
Aw, forget about it.
I'm just kidding.

446
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:35,700
This is your wife, huh?
Oh, a lovely lady.

447
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:36,933
Hey, baby, you're all right.

448
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:38,945
You must have been something
before electricity, huh?

449
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:43,083
Hey, doll, how are you, huh?
You live alone?

450
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:47,415
Hey, Rabbi, nice seeing you.
Folks how are you?

451
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,757
And this is your grandson, huh?
Oh, wonderful boy!

452
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,757
Yeah, he's a good boy.

453
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,255
Now I know why
tigers eat their young.

454
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,757
The dance of the living dead!

455
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:03,068
I know why you came here tonight.

456
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,032
Why?

457
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:06,969
That girl. Listen, I'd put that
idea right out of your mind.

458
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,371
She's been plucked more times
than the rose of Tralee.

459
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:12,379
Biggest whore on Fifth Avenue,
I'm told!

460
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:36,926
Pay no attention to that bush
moving around there by that tree.

461
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,696
It's just a bush. Don't even
look twice at it.

462
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:41,435
Nothing to be alarmed about.

463
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,441
This looks like it could be gravy.

464
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:06,827
I smell varmint poontang,
and the only good...

465
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:11,699
...varmint poontang is dead
varmint poontang... I think.

466
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,989
Ty, there's someone you must meet!

467
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,224
Al built our condo in Palm Beach.

468
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:42,435
I need a drink. Nice meeting you.

469
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:48,342
I think someone is
giving you the big eye!

470
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,584
Hey! Can you make a bullshot?

471
00:33:58,953 --> 00:33:59,885
Can you make a shoe smell?

472
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:03,521
Very funny. Why don't you get yourself
a real haircut? Here, take this.

473
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,550
What people here! Look at that one.

474
00:34:07,061 --> 00:34:09,552
The last time I saw a mouth
like that, it had a hook in it!

475
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,496
So what brings you to this nape
of the woods... neck of the wape?

476
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:20,933
How come you're here?

477
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:23,038
Daddy wanted to broaden me.

478
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:25,841
In this place? Good luck!

479
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,676
What do you do for excitement?

480
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,611
Oh, I, uh... play a lot of golf.

481
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:37,383
Golf? Nixon plays golf.

482
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:40,124
I'll bet you've got a lot of
interesting stories...

483
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:41,525
...about your ball landing in the road.

484
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:44,792
So what do you do?

485
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:49,426
I enjoy... skinny-skiing...

486
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,572
...going to bullfights on acid...

487
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,708
I'll bet you've got a lot of nice ties.

488
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:04,777
What do you mean?

489
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:10,080
You want to tie me up
with some of your ties... Ty?

490
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:13,825
I've got a good idea.

491
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:19,157
Let's pretend...
we're real human beings.

492
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,467
Freeze, gopher!

493
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:06,310
Who is that disgusting man over there?

494
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:09,007
I tell you, I never saw
dead people smoke before!

495
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,142
A guest of the Scotts.

496
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:15,354
What do you say we
bust up this joint, huh?

497
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,685
Hey, you two should
get a room, you know?

498
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:20,988
Hey, Ringo, play something hot,
will you?

499
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:24,293
And you guys... take some more lessons!

500
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:35,373
Hey, Judge, give someone else
a chance! You lucky devil!

501
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:39,168
Come here, honey! And hey, loosen up!
You're a lot of woman, you know?

502
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:42,044
You want to make $14 the hard way?

503
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:46,050
You! You! You're no gentleman!

504
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,047
I'm no doorknob, either.

505
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:50,421
I never want to see
that man here again!

506
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:20,145
Wait up, girls.
I've got a salami I've got to hide.

507
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:24,550
I told you! Today is the day
we change the holes!

508
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,220
Go do it now! No more slacking off!

509
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:30,527
I'll slack you off,
you fuzzy little foreigner...

510
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,760
...and I'll fill your bagpipes
with Wheatena!

511
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:38,929
Man in a boat overboard.

512
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:41,969
You beast!

513
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,468
You savage.

514
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:45,672
Come on, bark like a dog for me.

515
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:50,543
Bark like a dog! I will teach you
the meaning of the word "respect"!

516
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,059
I've just got to win
that caddy tournament!

517
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:03,087
I owe it to my folks
to get that scholarship.

518
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:04,491
What do you want to go to college for?

519
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:05,758
I don't know.

520
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:07,890
Let me tell you a little story.

521
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:11,465
I once knew a guy who could have been
a great golfer. Could have gone pro.

522
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:13,831
All he needed was a little
time and some practice.

523
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,132
He decided to go to college instead.

524
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:19,411
He went for four years.
Did pretty well.

525
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:23,874
At the end of his four years,
the last semester, he was kicked out.

526
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:24,940
You know what for?

527
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:29,980
He was night-putting.
Just putting at night...

528
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:31,825
...with the 15-year-old
daughter of the Dean.

529
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:37,788
You know who that guy was?

530
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:41,332
Take one good guess.

531
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:42,731
Bob Hope.

532
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:48,671
No, that guy was Mitch Cumstein,

533
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,206
...my roommate.

534
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:54,111
He's a good guy. Don't be obsessed
with your desires, Danny.

535
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:57,948
The Zen philosopher,
Basho, once wrote...

536
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:02,516
..."a flute with no holes
is not a flute...

537
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,683
"...and a doughnut with
no hole is a Danish."

538
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:07,153
He was a funny guy.

539
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:24,769
You missed just that one.

540
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,547
In one physical model of the universe,
the shortest distance...

541
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,549
...between two points
is a straight line...

542
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:31,780
...in the opposite direction.

543
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:34,818
Unbelievable!

544
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:35,848
Thank you very little.

545
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:08,718
Nice form.

546
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:09,583
Good luck, sucker.

547
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,854
No, no! Nice shot!
Right on the beach.

548
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:57,795
Okay, Danny, this is for the Gold.

549
00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:03,870
You ain't got it today, Noonan.

550
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,164
Excellent round, son!

551
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:42,680
I'm having a little party
at the Yacht Club this Sunday.

552
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,342
I'm christening my new sloop.

553
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:46,817
- What are you doing this Sunday?
- I...

554
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:47,876
- No plans.
- Great!

555
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,120
How would you like to mow my lawn?

556
00:41:50,824 --> 00:41:54,123
I figured a college-bound fellow
could use a few extra dollars, huh?

557
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:57,220
And... when you're finished...

558
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,832
...why don't you drop
by the Yacht Club?

559
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,840
How about we go swimming?

560
00:42:14,848 --> 00:42:17,373
I don't have the swimwear.
Besides, I've never swum.

561
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:18,711
I'll teach you.

562
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,152
Why don't you come on in and help me
sort my holy cards first?

563
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:31,823
Now... Maggie's pants.

564
00:43:38,332 --> 00:43:40,459
Hey, Bigfoot, don't trip in the water!

565
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:42,267
That's it!

566
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:00,480
You put your suit on!

567
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:02,152
You shave your ass!

568
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:24,776
Hi, Maggie. How was it?

569
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:26,209
How was what?

570
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:30,344
I guess it couldn't have
been that great, then.

571
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:33,343
A lot you fucking know, D'Annunzio!

572
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,021
All right. Stand up!

573
00:44:37,157 --> 00:44:39,387
All right! Okay!

574
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,595
She's incredible!

575
00:45:39,753 --> 00:45:40,549
Hi, Mama.

576
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:26,726
Hey, you guys, cool it!

577
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:30,596
I mean it now!

578
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:44,011
Want some?

579
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:44,943
Give me some.

580
00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:46,078
Who asked you?

581
00:46:46,353 --> 00:46:47,149
Come on! I'm asking.

582
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,750
Hey, thanks a lot!

583
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:18,682
Stop that, you two! All of you!

584
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:21,479
I want you out of that pool at once!

585
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,623
I don't want to see another
caddy body in this pool!

586
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,527
Did you understand what I said?
Out!

587
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:32,495
Take your hands off her, young man!

588
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:34,297
And put your clothes back on, my dear!

589
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:36,164
Out! I said, out! Didn't you hear me?

590
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,029
Doodie!

591
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:43,872
Don't touch it!

592
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:57,687
Spaulding! No!

593
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:02,886
Doodie!

594
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:13,800
If you find anything that
doesn't look like it...

595
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:18,436
I want the entire pool scrubbed,
sterilized and disinfected!

596
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:28,815
There it is!

597
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,590
It's no big deal!

598
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,390
Well, hello! Surprise, surprise!

599
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:14,297
Go ahead. It's nothing.

600
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:17,162
I tried calling, but they don't have
a listing for Mr. Wonderful.

601
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:18,798
What spelling did you use?

602
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,571
Sorry about this mess.
Let me just clean up here.

603
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:24,441
I'm getting ready for the season.

604
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:25,740
Duck?

605
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,669
No, no. Dolphin.

606
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:31,280
Would you like a drink?
Tuna Colada, perhaps?

607
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:34,746
Anything. Who's your decorator?
Benihana?

608
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:38,453
No, I brought most of that stuff
back from Vietnam.

609
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:40,126
You were in the war?

610
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:45,287
Uh... no... Homo.

611
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:48,631
Much better now, though.

612
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,340
Here's an uncashed check for $70,000.

613
00:49:56,643 --> 00:49:57,302
Keep it.

614
00:49:58,178 --> 00:50:01,409
There's a bunch of them!
And a summons.

615
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:03,608
It's yours.

616
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:06,415
Pretty pathetic, Ty.

617
00:50:07,854 --> 00:50:10,789
Pathetic? Maybe for you, Lacey.

618
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,360
For me, there's a subtle perfection
in everything I do.

619
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:16,629
I've got my own standards, my own way.

620
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,720
My uncle says you've got a screw loose.

621
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:21,094
Your uncle molests collies.

622
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:23,536
And you're rather...

623
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:25,637
...attractive for a...

624
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:30,138
...beautiful girl with a great body.

625
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:53,563
Sing me a love song.

626
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:55,026
I'm going to.

627
00:50:57,838 --> 00:50:58,497
This stuff is terrible.

628
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:00,036
It's good. You don't know
how to do it.

629
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:01,537
How do I do it?

630
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:02,469
I'm going to show you.

631
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:10,277
"I was born to love you.

632
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,578
"I was born to lick your face.

633
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:16,881
"I was born to rub you...

634
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,186
"...but you were born to rub me first."

635
00:51:20,393 --> 00:51:22,384
Let's go into the... patio.

636
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:36,439
You know what this is called
in the East?

637
00:51:37,544 --> 00:51:38,306
It's the big rub.

638
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:43,114
You're very... small-breasted.

639
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:44,612
No, I was kidding.

640
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:46,283
I'll work my way down.

641
00:51:46,753 --> 00:51:47,913
This is the Isle of Wight.

642
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:51,789
Careful. I'm going to move
right down the Ticonic Parkway...

643
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:54,124
...over to your clavula...

644
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:55,823
Will you get serious?

645
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:57,655
That's a very "in" thing to say.

646
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:02,162
Ow! That hurts!

647
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:03,333
You're blocking!

648
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:06,635
Just hold on to your choppers.

649
00:52:07,574 --> 00:52:08,632
Just a little more oil.

650
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:15,814
Now I've done it. You get that way
when you... Oh, I'm sorry.

651
00:52:16,082 --> 00:52:17,481
It's like reaching
under the rug, isn't it?

652
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:18,616
You're crazy!

653
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:21,251
That's what they said about Son of Sam.
You know something else?

654
00:52:21,988 --> 00:52:24,616
I'm a very qualified... acupuncturist.

655
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:25,951
Don't even think about it!

656
00:52:26,092 --> 00:52:27,218
I'm just going to eat these,

657
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:30,296
...but I want you to know about it.
It's like acupressure...

658
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:31,352
...but it's acupuncture.

659
00:52:31,965 --> 00:52:34,957
The slightest prick and
you wouldn't even know...

660
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:36,098
I'll kill you!

661
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:37,268
No, I did not do that.

662
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,936
You feel looser?

663
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:43,298
I feel like a 100 dollars.

664
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,112
Will you forget... the massage...

665
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,982
...and just kiss me, you fool.

666
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:22,912
Hey, what kind of shit is this?

667
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:25,913
It's the best, man.
I got it from a Negro.

668
00:53:26,853 --> 00:53:29,344
You're probably so high already
you don't even know it.

669
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:37,329
He looks like Dick Cavett.

670
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:48,000
Hey, save me a toke!

671
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:50,635
Got to do my "doctor" thing.

672
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:58,283
All right, everybody.
It's time to christen the sloop!

673
00:53:59,419 --> 00:54:03,185
Come along, children. You can
shake your booties down on the dock.

674
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:12,425
Ahoy, polloi. What did you
just come from, a Scotch ad?

675
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:14,097
Eat it, Spaulding!

676
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:18,296
My, what a nice looking young man!
You're from Bushwood, aren't you?

677
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:21,897
He's not a member, Grandma.
He's a caddy!

678
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,675
Judge Smails invited me at the club.

679
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,606
Of course. You're the young man
who wants to be in the Senate.

680
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:30,208
Well, you two look like
a couple of boogies.

681
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:32,408
Why don't you just scamper along now?

682
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,585
May I escort you out, ma'am?

683
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:38,180
Hold on, son. Are you trying
to make time with my best girl?

684
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:42,686
I want you to meet Chuck Schick.
He's clerking for me this summer...

685
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:44,093
...until he passes the bar.

686
00:54:45,465 --> 00:54:46,727
See you on deck, Senator!

687
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,103
I'm going to law school, too.

688
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:55,404
Really? Are you going to Harvard?

689
00:54:55,775 --> 00:54:57,902
No. St. Copius of, uh, Northern...

690
00:54:58,311 --> 00:54:58,970
Where?

691
00:55:00,146 --> 00:55:02,637
Hey, Cary Grant. You want to get high?

692
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:04,712
Wait a minute. I've only got a little.

693
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:06,809
Then split. Okay?

694
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,095
Guess I'm a little overdressed, huh?

695
00:55:19,132 --> 00:55:20,429
Depends on what's underneath.

696
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:28,799
I have a little poem I'd like to read
in honor of this occasion, if I may.

697
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:30,469
Spaulding, get your foot off the boat!

698
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:36,137
"It's easy to grin when
your ship comes in...

699
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,184
"...and you've got the
stock market beat...

700
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:44,485
"...but the man worthwhile
is the man who can smile...

701
00:55:45,392 --> 00:55:47,257
"...when his shorts are
too tight in the seat!"

702
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:53,197
Okay, Pookie, do the honors.

703
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:56,763
Bless this ship
and all who sail on her.

704
00:55:57,637 --> 00:56:00,868
I christen thee "The Flying Wasp."

705
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:06,171
This is your fate line.

706
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:10,208
Looks like you're going to make
a lot of money when you're older.

707
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,840
Oh, yeah? When? How?

708
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,550
Could be in the market...
or on a game show.

709
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:23,089
And this is your saliva line.

710
00:56:23,363 --> 00:56:24,022
What does it tell?

711
00:56:25,165 --> 00:56:26,393
How hot I can get you.

712
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:33,706
Well, don't just stand there!
Go get some glue!

713
00:56:34,007 --> 00:56:35,497
Hey! My buddy!

714
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:39,539
Full steam ahead! Over there.
I want to go over there!

715
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,241
Move over Swanson. I'm driving!

716
00:56:49,355 --> 00:56:50,947
My dinghy is bigger
than your whole boat!

717
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,451
Save me a parking place!

718
00:57:02,735 --> 00:57:03,394
Heave off!

719
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,532
Get back, you idiot!

720
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,245
I almost got head from Amelia Earhart!

721
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,056
What is this? Hell's Angels?

722
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:48,509
All right! Reverse!

723
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:13,097
Back!

724
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:15,774
Which way is backwards?

725
00:58:18,111 --> 00:58:19,043
Stop! Stop!

726
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:23,175
Okay. Drop anchor!

727
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:31,823
Hey, you scratched my anchor!

728
00:59:14,567 --> 00:59:17,900
I just want you to know
that because of this...

729
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:20,465
...you don't have to stop
seeing other people.

730
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,632
You!

731
00:59:55,908 --> 00:59:56,932
Your robe, Your Honor.

732
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,777
I don't believe anybody's home.

733
01:00:14,927 --> 01:00:15,586
Thanks a lot!

734
01:00:20,633 --> 01:00:22,066
Are we still having tea?

735
01:00:29,575 --> 01:00:31,566
Will you come and loofah
my stretch marks?

736
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:54,664
That must be the tea.

737
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:03,168
What an incredible Cinderella story!

738
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,574
This unknown comes out of nowhere
to lead the pack.

739
01:01:06,846 --> 01:01:09,110
He's on his final hole.

740
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:15,110
He's about 455 yards away. He's going
to hit about a two iron, I think.

741
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:23,592
Well, he got out of that.
The crowd is standing on its feet.

742
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:25,590
The normally reserved crowd...

743
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:27,521
...is going wild!

744
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:34,531
For this young Cinderella
who has come out of nowhere,

745
01:01:34,841 --> 01:01:37,503
...he's got about 350 yards left.
He's going to get about a 500...

746
01:01:37,577 --> 01:01:39,511
...I would expect. Don't you think?

747
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,416
He's got a beautiful back swing.
That's... oh! He got out of that one!

748
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:49,647
He's got to be pleased with that.
The crowd is on its feet here.

749
01:01:50,256 --> 01:01:51,917
He's a Cinderella boy.

750
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:55,618
Tears in his eyes, I guess,
as he lines up this last shot.

751
01:01:55,862 --> 01:01:58,660
He's got about 195 yards left, and...

752
01:01:59,065 --> 01:02:00,362
...looks like he's got about an 89.

753
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:05,204
This crowd is going deadly silent.
Cinderella story. Out of nowhere.

754
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:09,405
A former greens keeper now about
to become the Master's champion.

755
01:02:12,578 --> 01:02:14,409
It's in the hole!

756
01:02:17,283 --> 01:02:20,684
I was hoping to squeeze in
nine holes before this rain starts.

757
01:02:22,522 --> 01:02:23,420
Certainly, Your Eminency.

758
01:02:24,023 --> 01:02:25,012
Take my bag, huh?

759
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:46,741
You better put this on.

760
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:48,302
That's a great shot.

761
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:53,045
I can't believe the way you hit
the ball, sir. You really covered it.

762
01:02:53,953 --> 01:02:54,783
We better start moving.

763
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,695
Did you see that?

764
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:07,122
Miracle, eh?

765
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,062
Nice shot, Bishop. You must
have made a deal with the devil!

766
01:03:11,304 --> 01:03:14,501
I could break the club record.

767
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:16,434
You better come in
until this blows over.

768
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:26,309
So what do you think?

769
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,552
I'd keep playing. I don't think
the heavy stuff is going...

770
01:03:29,655 --> 01:03:30,986
...to come down for quite a while.

771
01:03:31,123 --> 01:03:31,782
You're right.

772
01:03:32,425 --> 01:03:35,917
Anyway, the good Lord
would never disrupt the...

773
01:03:36,262 --> 01:03:38,093
...best game of my life.

774
01:03:46,372 --> 01:03:48,533
I'm infallible, young fellow!

775
01:03:55,882 --> 01:03:57,440
Come on! One more hole!

776
01:04:12,565 --> 01:04:13,554
Ratfarts!

777
01:04:51,398 --> 01:04:52,296
You're here early.

778
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,103
I kind of slept here last night.

779
01:05:05,879 --> 01:05:07,244
I'm in big trouble.

780
01:05:07,814 --> 01:05:11,181
Yeah... me too. I'm late!

781
01:05:13,019 --> 01:05:13,713
Late for what?

782
01:05:14,621 --> 01:05:16,179
For not being pregnant!

783
01:05:20,727 --> 01:05:22,319
I don't hold you responsible!

784
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:27,123
It's my problem. I can handle it.

785
01:05:34,374 --> 01:05:36,137
I'm not going to let you
go through this alone!

786
01:05:37,277 --> 01:05:38,266
Whatever you decide.

787
01:05:38,645 --> 01:05:40,909
I'm going to have it!
I've already decided!

788
01:05:45,218 --> 01:05:46,150
That's it, then.

789
01:05:48,622 --> 01:05:49,714
We'll just get married.

790
01:05:50,056 --> 01:05:52,786
Oh, God! That's all I need!

791
01:05:53,994 --> 01:05:55,291
No, look, I want to, all right?

792
01:05:55,562 --> 01:05:56,927
No, you don't!

793
01:05:57,564 --> 01:05:58,292
Yes, I do!

794
01:06:01,268 --> 01:06:03,862
Look, I don't want to get married!

795
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:06,095
Come on, Maggie.
You're just saying that.

796
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:07,404
No, I'm not!

797
01:06:09,609 --> 01:06:11,406
It might not be yours. Okay?

798
01:06:14,648 --> 01:06:16,741
I know you're just making
this up about the other guys...

799
01:06:16,817 --> 01:06:17,806
...so I won't have to feel guilty.

800
01:06:18,118 --> 01:06:19,415
I'm not making it up!

801
01:06:19,653 --> 01:06:21,621
All right. Well, I'm still
willing to marry you!

802
01:06:23,023 --> 01:06:24,581
Well, thanks for nothing!

803
01:06:31,131 --> 01:06:34,623
You're a good egg, Noonan.
She needs you.

804
01:06:40,774 --> 01:06:42,674
The judge would like to see a caddy
named Danny Noonan...

805
01:06:42,742 --> 01:06:43,674
...soon as he comes in.

806
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:46,509
I'm Danny Noonan.

807
01:06:47,013 --> 01:06:47,911
Would you come with me, please?

808
01:07:00,026 --> 01:07:00,958
Judge Smails, sir?

809
01:07:01,494 --> 01:07:02,358
Sit down, Danny.

810
01:07:10,237 --> 01:07:13,297
I think you know why you're here.

811
01:07:13,573 --> 01:07:14,733
So I'll give us both the courtesy
of not reviewing...

812
01:07:14,808 --> 01:07:15,797
...what happened yesterday.

813
01:07:19,546 --> 01:07:23,539
My niece is the kind of girl that
has a certain... zest for living.

814
01:07:24,351 --> 01:07:26,046
The last thing any of us
need right now...

815
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:28,053
...is a lot of loose talk
about her behavior.

816
01:07:28,355 --> 01:07:30,516
I swear I didn't tell
anybody anything, sir.

817
01:07:32,192 --> 01:07:34,319
Good. Good.

818
01:07:35,495 --> 01:07:37,258
You know, despite what happened...

819
01:07:37,731 --> 01:07:40,199
...I'm still convinced that you have
very fine qualities, and...

820
01:07:41,368 --> 01:07:43,359
...I think you can still become
a gentleman some day.

821
01:07:44,404 --> 01:07:48,773
If... you understand and abide
by the rules of decent society.

822
01:07:54,114 --> 01:07:58,517
There's a lot of... well,
badness in the world today.

823
01:07:58,752 --> 01:08:00,242
I see it in court every day.

824
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:03,521
I've sentenced boys younger
than you to the gas chamber.

825
01:08:04,124 --> 01:08:07,560
I didn't want to do it.
I felt I owed it to them.

826
01:08:11,298 --> 01:08:15,758
The most important decision you can
make right now is where you stand.

827
01:08:18,204 --> 01:08:18,863
Goodness...

828
01:08:20,273 --> 01:08:21,365
...or badness.

829
01:08:23,443 --> 01:08:26,935
I know I've made some mistakes in the
past. I'm willing to make up for that.

830
01:08:29,115 --> 01:08:30,013
I want to be good!

831
01:08:33,019 --> 01:08:34,043
Very good!

832
01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:41,149
I know how hard it is for young
people today and I want to help.

833
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:45,896
Why, just ask my grandson, Spaulding.
He and I are regular pals.

834
01:08:48,668 --> 01:08:49,430
Are you my pal?

835
01:08:50,804 --> 01:08:52,169
Mister Scholarship Winner?

836
01:08:59,446 --> 01:09:01,607
Yes, sir! I'm your pal!

837
01:09:03,984 --> 01:09:04,746
How about a Fresca?

838
01:09:16,563 --> 01:09:17,689
Another Rob Roy, Bishop?

839
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:21,597
You never ask a navy man
if he'll have another drink...

840
01:09:22,302 --> 01:09:24,270
...because it's nobody's
goddamn business...

841
01:09:24,337 --> 01:09:26,271
...how many drinks
he's had already, right?

842
01:09:26,506 --> 01:09:29,839
Wrong! You're drinking
too much, Your Excellency.

843
01:09:30,176 --> 01:09:32,337
Excellency... fiddlesticks!

844
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:36,005
My name is Fred and I'm just
a man, same as you are.

845
01:09:36,316 --> 01:09:38,614
You're not a man.
You're a Bishop, for God's sake!

846
01:09:39,486 --> 01:09:40,783
There is no God!

847
01:09:41,354 --> 01:09:45,688
Oh, Webb, I didn't see your name on the
sign-in sheet for the Club tournament.

848
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:48,021
I thought you'd be
the man to beat this year.

849
01:09:48,862 --> 01:09:50,454
Guess you'll just have to
keep beating yourself.

850
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:57,394
Come on, honey. Let's go, huh?
How are you, boys?

851
01:09:59,406 --> 01:10:01,033
Hey, we're both starving.
When do we eat?

852
01:10:04,744 --> 01:10:07,679
You have worn out your welcome, sir!

853
01:10:07,914 --> 01:10:10,144
Is that so? Who made you
Pope of this dump?

854
01:10:10,683 --> 01:10:12,207
Bushwood... a dump?!

855
01:10:12,685 --> 01:10:15,813
Well, I'll guarantee you'll
never be a member here!

856
01:10:16,189 --> 01:10:19,750
Are you kidding? You think
I'd join this crummy snobatorium?

857
01:10:20,026 --> 01:10:21,254
Why, this whole place sucks!

858
01:10:22,896 --> 01:10:25,524
That's right. The only reason
I'm here is maybe I'll buy it!

859
01:10:25,832 --> 01:10:27,527
Buy Bushwood! You...?!

860
01:10:33,873 --> 01:10:34,897
I get no respect from anyone!

861
01:10:35,175 --> 01:10:36,107
Please! What's going on?

862
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,775
He tried to choke me! You saw it.

863
01:10:39,145 --> 01:10:41,045
And he called me a baboon.
Thinks I'm his wife.

864
01:10:41,281 --> 01:10:42,407
I'm calling the police!

865
01:10:42,682 --> 01:10:44,343
You can call the chief of police!
I built his condo!

866
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:46,248
Out! I want him out of here!

867
01:10:46,519 --> 01:10:47,247
Let's go, Beeper!

868
01:10:51,257 --> 01:10:53,452
Judge! Come on, let's be adults here!

869
01:10:53,893 --> 01:10:55,861
Let's not mess the place up.
We can handle this in private.

870
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:56,918
Let's go to your office.

871
01:10:57,263 --> 01:10:59,891
I'll make some drinks for us all.
We'll talk about it. Come on.

872
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,414
Are you flipping out?

873
01:11:21,754 --> 01:11:24,188
No. I'm happy! I'm not pregnant!

874
01:11:26,059 --> 01:11:26,753
That's great.

875
01:11:28,928 --> 01:11:31,226
Listen, you were sweet and
I'm sorry I was hard on you.

876
01:11:31,498 --> 01:11:33,466
No, I deserved it.
I've been acting like a jerk.

877
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:36,596
I hate myself.
I'm gonna get that scholarship.

878
01:11:36,903 --> 01:11:37,767
That's good, isn't it?

879
01:11:38,004 --> 01:11:40,404
No, I've been a creep lately
and I just can't help it.

880
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,800
You're not a creep.

881
01:11:42,075 --> 01:11:42,734
Yes, I am.

882
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:43,568
No, you're not.

883
01:11:44,144 --> 01:11:45,475
All right, maybe you are a little bit.

884
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:49,812
Listen, you're good deep down.
I know you'll do the right thing.

885
01:11:53,253 --> 01:11:55,414
I demand satisfaction!

886
01:11:55,922 --> 01:11:57,321
Oh, you want satisfaction.

887
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:00,749
I'll tell you what's real satisfying.
Cash!

888
01:12:00,827 --> 01:12:02,761
I'll shoot you 18 holes
for 10,000 bucks.

889
01:12:07,767 --> 01:12:09,997
Why, I could beat you with one arm.

890
01:12:10,637 --> 01:12:13,936
How about teams for $20,000?
You can have Dr. Frankenputz.

891
01:12:14,607 --> 01:12:15,733
I beg your pardon!

892
01:12:15,975 --> 01:12:17,033
And I'll take Ty.

893
01:12:17,977 --> 01:12:21,174
Hey, fellows. Don't include me
in on it. I don't have time.

894
01:12:21,447 --> 01:12:23,438
Come on. You're an ace.
Everybody knows it!

895
01:12:26,553 --> 01:12:29,545
I don't play golf for money...
against people.

896
01:12:30,356 --> 01:12:31,323
Are you religious or something?

897
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:34,451
You might say that.

898
01:12:39,465 --> 01:12:42,901
Can I have a word with you?
In private.

899
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:45,300
Sure thing, Judge.

900
01:12:55,782 --> 01:12:57,272
Your father and I prepped together...

901
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:59,079
...went to war together,
played golf together.

902
01:13:00,286 --> 01:13:02,015
We built this club, he and I!

903
01:13:02,822 --> 01:13:04,790
Let's face it. Some people...

904
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:06,681
...simply do not belong.

905
01:13:11,297 --> 01:13:14,027
Let's not... cave in too easy, huh?

906
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,334
What do you say, Ty?

907
01:13:32,318 --> 01:13:33,546
Let's make it $40,000.

908
01:13:34,854 --> 01:13:35,752
Hey! Great!

909
01:13:40,226 --> 01:13:42,421
My dad... never liked you.

910
01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:44,820
I'll see you two tomorrow
morning on the golf course!

911
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:55,534
I have to laugh...

912
01:13:57,477 --> 01:13:59,138
...because I've often asked myself...

913
01:13:59,612 --> 01:14:02,274
My foe, my enemy, is an animal...

914
01:14:03,149 --> 01:14:04,116
...and in order to conquer him...

915
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:07,880
...I have to think like an animal.
And whenever possible...

916
01:14:08,521 --> 01:14:10,011
...to look like one.

917
01:14:13,126 --> 01:14:13,785
I've got to get inside...

918
01:14:14,127 --> 01:14:16,652
...this dude's hole and
crawl around for a few days.

919
01:14:17,864 --> 01:14:20,230
Who is the gopher's ally?
His friend?

920
01:14:21,334 --> 01:14:23,928
The harmless squirrel
and the friendly rabbit.

921
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:29,234
I'm going to use you guys
to do my dirty work for me.

922
01:14:38,818 --> 01:14:40,809
Look at it. That's the gopher.

923
01:14:58,805 --> 01:14:59,464
There she is!

924
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:05,772
This is it! It's the Title!

925
01:15:23,129 --> 01:15:24,721
All right, show yourself,
you little varmint!

926
01:15:25,164 --> 01:15:26,062
If you've got the guts.

927
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:28,629
Son of a bitch.

928
01:15:29,469 --> 01:15:32,063
Where did you go?
Oh, hi, Carl.

929
01:15:37,577 --> 01:15:38,373
Mind if I play through?

930
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:42,037
Sure. Go right ahead. Are you
getting in a late night or something?

931
01:15:42,515 --> 01:15:43,812
I was just loosening up a bit.

932
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,813
Was that your ball I heard rambling
through here?

933
01:15:45,952 --> 01:15:46,976
Yeah. Did you see my ball?

934
01:15:50,156 --> 01:15:50,815
Try this.

935
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:52,250
That's it!

936
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,156
Is this your place?

937
01:15:56,195 --> 01:15:56,889
What do you think?

938
01:15:58,998 --> 01:15:59,760
It's really awful.

939
01:16:01,401 --> 01:16:04,165
Well, I have a lot of things on order.
You know, credit trouble.

940
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,659
I'm an assistant greens keeper.

941
01:16:05,738 --> 01:16:08,502
They say that doesn't mean anything
until I'm the head greens keeper.

942
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:09,730
Can you give me a ruling on this?

943
01:16:09,842 --> 01:16:10,740
Make yourself comfortable.

944
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:12,841
No, I don't want to stick
to anything in here.

945
01:16:13,212 --> 01:16:14,839
Here, take this thing off.
This is dirty.

946
01:16:15,114 --> 01:16:15,773
Don't go to any trouble.

947
01:16:19,485 --> 01:16:20,315
Fire her up.

948
01:16:20,787 --> 01:16:21,481
With my lips?

949
01:16:22,722 --> 01:16:23,916
Go ahead. Right back.

950
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:26,181
If I could just borrow a
wedge or something and...

951
01:16:26,459 --> 01:16:29,053
...you could open a curtain, I could
get right through that window, I guess.

952
01:16:29,195 --> 01:16:31,163
People say I'm an idiot or something...

953
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,891
...because all I do
is cut lawns for a living.

954
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,925
People don't say things about you.
As far as you know.

955
01:16:36,736 --> 01:16:39,500
Well, I'm working on it so I don't
ever have to, you know.

956
01:16:39,705 --> 01:16:41,172
I'll be the head greens keeper...

957
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,367
...hopefully within six years.
That's my schedule.

958
01:16:43,576 --> 01:16:47,444
But I am studying this stuff,
so I know it... you know... like...

959
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,445
...chinch bugs. You know...

960
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:52,181
...manganese. A lot of people
don't even know what that is.

961
01:16:53,953 --> 01:16:55,011
Nitrogen...

962
01:16:55,288 --> 01:16:57,552
Maybe just open a curtain
and I can just get out of here.

963
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:00,884
I invented my own kind of grass, too.
Did you know that? Look at this.

964
01:17:01,127 --> 01:17:02,924
This is registered.
Carl Spackler's Bench.

965
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:07,022
I've felt grass like this before.
I've played on this stuff.

966
01:17:07,233 --> 01:17:10,168
This is a hybrid.
This is a cross bluegrass,

967
01:17:10,436 --> 01:17:12,734
...Kentucky bluegrass, featherbed bench,

968
01:17:13,372 --> 01:17:15,465
...and northern California sinsemilla.

969
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:17,702
The amazing stuff about this...

970
01:17:17,777 --> 01:17:20,109
...is that you can play 36 holes
on it in the afternoon...

971
01:17:20,913 --> 01:17:23,143
...take it home and just get stoned...

972
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:24,841
...at night on this stuff.

973
01:17:25,184 --> 01:17:26,412
I've got pounds of this stuff.

974
01:17:29,188 --> 01:17:32,680
Say, let's have a little bit of this.
Look at this. Try it.

975
01:17:33,659 --> 01:17:35,627
I really don't do this very often.

976
01:17:35,795 --> 01:17:38,059
You're going to love it. This is
dynamite. Watch out for this.

977
01:17:38,164 --> 01:17:39,563
Well, maybe one drag,
then I've got to go.

978
01:17:47,139 --> 01:17:50,302
It's a little harsh.
Here. Cannonball it!

979
01:17:54,714 --> 01:17:55,612
Cannonball it right back...

980
01:17:59,485 --> 01:18:02,579
...then one more of these right
on top of it! Cannonball coming!

981
01:18:09,629 --> 01:18:12,120
Can I have a drop?
Just a drop... myself?

982
01:18:15,468 --> 01:18:16,696
That's fine for me. That's good.

983
01:18:18,838 --> 01:18:20,703
Can I say something to you?

984
01:18:23,142 --> 01:18:25,303
You've been acting psychotically
lately.

985
01:18:27,146 --> 01:18:27,874
Why?

986
01:18:28,314 --> 01:18:30,839
I've been a little under strain.
I have to play with Smails tomorrow...

987
01:18:32,652 --> 01:18:33,380
...in a money match.

988
01:18:33,986 --> 01:18:37,012
If he bothers you,
I'll take care of him.

989
01:18:37,323 --> 01:18:40,315
What you've got to do is cut
the hamstring on the back of his leg...

990
01:18:40,393 --> 01:18:41,382
...right at the bottom.

991
01:18:42,061 --> 01:18:43,028
He'll never play golf again...

992
01:18:43,829 --> 01:18:46,764
...because his weight
displacement goes back...

993
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:48,496
...and all his weight
is on his right foot...

994
01:18:48,568 --> 01:18:50,399
...and he'll be pushing
everything off to the right.

995
01:18:50,503 --> 01:18:52,630
He'll never come through on anything.
He'll quit the game.

996
01:18:53,172 --> 01:18:55,367
That would work. I'm going to
call you if I need that help.

997
01:18:55,575 --> 01:18:57,042
But, seriously, no b. S...

998
01:18:58,010 --> 01:19:01,741
...if you ever want to rap or
just get weird with somebody.

999
01:19:02,548 --> 01:19:03,708
You know... buddies.

1000
01:19:04,016 --> 01:19:05,916
I'll drop by. You drop
by my place any time.

1001
01:19:06,419 --> 01:19:08,546
What's your address?
You're on Briar, right?

1002
01:19:10,756 --> 01:19:11,723
Do you have a pool?

1003
01:19:13,025 --> 01:19:16,552
A pool and a pond.
A pond would be good for you.

1004
01:19:16,929 --> 01:19:17,657
Natural spring.

1005
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:22,759
Anything would be good.
Well, I'm going to clean this up.

1006
01:19:23,069 --> 01:19:24,661
You go ahead. It looks fine to me.

1007
01:19:25,538 --> 01:19:26,232
Thanks for the dope.

1008
01:19:41,554 --> 01:19:43,419
You carry my bag.

1009
01:19:53,799 --> 01:19:57,064
Get back there! What do you think
you're doing? Get off of here!

1010
01:19:58,337 --> 01:20:00,828
This is a golf course,
not a parking lot!

1011
01:20:01,307 --> 01:20:03,138
Now back this thing
out of here right now!

1012
01:20:04,744 --> 01:20:05,403
Hey, look at that!

1013
01:20:06,512 --> 01:20:08,412
Don't play games with me.

1014
01:20:08,481 --> 01:20:10,415
Put that steering wheel over here
where it belongs...

1015
01:20:10,716 --> 01:20:11,842
...and get this out of here!

1016
01:20:13,953 --> 01:20:14,647
Let's play golf!

1017
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:20,258
Don't do it! I didn't do that!

1018
01:20:22,161 --> 01:20:23,287
Oh, there's my phone!

1019
01:20:23,462 --> 01:20:25,896
I'm getting a little tired of this.
Gentlemen, it's about time we...

1020
01:20:25,965 --> 01:20:29,423
I told you never to call me on the
golf course! What's that? Then sell!

1021
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:31,864
They're all selling? Then buy!

1022
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:35,935
I'll tell you what.
Let me have the Coast. Any Coast!

1023
01:20:36,676 --> 01:20:37,370
What do you want?

1024
01:20:38,244 --> 01:20:39,734
Can I use your phone? I have a call.

1025
01:20:39,879 --> 01:20:40,538
Is it a long distance?

1026
01:20:42,615 --> 01:20:45,846
Gentlemen, we all know this is
illegal and against club practice...

1027
01:20:46,552 --> 01:20:48,247
...and I'd like to ask at this time...

1028
01:20:48,621 --> 01:20:52,955
...if you all agree to waive all
sanction against said referee...

1029
01:20:53,559 --> 01:20:55,356
...or anything that might get me fired.

1030
01:20:59,131 --> 01:21:00,826
The match is for $20,000 each.

1031
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,129
Lowest score wins the hole
in regulation match play.

1032
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:09,202
I have a number of tees in my hand.
Your Honor, odd or even?

1033
01:21:09,508 --> 01:21:10,167
Odd!

1034
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:12,971
Odd, it is. Your honor... Your Honor.

1035
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:17,811
Hey, tiger, here.
Keep it fair, will you?

1036
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:19,312
No, I can't accept this.

1037
01:21:24,356 --> 01:21:25,152
Driver, please.

1038
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:35,795
Don't smile at me a lot, okay?

1039
01:21:43,743 --> 01:21:48,407
The Judge and Mr. Czervik have
a $100,000 match going on!

1040
01:21:49,515 --> 01:21:51,312
What do you want to do?

1041
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:54,086
Five on Mr. Czek.

1042
01:22:01,026 --> 01:22:02,357
Hello? Anybody home?

1043
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:09,467
Hello, Mr. Gopher!
It's me, Mr. Squirrel.

1044
01:22:12,138 --> 01:22:13,400
Just a harmless squirrel.

1045
01:22:13,472 --> 01:22:16,407
Not a plastic explosive or anything.
Nothing to be worried about.

1046
01:22:16,709 --> 01:22:20,338
I'm just here to make your last hours
on earth as peaceful as possible.

1047
01:22:20,913 --> 01:22:23,381
Don't mind this.
This is doctor's orders.

1048
01:22:23,716 --> 01:22:26,276
You don't mind if I just pop
in there for a few laughs?

1049
01:22:26,786 --> 01:22:29,880
That's right.
Or in the words of Jean-Paul Sartre...

1050
01:22:30,356 --> 01:22:32,290
"Au revoir, gopher."

1051
01:22:35,094 --> 01:22:36,584
This is going to be sweet.

1052
01:22:56,081 --> 01:22:57,742
That kangaroo just stole my ball!

1053
01:23:14,466 --> 01:23:15,490
What's up, Doc?

1054
01:23:46,298 --> 01:23:49,631
I don't understand it!
I'm playing the worst game of my life!

1055
01:23:51,303 --> 01:23:52,634
Don't put yourself down, Al.

1056
01:23:53,205 --> 01:23:56,732
You're not... you're not good.
You stink.

1057
01:24:03,148 --> 01:24:06,140
Fifty bucks the Smails kid
picks his nose.

1058
01:24:11,957 --> 01:24:13,219
All right, kid, take your time.

1059
01:24:20,199 --> 01:24:21,564
Fifty bucks more says he eats it.

1060
01:24:24,403 --> 01:24:25,700
Don't do it, kid!

1061
01:24:36,048 --> 01:24:37,208
That kid will eat anything!

1062
01:24:37,483 --> 01:24:38,381
He was hungry.

1063
01:24:38,617 --> 01:24:42,883
What do you say, Al?
Shall we press on?

1064
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:45,416
Hey, Judge, cheer up, will you?

1065
01:24:46,692 --> 01:24:50,685
My boat needs exactly $20,000
worth of repairs.

1066
01:24:51,597 --> 01:24:53,531
So does your brain!
You want to double it?

1067
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,230
Fine! $40,000 apiece!

1068
01:24:57,736 --> 01:24:59,203
All right! You've got it!

1069
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:06,707
Hold on, Judge! That's my office.
I better get going.

1070
01:25:06,912 --> 01:25:08,607
No. You're in for half of $80,000.

1071
01:25:11,517 --> 01:25:13,314
Probably just a routine emergency.

1072
01:25:37,343 --> 01:25:41,677
Why did I double it? I should have
stayed home and played with myself!

1073
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:46,346
I saw Smails before. He was cheating.

1074
01:25:48,921 --> 01:25:52,448
Nobody likes a tattletale...
except, of course, me.

1075
01:26:00,566 --> 01:26:02,659
Oh! My arm! It's broken!

1076
01:26:03,769 --> 01:26:05,066
What has this buffoon done now?

1077
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:09,366
Okay, let's have a look.
That might be a fractured ulna.

1078
01:26:09,842 --> 01:26:11,434
I'm afraid you forfeit.

1079
01:26:11,877 --> 01:26:13,845
Who says so? The match is a draw!

1080
01:26:14,146 --> 01:26:16,706
You don't play, you lose. Right, Lou?

1081
01:26:17,082 --> 01:26:19,380
That's right,
unless you allow him a substitute.

1082
01:26:22,354 --> 01:26:23,651
Spaulding can play out eight holes.

1083
01:26:24,289 --> 01:26:28,157
Actually, Judge, I think it's
up to us to pick a substitute.

1084
01:26:29,962 --> 01:26:30,621
Who do you want?

1085
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:34,495
Sonja Henie is out.
We'll take Danny Noonan.

1086
01:26:36,101 --> 01:26:37,625
Danny is an employee of the club.

1087
01:26:38,237 --> 01:26:41,832
He can't work and play, particularly
in something as illegal as this!

1088
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:43,402
Makes a lot of sense.

1089
01:26:45,144 --> 01:26:46,543
If you win,
I'll make it worth your while.

1090
01:26:55,888 --> 01:26:56,547
I'll play.

1091
01:26:57,556 --> 01:26:59,114
You don't want that scholarship,
do you?

1092
01:26:59,491 --> 01:27:00,355
I guess I don't.

1093
01:27:00,759 --> 01:27:02,056
I guess you don't!

1094
01:27:35,594 --> 01:27:37,084
Don't worry. It's good luck.

1095
01:27:39,031 --> 01:27:39,690
In Haiti!

1096
01:28:04,123 --> 01:28:05,090
You've got to win this hole.

1097
01:28:06,091 --> 01:28:07,683
I kind of thought
winning wasn't important.

1098
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,322
Me winning isn't! You do!

1099
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:11,091
Great grammar.

1100
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:19,427
See your future. Be... your future.

1101
01:28:19,972 --> 01:28:22,202
Make... make it!

1102
01:28:23,442 --> 01:28:26,502
Make your future.
I'm a veg, Danny.

1103
01:28:26,979 --> 01:28:28,708
Give me this.
Take it easy, will you, Ty?

1104
01:28:47,466 --> 01:28:48,364
Hey, Mr. Gopher?

1105
01:28:54,139 --> 01:28:58,166
Gentlemen, this match is all even.
Final hole. Doctor, you are away.

1106
01:29:29,474 --> 01:29:31,965
Spaulding, this calls
for the old Billy Baroo.

1107
01:29:50,095 --> 01:29:51,027
This is a biggy!

1108
01:29:52,164 --> 01:29:53,062
Don't let me down, Billy!

1109
01:29:53,565 --> 01:29:56,534
Forty thousand dollars... Billy!

1110
01:30:05,244 --> 01:30:06,211
I knew you'd do it!

1111
01:30:49,788 --> 01:30:53,781
"Silver wings upon their chest...

1112
01:30:55,627 --> 01:30:59,393
"...these are men, America's best."

1113
01:31:05,237 --> 01:31:08,502
Don't worry about this one.
If you miss it, we lose.

1114
01:31:27,926 --> 01:31:30,190
Hey, Judge! Double or
nothing he makes it!

1115
01:31:30,462 --> 01:31:31,258
Eighty thousand dollars!

1116
01:31:35,434 --> 01:31:36,093
What's that, Judge?

1117
01:31:38,136 --> 01:31:39,125
You're on!

1118
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:46,399
We're waiting!

1119
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:57,288
Noonan... you can do it!

1120
01:32:29,955 --> 01:32:32,014
You lose it... buddy!

1121
01:32:35,527 --> 01:32:36,186
Fore!

1122
01:33:20,105 --> 01:33:21,003
It's a birdie!

1123
01:34:02,047 --> 01:34:04,914
All right, Smails, that's 80 grand.
Now fork it over!

1124
01:34:05,784 --> 01:34:08,844
I'll give you nothing!
Absolutely nothing, you understand!

1125
01:34:10,055 --> 01:34:11,920
I figured as much! Hey, Moose!

1126
01:34:12,257 --> 01:34:14,589
Rocco!
Help the judge find his checkbook.

1127
01:34:16,495 --> 01:34:19,555
Well, I, uh... oh, I will.

1128
01:34:20,599 --> 01:34:22,692
Hey, everybody!
We're all going to get laid!
