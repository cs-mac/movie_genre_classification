# Invercargill March

3
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,668
You know how they say
bad luck comes in threes?

4
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,291
Yeah, well, I thought that was a load
of shit, but it turns out it's true.

5
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,255
It was not a joy ride.

6
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,848
I was just
trying to do some thinking and stuff,

7
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,968
and I think pretty good
when I'm doing laps.

8
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,150
Oh!

9
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,747
This was my first bit of bad luck.

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,786
I knew that cop
would give me a hard time,

11
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,125
especially with
just the one headlight working,

12
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,541
so... I did the smart thing.

13
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,592
That way, the cop could only tell me
off for forgetting to put my lights on,

14
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,587
instead of doing me for my warrant.

15
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,675
And then another bit of bad luck.

16
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,804
Ah! Ooh! Ooh! Ohh! Ha! Ha!

17
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,057
Oh! Agh! Agh!

18
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,065
And then, to top it all off -
bad luck number three.

19
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,821
Aghhh!

20
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,532
You know how they say
don't cross the path of a black cat?

21
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,324
Yeah, well... add ginger to the mix,
that's what I say.

22
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,038
Agh!

23
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,889
Jesus.

24
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,065
Ah... God.

25
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,909
OK...

26
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,448
Hey.

27
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,040
Hey.

28
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,295
Hey, mate. Uh, what's your name?

29
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,461
Hey?

30
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,340
- Gavin. Ah...
- No, no!

31
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,886
Uh, Gary, yeah?

32
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,054
No, no, no...

33
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,893
With a J... With a J.

34
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,435
J? J... Uh... Jeremy?

35
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,979
Adam? John?

36
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,772
Am I close?

37
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,164
Oh, it's Jeurgen. Yeah?

38
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,658
Yes. Yes.

39
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,160
Jeurgen, you're...
you're gonna be fine, mate.

40
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,717
Jeurgen? Hey?

41
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,427
No, no, no, no. Don't do that.

42
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,467
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

43
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,215
Jeurgen. Hey.

44
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,308
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

45
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,644
Hey, hey, hey! Fuck. Come on!

46
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,512
Hey. No, no, no.

47
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,435
Oh, fuck! Come on!

48
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,559
Come on, man! Agh! Fuck!

49
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,606
Oh, fuck! Agh!

50
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,525
Agh! Agh!

51
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,864
Oh, fuck.

52
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,245
Agh...

53
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,410
Fuck.

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,816
Oh!

55
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,568
Uh...

56
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,083
Oh, my God. Uh...

57
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,874
Fuck!

58
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,508
Agh!

59
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,150
And that's where Nige's bed used to be.

60
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,486
Well, that's where it was
three weeks ago to this day.

61
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,242
Did you know that you shed skin,
like, more than a snake?

62
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,161
Like, I think about one tenth
of your skin comes off every day,

63
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,537
so... basically there's like, dozens
of, like, old Niges on the floor.

64
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,584
So I'm not exactly
gonna vacuum that up.

65
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:41,682
Deano? Deano?
Wake up! Deano!

66
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,185
Deano! Fuck.

67
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,355
Hey. Deano. Hey.

68
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,106
Fuck off, Nige.

69
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,951
- Deano, please!
- Fuck off!

70
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,072
Deano!

71
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,290
Come for your
toasted sandwich maker, have you?

72
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,414
Well, it's still busted.
Thanks for asking.

73
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,835
Deano.

74
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,672
I'm in a lot of trouble.

75
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,217
Did you get the blood tests back?
I knew that kid wouldn't be yours.

76
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,340
Monica's a slutbag, mate.
Could be mine.

77
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,092
- I'm in a lot of trouble.
- No. Oi.

78
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,014
Why don't you get Gav to help?

79
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,401
Deano!

80
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,405
Come on, man. Deano!

81
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,533
Could you
please open the fucking door?

82
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,394
So what's up, Nige?

83
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,187
I, uh... I've uh...

84
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,439
I- I... Killed someone.

85
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,442
Yeah. Yeah, you killed me
three weeks ago, Nige.

86
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,193
- Hey?
- I'm dead.

87
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,036
I'm dead on the inside.

88
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,407
I can't fuckin' feel anything.
It's agony.

89
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,000
- Deano...
- What do you care?

90
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,960
...I've actually fucking killed someone.

91
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,377
I ran over a fucking backpacker.
He's fucking actually fucking dead.

92
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,500
I'm freaking out!

93
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,469
What? Oi, what?

94
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,010
I've killed someone!

95
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,974
There was blood
coming out of his stomach

96
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,764
and his head and stuff...

97
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,853
He had fucking blood
coming out of his face!

98
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,393
- Oi! Shut up!
- His guts were...

99
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,641
Use that. Use this, your knob-end.

100
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,268
What do you mean
you ran over a backpacker?

101
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,896
Did you actually
run over a backpacker?

102
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,274
Yeah. Well, it'd be
a pretty weird lie, don't you think?

103
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,078
Fuck, Nige.

104
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,538
# Two little boys
had two little toys... #

105
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,712
Me and Nige
have been best friends for 15 years,

106
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,710
ever since Nige's first day at school.

107
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,838
Alright, settle down, class.
This is Nigel from Mataura.

108
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,308
Why don't you go
and find your seat, Nigel?

109
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,475
# One little chap then had a mishap... #

110
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,643
I am a robot.

111
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,521
I knew what it was like
to be the new kid.

112
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,191
Mum moved us here from Australia
when I was six and a half.

113
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,862
# As his young playmate said... #

114
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,578
# Did you think
I would leave you crying?

115
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,197
# When there's room
on my horse for two... #

116
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,451
Every second weekend
he'd come to our crib in the Catlins.

117
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,919
Deano was kind of like
another member of our family.

118
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,584
We did everything together...

119
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,209
I pretty much taught Nige
everything he knows, which isn't much,

120
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,712
'cause Nige is a bit fuckin' stupid,
but still... I taught him how to fight,

121
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,135
taught him how to do cunnilingus.

122
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,349
# I wonder if we'll remember... #

123
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,845
I reckon I learned more
from Deano than I ever learned in class.

124
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,690
# We were two little,
we were two little boys! #

125
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,277
When Nige's folks left town,
we went flatting together.

126
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,693
We shared the same room, but,
like, just to save on rent and that.

127
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,236
Smart, you know?

128
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,872
Deano was really great to live
with and he was really nice to me too.

129
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,116
- Happy birthday!
- Snails!

130
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,664
...to go with this.

131
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,546
Maybe 'cause we're going
to Surfers Paradise...

132
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,041
...in fuckin' Australia.
- Yeah!

133
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,960
That was an amazing trip.

134
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,883
I fucking loved it.

135
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,848
Yeah, we flatted
together for seven years.

136
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,069
Seven wicked... awesome years.

137
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,365
Dinner will be ready in a sec.

138
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,361
But after a while,
I guess I just started to wonder...

139
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,407
Fuck off!

140
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,451
...maybe there's more to life than this.

141
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm fucking serious! Get out!

142
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,706
Fuckin' Judas! Judas!

143
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,177
I've missed you.

144
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,092
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

145
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,010
Couldn't get out of bed.

146
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,600
Do you know what it's like
when you can't get out of bed?

147
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,845
- Uh...
- Basically just stuck in bed.

148
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,973
- Yeah.
- Didn't eat.

149
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,940
Didn't eat for four days.

150
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,151
Ever tried that?
Not eating for four days?

151
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,396
- Uh... no.
- If you don't eat for eight, you die.

152
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,147
So I was basically half-dead.

153
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,070
Probably you should
eat something then, just...

154
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,409
Fuck. Sayonara, Nige.
Have a good night.

155
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,574
Hey. Deano! Deano!

156
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,664
Mate, what do you want me to do?

157
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,830
How can I help you, if you won't
even admit what you did wrong?

158
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,421
One word. It's all I want from you.
One important word.

159
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,210
You won't say it.

160
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,260
- Please?
- Not 'please', you fuckwit. 'Sorry'.

161
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,221
Oh... yeah... sorry. OK?

162
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,011
Alright.

163
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,805
I accept your apology, Nige.

164
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,601
I've decided I'm willing
to take you back into the flat.

165
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,223
- Uh...
- Yep.

166
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,568
After this is done,
we'll go get your shit. I forgive you.

167
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,062
- Move back in today, yeah?
- OK. Yeah.

168
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,190
- Alright?
- Yeah.

169
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,025
Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,744
- Awesome.
- Awesome. Yeah.

171
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,454
Awesome.

173
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,328
What are you... What are you doing?

174
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,967
It's not... An ideal place.

175
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,132
It was just, like,
the easy... it was closest.

176
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,675
It's not an ideal place, mate.

177
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,844
- It's got fuckin' lights all over it.
- Yeah.

178
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,973
Oh. Shit.

179
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,642
Fuck, Nige.

180
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,982
I'm a fuckwit.
I'm a fuckwit, Deano. Ah...

181
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,399
Well, you're not a fuckwit, alright?
Just got to chill the fuck out.

182
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,277
- Did you touch him?
- Yeah, he didn't get there by himself.

183
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,448
Alright. Just... You've put
fingerprints and shit all over him.

184
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,911
Shit. Right.

185
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,537
Shit. Fuck.

186
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,966
Oi. Abba.

187
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,006
Hey, he's definitely dead.

188
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,758
Yeah, I told you he's very dead.

189
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,560
Fuck.

190
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,522
Oh, for fuck's sake.

191
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,269
Fuck, get off my fucking foot.

192
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,068
Oh, get down here.

193
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,611
Fuckin' come on!

194
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,483
I just... I'll keep a lookout.

195
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,111
Fuck, I can't lift him by myself.
Fuckin' get down here.

196
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,871
You could not have put him
in a worse spot. Do you know that?

197
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,494
It's like a game
of fuckin' pick-up sticks down here.

198
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,756
Hey, he's still warm.

199
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,594
Yeah, no, they don't go stiff
for, like, a day.

200
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,339
One, two, three.

201
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,758
Fuckin' go, Nige! Go!

202
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,142
Power. Power... for the thrust up.

203
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,561
Ready? One, two, three.

204
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,274
And thrust.

205
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,485
Thrust up. Oh, fuck, Nige!

206
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,070
Fuckin' lift.

207
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,235
What the fuck is wrong with you?

208
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,982
Fireman's lift.

209
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,666
Agh!

210
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,086
Oh! Oh. Watch your fuckin' hand.

211
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,301
Oh.

212
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,467
Yuck.

213
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,681
I'll go check
if the coast is clear.

214
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,174
- Alright?
- Yeah.

217
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,119
Fuck, yeah! Let's go, Nige!

218
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,336
Go, go, go!
Achtung! Achtung!

219
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,312
Alright. Come on.

220
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,025
Double-time, double-time.
# A-A-A-Amen #

221
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,939
Is that your double-time?

222
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,029
# A-A-A-A... Amen #
Fuckin' triple-time.

# Amen

225
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,706
# A-A-A-Amen. #

226
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,004
Do you think we should
go to the police? Cops?

227
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,296
Bit late for that, Nige.
Cops aren't gonna be happy about this.

228
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,170
Go to the cops, you're definitely
going to jail. Alright?

229
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,469
If you try to get away with it,
then you might not go to jail. So...

230
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,558
Yeah, but if we don't get away with it,

231
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,473
then I think I might go to jail
for longer 'cause...

232
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,769
Nah. Something like this - ten years.
What's ten years?

233
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,188
That's like how long it takes
an elephant to grow its tusks.

234
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,982
You know, it's nothing, really.

235
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,525
Eh?

236
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,865
Well... bottom line - do you want
to have a limp cock about this?

237
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,155
Or face up to it like a man?

238
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,869
Eh?

239
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,909
Man. You wanna be a man?

240
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,033
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alright, let's fuckin' do it.

241

# A-A-A-A... Amen #

242
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,706
Deano's not scared
of this sort of thing.

243
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,833
He's not much good in normal life,

244
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,757
but when the shit hits the fan,
Deano always knows what to do.

245
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,800
What are you doing?
- I was putting rocks inside his jacket.

246
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,927
They'll fall out.
Put them in his bag.

247
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,725

# A-A-A-A-Amen. #

252
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,155
Wait. Actually... Nige, wait.

253
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,954
Perhaps you should say a few words
before we chuck him in.

254
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:30,205
Nige, he's dead. He's not gonna
get a funeral, so... say something.

255
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,299
Uh... I don't know what to say.

256
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,418
Alright, fuck it, fuck it. I'll do it.

257
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,590
Let us pray.

258
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:43,385
We are gathered here today,
uh, to celebrate... a young life

259
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,933
cut short at the knees
by a horrible accident.

260
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,976
Um... Jeurgen.

261
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,225
Didn't really get the chance
to know you, mate,

262
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,648
but, uh, you seem like
a pretty good bloke.

263
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,522
Um... hope you really
enjoyed New Zealand

264
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,649
and, like, all that she had to offer.

265
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,027
All the beautiful mountains
and the lakes and all her nature

266
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,280
and bet you really loved those fjords,
if you got a chance to see them.

267
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,408
That's probably enough
for a speech, Deano.

268
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,411
Yeah, alright. Um...
getting the wind-up here, Jeurgen,

269
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,164
so... Um... Have a good one.

270
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,711
Uh... good on you, mate, and RIP.

271
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,880
RIP, Jeurgen.

272
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,548
Alright.
Yeah?

273
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,262
Yeah. Go.

274
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,305
OK.

275
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,683
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.

276
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,191
Oh, fuck! Fuck, fuck.

277
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,102
Oh, fuck, Nige!

278
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,070
How many fuckin' rocks did you put in?

279
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,110
Oh, God!
Did you put rocks in?

280
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,201
I put five rocks in it!
You put fucking pebbles in it!

281
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,286
Fuck! Fuuuuck!

282
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,451
Fuck!
Fuckin' hurry up!

283
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,075
What'd you put
fuckin' light rocks in there for?

284
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,077
I put a lot of rocks in there!

285
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,746
Fuck. Fuck.

286
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,376
Aghhh. Agh. Agh.

287
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,001
Fuck.

288
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,425
Well, so fuckin' sink.
Why is it not sinking?

289
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,718
- Fuck.
- Deano, get that.

290
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,217
Give me that.

291
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,435
Fuck.

292
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,270
Oh, shit.

293
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,684
Fuck.
Ugh!

294
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,811
Oh, yeah, you got it, you got it.

295
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,361
- Let's get him up.
- Fuck it. Cows.

296
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,917
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Agh.

297
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,786
Put him in here.

298
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,124
Come on, girls!

299
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,296
- We can't leave him there.
- Just shove him in!

300
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,296
- We can't leave him there!
- Can't fuckin' take him home with us.

301
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,968
- Oi, Nige.
- Are you fuckin' crazy?

302
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,261
We've got to fucking take him.
I'm fucking dead.

303
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,976
Take a chill pill.
Fucking relax, alright?

304
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,561
- Agh.
- It's fine.

305
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,430
Aghhh!

306
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,967
Alright, so, just... go inside.

307
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,713
Have a shower, get changed

308
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,885
and just go to work
like everything's normal.

309
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,428
Eh?

310
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,893
That... That's the plan.
Like nothing happened.

311
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,184
Oh... so, like,
'Where were you last night, Nige? '

312
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,682
- Got a bit stoned.
- Yep.

313
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,230
- Had a pie.
- Yeah.

314
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,478
Killed Jeurgen,
then came round to your place.

315
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:45,574
No. Nige... you came over to mine,
like, we got on the cans...

316
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,694
you definitely didn't kill anyone.

317
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,320
We just got hammered.

318
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,243
Had an awesome time and just...
we were just fuckin' around.

319
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,118
You tripped on a bottle -
that's how you got a bit bloody.

320
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,541
Um, we just passed out,
woke up this morning.

321
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,210
I drove you back here
at ten past seven.

322
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,209
You went inside,
had a shower, got changed,

323
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,927
went to work like everything's normal.

324
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,637
Yeah?

325
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,632
Yeah, OK. Yeah.

326
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,389
OK.

327
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,138
So go have a shower.
Like, that's the first bit of the plan.

328
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,812
Go. OK.

329
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,684
You gonna come in?

330
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,277
What, in there?

331
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,027
Fuck that.

332
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,197
Just... stay here.
Just... Hurry up, alright?

333
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,865
Oh, fuck it. Nige.

334
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,250
Nige, no, you got...

335
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,288
Oh, fuck!

336
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,276
I'm comin'. I'm in.
Nah.

337
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:11,619
No, it'll be awesome. We'll
have classic times. Be wicked. Yeah?

338
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:15,786
Why can't I go to
the banking conference, Nige?

339
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,205
It's for people
that work at the bank.

340
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,498
Why not, Nige?

341
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,667
You know Gav?

342
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,291
Gav who does security at the bank?

343
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,838
Yeah?

344
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:31,089
Gav and I were gonna...
go to the Catlins together.

345
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,389
So there is no banking conference.

346
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,607
No.

347
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,442
Well...

348
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,368
Nah, fine, mate.
No, what's the big deal?

349
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,284
All you've done is lie to me.

350
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,583
Yeah, all you've done
is lie to my face.

351
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:07,254
Stabbed me in the back.
It's like taking a stranger...

352
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,468
- He's not a stranger.
- He is a stranger, Nige!

353
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,553
- Gav's not a stranger.
- Yes, he fucking is!

354
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,138
I work with him every day.

355
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,724
You're taking him to the one place
that we hold sacred.

356
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,471
The Catlins is full of our blood, sweat
and tears and laughter.

357
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,482
Right, fine! Fuckin' fine!
Go to the Catlins with Gav, then.

358
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,976
Hope you have a great time with Gav!

359
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,570
There's your fuckin' dinner,
Captain Grateful.

360
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,407
Unbelievable, Nige.

361
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,992
You burnt it.

362
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,658
Judas! Judas!

363
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,326
Fucking Judas!

364
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,825
Oh... God...
- You fucking Judas!

365
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,792
- Agh!
- Judas!

366
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,754
Judas!

367
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,429
Oh, hey, man.

368
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,971
Hey, you've got blood
all over you. Don't touch anything.

369
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,305
I think that Gav's gone to work, mate.
You don't have to whisper.

370
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,978
Oh, right, well...
where's your washing machine?

371
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,689
Uh... it's down here.

372
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,938
What is all this shit, anyway?
Does a girl live here?

373
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,116
Nige. Get this.

374
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,712
Thought you said he was at work.

375
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,459
Shit! Grab it! Grab it!

376
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,553
Fuckin' pull. Pull.

377
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,342
Grab it.
Get it off.

378
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,684
Hot or cold? Hot or cold wash?

379
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,700
Uh... kia ora, Deano.

380
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,163
Hey, Gav.

381
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,627
We're just, um...
Just washing.

382
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,246
- Doing some washing.
- Yeah.

383
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,919
Do you have any washing you wanna do?

384
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,167
- No.
- Yeah, it's full anyway.

385
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,839
Ooh.

386
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,384
Well, what'd you get up to
last night, Nige?

387
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:21,634
Uh... I was... uh...

388
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,512
Tripped over on a bottle.

389
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,641
Yeah, no, had a massive night.
Had a really big night at our house.

390
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,438
Just got on it.

391
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,153
Can't remember anything.
Neither can Nige.

392
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:37,070
Oh, you know... If I could
remember everything I'd forgotten,

393
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,444
I'd be a really wealthy man.

394
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,077
Gav's great.

395
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,915
I've only known him for three months,

396
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,501
but you'd think we'd known each other
for a lot longer.

397
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,370
Like a century.

398
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,623
Gav's interested in all sorts of stuff.

399
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,966
He's travelled round the whole world.

400
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,428
Gav works in security,

401
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,549
but he says he does that to make money
to do what he really loves.

402
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,225
And he has this way of looking at things
that makes you go...

403
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,972
...Whooooa.

404
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:14,479
That is why I believe
life is like a video recorder.

405
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,031
Whooooa.

406
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:22,404
# I know, I know... #

407
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,950
Nige.

408
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,079
- Get dressed. Have a shower.
- Yeah.

409
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,918
Don't just stand around in your undies.

410
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,378
Yeah.

411
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,961
Do you want some eggs, bro?

412
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,672
Yeah.

413
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,912
Remember, just... act normal, alright?

414
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,748
That's all you gotta do.

415
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,288
Nige.

416
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,206
- Yeah.
- Nige.

417
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,714
- Keep it normal.
- Normal. Normal.

418
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,209
Oh, hey. A good hangover food
is chicken livers.

419
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,964
No, Nige, no. Fuck chicken livers -
just... normal.

420
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,556
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Alright.

421
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,300
- Have a good day.
See you, Nige.

422
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,847
Normal.

423
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,519
Do you want to hop in the front, Gav?

424
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:36,018
Nah, it hardly seems worth it, bro.
I'm just going round the corner, eh?

425
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,648
What a fuckin' prick.

426
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,494
He expects me to, like, drive him round
like I'm the scum- of- the-earth chauffeur

427
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,283
and he's like a multimillionaire.

428
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,906
Who does he think he is?

429
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,205
Who's Jeurgen?

430
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,043
What did you say?

431
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,958
Jeurgen. Is he a mate of yours?

432
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,335
Oh, no. Just... um... I found that.

433
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,178
Um... I was gonna get the reward for it
to hand it in.

434
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,673
Oh, yeah. Bro, he looks like a albino.

435
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,220
- Oh, does he?
- Yeah.

436
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,433
Ka kite, bro.

437
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,976
Yep.

438
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:24,442
So that's, um, 10, 20...

439
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,536
Uh... 30.

440
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,660
30.

441
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,578
Act normal

442
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,622
- Uh, 30...
Really normal.

443
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,166
Uh...

444
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,206
30. There we go.

445
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,545
Thanks.

446
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,634
- Buongiorno.
- Uh...

447
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,678
How...

448
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,301
Hello. Southland Building
Investment Society.

449
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,474
- Oi, Nige. It's me.
- Hey. Hey.

450
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,394
- How's acting normal going?
- Uh... It's not going that well.

451
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,767
Yeah, well,
Gav found Jeurgen's passport.

452
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,065
- Uh... what?
- Yeah, I know.

453
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,611
I know - it's a little bit
of a spanner in the you-know-what.

454
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,865
But, look, oi, Nige. Listen. Stay calm.
Alright?

455
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,614
Now, you just gotta stay calm.
Here's what we're gonna do.

456
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,458
Get Gav to come to the Catlins
with us this weekend, alright?

457
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,294
Keep him away from newspapers,
television, radio,

458
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,003
like, all sorts of news.

459
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,668
Television? Is that?

460
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,839
Nige, listen, get Gav to come away
with us this weekend, alright?

461
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,836
Deano, I've got to go.
I've got a customer.

462
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,805
No, you gotta listen to me.
No, I don't care. Nige, listen to me.

463
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,345
What are you gonna get Gav to do?

464
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,687
Hi. How can I help?

465
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,232
Excuse, I...

466
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:45,276
How do I... how do I...

467
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,320
Act normal.
... change money?

468
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,318
Normal.

469
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:54,073
Normal. Normal. Normal.
Normal. Normal. Normal. Normal!

470
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,416
Sometimes when
I'm about to have a freak-out,

471
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,253
I just have to think about
something completely different,

472
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,748
so I, I take, like a mental jump
and I think about Monica.

473
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,590
And I'm having sex with her.

474
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,266
...into Kiwi.

475
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,513
How do I change to Kiwi dollar?

476
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,025
Kiwi...

477
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,115
Oh, man. I'm really excited, eh, bro?

478
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,609
I really, really want to see a penguin
at dawn.

479
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,235
I reckon the penguins

480
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,080
will probably take a big shit
when they see you coming, Gav.

481
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,449
Oh, yeah? Probably, bro.

482
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,042
Yeah, probably.

483
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,714
I've got one thing to do
before we head to the Catlins.

484
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,465
Alright, let's go.

485
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,344
Deano won't like it,
but he's not gonna stop me on this.

486
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,471
No way.

487
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,848
Don't fuck everything up, alright?

488
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,850
I won't.
Yeah, well, don't.

489
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,442
I won't!

490
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,486
- Alright. You've got one minute.
- OK.

491
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:13,361
Fifty-nine, fifty-eight, fifty-seven...

492
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,079
Six, five, four, three, two...

493
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,211
Monica!

494
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,719
Nige.

495
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,852
Now's not good.
I've got an exam tomorrow.

496
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,644
Monica, I'm in...
I'm in a little bit of trouble.

497
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,391
What is it?

498
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,486
Uh... can't really say.

499
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,357
But, um... well...

500
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,858
Oh, man.

501
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,374
Whoa. Can I put my face on it?

502
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,963
It's not yours, Nige.

503
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,716
Can I stick my ear on it anyway

504
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,462
and just see if it, like,
kicks me in the head?

505
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,007
OK.

506
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,600
Can't feel anything.

507
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,896
Oh! Ohh. Did you feel that?

508
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,145
Yeah. Whoa.

509
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,277
It's not yours, Nige.

510
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,910
I love you, Monz.

511
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,078
- Don't say that.
- I really do.

512
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,084
Well, are you still hanging out
with Deano?

513
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,216
Not... not... not really.

514
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,960
I mean... no.

515
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,679
Oi, Nige! Ditch the bitch! Let's go.

516
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,592
Well, the next time you see Dean,

517
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,437
why don't you ask him
where my Kate Bush CD is,

518
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,147
where my Beatles Abbey Road CD is,

519
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,268
where my Billy Bragg is, and where
all my fucking Bowie CDs are?

520
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,895
What are you talking about?
- Oh... hey, Monica.

521
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,023
- He stole my B-section, Nige.
- Hey?

522
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:17,993
He stole the entire B section
of my CD collection, and I want it back.

523
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,032
Oi, Nige! Fuckin' waiting!

524
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,031
Hey, Monica. Monz.

525
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,330
I, um... got you these.

526
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:34,085
Whenever you look at these roses,
I want you to think of me.

527
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,508
Oh, no. How'd that go?

528
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,475
Got any music for the trip, Deano?

529
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,471
Got any B-52s? Bananarama? Any Bon Jovi?

530
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,473
Yeah, I do. I've got all them.

531
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,396
I've also got Jeff Buckley,
Black Sabbath... Boney M.

532
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,438
What's your problem?

533
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,232
Yeah, Monica wants her CDs back.

534
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,698
Yeah, well, that's a pity, she's not
gonna get them. Right, now listen.

535
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,694
I'm gonna take the Lazy.
Go in the van with Gav, alright?

536
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,830
Alright?

537
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,871
Hear that, Gav? We're off.

538
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,039
Hoaka taua. Let's hit the highway!

539
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,003
Yeah, yeah. Waka, waka.

540
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,124
There Is No Depression In NZ

541
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,972
It's important
that I think of Jeurgen

542
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,391
as, like, well, just a piece of meat.

543
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,642
Like a butcher
just dividing up lambs into roasts.

544
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:18,113
Like if Jeurgen was yelling 'ouch'
and stuff, this would be weird,

545
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,198
but, like, basically,
you just have to go,

546
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,533
he's just like...
it's just like cutting up!

547
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,155
Like a lamb with a face
and a... and hair.

548
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,706
Slice of Heaven

549
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,500
There's no point being grossed out.

550
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,624
I mean, sometimes friendship
involves, like, unpleasant shit.

551
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,627
And that's all this is.

552
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,879
But I'm a fucking awesome friend,

553
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,472
so, like, I'm always happy
to do that shit.

554
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,307
# Ba, da, da, bum-bum, da, da, da

555
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:53,102
# Bum-bum, da, da, da
Bum-bum, da, da, da, da, dum #

556
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,897
I actually get this feeling that this is
sort of what Jeurgen would have wanted.

557
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,941
Like, knowing it was
an accident and shit,

558
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,564
like, he wouldn't want
an innocent man to go to prison.

559
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,363
Sort of like he's saying to me,
'Hey, it's alright, Deano.

560
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:08,080
I'm a goner, mate, so, just do whatever
you can to help your mate Nige. '

561
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:21,335
# Hey, I got a lot of faith in ya

562
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:25,464
# I'll stick with you, kid -
that's the bottom line

563
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:29,343
# Yeah, you have a lot of fun,
don't you?

564
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:33,188
# And living with you
is a ball of a time #

565
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,977
# Hey, beauty

566
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,350
# When the mood gets you down

567
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:41,150
# Your bottom lip's
near dragging on the ground

568
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,866
# That's when I gotta
play the clown for you

569
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,076
# Black humour made you... #

570
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,412
Oh. Forgot your key, bro?

571
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,907
Oh. No. We don't own it anymore.

572
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,874
My folks sold it a while back,

573
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,711
but... me and Deano
keep coming here anyway.

574
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,503
Might as well be ours.

575
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,427
- I'll meet you round the front.
# She's a slice of heaven

576
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,672
# Slice of heaven

577
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:12,394
# Warm moonlight over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven. #

578
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:23,237
Mm. Feel how fresh the air is, Nige?

579
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,448
- Hey?
- Breathe it in, man.

580
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,624
- Smell the fish in the sea here.
- Mm. Sure can.

581
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,921
You OK, bro?

582
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,797
Box of birds.

583
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,721
Hey, Nige, have you ever seen
that ad on the TV -

584
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,973
um... the one with the snowball in it?

585
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:04,817
Yeah, well... it was saying, like...
like, a problem is like a snowball

586
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,112
rolling downhill really, really fast.

587
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,780
Oh.

588
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:14,373
Well... I never let my problems
turn into a massive-as snowball.

589
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,118
When I've got something
on my mind, I talk about it.

590
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,162
You know?

591
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,586
And you know you can talk to me anytime,
you know?

592
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,130
And I promise, like,
no subject is taboo.

593
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,928
Hey. Want some kai?

594
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,353
Yeah.

595
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,228
# Slice of heaven
# Slice of heaven

596
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,198
# Warm moonlight over my horizon
She's a... #

597
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,863
It's the most amazing
toasted sandwich I've ever had.

598
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,906
You can taste the caramelised onion, eh?

599
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,656
Oh! Ohhh!

600
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,407
Mmm.

601
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:01,206
Ohh! Ohhh! Oh.

602
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,628
Hey... Hey, Deano.

603
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,393
Got some good memories here, eh, Deano?

604
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,189
Yeah, we do, Nige. Yeah, a lot
of good Deano and Nige memories.

605
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:29,030
Yeah, awesome ones.
All over this stretch of land.

606
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,694
Mmm.

607
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:35,116
Ka hoki aku whakaaro ki nga wa o mua.
Land of memories.

608
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,284
Yeah. For us.

609
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,457
Yeah, not really for you. Just...

610
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,328
Oi, Nige. Nige. Oi. Nige.

611
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,376
I want to talk to you, alright? Outside.

612
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,139
He's in there.

613
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,138
- Eh?
- He's in the boot.

614
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04,391
I didn't know how it'd go at first -
like, how I'd handle it.

615
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,563
But... this crazy calm came over me.

616
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,608
And then like this energy,
like my blood was pumping,

617
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:12,028
like someone stuck
a lightening bolt up my arse.

618
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:15,277
Like... I was tingling, like...
Still feeling it now, actually.

619
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,869
Eh?

620
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:20,206
You must feel it too. Like,
life's different for you now, Nige.

621
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,824
How do you mean?

622
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,452
Well... you've had your first kill.

623
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,921
Like, you're a different person.
We both are.

624
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,292
Crazy power, yeah?

625
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,136
Thought maybe we'd take him
up to Jack's Blowhole, like...

626
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,505
- No. Nah. Nah.
- Go up there tonight or...

627
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,757
- Fuck. Fuck.
- No-one's gonna be around.

628
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,511
- Nige.
- Oh, fuck!

629
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,433
Fuck. Fuck.

630
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,602
Nige? Oi!

631
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:56,697
Oh. Oh.

632
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,867
Oi, Nige. Come on.

633
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,957
Oi, Nige.

634
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,917
Oi, snap out of it.

635
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,003
Oi. Nige.

636
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,587
Oi.

637
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,258
Snap out of it. Snap out of it.

638
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,048
It's alright. It's alright.
Come back to me.

639
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,297
- Get off! Agh!
- Deano's here.

640
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,048
Deano's here.

641
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,769
Calm down, crab. Calm down, crab.
I got you. Come back to me.

642
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,558
Yeah.

643
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,399
Yeah. Oh.

644
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,027
All better?

645
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,111
That was a big one.

646
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,934
Just don't know
if I can handle prison, Deano.

647
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,100
What, mate?

648
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,473
I don't know if I can handle prison.

649
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,523
Mate, you're not going to prison.
Alright?

650
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,734
Got it all sorted.

651
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,404
Just...

652
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,744
Hey, remember first day of school

653
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,955
when you turned up
with that thing on your head

654
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,619
and you looked like a retard?

655
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,618
Remember that? And Jason Farquhar
gave you the bash?

656
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,369
- Yeah.
- Remember?

657
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,087
Yeah.

658
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,922
Who looked after you then?

659
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,668
You did.

660
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,009
Fuck, yeah. Took care of it.

661
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,889
Remember that necklace
I made with Jason Farquhar's tooth?

662
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,809
That was a sick necklace, wasn't it?

663
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,308
You used to wear that all the time.
You loved it.

664
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:58,106
Just not gonna let anything bad
happen to you, Nige.

665
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,948
Simple as that.

666
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,078
I'd take a bullet for you.

667
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,498
Yeah?

668
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,997
In the guts,

669
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,922
'cause that's, like, the place
where it takes you the longest to die.

670
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,970
You just bleed out.

671
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,301
- We should get back to Gav.
- No. Why?

672
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:12,309
Oi, Nige. It's time. Come on.

673
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,022
Hands off snaky.

674
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,993
Oh, fuck. Get in the car. Wait there.

675
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,784
Wait there for two seconds.
I'll be back. Get in the car.

676
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,950
What?

677
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,907
You alright? Let's go.

678
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,161
Start the car. Come on. Start the car.

679
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:19,164
Alright. Here we go.

680
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,048
Whoa!

681
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,971
Fuck.

682
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,889
- Hey. What's up?
- Uh...

683
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:36,310
- Um...
- Why are you fellas sneaking out for?

684
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:39,434
Nah, nah, we're just... just,
uh, just going to see the penguins.

685
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,528
- What, without me?
- Uh, you were snoring like a pig.

686
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,398
- Thought you wanted to sleep in.
- Yeah, well, I'm awake now.

687
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,400
Just wait. Just two seconds. OK? Wait.

688
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,026
Yeah, alright.

689
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,450
Alright, fucking go.
Eh?

690
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,038
Go!
Eh?

691
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,623
Fucking drive, Nige.

692
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:59,829
Oi! Hey! Hey, you fellas!

693
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,801
Des. Des. It's Betty Hancock here.

694
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,367
Look at that.

695
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,745
Where is he? What the fuck is...?

696
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,498
He's in the bag.
Mate, took ages to get him in there.

697
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,296
I had to, like,
hit into his waist, like, six times

698
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:50,047
'cause the spinal cord's,
like, so... it's, like, chewy... almost.

699
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,924
Eh? What the fuck?

700
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,891
Yeah, to get him in the bag.

701
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,729
Fuck, Deano.

702
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,645
Mate, no, no.
Like, if this was in the war, right,

703
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,143
there'd be just people
dying around us all the time.

704
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,271
We'd just be chopping up,
like, all day long

705
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,863
and putting them in bags.

706
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:11,280
In that situation, you got to think
like that. It's nothing. It's fine.

707
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,778
- Why did you do it?
- Well, to get him in the bag.

708
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,075
Yeah. Fucking I didn't tell you
to cut him up.

709
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,165
Well, how else
am I gonna get him in the bag?

710
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,784
Fuck, Deano!

711
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,535
Like, so he's got handles.

712
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,209
Oi, oi, Nige. Oi, oi. Don't freak out.

713
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,877
Hey, come here. Come here.

714
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,300
Fuck!

715
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,344
Nige! Chill!

716
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,979
It's called thinking!

717
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,563
You're fucking fucked!

718
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,510
Oi, I did it for you, Nige. So...

719
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,474
Pretty heavy.

720
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:33,615
Oi, use the hip bits.

721
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,992
I'm sorry, Jeurgen.

722
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,946
Awesome throw, man. Great chuck. Yeah.

723
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,281
Really good distance.
Like, really... Really...

724
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,188
Shut up.

725
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,816
Shut up.

726
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,469
Er...

727
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,784
- Hey, there's Gav.
- Nah, just keep going round the corner.

728
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,531
- Why?
- Just keep going.

729
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,158
- We're not finished, mate.
- Eh?

730
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,850
I wanna go find Gav.

731
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,721
Nah, he's alright. He's a big boy.
He can look after himself.

732
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,062
Nige, there's, um...

733
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,318
I think there's something in your shoe.

734
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,739
In your right shoe.

735
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,077
Oh, look at that.

736
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,493
Remember that?

737
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,745
You used to love that.
You wore it all the time.

738
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,295
That was a long time ago.

739
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,921
So people were always like,
'Where'd you get that? '

740
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,798
You were, like, 'Oh, Deano made it. '
They were like, 'Sick. '

741
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,677
And you'd wear it
and wait for me after detention,

742
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,599
like even if...

743
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:34,189
...you didn't have a detention,
you'd just wait for me

744
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,401
and... Walk home together.

745
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,770
First year of the flat,
you wore that every day,

746
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,738
like, party central.

747
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,403
It was mad and...

748
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:48,329
Remember when I shaved an N
into my pubes? Remember?

749
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,493
And we lit that tree
on the golf course on fire

750
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,287
and torched it and you were just like,

751
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,206
'This is mad, Deano.
I'll never forget this. '

752
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:59,499
Crazy times wearing that necklace.
Just like...

753
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,885
Hey, listen, mate. Nige, listen.

754
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:07,177
Sit down, sit down, sit down. Just...

755
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,635
I just want to say one word to you,
alright?

756
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,520
Nige...

757
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,269
Commitment.

758
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,105
Eh?

759
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,399
You heard me. Not gonna repeat myself.

760
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,068
Commitment.

761
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,157
Do you know what that word means?

762
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,822
- You're talking weird, Deano.
- No, I'm not.

763
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,167
Nige, commitment... Commitment
is when two people need each other.

764
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,034
Like fuckin' oxygen.

765
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,412
They never let go. They'd do anything.

766
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:42,167
For richer or poorer,
if they're sick or healthy,

767
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,793
or, like, till death do them part.

768
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,470
Pretty fuckin' serious.

769
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:52,222
I want you to wear that.

770
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,777
Yeah. Put it on, Nige.

771
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,566
It's not hard.

772
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,656
Just put the necklace on.

773
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:15,582
Nige. Put it on.

774
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,578
It's a fuckin' order - put it on.

775
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,921
Put the fuckin' necklace on!

776
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,085
Nige.

777
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,708
Nige!

778
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,760
Fuck! Nige!

779
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,447
Gav.

780
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,078
Hey, Gav.

781
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,495
Gav.

782
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,919
Rahhh!

783
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,290
Rahhh! Aghhh!

784
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,717
Deano!
Aghh!

785
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,757
I was trying to
take a photo of that, Deano.

786
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,551
- What? Yeah?
- I was taking a photo.

787
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,264
Aghhh!

788
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,725
- Sorry, Gav.
- Where the fuck did youse get to?

789
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,724
Why did youse just ditch me, then, Nige?

790
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,396
Fat fuck!

791
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,564
I thought you were
gonna follow us in the van.

792
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,904
- Nige, do you respect me?
- Yeah, course I do.

793
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:31,071
Well, if you respect me,
then don't fucking bullshit me, alright?

794
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,528
Deano told me to.

795
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,531
Oi, I need a word, Nige.

796
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,199
Fuck off, Deano.

797
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,577
- You fuck off. Come on.
- You fuck off.

798
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,746
Why don't you fuck off? Come here.

799
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,339
Fuck off.

800
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,584
- You fuck off. Come here.
- Go and get fucked.

801
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,382
- Why don't you get fucked?
- You get fucked.

802
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,130
How about you get fucked?

803
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,097
Why don't you go fuck off, you fuckhead.

804
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:58,720
Why don't you fuck off, get fucked and
be a fuckhead at the same fuckin' time?

805
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,937
- Go fuck yourself, Deano.
- Go fuck yourself.

806
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,522
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

807
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,063
- Fuck yourself fuck truck!
- Fuck your fuck truck!

808
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,652
Fuck it all! I don't wanna be
your fuckin' friend!

809
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,487
I don't wanna be your friend, Deano.

810
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,072
Bullshit.

811
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,283
I don't want to be your friend.

812
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,876
Come here, Nige.

813
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:54,571
# You packed in the morning
I stared out the window

814
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:59,197
# And I struggled for something to say #
- Fuck!

815
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,619
Fuck! Ugh! Fuck!

816
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:04,664
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

817
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,333
Fuck! Agh!

818
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,502
Fuck! Agh...

819
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,340
Agh!

820
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,300
Fuck you!

821
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,893
Agh!

822
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,512
Aghh!

823
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:27,687
# Left me just when I needed you most

824
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,195
# You

825
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:37,239
# Left me
just when I needed you most. #

826
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,270
They've been drinking. Hmm?

827
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,893
Yeah, well, boys'll be boys.

828
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,988
Oh, well, these are more like men.

829
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,031
Uh, no, you stay outside, Mrs H.

830
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,574
Oh.

831
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,089
Nige. Deano?

832
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,015
Oh, a note, is it?

833
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,759
A note.

834
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,480
Fat lot of good that'll do. Come on.

835
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,241
I've got one that's in my other book.

836
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,702
But I got one about the monkey
and the dungeon master.

837
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,038
...was basically used as a substitute

838
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:08,409
and scored the match-winning goal
in Norway's World Cup qualifier...

839
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,536
Can I help you, sir?
You want some chips?

840
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,788
Mr Johansson
has been missing since Friday...

841
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,505
Spring roll? It's very good.

842
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,670
...and police hold grave fears
for his safety

843
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,839
after the discovery
of some personal effects

844
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,213
in a roadworks hole in Dee Street,
Invercargill.

845
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,341
- You want chips?
- I don't want any fuckin' chips.

846
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,809
It doesn't look good, but...

847
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,395
...to the dungeon master,
'Your patience has been... '

848
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,015
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Then everyone fuckin' died. The end.

849
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,563
Oi, Nige.

850
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,856
Need to have a word with you, alright?

851
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,022
Oh, you're not speaking to me? Yeah?

852
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,150
Alright, well,
you might want to watch the TV

853
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:44,153
'cause I think a mate of yours is on it
playing soccer for Norway.

854
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,826
- Eh?
- The country.

855
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,744
Look - we're getting evicted, bro.

856
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:52,210
We figured we'd go bush.
I was hoping that you'd come with us.

857
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:56,708
Oh, the police. Shit, Nige, what
a crack-up. What do we do now?

858
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,333
Cops are onto us.

859
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,634
What the fuck is he doing?

860
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:06,179
Hi. This is
the Chisnalls. Leave a message.

861
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,303
Hey, Mon. Monz... Uh...
I just wanted to... Talk to you...

862
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,726
because I'm in a lot of trouble
and I just want to...

863
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,394
I might never see you again, OK?

864
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,266
And I want you
to tell the kid that if...

865
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,736
...he might never meet his dad... But
he fuckin'... I love him. Fuck off!

866
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,862
Oi.

867
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,112
Hey. Hey.

868
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,205
Nige.

869
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,535
You're in deep, thick fuckin' shit.

870
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,542
Do you know that?

871
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,881
Whole country of Norway, huh?

872
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:47,887
Man, they fuckin' love soccer.
It's like a religion to them over there.

873
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,848
Gonna be pissed when they find out

874
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,848
that you've killed
the soccer version of the Pope.

875
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,689
Reckon there's bumming in prison?

876
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,525
Yeah. Have to be.

877
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,616
Yeah, after a while, you just
start thinking, 'A hole's a hole. '

878
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,074
Someone like you...
have such a popular arsehole.

879
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:11,539
Probably have to get ticket machine
installed like they've got at delis.

880
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:14,330
Your arse ends up looking
like a smashed choc jam doughnut.

881
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:18,751
Man, in the showers,
you'll just be standing there,

882
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,498
they'll just see your fuckin' arse,

883
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,126
they'll be like
Princess Di's coming to visit them.

884
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,424
There'll be a party, mate.

885
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,218
Try not to think about it, though.

886
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,841
I could help you out,
but you're not talking to me, so...

887
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,684
...there's not really anything I can do.

888
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,553
What do you want me to say, Deano?

889
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:36,272
- I don't know, how about 'sorry'?
- Yeah.

890
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,141
- 'Sorry, Deano. '
- I'm really sorry.

891
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,144
Hey!

892
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:46,032
You know, sometimes I look at you
and I go, 'Where's the real Nige gone?'

893
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,870
I miss that Nige.

894
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,539
This one's shit.

895
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,949
Want some of this, Deano?

896
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:40,169
- Go on, bro.
- Buy a mirror, mate. I'm not your bro.

897
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,040
Think Mama would have noticed
if you came out of her.

898
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,587
Shut up, Deano.

899
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,508
- Ooh!
- No, thank you, Nige.

900
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,677
I won't shut up.

901
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,892
Agh!

902
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,181
No, no. Cut it out, man.

903
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,555
Hey, ceasefire. Come on, come on.

904
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,978
Just... Just calm down, man.

905
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:09,533
You guys ever heard of the expression
'There's an elephant in the room'?

906
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:13,658
Ever heard of the expression
'Shut up, dickhead'?

907
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:18,830
Oh... no, bro, but...
OK, it's like, picture this, OK?

908
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,458
We're all in this room, right?

909
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:26,049
And there's also, like,
there's a elephant in there.

910
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,964
But I don't know that it's there,
you know?

911
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,678
Why don't you know it's there?

912
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:34,846
Well, I guess it's invisible, you know.
Like... a really big invisible elephant.

913
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:36,935
How do we know it's there
if it's invisible?

914
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,849
The point is, guys,

915
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,223
is there something
you guys aren't telling me?

916
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,940
That's what I'm trying to say.

917
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,773
I don't know. Is there, Nige?

918
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,773
- No.
- Are you guys gay?

919
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,866
- Fuck off.
- We're so not gay.

920
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,449
Well... why are you acting
so weird, then?

921
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,107
Peer Gynt: Prelude

922
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,676
I've decided something.

923
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,224
Yeah.

924
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:49,101
I've decided that today
is gonna be the last day of Gav's life.

925
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:58,447
Don't ask me why,
but the thought really calms me down.

926
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,697
Like, overnight,
I've stopped hating his guts.

927
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,200
Those penguins
really seem to like you, Gav.

928
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:09,375
Yeah. I thought
we shared a real affinity, you know?

929
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,043
Yeah, yeah, man.

930
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:15,134
It's like the animal kingdom just
sort of like vibing together, yeah?

931
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:19,802
It's like sharing the universe
for infinity.

932
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,424
Yeah, you get it.

933
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,432
Wow.

934
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,430
No need to hate someone's guts

935
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,682
when you know
they're gonna cark it in 24 hours.

936
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,483
Nige.

937
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,987
Wake. Wake up.

938
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,381
I want to apologise
for my behaviour last night.

939
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,966
You know, just...

940
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,131
I've had a good look
at myself overnight

941
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:01,882
and I need you to know
that that was the old Deano.

942
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,681
I'm a new Deano today and...

943
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,350
...I'm sorry for the actions
of the old Deano, you know?

944
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,064
How are those eggs?

945
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:12,605
Awesome, bro. I love yolk.

946
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:15,274
Almost wish
I could tell Gav he's gonna die.

947
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,694
Like, if I was gonna die in 24 hours,
I'd wanna know,

948
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,568
so I could really make the most of it.

949
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,664
...for Mr Johannsen...

950
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,084
- Was it hot? Hot pie?
... to Missing Presumed Dead.

951
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,628
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it was a really hot pie.

952
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,172
Like I said, I'm really sorry.

953
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,591
Yeah, well, that's not gonna be
good enough, is it?

954
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:44,341
...is a national hero and a role model
for all the children of Norway.

955
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:47,727
No.

956
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,894
Hey. Hey.

957
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:01,025
Got any plans for the day, Deano?

958
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:03,902
Yeah, mate, big plans. Big plans, Gav.

959
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,780
Thought maybe
just do a round-trip of the Catlins.

960
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,577
Just see all the best bits, you know?

961
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,997
Cool.

962
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,710
# Marching music

963
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,500
We'll hit the road at 0900.

964
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,590
Take Gav to the Matai Waterfall,
the Tautuku Camp,

965
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,210
rendezvous with the dolphins
at 1400 hours,

966
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,088
past the petrified forest
and down to Slope Point.

967
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,887
And that's where Gav
takes in his final sunset.

968
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:30,386
Fuck, Gav. I'm gonna give you
the best last day ever.

969
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:31,854
Eh?

970
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:36,477
In the Catlins. Yeah, I'm gonna give you
the best last day in the Catlins.

971
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,604
Awesome, bro. I'm so excited, eh?

972
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:42,904
Yeah. Me too.

973
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,071
# Ooh, ooh

974
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:49,948
# Whoo-oo, ooh, ooh

975
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,371
# I'm counting the beat
Two, three, four, five

976
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,790
# I'm feeling the heat
Glad to be alive

977
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,209
# I'm counting the beat
Six, seven, eight, nine

978
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:01,050
# I'm wishing that you,
that you were mine

979
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,420
# Thinking about you
You think about me

980
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,968
# Think about you
Counting the beat

981
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,097
# I'm thinking about you
# Ooooohh

982
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,595
# I'm thinking about me
# Ooooohh

983
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,189
# Thinking about you

984
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,775
# Thinking about me

985
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,145
# Thinking about you

986
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,067
# Thinking about just you and me

987
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:25,567
# La-da-de-de
There ain't no place I'd rather be

988
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:30,596
# La-da-de-da, la-da-de-da

989
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,888
# La-da-de-da, la-da-de-da... #

990
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:56,606
# La-da-de-da, la-da-de-da

991
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,066
# La-da-de-da, la-da-de-da... #

992
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,523
What have we got here?

993
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,159
What do you reckon, Gav?

994
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,654
This is where me and Nige
used to come to school camps.

995
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,202
Awesome place.

996
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,700
I fingered Stephanie Filcher,
the Christian girl,

997
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,452
there's a woodshed over there.

998
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:20,500
Awesome. Didn't wash my hand
for a week. Remember that, Nige?

999
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,373
I used to make you smell it
all the time.

1000
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,341
Wicked, bro.
- It's gone now.

1001
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,461
Yeah, it's cool, huh?

1002
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,268
Oh.

1003
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,812
Hey, Gav, one time,
when all the teachers were away,

1004
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:43,232
like, the whole class
was getting up in these rafters.

1005
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,652
And we were, like, doing mega jumps
out of them, landing on the ground.

1006
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:49,526
It was mad. Everyone was doing it.

1007
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,869
Even Lisa Allcock did it.

1008
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:55,457
Except Nige. He was the only one
in the class that didn't do it.

1009
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,246
- Why?
- Yeah, isn't that right, Nige?

1010
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,369
- Yeah, pissed himself.
- True, Nige?

1011
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,246
Well, we gotta do it, then.

1012
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,874
We gotta get your confidence back, Nige.

1013
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,378
- That's a great idea. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Come on, bro.

1014
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,970
- Yeah, mate.
- Get up, man.

1015
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,930
The only barrier is your mind.

1016
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,470
Yes.

1017
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,264
Come on, Nige.
Go, Nige.

1018
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,182
- You've got this, bro.
- Yes!

1019
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,977
Go. Go, mate.
Come on, bro.

1020
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,350
- Get up there! Yes!
- Come on, you can do it.

1021
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,272
There we go.
You can do it.

1022
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,896
Oh, mate,
if Lisa Allcock could see you now...

1023
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:29,069
Do it, Nige. Nige!

1024
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:34,662
Nige! Nige! Nige! Nige!
Nige! Nige! Nige!

1025
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:39,125
Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

1026
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,837
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

1027
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,425
Nige! Nige! Nige!
Nige! Nige! Nige! Nige!

1028
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:48,964
Aghhh!

1029
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,927
Whoo-hoo!

1030
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,761
Ohh.

1031
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,229
You alright, mate?

1032
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,725
Yeah.

1033
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,487
How was that?

1034
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,231
It was easy.

1035
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,575
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

1036
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,318
- You earned it, mate.
- Yeah, bro.

1037
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:23,499
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1038
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:43,557
I suppose you realise
this is private property.

1039
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,399
Or did you not see the sign?

1040
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,939
Yeah, we saw it.

1041
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,028
So what's the problem? Can't you read?

1042
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,272
Shit, yeah. I'm awesome at reading.

1043
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:55,027
Sorry, sir. We were just having
a bit of fun in there. That's all.

1044
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,323
Sorry, Mr Abercrombie.

1045
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:00,073
Are you former students?

1046
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,200
- Uh, no. No.
- No. No.

1047
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,042
Yes, you are.

1048
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:10,008
Nigel Aitcheson and Dean Ormsby.

1049
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,922
So what are you doing now?

1050
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,669
For a job?

1051
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,673
Uh... a bank teller.

1052
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,096
Occasionally a bus driver.

1053
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,396
See, kids?

1054
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,062
That's what happens
when you muck about at school.

1055
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,934
- I resent that.
- Fuck off.

1056
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,775
You're not our teacher anymore,
Mr Dickhead.

1057
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,030
You... You can't give us
detention anymore.

1058
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,996
So... you can't do anything, can you?

1059
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,412
So, fuckin' take your old balls
and fuck off, Mr Fuckface.

1060
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,660
Yeah, fuckin' cock features.

1061
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:51,086
Fuck you, you big... Dickball.
Fuckin' jizz wad.

1062
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,381
Fuck off.

1063
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:55,969
Come on, fuck off.

1064
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:05,388
Sorry, sir.

1065
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,640
Fuck, yeah!

1066
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:11,565
- Yeah. That was pretty awesome, Nige.
Yeah, bro.

1067
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:15,030
And, like, what did he mean, laughing
at your fellas' jobs like that, eh?

1068
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:19,619
Like, when I tell people I do security,
they turn their noses up, you know?

1069
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,113
You can't judge somebody
by what they do.

1070
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,115
You judge somebody by who they are.

1071
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,208
Spot on, Gav. Spot on.

1072
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,970
Hey, Deano. Pull over.

1073
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,510
What?

1074
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,132
Pull over.

1075
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,689
Oi. Nige. What...

1076
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,562
Just... Just trust me.

1077
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,614
Alright, two minutes. Alright?

1078
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,321
Fuck off, Jeurgen. I mean it.

1079
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:31,932
Hello?

1080
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,855
Monica, don't hang up.

1081
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,478
Nige, where are you?

1082
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,821
Uh... I can't say.

1083
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:40,692
Oh, I imagined you
swinging from a noose.

1084
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:43,536
I pictured you taking pills
or slitting your wrists.

1085
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,075
I wouldn't do that, Monz.

1086
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,789
Then why did you say
I might never see you again?

1087
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,911
Are you gonna say something?

1088
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,255
I know I'm the father, Monz.

1089
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:59,252
I mean, I'm... I'm stupid,
but, uh... even I'm not that stupid.

1090
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:03,097
Nige, this baby
doesn't want you as a father.

1091
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,011
Why not?

1092
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,891
Look at yourself, Nige.

1093
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,561
Yeah, just... actually
take a look at yourself.

1094
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,775
I've changed, Monz.

1095
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,607
People don't change, Nige.

1096
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:20,106
Yes, they... Yes, they do, Monz.
They do.

1097
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,358
I've-I've... I've done so much thinking,

1098
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:26,282
it's like... my head is gonna explode
and, like, fall out

1099
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,656
into just lots of pieces.

1100
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,249
I've... Fuck, Monz, I've...
You've gotta believe me.

1101
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,871
I'm... I can be a father.
I can look after you and the baby.

1102
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,918
You can't even
look after yourself, Nige,

1103
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:39,588
I can. I can.
I'm... I'm gonna come and talk to you

1104
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,338
and we can... you know,
we can figure this out, Monz.

1105
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,469
It's my baby too.

1106
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:53,352
OK.

1107
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,520
But don't get your hopes up, Nige.

1108
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,275
- I gotta go.
- Bye.

1109
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,068
- Bye.
- Bye.

1110
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,566
Hey. I can't find my togs.

1111
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,561
Just go in your gruts. Come on.

1112
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,563
# Marching music

1113
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,566
I've heard that
for people that have killed in wars,

1114
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,614
the hardest thing is when you think
of the person you're killing

1115
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,577
as a person, you know?

1116
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,163
Like with feelings and that?

1117
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,703
Ooh!

1118
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:56,248
What you should do is start thinking
of them as, like, not human at all.

1119
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,746
Like... a robot.

1120
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,497
Or a beanbag.

1121
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,419
But I've really got to know Gav today

1122
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,967
and it's a bit hard
to pretend he's a robot.

1123
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,800
He's actually quite a good guy.

1124
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,264
Yeah!

1125
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:15,979
Look at him go.

1126
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,771
Hey, Deano. How come
you're being so nice to Gav?

1127
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,144
Come on, Nige.

1128
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:24,943
Life's too short
to carry around hate, mate.

1129
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,943
Hate's too heavy, man.
Just gotta live life to the full, yeah?

1130
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,490
Yeah.

1131
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,704
It's better to burn out than fade away.

1132
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,244
- Highlander.
- Queen soundtrack.

1133
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,993
- Yeah.
- Classic sword fights.

1134
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,995
- Yeah. Hey, Nige.
- What?

1135
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,167
- Cold splash!
- Agh!

1136
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:44,708
Aghhh!

1137
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,639
There can be only one!

1138
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:58,726
# Who wants to live forever?

1139
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:06,447
# Who want to live forever? #

1140
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,065
Nige.

1141
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,323
Holy shit!

1142
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:15,573
You know that story
where that little girl rides a whale?

1143
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,290
Well, this is far more amazing,

1144
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:21,287
because Gav is really fat and he was
riding a really little dolphin.

1145
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,664
# Forever... #

1146
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,886
Go, Gav!

1147
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:33,553
That was the most amazing thing
that's ever happened to me in my life!

1148
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,518
- Did you guys see that?
That was amazing.

1149
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,513
- Whew!
- It was fucking awesome, Gav!

1150
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,981
It's just not even
scientifically possible, is it?

1151
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:43,692
Like you're massive
and that's a tiny dolphin.

1152
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,402
- How did you do that?
- Don't know.

1153
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,021
Oh. Oh, man.

1154
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,489
I'm gonna take a while
to come down from this one, eh?

1155
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,700
Fuck, Gav's a good guy.

1156
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,865
I totally get what Nige sees in him now.

1157
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,703
You nearly killed that dolphin, man!

1158
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:58,199
Gonna be a real shame
to see him go.

1159
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:03,010
# Who wants to live forever?

1160
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:14,428
# Forever

1161
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:17,723
# Is our today... #

1162
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,773
Do you want a scone?

1163
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:59,435
# Whakaaria mai

1164
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:05,562
# Tou ripeka

1165
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:08,402
# Ki au... #

1166
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,738
Gav's singing
really tugs at the bottom of my stomach.

1167
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:13,403
It's really powerful.

1168
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:16,868
As I'm watching him, I'm thinking,
'Shall I kill him in the van? '

1169
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,828
See you, mate.

1170
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,908
Ah... ah... Aghhh!

1171
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,332
I think that'd be a nice way
for Gav to go -

1172
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:28,672
get a nice view of the ocean
and he'd be in his van, which is cool,

1173
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,461
it's like a womb to him.

1174
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:34,462
Or I could kill Gav in the bath.

1175
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:35,883
Hey!

1176
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,640
It's an exciting way to do it -

1177
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:40,760
seeing his face
as he surrenders to death

1178
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:45,435
and accepts that... it's just not his
destiny to hang out with me and Nige.

1179
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:48,149
# Kona au

1180
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:52,021
# Titiro atu ai... #

1181
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:55,403
But none of those options
are as good as plan A.

1182
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:59,950
So... all I've got to figure out
is how to get Gav to the lighthouse...

1183
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:03,575
# Au koe noho ai

1184
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:11,298
# Amene. #

1185
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:19,844
Really amazing singing, Gav.

1186
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,433
Thank you, bro.

1187
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,769
Well done.

1188
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,058
- Hey, Deano.
- Yeah?

1189
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,475
Got a bit of a confession
to make, actually.

1190
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,351
Oh, yeah?

1191
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,776
Well... to be honest, bro...

1192
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,279
...I really didn't think
I was gonna like you, eh?

1193
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,414
You know? I really try to see
the good in people, you know?

1194
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:47,035
And for a while there...
couldn't see it.

1195
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:51,376
- But you know what?
- What's that?

1196
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,795
Now I see the good in you, bro.

1197
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,173
I see the good in you.

1198
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,179
- Thanks.
- Whoa.

1199
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:01,720
Yeah.

1200
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:04,469
I see the good in you too, Gav.

1201
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:10,561
When I look at you, I see a man
my mum would be proud of.

1202
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:15,407
Yeah. Or like a... a bird... flying high

1203
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,525
above the cliffs,

1204
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:23,199
just sort of, like, settling down
and then just making everyone happy,

1205
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,414
like this awesome writing bird.

1206
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:30,036
Oh. That's poetry, Deano.

1207
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:32,709
- Thanks, man.
- Kia ora, bro.

1208
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:45,142
# Marching music

1209
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,277
Oh. Far out.

1210
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,568
Fuck, Deano!

1211
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:01,191
Oi, it's alright,
we've got third-party insurance.

1212
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,865
- We'll just fix it up.
- How's that gonna help?

1213
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:07,410
Just... With insurance,
there's always a way, Nige.

1214
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,534
I'm gonna head back to town
and see Monz.

1215
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:14,084
Yeah? That's a fuckin' great idea,
soldier.

1216
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:17,003
Yeah, get on the main drag
and straight back to town, alright?

1217
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,126
Don't look back.
I'll take care of Gav, yeah?

1218
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,673
- Yeah.
- Alright.

1219
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:23,548
Hey, Nige.
Are you coming to the lighthouse?

1220
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,140
Uh, no.

1221
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,146
- You're gonna love the lighthouse, Gav.
- Yeah?

1222
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,980
Yeah. It's so big up close.

1223
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,545
Oh, fuck...

1224
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,597
G'day, Nige.

1225
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,687
- Hey, Des.
- Thought it was you.

1226
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,271
How's your mum?

1227
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,357
Oh, she's good. Yeah.

1228
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,271
Good. Good.

1229
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,315
Mind if I hop in?

1230
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,188
That door's fucked.

1231
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,908
Uh... Vandals have
smashed the whole thing up.

1232
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:27,577
Vandals, eh?

1233
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,321
I'll hop in the back.

1234
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:39,089
So, here's the thing, Nige.

1235
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:42,425
Um... have you read the newspapers?

1236
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,044
No.

1237
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:47,048
Oh!
Catlins is hitting the news, big-time.

1238
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,050
- Is it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1239
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:53,100
So... I don't want you
to take this the wrong way, Nige,

1240
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,848
but it's just,
uh, something I've got to do.

1241
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,599
Eh?

1242
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,943
Ask you a few questions.

1243
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,703
What are you doing here? In the Catlins?

1244
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,207
Showing a mate around.

1245
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,748
Oh, yeah. Where you been?

1246
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:21,465
Uh... Slope Point, petrified forest...

1247
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:24,255
...uh... dolphins.

1248
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,753
- Blowhole?
- Eh?

1249
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,926
Did you show him the blowhole?

1250
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,549
Ah...

1251
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:33,226
No.

1252
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:37,143
You know, Nige - you shouldn't be
driving this thing around.

1253
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,186
You shouldn't have it on the road.

1254
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,810
How else am I supposed to
get it to the garage, Des?

1255
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:51,908
Hey, Nige. I'll need your keys.

1256
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:53,576
OK. Yeah.

1257
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,418
Hey, Des.

1258
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,132
Yeah, Nige?

1259
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:10,547
Thanks for the tow.

1260
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,057
Oh, one other thing, Nige.

1261
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:25,358
I'm looking for a big Maori guy,
drives a two-toned blue van.

1262
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:27,321
You haven't seen him round, have you?

1263
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,405
No.

1264
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,332
Gav.

1265
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,465
Aghhh!

1266
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,612
Yeah, you've actually got to
get right up close to appreciate it.

1267
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,405
- It's amazing.
Oh, cool.

1268
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:21,539
Whoa! Whoa! How about this wind?

1269
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,377
Yeah, it's pretty windy, eh?

1270
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,212
Ohh!

1271
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:27,003
- Crazy, huh?
- Oh, yeah!

1272
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:30,093
It's nice to know
that Gav's life is about the journey

1273
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:31,632
and not the final goal.

1274
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,302
'Cause it means that
whenever his life may be cut short,

1275
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,551
it's always gonna happen at the time
that he's at peace with himself.

1276
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,598
- We should climb over.
- Yeah?

1277
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:41,312
Yeah. Get a better view.

1278
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:45,605
Believe it or not,
I've just pulled off a masterstroke.

1279
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:48,069
You can't see anything from back there!
Come on!

1280
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:52,191
Because today
is no ordinary day of Gav's life.

1281
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:55,035
This is the day
when Gav cheated probability.

1282
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:58,747
This is the day when Gav
felt like an absolute legend.

1283
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:08,875
And I think to myself,
'Is this the moment? '

1284
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:10,466
Agh!

1285
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,756
No. No.

1286
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,255
Something seems ungentlemanly about it.

1287
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:17,223
Whoa!

1288
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,559
Cher, bro.

1289
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:27,059
Fuck, Gav's awesome. What he's doing
actually takes a shitload of balls.

1290
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:28,901
He's far gutsier than I realised.

1291
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,112
Aghh! Can you feel the fear?

1292
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:34,233
- Eh?
- Can you feel the fear?

1293
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:35,780
Oh, yeah.

1294
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:39,780
- Fuck, yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

1295
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,577
Fuck, yeah!

1296
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:54,969
You're a great guy, Gav!

1297
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:57,259
You're a great guy too, Deano!

1298
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,179
Hey, this has been an awesome day!

1299
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:02,177
Kia ora, bro!

1300
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,811
Yeah. Kia ora, Gav.

1301
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,356
Agh... Aghhh!

1302
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,660
- Nooo!
- Nige!

1303
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,325
Gav!

1304
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,369
What are you doing?
Gav!

1305
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:25,082
Gav!

1306
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,873
It's alright! Calm down!
- Help!

1307
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,872
- He's alive!
- Nah, it's a bird!

1308
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,124
- Help!
- It's a bird.

1309
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:35,127
It's a squawk, mate.
Gav doesn't squawk.

1310
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:36,753
It's Gav!

1311
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,596
You tried to kill Gav!

1312
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,182
Fuckin' calm down!

1313
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:43,097
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1314
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:45,686
You're fuckin' mental! Calm down!

1315
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,100
Oh!

1316
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:53,983
Aargghhhh!

1317
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,086
Aghhh!

1318
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:17,177
You know when you do
something on the spur of the moment

1319
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,920
and then a moment later, you think,

1320
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:21,548
'Ugh, probably shouldn't
have done that'?

1321
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:24,266
Yeah. Well, this was one of those times.

1322
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,181
Aghhh!

1323
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,770
Nige!

1324
01:31:27,774 --> 01:31:30,481
It was a fucking bird!

1325
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:36,442
It was a fucking bird!

1326
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:41,034
You know, Nige's mum
used to say, when I got us in trouble,

1327
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:45,406
'Oh, what if Deano jumped off a cliff,
would you jump off too? '

1328
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:50,002
Well, Nige, if you jump off a cliff,
then so do I.

1329
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:53,714
And when I hit the bottom and we both
make it to the next life or whatever,

1330
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:56,504
I'll be your best fuckin' friend
in that one too.

1331
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,547
Aghhhh!

1332
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:03,552
Fuck!

1333
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:06,027
Hey, Deano. Am I dead?

1334
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,412
Nige!

1335
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:14,536
No, you're not dead, Nige.

1336
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:19,215
Oh, Gav. Gav's OK?

1337
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,927
Yeah, he's fine.
He's halfway up the cliff over there.

1338
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,013
Fuckin' lighter.

1339
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,224
Where's my Playboy lighter?

1340
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:31,095
Hey!

1341
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,185
Hey!

1342
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,433
They can't hear you, Nige.
They wear headsets.

1343
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,150
Yahhh!

1344
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:40,395
We're over here!

1345
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:42,613
Nige. They know we're here.

1346
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,482
That's not what
you should be worried about.

1347
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:47,782
What you should be worried about is
the fact that that's a police chopper.

1348
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:50,451
Woo- ooo, woo-ooo!
You know, the cops?

1349
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,699
Bet they're real keen
to hear your story.

1350
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,575
What are you gonna tell 'em?

1351
01:33:56,256 --> 01:33:58,042
You're fucked.

1352
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:01,925
See, the thing is...
I could help you, though.

1353
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:03,919
I could make it go away like that.

1354
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,261
- Eh?
- Yeah, that's right.

1355
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,846
I know you think my plans are shit.

1356
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,761
But I've got a plan
to get you out of this.

1357
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:10,429
And it's a pretty fuckin' good one.

1358
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:12,017
But why should I?

1359
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:14,808
Why should I even bother, Nige?

1360
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:19,275
I could've not got involved in this.
Life would've been sweet as for me.

1361
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,861
But I did.
I did it without thinking.

1362
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:25,319
You know why?

1363
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:26,941
Oi.

1364
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:31,116
You know why, Nige?

1365
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:34,582
'Cause I'd take a bullet for you.

1366
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:37,328
Like, literally. Think about that.

1367
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,795
If someone shot a gun at you...

1368
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:44,585
...I'd stand in front of the path
and I would take the bullet...

1369
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,006
...in my heart.

1370
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:54,348
But would you take a bullet for me?

1371
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:00,938
Here we go! Yeah!

1372
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:43,192
Yeah, I would.

1373
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:45,278
What?

1374
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:46,942
You'd take a bullet for me?

1375
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,328
Fuck, man... you're my best friend.

1376
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,533
My brother.

1377
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:00,876
I wouldn't even have to think
about it.

1378
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,464
I'd just... Take a bullet.

1379
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:06,298
Of course I would.

1380
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,146
Fuck, yeah.

1381
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:24,605
# If you need somebody
# Free, free, set them free

1382
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:28,901
# Call my name
# Free, free, set them free

1383
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:32,025
# And if you want someone #
# Free, free, set them free #

1384
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:33,367
Oi.

1385
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,407
Nige.

1386
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:40,034
# If you want to keep something precious
# Free, free, set them free

1387
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:43,002
# You got to lock it up
and throw away the key

1388
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:47,796
# If you want to hold on
to your possession

1389
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:51,511
# Don't even think about me
# Free, free, set them free

1390
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:55,598
# If you love somebody
# Love somebody

1391
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:59,640
# If you love someone
# Love somebody

1392
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:03,560
# If you love somebody
# Love somebody

1393
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,729
# If you love someone #
# Love somebody #

1394
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,568
It's gonna be alright, Nige.

1395
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:10,564
Now listen, here's what
we tell the cops, alright?

1396
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:11,860
I'll do the talking.

1397
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:19,205
Isn't it amazing? It's mad!

1398
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:22,792
# If you love somebody
# Love somebody

1399
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:26,458
# If you love someone
# Love somebody

1400
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:30,459
# If you love somebody
# Love somebody

1401
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:35,464
# If you love someone
Set them free

1402
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:37,261
# Oh, yeah

1403
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:41,887
# Set them free
# Free, free, set them free

1404
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:45,982
# Oh, set them free
# Free, free, set them free

1405
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,476
# Free, free, set them free #

1406
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:52,151
It may not look like I've come that far
since that night when I killed Jeurgen,

1407
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:54,240
but I reckon I've come a long way.

1408
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,202
In a weird way, I can thank Deano.

1409
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,573
He was amazing with the cops.

1410
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:04,701
He told them he tried to kill Gav,
he told them he ran over Jeurgen.

1411
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:07,579
And all I have to do is visit him
once a week in prison.

1412
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:09,376
Here she is.

1413
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:11,875
Pfft! Looks like you're the mayor
of Dorksville!

1414
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,002
Which is fair enough
when you think about it.

1415
01:38:14,013 --> 01:38:16,925
You know, 15 years from now,
I'm out.

1416
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:18,719
We're back flatting together.

1417
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:21,475
It's gonna be classic.

1418
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:24,596
Oi, Nige...

1419
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,268
Come here.

1420
01:38:26,275 --> 01:38:27,856
Ow!

1421
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:31,318
Fuck your face.

1422
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:33,779
I've never seen him happier.

1423
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:37,116
Prison has been the best thing
for Deano.

1424
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:46,497
Deano doesn't know this,
but I'm still hanging out with Gav.

1425
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:49,166
Gav quit his security job
and used his compo payout

1426
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:51,164
to write a book
about his close encounters

1427
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:52,711
with wildlife in the Catlins.

1428
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,881
This one is called
The Reluctant Dolphin.

1429
01:38:57,306 --> 01:39:01,140
'The brave little dolphin felt
the powerful thighs of the warrior

1430
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:02,680
around his flippers.

1431
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:04,518
On him he made it to the shore.

1432
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:08,811
He blessed the dolphin and renamed him
Tangaroa, god of the sea. '

1433
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:18,191
Monica and I are having
an on-again, off-again relationship

1434
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:22,070
that is becoming more like
an off-again, off-again

1435
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:24,367
with an occasional root.

1436
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:28,960
The thing is with women, Nige,
is you have to empathise with them.

1437
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:32,126
Like, when a woman has her period,
you know what you should do?

1438
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:35,466
You should imagine punching yourself
in the balls.

1439
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:39,679
That way, you can know what kind of pain
she's going through, you know.

1440
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:43,220
Yeah. Good one, Gav.

1441
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:44,512
You're welcome, bro.

1442
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:58,106
Nige.

1443
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,574
Are you OK, Nige?

1444
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:03,536
Oooh. Yeah.

1445
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:06,121
Gav gives such great advice.

1446
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,992
At the moment, I'm in a lot of pain.

1447
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:11,210
But it's worth it for moments like this.

1448
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,925
And me, I've changed so much

1449
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:24,094
it's like I've had my head gasket
replaced.

1450
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:27,260
Now I've got a whole different reason

1451
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,307
for doing laps
in the middle of the night.

1452
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,316
His name's Jace the Ace.

1453
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,151
I can't wait till he's a bit older

1454
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:39,522
and me and Gav can take him
for adventures to far-flung places

1455
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:42,901
like Dunedin and the North Island
and that.

1456
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:44,152
Jace!

1457
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,620
Oopsies.

1458
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:57,293
Nige, look. Look!

1459
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,417
Whoa.

1460
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:03,929
I'm flying, Gav!

1461
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,972
- Yeah, Nige!
- Woo-hoo-hoo!

1462
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:10,220
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!

1463
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:12,938
# Don't know where to turn

1464
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,479
# I'm gonna drift into that void

1465
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:17,727
# I'm flying through space
I'm an asteroid

1466
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,354
# Time doesn't take place
when you're paranoid

1467
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:23,654
# I'm thinking about you
and nothing else

1468
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:26,368
# Thinking about you,
you're thinking about me

1469
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:28,863
# Thinking about you,
I'm counting the beat

1470
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,867
# Thinking about you
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

1471
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:35,494
# Thinking about me
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

1472
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:37,588
# Thinking about just you and me

1473
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:41,255
# La da de de
There ain't no place I'd rather be

1474
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:46,893
# La da de da, la da de da, la da de da,
la da de da

1475
01:41:55,901 --> 01:41:58,267
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1476
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,028
# I'm bleeding to death

1477
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:03,148
# On a cloudless day

1478
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:06,158
# A three, a four heartbeat

1479
01:42:06,162 --> 01:42:08,494
# A waltzin' away

1480
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:13,668
# Oooh ooh, oo oo

1481
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:21,541
# I'm counting the beat
2, 3, 4, 5

1482
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:24,168
# I'm feeling the heat to be alive

1483
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:26,546
# I'm counting the beat
6, 7, 8, 9

1484
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,388
# I'm wishing that you

1485
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:30,223
# That you were mine

1486
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,889
# Thinking about you,
you're thinking about me

1487
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:35,263
# Thinking about you
and counting the beat

1488
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:38,391

# Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

1489

1499
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:51,347
# Hello, my friend

1500
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:55,889
# It's morning, time to wake now

1501
01:43:55,896 --> 01:44:00,358
# Your body and mine
entwined will have to break now

1502
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:07,108
# I want your flesh,
your warmth to stay beside me

1503
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:14,910
# Oh, how I wish
you could be deep inside me

1504
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:20,879
# Show me your eyes,
your love, most tender feeling

1505
01:44:22,882 --> 01:44:27,969
# And I'll give you mine,
be truthful and revealing

1506
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:32,088
# 'Cause it's you that I love
And it's true that I love

1507
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:35,557
# It's love not given lightly

And it's you that I love

I cannot always face you

1511
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:56,328
# Maybe my mood
won't let these arms embrace you

1512
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:03,547
# That doesn't mean
my love's somehow diminished
