1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:03,103
Andre and Spindle-shanks
are having an intimate relationship.

2
00:00:03,107 --> 00:00:04,460
<i>Voila.</i>

3
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:06,583
Have you any objection?

4
00:00:06,747 --> 00:00:08,658
Who, me?
No, none at all.

5
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:12,425
Have you told him
the other thing,

6
00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:13,986
the most important?

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,786
-No, he hasn't.
-What's the other thing?

8
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:19,302
The other thing
is that I'm pregnant.

9
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:22,260
-What?
-We're going to have a baby.

10
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:25,944
Is that possible?

11
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:29,099
Of course! It's normal,
isn't it, Mr. Armand?

12
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:32,057
Well, yes, it is, because

13
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:33,785
if you and he...

14
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,385
What a mess, Andres.

15
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:39,659
Don't be afraid.
It's not your responsibility.

16
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:41,818
I'm not asking for anything.

17
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:44,182
You can go to Murcia
whenever you want.

18
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:47,066
-Right now.
-Ninette, it's not that.

19
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:48,832
In that case,

20
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:50,392
take off the bandage

21
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:54,432
and put on your jacket
and the tie with polka dots.

22
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:57,228
I'm going to show you Paris.

23
00:00:58,113 --> 00:00:59,785
We'll walk by the Seine,

24
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,991
<i>we'll have dinner
on the damn bateau-mouche,</i>

25
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:04,586
we'll go to the Louvre

26
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,545
and at night

27
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,749
to the Moulin Rouge.

28
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:10,469
<i>Ca va?</i>

29
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,062
<i>Ca va.</i>

30
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:31,423
<i>Allez.</i>

31
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:58,152
<i>-Bonjour, Mme. Bernarda.
-Bonjour, Mr. Armand.</i>

32
00:01:58,313 --> 00:02:00,463
<i>-Bonjour, Mr. Pierre.
-Bonjour.</i>

33
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:04,148
Andres is feeling much better,
we thought we'd go out for while.

34
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:07,544
No, you can't leave here.

35
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:09,385
-No?
-No.

36
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:13,070
Hello, dad. Hello, mom.

37
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,268
Hello, Ninette.

38
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,663
Why aren't you at work?

39
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,425
Haven't you heard the news?

40
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:21,061
No, I was going to take
Mr. Martinez to the Louvre.

41
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,303
The Louvre? Forget it.

42
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:24,986
Good morning.

43
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:27,552
It's a miracle!

44
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:30,227
Mr. Martinez isn't limping.
He's cured.

45
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:34,147
Armando brought me
a special ointment.

46
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:37,908
I put it on and that fixed it.
I don't even need the bandage.

47
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:41,782
I heard you say
we can't go out. Why?

48
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,028
<i>C'est la greve.</i>

49
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:45,626
<i>La greve.</i>

50
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:47,431
<i>-Ah, la greve.
-La what?</i>

51
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:49,584
<i>La greve.
The general strike.</i>

52
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,790
No one thought
it could actually happen.

53
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,272
Oh, no?

54
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,871
This isn't Spain.

55
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:00,424
Electricity, gas, theaters,
transport, the mail,

56
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:01,389
<i>tous fermes.</i>

57
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:05,910
<i>No taxis, no subway, no stores,
no cafes, rien de rien.</i>

58
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:08,268
That's why you shouldn't go out.
It isn't worth it.

59
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:12,346
-Aren't the river boats working?
-No, they're not.

60
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:16,866
I rang a group of Spanish friends,
republicans like us,

61
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,707
and they're coming here.

62
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,023
I've bought "chorizo"
and "salchichon"

63
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:23,070
so we can have some proper food.

64
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:26,031
We're going to have
a wonderful afternoon.

65
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,388
And I'll play the pipes.

66
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:31,904
Dad, mom,

67
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,712
I'm pregnant.

68
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:38,024
<i>By whom, ma cherie?</i>

69
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:39,831
By Mr. Martinez.

70
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:41,982
Did you hear that?

71
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:44,747
Yes, she's pregnant
by Mr. Martinez.

72
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,822
I'm going to prepare the food.

73
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,746
-Mr. Pierre...
-Yes?

74
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:56,904
You're an admirable man.

75
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:59,226
I really mean that.

76
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:00,223
You think so?

77
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:01,621
Absolutely.

78
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:03,829
And very European.

79
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,461
You mean because of Ninette's joke?

80
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:08,589
I'm used to it
and I prefer that

81
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:11,631
to having her
reading novels all day.

82
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,786
-Dad...
-Yes?

83
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,064
It isn't a joke.

84
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:17,382
No?

85
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:19,191
This time it's true.

86
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,503
I'm pregnant by Mr. Martinez.

87
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:27,062
Are you saying
that this gentleman,

88
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,225
-in my own house, dared to...
-I let him.

89
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:32,953
We did what's natural
between a man and a woman.

90
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:36,150
-I can explain...
-Be quiet! And sit down!

91
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,585
Don't say a word!

92
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:40,748
Bernarda.

93
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:43,701
I heard everything.

94
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:46,706
Child, is that what
you call reading?

95
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,424
And what do you have to say?

96
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:51,946
-Me?
-Yes, you.

97
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:56,152
It's your fault, you brought
that scoundrel here.

98
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:57,587
Be quiet!

99
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,503
<i>-Ninette, assieds-toi.
-Dad...</i>

100
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:03,265
<i>Assieds-toi!</i>

101
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,903
Now, listen carefully.

102
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:13,621
We're all going to talk
man to man,

103
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,666
and very clearly.

104
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:18,669
What I'm going to ask

105
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,232
is very simple.

106
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,225
<i>Quel horreur!</i>

107
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:38,748
I don't believe it!

108
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,745
It's always the same.

109
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:43,950
Why don't you Scots fuck off?

110
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:46,991
We're sick of your music!

111
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,232
<i>Merde!</i>

112
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:09,829
MURCIA, A YEAR LATER

113
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,988
You said the minimum order
was 50, right?

114
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:42,189
No, it's not 50, it's 100.

115
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:44,264
I told you that, 100.

116
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,265
Are you deaf or what?

117
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:50,787
If I were only to print one,
Which would you recommend?

118
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,706
The ones with the gold border
or the ones with the lamb?

119
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,943
My niece Turitas
is making her Communion.

120
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,422
Her real name is Virtudes,
Virtuditas,

121
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:01,551
but we call her Turitas,
and as I'm studying...

122
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,783
Don't tell me your life story.

123
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:08,582
Both the Good Shepherd
and the Dove are very popular

124
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:11,904
and the price difference
is very slight.

125
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:13,392
In favor of which?

126
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:15,623
The ones with the gold border
are cheaper.

127
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:18,227
100, with gold borders,
for Tortitas...

128
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:20,509
-Turitas.
-Well, whatever,

129
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,107
they're 25 pesetas less
than the Good Shepherd.

130
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,547
I'll have those.

131
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:27,750
And little girls love gold trimming,
don't they?

132
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:31,701
I don't know about Torootas,
but today little girls like Elvis.

133
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:52,028
Sunbathing in the nude again?

134
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,349
-First, I'm not in the nude.
-No?

135
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:56,902
No, and second,
sunbathing is very healthy.

136
00:07:57,073 --> 00:07:58,950
With the windows open.

137
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:02,469
Of course, darling. It's bad
to sunbathe through glass.

138
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,306
And you lose ultraviolet radiation.

139
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:07,543
Leave that, I'll tidy up later.

140
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:10,389
Look, when I lived on my own

141
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:12,828
Melchora had the house
clean and tidy.

142
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,144
Why isn't it like that now?
Because your mother fired her.

143
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:17,871
They didn't get on well.

144
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:21,946
Mom never wanted servants.
She prefers to do it all herself.

145
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:24,673
To do it all herself, badly,
you mean.

146
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,426
Dad's shoes.

147
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:36,271
Andres! When the windows
are open it's cooler!

148
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,947
Yeah, and the view's better
from the barracks,

149
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:42,389
especially for that captain
with his field glasses.

150
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:43,906
Stop exaggerating.

151
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:46,348
Exaggerating?
What about your mole?

152
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,469
<i>-He's told the whole club.
-Quoi?</i>

153
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:49,907
The mole you have there.

154
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:53,270
Who told that captain
about your mole?

155
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:19,945
You know what it is?

156
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,547
At first, you let me work
in the store.

157
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,749
<i>We put up the sign
''On parle francais",</i>

158
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:27,427
the tourists came,
I spoke to them in their language...

159
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:29,948
You flirted with all the customers.

160
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:31,546
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

161
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,988
In one month,
you sold 540 catechisms.

162
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:37,429
That's never happened in Murcia,
not even during Lent!

163
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:38,867
Yes, Maruja?

164
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:42,341
The manager says
can you go to the printer's,

165
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:44,868
something's happened
with that gadget.

166
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,467
He told you already
but you didn't listen

167
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:48,827
and now what'll they do?

168
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:51,826
Tell him I'm on my way
and not to touch the Minerva.

169
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:53,392
Well, hurry up. You know him.

170
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:56,306
He'll get nervous
and screw everything.

171
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:05,350
Say what you like,
I was useful in the store.

172
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:08,585
-You needed an assistant.
-That's why I got her.

173
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,948
But Maruja doesn't speak French.

174
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:13,024
And she's common and unfriendly.

175
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:15,104
That's what you need in a store.

176
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:17,468
Someone unfriendly
who doesn't chat.

177
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:18,986
"A catechism?
Here's a catechism."

178
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,030
"-Haven't you got another?"
"-No."

179
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:21,943
"Got a St. Damian?"

180
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:23,910
"Yes, here's one.
Pay up and go away."

181
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:26,109
I don't want us to get angry.

182
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:27,626
But it's not fair.

183
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,387
You don't let me do anything
and I'm bored.

184
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,583
If you had real children,

185
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:37,586
not imaginary ones,
you wouldn't be so bored.

186
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,949
It was a utopian pregnancy,

187
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:44,350
psychic, emotional.

188
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:46,147
The doctors explained it.

189
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:50,388
Yes, they explained it
three months after we got married.

190
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:54,113
I really thought I was pregnant.

191
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:57,392
You know that what I'd like most
is for us to have a baby.

192
00:10:57,793 --> 00:11:00,751
Yes. A boy, blonde, blue eyes,

193
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:03,427
who weighs exactly
3 kilos 400 grams at birth.

194
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:04,946
And for that we have to...?

195
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:07,673
Wait for Cancer to be
in conjunction with Saturn

196
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,631
so the baby is born
under the protection of Jupiter,

197
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,785
-the most favourable planet.
-And... well...

198
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:17,343
You can laugh, but you know
nothing about astrology.

199
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:20,105
-I'm going out.
-Where?

200
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:22,867
I have to do an errand
for Dona Remedios.

201
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,624
When's your mother coming?

202
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,431
In a few days.

203
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,864
Good afternoon, Maruja.

204
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:37,786
-Good afternoon.
-What are you doing?

205
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:41,187
Labelling rosaries, can't you see?

206
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,744
-Hot, isn't it?
-lf you say so.

207
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,302
-No, that's how it is.
-Then that's how it is.

208
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,862
Like I say,
that's what it is about spring.

209
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,024
I don't know what it is about spring.

210
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:53,626
It stirs the blood.

211
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,952
It stirs the blood
because the heat begins.

212
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:04,105
Spring is the start of summer,
and in summer, you know.

213
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:06,621
I know what?

214
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,910
It's warmer than winter.
Where's Don Andres?

215
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:11,742
Upstairs?

216
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:16,028
Balancing those whatsits.

217
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,106
No, no, forget it.

218
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:37,222
Maruja,

219
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:40,223
<i>what color is your soutien-gorge?</i>

220
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:44,141
<i>-My what?
-And your petite culotte?</i>

221
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:48,672
What color is your underwear?

222
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,030
What a nerve!

223
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:54,392
Go upstairs. Go on.

224
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:56,546
Good God!

225
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:05,862
Hello.

226
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,108
Hello.

227
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:10,502
-What are you doing?
-You can see.

228
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:13,466
How's business?

229
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,544
-Bad.
-Why's that?

230
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:18,504
My in-laws won't go to Mass,

231
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,062
they've kept their ideas
and my customers know it.

232
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,508
When Pierre played
the "International" on the pipes

233
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:25,789
the police were here
in five minutes.

234
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:26,829
And?

235
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:28,585
They took the pipes away.

236
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:30,311
Why are you here?

237
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:33,989
Mr. Pierre invited me to supper
again, as Mme. Bernarda is in Madrid,

238
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:35,791
to talk about France,

239
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:38,023
<i>creme de tomate,
omelette au fromage,</i>

240
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,785
<i>rognon de veau saute....</i>

241
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,787
Our French cooking.
I've brought him dessert.

242
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,672
Yeah, take the Camembert
into the kitchen.

243
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,791
-How do you know what it is?
-How do you think?

244
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,425
Since they transferred you here,

245
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:54,948
you spend more time in my house
than in yours.

246
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:58,947
That's because your family like me,
they're nice and they invite me.

247
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:01,149
It seems to bother you.

248
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,222
-Where's Ninette?
-She's gone out.

249
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:06,382
Where?

250
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,790
On an errand for her mother and...

251
00:14:08,953 --> 00:14:11,183
Why do you care where my wife is?

252
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:17,661
That wealthy Dona Remedios
and your mother-in-law

253
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,347
are up to something.
It's very odd.

254
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:24,308
It's the third time they've gone
to Madrid in two months, isn't it?

255
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,988
-Don Andres!
-Yes, Maruja?

256
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:30,390
They've come for that thingy
for something or other.

257
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:31,702
-Ah, the check!
-Yes.

258
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:34,626
It's in the top drawer
of the writing desk.

259
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:36,784
Tell the supplier
to sign the receipt.

260
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:37,942
All right.

261
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:42,148
"They've come for that thingy
for something or other."

262
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:44,383
And you know what it is.

263
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:47,302
You're smarter than I thought.

264
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:50,432
By the way, that Maruja...

265
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,425
How can she be so unfriendly?

266
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,187
She's not unfriendly.
She's decent.

267
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,505
Maruja, it's gone 8:00.

268
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:40,345
I'm just finishing.

269
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:44,028
Be careful you don't fall.

270
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:46,512
I'm used to it.

271
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:04,904
Is anything wrong?

272
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:12,032
Are you all right?

273
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,662
Yes, there's nothing wrong.

274
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:30,632
Maru, has the Archangel Gabriel
arrived yet?

275
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,030
Yes, Don Andres, he's right there,

276
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:37,785
on the table.

277
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:40,345
You know what, Maru?

278
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,069
Right now, in the store,
there are only the three of us.

279
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:47,830
You, the Archangel Gabriel and me.

280
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:51,673
And the Archangel
is made of plaster.

281
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,710
He doesn't feel a thing.

282
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,669
You understand, Maru?

283
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,502
Yes.

284
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,346
There are just the three of us

285
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:06,710
and he sees nothing.

286
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,704
Exactly, nothing.

287
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:11,902
You asked if anything was wrong.

288
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:14,344
Yes, something is wrong.

289
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:17,353
You're magnificent, Maru.

290
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:19,669
Magnificent, magnificent.

291
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,869
Don Andres, what will people think?

292
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,830
There's no one here.

293
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,870
What will you think, Don Andres?

294
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:29,825
I don't think, Maru.

295
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,512
Don Andres! Be careful
with the third button, it's loose.

296
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:38,188
How can anyone think
looking at this,

297
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:40,503
and at this mouth that's saying,

298
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:42,982
"Eat me, Andres, eat me".

299
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:46,750
Andres, this is crazy.

300
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:49,950
I'm not French, I'm Spanish,
and very, very Spanish.

301
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:52,024
-What does that matter?
-It doesn't,

302
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:55,151
because I'm very Spanish
and I'm crazy about you.

303
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:57,144
-What?
-Yes, crazy.

304
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:59,224
Don't you know you get me going

305
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:01,509
every time you take off
your workcoat?

306
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:04,426
Sweet Jesus!
What's going to become of us?

307
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:05,787
Holy Virgin!

308
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:24,072
Coming!

309
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:49,262
Who is it?

310
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,467
It's that priest.
He's come to talk to Mr. Pierre.

311
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,464
Don Roque.
Do up your buttons.

312
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,101
-What did you tell him?
-That you...

313
00:18:57,273 --> 00:19:01,186
You were in the basement
and I was doing those account things.

314
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:03,025
They're called delivery notes.

315
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:04,945
My father-in-law is out.

316
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,592
Tell Don Roque
to come back in an hour.

317
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:09,631
No, Mr. Pierre is here.
He went up the main stairs.

318
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:12,148
He's all twitter-twitter
with the birds.

319
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:14,747
He's here?
He could have caught us!

320
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:16,631
This is very dangerous.

321
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:18,943
We should rent an apartment.

322
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:20,148
Are you crazy?

323
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:22,986
In my name,
you won't appear anywhere.

324
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:24,745
I rent it, you pay for it.

325
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,585
On the outskirts.

326
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,983
Now, go on, he's waiting for you.

327
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:32,190
Hey! Why does that priest
want to see your father-in-law?

328
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:35,026
He's called Don Roque
and don't grab on to me.

329
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:37,184
To get him to go to church,
of course!

330
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:38,502
I've told him,

331
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:41,267
"Go to Mass!
Is that so hard to do?"

332
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:44,664
Don Roque, you're welcome!
Feel right at home.

333
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,587
Thank you, my boy.
You feel right at home too.

334
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:51,347
-How are all the family?
-They're all fine, thank you.

335
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:54,027
-I'm delighted to hear that.
-Go on up.

336
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,069
Thank you.

337
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:59,507
You married my daughter,
didn't you?

338
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:02,506
No, Fr. Rebolledo married
your daughter.

339
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:03,947
Rebolledo?

340
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:07,510
Forgive my mistake,

341
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:10,185
but all of you go round

342
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:12,583
dressed up in the same uniform.

343
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,789
Here we go.

344
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,589
Well, what do you want?

345
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:21,102
I know you're very anti-clerical,

346
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:25,264
but even so I've come to ask you
for a recommendation.

347
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,502
For Paris?

348
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:29,426
No, not for Paris,
for here, for Murcia.

349
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:30,662
Tell me.

350
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:33,308
Well, I've got a godson,

351
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:36,432
very smart, 20 years old, Alfonsito,

352
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:40,142
who doesn't want
to continue studying law.

353
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:44,910
I wanted to get him
into the garage where you work.

354
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,028
As a mechanic?

355
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:47,751
No, in the office.

356
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,063
I could ask Frutos, the union rep,

357
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:52,383
but he's always putting me off.

358
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,066
So I prefer to ask you,

359
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,951
among other reasons

360
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:58,422
because you've become
the master there, right?

361
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:00,028
No, I haven't.

362
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,749
The masters are the masters.

363
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,585
They respect me, that's all.

364
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:07,142
"They respect you."
Don't be so humble.

365
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:11,067
In the Confianza Garage
what Mr. Pierre says is gospel.

366
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:14,270
You mightn't read it,
but your word is gospel.

367
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:18,187
Having been out of Spain
for a long time

368
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:20,867
and being on the wrong side,

369
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:23,907
my friend, that's a great thing.

370
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:26,713
But people are so used
to seeing us

371
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:28,864
and we've asked so many favors,

372
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,747
that nobody pays us
a blind bit of notice,

373
00:21:31,913 --> 00:21:33,028
and that's the truth.

374
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:36,742
Apart from all that,
you've done a lot of silly things.

375
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:39,748
I mean, giving Franco,

376
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:42,143
for us, "the little commander",

377
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:45,346
a royal welcome into the churches.

378
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,548
Come on!

379
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:49,671
Well, the stupidities you commit
behind the Iron Curtain

380
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,425
are considerable too.

381
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:53,302
Father,

382
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:56,590
do you want me to get
your godson a job or not?

383
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:57,909
Of course.

384
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,544
You've done a lot of silly things,

385
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:02,271
end of story.

386
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:07,989
Send Alfonsito to the office
on Monday, at 9:00.

387
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:10,231
I'll see what I can do.

388
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:12,543
I really appreciate that.

389
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,822
Well, Mr. Pierre,
I won't bother you anymore.

390
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:18,665
No, no, I'll go with you.

391
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,711
I'm going to the newspaper stall
for "L'Humanite",

392
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,864
the newspaper I subscribe to.

393
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:27,105
What the Church sends me,
without being subscribed,

394
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:28,592
is the "Workers' World",

395
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:31,187
and recently it's very good.

396
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:33,108
Very good!

397
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:47,222
Andre...

398
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:48,628
What?

399
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,186
Mom's opening a business.

400
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,105
So that's it.

401
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,104
What is it, a doughnut stand?

402
00:22:57,673 --> 00:23:00,585
Mom's become good friends
with Dona Remedios.

403
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,549
Something I don't understand.

404
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:04,668
I'll explain it.

405
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,109
Dona Remedios has been
a vegetarian for thirty years.

406
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:10,150
She won't even taste a chop.

407
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:11,587
Like crickets.

408
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:15,183
She happened to meet mom

409
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,423
and mom gave her
an address in France

410
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,663
where she could order
some weeds or other,

411
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,744
and she advises her
about vegetables.

412
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:24,222
Anyway, they've become
great friends

413
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:26,987
and between them
they're going to open a boutique.

414
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:28,222
A what?

415
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:29,826
A fashion store.

416
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:33,227
Beside the Plateria,
in the best area.

417
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:35,907
With the way she looks,
your mother is opening

418
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:38,428
a fashion store?
Have we all gone mad?

419
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:40,948
She won't be selling her dresses.

420
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:44,105
They'll be ones she's ordered
from Paris and Madrid.

421
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:47,231
And it won't be just dresses.
There'll be underwear,

422
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,782
<i>nightdresses,
jupons, porte-jarretelles....</i>

423
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:51,227
Porta-what?

424
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:52,702
Garters.

425
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,191
The thing you used to wear.

426
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:57,868
Well,

427
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:01,264
mom won't be the only one
working with Dona Remedios.

428
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,148
I'm going to help.

429
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,109
Not a chance.

430
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:21,583
You selling panties and briefs
to all the sex maniacs in town?

431
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,187
-Forget it.
-It's been decided.

432
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,312
Decided?

433
00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:27,508
Yes.

434
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,267
Another thing, the store
will be called "Ninette"

435
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,549
<i>and underneath
"Modes de Paris''.</i>

436
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:36,704
Are you saying my wife's name

437
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:38,750
will be displayed in a street?

438
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:40,427
Yes, Andres.

439
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,866
I say it won't.

440
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,782
I say it will. It's done.

441
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:35,581
When are you going to open?

442
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:39,622
I don't know.
In a few weeks.

443
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,148
The painters are in at the minute.

444
00:25:42,313 --> 00:25:43,268
Why?

445
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:47,702
Because you'll be in the store
most of the day.

446
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:51,911
Don't forget that I'm used...

447
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:56,307
I was used to working
and I get depressed doing nothing.

448
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,508
You know that.

449
00:25:57,673 --> 00:26:00,949
No, in theory, I don't think
it's a bad idea.

450
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:04,106
And I can't demand that you stay
in the house all day.

451
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:05,706
That's obvious.

452
00:26:07,073 --> 00:26:08,392
Well, then?

453
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:11,304
I don't know.

454
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:15,742
If you want that maid to come back,

455
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:19,030
I'll persuade mom that Melchora
is essential for you.

456
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:22,868
I don't need anyone in the house.
It'll be more peaceful.

457
00:26:25,713 --> 00:26:26,907
<i>Mon amour.</i>

458
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:31,269
I'm going to love you
much, much more.

459
00:26:40,153 --> 00:26:41,142
The light.

460
00:26:47,513 --> 00:26:50,550
Listen, the name Ninette
in modern letters.

461
00:26:50,713 --> 00:26:52,431
Nothing gothic or English.

462
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,182
<i>D'accord.</i>

463
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:12,582
ARTILLERY BARRACKS

464
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:33,184
I know a real lady shouldn't have

465
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:35,708
eau-de-vie for breakfast, but...

466
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:38,671
<i>But you're not a real lady, cherie.</i>

467
00:27:39,113 --> 00:27:40,341
How was Madrid?

468
00:27:40,513 --> 00:27:42,151
Great, great.

469
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:44,464
By the way, Ninette told me

470
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:46,749
you agree about the boutique.

471
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,750
-Is that true?
-Yes.

472
00:27:50,393 --> 00:27:52,668
After she told me,
I thought about it

473
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,983
and it's just what this city needs.

474
00:27:56,153 --> 00:27:57,745
Think about this, Bernarda.

475
00:27:57,913 --> 00:27:59,904
With your head for business,

476
00:28:00,073 --> 00:28:03,588
I think this idea of Paris fashions
will be a great success,

477
00:28:03,753 --> 00:28:06,426
and the advantage is
if anything should go wrong

478
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:08,948
the one who loses money
is Miss Rabbit-food.

479
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:10,990
That's good thinking.

480
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:14,991
Excuse me, Don Andres...

481
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,222
Yes, Miss Maruja?

482
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:20,831
Nothing, it's...

483
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:25,107
It's 8:55 and I've opened the store.

484
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:28,310
I'm going down to the basement
to count those thingies,

485
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,862
so someone will have to
attend the counter.

486
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,910
Yes, I'll be down now.

487
00:28:33,073 --> 00:28:34,552
You can start the inventory,

488
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,704
and please bring up
the accounts ledgers

489
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,306
and leave them in the back room.

490
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:40,543
No, if you want those big books

491
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:42,624
go and get them yourself.

492
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,385
They're a dead weight

493
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:46,384
and I end up with a sore back.

494
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:48,828
All right, I'll see to it.

495
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,302
You'd think
I was that strongwoman

496
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:53,668
who pulls cars with her teeth.

497
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:55,541
Really!

498
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:05,622
<i>Mais voyons!</i>

499
00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:09,465
<i>Qu'est-ce que c’est que ca?
Isn't she rude?</i>

500
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,669
It's just her character.

501
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,152
Character, my foot!

502
00:29:13,313 --> 00:29:15,827
You can't have someone like that
in the store.

503
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:18,948
You should fire her today.

504
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:21,106
The cheek of her!

505
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:24,390
I can't fire her. There's
a labor ruling that prevents me.

506
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:28,023
-Mr. Pierre, isn't that so?
-According to the legislation,

507
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:31,424
you can't fire a worker
for being unpleasant.

508
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:33,549
Did you hear how she answered him?

509
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:35,226
He has to put up with it.

510
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:37,304
There is a very good law,

511
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:40,670
one of the few things
done well in this country,

512
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:44,430
that defends the worker
against the capitalist boss.

513
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:46,265
In this case, me.

514
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:47,548
<i>Incroyable.</i>

515
00:29:47,713 --> 00:29:50,102
<i>It's incroyable,
but that's how it is.</i>

516
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:52,741
Now, let's go
or we'll be late for work.

517
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:54,187
But first,

518
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:56,625
a toast.

519
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,985
-Why?
-To...

520
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,582
Ninette,

521
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:04,385
"Fashions from Paris".

522
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,022
To Ninette.

523
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:25,828
Are you out of your mind?

524
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:29,386
Forgive me, Andres, I'm sorry.
Don't be angry.

525
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:30,747
You don't think!

526
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:33,473
I got upset when I saw that
your wife was smooching you.

527
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:36,909
Well, you have to put up with it.
That's the problem with these things.

528
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:39,189
I can't put up with things.

529
00:30:39,393 --> 00:30:40,428
Andres,

530
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,312
this thing can't go on like this.

531
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:46,465
Nothing irreparable
has happened between us yet.

532
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:49,670
Yes, but I have a feeling, my love,
it could happen any minute.

533
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:53,712
Yes, well, until it happens,
let's not get tragic.

534
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:56,103
Prepare the prayer books
for the Clarisas,

535
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:57,945
not the thingummy-jigs.

536
00:30:58,113 --> 00:30:59,865
-You know something?
-What?

537
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:01,546
She knows everything.

538
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:03,385
And she's pretending.

539
00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:06,272
Remember, she's French,
you know, brazen.

540
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,663
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

541
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,152
Well, Armando!

542
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:27,464
-Good evening.
-Are you looking for Don Andres?

543
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:28,629
Yes.

544
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,552
Upstairs, in the "bureau"
with those thingies.

545
00:31:32,713 --> 00:31:34,112
The orders.

546
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:38,067
Have you got the time?
My watch has stopped.

547
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:39,302
Yes, of course.

548
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:40,667
It's 8:15.

549
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,222
Almost 8:20.

550
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:46,350
Thank you, you're very kind.

551
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:49,186
Armando, you needn't be so formal.

552
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:56,467
Listen,

553
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,829
-Maruja.
-Yes.

554
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,950
That checked blouse is lovely.

555
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:04,632
Yes, it's new.

556
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:06,511
It looks great on you.

557
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:08,982
I've never worn it before.

558
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:12,142
Listen!

559
00:32:13,313 --> 00:32:15,383
Isn't that a coincidence?

560
00:32:15,553 --> 00:32:17,191
Recreation.

561
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,423
Speaking of recreation,

562
00:32:20,153 --> 00:32:22,064
are you busy tonight?

563
00:32:22,993 --> 00:32:24,551
Maybe I am.

564
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:26,667
Maybe I'm not.

565
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:28,392
It depends.

566
00:32:41,953 --> 00:32:43,068
Armando!

567
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,022
Pink.

568
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,147
Pale pink.

569
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,710
To be honest, I can't complain.

570
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:12,023
Mari Merche is delightful.

571
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:13,945
She's pleasant, polite,

572
00:33:14,113 --> 00:33:17,992
always willing to bring me anything,
a glass of water at night...

573
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,586
And if she has to argue
with her mother because of me,

574
00:33:21,753 --> 00:33:23,584
she does it
and takes my side.

575
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:25,266
-Shit!
-You're lucky!

576
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,025
But I can't stand her.

577
00:33:27,193 --> 00:33:30,265
And what's worse,
I'm getting a thing about her.

578
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:32,071
That's it, that's it.

579
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:34,667
But if she and I weren't married

580
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,188
why would I dislike her like this?

581
00:33:38,353 --> 00:33:42,062
By the way,
we really miss Ninette's coffee.

582
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:46,869
She goes to bed early now,
she's busy at the store.

583
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,666
Poor thing.

584
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,585
Are we playing or not?

585
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:51,862
Cut.

586
00:33:53,513 --> 00:33:54,866
What a pity.

587
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:04,825
It's me, Ninette.

588
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:06,548
<i>Entre.</i>

589
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:11,988
Listen,

590
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:15,870
I wanted to talk to you
before the game finishes.

591
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:17,190
By the way,

592
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:19,105
they haven't played for ages.

593
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:20,991
They only meet once a month.

594
00:34:21,153 --> 00:34:23,428
-Why?
-You know Andres.

595
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:25,788
He said that his friends
only came to see me,

596
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:29,070
that they never used to get
dressed up to play cards,

597
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,430
that they wear lots of cologne
and the store stinks afterwards.

598
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:33,423
Listen,

599
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:36,825
I still think we have to fire
that Maruja.

600
00:34:37,313 --> 00:34:39,383
It's my maternal instinct.

601
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:41,987
Mom, if Andres is flirting
with Maruja

602
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:44,872
it's because he feels dominated
by all of us.

603
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:47,024
But he isn't dominated.

604
00:34:47,193 --> 00:34:49,707
You still let him smoke
and read the newspaper.

605
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:52,624
Yes, but he thinks he is,

606
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:56,588
and that's why he wants
to take off that girl's blouse.

607
00:34:57,153 --> 00:34:58,506
You have to get angry

608
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:00,550
and sort this out.

609
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:03,667
You can't let that go on
in your own home

610
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,789
or forgive your husband
just like that.

611
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:10,313
A woman who isn't able to forgive

612
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:12,071
isn't a real woman,

613
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:15,191
and I'm not the one who has
to get angry, she is.

614
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:17,913
And I've taken steps
to make sure that Maruja

615
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:19,745
gets really angry.

616
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:21,471
What steps are those?

617
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,751
When she spies on me,
which is almost always,

618
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:28,622
I kiss and cuddle my husband.
Then she gets furious.

619
00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:31,148
And when a Spanish woman
gets furious,

620
00:35:31,313 --> 00:35:33,463
I'm told no one can
put up with her.

621
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,589
And Andres won't put up with her.

622
00:35:35,753 --> 00:35:37,948
And if your system doesn't work?

623
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,429
<i>Bon,</i>

624
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:42,149
there's no divorce here.

625
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:45,551
That's why men cheat
on their wives.

626
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:48,264
Men like to complicate their lives

627
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:50,993
so as well as having
their wives pester them

628
00:35:51,153 --> 00:35:54,748
they look for other different women
to pester them too.

629
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,471
Masochism, you know?

630
00:35:59,513 --> 00:36:01,424
Where did you learn that?

631
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,992
Reading,

632
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:04,472
observing

633
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:07,593
and listening to people
in the Galeries Lafayette.

634
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,828
Well...

635
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,393
Look, life goes past in a flash.

636
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,022
You blink...

637
00:36:17,193 --> 00:36:19,263
and you're my age, forty.

638
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:22,707
And at forty,
you're in the reserves,

639
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:26,071
especially if you take away 15,
like I do.

640
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:28,622
You have to make the most of time.

641
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:32,547
If it were me,

642
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:36,113
I'd kill both of them
with a shotgun.

643
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,671
Good night, Ninette.

644
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,151
<i>Bonne nuit, maman.</i>

645
00:36:43,513 --> 00:36:44,866
One last hand?

646
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:48,423
No, that's enough.
Look at the mess you've made!

647
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:50,671
Next time, put out a bit of ham.

648
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,303
A bit of ham! You should have
played a bit better.

649
00:36:56,993 --> 00:36:57,982
Listen, next time,

650
00:36:58,153 --> 00:37:00,986
don't wear so much cologne.
This place stinks.

651
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:02,506
One likes to be clean.

652
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:04,550
Everything annoys him.

653
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:07,466
When is Ninette opening the store?

654
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:10,029
We don't know yet.
We'll see.

655
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:13,629
Tell her from me
that I'll be her first customer.

656
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:15,704
-Sure.
-And give her a kiss.

657
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:18,467
-My regards to Ninette.
-I'll tell her.

658
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:20,271
And learn to play.

659
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:42,983
Hello.

660
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:45,912
<i>Hello, mon amour</i>

661
00:37:46,553 --> 00:37:47,588
Port...

662
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,544
<i>Porte-jarretelles.</i>

663
00:37:52,993 --> 00:37:54,108
Give me a kiss.

664
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,228
Why?

665
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:56,746
Because I need it.

666
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:58,904
Weren't you angry with me?

667
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:00,062
No.

668
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:02,147
Well, yes.

669
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,703
The other day I was in a bad mood.
But it would be unfair.

670
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:08,626
-I'm sure she's sorry.
-Who?

671
00:38:08,793 --> 00:38:09,703
Maruja.

672
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,023
Maru, as you call her.

673
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:15,587
She's a nice girl
and very hard working.

674
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:17,823
You have to keep her forever.

675
00:38:17,993 --> 00:38:19,745
What? I'm going to fire her.

676
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:21,426
You can't.

677
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,590
The labor laws don't allow it.

678
00:38:23,753 --> 00:38:25,550
To hell with the labor laws!

679
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:27,590
Who bothers about them here?

680
00:38:27,753 --> 00:38:30,950
Andres, it's best if she doesn't go.

681
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,071
You may be on your own soon

682
00:38:33,753 --> 00:38:36,108
and you'll need company.

683
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:38,948
Why do you say that?

684
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:41,702
Because my parents are moving

685
00:38:41,873 --> 00:38:44,228
to an apartment near the store.

686
00:38:44,393 --> 00:38:46,065
No, they needn't move out.

687
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:48,110
And I'll be out all day.

688
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,903
Maruja can't possibly leave.

689
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:56,706
Don't you realize that
It could be dangerous?

690
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:58,702
Why?

691
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,671
Just suppose,
and it's only supposing,

692
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,551
that that girl

693
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:06,066
fell in love with me.

694
00:39:07,873 --> 00:39:09,989
I wouldn't be surprised.

695
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:12,223
You're a very attractive man.

696
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,863
<i>Tres sympathique.
And you've got a wonderful smile.</i>

697
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:19,184
It wouldn't matter.

698
00:39:19,353 --> 00:39:21,787
What's your idea of morality?

699
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:23,909
Do you think Murcia is Babylon

700
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:26,268
and everyone here
can do as they wish?

701
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,344
<i>But I'm not jealous, mon amour.</i>

702
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:30,310
Well, you should be.

703
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:33,711
You're right,

704
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:36,550
but you're mistaken.

705
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:50,544
-I can't hear anything.
-Maybe it's broken.

706
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:52,467
By the way,

707
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,828
when will you give me
one of those birds?

708
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,746
I told you, they're not mine,
they're my son-in-law's.

709
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:00,950
You give me one and if he misses it
tell him it flew away.

710
00:40:01,113 --> 00:40:02,466
He won't believe it.

711
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,749
You want the bird inside its cage.

712
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:08,223
Of course. Do you expect me
To carry it on my finger?

713
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:12,428
Anyway, what I like most
about birds is the cage.

714
00:40:15,753 --> 00:40:17,152
We have to go
and play at the club.

715
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:18,143
No.

716
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:19,109
Why not?

717
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:20,183
Because.

718
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:22,821
I don't want to be seen so much
In public with you.

719
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:25,063
It harms me.
And we went

720
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:26,746
To the soccer game last week.

721
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:28,141
What about me?

722
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:32,029
Doesn't this relationship harm me?
People are evil minded.

723
00:40:33,713 --> 00:40:36,181
And priests are getting
a bad reputation these days.

724
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:37,945
Since we started wearing civvies,

725
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:39,592
you wouldn't believe what they say.

726
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:41,106
I know what they say.

727
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,342
Among other things,

728
00:40:42,513 --> 00:40:45,710
that one day
you'll be able to get married.

729
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:47,864
By the Church, of course.

730
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,111
Indissoluble matrimony.

731
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,662
God prevent such a misfortune!

732
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,463
<i>Bonsoir!</i>

733
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:16,306
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

734
00:41:17,193 --> 00:41:18,308
Maruja,

735
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,903
I've never seen anyone

736
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:23,109
who suits a uniform as much as you.

737
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:37,392
<i>Oh, la la!</i>

738
00:41:37,793 --> 00:41:39,704
<i>-Bonsoir, Ninette.
-Bonsoir, papa.</i>

739
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,784
-Ninette.
-Don Roque.

740
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:43,386
<i>Bonsoir a tout le monde.</i>

741
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:46,021
-Mme. Bernarda.
-How are you?

742
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:49,622
Bernarda,

743
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:52,310
what's happened to you?

744
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:54,023
Nothing.

745
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:58,188
This model came from Paris,
I liked it and I put it on.

746
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:01,302
<i>Isn't it tres jolie, mon pere?</i>

747
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:03,910
"Trays jolly".

748
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:14,148
These are the bags.
Like them?

749
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:17,950
"Ninette. Fashions from Paris."
Very nice.

750
00:42:25,353 --> 00:42:27,230
Are you the Spaniard?

751
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:32,822
Yes, Andres Martinez.

752
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:35,342
Ninette.

753
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,269
<i>I am sure, mademoiselle,</i>

754
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,344
that you'd like to kiss me.

755
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:56,152
Why is the door closed?

756
00:42:56,313 --> 00:42:58,463
We're balancing the books.

757
00:43:00,633 --> 00:43:03,431
What did you want?
Why the urgent call?

758
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:06,306
Are you happy?

759
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:07,428
Happy?

760
00:43:07,593 --> 00:43:09,345
Yes, really happy.

761
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:12,182
Well,

762
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:13,668
no.

763
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:15,262
Sit down.

764
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,952
Look, Armando,

765
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,107
there are women who like glamour,
indirect lighting.

766
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,833
They're usually mysterious,
a little unstable

767
00:43:30,993 --> 00:43:33,461
and spend a fortune
on perfume and clothes.

768
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:36,352
Then there are others,
docile, simple, home-lovers,

769
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,344
who adore waxing the floors,

770
00:43:38,513 --> 00:43:41,107
who move their lips a little
when they read

771
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:44,390
and who, when they kiss you, are
wondering if the tap is turned off.

772
00:43:44,553 --> 00:43:46,623
Those women are a drag,
but they're there.

773
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,590
They have their good side.

774
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,142
Maruja...

775
00:43:54,193 --> 00:43:56,946
She is both those kinds
of women together.

776
00:43:57,393 --> 00:43:58,746
You follow me?

777
00:43:59,793 --> 00:44:01,988
Frenzy and slippers.

778
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:03,427
What you have to do

779
00:44:03,593 --> 00:44:06,107
is marry her right away
before someone else gets her.

780
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:09,390
There are lots of men after her
because she's a real looker too.

781
00:44:10,153 --> 00:44:12,508
Get married and take her to Paris.

782
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:15,786
Armando, love is like fruit salts.

783
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,308
If you miss out
on the first effervescence,

784
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:19,588
it tastes like hell.

785
00:44:19,753 --> 00:44:21,823
She said that last night.

786
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,221
About fruit salts?

787
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:26,271
No, about getting married
and going to Paris.

788
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:28,469
I took her out for dinner
last night

789
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,783
and then for a walk
on the outskirts.

790
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:31,863
Well,

791
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:34,388
it's the third time we've been out.

792
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:37,388
And it's true, she's a looker.

793
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:40,504
And her kisses, Andres.

794
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:41,987
They're

795
00:44:42,153 --> 00:44:43,586
never-ending.

796
00:44:44,553 --> 00:44:47,511
You never said anything
about those little outings.

797
00:44:47,673 --> 00:44:49,152
She doesn't want anyone to know.

798
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:51,065
You know what they're like here.

799
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:54,225
She says she's crazy about me
and that this is terrible...

800
00:44:54,393 --> 00:44:56,349
...and what's to become of us.

801
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:11,501
Did you see
how she's dressed today?

802
00:45:11,673 --> 00:45:13,026
That's for you!

803
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,148
Today,

804
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,226
today, Nanking.

805
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,544
Nanking blue.

806
00:45:19,873 --> 00:45:22,671
Go on.
Cold, dominating...

807
00:45:23,193 --> 00:45:24,308
Watch this.

808
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:17,510
What are you doing?

809
00:46:18,113 --> 00:46:20,069
Packing for the trip.

810
00:46:20,593 --> 00:46:22,823
What trip?
That's my case.

811
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:25,905
Of course.
You're coming too.

812
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:27,951
Me? Where?

813
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:29,987
To Paris.

814
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:32,184
We've got lots of thing to buy.

815
00:46:32,353 --> 00:46:33,468
You for your store

816
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:35,066
and I for mine.

817
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:36,143
What store?

818
00:46:38,073 --> 00:46:39,301
Look, Andre,

819
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:43,261
"La Fuensanta" is very
old-fashioned, like the house.

820
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,912
No one comes in.

821
00:46:45,073 --> 00:46:48,429
Dad's been offered
the Citroen dealership for Murcia

822
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,870
and this place

823
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:53,547
could be the car showroom.

824
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:56,307
Dad will run the technical side

825
00:46:56,473 --> 00:46:59,670
and you, the commercial
and administrative side.

826
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,063
Dad doesn't want
to go back to Paris

827
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:03,905
because he loves Murcia,

828
00:47:04,073 --> 00:47:06,428
so we'll look after everything.

829
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:09,585
-But...
-We'll buy things for the boutique,

830
00:47:09,753 --> 00:47:12,187
clothes and disc brakes,

831
00:47:12,713 --> 00:47:14,271
all those things.

832
00:47:16,193 --> 00:47:18,548
And it'll be our honeymoon.

833
00:47:24,673 --> 00:47:28,348
We'll walk along the Champs Elysees,
the Bois de Boulogne...

834
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,549
<i>We'll have dinner
on the bateau-mouche.</i>

835
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:33,591
<i>Et on dinera
sur le bateau-mouche...</i>

836
00:47:34,073 --> 00:47:35,870
<i>ou dans le Quartier Latin.</i>

837
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:37,148
<i>Bien sur.</i>

838
00:48:04,073 --> 00:48:05,392
Since it opened,

839
00:48:05,553 --> 00:48:08,545
all the best hotels
have tried to imitate it.

840
00:48:16,553 --> 00:48:18,987
Kings, princes
and other celebrities,

841
00:48:19,153 --> 00:48:21,986
musicians, painters,
have stayed here.

842
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:24,065
That's a Tintoretto.

843
00:48:47,753 --> 00:48:49,789
-Oh, no!
-What did he say?

844
00:48:49,953 --> 00:48:52,513
Coco Chanel lived in our room.

845
00:49:30,153 --> 00:49:32,030
Every room has got a fireplace

846
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:35,708
and pink lampshades
to enhance the ladies' complexions.

847
00:49:37,913 --> 00:49:39,983
-Do you like it?
-Yes, tell him it's fine.

848
00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:43,941
Everything is at hand,
the floor, the walls, the telephone...

849
00:50:14,993 --> 00:50:15,948
<i>It's her!</i>

850
00:50:17,193 --> 00:50:19,832
<i>Yes, it's her.</i>

851
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:37,113
Ninette, I can see the Eiffel Tower,

852
00:50:37,713 --> 00:50:39,112
and the Seine,

853
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:41,066
and the boats.

854
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,389
That must be Montmartre...

855
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,864
Ninette, please,
don't do this to me.

856
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,147
<i>Mon amour, it's spring,</i>

857
00:50:56,313 --> 00:50:58,383
the best time in Paris.

858
00:50:58,553 --> 00:50:59,986
The heat is beginning.

859
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:03,111
The breeze is gentle,
from the north west.

860
00:51:03,713 --> 00:51:05,271
And everything is as good

861
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:08,345
as when we used to sit
on the stairs at night.

862
00:51:09,113 --> 00:51:10,387
Remember?

863
00:51:10,553 --> 00:51:11,702
Of course.

864
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:15,709
And Aries is entering
the moon's house today.

865
00:51:18,353 --> 00:51:20,071
<i>C’est le moment.</i>

866
