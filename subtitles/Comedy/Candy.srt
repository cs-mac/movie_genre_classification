1
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
<i> When I first met Candy...</ i></i>

2
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
<i> Those were like the
days of juice...</ i>.</i>

3
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
<i> Everything was bountiful... </ i></i>

4
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
<i> Birds filled the sky ...</ i></i>

5
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
<i> a great kindness float
through us... </ i></i>

6
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Heaven

7
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Here it is.

8
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm gonna try it your way this time.

9
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
This is just as good this way.
Honestly.

10
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Then why don't you do it?

11
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Schumann,
Why don't I do it?

12
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,100
Dan is a follower, Candy.
Not a leader.

13
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
We stick to snorting, keep it simple.

14
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,200
You know...
Dare to be different!

15
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Well I think I'd like to try it in the bath.

16
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
well that's different.

17
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Candy?

18
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Candy!

19
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Schumann, fucking help me!

20
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,200
<i> What?? </ i></i>

21
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,000
Come here!

22
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Come here!
Babe?

23
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Oh, Christ!

24
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,500
Shit, I think that she took too much.

25
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
Babe!

26
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Fucking saline solution or something?
I need saline solution!

27
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
<i> What? </ i></i>

28
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Fuck it!
Go and get a glass of water...

29
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,700
Put salt in it!
Hurry up!

30
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Come on!
Babe!

31
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,300
Candy! Look at me!

32
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,599
<i>How much salt? </ i></i>

33
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,300
I don't know! HEAPS!

34
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:11,300
Just fucking stir it!
Make sure it's dissolved!

35
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Come here!
Oh baby!??
Fuck!!

36
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't think this works man!
What the fuck's salt gonna do?

37
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,500
Shut up!

38
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,200
Fuck!
Hold her arm!

39
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,700
Hold her fucking arm, man!

40
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Harder!

41
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
This will not be.

42
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Here we go ...

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, it's not gonna fucking work!
It's bullshit!!

44
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,900
Shut up!

45
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Call an ambulance.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Here we go.

47
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Candy, look at me.

48
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Candy! Candy!

49
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Candy, Look at me!

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Babe ...

51
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Bring her back.

52
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
...back.

53
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Enough with the fucking salt.

54
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
It was beautiful.

55
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Intense.

56
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
<i>The future or the thing that  gleamed. </ i></i>

57
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
<i> The present was so very, very good. </ i></i>

58
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
<i>I wasn't trying to 
wreck Candy's life </ i>.</i>

59
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
<i> I was trying to make mine better. </ i></i>

60
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
<i> We wanted to share absolutely everything </ i>.</i>

61
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
<i>Especially 
the best bits </ i>.</i>

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I want to stay with you
forever.

63
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,700
<i> ...and who would'nt! </ i></i>

64
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
It's us!

65
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
It's called "The afternoon of
extravagant delight. "

66
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,900
By Candy Wyatt.

67
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
It's beautiful.

68
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
I love it!

69
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Casper.

70
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,000
Casper, It's Dan.

71
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,100
Daniel, hang on!, I'm coming in on a win and a prayer!

72
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,600
What?

73
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm trying to land
a Jumbo in Dubai.

74
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
What?

75
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
<i>Casper was like 
the dad you always wanted. </ i></i>

76
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The one that lets you have lollies and fizzy drinks

77
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
<i> he lets you stay up late, </ i></i>

78
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,000
<i> and watch movies
late at night. </ i></i>

79
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Daniel, how are you?

80
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
<i> Casper and I went way back. </ i></i>

81
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,200
I love you

82
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
<i> Is that right? </ i></i>

83
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,400
Yes!

84
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
This is George.

85
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
A very limited English,
but a very large penis.

86
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,900
Isn't that right, George?

87
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Ok.

88
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Our entire conversation is based on the 1995 "Lonely Planet" guide to Havana

89
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sit down.

90
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Just good friends.

91
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
So, what's on the agenda today?

92
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
<i> Not much, we're just wandering around. </ i></i>

93
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Um, Could you spare us $50?

94
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,800
Does is ever embarrassed you, Candy?
...His naked desperation!

95
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,400
Nakedness, I can deal with!

96
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Or give us some ecstasy
we can sell for it?

97
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm afraid that my days
as a manufacturer of ...

98
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,900
recreational farmaceuticals
has come to an end.

99
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,900
Why's that?

100
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,800
I've been made Associate Professor of
Organic Chemistry.

101
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
-Wow! Congratulations.
-Great.

102
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
So, suddenly I have a
reputation to uphold.

103
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
Well in that case, could we make it a hundred?

104
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
We'll pay it back!

105
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,300
Thanks, Cas.

106
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
Everything's alright, isn't it?

107
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,400
It's just a cash flow problem.
Only 7 days.

108
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
And you, Candy?

109
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,900
Being one that's so new to the path
of the dead!

110
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
She is fine.

111
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,600
When you can stop,
people don't want to...

112
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
... and when you want to stop,
You can't!

113
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,500
One of life's little riddles!

114
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
What Grandma?

115
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,500
Off you go!

116
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Thank you, Casper.

117
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, are you ready?

118
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
One, two, three ...

119
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,400
I feel like some confused
Sesame Street character!

120
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Start the car.

121
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,700
My own parents had long since
cut me adrift

122
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,100
<i> The Wyatts, on the other hand,
kept their firm hold on the ropes. </ i></i>

123
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Do you want more potatoes?

124
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,900
-It was nice to visit places
where the fridge was always full.

125
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,900
I shall have to bring my plate round
when I come here!

126
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,800
I think you'll find that's part of the carbohydrate.

127
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
What do you think?

128
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,400
I don't know.
I don't know.

129
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,900
See how you go.

130
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
Stretchers?

131
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
They're like wooden frames you
stretch the canvass on.

132
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
and anyway, I feel really stupid ...

133
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,600
... I did about a month ago,
and as of tomorrow I'm gonna lose
our deposit on the stretchers.

134
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
It is really rude to ask ...

135
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
... but at least I won't surprise her!

136
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,800
I can give you the money back
the next time I see you again.

137
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,900
Can you ring him, and tell him to
wait for a week?

138
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
I already tried that pretty much
last week.

139
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
What if I rang him for you?

140
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I haven't got the card with me.

141
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
How much is it?

142
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,900
150.

143
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
Mate, the question is not the money.

144
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
I really appreciate it.

145
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,900
The question...
is the future of my daughter.

146
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Mate, she's fantastic!

147
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Should see her paintings!

148
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,100
The question is you.

149
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
When are you gonna do something?

150
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
I've got some ideas.

151
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,300
I've sent some of my poems into
Heat magazine.

152
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Here we are! -Milk...
and sugar, There!

153
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
-Thanks babe!
-Thanks, Elaine.

154
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
You're not a teenager anymore.

155
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
You know that, don't you?

156
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Yes, I know that, Jim.

157
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
that is why I did'nt want
you to do it!

158
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,300
No, it's alright! It's fine!

159
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,600
Look at it!
You've turned it into butter!

160
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,700
I told you to keep it on blend!

161
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
I put it on "Whip", because
I'm whipping cream!

162
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Yes, but you don't know how to use it.

163
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Right... You do it!!

164
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
-Uhh!! Well it's too late now!!
-Ah well!! Excuse me!!

165
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,100
Well all these settings are relatve, and if you're not familiar with the workings of the machine ...

166
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Then why the fuck does it say "Whip"?

167
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
I'll give them ice cream.

168
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
And please don't swear.

169
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,000
<i>Right! Well, I was going to give you cream, but I'm going to have to give you Ice Cream. </ i></i>

170
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,000
<i> - Everything okay in there?
-Well, we live in hope! </ i>.</i>

171
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
<i> A good place to live. </ i></i>

172
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Go!!

173
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
I wonder if that was it?

174
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
If that was what?

175
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
The last shot.

176
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
I wouldn't care.

177
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
It was my Nana's.

178
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,000
We're going to sell anything
We're only hocking it!

179
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
We'll get it back!

180
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
$25.

181
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
...and He doesn't want the paints.

182
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I'll be back!

183
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,400
He said maybe we could work
something out!.

184
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Let's go!

185
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Yes, I fucked him!

186
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
For $50.

187
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
I stink!

188
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You okay?

189
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm Sorry.

190
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Don't be!

191
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,300
<i> Here is the deepest secret,
that nobody knows </ i>.</i>

192
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
<i> Here is the root of the root,
and the bud of the bud...</ i></i>

193
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,800
<i> ...and the sky of the sky,
in the tree called life </ i>.</i>

194
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,900
<i> which grows higher than soul
can hope, or mind can hide </ i>.</i>

195
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,600
<i> ..and this is the one that is
keeping the stars apart. </ i></i>

196
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I carry your heart.

197
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,500
I carry it in my heart.

198
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Will you marry me?

199
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
We will be man and wife.

200
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
One flesh.

201
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,800
I will ask them if they freely undertake the obligations of marriage ...

202
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
... and to state that there is no
legal impediment to the marriage.

203
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Are you ready,
freely and without reservation ...

204
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,400
<i> to give yourself to eachother...
in marriage?</ i></i>

205
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
<i>We are!</ i></i>

206
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,300
<i> Are you ready for love
and honor each other ...</ i></i>

207
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
<i> ... as husband and wife,
for the rest of your life? </ i></i>

208
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
-We are!
-We are!

209
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Candice and Dan ...

210
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Come back, love.

211
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Ah, okay.

212
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,400
Alright everyone, Close together!
Balloons down, Jenny.

213
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Big smiles, everyone!
Happy Day!

214
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,800
One, two... Oh, Shit!

215
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,900
Schumann!

216
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,000
-One, two... Three!
-Right...

217
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
Alright everyone!
Back to our place for a few drinks,
and a bite to eat?

218
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,600
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go,
I've got an appointment!

219
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,100
Oh! Well, I hope that nobody else
has got an appointment!

220
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm in for the long hall, Mrs. Wyatt.

221
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Good.

222
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,900
No, I hate spelling!

223
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,700
Yeah, me too! Spelling and maths!

224
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,900
I was always hopeless at
spelling and maths.

225
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
-I like English.
-English?

226
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like stories and stuff?

227
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Yeah!

228
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,700
English and Sport!

229
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,500
Well you can't go wrong there.

230
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,100
You can be a Sports journalist.

231
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,800
Really?

232
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I could see you as a
sports journalist.

233
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Well, Dan, you're laughing mate!

234
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Financing this love
as a married couple.

235
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,200
You get the first one under your belt,
you pour everything into it.

236
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
After that, the minimum equity is
what you're after.

237
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,600
You get into as much debt
as possible.

238
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
It gives you some focus.

239
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm not just talking about
real estate.

240
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,900
I'm talking about a philosophy.

241
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,100
Would you mind...
if you excuse me for a minute?

242
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
No! Sure!!

243
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,800
Where are you and Dan going
for the honeymoon?

244
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
- More lemonade?
Yeah, thanks!

245
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
You're so tight!
You're selling next year?

246
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,100
Abbots Road! It's just round
the corner from us!

247
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,300
Geez, that'll be a change, eh?

248
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,600
Yeah, I'd rather go to a state school,
but, it's mom and dad...

249
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,700
<i> Jenny, could you come and help
with sanwiches </ i></i>

250
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,300
I'll give you a hand too,
Auntie Cap!

251
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,400
- What?
- What are you doing in there?

252
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Doing a shit.

253
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
No you're not!

254
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,500
Open the door.

255
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,400
I can't!

256
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,800
<i> You greedy fuckup!!</ i></i>

257
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Rather a selfish
way to begin a marriage!

258
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Really! All done!

259
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Dick!

260
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,900
<i> Obviously, it was a
big dope weekend! </ i></i>

261
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
You wanna be relaxed at
your own wedding. </ i>

262
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
-Sorry about that.
-That's fine!

263
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,100
So where were we?

264
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,900
I was saying, you need to get your t...

265
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
-Do you need a seat?
Yeah, sure! Have a seat!

266
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You need to get your toe in the
the market, Jim!

267
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
You know what I'mn saying?
Out of suburbs, fine!

268
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Two bedroom...

269
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
...You don't need a garden
courtyard, do you?

270
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
You want the worst house,
in the best street!

271
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,700
You don't need a kitchen or bathroom...

272
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,200
...Put it in later!

273
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,300
Say for example,
you want to borrow ...

274
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,700
...400.

275
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Or 300...

276
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:23,200
You do it...
You Struggle...

277
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Understand?

278
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Dan?

279
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Dan?

280
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Dan!

281
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Dan...

282
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Wake up.

283
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Dan, Dan, wake up.

284
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
I'm fucked.

285
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Too much champagne.

286
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah I'm...
I'm sure it's that...

287
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,100
Well, it is the big day!

288
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
<i> I'll make some coffee. </ i></i>

289
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
<i> He's drunk! </ i></i>

290
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,800
<i> Is there anything you
want to talk to me about?</ i></i>

291
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
<i> What? </ i></i>

292
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,400
What's going on?

293
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
Mum, you know what's going on!

294
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,100
We are having a lovely time!

295
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
That's not what I meant.

296
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Well then, I don't know what you mean!

297
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,300
What's wrong with Dan?

298
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,000
He's just pissed, Mum!
He's hopeless!!

299
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Sorry.

300
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Thanks for the beautiful reception.

301
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It'd kill your father, you know.

302
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Think we should stop?

303
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,900
-What? Now that we're respectable?
-Yeah, I know!

304
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
You know what I mean.

305
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Whenever you say the word.

306
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,800
We are the coolest people
in McDonalds!

307
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
<i> We had a lot going for us. </ i></i>

308
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,200
<i>We'd found the secret glue 
that held all things together </ i></i>

309
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
<i> in a perfect place...</ i></i>

310
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
<i> ...where the noise
did not intrude</ i>.</i>

311
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,900
<i> Our world was...
so very complete. </ i></i>

312
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Earth

313
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
-Hey baby!
-Hi!

314
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
How was it?

315
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,900
About the same.

316
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,700
Here's $200.

317
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,300
I'm gonna give it half an hour
and then I'll split!

318
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,200
Yeah. I won't be long.
I'll meet you at home.

319
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Ok, I see you there.

320
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
OK.

321
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,900
<i> They say that for every 10 years
you've been a junkie ...</ i></i>

322
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,100
<i>  You will have spent 7 of them
...waiting. </ i></i>

323
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,400
<i> One way is not bad
have as much time to think </ i>.</i>

324
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,500
<i> on the other, the anxiety
was a full time job!</ i></i>

325
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
- Hey?
- You slimey cunt!

326
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,300
- What?
- What do you fucking reckon?

327
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
I just had a quick little bit!
It was nothing!

328
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,100
Where?

329
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,600
Um, In the park.
When I met Ange.

330
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,100
Did Angela do it with you?

331
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
No, of course not!
We left as soon as we did the deal!

332
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,400
Only because he's decent enough
to go home to his girlfriend.
Like you should be!

333
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,900
Oh candy! He sold me the dope!
Why would he want to have a hit
in the public toilet?

334
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Well why the fuck would you?

335
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,400
Oww!
Look, I admit it was dumb!

336
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Okay?

337
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I'm Sorry!

338
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Will you let me make you a nice taste!

339
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm getting sick of this, dickhead!

340
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
What is your problem?

341
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,800
You are my problem!

342
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,400
You are a waste of space.

343
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,100
Are you getting your period
or something?

344
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
No, Dan.

345
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,900
I hardly have my period anymore!

346
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,500
...because my body's
all fucked up!

347
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,900
It's this fucking nightmare
you've led me into!

348
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Oh right! Like I held a
gun to your head! Did I? Eh??

349
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Held you down, hit you up, did I?

350
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Fuck You!

351
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
Fuck you too, Candy!

352
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
Well, Fuck you double then!

353
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,000
Dan, have you noticed, the more
I work, the less I paint?

354
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,200
Candy, I don't want a fight! OK?

355
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,200
I just don't see what your problem is tonight! I mean...

356
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We've got a life!

357
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,900
It's neither good nor bad! OK?

358
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,600
Do you know... Do you know what I do?

359
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,800
Listen to this, dick fuck!

360
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,700
What do I do all day?

361
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,400
I fuck men I hate!

362
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,700
-Don't do this.
-What are going to do about it?

363
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,400
Look, Okay, that's it! Alright?

364
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
No more brothels, No more escorts!

365
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
-We're gonna take the time to
start a new life!
-You don't understand do you?

366
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
That's really it this time.
That's going away!

367
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,400
Maybe I want to keep using!

368
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
You know, I'm sick of working, yes,
but...

369
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
...What if I want to keep using?
What are you gonna do about it?

370
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Candy!

371
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,600
Why don't you ring gay blokes?

372
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,300
You start working!
You hock your ass!

373
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Hey, you know you can not do that!

374
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
You know, I'll get...
I'll get AIDS!

375
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,200
No you won't, you moron!

376
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,400
You'll make them use condoms,
like everybody else!

377
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,500
I wouldn't know what to do.

378
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,800
You're heterosexual, right? So you're
just doing what you're good at anyway.

379
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,000
Did you even hear what you're saying?

380
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,000
Let me fuck women, no problems!

381
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,400
If I can do it with women, I'd make us all the money! You'd never have to work, I swear!

382
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
But... These women, they want
muscle types, don't they?

383
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,100
If there was a market out there, I'd
do it, but I don't think there is!

384
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,500
And I'd be hopeless with the gay stuff!
You know that!

385
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,400
You're fucking unbeleivable!

386
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
I can't get to sleep with that on.

387
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Can you turn it off?

388
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Candy, it's a really good movie!

389
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
I'll turn it down, okay?

390
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Anyway, it finishes in half an hour.

391
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Fuck you!

392
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Go to bed.

393
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
How can you even hear that?

394
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
The light's bugging me!

395
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
<i> I can't believe it. </ i></i>

396
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,800
<i> I can't fucking believe it. </ i></i>

397
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
What? I'm not making any noise.

398
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
The light!

399
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
The Light's keeping me awake.

400
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
OK, look! I'll cover the light!
Hmm??

401
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,800
There's more light coming from the
workshop than that!

402
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,900
<i> Asshole! </ i></i>

403
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,200
<i>The pen!! I can hear the pen
scratching on the paper! </ i>.</i>

404
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
How? This is ridiculous, Candy.

405
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,100
You're just looking for an excuse!

406
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,500
Turn off the light and come to bed.

407
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,300
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore!

408
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,500
Turn the light off!

409
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,000
Nope! I'm not even talking to you!

410
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
-TURN THE FUCKING LIGHT OFF!!
-...Aghhh!

411
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
FUCK!!

412
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh my God! Oh my God!

413
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,100
-Shit.
-I'm so sorry, Danny!

414
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,900
-What the fuck was that?
-Oh my God! Oh baby! Oh shit!

415
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Jesus! It's fuckin' blood!

416
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
I didn't mean to hurt you...

417
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Jesus fuckin' shit, alright!.
Fuck!

418
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,400
Is there any chance for some morphine?

419
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
I'm in a fair bit of pain.

420
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,400
I don't think you need any morphine.

421
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,300
I don't think you're in
much pain at all!

422
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Oh well, it was worth a try!

423
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,300
Excuse me, would you mind if we um,
bought a couple of flavoured milks off you?

424
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
-Just take a couple.
-You sure?

425
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,100
No worries!

426
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,200
-Want some of this?
-Yeah!

427
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,800
-Have a good night!
-Thanks.
-Thankyou!

428
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
D'you want anymore?

429
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
It's been a while.

430
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Yeah! It's been a while.

431
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm sorry I hurt your head.

432
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
I'll get you back!

433
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Hello....
Anybody home?

434
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Who the fuck are you?

435
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, it's me!
Phil.

436
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Phillip Dudley,
from Commercial Realty.

437
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
I've written to you lately.

438
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,500
-What's the problem?
-Well...

439
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,600
We've been writing to you about...
Um...

440
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,300
I've got these...
er... hang on...
Er, here they are!

441
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,800
Copies of the three letters
we've sent you recently...

442
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,700
Relating to the matter of your er,
rent in arrears.

443
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm here to confirm that the 3rd of
these letters is in actual fact a
notice to vacate.

444
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Effective 7 days hence.

445
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,500
Fuck!

446
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,800
Well of course it was...
28 days when you received the letter.

447
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,300
Now, what I'm actually here for today...

448
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,800
is to point out to you the
shortfall owing on the fault
of your bond.

449
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,000
Assuming... you've paid no more rent between now and next wednesday...

450
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,300
We've calculated that the shortfall
will be er... $1,125.

451
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,100
Listen, Phillip...

452
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,300
...we're junkies!

453
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
I am a hooker!

454
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
He's hopeless!

455
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,700
Right now, things are very complicated!
We haven't got any money.

456
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Right.

457
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,000
<i> But it was good...</ i></i>

458
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,300
<i> Right when times got tough...</ i></i>

459
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,900
<i>There was always Casper. </ i>.</i>

460
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,800
Ah, the young ones!

461
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Hi!

462
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
<i>Our... port in the storm! </ i>.</i>

463
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Don't get overexcited!

464
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
<i> ...our gingerbread house! </ i></i>

465
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,100
For once... Here I come...
Bearing Treats!

466
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
So is this it?

467
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,600
An honour student didn't show,
so I had an idle hour to fill.

468
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
You made that in an hour?

469
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,900
Well... Panadine to morphine,
in about an hour and 10!

470
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,000
If you get rid of the paracetamol...

471
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,100
...do a few things...

472
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,200
...and morphine to heroin in 15 minutes.

473
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,500
Thankyou, you guys!

474
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,300
Rearrange the atoms...

475
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
...take a bit off...

476
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,500
...put a bit on...

477
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
Liquid Diamorphine...

478
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,200
Commonly known as heroin,
pharmaceutical grade, pure.

479
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
I call it "My Yellow Jesus!"

480
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Papa bear.

481
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,000
Mama bear.

482
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Baby bear.

483
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,400
<i>It's just that... Candy says I
have to start pulling my weight! </ i></i>

484
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Yeah.

485
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,200
What do you know about gay escorts?

486
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Growth market.

487
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,500
Would you mind if asked you a few
technical questions?

488
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,300
There's nothing I'd rather
discuss with you!

489
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,400
What do they expect you to do?

490
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,900
Well there's a big down in the park!

491
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,300
Why don't you pop down
and do some research!

492
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,800
I mean...

493
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,200
If they pay you, would they
expect you to have a stiffie?

494
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
It Helps!

495
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,800
I don't think I could manage that.

496
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
I'm just washing my hands.

497
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Alright!

498
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,300
He'll cancel his cards.

499
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,900
Not if I get to him first.

500
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,400
M. Ro. Roger. Rog. Rogie baby!
Roger, Donald.

501
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
R.D. Here it is!

502
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,700
R.D. Moylan,
48 Charles Street, Petersham.

503
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
He'll trace the call.

504
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,100
That's why they invented
prepaid phones.

505
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Ah, Hi! Roger?

506
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Is that Roger Moylan?

507
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,400
Yeah, Look! Look, This is hard...

508
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,900
I'm the guy who stole your wallet.

509
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Yep! No, hold on! I'm sorry, okay?
That's why I'm calling! I'm really sorry!

510
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,200
I just... I was after some money,
I saw some cash... and you had none...

511
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,200
I want to give your wallet back!

512
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,600
No, I know! I feel so stupid!
It's just that I'm...

513
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,600
I'm so lonely right now...

514
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,100
I've got no money,
I've just come from Adelaide...

515
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,700
And I've got no friends...

516
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,900
You know, I saw the wallet on the seat, and I took it! I wasn't thinking!

517
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,800
And I'm not interested in your
credit cards.

518
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,500
I just want to do the right thing
and give it back to you.

519
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,000
Uhh...  Well, no! I mean now's not a good time, I...

520
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,600
I'm a little bit nervous about
this whole thing anyway!

521
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,300
Can we just...
Let's meet in the morning!

522
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,300
What...
What time do you go to work?

523
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,900
So you're in Petersham, right?

524
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,400
Umm... Isn't there a footie oval down
there or something?

525
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,700
How about we meet out in front of
the greyhound stand?

526
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,000
9:30? Is that good?

527
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,300
Well I'll be wearing a
blue baseball cap!

528
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,500
Look! look, Take my number!

529
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You got a pen?
Yep, Right...

530
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,300
- 0422 844 881
- [That's my Plumber's!]

531
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Yes, 881.

532
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,800
Well, have you got...
a mobile just in case there's a...

533
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,700
Yeah... Yeah!
Hey, Tell me one thing...

534
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,100
How did you manage to get such a
cute photo on your license?

535
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,400
I'm Sorry! Yeah, I'm sorry,
I go too far!

536
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Alright! 9:30 then!
I'll see you then!

537
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,600
Alright, Thanks Rog!
Okay, bye!

538
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,500
Imagine if you'd turned your powers
to the benefit of mankind... Dan!

539
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,300
Does this look like me?

540
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Not even remotely.

541
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I could use these!

542
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
And a bit of...

543
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
...How about now?

544
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Caucasian man with glasses.

545
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,500
Yes!

546
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,300
I felt like Tarzan,
at fuckin' last!

547
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,100
I had to hunt down some
food for Jane.

548
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,900
I knew it was in my power
to do something brave.

549
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,600
Yeah...

550
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Can we talk about this
when you get back to the office?

551
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,800
20 minutes... Okay, bye!

552
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,700
Sorry about that!

553
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,000
Good morning,
How are you?

554
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,600
Ah, good!
How are you?

555
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,200
Good.

556
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,700
I just uh, wanted to check my
current balance on this please!

557
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,300
Okay, I'll just need to get you to
enter in your PIN...

558
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,300
Oh God, I'm...
terrible with this!

559
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,200
God! Do you ever have trouble
remembering your PIN?

560
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,900
You'd be surprised at the number of
people who forget them.

561
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,400
Yeah I know!
That's why I came inside...

562
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,300
Because I couldn't remember it
out at the ATM, and I thought...

563
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,000
You know I could just er..
If I had ID?

564
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,900
No! I'm sorry, you need your PIN
number for all transactions. It's...

565
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,600
It's one of those security things!

566
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,700
No! Of course, of course!
I understand. Um...

567
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,900
So you can't just...

568
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,500
I really can't!

569
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,300
Hello?

570
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,300
-Mr. Moylan?
-Yes?

571
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
-Mr. Roger Moylan?
-Yes?

572
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,300
Roger Moylan, This is Ewan Douglas
from the Commonwealth Bank
Security division...

573
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,200
Yes? Is something the matter?

574
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,300
We've been tracking some unusual
activity on your credit card, in
the last 24 hours...

575
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,300
Oh no!

576
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,800
When was the last time
you used your Master Card?

577
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,000
Um, look! I think my wallet was
stolen last night...

578
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,600
Did you report it missing?

579
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
I was just calling now!

580
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,300
<i> But I called you. </ i></i>

581
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,000
Um, I mean I was about to call.

582
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,400
Sir, Mr. Moylan, I'm going to have to
verify your details for a security check.

583
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,500
Would you please tell me your
Date of Birth?

584
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,400
Um... 13th of March, 1977.

585
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
Mother's Maiden Name?

586
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,700
Er, Lynch.

587
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,200
Number of security?

588
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,200
Is that like your PIN number?

589
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,400
Well, it shouldn't be...
but you often find that it is!

590
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,000
Umm...
Try... 3279

591
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,300
It's just one of those days, you know... where everythings just gone!

592
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,500
It happens all the time!

593
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,500
Um, but listen... I've already got my daily limit out from the ATM outside...

594
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,500
...But I actually need more, because
I'm trying to buy this beautiful old Mercedes....

595
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,100
...you know, the cream ones,
you know, the TLS?

596
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,500
Anyway, the guy's willing to negotiate for cash...

597
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
...$2247.

598
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,800
God, we're going to be
in the poor house!

599
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
...and 50 cents.

600
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,800
Never get sentimental about a car!

601
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,600
I might just get you to check the
available credit on this card...

602
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I can get a cash advance, can't I?

603
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,900
Candy? Candy!

604
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
I did it! I did it!
I fucking did it, baby!

605
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,600
I fucking did it!

606
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,400
God, You... are going to fucking LOVE me for this...

607
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,200
7 Grand!!

608
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,500
Oh god! You should have seen it!
I was fucking great! It was like...

609
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It was like that movie
we saw with that...

610
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,700
God, what was his name,
that actor we like?

611
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,400
...and he gets all that money,
and he walks in and he's all coool,
and stuf like that...
-Danny!

612
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:37,400
I'm pregnant.

613
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
Shit.

614
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Candy.

615
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,100
Crap.

616
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,300
It couldn't be, uh...

617
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,900
No.

618
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
We never broke a condom.

619
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,300
I'd know.

620
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,900
It was the night
I broke your skull.

621
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,200
How fucking weird.

622
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
One night.

623
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,200
I can get an abortion.

624
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,000
No.

625
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
No, no way!

626
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,700
This is good.

627
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,200
It was meant to be.

628
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,900
This is what we need.

629
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
We've got to stop using.

630
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,600
Yeah.

631
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,200
Yeah, of course.

632
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,600
Sugar?

633
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,200
Two, please.

634
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,600
We've got some news everybody...

635
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,600
We're having a baby.

636
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:22,500
Ah, Darling!

637
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
Candice, Good God.

638
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,400
We just wanted you to know that
we've made some decisions. and uh...

639
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,100
We've been putting some money aside,
haven't we?

640
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,000
We're going to get out of that
whole warehouse environment.

641
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,100
...and live in a proper house.

642
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,300
Yeah! We really want to raise
our child in the....

643
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,500
...in a proper home.

644
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,400
Have you told your parents?

645
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,000
No.

646
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
Day 1

647
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,900
We knew what we had
to do.

648
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,100
It takes alot of planning to stop.

649
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,700
Lucky at last!
We can really do this, Candy.

650
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,300
It's going to be hard, but...

651
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
I'm sure it's like a bridge...

652
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,900
And once we cross it,
everything will be okay.

653
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,700
You can get back into your
painting again...

654
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,100
Maybe we'll move to the country...

655
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,300
Grow some veggies...

656
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,700
Feed the chickens...

657
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,100
We could go live in Thailand...

658
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,800
Thailand would be great,
if we didn't use.

659
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
Or the Himalayas.

660
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
We'll go canoeing...

661
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,600
A bit of white water rafting...

662
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,500
Get healthy, sleep well...

663
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,600
...not have drugs in our system.

664
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,400
How good would that be?

665
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
We really have to do this.

666
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
We have to do it this time.

667
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,300
Yeah, we will.

668
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,300
We are.

669
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,700
We're really fuckin' doing it!

670
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Day 2

671
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,900
Day 4

672
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,300
I can't do it.

673
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,900
I can't do it.

674
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,200
Hey!
Come back to bed.

675
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Alright? You'll catch a cold.

676
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Casper, It's Candy.

677
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,100
Ring me as soon as you get this.

678
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
We've tried your mobile.

679
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,100
I know we said to ignore us while
we did this, but...

680
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,600
3 days...

681
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,400
...we did pretty well, but
we're not feeling so great now.

682
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,800
We don't want you to ignore us now.

683
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Are you there?

684
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,100
Pick up if you're there.

685
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
Pick up!

686
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,900
Okay, you're not there.

687
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,500
Call us!!

688
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,700
Shit! Shit!

689
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,700
Shit! Shit! Shit!

690
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,500
Kojak? It's Candy!

691
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,400
Um... Shit, not so good.

692
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,500
I'm really sick. I mean...

693
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,600
We just need credit.

694
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,200
Uh... I can work a shift,
and then I can pay you back.

695
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,800
Yeah, well if I work a shift,
then I can pay that too.

696
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,800
I can't work when I'm this sick!

697
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Ok, bye.

698
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Fucking cunt!!

699
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,200
Candy.

700
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,600
-Candy.
-Oh God!

701
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,600
Answer!
Answer, please!

702
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,100
He was just about to answer!

703
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:51,300
-Give me the phone.
-I want the fucking phone!

704
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,300
Don't fucking take it away from me!
No! No!!

705
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:59,900
-We can do it.
-No! Get away!! Nooooo!!

706
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,900
Candy, you're bleeding.

707
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,600
Candy, you're bleeding.

708
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,700
Why are you bleeding?

709
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,600
The water has broken.
Her cervix has dilated.

710
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,100
This is what we didn't
want to happen.

711
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,200
We call this an
inevitable miscarriage.

712
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
There's no going back.

713
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,100
As I was explaining to Candy,
she's going to have to go through
a kind of... labour!

714
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,500
I don't know however long that takes, you need to know that at this state of
the pregnancy...

715
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,200
...the baby is not going to survive.

716
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,000
I'm Sorry.

717
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,200
Give me pethidine!

718
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,700
I want pethidine!

719
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,800
Will you give her the fucking
pethidine, or what?

720
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
She's fucking in pain,
can't you see this?

721
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,800
That's it! Candy, push!

722
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,200
Almost there!
Push!
That's it!!

723
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,500
Can I hold it?

724
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,500
Doctor, it's leg moved.

725
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:25,900
It's just a spasm.

726
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,700
It moved!

727
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,700
It's just a spasm.

728
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,800
Hell

729
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,900
-How much did you get?
-50.

730
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,800
That guy is still back there.

731
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,600
-Maybe you'll sell some. Yeah?
-Alright.

732
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,200
<i>Everything we ever did...</ i></i>

733
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,700
<i> we did with the best
of intentions... </ i></i>

734
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,300
<i> But.. events tumble!
and the years pile up.</ i></i>

735
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,700
<i> The world is very bewildering
to a junkie. </ i></i>

736
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,800
Yeah, we're all good!

737
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:03,100
-Well... Tastes bad.
-Fuck!

738
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,100
Here you go.

739
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,400
Do you feel anything?

740
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,600
No.

741
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,400
-Shit!
-Shit!

742
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,900
<i> and still... you cling to
the concept of change. </ i></i>

743
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,200
Hey, Schumann...

744
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,500
...we are thinking of moving
up the country for a while.

745
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,200
Give methadone a try.

746
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,600
What the fuck difference
would it make?

747
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,400
The air's cleaner, for one.

748
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,200
It's a kitchen.

749
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,100
It's a bit dark, isn't it?

750
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,100
Yeah.

751
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,100
Yeah, we Could um...

752
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:12,100
knock out a hole...
and put a skylight.

753
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,000
I love you.

754
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,100
Any frozen peas?

755
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,100
No.

756
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,000
I got one!
There he is!

757
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,700
It was all the way down
in the turbo frost.

758
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,900
I can not believe you didn't do
this, this morning.

759
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
What time are they coming?

760
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,900
Fuck!!

761
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,600
What's the date?

762
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,000
Oh no, this expired a month ago.

763
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,400
Look at that! It smells bad!

764
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,900
-That's got that kind of chicken smell!
-Yeah it does doesn't it!

765
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:01,900
Not to worry, we'll just
baste it in lots of stuff!
Like uh...

766
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,900
Basil, uh... honey?
Bayleaves or something?

767
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,300
What's in the cupboard?

768
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
What do you put on a roast?

769
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,800
How long did it take you to
get out here?

770
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,300
Oh, About an hour and 40 minutes?
Dear?

771
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,600
Yeah, about... 40? 45?

772
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,200
Much traffic?

773
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,300
No, pretty good run really.

774
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Can't complain.

775
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,300
It's so beautiful here,
the drive down was so beautiful.

776
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,500
Yeah, it's...
Countryside.

777
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,700
Had any news on the job front?

778
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,700
Um... Well it's pretty...
There's not much work around here.
We're getting by on the dole.

779
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,100
Well, apparently I might be able to
get some work hay bailing.

780
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,700
Hay bailing?

781
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,300
-Ooooh! Tough work, hay bailing!
-Yeah.

782
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,200
So! What can I do in the kitchen?

783
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,200
Nothing mum, really!
It's fine!

784
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,800
Nonsense, there must be something
I can do to help.

785
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,600
Everything's under control.

786
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,400
The oven's heating up.

787
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,900
We're running a bit behind.

788
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,500
<i> No worries, mate. </ i></i>

789
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:27,100
Oh This is unbelievable.
You go to all this trouble
to invite us up here...

790
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,400
...and you can't even manage the
simple decency of getting the meal
together on time!

791
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,000
Get off my case, mum!

792
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,300
Is not food that's even the issue here.

793
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,600
It's your attitude!

794
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,100
Okay, let's just calm down.
Lunch will be ready in less than an hour.

795
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,100
Who wants some wine?

796
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,600
That chicken is rock solid!

797
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,000
We're not going to be eating before
midnight.

798
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,300
And where are the vegetables?

799
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,300
Hey hey, Let's all calm down, honey.

800
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
What do you think is about?

801
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,500
Sunday Lunch.
It's a pretty simple thing.

802
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,300
But with you two, there's no
such thing as simple.

803
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,600
The drugs!

804
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,600
The drugs always come first.

805
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,600
Hey no, that is not true.

806
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,800
We're doing really well now.

807
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,500
Do you have any idea...

808
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,600
...what you have done to my family?

809
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,900
To me?

810
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,300
What happened to that beautiful girl?

811
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,800
What happened?

812
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
What happened?

813
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
Can't you see?

814
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,600
Don't you understand?

815
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:36,100
I have been clutching my fucking fists
since I was 6 years old.

816
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,100
Look at my fucking fists!
Look at them!

817
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,500
Look at them, you fucking bitch!

818
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,900
Don't you understand?

819
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,800
No! I gotta clench my hands!

820
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,400
I gotta clench my hands!
I can't relax.

821
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,700
Darling, darling! Look!
It's been a big move.

822
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,700
It's been a big year.

823
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,500
There's been lots of changes.

824
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,400
C'mon, you've lost a child.

825
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,300
But you ARE getting your lives together.
I can see that!

826
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,100
Just go.

827
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,300
Fuck off.

828
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,100
Forget lunch.

829
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,300
Can we?

830
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,800
Can we cancel the lunch?

831
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,500
Maybe we can just make
this another day.

832
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,600
Today is just a bad day.
I'm sorry.

833
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,900
I'm scared.

834
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
There's nothing to be scared of.

835
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
There's nothing to be scared of.

836
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,500
D'you think we're going to end?

837
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,100
-We'll never end.
-It'll end.

838
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
It's not gonna work.

839
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Is that the flu vaccine?

840
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,600
It's medicine.

841
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
It's leading us not into temptation.

842
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,800
Hey Candy, check out this.

843
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,700
Brickie's labourer.

844
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,100
-I'll give it a call, eh.
-Why don't you do that.

845
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,400
-Hi.
-Hey!

846
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,900
This is Paul.
He lives up the road.

847
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,900
Good day.

848
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,200
He's got some good home grow.

849
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,200
Great.
Can I get some more?

850
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,700
Um... There is none left.

851
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,400
Then I'll grab a beer.

852
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,000
There's none of that either.

853
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,500
I'm gonna go and get some more pot.

854
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,800
Uh.. We gonna grab some dinner,
or What?

855
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,500
No, you eat! I'll be fine.

856
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,100
You want some money?
I got paid.

857
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,800
-No.
-No, it's okay mate.

858
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,800
Where were you?

859
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,100
Don't you fuck this one with
your negative comments.

860
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,800
What are you doing?

861
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,600
Going back to my art.

862
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,700
Does not mean anything to you?

863
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Have you been fuckingt that guy?

864
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,500
You do not know what
you're talking about.

865
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,500
Where have you been all night?

866
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,300
Away from you.

867
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,200
You fucked him, didn't you?

868
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,700
Firstly...

869
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,400
...You do not know what
you're talking about.

870
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,600
Secondly...

871
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,900
...I hate the sound of your voice.

872
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,300
Thirdly...

873
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,800
...Why don't you just fuck off?

874
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,200
I mean, really!

875
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,500
Fuck off!

876
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,700
Wakey wakey.
Hands off snakey!

877
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
What the fuck is that?

878
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,200
A statement of fact.
What do you think it is?

879
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,200
And what's this with your mother anyway?

880
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
Well if it's not her...

881
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,000
...Then you.

882
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,200
Great.

883
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,500
Okay,
...You.

884
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,900
You think you're so smart,
but youre just fuckin' mad!

885
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,400
That's really good, Candy.

886
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,400
That's good, glad you think that.

887
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,500
Your a fuckin' poet!

888
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,500
<i> Once upon a time, there was
a Candy and Dan... </ i></i>

889
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,500
<i> Things were very hot
that year... </ i></i>

890
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,300
<i> All the wax was melting

892
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,900
<i> My Danny boy. </ i></i>

893
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:37,300
<i> Thousands of birds. The
tiniest birds adorned her hair... </ i></i>

894
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,900
<i> Everything was golden... </ i></i>

895
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
<i> One night the bed caught fire... </ i></i>

896
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,800
<i> He was handsome, and a
very good criminal... </ i></i>

897
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,500
<i> We lived on sunlight and
chocolate bars... </ i></i>

898
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,600
<i> It was the afternoon of
extravagant delight... </ i></i>

899
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,700
<i> Danny, the Daredevil... </ i></i>

cruise like sharks.... </ i></i>

902
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,800
<i> "I wanna try it your
way this time!"</ i></i>

903
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,400
<i> You came into my life
really fast, and I liked it. </ i></i>

904
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,900
<i> We squelched in the mud of
our joy. </ i></i>

905
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,900
<i>I was wet thighed
with the surrender... </ i></i>

906
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
<i>Then there was a gap in things... </ i></i>

907
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,800

909
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,100
<i>With you inside me...
Comes the night...</ i></i>

01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,100
<i> ... I gave him a name ...</ i></i>

01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000

927
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,700
My name is Daniel, I'm an addict.
I'm clean today, but not for much longer.

928
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
Get out.

929
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,400
I suppose I should do just that.

930
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,600
I am in my house Casper.

931
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,600
Promise me you'll stop.

932
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,600
Promise me you'll stop
before me.

933
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,800
<i> can talk to Dan Cutter,
Please? It's Jim Wyatt here. </ i>.</i>

934
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:34,100
Yeah Jim, it's me.

935
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,300
Hi! Candy's in the hospital.

936
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,600
What?

937
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,900
<i>She's suffered a bit of a nervous breakdown. </ i></i>

938
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,200
It's funny where it all ends up
isn't it?

939
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,300
Candy.

940
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,100
You okay?

941
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,900
I was so frightened.

942
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Sorry.

943
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,300
I didn't really understand
what was happening.

944
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,700
Candy?

945
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,100
Everything's dead.

946
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,600
Everything's turning blue.

947
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,400
It's hard through all this you know.

948
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,700
I don't care how wrong you've
been living about your years.

949
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:39,400
I care about my daughter.

950
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,300
What?

951
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,900
Whatever you're capable of...
whatever she needs...

952
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,600
Come on, we'll take you home.

953
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,300
Let him go.

954
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,500
<i>And that was it... </ i></i>

955
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,100
<i>That was all that was
scattered to the winds... </ i>.</i>

956
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,100
<i>Casper was gone... </ i></i>

957
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,300
<i> Schumann was lost... </ i></i>

958

959
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,500

The washer, Dan.

01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,400
World Championship washer.

965
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,100
One day, you'll wash for Australia.

966
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,900
<i> The world was full of
startling new concepts. </ i></i>

967
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,300
<i> I couldn't think.
I couldn't breathe. </ I></i>

968
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,300
<i>I was waiting for her
to come back. </ i></i>

969
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,300
<i> Because she was everything. </ i></i>

01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,200
<i> She was everything to me. </ i></i>

971
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,700
Hey Dan, you have a visitor.

972
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,100
Visit.

973
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,700
Just Tell her I'm not here.

974
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,000
Are you crazy?

975
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,100
Tell her I knocked off.

976
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:25,400
Your friend is right here,
just come.

977
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,100
-G'day.
-Hey!

978
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,900
I thought it was tomorrow.

979
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:51,700
I couldn't wait.

980
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:54,500
Is that okay?

981
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Yeah! No, it's good!

982
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's just!
You look so beautiful.

983
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,500
It's all that country air.

984
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,200
So I finish in an hour.

985
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
Dan.

986
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,900

988
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,900
It's Okay.
Hey!

989
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:44,400
Hey, It's Okay,
I'm here now.

990
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,000
There's no going back.

991
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:11,500
If you're given a repreive...

992
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:16,000
I think it is good to remember...

993
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,500
...just how thin it is.
