1
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,045
Hazy sunshine through Wednesday.

2
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,749
And that's the 2:00 a.m. report.
You're listening to KMPC 710 in LA.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,331
The Mutual Broadcasting System presents
the Larry King Show...

4
00:00:55,705 --> 00:01:00,870
...network radio's most listened-to
talk program. And now, Larry King!

5
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,435
We're with Rex Reed,
film critic of the New York Post.

6
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,647
Give me the modus operandi of Rex Reed.

7
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:12,215
Would you rather watch a movie
in a crowded theater...

8
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:14,756
...or in that special screening room?

9
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,392
I like to see movies in the daytime.

10
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,487
I don't like to see movies at night
because I like to be fresh.

11
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:24,189
I like 10:00 a.m. screenings if possible.

12
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,896
I like to be in a screening room preferably
all alone. Although that rarely happens.

13
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:33,165
I don't like to go to these
packed movie houses at night...

14
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:38,604
... where they fill the theater with
all the secretaries from the film company...

15
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,741
...and all the secretaries' second cousins...

16
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:45,085
...because they want the audience
to scream and yell.

17
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:47,851
They're like backers at an opening night.

18
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:52,793
But what about that which Mel Brooks
told me, always needs an audience:

19
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,294
The comedy?
If you're sitting alone at 10:00...

20
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:59,694
-... watching a comedy--
-If it's really funny, I'll laugh.

21
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:03,705
I don't need 40 other people laughing
to remind me I should be laughing.

22
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:08,801
I mean, I don't respond very well
to mass hysteria anyway.

23
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,409
With Rex Reed, we're ready to go
to your phone calls.

24
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:14,608
We start with Cincinnati. Hello.

25
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,241
Hi. Good morning, Larry.

26
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,346
Rex, I wanted to tell you
that I think your forth rightness...

27
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:25,460
...is refreshing and your dry wit
and your humor, it cracks me up.

28
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:29,461
I like your opinions.
You usually agree with me.

29
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,294
It gets me into a lot of trouble
sometimes, though.

30
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,528
But do you care?

31
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,969
-Well, I used to a lot.
-Really?

32
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:41,375
I go back to, like today, I can go and see....

33
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:44,242
I'll let myself see a "P" or a "PG"...

34
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,979
...because I don't like to be
uncomfortable or embarrassed.

35
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,617
I saw The Black Stallion twice,
so you know where I'm coming from.

36
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:52,985
What's the question?

37
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,025
Sex, to me, is not a spectator sport.

38
00:02:56,292 --> 00:03:00,729
Are we going to see some good,
thoughtful, clean movies again?

39
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:03,562
You've had a few lately.

40
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:08,103
I agree with you. The imagination can do
so much more to build a scene...

41
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,399
...or to sustain an emotion.

42
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:14,101
I found a lot of the pictures
that I saw, growing up...

43
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,338
...much sexier than any of the things
I've seen today.

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,712
I remember The Fountainhead
with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal....

45
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,176
Linda?

46
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,221
She just looked at him.
You saw lust written all over her face...

47
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,724
...and they didn't take
their clothes off at all.

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,750
Are you sleeping?

49
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,327
Maybe we shouldn't move.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,195
Oh, God. What's the matter now?

51
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,797
Nothing. It's just time
to ask these questions.

52
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:45,568
We sold our house. We should have asked
these questions before.

53
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,677
All right, then I can't talk to you,
so good night.

54
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,509
Stop it!
You're just nervous about tomorrow.

55
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:56,312
You'll get the promotion. We'll move into
the new house and we'll be happy. Okay?

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,617
You should hear your voice.
It just fills this room with excitement.

57
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,257
I'm tired. Stop questioning.

58
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:06,426
We made a wise decision.
Let's feel good about it.

59
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,396
All right. Okay, good night.

60
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,198
Good night.

61
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:14,729
Why that house?

62
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,639
What?

63
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:21,107
It's too close.
Maybe we should have moved far away.

64
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,105
We needed more space,
and that house has more space.

65
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,911
The purpose of a house is more than space.
We could've rented a locker.

66
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:30,812
Also, we didn't get a tennis court.

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,417
We don't play tennis.

68
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:35,421
We don't have a court.
If you have a court, you learn.

69
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:38,949
Possibly some day we'll have a court
and we'll learn.

70
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:46,200
-Can I ask you something else?
-What?

71
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,667
How come we let the moving company
pack for us?

72
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:54,740
Shouldn't we have done it ourselves?
Maybe we're being irresponsible.

73
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:57,609
I don't believe you.
One minute it's a tennis court...

74
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:01,183
...then you're worried about
the moving company packing a box.

75
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:04,676
Sometimes I wish we were
a little more irresponsible.

76
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:06,221
What does that mean?

77
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,883
Nothing. Just get some sleep.
You'll feel better.

78
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:13,918
What do you mean, you wish we were
irresponsible? Are we too responsible?

79
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:16,793
Sometimes I think
we are a bit too controlled.

80
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,860
You do? We're too "controlled"?

81
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,069
How do you go out
and buy a $450,000 house...

82
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,503
...and get all the things you want
and not be controlled?

83
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:29,644
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:32,613
What difference does it make?
I'll go sleep in the garage.

85
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,984
-Don't do that!
-Why not?

86
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,609
I'm responsible.
I should be guarding the car.

87
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:38,984
You're insane!

88
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:44,483
I'm insane and responsible.
This is a potent combination.

89
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,357
I'm not sleeping in the garage.

90
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,059
What am I doing? I'm not an animal.

91
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,965
-What?
-I'm not an animal.

92
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,164
Come on, come to bed.

93
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,830
I apologize.

94
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,137
But don't call me names.

95
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:02,603
What names?

96
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:07,575
Calling me responsible is calling me what?
Old or stodgy or stuffed up?

97
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:10,546
I'm doing the best I can.
I don't know what else to do.

98
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,056
Also, you're not so irresponsible yourself.
Look at your job.

99
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:16,682
Personnel Director is like in a Nazi camp.

100
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,092
If you hire one person they don't like,
they fire you.

101
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,665
You're upset. I'm sorry I used that word.

102
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:29,467
After tomorrow, everything will be better.
I'm positive. Don't you think so?

103
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,396
You always say that.

104
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:36,305
Yeah, but for eight years it's been one way.
I've been this employee...

105
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:39,472
...and then tomorrow,
I'll get this promotion and that's it.

106
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:42,146
I'll have stock in this agency.

107
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:45,743
That makes me responsible.
Genuinely responsible.

108
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:50,420
Now I can be irresponsible.
I'm in a position of responsibility.

109
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,284
Do you know what I mean?

110
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:54,659
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Okay.

111
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:56,629
Good night.

112
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,179
How are you?

113
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,611
Well, I'm flattered.

114
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:20,946
That's more!

115
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:26,352
Come over to our new house
and we'll barbeque. Let's celebrate this.

116
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:31,994
Ribs, fish, I don't care. Anything.

117
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,603
Did you ever barbeque--

118
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,228
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

119
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:39,331
I'm on my way to meet Mr. Taft.
Can you be there in 20 minutes?

120
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:43,344
I can't pick tile out this morning.
It's the biggest day of my life!

121
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:46,609
-We said we'd do this together.
-I can't do it.

122
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:48,343
You're in the kitchen more than me.

123
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,875
I don't think about anything in the kitchen.
It's your kitchen.

124
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,683
-Now we're angry.
-No, I'm not.

125
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:57,658
-Good luck and you'll get your promotion.
-Think about this.

126
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,055
-Good luck.
-Okay.

127
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:05,623
How are you?

128
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:50,042
-Good morning, Sylvia.
-Good morning.

129
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,544
Hi. Are you Bob?

130
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,842
-Bob? No.
-Sorry.

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,901
Well, I thought it was rude.
Got to go. 'Bye.

132
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,237
-Good morning.
-How are you?

133
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,773
-Your meeting is in 25 minutes.
-I'm very nervous.

134
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,672
-You look great.
-You do, too.

135
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:23,507
No calls at all. I really want to be alone.

136
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,171
Get me the Mercedes place.

137
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,448
-Hi.
-Hi.

138
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:11,688
So?

139
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:13,959
-Is it beautiful?
-What?

140
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,294
The kitchen. What does it look like?

141
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,697
I chose an orange tile.

142
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,866
-Orange.
-Yeah, burnt orange.

143
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,064
Sounds pretty.

144
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:25,998
Patty, would you close the door?

145
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:30,904
What's the matter?

146
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,143
I'm going to hate this house.

147
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:36,618
What are you talking about?

148
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:39,380
This morning, after the contractor left,
I was all alone.

149
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:43,687
I sat in the middle of the living room floor.
I got so sad.

150
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,951
A preview of the next ten years.
I just started shaking.

151
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:51,733
I don't like anything anymore.
I don't like my life, my house, anything.

152
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:52,859
What do you mean?

153
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:57,838
Nothing's changing. I'm not. David's not.
We've just stopped. Life's just going by.

154
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,303
He genuinely believes...

155
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:03,072
...that this promotion
will change everything. But...

156
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:06,171
...he believed that every single promotion
and it never does.

157
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,148
Things are always the same.

158
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,781
Maybe this time it will change.

159
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,451
-And if it won't?
-Then it won't.

160
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,656
Then you get divorced.
Do whatever you have to do.

161
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,528
This is Hans. Hold on, please.

162
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,860
I've been holding most of the morning.

163
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:28,561
This is Hans.

164
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:29,962
David Howard.

165
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,599
-How are you, David?
-Okay. Listen.

166
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm closing in on a decision.
The beige is the best interior.

167
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:42,283
I think with the dark brown, that's...

168
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:45,279
-...the best combination.
-That's the most beautiful.

169
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,288
All right, so tell me again...

170
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:52,656
...everything: tax, license,
out the door, in my garage--

171
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:56,892
I don't know where your garage is,
but it's $44,420.

172
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,498
It's a lot of money for a car.

173
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,594
It's not a car. It's a Mercedes--

174
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,697
I know it's a Mercedes,
but it's still a lot of money.

175
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,834
Maybe you shouldn't buy the car.
Get a Nova.

176
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:13,676
There are no extras, right? At that price,
I shouldn't have to add anything.

177
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:16,251
You just have to add leather.

178
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,081
-lt doesn't come with leather?
-No, that's why I said you have to add it.

179
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,320
-What's in there?
-It's called "Mercedes leather."

180
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,020
What would that be?

181
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,825
It's a thick vinyl. Beautiful seat.
I'd prefer that.

182
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,900
-Let's call it "that" then.
-Beautiful, thick vinyl seat.

183
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,768
Wouldn't you think
there'd be leather in there?

184
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,328
If you buy the car, I'll put some shoes in it.

185
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,476
All right. Thank you.

186
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,375
I'll see you when? Tomorrow night?

187
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:47,610
I don't know. I'll think about it.
Talk with my wife. It's a big decision.

188
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,512
How about Friday morning?

189
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,779
I can't commit to any day right now.
Certainly not this week.

190
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,313
You'll lose the car. I have stars coming in.

191
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,493
Let me just call you back, all right?

192
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:01,256
Hold on a second. I'm being buzzed.

193
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,460
It's time for your meeting.

194
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,704
Hans is on the phone. He's coming in
for the kill. Want to help me out?

195
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:12,866
Oh, no!

196
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:26,921
He'll call you back.

197
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:29,490
-Good luck, you got it.
-This is it.

198
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,052
I understand, but it's really impossible
right now. I can call you....

199
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,049
-Good morning.
-Hi.

200
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,151
Go on in, he's expecting you.

201
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,651
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

202
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:12,624
Say hi to Brad Tooley.
Brad, David Howard.

203
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,770
Brad just joined the agency in the East.

204
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:21,042
One of the top men at Doyle Dane.
He's fantastic, we're lucky to get him.

205
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:24,977
I've got two of the best men
in modern advertising right here.

206
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,212
Brad was blown away by your stuff.

207
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,185
-Right, Brad?
-Very impressive.

208
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:34,584
The Knudsen campaign
was one of the best I've ever seen.

209
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,349
Thank you.

210
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:39,656
Brad has joined the agency
for a very special reason.

211
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:41,990
We're going to get Ford.

212
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:45,356
I can't believe it! Ford?

213
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,798
Trucks, too.

214
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,199
This makes us the biggest agency
in the world!

215
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:52,263
Puts us at the top of the heap.

216
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:56,609
I can't believe this.
What a week for us all! This is great!

217
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,610
-Now, David--
-Don't say it.

218
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:03,118
As Senior Vice President,
I'm here 24 hours a day. Don't worry.

219
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,050
I'm yours. I'll live on this floor.

220
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,782
You're much too valuable
to be Senior Vice President...

221
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:10,791
...but I do want you to move to New York
and work under Brad.

222
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,827
You two will be in charge of Ford.

223
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,362
You're going to have to hurry though,
you start in two weeks.

224
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,525
God, I'm sorry. I didn't hear....

225
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:19,965
You start in two weeks.

226
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:23,994
There was much too much information.
I'm Senior Vice President, then I got lost.

227
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:26,906
No, I've hired Phil Shubano
as Senior Vice President.

228
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,975
You couldn't. I don't understand.
I'm Senior Vice President.

229
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,075
No, Phil Shubano is.

230
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,281
Then what am l?

231
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:39,310
He's giving you quite a compliment.

232
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:42,789
I ask him for the best man he had
and he didn't hesitate for a moment.

233
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:47,487
He didn't? I don't want to go to New York.

234
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,297
I should get the position I deserve,
not be shifted to another account.

235
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:56,671
"Another account"?
This is not just "another account."

236
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:57,761
It's Ford.

237
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,799
I know it's Ford.
You have to keep your promise to me.

238
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,071
I didn't make you any promises.

239
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:07,115
We had lunches over and over for years...

240
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,045
...and you were grooming me
for Senior Vice President.

241
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:13,486
I've been here longer than Phil.
I've been here eight years!

242
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,149
Phil's been here less than two.

243
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:21,390
He's not as clever as you, he's more
of an executive type. I need you creatively.

244
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,689
That explains it, then.

245
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,897
By being clever and being here longer,
I get shifted to another account...

246
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:32,031
...and he, because of his low intelligence
and short tenure...

247
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:34,666
...gets this job
I've waited my whole life for!

248
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:39,407
You keep referring to this
as just another account. It's not. It's Ford.

249
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:44,444
Is somebody bursting in here
and saying "surprise"? You did this before.

250
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,044
I hate you for this.

251
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:49,522
Goddamn it, Paul. You caught me again.

252
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,592
Who is bursting in here? Who's doing it?

253
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,891
Nobody's bursting in.
I'm offering you something big.

254
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,394
I'm going to New York?

255
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,892
Maybe you should tell him
about the campaign. That'll help.

256
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,827
We have the rights to
New York, New York.

257
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,567
Don't. Not now.

258
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:06,903
Listen to this.

259
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,842
When I was on the plane,
I was thinking about this.

260
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,070
It should go something like:

261
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,442
"This little town car

262
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,350
"Will drive you away"

263
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,945
Killer stuff.

264
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,719
I don't want to hear this.

265
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,886
-"It's Ford"
-Brad, shut up! Would you, please?

266
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:30,129
Listen to me. I must get what I deserve.

267
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:33,835
This is unfair. I have been here too long.

268
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:37,463
Please, make me Senior Vice President,
then I'll do what you want.

269
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,029
You can't do this to me!

270
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,768
I thought you'd be thrilled.

271
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:45,007
"Thrilled"? If it's so thrilling,
you go to New York! I'll stay here.

272
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,241
I'll take you to the airport. I got a car.

273
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,710
Don't talk like that.
I come from New York.

274
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:54,051
Yes, I know, and you don't want to go back
because people steal everything.

275
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,183
I resent that. That's a cliché.
New York is the greatest city there is.

276
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,521
Shut up, Brad.

277
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:02,654
Your song stunk,
I hate your suit and I could hurt you.

278
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:03,925
That's enough!

279
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,660
No, I haven't started yet.

280
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,501
Let's pretend a giant mistake was made.

281
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:12,468
I'll become Senior Vice President
and get what I deserve...

282
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,271
...and I'll work on Ford and do a great job.

283
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,211
Now, let's bring in Allen Funt and end this.

284
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:20,076
The position is filled.

285
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:21,341
Well, fuck you!

286
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,608
That's it! Get out and stay out.

287
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:28,054
I spent the week calling my friends,
asking if they thought I'd get this.

288
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,190
Everyone said I was the best man.

289
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,022
Everyone said, "Don't worry."

290
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:35,359
Nobody would listen when I said,
"I don't think so."

291
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,796
Obviously, they're right. I'm the best man.

292
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,493
Phil Shubano is the groom!

293
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:43,402
There I am, standing next to Phil,
watching his life come true.

294
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,771
I know you're upset...

295
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:49,800
...and I can appreciate it.
I'm going to forget what you just said.

296
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:52,846
I'm sure you don't want to blow
eight years with this company.

297
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:53,609
Fuck you!

298
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:57,949
I don't think I can work with this man.
I'll go back to the hotel.

299
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,853
Brad, just relax. I can't either.
David, you're fired.

300
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:04,115
Fired? Oh, I'm fired!

301
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:07,723
This is great. How dare you?

302
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:10,388
I want my eight years back!

303
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,893
I've wasted my youth for you.
I'm wasted! I'm over.

304
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:15,503
Come on. I want it back!

305
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,096
I'm standing here until you give them back!

306
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:22,166
Better yet, I'll take things home. I want
your clock, behind you. Give it to me.

307
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,336
Get me Security, please.

308
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,346
He's calling the cops!

309
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,041
Right now, in my office.

310
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,948
-I can't believe it!
-I'm going to get a bite to eat.

311
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:31,280
I'll call you later.

312
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,116
You're making a big mistake.

313
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:36,123
You don't even know me,
you bald-headed fart!

314
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:38,420
That's enough! Damn it, David, sit down!

315
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,091
Listen to me.

316
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:43,290
I used to make fun of my friends
who went out to find themselves.

317
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:44,764
I took the business route.

318
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,893
So, I wind up here. I can't believe it.

319
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:51,528
What do I get? I get a transfer!
After all these years!

320
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:55,602
I can get that at a bus stop
without any qualifications.

321
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:58,541
By the way, our hairpiece secret is off.

322
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:00,577
Yes, sir?

323
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:02,549
Would you escort Mr. Howard out, please?

324
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,110
He does not have to escort me out.
I leave on my own, gratefully.

325
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,850
It's all right. I leave gratefully!

326
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:13,992
Before I do, I think the people in this office
ought to know what went on here today!

327
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:19,327
Don't have lunch with this man!
He'll want to take you to lunch. Don't go!

328
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,728
He'll tell you how good the future will be.

329
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,797
I've seen the future!
It's a bald-headed man from New York!

330
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:59,331
Maybe you should talk to Cindy about that.

331
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:01,535
She knows more about it than I do.

332
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,573
Maybe 3:15? Okay. Bye-bye.

333
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:10,444
-Quit. Quit your job.
-What?

334
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,851
-Quit my job?
-I did. You do it.

335
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:13,910
You quit your job?

336
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:18,483
I didn't really quit, I got fired.
But it was the same thing. You were right.

337
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,060
No more "responsible David." I'm free!

338
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:24,394
I was responsibly blind. I was a dead man.

339
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:28,459
I would never have used that word,
if I knew you'd have taken it so literally.

340
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,131
-I'm crediting you for saving my life!
-It was just a word!

341
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:34,735
They were jacking me off!

342
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,173
They were jacking me off.
I was on the road to nowhere.

343
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,778
Do you know the road?
It goes nowhere! You're on it!

344
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:45,647
It's a nowhere road.
It just goes around in a circle.

345
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,622
It's the carrot on the stick,
and the watch when you're 70.

346
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,681
Who was made senior vice president?

347
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:58,030
I don't care anymore
about school senior vice president.

348
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,591
I'm sick of being programmed like a robot.

349
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,836
-Phil Shubano!
-Why?

350
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,737
Phil Shubano,
the under-qualified son of a bitch!

351
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:09,505
Why? Because life isn't fair.
But it'll balance out.

352
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,105
He'll buy the boat I've had to look at
in that catalogue for three years.

353
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,945
He'll crash in Catalina
and die and seals will eat him!

354
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:19,044
-Come on, you like Phil.
-I'm just telling you what might be.

355
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:23,023
He won't die and won't be eaten,
but he'll never find his way back home.

356
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:26,358
-Quit. I'll wait right here.
-I can't quit now.

357
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,328
-Yes, you can.
-No, I can't.

358
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:32,026
Even if I wanted to, my boss isn't here.
There's no one I can quit to.

359
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,762
It's time to get out!
We have to touch lndians.

360
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,531
We have to see the mountains and prairies
and the whole rest of that song.

361
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,902
Let's make love right now.
I want to have sex with you right here.

362
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:44,502
There are people around.
We can do it later at home.

363
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,170
We'll do it later, okay?

364
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:49,613
We don't have any spontaneity.
You're right. Two responsible people.

365
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:53,552
Why can't we have sex here?
It's a room with a ceiling. Please.

366
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,685
Fine. Some people you fuck in front of,
others you don't.

367
00:22:56,758 --> 00:23:00,250
We'll find the ones
and we'll fuck in front of them.

368
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:03,324
-We're free. Quit right now.
-I can't quit my job.

369
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:04,558
Quit right now.

370
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,624
Fine. I'll wait outside.

371
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:08,660
Look, my boss isn't here.

372
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,171
Let's talk about this tonight, later,
at home.

373
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:15,232
I'm hyper. I'm on this high, but it's real!
It's real!

374
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:19,302
I've got things to do. I'll talk to you
tonight. I love you so much.

375
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,043
One last chance for a quickie. Come on!

376
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:33,486
Here's a three-bedroom ranch
on two and a half acres.

377
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:37,396
"Immaculate condition with a hearth.
$55,000."

378
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,532
God, that's really pretty....

379
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:42,899
"Country living, next to the farmhouse.
$129,000.

380
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,963
"Four bedrooms.
Two and a half acres, a pond.

381
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:52,043
"$49,000." That's better looking
than this house!

382
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:56,116
"Five acres in Connecticut.
$80,000." How can that be?

383
00:23:56,184 --> 00:24:01,144
Because it's there. If our new house
was there, it would be $200,000 tops.

384
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:04,624
We'd pay half of what we're paying.
Look at this.

385
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:10,623
"Two-family, Bay Village, barn. $55,000."

386
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,691
Look at that house. That's a usable attic.

387
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:17,599
When was the last time you've seen
a usable attic in California?

388
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:21,733
That's a usable attic. It's a room.
We have a fan up there and a mouse.

389
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,500
There's a lighthouse here.

390
00:24:23,912 --> 00:24:25,436
An actual lighthouse.

391
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:29,973
"Two bedrooms, kitchen, playroom."
How does all that fit into a lighthouse?

392
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,985
I've no idea. Go there and ask them.

393
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,547
Listen. This is what I've been doing
all afternoon. Tell me what you think.

394
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,252
Here it is. This is everything we have.

395
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,193
We got a ride on the inflation train
that you would not believe.

396
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,897
In 1978, we bought this house for $150,000.

397
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,996
If we sell our house,
and don't put it back into a behemoth...

398
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,301
...we have a $140,000 profit.

399
00:24:56,077 --> 00:25:00,104
It's money we would've never seen.
It would have gone into the other house.

400
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,908
If we pull out of the new house,
we'll lose $15,000 in escrow.

401
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:09,480
The best $15,000 we'll ever spend.
We'll have $125,000 left.

402
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:13,321
We liquidate everything.
Stocks, your father's bonds....

403
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:18,661
The minimum for both cars, $16,500.
I'm being very conservative.

404
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,701
Very conservative liquidation leaves us...

405
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,227
...$190,000 in cash.

406
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,041
We couldn't.

407
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,872
-$190,000 in cash!
-I don't believe it!

408
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,975
All we need is a motor home. A good one
because we'll be living there forever.

409
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,020
What does a motor home cost?

410
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:40,918
Guess who went motor-home shopping?

411
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,753
"Hi, friends. Motor homes for sale."

412
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,554
$45,000, complete, for a great one.

413
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,619
Thirty feet long, a bedroom, a bath...

414
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,689
...a kitchen, a microwave that browns,
a little TV.

415
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,833
Beautiful! Better than our new house.
It has wheels, too.

416
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,199
That leaves us $145,000 in cash!

417
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:04,737
Play devil's advocate.
Can't you live 20 years on $145,000...

418
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:09,045
...if you're living out of a motor home,
just eating and painting and writing books?

419
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:11,642
We talked about this when we were 19.

420
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:16,287
We kept saying, "Let's find ourselves," but
we didn't have money and so watched TV.

421
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:21,686
Linda, this is just like Easy Rider,
except now it's our turn.

422
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,023
We can drop out
and still have our nest egg!

423
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,359
That's unheard of!

424
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:32,195
And if we get as far as Connecticut,
and we like one of those farms...

425
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:34,704
...maybe we could put
a down payment on one.

426
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:38,036
We could buy the lighthouse
and the Cape Cod pond.

427
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,541
And still have money left over.

428
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,544
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

429
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,885
We really can do anything we want,
can't we?

430
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,879
Who's stopping us?

431
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:51,889
Nobody.

432
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,565
I'm getting Florida!

433
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:11,242
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention, please?

434
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,742
I'd like to make a toast.

435
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:19,843
To our beautiful friends,
David and Linda Howard. Good luck.

436
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,592
"Good luck"? He's a man of no words.

437
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:31,963
This is a real nice evening
to be here with...

438
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,089
...you folks.

439
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,126
I do have an announcement
I would like to make.

440
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,702
Although we have no destination and
we'll be roaming around the country...

441
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:46,873
...there is one place we're going to first,
and that's Las Vegas, Nevada.

442
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:52,887
Because I would like to,
if she will have me...

443
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:55,286
...remarry my lovely wife.

444
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,124
Does it fit?

445
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:04,462
We're both nervous.
I'm drunk, you might be nervous.

446
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,793
That's nice.

447
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:11,298
An 80-year-old woman
helped me pick this out.

448
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,971
But I couldn't tell
what she was pointing to.

449
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:20,470
I think it was that one. I hope so.

450
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:24,876
So, let me make a toast.
See if I can top Ray's toast.

451
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:29,016
To our wonderful friends...

452
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,684
...we will miss you.
Thanks for being our friends...

453
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,252
...and we'll think of you.
Thanks for giving us this party.

454
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:39,494
To you, thanks for remarrying me.

455
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:42,834
And good luck with me.

456
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:47,164
And to America...look out...

457
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:49,837
...here we come!

458
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:06,918
Come up front.
We're crossing the city line.

459
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:10,584
Hurry. This is historic.

460
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,421
This is a great kitchen.

461
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,759
Melted cheese.

462
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:24,932
-Microwave?
-Yeah.

463
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:28,501
-How long did this take?
-28 seconds.

464
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,066
Including the browning time?

465
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,736
Everything. Isn't that great?

466
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,446
Good browning element.

467
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:40,981
I've never really tasted melted cheese
until now. It tastes good.

468
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,912
I love our new kitchen.

469
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:45,591
The further we get from LA,
the better it tastes.

470
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:50,788
You know something? I'm nervous,
but I can't wait to marry you.

471
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:54,761
I just can't wait.
I'm just carried away by this.

472
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:56,492
Me, too.

473
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,505
Clara said the Silver Bell Chapel
is the cutest one.

474
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,369
I like that name.

475
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,000
We'll get there at 10:30...

476
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:05,639
...do it...

477
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,547
...then we're on our way.

478
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:11,641
Las Vegas, here we come!

479
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:43,515
-Bright enough for you?
-It's great.

480
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:30,929
Look at those bells. This is exciting.
I like it. Let's go!

481
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,727
-Aren't you tired?
-I'm excited!

482
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:36,229
I think we should do this tomorrow.

483
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,232
We're here. Let's do it now!

484
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:41,637
I think we should do it tomorrow.
We'll both be up and be fresh....

485
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:43,904
We should get married
at the crack of dawn.

486
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:49,013
Okay, great idea. We'll camp out
under the stars, we'll come back...

487
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,711
...we'll be the first couple of the new day.

488
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,047
Great. Let's do it.

489
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:56,014
Are you sure we want to camp out?

490
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,921
Yeah. Don't you want to camp out?

491
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:01,721
Why don't we make this
like a real old-fashioned honeymoon?

492
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:06,027
Let's go to the best hotel,
get a honeymoon suite and just celebrate.

493
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,599
We don't want to stay in Las Vegas.
It represents everything we left.

494
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,935
It's the worst money-grabbing place
in the world.

495
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,907
Just tonight. Wouldn't it be fun
to have room service...

496
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:18,840
...make love in a big bed
and watch porno movies?

497
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:20,446
Wouldn't that be fun?

498
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:22,438
Porno movies?

499
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:25,343
We want to touch lndians.

500
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,080
We will, but just tonight, then never again.

501
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,452
We can take a bath together
in one of those big tubs.

502
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:33,991
-You want to bathe together?
-Yeah.

503
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:38,629
We haven't taken a bath together
in a long time.

504
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,462
Will this make you happy?

505
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:44,127
It's yours.

506
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:21,932
-How are you?
-Good evening.

507
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,446
My wife and I have dropped out of society
and we were going to spend the night--

508
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:29,176
-Just ask him for the room.
-This is the way I do it.

509
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,649
We were going to camp out,
sleep under the stars...

510
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,851
...but we're getting remarried tomorrow,
so we wanted the best bridal suite.

511
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,684
Do you have a reservation?

512
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:45,630
I just dropped out of society.
I don't do reservation things anymore.

513
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,692
Well, we do. I'm sorry,
but the bridal suite is occupied.

514
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:52,528
It isn't occupied.

515
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,443
It isn't occupied. Give him some money.
We'll get the bridal suite.

516
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,537
-How much do I give him?
-$50.

517
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:01,713
Just give him the money.

518
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:05,684
I'll tell you what,
I've worked with computers in college...

519
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:08,984
...and I know that sometimes
they're complicated machines.

520
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:13,550
Why don't you run it through once more,
and who knows?

521
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:16,056
I think I know what you mean. I'll check.

522
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,534
No. It's occupied.

523
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:24,564
-Give him more money.
-I just gave him $50.

524
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,503
I can't. I'll give him all my money.

525
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,406
Just give him some more money.

526
00:35:30,244 --> 00:35:34,578
Just give him some more money.

527
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:38,852
I'm not good at this.
I don't get good seats at good games...

528
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,323
...and I've never gotten a ringside table.
It's just something I don't know how to do.

529
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:46,292
So to save time, how much do you want?

530
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,554
$100.

531
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:16,183
Oh, my God. Wait a minute.

532
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:27,131
I think this is a mistake.
We paid for a suite, so does this open up?

533
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:30,395
-The junior bridal suite.
-What?

534
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:32,462
Junior bridal suite.

535
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,143
I paid $100 for the best bridal suite.
Is there a senior bridal suite?

536
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:38,634
I don't know.

537
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:40,236
I gave him $100.

538
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,337
I don't know.

539
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:46,449
Can I get into this room?
Is there a big living room that goes here?

540
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,509
I don't know.

541
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:56,156
Could we get one large heart mattress?
I don't think you can push them together.

542
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,319
I don't know.

543
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:01,199
Thanks for the help.

544
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:10,569
What do you think?

545
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,113
If Liberace had children
this would be their room.

546
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:14,908
I'll check out the bathroom.

547
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:18,348
Cute little hearts.

548
00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:22,349
Nice bath?

549
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,021
There's no tub.

550
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:24,887
None?

551
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:27,626
There's just a tiny heart-shaped shower.

552
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:33,360
There goes the bath fantasy.
We've got porno movies and room service.

553
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,933
Why don't we go see a show
and have some dinner?

554
00:37:36,037 --> 00:37:39,370
Let's stick to our plan.
We'll eat in this room and be out at dawn.

555
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:44,041
I'm going to take a nice, hot shower.
It's going to be fun.

556
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:14,801
Sweetie, let's get married.

557
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,173
Sweetheart?

558
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:26,480
Linda?

559
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,646
You can't come in here dressed like that.

560
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:04,555
I saw Electric Horseman. An animal
rode through here with lights on.

561
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:11,692
Come on back to me, 22.
Come on back to me.

562
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,265
Come on, 22. Come on back.

563
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:19,738
What are you doing?

564
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:21,468
Not now, go away.

565
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,375
-How long have you been here?
-We're going for 22.

566
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,710
Twelve.

567
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:28,541
-Shit!
-How much did you lose?

568
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:31,078
How much was that?

569
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:34,744
One more time. 22.

570
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,585
Why are you betting 22?

571
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,180
We got to talk.

572
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:44,255
She's been here all night.
She's not on a lucky streak.

573
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:46,261
-How much has she lost?
-Talk to her.

574
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,891
-How much?
-Talk.

575
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,165
-The man says you're--
-What man?

576
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,399
-He says you've lost--
-I was down earlier.

577
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,738
-You're up now?
-I'm still down, but I'll hit.

578
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,974
You're going to bring me bad luck.
Stop it! 22!

579
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:03,580
Twenty-two.

580
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,913
All right! I'm sorry!

581
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,477
-How much?
-$35.

582
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:10,648
-We're up!
-We're still down.

583
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,157
-How down?
-Down.

584
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,256
-How down is she?
-Down.

585
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:18,287
-How down are you?
-Down.

586
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:20,299
-How much have you lost?
-Everything.

587
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:24,770
Everything! Everything on 22,
and make it happen for me.

588
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:29,142
-Twenty-two, come on back to me.
-Where did you get that number?

589
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:31,945
Double zero.

590
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,738
-Shit!
-You lost. It's gone.

591
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,480
What do you mean "everything"?

592
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:39,849
There's no more money!

593
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:42,013
She really likes 22, huh?

594
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:43,522
Stop it. Come here.

595
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,185
I'm going to hit on 22.

596
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:52,959
Good morning. May I help you?

597
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,263
We just.... That's fine.

598
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,274
Sit here.

599
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:06,303
What happened?

600
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:10,076
At 2:30 this morning,
this man said I was up $100,000.

601
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:13,086
Why the hell did you start gambling
that kind of money?

602
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:17,122
It was more chips than I've ever seen.
They were everywhere.

603
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:19,250
You had no chips when I came downstairs.

604
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:21,089
But I can get them back.

605
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,388
Stop it.

606
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,822
-The cash in the room, you took that?
-Yes.

607
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:29,598
-You cashed your personal checks?
-Yes.

608
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,430
-You didn't touch the traveler's checks?
-Yes.

609
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:36,303
The core of the nest egg?

610
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,340
How much is left of the nest egg?

611
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:42,405
Nothing. Give or take $1,000.

612
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,415
-"Give or take $1,000"?
-Yeah.

613
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:50,689
Oh, God! I can't believe it.

614
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:53,090
It's like a Twilight Zone.

615
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:57,858
I've never had this feeling before.
There were people rooting and cheering.

616
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,197
It was like being on another planet.
I didn't care.

617
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,362
I didn't have any problems.
Do you know what that feels like?

618
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,803
Why didn't you tell me when we married
you were this gambling-diseased person?

619
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:12,072
Why didn't you tell me?
Isn't that fair? Then I could've decided.

620
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:14,512
It's like a venereal disease.
You tell someone.

621
00:42:14,848 --> 00:42:16,338
I've only gambled twice.

622
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:18,650
This is the second time.

623
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:23,387
I can't believe it. What did I do?

624
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:25,882
Why did this happen? What did I do?

625
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:28,985
-You don't understand--
-Just a minute. I'm tracing my life.

626
00:42:30,998 --> 00:42:35,401
Okay, we can do something.
There's something that can be done.

627
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:39,166
Let me think. Let me just think.

628
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,474
If you pick up a keno card, I'll kill you!

629
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,778
Listen to me. You stay right here.

630
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,986
I'll go talk to someone.
I think I can get our money back.

631
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,416
Just stay here.

632
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:03,453
Don't move. I'll be right back.
Stay here. Stay!

633
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,522
-Why are you treating me like an animal?
-I'll tell you later.

634
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,624
Just stay!

635
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:20,814
How are you feeling?

636
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:23,782
If it's okay, I need to talk to you
privately, somewhere.

637
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:25,512
Come on upstairs.

638
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:37,196
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

639
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:40,990
Thank you for seeing me.
I've heard a lot about you.

640
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:43,227
What do you mean?
Who are you talking to?

641
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:47,297
I meant nice things. You have
a good reputation. You run a great casino.

642
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:50,574
-Thanks. Is your wife feeling better?
-Much better.

643
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:54,080
I'm going to present you with an idea.

644
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:57,311
Before I do, I'll fill you in
on my credentials.

645
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,820
I was creative director
for Ross & McMahon.

646
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,548
-You know them?
-No.

647
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:05,490
One of the biggest advertising agencies
in the world.

648
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,757
I was creative director on the West Coast,
so when I say I have an idea...

649
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,893
...you know I'm not a jerk.
It's my business.

650
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:18,035
My wife and I
have dropped out of society...

651
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:23,566
...and we were going to roam
across the country and "find ourselves."

652
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:26,302
Just like they did in Easy Rider.

653
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,669
Easy what?

654
00:44:27,948 --> 00:44:29,381
Easy Rider, the film.

655
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,742
I didn't see it.

656
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:33,745
Great movie. You got to see it.
It's historic.

657
00:44:34,488 --> 00:44:37,855
Anyway, my wife and l, we liquidated.

658
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,291
We put everything into this nest egg...

659
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:45,455
...and we were going to roam the county,
finding ourselves. Just being.

660
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,464
We lost our nest egg here.

661
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,031
I realize you lost a lot of money.

662
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:55,965
Your room and your food, comped. Free.

663
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:00,874
No, I didn't mean that.
That's not what I meant.

664
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:05,719
I'm going to tell you this idea now...

665
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:10,313
...and please, be secretive.
If another hotel hears this, they'll take it.

666
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:12,255
This is my business.

667
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:18,896
As the boldest experiment in advertising
history, you give us our money back.

668
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,092
I beg your pardon?

669
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:24,170
Give us our money back.
Think of the publicity!

670
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:26,672
The Hilton Hotels have these billboards...

671
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,871
...where the faces of the winners of these
slot machine jackpots are all over LA.

672
00:45:32,112 --> 00:45:36,811
I know that works. I've seen people
look up and say, "I'll go to the Hilton."

673
00:45:37,217 --> 00:45:39,549
Well, you give us our money back.

674
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,714
I'm just coming off the top of my head,
but a visual where....

675
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,555
If we had a billboard and the Desert lnn
handed us our nest egg back.

676
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:50,185
This gives the Desert lnn really....

677
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:52,796
Vegas is not associated with feeling.

678
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:57,263
First of all, those people on those signs,
they won.

679
00:45:57,571 --> 00:45:59,596
-You lost.
-But that's it!

680
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,771
That's the campaign.

681
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,542
What's the campaign?

682
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:08,305
You gave us our money back
because you reviewed our situation...

683
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:11,111
...and you realized
that we dropped out of society...

684
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:15,722
...and we weren't just gamblers,
and we made a mistake...

685
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:20,050
...and you gave our money back.
You would be booked for 10 years.

686
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,129
Then all the gamblers will say, "Go to
the Desert lnn and get our money back."

687
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:28,065
Not gamblers. You keep all the money.

688
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:33,237
It's just that my wife and I aren't gamblers.
That's the distinction.

689
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,273
We represent the few people....
There's probably no one else...

690
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:43,446
...that is going to come and have....
It happened. We're probably the only two.

691
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,813
We represent the people
who have taken the chance...

692
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:51,085
...and we made a mistake, and then
the Desert lnn corrects it and gives it back.

693
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:52,887
There is a warm feeling here.

694
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:55,723
But you don't think everyone
will want their money back?

695
00:46:55,796 --> 00:46:57,457
No, in the campaign...

696
00:46:57,664 --> 00:47:00,827
...you make a clear distinction
between the bold, my wife and l...

697
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,734
...and all the other schmucks
who come to see Wayne Newton.

698
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,069
I like Wayne Newton.

699
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:07,940
I said Wayne Newton?

700
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:11,535
I heard you say,
"Schmucks see Wayne Newton."

701
00:47:11,678 --> 00:47:13,839
I like him. That makes me a schmuck?

702
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:19,716
I'm stupid to use him as a dividing point.

703
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,721
I just meant all the people
that come here carefree...

704
00:47:23,056 --> 00:47:25,786
...on their way to see a show,
and my wife and I...

705
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:29,454
...who, if you knew us,
believe me, you would....

706
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,094
-You're bold.
-Yes.

707
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:33,032
So, what do you think?

708
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,432
I don't think the sign will work and--

709
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:39,871
The sign is wrong. A jingle.
A television campaign.

710
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,270
"The Desert lnn has heart"

711
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:46,902
That's enough.

712
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:51,181
The casino is our main means of income.

713
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:55,818
Not the coffee shop, not the show.
The casino pays all our bills.

714
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:59,120
If we give everybody's money back,
we can't pay our bills.

715
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,385
We can't change our policy.

716
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,622
Play a word game with me, this will do it.

717
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:06,029
-What is a hunting lodge for?
-To hunt.

718
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:08,993
-What do you do at a rest home?
-You rest.

719
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:13,506
We'll associate the Inn with something
lovely. You don't think of anything, huh?

720
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:17,235
Gambling. That's why people come here.
To gamble.

721
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:21,941
They want to hunt, they go to Wisconsin.
To rest, they go to New Orleans.

722
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:27,587
They want to gamble, they come to Vegas.
That's why it's "Las Vegas gambling."

723
00:48:27,854 --> 00:48:31,346
You see signs around here with guys
with guns shooting ducks?

724
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:35,723
It's a gambling place. They don't shoot
ducks, raccoons, beavers.

725
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:38,694
They come to gamble.
That's what we do here.

726
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:41,063
You're a nice guy, you make me laugh...

727
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:44,228
...but our policy is:
we can't give your money back.

728
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:46,770
Say goodbye to your wife. I got to go.

729
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:49,041
What about Miracle on 34th Street?

730
00:48:49,543 --> 00:48:51,511
-It's the Christmas movie.
-Yes, it was.

731
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:52,806
There was Gimbel's...

732
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:56,576
...who feared if they gave something up
they would lose.

733
00:48:56,783 --> 00:49:01,083
They wound up benefiting. He was afraid
he'd lose business to Macy's, but he didn't.

734
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,748
It's the same situation.
This costs you nothing.

735
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:07,453
To give us back our money is nothing.
You would be the one to benefit.

736
00:49:07,594 --> 00:49:08,652
Wrong.

737
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:12,963
In that movie,
Santa Claus took care of everything.

738
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:17,470
There was Macy's, Gimbel's,
but Santa Claus fixed the whole thing.

739
00:49:17,904 --> 00:49:19,394
We don't have Santa Claus.

740
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,032
Then we get him.

741
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:22,100
Who?

742
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:26,805
Santa Claus! We get him!
That's the ad campaign. I have the chills.

743
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,210
Santa Claus is on the billboard
handing us our nest egg.

744
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,112
We associate, for the first time ever,
Christmas and Las Vegas.

745
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,214
Las Vegas, a Christmas place to be.

746
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:40,816
We're finished talking.

747
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:05,016
I can't take this any more.
Say something. Anything.

748
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:09,518
Yell, scream, drive off the road.
Anything. Just stop being so quiet.

749
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,217
I'm fine.

750
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:15,825
I feel horrible. I can't apologize enough.

751
00:50:17,497 --> 00:50:22,161
You'll make yourself sick. I understand.
If I was you, I'd be furious.

752
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,432
But you just can't hold it in.
You've got to let it out.

753
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:27,572
I'm fine.

754
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,775
Obviously, I can't keep apologizing
for what I did, so...

755
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:37,210
...let's talk about what we'll do. Our dream
is the same. We just don't have money.

756
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:41,618
We should stop saying we don't have
any money because we do have some.

757
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:44,385
We have $802.

758
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:46,219
That's something.

759
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:48,984
Yes, that's something.

760
00:50:52,232 --> 00:50:55,565
I think we should make the rest of the day
as pleasant as possible.

761
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:58,193
We're headed towards Hoover Dam...

762
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:00,805
...so why don't we make that
our destination?

763
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,874
We could take a walk, maybe have a picnic.

764
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,468
Get some fresh air. Wouldn't that be nice?

765
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,109
-Is that what you'd like?
-Yes.

766
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:12,849
Fine. Hoover Dam.

767
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:16,843
Nice dam, huh?

768
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:24,752
You want to go first or should I?

769
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,259
-Are you hungry?
-No.

770
00:52:29,663 --> 00:52:30,755
I'm starving.

771
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:33,664
-You shouldn't eat right now.
-Why?

772
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:38,831
With the little money we have left,
let's not waste it on knick-knacks here.

773
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,137
If that's your attitude, why don't you
give me my half of the money...

774
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:47,579
...and you do whatever you want
with your half. That's the fair thing.

775
00:52:47,814 --> 00:52:50,305
"The fair thing"?

776
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:54,547
I can't believe it! That's it!
I have been too controlled!

777
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:58,986
You took our nest egg and broke it
all over the Desert lnn!

778
00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:03,691
You filled up the casino with yolk.
"The fair thing"! I was sleeping!

779
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,631
-Get it out. Fine.
-Don't treat me like I'm an insane patient!

780
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:11,228
Let's go back inside. You can yell at me.
But don't yell out here, okay?

781
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:13,534
Out here? Out where? We live here.

782
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:17,941
Get used to the cement, honey!
This is our house! Forever!

783
00:53:18,678 --> 00:53:21,340
This is it! We found ourselves.

784
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:25,415
We found ourselves
in the middle of nowhere, with nothing!

785
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:27,348
Where are you going?

786
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:33,156
Please come inside.

787
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:40,997
What is it?

788
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,227
Sit down.

789
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,626
-What is it?
-Just sit down.

790
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:52,077
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.
I'll make it up to you.

791
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,538
I'll make you breakfast in bed for life.

792
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:56,946
Stay away from the food. You'll lose it.

793
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:01,687
I just want to know how this happened.
I can't understand it.

794
00:54:01,788 --> 00:54:04,416
I just held things in so long I just burst.

795
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:06,453
What did you hold in?

796
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:07,491
Everything.

797
00:54:07,627 --> 00:54:11,119
You weren't the only one
whose life wasn't satisfying.

798
00:54:11,298 --> 00:54:15,098
I sat in that office for seven years
without a window.

799
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:17,495
Sometimes I felt like I was going crazy.

800
00:54:17,704 --> 00:54:21,140
Why didn't you wake me up and say,
"l think I'm having this problem...

801
00:54:21,308 --> 00:54:25,244
"...can I go down and lose everything?"
Then I could've helped and maybe said no.

802
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:29,747
I'm sure the Desert lnn has an all-night
shrink service, along with the spa.

803
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:33,044
Someone could've counseled us.
He would've said, "Look...

804
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:38,056
"...she's got to let it go. Spend $10,000
and rent the Goodyear blimp...

805
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:40,649
"...and have her fly around
and flash positive things.

806
00:54:40,727 --> 00:54:42,718
"Much cheaper, same result."

807
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,629
Why didn't you wake me up?
We could've talked.

808
00:54:47,968 --> 00:54:49,959
I didn't understand it until now.

809
00:54:51,504 --> 00:54:56,134
I'm glad you understand everything.
Unfortunately, I'm still screwed up.

810
00:54:56,776 --> 00:54:58,971
And we don't have the money to fix me.

811
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:03,146
You're fixed, and we have
a couple of hundred for me.

812
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:07,083
$100,000 for you, $100 for me.
I was sicker than you to begin with.

813
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:15,359
I guess it was my fault. Maybe I just didn't
explain the nest egg well enough.

814
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:18,454
If you had understood
that it's a very sacred thing.

815
00:55:18,765 --> 00:55:22,701
If you'd understood the nest egg principle,
as we will now call it...

816
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:25,465
...in the first of many lectures
you will have to get.

817
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:30,233
If we are ever to acquire another nest egg,
we both have to understand it.

818
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:34,408
The egg is a protector like a god,
and we sit under the nest egg...

819
00:55:35,048 --> 00:55:39,508
...and we are protected by it.
Without it, no protection.

820
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:44,350
It pours rain, the rain drops on the egg
and falls off the side.

821
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:46,716
Without the egg, wet. It's over.

822
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:49,853
But you didn't understand it,
that's why we're here.

823
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,362
I understood the nest egg.

824
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,296
Do me a favor. Don't use the word.

825
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:55,834
You may not use that word!
It's off-limits to you.

826
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:59,100
Only those who understand "nest egg"
may use it.

827
00:55:59,172 --> 00:56:02,471
Don't use any part of it either!
Don't use "nest" or "egg."

828
00:56:02,742 --> 00:56:06,508
If you're in the forest, you could say,
"That bird lives in a round stick."

829
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,372
And you have "things"
over easy with toast.

830
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:15,882
You know what I'd like to do?

831
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:19,287
I'd like to give you
a small punishment before lunch...

832
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:22,824
...and have you write 1,000 times
on the pavement:

833
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,629
"I lost the nest egg."
Come on, say it 500 times.

834
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:28,996
"I lost the nest egg. I lost the nest egg."

835
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:31,230
I'm starting it for you. Jump in anywhere!

836
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,534
"I lost the nest egg. I lost the nest egg!"

837
00:56:33,606 --> 00:56:35,335
Shut up on nest egg!

838
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:40,445
Let me tell you,
that's not how you drop out.

839
00:56:40,513 --> 00:56:43,448
If you're really going to drop out,
you do it with nothing.

840
00:56:45,085 --> 00:56:47,918
Where did you read that,
in The Las Vegas Guide?

841
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,683
I didn't read it.
Friends told me. People who know.

842
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:55,057
You don't know anybody who knows.
You don't know any drop-outs except us!

843
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:58,325
In Easy Rider, the movie
on which you're basing your whole life...

844
00:56:58,398 --> 00:57:00,559
...they had nothing. They had no nest egg!

845
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:03,500
Bullshit! They had a giant nest egg.
They had cocaine.

846
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,731
-That's not true.
-It is true.

847
00:57:06,106 --> 00:57:08,165
Linda, they sold cocaine.

848
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:11,437
Okay, wait a second. Wait.

849
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,807
I'm not going to stand here
arguing about an old movie.

850
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,849
I'll go back inside. If you figure out a plan
to make $800 last a lifetime...

851
00:57:19,953 --> 00:57:21,545
...knock on the door.

852
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:22,844
Forget it!

853
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:24,954
-Forget what?
-Forget everything!

854
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:29,324
The one good thing that came out of this
is that we forgot to remarry.

855
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:32,455
That's the one good thing,
and no one has mentioned that yet.

856
00:57:32,832 --> 00:57:34,299
What does that mean?

857
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:38,133
It means if we'd remarried
it would've been harder to get a divorce.

858
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:42,140
Now it's easy. I'll stay in Nevada
for six weeks and we're through.

859
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:43,775
You don't mean that.

860
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:46,340
You bet your life I do.
'Cause you know what?

861
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:50,712
I know you'll never let me forget this.
For the rest of our lives, you'll blame me.

862
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,216
So goodbye. It' over. I'm sorry.

863
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:56,646
Don't hitchhike here in Nevada.
I don't blame you for anything.

864
00:57:56,756 --> 00:57:59,953
You said get angry, and I got angry.
So it's over. Now stop it.

865
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,890
It's not over. You're still yelling.

866
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:05,863
I'm only yelling because you have
your hand out! Stop it!

867
00:58:05,932 --> 00:58:10,528
I have my dreams and I'll find somebody
who understands them and start over.

868
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:14,095
I understand your dreams.
Will you take your arm back in?

869
00:58:14,674 --> 00:58:16,904
-Linda, don't do this.
-Get in.

870
00:58:17,277 --> 00:58:19,177
-Linda?
-Goodbye!

871
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:23,579
Don't get in that car, goddamn it!
Don't get in that car! Stop!

872
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:54,636
I've lost a woman.

873
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:56,546
A whole woman.

874
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:42,689
Just sit anywhere.

875
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:54,434
She doesn't want to talk to you.

876
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:57,738
It's my wife. It's between her and me.
But thank you for the ride.

877
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,744
I said, she doesn't want to talk to you.

878
00:59:59,812 --> 01:00:03,339
Thank him for the ride,
tell him it was a family squabble.

879
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:06,878
You don't listen real good, do you?

880
01:00:09,555 --> 01:00:13,013
By the time I count to three,
I want you out of here.

881
01:00:13,126 --> 01:00:16,095
I don't want you to count.
We'll both go. Honey, let's go.

882
01:00:16,562 --> 01:00:17,995
One, two...

883
01:00:18,064 --> 01:00:19,361
-...three.
-Here we go.

884
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:21,525
Come on. We've got some fighting to do.

885
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:24,593
I don't want to fight. He's going to kill me.

886
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,306
Understand that this was my wife.

887
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,645
You remind me of everything I hate.

888
01:00:39,752 --> 01:00:42,983
I believe you. I understand.

889
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,382
-Call the police!
-Somebody call the police!

890
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:52,295
Call him off! I beg you! Help, police!

891
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,961
-Call the police!
-Somebody call the police!

892
01:00:58,104 --> 01:01:01,870
Call the police, huh? If I wasn't wanted,
I'd stay here and kick your ass.

893
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,169
When things cool down, I'll be back.

894
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:09,177
You're dead. You're history.
You're dead, pal.

895
01:01:09,515 --> 01:01:11,176
I'm dead, pal.

896
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,607
-This is all of it?
-Yeah. Are you okay?

897
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,838
I'm all right.
Next time, get a ride with a small woman.

898
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,344
Everything will be okay.

899
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:45,850
Weren't you scared?
What were you talking about?

900
01:01:47,653 --> 01:01:49,780
He was telling me his whole life story.

901
01:01:49,856 --> 01:01:53,792
He was divorced, kicked out of the army,
couldn't keep a job....

902
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,351
-He escaped from prison.
-What did he do?

903
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:01,197
According to him, those two guys
were dead when he got there.

904
01:02:03,035 --> 01:02:04,696
Well, I showed him, huh?

905
01:02:11,277 --> 01:02:13,370
Pity the man who chases me.

906
01:02:18,551 --> 01:02:19,916
That's not funny.

907
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:23,879
-You'll laugh soon.
-No, I won't laugh soon.

908
01:02:24,757 --> 01:02:28,454
An adult is not supposed to get
a bloody nose. That's for children.

909
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,230
-Don't make fun of me.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

910
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:40,065
It's beautiful here, don't you think?

911
01:02:44,277 --> 01:02:46,404
-Where do you want to go?
-I don't know.

912
01:02:47,814 --> 01:02:51,375
-Where are we?
-I don't know. We're in Arizona.

913
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,287
Want to go to Canada?

914
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,515
-Canada?
-Yeah! Let's live in Canada.

915
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,057
-The country?
-Yeah!

916
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:02,150
Do you know how much
it is to fill up a Winnebago?

917
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:07,088
It's Arizona or New Mexico,
that's about all we can do right now.

918
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,399
Preferably downhill from here.

919
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:13,632
I like Arizona.

920
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:17,175
We'll drive till we find someplace we like.

921
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:20,836
I think this whole thing
is a blessing in disguise.

922
01:03:20,947 --> 01:03:22,778
Don't start that. It's not.

923
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:25,443
-Well, I do.
-It's not a blessing in disguise.

924
01:03:25,518 --> 01:03:27,679
I don't know what it is, but it's not that.

925
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:28,981
Fine. You'll see.

926
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:35,624
Oh, Linda!

927
01:03:35,695 --> 01:03:37,788
-What's wrong?
-Look.

928
01:03:38,364 --> 01:03:40,594
We're in hell. We entered hell. When?

929
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:42,366
Maybe he doesn't mean us.

930
01:03:42,468 --> 01:03:44,868
He'll pull me over
to tell me who it really is.

931
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,337
Us?

932
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:51,473
It's us.

933
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:53,802
I'm stopping.

934
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,910
I'm driving a whale here.

935
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:13,655
-What's he look like?
-Bad.

936
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:20,529
I hate the walkup the worst. I hate it.

937
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,541
Can I see your license and registration?

938
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,634
-What was I doing?
-83 miles per hour.

939
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:28,373
83? My speedometer--

940
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:31,314
Could I see your license and registration?

941
01:04:36,322 --> 01:04:40,486
I just bought this and I know
that driving it out of LA--

942
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,721
Just your license, please. Thank you.

943
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:47,522
-Can I ask a question?
-Wait in the home, please.

944
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,700
Wait in the home, please.

945
01:04:57,944 --> 01:05:00,276
Can I ask you a question, please?

946
01:05:02,114 --> 01:05:04,378
Maybe I was going 70 or 75...

947
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:07,248
...but I don't think it's possible
I could go 83.

948
01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:09,521
-We have good radar.
-Radar?

949
01:05:10,122 --> 01:05:14,616
You can't use radar on this.
There's a metal ladder here.

950
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:18,390
It's like an antenna.
We get cable, we don't even want it.

951
01:05:19,966 --> 01:05:23,231
We have a microwave oven.
Wouldn't that do something?

952
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:25,894
Wouldn't that screw it up?

953
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,769
The dealer told me this would happen.

954
01:05:29,075 --> 01:05:31,236
He said I'd get a ticket for no reason.

955
01:05:31,944 --> 01:05:33,104
Hey, buddy.

956
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,312
Can I ask how much this will cost?

957
01:05:39,051 --> 01:05:41,212
$140 or $150.

958
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:45,254
We can't pay that. That is too high.
It's too much money. We don't have it.

959
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:47,419
This isn't a swap meet.

960
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:51,658
Did you see Easy Rider?

961
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:53,124
It doesn't work.

962
01:05:54,734 --> 01:05:56,725
You know, the movie Easy Rider?

963
01:05:57,603 --> 01:05:59,628
I can't believe you asked me that.

964
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:03,835
That's my favorite movie.
I started riding motorcycles because of it.

965
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,206
Why'd you ask me that?

966
01:06:05,277 --> 01:06:08,678
My husband has based his whole life
on that movie.

967
01:06:08,848 --> 01:06:11,282
Not my whole life.
Just the last couple of weeks.

968
01:06:15,021 --> 01:06:17,285
Remember the ending,
when they got blown away?

969
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:18,323
Great ending.

970
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,086
It made my day.

971
01:06:23,195 --> 01:06:25,686
Remember Jack Nicholson
with the football helmet?

972
01:06:26,132 --> 01:06:28,692
Yes. Nicholson wasn't supposed
to get that part.

973
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:31,498
-Really?
-No. He lucked into it.

974
01:06:31,671 --> 01:06:34,196
-Remember the scene in the commune?
-With the mimes?

975
01:06:34,306 --> 01:06:35,898
-Yeah.
-Great scene.

976
01:06:35,975 --> 01:06:39,570
Since we all have this in common,
couldn't you maybe let us go this time?

977
01:06:39,645 --> 01:06:43,604
That would be great.
This is like a club, isn't it?

978
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:45,882
Get out of here.

979
01:06:46,118 --> 01:06:48,552
Dennis Hopper wouldn't give
Peter Fonda a ticket.

980
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:50,714
Dennis Hopper couldn't find Peter Fonda.

981
01:06:51,357 --> 01:06:54,849
You were real nice. I appreciate it.
That's terrific.

982
01:06:55,194 --> 01:06:56,718
Did you see The Terminator?

983
01:06:56,796 --> 01:06:58,764
No, I didn't. Heard about it, though.

984
01:06:58,831 --> 01:07:00,799
You should see it. You look like him.

985
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:01,933
Thank you.

986
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,111
You're up $140.

987
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,241
Where are we now?

988
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,081
What does that sign say?

989
01:07:51,617 --> 01:07:53,949
Safford, Arizona.

990
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,815
My legs are asleep. Let's live here.

991
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:29,985
Kind of nice having young people here.
I like it.

992
01:08:43,102 --> 01:08:45,935
Four more, three more....

993
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,200
Head looks right and left and bend.

994
01:08:57,016 --> 01:09:01,350
Honey! Come on. Breakfast is ready.

995
01:09:03,122 --> 01:09:05,147
-You look nice.
-Good morning.

996
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:14,162
Last night was amazing.

997
01:09:18,337 --> 01:09:21,329
-Where did we get this?
-We brought it with us.

998
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,734
Here's your coffee. Some eggs?

999
01:09:27,346 --> 01:09:28,506
Cereal?

1000
01:09:29,548 --> 01:09:31,709
Let's save the rest of the food.

1001
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:35,745
What time did you get up?

1002
01:09:35,821 --> 01:09:38,984
I've been up for hours.
I've been all over this place.

1003
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:42,858
At the end of the road,
there's this sweet little creek.

1004
01:09:42,995 --> 01:09:45,657
The people, three doors down,
have this little garden--

1005
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:48,291
Doctor says I'm losing the sight
in my right eye.

1006
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:49,861
I can't hear you.

1007
01:09:50,002 --> 01:09:53,096
-I said, I'm losing my sight in my right eye!
-I can't hear you!

1008
01:09:54,206 --> 01:09:56,902
-I was thinking we could get a puppy.
-Puppy?

1009
01:09:57,977 --> 01:09:59,911
We have to get jobs today.

1010
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:04,181
We'll get jobs today.
It'll be great. This is the beginning.

1011
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,979
But for real. We need money.

1012
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:07,746
We will. Great jobs. Today.

1013
01:10:08,921 --> 01:10:10,548
We have no plan of attack.

1014
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,420
-I'm ready to go.
-What about me?

1015
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:15,483
-Maybe we should go together?
-No, we should go separately.

1016
01:10:15,594 --> 01:10:17,585
That way we can cover more territory.

1017
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,955
Be very careful. And get a very good job.

1018
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,460
Today.

1019
01:10:22,768 --> 01:10:24,929
I challenge you. I bet I get one first.

1020
01:10:26,205 --> 01:10:28,036
Loser sleeps under the home.

1021
01:10:29,275 --> 01:10:31,869
-Try to be back before dark.
-I will.

1022
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,475
Good luck.

1023
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,344
Buy a cheap lunch.

1024
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,172
Okay, bye-bye!

1025
01:11:58,797 --> 01:12:00,287
Excuse me.

1026
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,961
You scared me. Good morning.

1027
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:06,429
I'm interested in the delivery job.

1028
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:08,666
-For your son?
-For myself.

1029
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:10,234
For you?

1030
01:12:11,877 --> 01:12:13,811
-You have your own car?
-No.

1031
01:12:14,313 --> 01:12:16,838
It's a delivery job. You would need a car.

1032
01:12:17,116 --> 01:12:18,606
I have a motor home.

1033
01:12:18,684 --> 01:12:20,151
A motor home?

1034
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,748
You couldn't buy gas
with what I'd pay you.

1035
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,654
I thought maybe you'd provide the truck.

1036
01:12:26,725 --> 01:12:31,458
No, we don't do that. I was going
to get a high-school kid with a Rabbit.

1037
01:12:32,297 --> 01:12:35,789
I don't believe an older man
with a motor home would work out.

1038
01:12:36,335 --> 01:12:37,802
Well, thank you very much.

1039
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:42,336
You know, I should change that sign...

1040
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:45,342
...from "man" to "boy."
Delivery boy is more correct.

1041
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,871
Leave the sign alone. It's fine.

1042
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:50,775
Any high-paying jobs
in the immediate area?

1043
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:52,611
Let me think.

1044
01:12:54,686 --> 01:12:56,677
Not in the immediate area.

1045
01:12:56,855 --> 01:12:58,618
In the outlying area?

1046
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,556
I don't know of any high-paying jobs
in the whole country. Do you?

1047
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:06,361
I used to, not now, though.

1048
01:13:06,698 --> 01:13:08,165
A little down on your luck?

1049
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:10,201
-You don't want to hear.
-I sure would.

1050
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:17,098
There's the employment office
down the street, about a half mile.

1051
01:13:17,743 --> 01:13:21,235
It's a small building, but you can't miss it.
Maybe they can help you.

1052
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,803
All right. Thanks.

1053
01:13:36,795 --> 01:13:38,786
So, what can we do for you?

1054
01:13:38,897 --> 01:13:40,057
I need work.

1055
01:13:40,799 --> 01:13:43,495
What has been
your previous work experience?

1056
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:46,333
For the last eight years,
I was with Ross & McMahon.

1057
01:13:46,405 --> 01:13:50,774
The last four of those as creative director.
You know them?

1058
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,101
-No
-Advertising agency.

1059
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:55,146
One of the biggest in the world.

1060
01:13:56,615 --> 01:13:59,379
Before that I worked
in and out of advertising...

1061
01:13:59,651 --> 01:14:02,211
...nothing to speak of, for about five years.

1062
01:14:03,956 --> 01:14:06,049
I worked in a catering truck for...

1063
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:10,221
...seven months in Pittsburgh,
and made food.

1064
01:14:12,097 --> 01:14:16,090
I worked at a crisis center
for three months.

1065
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:22,565
Not dealing directly with crises,
more just answering the phone.

1066
01:14:22,741 --> 01:14:25,869
The regular phone, not the crisis phone.

1067
01:14:26,645 --> 01:14:29,512
In high school,
I worked at a stuffed-fruit place.

1068
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:32,311
We don't have to go back that far.
More recent.

1069
01:14:32,784 --> 01:14:35,412
Advertising. Eight years,
Ross & McMahon.

1070
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:37,512
What was your previous salary?

1071
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:42,684
$80,000 was the base salary,
and then I was on a bonus situation...

1072
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:46,595
...which would give me
between $15,000 and $25,000...

1073
01:14:46,698 --> 01:14:50,190
...depending on the year we had.

1074
01:14:50,602 --> 01:14:52,763
Generally, $100,000.

1075
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,164
$100,000?

1076
01:14:56,175 --> 01:14:58,200
Over what period of time
are we talking about?

1077
01:14:58,277 --> 01:15:00,404
-A year.
-A year?

1078
01:15:04,883 --> 01:15:06,350
-What's so funny?
-Nothing.

1079
01:15:06,652 --> 01:15:11,749
What brings you here?
Trying to double up on that income?

1080
01:15:15,861 --> 01:15:18,830
I've come here to live.
I'm trying to change my life.

1081
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:22,357
You couldn't change your life on $100,000?

1082
01:15:24,736 --> 01:15:26,897
Have you got any jobs for me?

1083
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:31,640
I don't have anything right now
that you'd be interested in.

1084
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,540
Check back with me in a month.

1085
01:15:33,645 --> 01:15:36,409
I'm very interested. What do you have?

1086
01:15:36,815 --> 01:15:40,979
Coming from your position and salary,
you wouldn't be interested in it.

1087
01:15:41,053 --> 01:15:43,920
You don't know me.
I might love it. What is it?

1088
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:45,820
A crossing guard.

1089
01:15:46,825 --> 01:15:49,157
-What is that?
-A crossing guard.

1090
01:15:49,328 --> 01:15:51,922
-At a school?
-Where else have you seen them work?

1091
01:15:52,097 --> 01:15:54,895
I didn't know if there were different kinds.

1092
01:15:56,735 --> 01:15:58,225
What does that pay?

1093
01:15:58,403 --> 01:15:59,870
$100,000.

1094
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,411
What does it really pay?

1095
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,509
It pays $5.50 an hour, plus benefits.

1096
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:12,149
The benefits meaning?

1097
01:16:13,018 --> 01:16:15,452
You get a ride to and from school
if you need it.

1098
01:16:16,622 --> 01:16:21,616
Do you have anything at all?
Something in the executive file?

1099
01:16:21,693 --> 01:16:26,357
Or maybe you have
a white-collar box or something?

1100
01:16:26,698 --> 01:16:28,393
What sort of box would that be?

1101
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,496
Just a box of higher paying jobs.

1102
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:36,334
I know! You mean the $100,000 box!

1103
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:44,474
I'm glad I could be your entertainment.
But I want to tell you something.

1104
01:16:44,549 --> 01:16:47,382
I made a statement.

1105
01:16:47,953 --> 01:16:50,012
-A statement?
-Yes.

1106
01:16:50,822 --> 01:16:52,653
Did you see Easy Rider?

1107
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:56,051
No. I saw Easy Money.

1108
01:16:56,128 --> 01:17:00,064
Rodney Dangerfield, I like him.
That "no respect" bit is funny.

1109
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:15,535
Hi, honey.

1110
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:27,622
-Guess what.
-A job?

1111
01:17:27,859 --> 01:17:30,419
-I won't know for sure until tomorrow.
-Doing what?

1112
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:32,359
I don't want to say anything but--

1113
01:17:32,431 --> 01:17:35,423
-Give me a hint.
-Assistant manager.

1114
01:17:36,134 --> 01:17:38,625
The manager's going to sleep on it tonight.

1115
01:17:38,704 --> 01:17:41,969
I won't say more. I'm superstitious.
I don't want to jinx it.

1116
01:17:42,174 --> 01:17:44,665
-I can't believe it.
-What about you?

1117
01:17:44,776 --> 01:17:46,107
I had some good leads.

1118
01:17:46,178 --> 01:17:47,577
Give me a hint.

1119
01:17:47,779 --> 01:17:49,872
I don't want to jinx mine either.

1120
01:17:50,048 --> 01:17:51,709
I understand.

1121
01:18:44,903 --> 01:18:47,565
Are you paid to sit on your ass? Let's go.

1122
01:18:47,906 --> 01:18:50,238
Get us across the street, retardo!

1123
01:18:50,509 --> 01:18:51,908
Don't call me "retardo."

1124
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,535
Come on, retardo!

1125
01:18:53,678 --> 01:18:58,308
Right now, sucker. Let's go, now!
Across the street, now!

1126
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:01,112
We ain't got time to wait.
We're already late.

1127
01:19:04,623 --> 01:19:07,456
You're goint to get hurt.
Just cross the street.

1128
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,520
Get off your bike and walk it
across the street.

1129
01:19:11,596 --> 01:19:14,588
Walk your bike! I'm warning you!
Walk your bike!

1130
01:19:15,233 --> 01:19:16,700
Do you come from the dump?

1131
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:19,900
I take no responsibility for your safety.

1132
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:22,633
Just die for us and save us the problem.

1133
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,832
Brillo pad, fathead!

1134
01:19:28,547 --> 01:19:31,710
I was a kid once. Get out of here, you--

1135
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:37,219
Come on, fast! Fast!

1136
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,514
Here we go, hey! Kill the child!

1137
01:20:27,973 --> 01:20:30,134
Hey, mister? Where am l?

1138
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:31,873
Safford, Arizona.

1139
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:34,271
Oh, my God! How do I get to LA?

1140
01:20:34,813 --> 01:20:36,974
-Do you know where 70 is?
-No.

1141
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:42,250
Go about three and a half blocks.
You see that "Stop" sign?

1142
01:20:42,687 --> 01:20:45,656
Turn left, go all the way down
until you hit 70.

1143
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:48,920
Get on 70. That turns into 60
and it takes you to Phoenix.

1144
01:20:49,461 --> 01:20:52,453
Let me understand that.
The "Stop" sign, turn left to 60--

1145
01:20:52,531 --> 01:20:55,193
What are you smelling?

1146
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,329
Is this interior leather?

1147
01:20:57,502 --> 01:20:59,663
Yeah, it comes with the car.

1148
01:21:00,138 --> 01:21:02,629
-It's nice.
-It's lovely.

1149
01:21:03,642 --> 01:21:06,406
I go down to the "Stop" sign, turn left...

1150
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:11,073
...go to 70. 70 takes me to 60,
then to Phoenix. Is that correct?

1151
01:21:11,716 --> 01:21:14,549
-Do you like this car?
-What's not to like?

1152
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:53,521
What are you?

1153
01:21:53,592 --> 01:21:55,526
A crossing guard. What are you?

1154
01:21:55,627 --> 01:21:58,721
I'm the assistant manager
at the Der Wienerschnitzel.

1155
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:00,631
The what?

1156
01:22:00,699 --> 01:22:04,760
The Der Wienerschnitzel.
The manager wanted to sleep on it.

1157
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:08,272
He said right after I left, I got it.
He didn't know how to contact me.

1158
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,501
That's the job you were waiting for?

1159
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:12,734
-You sell hot dogs?
-Yeah.

1160
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,340
This place is great!

1161
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:19,212
When you flush the toilet,
where does it go?

1162
01:22:19,451 --> 01:22:20,349
Who is this?

1163
01:22:20,418 --> 01:22:22,249
This is Skip, the manager.

1164
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:24,521
This is David, my husband.

1165
01:22:25,724 --> 01:22:27,021
You're the manager?

1166
01:22:27,325 --> 01:22:28,656
You slept on it?

1167
01:22:29,628 --> 01:22:30,720
He slept on it?

1168
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:34,187
How you doing?

1169
01:22:34,499 --> 01:22:35,659
Call me Skippy.

1170
01:22:37,936 --> 01:22:39,528
Linda told me what you did.

1171
01:22:39,771 --> 01:22:41,295
The drop-out thing.

1172
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,367
I really admire you.

1173
01:22:43,508 --> 01:22:45,339
When I'm old, I might do it.

1174
01:22:46,678 --> 01:22:48,373
Did she say what happened today?

1175
01:22:48,813 --> 01:22:50,940
He's tired. I'll tell him later.

1176
01:22:51,016 --> 01:22:52,916
No, I want to hear Skip talk.

1177
01:22:54,753 --> 01:22:55,913
Hello?

1178
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:59,683
We have this frying machine.
We didn't really know how to use it...

1179
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:03,784
...but the funny thing is we used it anyway.

1180
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:07,888
We put the oil in, read the instructions,
threw the fries in....

1181
01:23:09,534 --> 01:23:12,901
They were done. Serve them.
She comes up to me and says:

1182
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,232
"Skip, these fries are frozen."

1183
01:23:16,374 --> 01:23:20,674
So we look at them in the light
and we see they're frozen.

1184
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,076
A little bit of ice.

1185
01:23:22,347 --> 01:23:23,871
You were eating them frozen?

1186
01:23:23,982 --> 01:23:25,711
What do you want me to do?

1187
01:23:26,651 --> 01:23:30,052
The point is, she saw this minor detail
on the first day.

1188
01:23:30,789 --> 01:23:34,384
Do you believe it? You've got a good wife.

1189
01:23:34,659 --> 01:23:36,126
That's why I married her.

1190
01:23:36,194 --> 01:23:37,593
That's why I hired her!

1191
01:23:39,698 --> 01:23:41,461
I want to talk to her.

1192
01:23:47,472 --> 01:23:48,734
Don't get me wrong.

1193
01:23:48,807 --> 01:23:52,675
I've had a lot of fun these last two weeks.

1194
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:55,311
Things didn't go like we hoped...

1195
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:59,214
...but if we're still together now,
after what happened, we won't split up.

1196
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:03,214
That makes me feel great,
and I'm real happy.

1197
01:24:03,755 --> 01:24:06,588
Isn't that wonderful?
I told you this would be a blessing.

1198
01:24:07,058 --> 01:24:08,047
Right.

1199
01:24:09,394 --> 01:24:13,888
Given our age and these jobs,
we won't see another nest egg for....

1200
01:24:15,066 --> 01:24:18,058
Ever. We'll never see anything.

1201
01:24:25,443 --> 01:24:30,574
I think that there has to be
some better way to rebuild than this.

1202
01:24:31,449 --> 01:24:35,078
I thought of a plan
that might speed things up.

1203
01:24:35,453 --> 01:24:37,478
Maybe I should sound it out with you.

1204
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:42,292
Really? I was kind of thinking
the same thing, too.

1205
01:24:42,427 --> 01:24:44,122
-You were?
-I was.

1206
01:24:44,195 --> 01:24:46,356
-What is it?
-What was your plan?

1207
01:24:46,431 --> 01:24:50,697
My plan is not a plan, just a back-up.
What's your plan?

1208
01:24:52,137 --> 01:24:55,231
I was thinking that we go to New York
as fast as we can.

1209
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:56,933
