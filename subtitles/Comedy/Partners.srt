I'm saying that...

The cost of being friends
with you

has now officially
outweighed the benefits.

Yes. So would Louis.

Why aren't you at work?

Uh, let's just say
I had to get out of the office.

Oh, hey, I heard
you broke up with Ali.

Actually, I proposed to Ali,

Well, gosh,
that's wonderful.

Yeah. And then Louis
went and told her

345

that I was gonna break up
with her.

346

And now

No.
No, that's where it ends.

All right, I guess
I'll see you around.

Two hours in the gym
every morning.

Oh, I can't believe
he sent you here.

358

He didn't. Oh, please.
Of course he did.

You two do everything

You're a perfect couple.

In fact, why did I even think
about marrying Joe

after we had sex
for the first time.

You were totally
out of our league.

We were so excited.

I mean,

Well, that's easy.

No one in the world
loves like Louis.

I mean, I question
a lot of his decisions,

but one thing I never question
is his heart.

Ali, listen.

387
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:34,818
We were 12 when Joe's parents
got divorced, okay?

388
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,187
And... and he was so sad

389
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:40,023
that he stopped going to school
for like a month.

390
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,425
And every day,
I would go over to his house,

391
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:44,127
and we would
do his homework,

392
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:47,163
and I would tell him
which girls were getting boobs.

393
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,301
And I'd make him a panini.

394
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:54,170
Because I had to make sure

395

that my best friend wasn't
gonna get held back a grade.

but I'm not sure what it has to
do with... Ali, listen to me.

398

You've got to marry him
because I need to know

if I'm not gonna be around
to take care of him,

You're smart.

You're a bad cook,
but with a little effort,

you could learn
to be a mediocre cook.

all of that... you love Joe.

that it will last forever.

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,853
Aw. Thank you.
You drive-a me crazy.

472
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:36,422
Hey, come here!
You do!

473
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:38,090
I'm worth it!
I'm worth it.

With that hat
I hate.

475
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:41,126
Do we need to worry
about this?

476
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:42,761
I think we just
need to accept the fact

477
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:45,664
that there are four people
at this table but three couples.

478
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,300
Huh. I think
that's kind of nice.

479
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,869
Oh,
I still have my heart on.

480
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,306
It's not <i>that</i> nice.
