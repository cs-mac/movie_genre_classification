1
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:43,460
Good morning, New York.

2
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:47,088
Today we are talking about cheese
until the sun comes up.

3
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,466
Specifically, bouchon cheese.

4
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,261
I like to pair this with a nice '77 sauvignon blanc.

5
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:56,806
It's perfect for an intimate meal
or for a large gathering.

6
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,322
You will never go wrong with semi-soft cheeses.

7
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:13,948
Let us go to Scott in Crown Heights.

8
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,533
He has been wondering about Brie.

9
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:17,660
NASDAQ dropped its noisy effort

10
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:19,871
to take over the New York Stock Exchange.

11
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:21,706
It slunk away saying it became clear

12
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,792
regulators wouldn't approve a merger

13
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,628
of the US's two dominant stock exchanges.

14
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:29,756
I think we have Barbara in the Bronx.

15
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,133
She's got a question about cheddar.

16
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,885
Go ahead, Barbara.

17
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,889
You can have my rook, but I will take

18
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:39,891
that.

19
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:41,851
Boom.

20
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,729
It seems investors may be in for an equally wild ride.

21
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:51,820
Get that bike around back. Come on, empty the truck.

22
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:57,367
Hey, it's the man in the suit. Hey.

23
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,910
What are you doing walking on my side of the street?

24
00:02:58,994 --> 00:02:59,994
Very funny.

25
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,746
Punk-ass bitches walk on the other side of the street.

26
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:02,914
Same jokes as yesterday.

27
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:04,916
Walk by me again and I'm going to whoop your ass.

28
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:46,291
Good morning, Mr. Shaw. You are
looking lean and mean today.

29
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,042
This is why I love you, Lester.

30
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,711
You're the best liar in New York.

31
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:51,212
Morning, Mr. Shaw. Hiya.

32
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,630
Everything is set for your dinner party.

33
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,592
I'm sending up some bouchon paired
with a '77 sauvignon blanc.

34
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:56,801
Very nice.

35
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,469
If you don't mind my saying, are you sure you want

36
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,889
Secretary Lowe and Janet Ramsey
at the party together?

37
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:02,348
They were mentioned again on Page Six.

38
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,184
Jesus! I totally forgot they were screwing.

39
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,936
Yeah. Nice save, Josh.

40
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:08,229
What the hell would I do without you?

41
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,939
You would have to read the Post yourself.

42
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,649
No, I'm serious.

43
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,735
I am kicking the tires on a couple deals.

44
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,320
I might buy a hotel in Saint Bart's.

45
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,738
I'm looking for a GM.

46
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,323
I'm going to try and steal you away.

47
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,158
If I could bring Lester, we might have a deal.

48
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:22,160
Okay, deal.

49
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,621
All right. Have a good one.

50
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,164
Josh, one more thing.

51
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:27,290
What is that, sir?

52
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:28,875
Checkmate.

53
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,215
You got a security report for me?

54
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,761
Not much, Mr. K. A car alarm, two
homeless and a really loud dog.

55
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,387
Good morning, Josh. Hey, Rose.

56
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,639
How was your weekend?

57
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:44,891
Good. I was here. We steam-cleaned the garage,

58
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:46,643
had some killer take-out from Punjab Palace.

59
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,394
You are a wild man. That's me.

60
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,771
Mr. K.

61
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:51,105
Hey, Odessa.

62
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,608
My work visa's about to expire.
You must find me a husband.

63
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:56,361
Okay. Can I have my bagel first?

64
00:04:56,445 --> 00:04:59,447
I need a man before these pricks
throw me out of the country.

65
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,200
All right, and what about Manuel? He's a catch.

66
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:05,203
I tried. He couldn't handle me.

67
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:09,582
Okay. Rose, don't write that down.

68
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,917
Morning. Morning, Kwan.

69
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:14,045
We have birthdays in 3714 and 4399.

70
00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:16,965
The Jameson twins like the cupcakes from Magnolia,

71
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:20,468
Mr. Causwell likes the hot fudge sundae at Sardi's.

72
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,637
And Mrs. Hightower landed three days early

73
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,138
from Cairo, be here in an hour.

74
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,264
Does Mr. Hightower know?

75
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,225
Josh, a word, right now.

76
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,060
Yes, sir, Mr. Simon.

77
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,356
Where's Charlie? I got an empty concierge desk.

78
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,066
I think he's checking on Mrs. Cronan.

79
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,902
Now that's bullshit! Mrs. Cronan is at physical therapy.

80
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,779
He has got three minutes.

81
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,366
...can only be convicted if the
prosecution proves all the...

82
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,534
Miss lovenko.

83
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:46,703
Holy shit! What?

84
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,079
We do this thing, you and I,

85
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:49,622
where you pretend not to study for the bar exam

86
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:50,790
and I pretend not to notice.

87
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,167
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about, sir.

88
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:54,711
See, we're doing it. Doing what?

89
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:56,421
Right now, we're doing the thing,
where you pretend not...

90
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:57,505
No.

91
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:59,632
I know the exam is coming up this
week, so study in my office

92
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,342
during your lunch break, okay? Because I never use it.

93
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,803
Okay, but I'm not studying, so
it would not make much sense.

94
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,139
Wait. Shh! Hear that?

95
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,391
Someone is buzzing.

96
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,977
Hey, shush!

97
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,103
Everybody, shush!

98
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:14,397
Who's buzzing?

99
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,649
I hear it. It's faint,

100
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,985
it's muffled, but I hear it. Fess up!

101
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,194
Who's buzzing? Come on!

102
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,446
Who the hell is buzzing?

103
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,032
It's me, my bad. I had it on vibrate.

104
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,367
Josh, this is Enrique Dev'Reaux.

105
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,785
He's our new elevator operator.

106
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,870
I didn't hire you.

107
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:31,039
He's a quarter Cherokee, you know we need an Indian.

108
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,540
So give him a shot.

109
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,293
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kovaks.

110
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,503
I've spent the last three years working at the BK,

111
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,005
and I'm ready for the big leagues.

112
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,090
BK? What is that? A building downtown?

113
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:43,217
No, it's a Burger King in Times Square.

114
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:46,095
All right. Walk with me, Mr. Dev'Reaux.

115
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,182
The average apartment at The
Tower costs $5.6 million.

116
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,601
It's the most expensive real estate in North America.

117
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:54,103
We have the best views, the most
advanced security system,

118
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:57,857
keyless entry, 24-hour video vibration detection.

119
00:06:57,941 --> 00:06:59,442
But you know what these people are really buying?

120
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:01,819
White neighbors?

121
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:03,321
Us. The staff.

122
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:06,199
They pay for our full and undivided
attention seven days a week.

123
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,201
So there's no cell phones, iPhones,

124
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:09,911
BlackBerries, texting, tweeting...

125
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,121
They had a rule at the BK, no sex in the storage room.

126
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,539
Same as your phone rule, right?

127
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,126
No, not the same, because your dick

128
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,669
has to come with you to work, Mr. Dev'Reaux,

129
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,713
but your phone can stay at home.

130
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:23,091
So don't hide it in your pocket or tuck it into your sock,

131
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,926
don't tape it under your balls or stick it up your ass,

132
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,928
because, eventually, I will find it.

133
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,014
They never checked my balls at the BK.

134
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:34,685
Sir, you can call me "Enrique" or "Lil' Disco"
or "The Puerto Rican Mohican,"

135
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,895
that's my hip-hop name.

136
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,109
Morning, Judge Ramos. How did you do?

137
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:43,069
I ran the Reservoir, 15 flat.

138
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:44,153
Nice.

139
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:45,571
Where's Charlie? I need my cigars.

140
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,532
I think he took Mrs. Cronan to physical therapy.

141
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:48,741
I'll bring them up the second he gets here.

142
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:49,867
Thank you.

143
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:50,993
#NAME?

144
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:52,078
Hi, Lester.

145
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,872
What's invisible and smells like worms?

146
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:56,457
Bird farts.

147
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,084
We've heard that one before.

148
00:07:58,168 --> 00:07:59,460
Have a great day at school.

149
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:01,087
Morning, Mr. Hightower.

150
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,296
Ma'am.

151
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:06,259
Sir, that package you ordered from
Cairo arrived three days early.

152
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:07,593
Hmm. Yeah.

153
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:09,428
It's on its way from the airport right now.

154
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:10,596
Josh, can you have the chauffeur

155
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:11,848
pick us up at the back, please?

156
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,516
Already done. Thank you.

157
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,268
Darling, let's go.

158
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:20,982
That guy's daughter looks like a prostitute.

159
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,692
We're all about discretion here, Mr. Dev'Reaux.

160
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:25,361
Right, right. How do you guys split up the tips?

161
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,238
We don't. We never take tips at The Tower.

162
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:28,573
No, I don't really want to talk about it right now.

163
00:08:28,657 --> 00:08:30,241
Charlie. - Sasha!

164
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,702
Your brother's coming, I'm at work
and I can't talk right now.

165
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:35,663
You're 20 minutes late! Where
are Judge Ramos' cigars?

166
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:36,789
Right here.

167
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,000
Josh, I'm freaking out.

168
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:40,626
Can I help you?

169
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:41,752
Go.

170
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:42,837
What?

171
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,173
We just went to the OB/GYN, the
baby is in the third trimester,

172
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,675
its head is six inches wide, your
sister has a tiny vagina.

173
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,386
Everyone tells me to stop worrying.
I said, "Stop worrying?"

174
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,013
In labor its head is going to get crushed

175
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,806
or it's going to blow out your sister's vagina.

176
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,099
Don't say the "V" word in the lobby.

177
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,184
I called your Uncle Marty.

178
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:59,312
He said all the women in your family
have teeny tiny vaginas.

179
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,606
I've been covering your ass all week.

180
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,857
Simon is breathing down my neck.

181
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,901
What are you doing? I'm worried.

182
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:07,320
Did you hear what I was saying?
Simon is going to fire you.

183
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,448
Simon is not going to fire me
today. I got the red flowers.

184
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:11,532
Red flowers?

185
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,658
Yeah, it's Chinese New Year.

186
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:14,076
Mrs. Jin will be down here any second.

187
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:16,996
It's crucial the first thing she
hears be something positive.

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,206
Her entire year depends on it.

189
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,249
Mrs. Jin.

190
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:31,636
Happy New Year.

191
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,809
Did you see that smile?

192
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:42,396
Wanted to see me?

193
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,606
Yeah.

194
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,401
Fitzhugh is refusing to leave.

195
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,237
We've never had a forced eviction at The Tower.

196
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,572
If they drag Mr. Fitzhugh and his family into the street,

197
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,740
it's bad for all of us.

198
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,158
Why don't you talk to him?

199
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:55,451
This is your responsibility, Josh.

200
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:57,286
The bank comes in the morning. Get him out.

201
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,714
Mr. Fitzhugh, it's Josh Kovaks, sir.

202
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,182
Good morning, Josh. Are you alone?

203
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:19,267
Yeah.

204
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,486
Hey, did you see what the market did today?

205
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,282
Went up 106 points. Ask me why it did that?

206
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:35,366
Why?

207
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,660
I don't know, but I used to know.

208
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:39,412
That's why they hired me at Merrill Lynch.

209
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,624
Mr. Fitzhugh, you know this apartment
is now owned by the bank.

210
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,251
They'd like you to vacate immediately.

211
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:47,128
We told the kids that we were turning the apartment

212
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:48,879
into a park. Going green.

213
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:50,798
That's how we explained all the furniture

214
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,259
being sold and the tents in the living room.

215
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:56,846
Luckily, my children aren't very
bright, so they bought it.

216
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,890
But they have smart friends and
those friends are catching on.

217
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:02,310
Sir, the bank will be here tomorrow morning.

218
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:05,688
I went to Yale 20 years ago, and now I'm a squatter.

219
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,401
Can't wait for their reunion. "Hello,
nice to see you. I squat."

220
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,486
What about family?

221
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:16,324
No, I invested all their money.
They won't return my calls.

222
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:19,618
I'd sleep in my car, but they repossessed
it three months ago.

223
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:21,245
So, you see, I have to stay here,

224
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:23,789
because we have nowhere else to go.

225
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:26,542
It's illegal for you to be here.
You're committing a crime.

226
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:28,002
I understand that.

227
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:35,426
But we might be doing some elevator
maintenance tomorrow.

228
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:40,306
I'm thinking that the elevators will be shut down

229
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:45,478
and those people from the bank will just
have to come back another time.

230
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,942
Because, it's like you go down one.

231
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,448
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

232
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,201
Mr. Shaw, I see you met Mr. Dev'Reaux.

233
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:03,245
This guy owns his own island with
jet skis. How cool is that?

234
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,914
He's our probationary elevator operator.

235
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:06,832
He's still very early in the interview process.

236
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:09,335
Why don't we finish the job interview right now, Josh?

237
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:12,129
Suppose I ask you to pick me up a cheeseburger,

238
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:13,506
Enrique, what would you say?

239
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,007
How do you like it cooked?

240
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,593
The thing is, I like a certain kind of Brie on my burger,

241
00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:20,221
and they only sell it at Danny's
Cheese Shop downtown.

242
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:21,847
I'm on my way.

243
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:24,475
And the beef has to be grass-fed.

244
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,602
The best butcher shop in New York
is on Bleecker Street, sir.

245
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,230
Josh, hire him.

246
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:33,025
Yes, that was my gut, sir.

247
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,151
And, Enrique, one other thing.

248
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,404
I like to get my own burgers whenever possible.

249
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,697
I may have my own private island in Belize,

250
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:41,700
but deep down I'm just an Astoria boy like Josh here.

251
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:43,035
We come from the same neighborhood.

252
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,287
That's right, PS 104. Go Lions!

253
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,750
My first real job was shoveling horseshit
at Aqueduct Racetrack.

254
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,544
Don't you ever let me forget it.

255
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:52,878
I won't, sir.

256
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:58,342
All right, go downstairs and get a nametag from Rose.

257
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,344
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

258
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,810
Why don't we hit it tonight, Josh? Raise some hell.

259
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:09,979
We have to be back here in nine hours.

260
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:13,065
Remember that time you danced
on that bar in Times Square?

261
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,442
I almost fainted.

262
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,902
That's a drunken dream you had six years ago.

263
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:20,156
You were shaking your ass up there like Tina Turner.

264
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,450
Running half naked on Broadway

265
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:25,661
telling tourists you were Mustafa from The Lion King.

266
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:27,163
That's ridiculous. It never happened.

267
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:31,584
I was waiting to tell you. This is going
to be my last year at The Tower.

268
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:32,668
What?

269
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:34,920
In a few months, I'm headed to San Diego

270
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:36,672
to spend a little time with Lorraine.

271
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:39,884
I might even cruise around the world
with all the other old farts.

272
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,802
Wow.

273
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:45,556
That's great. That's really great. I'm going to miss you.

274
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,558
I'll be thinking about you, Josh.

275
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:48,976
Here's your bus.

276
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,312
Be thinking about how you danced on that bar.

277
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,314
Yeah! I got it all up here.

278
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:54,982
I don't know where you got that.

279
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,151
Circle of life, Josh. Circle of life!

280
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:06,619
Not many of you kill your own Thanksgiving turkey,

281
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,287
but you might want to consider it.

282
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,831
Shit, Rita, get your ass back in here!

283
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,999
I ain't going to be chasing you all around.

284
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,167
Goodbye, Slide!

285
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:14,919
Hey, hey, Rita, come on now, it's 5:30 in the morning.

286
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:16,504
Not little shit like this. Come on now.

287
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:18,130
I told you, I don't even know nobody named Maria.

288
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:19,882
Yeah, well, she sure as shit knows you, Slide!

289
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:20,966
It was a wrong number.

290
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:23,135
Then why did she ask for you, stupid? Why?

291
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,929
It was a wrong number! I just...

292
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:27,515
I don't know what you are saying, bitch!

293
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:37,775
Lester, it's 9: 15. Why is Mr. Shaw's car still here?

294
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:38,859
Maybe he's sick.

295
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,198
That black sedan has been parked there for two days.

296
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,866
Why no boot or ticket?

297
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,243
I called the cops twice.

298
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:56,544
Do you remember that morning robbery

299
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,963
at the International last year?

300
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:02,591
I want you to slowly lock the door and clear the lobby.

301
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,760
Stay calm.

302
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:11,433
Lock it down. Code Black on all doors and elevators.

303
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:13,269
Repeat, Code Black.

304
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:14,812
What's Code Black?

305
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:17,398
Are you serious? We talked about
it at the meeting last month.

306
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:18,941
Let me see the outside of the building.

307
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,067
I think we're about to be robbed.

308
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,152
There were four guys out there with guns.

309
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:23,487
Where did they go?

310
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,155
Let me see the garage.

311
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:28,325
Why is Stillman here? Laundry pick-up was yesterday.

312
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,244
Mr. Shaw asked us to call him.

313
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:32,162
Someone spilled wine on his tablecloth.

314
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:34,206
He's bringing it down right now.

315
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,667
Wait a second. Those are not the Stillman brothers.

316
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:41,338
Oh, my God, they're taking Shaw.

317
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,923
This isn't a robbery, it's a kidnapping.

318
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,633
It's a kidnapping! Call 911!

319
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:45,718
Yes, sir.

320
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:46,844
Code Black, Manuel! Code Black!

321
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:47,928
What's Code Black?

322
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,307
Hey! Whoa! Whoa!

323
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:53,892
Hey! Stop!

324
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,148
Shoot at the tires!

325
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,608
I only have my Taser!

326
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Hey, stop!

327
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:26,967
Watch out!

328
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,473
Move in! Move in! Move in!

329
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:34,308
Don't move.

330
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:36,894
Get your hands in the air!

331
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,523
FBI, show me your hands.

332
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,651
- Let's go. - Okay, all right.

333
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:45,069
Put them behind your back!

334
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:46,153
Take it easy.

335
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,739
No, get off him! He's the victim!

336
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,783
That's Arthur Shaw! He lives in The Tower.

337
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:53,243
He was bringing his laundry
down. They kidnapped him.

338
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:56,455
This was not a kidnapping, it was an attempt to flee.

339
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:57,748
What?

340
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,085
Arrest him and get him out of here.

341
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:04,463
Josh, do me a favor, turn off the
heater and cover the pool.

342
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:06,048
I hate to waste money.

343
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,014
Wall Street kingpin Arthur Shaw,

344
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,725
number 138 on the Forbes 400 last year,

345
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,145
was arrested today in Manhattan
while trying to flee the city.

346
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,314
Sources have confirmed that he'll be charged

347
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:24,358
with several counts of securities fraud

348
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:27,820
and an immediate asset freeze of Mr.
Shaw's holdings has been ordered.

349
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:30,155
Shaw's lawyers have called the arrest

350
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,324
another example of the Wall Street witch-hunt,

351
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:34,618
but sources at the SEC believe the fraud

352
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:37,413
in this case could be of epic proportions.

353
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,127
In this country you're innocent until proven guilty,

354
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:46,505
so no matter what you hear about
Mr. Shaw being a liar and a cheat,

355
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,258
or his entire business being some
sort of elaborate scam,

356
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:50,843
we simply don't know the truth yet.

357
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:52,761
I've got shoes to polish, Mr. K.

358
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,388
What does this got to do with us?

359
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:58,225
For the last six years, Mr. Shaw
was on the board of The Tower.

360
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:00,644
So we have to find a new board member?

361
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:02,104
No.

362
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:05,315
Several years ago at one of the meetings,

363
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,151
he was asked to do a favor for us.

364
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:09,111
He was asked to manage all of your pensions.

365
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:10,195
Pensions?

366
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,488
And he did.

367
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,532
He took us on even though it was a small account.

368
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:14,992
He agreed to handle it.

369
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:16,994
Who asked him to do that?

370
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,331
I did, Rose. I asked him.

371
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,211
Mr. K, what's left in the pension?

372
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,173
Kwan, all this just happened, so
there's no way of knowing,

373
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,758
and by the way, this could be a mistake.

374
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:33,177
How much, Josh? Tell us.

375
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:37,514
Right now, they're saying that anyone who

376
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,516
invested with Mr. Shaw has been defrauded,

377
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:42,519
and that more than likely, it's all gone.

378
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:44,271
There is no pension.

379
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,898
Wait, wait. Wait a minute. I'm sorry.

380
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:47,399
How did this happen?

381
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:48,984
The guy is the best in New York

382
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:50,903
and he promised he could triple our portfolio.

383
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:52,029
So they're going to get our money?

384
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:53,739
The guy had billions of dollars, right?

385
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,907
Of course, it's just a matter of time.

386
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:59,620
So we have to stay patient and be positive,
because it has to be there.

387
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:01,663
I heard on the news when they arrested Shaw

388
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:03,707
that he only had $600 in his checking account.

389
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,003
Look, some of you may need
some time to process this.

390
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:09,129
If anyone wants to go home,

391
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,757
I will call in a temp crew for the rest of the day.

392
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:14,051
I'm sure that this will all be cleared up tomorrow.

393
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:15,761
Can I ask you something, Mr. K?

394
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:16,845
Yeah.

395
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,597
Did he get your money, too?

396
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:21,058
Yeah, Odessa.

397
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:23,560
For the record,

398
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,563
I never asked anyone to triple my portfolio.

399
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:33,403
Just an hour ago,

400
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:37,491
a federal judge released Arthur
Shaw on $10 million bail,

401
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:41,537
on condition he remain under house
arrest at his penthouse apartment

402
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:43,705
on Central Park West.

403
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,998
Mr. Shaw, I need a statement from you.

404
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,041
You need to back off.

405
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,377
Can I get a comment please, Mr. Shaw?

406
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:50,712
You need to back off. Excuse me.

407
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:54,216
Here! Over here! Come on, Shaw! Right here! Shaw!

408
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,426
Shaw, can we get a picture?

409
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,137
Over here, Mr. Shaw!

410
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,061
We're taking Shaw and his attorney
up to the penthouse.

411
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:08,021
I need Mr. Shaw's personal security code.

412
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,898
24719

413
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:14,486
That was my street address on Steinway
Boulevard in Astoria when I was a kid.

414
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:20,993
My client would like access to the gym on 43.

415
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:24,246
Even serial killers get 15 minutes of exercise a day.

416
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,290
He has my permission to jump out the window.

417
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,668
The rules of Mr. Shaw's house arrest are simple.

418
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:32,921
Kovaks, no visitors without prior
permission from the FBI.

419
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:35,716
All incoming and outgoing mail
gets vetted by my office.

420
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,509
All food deliveries, packages,

421
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:40,387
cleaning, repairs, all that has to be
cleared by the agent on duty.

422
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,598
You tell your staff that this penthouse is now

423
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:45,100
a maximum security prison and
it will be guarded as such.

424
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,644
The FBI is in control of the elevator and this floor.

425
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:50,981
What the hell is this?

426
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,778
Agent Denham, that is a 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso,

427
00:20:56,863 --> 00:21:00,282
owned and raced by the coolest cat
who ever lived, Steve McQueen.

428
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,284
This was his baby,

429
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:03,744
and now it's my baby.

430
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,956
You got Steve McQueen's car
parked in your living room?

431
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,250
And here I thought you were an asshole.

432
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,127
I paid a million for it 10 years ago.

433
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:14,129
I wouldn't sell it for 10 times that.

434
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,590
We're 65 stories up. How do we get it out of here?

435
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,133
You don't.

436
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:20,344
This car was taken apart piece by piece

437
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:21,887
and reassembled inside this room.

438
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:24,097
This car will eventually be sold at auction

439
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,724
with the rest of your belongings.

440
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:29,061
Only if I'm guilty, Agent Denham, which I'm not.

441
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:35,025
If you leave this apartment for
any reason without my say so,

442
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,902
and you'll be remanded into federal custody

443
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:39,196
and forfeit $10 million bail.

444
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,698
You have yourself a nice day, Mr. Shaw.

445
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,326
Kovaks, will you come with me?

446
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,827
Josh, do me a favor, will you?

447
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:47,746
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

448
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,290
Make sure you handle all my food deliveries.

449
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,959
You're smart enough to know I'm innocent.

450
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:54,753
I don't want the help to spit in my coffee.

451
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,005
They wouldn't do that, sir.

452
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:58,924
Yeah, but you get it, right?

453
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,051
Do it as a favor to me.

454
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:05,305
Sorry, we don't accept tips at The Tower.

455
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:08,809
Right, I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget the rules.

456
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:17,567
Why did you let him get away with that?

457
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:21,154
When he made that crack about
the help spitting in his coffee.

458
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,824
You wanted to hurt him. Hell, I wanted to hurt him.

459
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,994
Sometimes residents say things they
don't mean. It doesn't faze me.

460
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:28,745
Either that or you got no balls.

461
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,871
What?

462
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:31,790
I'm out of line. I'm sorry.

463
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:33,333
I have balls, all right.

464
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,043
I'm sure you got big balls. Whatever.

465
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:37,462
I don't have to defend my balls to you.

466
00:22:37,547 --> 00:22:40,340
I'm just saying the guy stole from everyone
who works in your building

467
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,842
and it looked like you gave him a free pass.

468
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,802
Maybe next time I'll rip out his larynx,

469
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:46,805
but today I chose to do my job
as manager of this building.

470
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:49,182
Okay, my mistake, Kovaks.

471
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,727
Just that most guys from your block in Astoria

472
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:52,894
can't control themselves.

473
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,313
And most girls from Forest Hills
don't end up in the FBI.

474
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:56,690
That's where you're from, right?

475
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,033
Here.

476
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:09,619
This is where most white-collar
crimes are solved, the garbage.

477
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:11,872
When do you think you will be getting the money back?

478
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:14,124
I'm not really allowed to discuss the case with you.

479
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,126
But you're allowed to clothesline me?

480
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,878
I was apprehending a fugitive.

481
00:23:17,962 --> 00:23:20,172
He's only a fugitive if he's guilty, right?

482
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:21,339
Oh!

483
00:23:21,424 --> 00:23:22,716
Aren't you the loyal friend?

484
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,509
I never said we were friends.

485
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:27,137
You play chess together,

486
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:29,139
you're the one who asked him to invest the pension.

487
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:32,517
I get his mail, I open his car door,

488
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:34,644
I buy his cheese. We're not friends.

489
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:36,354
Let me ask you something, Kovaks.

490
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:38,607
If he's innocent, where's the money?

491
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:39,775
How should I know?

492
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:43,695
The same way you knew I was from Forest Hills.

493
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,030
You pay attention.

494
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,036
I just want to know what I'm supposed to tell my staff.

495
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,289
Is that too much to ask?

496
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:57,209
Tell them he's guilty.

497
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:00,545
Get on the car!

498
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,963
Hey! Hey, hey!

499
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,965
Come on, put your hands behind your back!

500
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,425
Come on, man, what's this about?

501
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,469
This is bullshit! Shit! That's police brutality, yo!

502
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,054
Come on now.

503
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:10,555
Man in the suit, you seeing this shit?

504
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,099
You're my witness. Take a cell phone picture.

505
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:13,642
Take a picture, man.

506
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:15,393
No, my cell phone doesn't have a camera.

507
00:24:15,728 --> 00:24:17,896
If you see Rita, tell her I said to call her brother.

508
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,648
Rita? Yeah, her brother's a bail bondsman.

509
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:20,816
Tell her I said to use that money

510
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,526
I gave her to get her teeth fixed.

511
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,486
Come on now, what you got
to be pushing me like that?

512
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:35,205
Ladies and gentlemen, the next Brooklyn bound

513
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:38,125
local train is now arriving.

514
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,919
Please step away from the platform edge,

515
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:45,382
especially when trains are entering
and leaving the station.

516
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:06,486
Hello.

517
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,823
Dr. Carr, dial 118, please.

518
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:14,536
Hey, what happened?

519
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,788
Lester tried to step in front of a subway train tonight.

520
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,666
An off-duty traffic cop was there

521
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,334
and pulled him back at the last second.

522
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,211
They have him on a 48-hour hold.

523
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:24,337
Where is he?

524
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:40,979
If you wanted a sick day, all you had to do was ask.

525
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:44,149
Seriously, I need you back at work.

526
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:46,776
I'm going to tell the doctor somebody pushed you.

527
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:48,528
It was a misunderstanding, okay?

528
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:52,616
I gave it to him, Josh. All my money.

529
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,743
I asked him to invest it for me.

530
00:25:55,745 --> 00:25:56,995
Shaw? Yeah.

531
00:25:57,288 --> 00:26:01,249
A couple of months ago, I gave him
everything I had, my life savings.

532
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:02,834
Six years working the back door

533
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,961
at the Waldorf, nine at the Carlyle,

534
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:07,631
three at the Pierre, 11 with you at The Tower.

535
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:10,884
That's 29 years of opening doors.

536
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:14,387
$73,000 and change, and I gave him every penny.

537
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:18,099
In a few months I won't have money for rent.

538
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,602
I can't retire now.

539
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,357
All those years of opening doors, year after year.

540
00:26:27,818 --> 00:26:30,987
Truth is, people can open their own doors.

541
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:34,950
Not the way you do it.

542
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,205
Lester, he's going to pay you back every penny.

543
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:42,374
I promise.

544
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:46,628
Josh, please calm down.

545
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:47,712
Hold the elevator.

546
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:49,339
You can't go up there.

547
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,091
You're acting like a vigilante. Move your hand.

548
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:52,425
I won't move my hand. Move your hand!

549
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,885
Relax. You're not using your head.

550
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,303
Hey, Charlie. Hey, Josh.

551
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:56,429
Hey.

552
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,640
So, they're evicting me this morning.

553
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:00,725
My wife already took the kids, wants a divorce.

554
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,477
So, if you need me, I'll be living in this box.

555
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:04,938
Can I ask you a question? You're a Wall Street guy.

556
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:06,773
When did Shaw realize that it was over for him?

557
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,651
Ten months, maybe a year.

558
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:11,987
I heard he was interviewing lawyers over the summer.

559
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:14,364
So if he took someone's money a few months ago?

560
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,033
Probably needed the cash to keep up appearances.

561
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,620
Throw his famous Labor Day party at the beach.

562
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,123
At a certain point, it isn't about securities fraud,

563
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,207
it's about catering.

564
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:30,922
Drop Mr. Fitzhugh on 59.

565
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,215
I'm going to the penthouse.

566
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,384
Wow! This is going to be good.

567
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:39,264
Don't get up. Whoa! Where do you think you're going?

568
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:40,974
We're just going to get the trash.

569
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,934
And the breakfast order.

570
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:44,269
Go ahead.

571
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:48,189
Takes a village.

572
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,489
Good morning, Josh, Charlie,
Enrique. How are you doing?

573
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,742
How was your Labor Day party this year, Mr. Shaw?

574
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:01,369
Must have been something, huh?
What did you serve? Crab legs?

575
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:02,912
Surf and turf?

576
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:06,207
I've always tried to extend you a certain courtesy,

577
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:07,792
but this tone you're using...

578
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:09,919
What tone? Who gives a shit about my tone?

579
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,255
What are you, some kind of tone master?

580
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:14,883
Josh, come on. I'm going to ask you one time, okay?

581
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:16,760
So you better think really hard.

582
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:18,428
Why did you take Lester's money?

583
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:27,437
He came to me, he asked me to
invest and I did. It was a favor.

584
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:31,107
Mm-hmm. $73,000? A favor? Everything he had.

585
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:32,901
Did Lester ask you to come up here?

586
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:34,235
Mr. Shaw,

587
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,946
a few hours ago, Lester stepped
in front of a subway train.

588
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:39,115
Oh, Jesus.

589
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,953
Here we go. What are you doing?

590
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:47,540
Josh, you need to listen to me. The FBI is lying to you.

591
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,666
Josh, put down the club.

592
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:51,461
Christ's sake, don't do anything you can't undo.

593
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:56,091
Investing money is a gamble. It doesn't always pay off.

594
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,051
Mr. Shaw, do you care?

595
00:28:58,135 --> 00:28:59,469
Josh, come on. No, really.

596
00:28:59,553 --> 00:29:01,930
Do you feel any responsibility
for what happened to Lester?

597
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:03,223
Of course I feel badly.

598
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,850
I had no idea he was going to lose everything.

599
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:08,311
Lester has been a part of my life for over a decade.

600
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:13,233
Then why haven't you asked me
whether he's alive or dead?

601
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,071
Josh, this car is irreplaceable!

602
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:19,823
Not like doormen!

603
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,325
They make new ones of those all the time.

604
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,829
Must be 50 new doormen coming
off the line in Michigan right now!

605
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:27,705
God damn it! Stop it!

606
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,582
Want some Brie with your burger? Here you go.

607
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:31,126
Josh, don't! Shh!

608
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,961
Want me to come work for you, huh?

609
00:29:33,045 --> 00:29:34,462
Want to steal me away to Saint Bart's?

610
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:37,048
Come on, let's go! I'm ready to rock!

611
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:39,384
Mr. Kovaks, let me have a swing at that shit!

612
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:42,011
No! Nobody touches this car but me.

613
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:45,348
You think Steve McQueen is the
coolest cat that ever lived?

614
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:48,518
Guess what? Today, Steve McQueen is my little bitch.

615
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:53,565
Ooh!

616
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:55,358
Ah!

617
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:57,026
Oh!

618
00:29:58,028 --> 00:29:59,446
Whoops.

619
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,202
Don't worry, I'll have the help come clean that up.

620
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:08,371
Let's go.

621
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:11,541
Josh, aren't you forgetting something?

622
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:14,210
My breakfast order.

623
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,925
Do you understand the shit-storm

624
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,260
that can be brought down on this building?

625
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:25,180
Shaw's lawyer will shove harassment,
destruction of property

626
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:27,640
and civil rights charges right down our throats!

627
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,184
Now, I don't care what Shaw did

628
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:30,977
or how much money he's accused of stealing.

629
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:33,396
And you know damn well I got murdered
by that son of a bitch!

630
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:35,815
But a line has been crossed, and a gang of vigilantes

631
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,525
will not be tolerated at The Tower.

632
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,735
You're all fired.

633
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:41,362
Hey, wait, hold on. Mr. Simon, they
had nothing to do with this.

634
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:42,572
They just followed me up there.

635
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:43,656
I don't give a shit!

636
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,575
Mr. Simon, wait a minute, my wife
is eight months pregnant.

637
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,827
You should have thought of that before
you walked in that apartment.

638
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,037
We went up there for Lester!

639
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:50,872
Lester's job is waiting for him when he gets out.

640
00:30:50,956 --> 00:30:54,042
Meanwhile, the rest of you, I want
you out of the building right now.

641
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:17,899
Um, the carpet cleaners are coming
tomorrow, they start on 44. Okay?

642
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:19,442
Bye, Joshie.

643
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,028
Good luck with the bar.

644
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,781
I don't know what you're talking about.

645
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:33,581
All right. Let's go, everyone. Back to work, okay?

646
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,631
Hey, Charlie, wait!

647
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:43,383
Wait. I'll call Sasha, all right.

648
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,467
I'll tell her you tried to stop me.

649
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:46,719
Please, don't do me any favors.

650
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,221
And, Josh, don't pretend to care now,

651
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:49,931
I know you always wanted to fire me.

652
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:52,392
That's because you stink at this job.

653
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:55,019
So I stink? I stink? Yeah.

654
00:31:55,104 --> 00:31:57,522
The guy who made Mrs. Jin smile
on Chinese New Year?

655
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,482
Mrs. Jin is Korean.

656
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:00,900
She's what?

657
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,068
That's why she was smiling.

658
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:03,653
She's not Chinese, she's Korean.

659
00:32:04,113 --> 00:32:05,446
And you believed her?

660
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:07,282
Yeah, she's Korean.

661
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:10,493
All right, Josh, maybe she's Korean.

662
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:12,328
Why are you whispering? She is Korean.

663
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:14,831
What's important is that she appreciated
the gesture I made,

664
00:32:14,915 --> 00:32:16,958
and that's more than I can say for some people.

665
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:19,836
Thanks for getting me fired.

666
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:48,072
Hey.

667
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:49,532
Hey. Thank you for coming down.

668
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:52,201
Yeah, no problem. You got something for me?

669
00:32:52,286 --> 00:32:55,455
Yeah. I probably shouldn't even be doing this,

670
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:57,206
because it violates everything I believe in,

671
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,626
but I have to get my employees' money back, so...

672
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,295
This is Shaw's travel schedule for the last 10 years.

673
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:04,922
It's his guest registry. Names of judges, politicians,

674
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:06,924
women, tail number of his plane,

675
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:08,718
hull identification number of his yacht,

676
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:10,553
names of his race horses in West Virginia...

677
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:11,888
Gill's Pride and Sunny Day.

678
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:14,307
Yeah, we have all that, Kovaks.

679
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:17,560
And eventually they're gonna
sell his planes and his yachts,

680
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:20,521
and his horses, and the bank is going to take it all.

681
00:33:20,606 --> 00:33:22,231
You guys were his smallest account.

682
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,942
I'm sorry.

683
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:27,612
It's okay.

684
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:31,115
Thought I'd give it a shot.

685
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:34,911
Kovaks,

686
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:37,580
you wanna get drunk?

687
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:41,959
Thanks.

688
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:44,504
I've got to be honest with you, Kovaks.

689
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:48,299
The last time I drank this much at
a bar I made out with a fireman.

690
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:50,551
Really? How long ago was that?

691
00:33:51,053 --> 00:33:52,261
Tuesday.

692
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:55,640
You know, you surprise me.

693
00:33:55,891 --> 00:34:00,144
I saw the security tape of you beating
the shit out of Shaw's car.

694
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:01,729
That was badass.

695
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:05,483
Yeah, well, badass is my middle name.

696
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,860
Nope. Your middle name is Marvin.

697
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,405
I know that from your file. Marvin.

698
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:13,449
All right.

699
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,494
That's my dead grandfather you're laughing at.

700
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,287
What else is in my file?

701
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:19,706
Oh.

702
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,417
I know the year your parents got divorced.

703
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:24,377
Your SAT scores.

704
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,045
You don't know my SAT scores.

705
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,964
540, math. 480, verbal.

706
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,300
I retook those. Your scores went down.

707
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:37,432
I have to tell you something,

708
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,892
and I really shouldn't be telling you this,

709
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,895
because it violates everything I believe in.

710
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,397
Mmm-hmm.

711
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,983
We still haven't found Shaw's safety net.

712
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:51,779
All these guys, they keep some cash
close by in case they have to run.

713
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:54,407
Shaw clears out all of his accounts three months ago,

714
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:56,534
20 million and change.

715
00:34:56,618 --> 00:34:58,786
But when we bust him, the money isn't on him.

716
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,163
Wait.

717
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:02,248
$20 million?

718
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:05,460
There's a chance we'll get lucky and find it.

719
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,672
And if we get lucky, maybe you can get lucky.

720
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:14,177
I'm not lucky.

721
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:16,429
You just have to be patient.

722
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:19,891
I don't really have time to be patient.

723
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:21,934
Well, if you're tired of waiting around,

724
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,187
you can always try the old-school approach.

725
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:25,354
What's that?

726
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:30,276
Grab some pitchforks and a couple
of guys and storm the castle.

727
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,528
They'd never see you coming.

728
00:35:33,113 --> 00:35:34,655
I have to pee.

729
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,742
Ooh! I'm gonna... I have to go.

730
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:39,118
Whoa, whoa. You can't drive.

731
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,453
I'm gonna get a crab.

732
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:41,537
Crab?

733
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:45,124
Listen, you violated three federal laws

734
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,834
when you beat up Shaw's Ferrari.

735
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:48,836
So what?

736
00:35:48,921 --> 00:35:51,839
So a lot of guys down at the bureau
want to buy you a drink,

737
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:53,382
and so do I.

738
00:35:58,555 --> 00:35:59,680
Bye.

739
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,474
Goodbye.

740
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:17,990
Manuel.

741
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:22,620
Sorry, Mr. K, I can't let you into the building.

742
00:36:22,704 --> 00:36:24,872
No, no, I just have to grab some
stuff out of my office, okay?

743
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:26,040
I promise I won't attack anyone.

744
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:27,124
I can't do it.

745
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:32,463
Or should I tell Mr. Simon about
you and the cougar in 2813?

746
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:36,342
Two minutes. Okay.

747
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:19,719
Hi, welcome to Shake Shack. What can I get you?

748
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,178
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

749
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:24,181
Welcome to Shake Shack. What's
shaking? We shake all day.

750
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:25,683
You like working here?

751
00:37:26,935 --> 00:37:28,144
I cry at night.

752
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:30,980
You said you know electrical engineering?

753
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:35,234
I'm on the phone with the police.

754
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,737
They have a cruiser in the area. Go away!

755
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:41,198
It's me, Mr. Fitzhugh. Can you open the door, please?

756
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,288
Hey. Hey.

757
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:49,415
Why are you staying in this motel?

758
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:51,500
I'm thinking of becoming a male prostitute.

759
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,419
I think I might have a better idea.

760
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:13,105
Sasha told me you took a job.

761
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,900
Oh, yeah. I'm using all the skills
you taught me as a concierge.

762
00:38:15,984 --> 00:38:18,235
Thank you very much. Hey, no spitting, blue shirt.

763
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:20,321
Suck it, douche bag!

764
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:21,739
It's not a bad job. Only problem is

765
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:23,783
I need 40 hours to get on the insurance,

766
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:26,035
it's hard to get shifts, but if I
don't get on the insurance,

767
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,411
it's probably gonna end up costing us

768
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:29,455
around $20,000 to have the baby.

769
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:32,083
So we'll probably have to sell it.

770
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:34,085
I need your help.

771
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:39,048
So you're saying you wanna rob
$20 million from Arthur Shaw.

772
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:41,258
Which you think he's hidden in a secret wall safe

773
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:42,885
inside his penthouse apartment.

774
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,512
An apartment which he's not allowed to leave

775
00:38:44,596 --> 00:38:46,931
and is guarded by three FBI agents, 24 hours a day.

776
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:48,015
Two.

777
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,266
And you wanna do all of this in a building

778
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:50,601
with the most advanced security

779
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:52,019
and surveillance system in the world.

780
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:54,647
A building which we've all been barred
from ever entering again?

781
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:57,566
Yes. How do you guys feel about that?

782
00:38:58,694 --> 00:39:00,486
Well, I've really enjoyed myself.

783
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,779
Thanks for the crackers.

784
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:03,906
Mr. Fitzhugh, I know the money is in that safe.

785
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,658
How do you know?

786
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:08,285
Because in 2003, Shaw remodeled.

787
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,664
He spent like 10 million to blow out
the kitchen, move the living room.

788
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:13,165
He even brought in some guy from China

789
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,583
to do a whole feng shui thing.

790
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:15,835
But he left one wall standing,

791
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:17,378
dead center in the middle of the apartment.

792
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:18,754
That's where he put the safe.

793
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,047
Maybe it's a load-bearing wall.

794
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:21,799
No. No, it isn't.

795
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:23,092
We have the same wall in my place.

796
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:24,844
We took it down when we first moved in.

797
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,013
The FBI can't find the money,
because he hid it in the wall.

798
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:28,264
I know it!

799
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:34,103
So you guys in or out?

800
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,438
Mr. Fitzhugh?

801
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,274
Come back to me.

802
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:41,027
Mr. Dev'Reaux?

803
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:43,821
You know how many weeks I'd have to
work at the BK to make 20 million?

804
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,157
18600

805
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:51,245
Charlie, come on.

806
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,706
Look at us. We're basically waiters.

807
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,751
That's what we do. We bring people
stuff. We don't take things.

808
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:58,419
You and I know the movements of every person.

809
00:39:58,503 --> 00:40:00,087
We know the schedules, deliveries and codes

810
00:40:00,172 --> 00:40:01,213
for every door and window.

811
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,716
We've been casing the place for over
a decade, we just didn't know it.

812
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,384
We didn't know it, because we weren't doing it.

813
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,927
But we were. No.

814
00:40:07,012 --> 00:40:08,804
Okay, where do the Lippmans keep their passports?

815
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,723
In the freezer. Mmm-hmm.

816
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:12,808
How many in vitro fertilizations did Miss Hansen have

817
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:14,560
before she gave birth to Jonah?

818
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,103
Six. See? We know everything!

819
00:40:16,188 --> 00:40:17,980
What's the pass code for Mr. Shaw's elevator?

820
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:21,025
I just press the PH button.

821
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:24,403
Come on, man. I need you.

822
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,572
Yeah, you need me, because you've got these idiots.

823
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:27,865
You think we're getting our money back?

824
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:29,658
You think Lester is getting his money?

825
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:31,410
I talked to the FBI. It's gone!

826
00:40:31,787 --> 00:40:33,871
So all this is about getting it back for Lester?

827
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:37,958
Yes! And Rose and Miss lovenko
and Manuel and you, you jerk!

828
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,212
Come on! Let's storm the castle together.

829
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:43,214
Oh, like when they went after Frankenstein?

830
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:44,673
No, it's a different kind of storming.

831
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:46,675
It's a storming where the peasants
take everything back.

832
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,135
From like the feudal lords and...

833
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,428
I'm in.

834
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,057
Holy shit! I'm in.

835
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:58,521
Well, now we're undefeatable, aren't we?

836
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,857
Josh, we're not criminals. We don't know how to steal.

837
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,193
It's okay, I know someone who does.

838
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:07,488
Crack four!

839
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:15,871
You must have been saying your prayers, Slide.

840
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,039
You made bail.

841
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:22,962
Slide.

842
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:28,634
Thought you might need a ride.

843
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,396
I haven't driven my Nova for a few months.

844
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:44,191
Did you know that in Spanish "No
va" means "It doesn't go"?

845
00:41:44,776 --> 00:41:47,987
That's why they didn't sell many in Latin America.

846
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:52,992
I didn't realize Rikers was on an actual island.

847
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:55,995
I thought it was more of a... I don't know, like a...

848
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,831
You know, like the way Puget
Sound is actually an inlet.

849
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:00,332
But they...

850
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:03,794
You hungry? Can I buy you some lunch?

851
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:06,672
Slide, what are you doing?

852
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:07,756
Tell me why you bailed me out!

853
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,009
Take your foot off the gas!

854
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,427
Answer the goddamn question first!

855
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:12,595
Slide!

856
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:16,265
Red light!

857
00:42:23,398 --> 00:42:24,440
All right, what's going on?

858
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:25,566
You wearing a wire or something?

859
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,775
Some kind of police undercover shit?

860
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,152
No, I'm not a cop!

861
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:30,112
Then you brought me out here for
some kind of freak shit, huh?

862
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:32,198
You want to stimulate my nut
sack. Is that what it is, punk?

863
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:33,574
No! Jesus!

864
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:35,993
Then what the hell we doing out here,
man? I don't even know your name.

865
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:37,995
I'm Josh Kovaks.

866
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,372
Man in the suit. We talk almost every morning.

867
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:41,957
How come you bailed me out, man?

868
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,586
I need help with something, and
I thought given our relationship

869
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,795
you might be willing to help.

870
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,714
Relationship? I ain't got no relationship with your ass!

871
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:49,798
Our history!

872
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:51,383
What history? I see you walking
by every now and then.

873
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:52,635
I say, "Hey, what's up, little biatch?"

874
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,053
Just another passer-by going by.

875
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:55,137
Just another nigger walking by.

876
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:57,389
You don't remember 1971? Mrs. Saltzburg?

877
00:42:57,682 --> 00:43:00,142
We used to get dropped off at her apartment
every morning for day care.

878
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:02,603
In 1971 I'm six! How am I supposed
to remember some shit?

879
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:04,605
Come on, Darnell, Mrs. Saltzburg!

880
00:43:04,689 --> 00:43:06,690
Heavy-set German woman, short goatee.

881
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:08,817
Man, you call me Darnell one more
time, I will beat you to death.

882
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:10,736
You don't remember Inch High, Private Eye?

883
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,446
Davey and Goliath? Remember Witchiepoo?

884
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,281
H.R. Pufnstuf. You got freaked out by her?

885
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:15,407
Remember that kid came over

886
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,993
and he stole my inhaler and I couldn't breathe?

887
00:43:19,412 --> 00:43:20,704
I do remember you!

888
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:23,082
You the little seizure boy that was
having them seizures all the time!

889
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,250
No, I never had any seizures!

890
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:25,668
They were minor spasms of the throat.

891
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:27,378
And I remember you would start
foaming up at the mouth

892
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:29,213
and your eyes would go crooked. It was very scary!

893
00:43:29,297 --> 00:43:30,506
There was no foaming. That was you!

894
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,341
A lot of people have asthma when they're kids.

895
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:34,260
It's not a big deal. I outgrew it. No. Seizure Boy.

896
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,470
You'd be on the floor rolling all around.
You was having seizures!

897
00:43:36,554 --> 00:43:39,056
Asthma doesn't cause seizures, all right?

898
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,975
Oh, really? Then how come nobody
wanted to play with your ass?

899
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,101
Nobody wanted to have naptime with you,

900
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:43,435
nobody wanted to do coloring with you or nothing.

901
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,478
Because of your little seizures

902
00:43:44,562 --> 00:43:46,021
and didn't nobody want to catch that shit!

903
00:43:46,106 --> 00:43:47,523
I'm gonna ask you one more time, punk.

904
00:43:47,607 --> 00:43:49,024
Why did you bail me out?

905
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:51,986
Because I have a job and I thought
that given your skill set

906
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,445
maybe you could help us out.

907
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,072
What kind of skill set is that?

908
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,034
Taking things that don't necessarily belong to you.

909
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:06,250
Oh, little Seizure Boy want to
try to rob somebody, huh?

910
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,877
What you trying to steal?

911
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:11,463
$20 million.

912
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,217
Let's go get something to eat.

913
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:26,353
Hey, guys, this is my friend Slide.

914
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:28,814
You kidding, right?

915
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:31,317
These ain't the guys you wanna try to do this job with.

916
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:34,445
Yes, this is Charlie and Dev'Reaux and Mr. Fitzhugh.

917
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:35,654
This is a joke, right?

918
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,905
This guy is the big time criminal?

919
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:37,990
Hey, what you say?

920
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:40,451
All right, guys, take it easy. He's totally qualified.

921
00:44:40,535 --> 00:44:41,994
He's been arrested a bunch of times,

922
00:44:42,078 --> 00:44:44,079
he pays no income taxes, he's
got two Doberman pinschers.

923
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:45,289
So let's show him some respect.

924
00:44:45,373 --> 00:44:47,458
So now we're like The Doberman Gang?

925
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:48,584
Like the what?

926
00:44:48,793 --> 00:44:51,503
It was a movie. They trained Dobermans
to knock off a bank.

927
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,048
Is that the one where Gregory Peck
was attacked by those dogs?

928
00:44:54,132 --> 00:44:56,508
No, that's Boys from Brazil with the cloned Hitlers.

929
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,552
Oh, shit. You guys ever seen Boys Don't Cry?

930
00:44:58,636 --> 00:45:00,721
When Hilary Swank plays that dude.

931
00:45:00,805 --> 00:45:02,097
That scared the shit out of me.

932
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:04,933
Wait, Slide. Sit down and talk with us for a second.

933
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:06,643
These guys ain't got what it take.

934
00:45:06,728 --> 00:45:07,895
I can look in their eyes and see it.

935
00:45:08,063 --> 00:45:10,064
First sign of trouble, they're gonna
be shitting in their pants.

936
00:45:10,148 --> 00:45:11,607
They will not. You don't know them.

937
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,108
You want me to prove it?

938
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:15,194
All right, listen up,

939
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:17,821
y'all got 15 minutes to go out there
and steal me something.

940
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:18,947
What do you mean?

941
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:21,158
You heard what I said. In this mall,
right now, each one of y'all

942
00:45:21,242 --> 00:45:23,660
go out there and individually steal
$50 worth of merchandise,

943
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:26,413
come back and put it on the table. Then we'll talk.

944
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,584
Okay, 50 bucks, no problem. Come on.

945
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:31,794
Can I go with you, Josh?

946
00:45:31,878 --> 00:45:33,462
No, you ain't going with Josh, you go by yourself.

947
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:34,546
Everybody going by theirself.

948
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:35,714
Anybody can't handle this, is out.

949
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,924
Okay. Guys, we can do this.

950
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,717
It's just shoplifting. You got 15 minutes, let's go.

951
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,719
And put your wallets on the table.
I don't want nobody cheating.

952
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,222
I don't want y'all to go buy the
shit and say you stole it.

953
00:45:43,306 --> 00:45:45,474
All right, come on, let's go.

954
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:56,485
This is a part of our Sexy Little Things collection.

955
00:45:56,569 --> 00:46:00,906
Oh, yeah, that's great. Love that. Yeah.

956
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:03,450
Would you like me to ring that up for you?

957
00:46:03,868 --> 00:46:07,204
No, I think I'll just live with it a little first.

958
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,720
These are very pretty Bella earrings.

959
00:46:23,805 --> 00:46:25,681
They're from our Timeless Collection.

960
00:46:26,307 --> 00:46:27,891
Do you have any studs?

961
00:46:27,976 --> 00:46:29,601
Yes, several.

962
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,061
Right here.

963
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:33,355
Do you have any hoops?

964
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,859
Sir, all of our earrings are on this display.

965
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,487
Do you have a catalog?

966
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:41,572
Uh...

967
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,533
I might have one in the back, let me check.

968
00:46:53,168 --> 00:46:54,293
How do those feel?

969
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:57,463
They feel a little tight. Do you
have them in a half size up?

970
00:46:57,547 --> 00:46:59,715
Yeah, let me check the back.

971
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:58,106
Hey, them two pairs of drawers don't cost no $50.

972
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,236
$12 scented candle.

973
00:48:03,738 --> 00:48:06,406
Okay, we'll get to work tomorrow.

974
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:08,200
Wait a minute. We all just proved ourselves.

975
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:09,785
How do we know you can really pull this off?

976
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:12,079
You each stole $50 worth of shit,

977
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:14,122
I stole $264 in cash.

978
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:16,792
Rule number one, never give your wallet to a thief.

979
00:48:17,335 --> 00:48:18,877
Later, bitches.

980
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:26,260
What are we doing up here, man?
My balls are snow cones.

981
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:27,469
Can I get my jacket?

982
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:29,388
Everybody shut up, right now.

983
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:35,978
In a robbery, things can change quickly.

984
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:38,939
It can go from hot to cold, just like that.

985
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:42,025
You have to be ready to adapt to the situation.

986
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,236
You have to be able to think on your feet.

987
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,155
I was on a job a few days ago where
my homie got shot in the face.

988
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:48,490
He's kidding, right?

989
00:48:48,616 --> 00:48:49,866
Get shot in the head, it's over.

990
00:48:49,951 --> 00:48:52,202
If you get shot in your head, it's over.
If you get shot in your face,

991
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:54,371
the bullet will go in your cheek,
then come out the other side.

992
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:55,789
Then what you gonna do, sissy?

993
00:48:55,873 --> 00:48:57,624
Die. I'm gonna die.

994
00:48:58,084 --> 00:48:59,626
I saw a television show once

995
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:02,170
about a guy who got shot in the head with a nail gun.

996
00:49:02,255 --> 00:49:03,880
He couldn't even remember how to chew anymore.

997
00:49:03,965 --> 00:49:05,382
He had to put everything in a blender.

998
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,092
Yo, he couldn't figure out how to chew,

999
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:08,510
but he could operate a Cuisinart?

1000
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:09,970
I don't think he operated it himself.

1001
00:49:10,054 --> 00:49:11,972
All right, could we just focus, please? It's 16 degrees!

1002
00:49:12,056 --> 00:49:13,515
That's right! Let's focus!

1003
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,933
Now, earlier today I taught you all

1004
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,602
how to pick a lock with a bobby pin.

1005
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:17,811
I want y'all to practice on this door.

1006
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:20,397
I've got bobby pins for all of
y'all. Here's your bobby pin.

1007
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:21,982
This is your bobby pin.

1008
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:23,900
Here's your bobby pin.

1009
00:49:23,985 --> 00:49:26,820
This is your punk-ass bobby pin. Take it!

1010
00:49:27,322 --> 00:49:30,365
You unlock the door, you won't freeze to death.

1011
00:49:31,826 --> 00:49:34,536
I'm gonna be inside having sex with Rita.

1012
00:49:37,123 --> 00:49:38,540
Who's Rita?

1013
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,585
To get in the building, we have to
avoid seven exterior cameras

1014
00:49:41,669 --> 00:49:45,088
and six doormen who work at two
entrance points in rotating shifts.

1015
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:47,549
Once inside, we'll be faced with four security officers,

1016
00:49:47,634 --> 00:49:50,052
who monitor a bank of 12 internal cameras,

1017
00:49:50,136 --> 00:49:51,762
as well as two floating security guards,

1018
00:49:51,846 --> 00:49:53,347
who vary the patrol route each day.

1019
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:54,473
If we make it through all of that,

1020
00:49:54,557 --> 00:49:55,682
we still have to get through this gauntlet

1021
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:57,392
of employees to get to the elevators.

1022
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:58,477
Questions?

1023
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:00,479
Yeah. Who's that girl in the red dress?

1024
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:02,147
She got the kind of titties I like to play with.

1025
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:04,399
That's Mary-Ann from sales. She's a lesbian.

1026
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:05,692
Okay, that's irrelevant.

1027
00:50:05,777 --> 00:50:06,985
Mary-Ann is a lesbian?

1028
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,862
She was married when she sold me my unit.

1029
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:11,031
She makes lesbian sex with Lynn
Rutherford from accounting.

1030
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:13,325
Okay... Lynn is a lesbian?

1031
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:14,534
Wait, I'm lost.

1032
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:16,828
How many lesbians total do we have to avoid?

1033
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,497
None. We're not avoiding lesbians.

1034
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:21,917
I don't avoid lesbians at all. I seek lesbians out.

1035
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:23,627
Lesbians got the nicest titties.

1036
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,379
Straight women, they have guys

1037
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:27,714
pulling and yanking on them and sweating on them.

1038
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:30,217
Lesbians get touched delicately by other lesbians.

1039
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:31,593
It's nice.

1040
00:50:31,678 --> 00:50:33,220
Did anybody take in what I just said?

1041
00:50:33,304 --> 00:50:35,138
Well, it seems like there's a gauntlet of lesbians.

1042
00:50:35,223 --> 00:50:36,556
No. The...

1043
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,308
All right, I'm just gonna keep going.

1044
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:46,983
1:27, NYPD makes third pass in front of the building.

1045
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:48,318
The parking enforcement officer

1046
00:50:48,403 --> 00:50:50,112
only works the west side of the street.

1047
00:50:50,196 --> 00:50:51,780
She got a fat ass, too.

1048
00:50:51,864 --> 00:50:53,198
All right, baby, I'll call you after lunch.

1049
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:54,533
I'm in a restaurant with Josh

1050
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:56,910
and a couple of other guys across from The Tower.

1051
00:50:57,245 --> 00:50:58,912
Yeah. I love you.

1052
00:51:01,457 --> 00:51:04,042
What are you doing? It's supposed to be a secret.

1053
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,045
I can't tell my wife I'm having a lunch?

1054
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,756
We're not having lunch. We're casing
the front of the building.

1055
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:11,341
Now they can trace our steps back to us.

1056
00:51:11,426 --> 00:51:12,968
I didn't tell her what restaurant we were at.

1057
00:51:13,052 --> 00:51:14,720
You said, "The restaurant across from The Tower."

1058
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:16,763
I didn't say which restaurant across from The Tower.

1059
00:51:16,848 --> 00:51:19,933
Geez, a hamburger's $24. We can't
afford to eat here anyway.

1060
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:22,561
Hey, we can order whatever we like, because

1061
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:24,730
Lunch is on me.

1062
00:51:29,902 --> 00:51:30,944
This is the main electrical room.

1063
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:33,405
You can override the elevators from
here or shut them down completely.

1064
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:35,949
Mr. Dev'Reaux, who took some courses
at DeVry Technical Institute,

1065
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:37,284
is gonna be our point man on this.

1066
00:51:37,368 --> 00:51:39,077
Online. What?

1067
00:51:39,495 --> 00:51:42,080
I went there to go get my master's in electronics,

1068
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,916
but somebody said, "You got to go to college first."

1069
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,210
I was, like, "Yeah, it wasn't in the brochure."

1070
00:51:49,046 --> 00:51:50,756
Okay, but you understand what...

1071
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,843
Absolutely. I weld stuff and I'm,
like, you flip it on and off.

1072
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:56,178
It's all about power.

1073
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,933
Hey, man, how is this supposed to be
right if you made it out of Legos?

1074
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,852
Well, the dimensions are completely accurate.

1075
00:52:04,312 --> 00:52:06,229
Yeah, who's this little nigglet? Webster?

1076
00:52:06,314 --> 00:52:08,648
Man, you might as well use Lincoln Logs or Tinkertoys.

1077
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:09,941
I got your ski caps.

1078
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,193
What?

1079
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:13,862
No, no, no. Ski masks. Masks.

1080
00:52:13,946 --> 00:52:16,031
Yeah, but the guy said that these
were the warmest ever made.

1081
00:52:16,115 --> 00:52:17,449
With pompoms? You serious?

1082
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:20,577
You're such an idiot. I need a mask.
It has to cover your face.

1083
00:52:21,537 --> 00:52:23,330
Josh, let's say we get the money

1084
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:24,831
and make it outside, then what?

1085
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,417
Slide is the only one with no connection to The Tower.

1086
00:52:27,502 --> 00:52:29,294
So he's agreed to hold the money for a week.

1087
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:31,421
Are you crazy? You're gonna give this guy $20 million?

1088
00:52:31,506 --> 00:52:32,464
He's a crook!

1089
00:52:32,548 --> 00:52:34,966
What you say? Say it again. I didn't hear shit.

1090
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,593
Speak into the microphone! - Hey! Hey!

1091
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:37,844
Why don't you say it again, punk?

1092
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:39,429
Come on, Slide, no guns.

1093
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,264
You running things now, huh?

1094
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:42,766
Man in the suit got it all figured out?

1095
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:44,518
No, man in the suit doesn't have it all figured out,

1096
00:52:44,602 --> 00:52:45,977
but man with the gun needs to understand

1097
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,938
what man in the suit is trying
to accomplish here, all right?

1098
00:52:48,022 --> 00:52:49,022
Why you talking like that?

1099
00:52:49,106 --> 00:52:51,233
You were talking like that! Why can't I talk like that?

1100
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:53,360
What you think, this is a joke, Josh?
We gonna just walk in there

1101
00:52:53,444 --> 00:52:55,278
and roll this dude for $20 million without a fight?

1102
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:58,156
Look, no guns. End of story, all right?

1103
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,908
What if we run into some shit in there we don't expect?

1104
00:52:59,992 --> 00:53:01,493
Trust me, there won't be any surprises.

1105
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:10,377
It's the FBI lady and two cops.

1106
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:12,379
Shit! We haven't done anything yet.

1107
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:14,673
We're plotters. We've plotted. That's a crime, right?

1108
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:15,799
Is that a crime?

1109
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:16,883
Everybody, just relax.

1110
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:18,343
You relax! I'm out on bail.

1111
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,178
I'm gonna go in the closet. I'm coming with you.

1112
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,972
Guys, it's okay, I think she's here for me.

1113
00:53:22,056 --> 00:53:23,139
Go find your own spot.

1114
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:30,397
Hey, Agent Denham, what a surprise.
What's with the police?

1115
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:32,440
Josh, Arthur Shaw is gonna walk.

1116
00:53:33,401 --> 00:53:34,401
What?

1117
00:53:34,485 --> 00:53:36,736
The judge is gonna dismiss the
case next week at his hearing.

1118
00:53:36,821 --> 00:53:38,154
They're acting like he's untouchable.

1119
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,740
That's it? He just gets away with it?

1120
00:53:40,825 --> 00:53:41,825
That's not it.

1121
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:44,035
He's threatening to press charges against you.

1122
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,079
He wants you to answer for the Ferrari.

1123
00:53:46,163 --> 00:53:47,455
So they're here to arrest me?

1124
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,125
He says he'll drop the whole thing if you apologize.

1125
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:51,459
A sincere apology,

1126
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:53,545
that's what Shaw wants.

1127
00:53:53,629 --> 00:53:54,796
And if I don't do it?

1128
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,591
Then these gentlemen will read you your rights.

1129
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:20,071
You know what's considered the greatest
move in the history of chess, Josh?

1130
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,907
A man named Frank James Marshall

1131
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:24,576
was losing to a man named Levitsky in 1912,

1132
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,578
world championship in Helsinki.

1133
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:31,917
And it looked like Marshall had no chance
until he moved 23 queen G-3.

1134
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:34,419
He deliberately sacrificed his queen

1135
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:36,630
and the move was so shocking and surprising

1136
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:38,798
that Levitsky never got over it.

1137
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:41,426
He lost the game two moves later.

1138
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:46,056
And the move became known in the annals
of chess as the "Marshall swindle."

1139
00:54:49,977 --> 00:54:52,479
I'm a very good chess player, but I'm no swindler.

1140
00:54:53,564 --> 00:54:56,983
What you did to my Ferrari was
the move of a small man.

1141
00:54:57,068 --> 00:55:00,987
But now it's my move, and I'm not
sure how I want to play this.

1142
00:55:03,574 --> 00:55:05,033
All I'd like to say, Mr. Shaw,

1143
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:07,285
is someday I'm gonna find a way to make things right.

1144
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:09,120
I don't care what I have to do,

1145
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,497
I will find a way to pay you back

1146
00:55:10,581 --> 00:55:11,915
for everything that has been done.

1147
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:16,086
Good, because I know how difficult it must be for you

1148
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,630
to lose a service job like this at your age.

1149
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:23,134
And one day when all this is ancient
history, I hope you can come back,

1150
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,970
maybe not as a building manager at first,

1151
00:55:25,054 --> 00:55:27,889
but somewhere where you can
start over, earn our trust.

1152
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:29,391
A doorman, for instance.

1153
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,396
Now go home and practice your chess game.

1154
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:37,732
I'll study the "Marshall swindle," sir.

1155
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,944
Anybody can sacrifice their queen, Josh.

1156
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:44,531
The real trick is getting away with it.

1157
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:52,664
Thanks for the ride.

1158
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:54,541
Any time. Oh, God, wait a minute,

1159
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,918
before you go, this is for you.

1160
00:55:58,337 --> 00:55:59,337
It's a present.

1161
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,673
It's the footage of you beating
the shit out of Shaw's car.

1162
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:04,259
I took it from the security camera in his apartment.

1163
00:56:05,511 --> 00:56:07,095
You committed larceny for me?

1164
00:56:07,596 --> 00:56:10,181
Let's just say, I misplaced three minutes of footage.

1165
00:56:11,892 --> 00:56:13,309
Thank you. I'm touched.

1166
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:15,687
You're welcome. Okay.

1167
00:56:24,363 --> 00:56:25,780
Are you working on Saturday night?

1168
00:56:25,865 --> 00:56:27,365
I'm always working.

1169
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,700
Call in sick.

1170
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,620
You're asking an FBI agent to lie?

1171
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,290
I'm asking an FBI agent to dinner.

1172
00:56:38,002 --> 00:56:39,169
I'll see you Saturday night.

1173
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:40,503
Good.

1174
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:48,303
What the hell is that in your hand?

1175
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,764
It's a present.

1176
00:56:50,848 --> 00:56:51,973
She gave you a present?

1177
00:56:52,266 --> 00:56:53,349
I don't know about the other guys,

1178
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:55,560
but I don't want you seeing the federal agent anymore.

1179
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:57,062
I'm not seeing her until Saturday night.

1180
00:56:57,146 --> 00:56:58,521
Oh, my God! He's dating her.

1181
00:56:58,606 --> 00:57:01,441
Relax, my social life and my criminal
life are totally separate.

1182
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:02,776
They're not separate if you're dating

1183
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,819
the FBI agent who busted Arthur Shaw!

1184
00:57:04,904 --> 00:57:06,821
Shouldn't we be avoiding law enforcement?

1185
00:57:06,906 --> 00:57:08,656
I never saw an episode of Matlock

1186
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:10,492
where the criminal banged Matlock!

1187
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:12,786
Well, it don't matter. Is this the safe?

1188
00:57:13,454 --> 00:57:14,412
Yeah.

1189
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,498
Then we have a really serious problem.

1190
00:57:20,669 --> 00:57:21,878
You saying you can't open it?

1191
00:57:21,962 --> 00:57:24,047
No, I'm saying I never worked
on a safe like this before.

1192
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:25,381
I usually break into strongboxes.

1193
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:27,342
You never said it was a real safe made out of steel.

1194
00:57:27,468 --> 00:57:28,927
We're going after $20 million.

1195
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:30,011
What did you think it would be? Wood?

1196
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:31,971
What kind of thief can't open a safe?

1197
00:57:32,056 --> 00:57:33,681
Well, generally I rob balconies.

1198
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:35,600
Balconies? Like a cat burglar?

1199
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:37,477
That way I never get charged
with breaking and entering.

1200
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:39,145
And I never steal nothing over $1,000,

1201
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,189
because in New York that shit is a felony.

1202
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,108
What do you get? Like potted plants?

1203
00:57:43,192 --> 00:57:45,276
No, bitch! I don't be stealing no potted plants!

1204
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,112
I steal mostly satellite dishes.

1205
00:57:47,196 --> 00:57:49,405
I got a friend of mine who be
hooking up illegal DirecTV.

1206
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,324
Hey, can your friend hook me up?

1207
00:57:51,408 --> 00:57:52,951
No! This is a bunch of horseshit.

1208
00:57:53,035 --> 00:57:54,327
Your thief isn't even a thief.

1209
00:57:54,411 --> 00:57:56,496
Hang on a sec. You can figure this out, right?

1210
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,248
No, I can't figure this out.

1211
00:57:58,332 --> 00:58:00,458
I'm serious. You have to find a actual safe-cracker.

1212
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:01,793
Where am I gonna find a safe-cracker?

1213
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:03,920
I don't know. You have to start
thinking outside the box.

1214
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:07,924
Shit, you got to find somebody with
some safe-cracking history. Think!

1215
00:58:09,677 --> 00:58:12,554
So, Odessa, I think we should address
the elephant in the room.

1216
00:58:13,013 --> 00:58:14,973
What the hell you just call me?

1217
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:17,642
No, no. I'm talking about the anger you have for me.

1218
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:19,018
How you blame me for losing the pension,

1219
00:58:19,103 --> 00:58:21,020
which is the last thing I ever wanted to happen.

1220
00:58:22,022 --> 00:58:23,815
I know you're a good man, Mr. K,

1221
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:25,441
even though you ruined my life.

1222
00:58:25,526 --> 00:58:27,193
Which is why I invited you here.

1223
00:58:27,486 --> 00:58:29,028
When I hired you, I made a note that

1224
00:58:29,113 --> 00:58:30,655
you worked for your father in Kingston.

1225
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:31,906
He was a locksmith.

1226
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:33,658
Yes, the best in Jamaica.

1227
00:58:33,742 --> 00:58:34,742
Uh-huh.

1228
00:58:34,827 --> 00:58:36,870
Did he teach you how to open locks

1229
00:58:36,954 --> 00:58:38,580
and doors and things like that?

1230
00:58:38,664 --> 00:58:40,999
There ain't no lock I can't get by, Mr. K.

1231
00:58:41,876 --> 00:58:46,504
I was just wondering, do you think
you could open this thing?

1232
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:50,008
That safe has a six-number wheel
pack with a double-action fence.

1233
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:52,051
Very tricky spindle.

1234
00:58:52,136 --> 00:58:53,970
Probably take me 15 minutes to open.

1235
00:58:54,471 --> 00:58:57,473
Fifteen minutes? Could you show us?

1236
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:00,602
What's in it for me?

1237
00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:05,523
2:42, Lester at his post.

1238
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:11,112
Couple of NYPD officers at the falafel cart.

1239
00:59:14,325 --> 00:59:15,825
Wait a second.

1240
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:17,785
That's Charlie.

1241
00:59:19,997 --> 00:59:21,456
What's Charlie doing here?

1242
00:59:21,874 --> 00:59:24,751
Yeah, why is Charlie going into The Tower?

1243
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,593
What did you do?

1244
00:59:33,886 --> 00:59:37,889
I went to talk to Mr. Simon. He called
me, said he had a job for me.

1245
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:40,808
He wants me to be the building manager.

1246
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,144
He asked you to be the building manager?

1247
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:46,231
Yeah, he offered me your job, so I took it.

1248
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:48,775
That's ridiculous! You're not qualified.

1249
00:59:48,859 --> 00:59:52,278
But it's not ridiculous for you to rob $20 million?

1250
00:59:52,363 --> 00:59:54,405
I can't believe how irresponsible you're being!

1251
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,532
You really think that you're gonna just stroll in there

1252
00:59:56,617 --> 00:59:58,576
like Robin Hood and his band of merry doormen

1253
00:59:58,661 --> 00:60:00,787
and outsmart the guys with ear pieces and guns?

1254
00:60:00,871 --> 00:60:02,872
Why is that so hard for you to believe, huh?

1255
00:60:02,957 --> 00:60:04,874
Why can't you just be my skinny Friar Tuck?

1256
00:60:05,167 --> 00:60:06,793
Come on! Who's Friar Tuck?

1257
00:60:06,877 --> 00:60:09,128
Friar Tuck is the guy who helps Robin Hood!

1258
00:60:09,797 --> 00:60:11,297
I can't do this, Josh.

1259
00:60:11,382 --> 00:60:14,634
You put one foot inside The Tower,
I'm gonna call in a Code Blue.

1260
00:60:14,718 --> 00:60:16,219
It's black. It's Code Black!

1261
00:60:16,345 --> 00:60:17,929
You call it black, I call it blue.

1262
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:21,683
Maybe I made up new codes, because
I'm in charge of The Tower now.

1263
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:25,228
I'm warning you, Josh, come
near, it's a Code Blue-Black.

1264
01:00:30,651 --> 01:00:33,528
First thing you do, you have to find the entry point.

1265
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:36,990
You have to use your fingers when
you find the entry point.

1266
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:40,868
It's all in the touch.

1267
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:43,579
You married?

1268
01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:46,499
Say what? You married?

1269
01:00:48,585 --> 01:00:50,378
No, I ain't married.

1270
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,714
What's up?

1271
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,133
Just taking a poll.

1272
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:56,342
Taking a poll?

1273
01:00:56,427 --> 01:00:58,219
I'll take your poll.

1274
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:04,309
Why did you call me here?

1275
01:01:04,393 --> 01:01:05,810
I got a call two hours ago

1276
01:01:05,894 --> 01:01:07,520
from Judge Hollingsworth's clerk.

1277
01:01:07,604 --> 01:01:09,981
They're moving Arthur's court date up to Thanksgiving.

1278
01:01:10,065 --> 01:01:11,065
Thanksgiving?

1279
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,234
The judge wants to avoid a media circus on this,

1280
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,320
let him walk as quietly as possible.

1281
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:17,280
It's an act of contrition.

1282
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:18,948
By the way, Agent Denham,

1283
01:01:19,033 --> 01:01:22,243
I'll be pressing charges against
Josh and all his accomplices

1284
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:24,037
the moment I step out of court.

1285
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:27,332
Come on, he did what you asked, he apologized.

1286
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,710
It's time everyone paid for their mistakes.

1287
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:32,795
I agree.

1288
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:39,302
Hello.

1289
01:01:39,386 --> 01:01:40,970
There's something that you need to know.

1290
01:01:41,055 --> 01:01:45,391
They moved Shaw's court date up to
Thursday, and he's coming for you.

1291
01:01:45,476 --> 01:01:46,893
You'll be in jail by the weekend.

1292
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:49,228
That really messes up our plans, doesn't it?

1293
01:01:51,106 --> 01:01:53,816
Josh, you need to get yourself a lawyer.

1294
01:01:54,485 --> 01:01:55,818
Take care.

1295
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:01,449
Great news, it worked.

1296
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:04,118
We're good for Thanksgiving.

1297
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,547
My sister will be taking the Q train

1298
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,007
to my uncle's house in Brighton.

1299
01:02:18,092 --> 01:02:19,425
She cooks for him every year.

1300
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,052
How am I gonna know what she looks like?

1301
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:22,470
Here.

1302
01:02:22,554 --> 01:02:23,971
Got it. Okay.

1303
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,232
"I know some of you believe I'm the reason

1304
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,693
Paul McCartney didn't buy an apartment here in 2008."

1305
01:02:37,778 --> 01:02:39,070
"Maybe I did get a little confused

1306
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,322
about the meaning of the word 'wanker.'"

1307
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,325
"Maybe you heard about the Mrs. Jin incident.

1308
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,620
I know that I'm not Josh Kovaks."

1309
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,415
"But today I am your leader.

1310
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:35,376
And today is Thanksgiving, the toughest"
day of the year for The Tower.

1311
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,712
"Forty-three parties, close to 500 guests, 30 caterers,

1312
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,215
all of Garage 2 blocked until 4:00."

1313
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:02,260
"Today, you might say, is our Super Bowl.

1314
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:48,055
Today, you might say, we will not lose."""

1315
01:03:09,143 --> 01:03:10,143
Booyah.

1316
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,832
The start of Macy's Thanksgiving Day
parade is just moments away.

1317
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:35,334
Three million people will line the streets of this city.

1318
01:03:35,419 --> 01:03:37,336
Fifty million more will watch from homes

1319
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:39,839
all across the country and around the globe.

1320
01:03:39,923 --> 01:03:42,800
When the parade begins, all eyes turn to the sky

1321
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:46,137
as the largest balloons in the
world soar above this city.

1322
01:03:46,221 --> 01:03:49,223
It's a sight that brings out the child in all of us.

1323
01:04:09,786 --> 01:04:11,954
Hey, Josh, here's your sister's phone.

1324
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:12,997
Great.

1325
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:14,457
She's really hot, by the way.

1326
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,930
Watch your head, Mr. Shaw.

1327
01:04:31,266 --> 01:04:32,308
Where's Slide?

1328
01:04:32,392 --> 01:04:33,684
He's supposed to be here.

1329
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:43,027
They're on the move.

1330
01:04:44,738 --> 01:04:46,113
Wait a sec.

1331
01:04:48,116 --> 01:04:49,659
Oh, God. - What?

1332
01:04:49,826 --> 01:04:51,410
What is it? It's Slide.

1333
01:04:51,495 --> 01:04:52,620
Is he coming up here?

1334
01:04:52,704 --> 01:04:54,539
Shit! - What is he doing?

1335
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:55,623
He's wearing my suit.

1336
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:57,458
He stole my suit.

1337
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,086
He's heading for The Tower.

1338
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,587
Well, that's not the plan.

1339
01:05:01,672 --> 01:05:03,798
How do you forget a plan? Didn't he write it down?

1340
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:04,882
He didn't forget it.

1341
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,384
All that time he spent with Odessa,

1342
01:05:06,468 --> 01:05:07,802
he thinks he can open the safe.

1343
01:05:07,886 --> 01:05:08,970
I don't understand.

1344
01:05:09,137 --> 01:05:10,388
He's going for the money.

1345
01:05:10,472 --> 01:05:11,973
Didn't I tell you he would screw us?

1346
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:13,808
What are we gonna do?

1347
01:05:14,434 --> 01:05:16,227
We stick to the plan.

1348
01:05:16,603 --> 01:05:18,145
We go on Snoopy.

1349
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:24,735
Holy shit! You guys are not gonna believe this.

1350
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:27,029
That girl that moved into 4811?

1351
01:05:27,114 --> 01:05:28,906
She's in French Playboy this month.

1352
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:32,326
And in French Playboy, they're even more naked.

1353
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:35,663
Mrs. Goshen is looking for a Turkish loose tea,

1354
01:05:35,747 --> 01:05:37,999
an orange pekoe or mint melody.

1355
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,751
Well, just send her an assortment, Rose.

1356
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:43,588
I'm at Lenox Hospital, my water broke.

1357
01:05:45,716 --> 01:05:47,300
It's happening. Rose, cover for me.

1358
01:05:47,384 --> 01:05:48,926
I'm having a baby. I'm having a baby!

1359
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,094
Excuse me. I'm having a baby.

1360
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:22,001
Guys, check it out. Snoopy.

1361
01:06:22,085 --> 01:06:23,961
I like Snoopy.

1362
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:25,713
Yeah, it's Snoopy.

1363
01:06:26,173 --> 01:06:28,007
- Snoopy! - Snoopy!

1364
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:44,190
It's Huang's birthday! Everybody come and sing.

1365
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:46,734
Ron, Manuel, come and sing.

1366
01:06:47,235 --> 01:06:49,362
Come on, everybody. Everybody
come on, come on now.

1367
01:06:49,446 --> 01:06:50,863
Everybody come on now.

1368
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,663
So what happened to Mr. Larkin?

1369
01:06:58,747 --> 01:07:00,164
We had to fire Mr. Larkin.

1370
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:02,041
He was involved with some illicit sexual behavior

1371
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:04,085
that we at Chase Manhattan just will not tolerate.

1372
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:06,295
If you wanna wear a black leather
hood and whip your own ass,

1373
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:08,339
work at Bank of America.

1374
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:12,134
So you'll be taking over his account, Mr. Davis?

1375
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:14,136
Yes, I will. Working holidays?

1376
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:15,846
We've been very patient with you

1377
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:18,849
with regard to the Fitzhugh foreclosure,
but the bank is ready to sell.

1378
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:20,685
And we'd like to personally offer you a finder's fee

1379
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:22,353
if we can move the remodel along.

1380
01:07:22,437 --> 01:07:23,938
A finder's fee? Mmm.

1381
01:07:24,272 --> 01:07:26,357
We just started demolishing the apartment.

1382
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:27,566
The place is gonna look like new.

1383
01:07:27,651 --> 01:07:29,694
It's going to be one of the finest units of the building.

1384
01:07:29,778 --> 01:07:31,195
I'd love to see it. Can I see it?

1385
01:07:31,988 --> 01:07:33,864
Here you go. There you go.

1386
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:51,006
Well, looks like the staff is having a little party.

1387
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:03,102
We were supposed to be in that elevator.

1388
01:08:03,186 --> 01:08:04,437
Come on.

1389
01:08:07,524 --> 01:08:09,692
We have to go up. Let's go.

1390
01:08:09,776 --> 01:08:11,652
All the way to the top?

1391
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:16,866
So, as you'll see, this entire
apartment is being redone.

1392
01:08:18,034 --> 01:08:19,785
All new appliances.

1393
01:08:20,787 --> 01:08:22,413
Floor-to-ceiling windows.

1394
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:23,914
Hardwood floors.

1395
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,583
Oh, hardwood floors. That's nice.

1396
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:27,084
Tell me, are you gonna do the closets over?

1397
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:28,252
Yes, right this way.

1398
01:08:28,336 --> 01:08:29,336
Oh, yes. This way.

1399
01:08:30,213 --> 01:08:32,089
This is the master bedroom closet.

1400
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,758
It'll have new sliding racks.

1401
01:08:33,842 --> 01:08:36,761
And what beautiful doors. Are these
doors made of mahogany?

1402
01:08:37,637 --> 01:08:39,930
Mr. Davis?

1403
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,349
Excuse me, Mr. Davis. I'm locked in the closet.

1404
01:08:44,227 --> 01:08:45,227
Hello?

1405
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,389
Sorry, no cleaning now.

1406
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:24,642
It's okay, I'll come back.

1407
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:25,893
Do you want some cake?

1408
01:09:25,977 --> 01:09:27,645
We're celebrating a birthday downstairs.

1409
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:28,729
No, thank you.

1410
01:09:29,022 --> 01:09:30,773
It's amazing cake, are you sure?

1411
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:32,650
I'm allergic to chocolate.

1412
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:34,610
I break out in hives. I can't touch it.

1413
01:09:43,745 --> 01:09:45,162
Bumbaclot!

1414
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:49,166
You should have tried the cake, man.

1415
01:10:09,062 --> 01:10:11,272
Odessa, did he take the cake?

1416
01:10:11,982 --> 01:10:14,149
He's allergic to chocolate. I had to beat him.

1417
01:10:46,099 --> 01:10:47,391
Oh, shit.

1418
01:10:47,726 --> 01:10:48,726
The maid has gone rogue!

1419
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,811
Put him in the chair.

1420
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:02,656
Very spacious.

1421
01:11:22,427 --> 01:11:24,178
Got it! Come on.

1422
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:55,709
Yeah.

1423
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:00,464
This is incredible. Yeah.

1424
01:12:00,548 --> 01:12:03,717
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Kovaks, you were right.

1425
01:12:04,094 --> 01:12:05,719
Move away from the safe.

1426
01:12:06,596 --> 01:12:08,973
I ain't gonna say it again. Back up!

1427
01:12:09,057 --> 01:12:11,308
Are you serious? What are you doing?

1428
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:12,559
Hey, Josh, I'm a thief.

1429
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:14,645
I keep telling you I'm a thief, but
you don't want to believe it.

1430
01:12:14,729 --> 01:12:16,563
I know exactly what I am. You're
the one that's confused.

1431
01:12:16,648 --> 01:12:19,149
Now back up before I pop a cap in your ass.

1432
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:20,234
No.

1433
01:12:21,152 --> 01:12:22,152
No?

1434
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:23,278
Yeah, no.

1435
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:26,156
Look at my face.

1436
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,449
You see how serious I am.

1437
01:12:27,534 --> 01:12:28,826
I'm pretty serious, too.

1438
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:29,952
Are you ready to die, bitch?

1439
01:12:30,036 --> 01:12:31,203
That's my suit.

1440
01:12:31,287 --> 01:12:34,289
Yeah, I got on your suit and your drawers
and socks, too! So what?

1441
01:12:34,374 --> 01:12:35,416
I want my suit back.

1442
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,794
I will blow your face clean off your face! Now, back up!

1443
01:12:39,045 --> 01:12:41,171
You think I'm gonna let this shit get away?

1444
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,923
You don't have a choice.

1445
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:44,466
I brought my own gun.

1446
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:46,635
Now put your shit down, nice and slow.

1447
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,977
You mess with me, you're a dead man. Now drop it!

1448
01:12:55,061 --> 01:12:56,145
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

1449
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:57,479
I'm putting it down right now.

1450
01:12:57,564 --> 01:12:59,189
Take it easy.

1451
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:05,404
On the ground, you punk-ass bitch!

1452
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:07,698
Bitch, on the ground! We had a plan! Take it easy.

1453
01:13:08,116 --> 01:13:09,867
We had a plan! Fitz, calm down.

1454
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:11,368
Come on now. Shit! Fitz, take it easy.

1455
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:12,703
Be cool with the gun, man. Okay. All right.

1456
01:13:12,787 --> 01:13:13,746
Relax.

1457
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:15,748
I'm relaxed, you relax!

1458
01:13:17,709 --> 01:13:20,586
You sissy... You bitch!

1459
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:35,642
Ladies and gentlemen, America's queen of comedy,

1460
01:13:35,727 --> 01:13:37,311
Joan Rivers.

1461
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:39,980
And here's Kanye West.

1462
01:13:41,524 --> 01:13:42,816
Charlie, what are you doing back?

1463
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:44,985
Rose, please. I feel like my head's gonna fall off.

1464
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:47,738
I raced over to the hospital, she's
not there. I can't find her.

1465
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:49,114
I get into an argument with 15 doctors.

1466
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,075
I said, "Where's my wife?" They
said, "Your wife's not here."

1467
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:52,242
I called my Uncle Marty in Brighton.

1468
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:53,368
I say, "You got to get over here.

1469
01:13:53,453 --> 01:13:54,661
She's not here. Nobody can find her.

1470
01:13:54,746 --> 01:13:55,788
He said, "What do you mean no one can find her?

1471
01:13:55,872 --> 01:13:57,414
She's in the television room, watching television.

1472
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,041
I said, "Are you kidding me? Put her on the telephone."

1473
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:00,084
He puts her on the telephone.

1474
01:14:00,168 --> 01:14:01,877
I said, "What are you doing? Your water didn't break?"

1475
01:14:01,961 --> 01:14:03,462
No. "Your vagina's not dilated?" "No."

1476
01:14:03,546 --> 01:14:04,630
I said, "Why did you send me a text message?"

1477
01:14:04,714 --> 01:14:08,884
She says, "I didn't send you a text
message. I can't find my phone!"

1478
01:14:10,136 --> 01:14:11,386
Have you seen Josh?

1479
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:16,058
Manuel, will you show me the penthouse hallway?

1480
01:14:18,686 --> 01:14:21,021
These FBI guys are always falling asleep.

1481
01:14:21,856 --> 01:14:23,649
Where is Mr. Simon?

1482
01:14:23,733 --> 01:14:27,277
He was showing Mr. Fitzhugh's
old apartment to some guy.

1483
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:32,241
Manuel, do you think something strange is going on?

1484
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:35,786
They cut Miss Piggy from the parade.

1485
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,704
I think that's strange.

1486
01:14:45,839 --> 01:14:48,882
Well, it's been nice meeting you, Agent Denham.

1487
01:14:49,259 --> 01:14:52,928
You know, I'm still trying to decide
if I should go after your badge.

1488
01:14:53,012 --> 01:14:55,722
Either way, no hard feelings on my part.

1489
01:14:56,057 --> 01:14:59,685
Maybe we could have dinner sometime, my treat. Huh?

1490
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,989
Can I help you?

1491
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:13,907
We have a meeting with Judge Hollingsworth.

1492
01:15:13,992 --> 01:15:15,409
Judge Hollingsworth is down in D.C.

1493
01:15:15,493 --> 01:15:17,703
He goes down every year to spend
the holiday with his daughter.

1494
01:15:17,787 --> 01:15:18,829
Are you sure?

1495
01:15:18,913 --> 01:15:20,831
There's no one here today, ma'am. It's Thanksgiving.

1496
01:15:20,915 --> 01:15:22,833
What the hell is going on?

1497
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:23,959
Back in the car.

1498
01:15:24,043 --> 01:15:25,502
Wait, no. Wait a second. Back in the car.

1499
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,087
Wait a minute!

1500
01:15:30,341 --> 01:15:33,093
Three, four, five,

1501
01:15:33,344 --> 01:15:35,679
six, seven, eight.

1502
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:40,934
You open it, Mr. K.

1503
01:15:49,903 --> 01:15:50,861
Wow.

1504
01:15:50,945 --> 01:15:52,154
Oh, my God.

1505
01:15:52,947 --> 01:15:54,656
This can't be real.

1506
01:15:58,077 --> 01:16:00,287
Empty! After all this shit, it's empty.

1507
01:16:00,788 --> 01:16:02,164
Man, what kind of...

1508
01:16:02,415 --> 01:16:04,166
Give me my gun back.

1509
01:16:05,043 --> 01:16:06,001
This is over. Give me my gun...

1510
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:08,003
I might need it to get out of here.
I'm not giving it to you.

1511
01:16:08,129 --> 01:16:10,047
Stop bullshitting and give me
the gun. No! I don't want to.

1512
01:16:10,131 --> 01:16:11,673
Give me the goddamn gun! Fitz, give him the gun!

1513
01:16:11,758 --> 01:16:13,800
Give him the gun! Guys. Guys!

1514
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:15,135
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

1515
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,386
You gonna kill somebody in here!

1516
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,555
Sorry. - What the hell, man?

1517
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,314
Give me that crowbar.

1518
01:16:28,566 --> 01:16:30,776
What? Did you find something?

1519
01:16:36,282 --> 01:16:38,242
What is that? Gold.

1520
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:40,327
#NAME?

1521
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:43,205
The hood is solid gold. Do you have
any idea what that's worth?

1522
01:16:44,624 --> 01:16:47,000
It's not just the hood. It's the whole car.

1523
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,211
This is where he hid the money.

1524
01:16:51,297 --> 01:16:53,298
This car must weigh 2,000 pounds.

1525
01:16:53,549 --> 01:16:56,093
Sixteen ounces to a pound, that's 32,000 ounces.

1526
01:16:56,177 --> 01:16:59,471
The current price of gold is $1,872 per ounce.

1527
01:17:00,139 --> 01:17:02,641
Josh, it's about 45 million.

1528
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:04,893
Jesus! $45 million?

1529
01:17:05,603 --> 01:17:06,853
Give or take 10 million.

1530
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:09,273
Give me that crow bar. I am going
to break a chunk off this bitch.

1531
01:17:09,357 --> 01:17:10,607
Are we going to chop it up?

1532
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,359
How we gonna do that?

1533
01:17:13,403 --> 01:17:14,444
Why don't we take the whole thing?

1534
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:15,570
What?

1535
01:17:15,655 --> 01:17:17,864
What are we gonna do? Roll it out the front door?

1536
01:17:17,949 --> 01:17:19,032
It's not gonna fit.

1537
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,076
It is too big. It won't go through the door.

1538
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,119
Man.

1539
01:17:22,203 --> 01:17:24,288
And the doors in Fitzhugh's apartment are torn out.

1540
01:17:24,372 --> 01:17:26,164
Too bad it is six floors down.

1541
01:17:26,499 --> 01:17:27,666
Shit!

1542
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:31,461
How much you say it weighs?

1543
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:00,574
It has to be green, because green means go.

1544
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,248
It's moving.

1545
01:18:15,923 --> 01:18:17,424
This is crazy.

1546
01:18:24,432 --> 01:18:26,933
Josh, this is really crazy.

1547
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:33,065
Okay, all right.

1548
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:34,441
#NAME?

1549
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,112
All right.

1550
01:18:43,534 --> 01:18:45,535
Hey, do you know of any reason

1551
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,871
somebody would want you out
of your penthouse right now?

1552
01:18:48,748 --> 01:18:49,998
No.

1553
01:18:51,584 --> 01:18:54,378
Mr. Shaw, I think you're being robbed.

1554
01:19:02,595 --> 01:19:04,596
This is a bad idea. Really? Which part?

1555
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,680
The part where you screw us over

1556
01:19:05,765 --> 01:19:07,099
and try to take everything for yourself?

1557
01:19:07,183 --> 01:19:08,809
Even when you were six you couldn't share.

1558
01:19:08,893 --> 01:19:10,227
Maybe I just didn't want to share

1559
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:11,561
with your silly seizure-having ass.

1560
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:12,729
All right, you know what? That's it!

1561
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:15,649
I don't want you talking to me
for the rest of the robbery.

1562
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,322
Okay, take it up.

1563
01:19:22,615 --> 01:19:23,824
All right.

1564
01:19:46,973 --> 01:19:48,181
All right, lower it.

1565
01:20:17,628 --> 01:20:20,046
A little more. A little more.

1566
01:20:20,965 --> 01:20:22,382
Okay, stop!

1567
01:20:24,427 --> 01:20:25,469
Grab it, Fitz!

1568
01:20:27,388 --> 01:20:29,347
You have to reach out and pull it in.

1569
01:20:30,475 --> 01:20:33,560
I really don't want to do that. I wanna go home now.

1570
01:20:34,145 --> 01:20:35,896
Home to my old life.

1571
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,607
Do you have any idea how happy I used to be?

1572
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,318
My wife and I flew first class to Greece.

1573
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:43,904
We swam naked.

1574
01:20:44,822 --> 01:20:47,407
We ate lamb.

1575
01:20:47,575 --> 01:20:49,326
Stop acting like a bitch and pull that shit in!

1576
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:51,077
He's freaking out. We have to get down there.

1577
01:20:53,372 --> 01:20:54,372
Shit.

1578
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:58,001
What are you doing?

1579
01:20:58,085 --> 01:20:59,794
That's it, we popped.

1580
01:20:59,879 --> 01:21:00,921
We are not popped.

1581
01:21:01,005 --> 01:21:02,005
What are you doing?

1582
01:21:02,089 --> 01:21:03,673
I'm gonna shoot this guy in the foot when he comes in

1583
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:04,841
and you are gonna slam the door in his face.

1584
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:05,967
No, that's a bad idea.

1585
01:21:06,052 --> 01:21:07,844
You shoot the FBI agent in his
foot, he is gonna come in here

1586
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:10,180
and he is gonna shoot a nigger in his ass. It's over.

1587
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:11,306
All right, great. You give up then.

1588
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:12,390
I'm out of here. Hey!

1589
01:21:12,475 --> 01:21:14,768
I can do it. I'm no bitch.

1590
01:21:15,269 --> 01:21:16,394
Yeah.

1591
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:23,109
Okay...

1592
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:25,904
I can do it.

1593
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:28,698
It's kind of like sailing.

1594
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:40,293
Keep moving!

1595
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:41,711
Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!

1596
01:21:42,505 --> 01:21:44,130
I'm not going out there.

1597
01:21:56,936 --> 01:22:01,439
I got it!

1598
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:04,568
Oh, no.

1599
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:12,909
Yo, we got a dangler!

1600
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:14,661
Help me!

1601
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:16,830
Fitzhugh is dangling!

1602
01:22:17,164 --> 01:22:18,582
- Shit! - Fitz!

1603
01:22:22,503 --> 01:22:23,670
Help!

1604
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:25,714
I'm gonna fall!

1605
01:22:25,798 --> 01:22:28,133
Josh, help me!

1606
01:22:30,386 --> 01:22:31,761
I don't want to die.

1607
01:22:33,889 --> 01:22:34,889
There's a rope.

1608
01:22:35,516 --> 01:22:36,683
Grab the rope!

1609
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,061
I can't!

1610
01:22:40,146 --> 01:22:41,730
Listen to me. No!

1611
01:22:41,814 --> 01:22:44,399
Take your hand off the car and grab the rope!

1612
01:22:45,318 --> 01:22:47,193
It's your only chance!

1613
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:56,286
Yeah! Reach out!

1614
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:03,126
It's too far!

1615
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:04,711
No, it's not!

1616
01:23:14,555 --> 01:23:16,389
I got you. I got you.

1617
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:22,896
I got you. Come on.

1618
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:25,482
What are you doing, man?

1619
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:27,442
We're stealing the car.

1620
01:23:31,113 --> 01:23:32,530
FBI, you got to let us through.

1621
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:35,241
Can't. The parade is coming right
at us for another half hour.

1622
01:23:35,326 --> 01:23:37,744
You're gonna have to go around
the entire park. I'm sorry.

1623
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:45,919
Holy shit! Whoa!

1624
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:48,296
Josh.

1625
01:23:48,381 --> 01:23:51,299
Fitzhugh! What's happening? Are you okay?

1626
01:23:51,801 --> 01:23:54,177
Come in. Fitzhugh!

1627
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:55,261
Dev'Reaux.

1628
01:23:55,554 --> 01:23:56,596
Charlie?

1629
01:23:57,848 --> 01:23:59,683
Where are you? The roof!

1630
01:23:59,767 --> 01:24:01,351
We need to swing the car over to the window.

1631
01:24:07,149 --> 01:24:09,901
Dev'Reaux, I'm gonna try and reel the car in,

1632
01:24:10,486 --> 01:24:12,028
but I'm gonna need your help.

1633
01:24:15,241 --> 01:24:16,783
I'm starting to get kind of queasy.

1634
01:24:17,535 --> 01:24:19,119
Fitzhugh, get the rope. We're gonna hook it.

1635
01:24:22,915 --> 01:24:24,290
I'm gonna call Ralph. What?

1636
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:26,501
I'm getting ready to call Ralph. Who's Ralph?

1637
01:24:39,598 --> 01:24:40,640
Pull!

1638
01:24:48,858 --> 01:24:49,899
Hi, guys.

1639
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,401
God damn it, Josh.

1640
01:24:51,485 --> 01:24:53,653
You realize what you have done
to me? You have ruined my life.

1641
01:24:53,863 --> 01:24:55,572
Do you understand that I'm a part of this now?

1642
01:24:55,656 --> 01:24:57,365
And for what? So you could steal a car?

1643
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,451
Yeah, worth 45 million, made out of gold.

1644
01:24:59,702 --> 01:25:01,161
Gold?

1645
01:25:01,245 --> 01:25:02,662
It's worth 45 million?

1646
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,247
Give or take 10 million.

1647
01:25:05,082 --> 01:25:07,041
All right, come on. Let's push it into the elevator.

1648
01:25:07,334 --> 01:25:08,710
I don't think it's gonna fit.

1649
01:25:08,794 --> 01:25:11,004
No, it won't fit in the elevator.

1650
01:25:11,881 --> 01:25:13,506
But it doesn't have to.

1651
01:25:26,896 --> 01:25:29,981
I'm stopping the elevator right under you guys.

1652
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:35,445
Okay. So what do we do when we get it downstairs?

1653
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:37,197
We'll think of something. Check the glove box.

1654
01:25:37,531 --> 01:25:39,032
Keys have to be here somewhere.

1655
01:25:41,786 --> 01:25:45,038
I don't see any keys. Nothing.

1656
01:25:56,467 --> 01:25:57,592
Holy shit!

1657
01:25:57,968 --> 01:25:59,052
Josh.

1658
01:25:59,553 --> 01:26:02,055
Can you take Lucy on a walk for me?

1659
01:26:02,765 --> 01:26:07,018
My feet are swollen, and there's a goddamn parade.

1660
01:26:08,437 --> 01:26:10,063
You know, now is not a great time, Mrs. Cronan.

1661
01:26:10,272 --> 01:26:11,397
Charlie,

1662
01:26:11,482 --> 01:26:15,401
give her one of those liver treats
that you keep on your desk.

1663
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,487
Yes, ma'am.

1664
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:19,072
Thank you.

1665
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:34,170
Agent Claire Denham requesting backup

1666
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:36,172
at The Tower on Central Park West.

1667
01:26:53,357 --> 01:26:54,566
Okay.

1668
01:27:19,174 --> 01:27:22,135
All right. On three. One, two, three.

1669
01:27:22,928 --> 01:27:23,887
Come on.

1670
01:27:23,971 --> 01:27:25,555
Easy, easy, easy!

1671
01:27:27,224 --> 01:27:28,349
Okay, it's stable.

1672
01:27:28,434 --> 01:27:30,143
That wasn't so bad.

1673
01:27:34,815 --> 01:27:35,815
Whoa!

1674
01:27:38,485 --> 01:27:39,819
What's happening? Why are we moving?

1675
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:42,113
It's security! They're overriding me!

1676
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:57,962
It's the lobby.

1677
01:27:59,506 --> 01:28:00,548
Shh!

1678
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:27,951
Fitz. Take her! Take Lucy! Here.

1679
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:29,118
What? What?

1680
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:31,037
Okay. I got her.

1681
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:44,550
No, no. No!

1682
01:28:44,677 --> 01:28:46,219
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1683
01:29:00,067 --> 01:29:01,651
I think they're gone.

1684
01:29:01,735 --> 01:29:03,069
We need to get out of here right now.

1685
01:29:04,029 --> 01:29:05,196
Slide. Yeah.

1686
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,198
We got to use the truck. Where are the keys?

1687
01:29:07,324 --> 01:29:08,658
Under the sun visor.

1688
01:29:09,076 --> 01:29:10,743
You leave the keys? In New York?

1689
01:29:10,911 --> 01:29:12,161
It's a stolen car.

1690
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:15,081
You brought a stolen car to a robbery?

1691
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,459
Lester, you still there?

1692
01:29:18,711 --> 01:29:21,129
Yeah, I'm here. I'm holding
four cabs at the north door.

1693
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:22,296
Slight change of plan.

1694
01:29:22,381 --> 01:29:25,425
There's a white truck parked on 60th
and Broadway, keys on the visor.

1695
01:29:25,676 --> 01:29:26,676
You got to back it up to the elevator.

1696
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:27,760
I'm on my way.

1697
01:29:45,863 --> 01:29:49,240
Mr. Shaw, tell me about this safe.

1698
01:29:49,366 --> 01:29:50,491
It's empty.

1699
01:29:50,576 --> 01:29:52,994
Doesn't matter if it's empty or full.

1700
01:29:53,078 --> 01:29:54,537
A hidden safe was never mentioned

1701
01:29:54,621 --> 01:29:56,456
in the inventory of your apartment.

1702
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:57,915
You neglected to inform us,

1703
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,043
which is a violation of your parole, therefore...

1704
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:02,045
Where is my car? Where is my goddamn car?

1705
01:30:02,129 --> 01:30:06,299
I hereby remand you to federal custody
until your real court date.

1706
01:30:06,383 --> 01:30:08,217
You just forfeited $10 million.

1707
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:10,261
You think I care about $10 million?

1708
01:30:10,345 --> 01:30:12,555
You think I care if I spend a few nights in jail?

1709
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,474
We both know I'm going to be out by the weekend.

1710
01:30:14,558 --> 01:30:16,601
But you let that car leave this building

1711
01:30:16,685 --> 01:30:18,978
and I promise you won't get off so easy.

1712
01:30:19,646 --> 01:30:21,522
Take him away. Lock it down.

1713
01:30:22,357 --> 01:30:24,484
This is Agent Huggins. Lock down the building.

1714
01:30:34,536 --> 01:30:36,204
Show me the garage.

1715
01:30:36,288 --> 01:30:38,122
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

1716
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:43,211
They got the car. Come on! Come on!

1717
01:30:59,269 --> 01:31:00,937
There they are!

1718
01:31:01,021 --> 01:31:02,438
Here we go, baby.

1719
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:09,779
Move out of the way.

1720
01:31:11,782 --> 01:31:12,990
Go. Go.

1721
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:22,875
Get out of the way!

1722
01:31:28,423 --> 01:31:30,842
Careful. Careful. Jesus Christ!

1723
01:31:37,307 --> 01:31:39,350
Freeze! Do not move!

1724
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:42,812
Open it.

1725
01:31:49,736 --> 01:31:52,238
Son of a bitch! It's a diversion.

1726
01:31:57,703 --> 01:32:00,121
Lester, they are gonna get hurt.
There is no way out of this.

1727
01:32:00,789 --> 01:32:02,373
I don't know what you are talking about.

1728
01:32:02,457 --> 01:32:05,668
All I did is steal a truck and try to commit suicide.

1729
01:32:18,265 --> 01:32:20,641
Mr. Fitzhugh? FBI. You're under arrest, sir.

1730
01:32:20,767 --> 01:32:21,767
Oh.

1731
01:32:21,852 --> 01:32:24,562
Please put your hands behind your back.

1732
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:28,733
Miss Montero, FBI, you're under arrest.

1733
01:32:30,527 --> 01:32:33,196
Charlie Gibbs, FBI, you're under arrest.

1734
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,614
You have the right to remain silent.

1735
01:32:34,698 --> 01:32:36,157
Anything you say, can and will be

1736
01:32:36,241 --> 01:32:37,992
used against you in a court of law.

1737
01:32:38,076 --> 01:32:39,493
You have the right to an attorney.

1738
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:45,625
Mr. Dev'Reaux, FBI. Show me your
hands. You're under arrest.

1739
01:32:56,386 --> 01:32:58,387
Show me your hands, Josh.

1740
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,100
It was smart.

1741
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:07,438
Thanksgiving, the parade, changing the court date,

1742
01:33:08,106 --> 01:33:11,067
using Lester as a diversion, lying to me.

1743
01:33:12,361 --> 01:33:15,112
We have reservations Saturday night
at six different restaurants.

1744
01:33:15,197 --> 01:33:18,115
I'll give you the names if you wanna check.

1745
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:20,952
That's okay, I trust you.

1746
01:33:46,895 --> 01:33:48,104
Where is my car?

1747
01:33:50,649 --> 01:33:52,441
Do you mean the car made of gold?

1748
01:33:52,526 --> 01:33:55,361
Gold melted down from the money you stole?

1749
01:33:55,445 --> 01:33:56,529
I haven't seen it.

1750
01:33:56,989 --> 01:33:58,572
They'll find it.

1751
01:33:58,991 --> 01:34:02,118
And when they do, my friends on the
bench will take no pity on you.

1752
01:34:02,411 --> 01:34:04,704
They'll make sure you go away for a very long time.

1753
01:34:05,372 --> 01:34:07,081
See, you people are working stiffs,

1754
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:08,791
clock punchers.

1755
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:10,626
Easily replaced and erased.

1756
01:34:11,253 --> 01:34:13,296
And just know that while you are all sitting in jail,

1757
01:34:13,672 --> 01:34:15,131
I'll be right up there in the penthouse

1758
01:34:15,215 --> 01:34:17,341
of The Tower, doing what I do best.

1759
01:34:18,051 --> 01:34:19,760
We may be going to jail for a few years,

1760
01:34:19,845 --> 01:34:23,222
but you, you're going for the rest of your life.

1761
01:34:23,807 --> 01:34:24,890
How'd you figure that?

1762
01:34:25,225 --> 01:34:26,392
I found your ledger.

1763
01:34:27,102 --> 01:34:28,311
You know, the one that you stuck

1764
01:34:28,395 --> 01:34:30,438
in the owner's manual of your Ferrari.

1765
01:34:30,689 --> 01:34:31,731
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1766
01:34:32,024 --> 01:34:33,774
I'm guessing you don't really care about the car.

1767
01:34:33,859 --> 01:34:35,693
You could care less about 45 million,

1768
01:34:35,777 --> 01:34:38,321
but I bet you want that ledger back.

1769
01:34:38,947 --> 01:34:40,281
Am I right?

1770
01:34:40,365 --> 01:34:41,532
What do you think you're doing?

1771
01:34:44,077 --> 01:34:45,911
Sacrificing my queen.

1772
01:34:50,459 --> 01:34:52,752
Okay, you and I are gonna make a deal, Josh.

1773
01:34:52,836 --> 01:34:56,380
A deal that will make you and
your friends very wealthy.

1774
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:59,759
Do you think that car has value? Multiply it by 10.

1775
01:35:00,385 --> 01:35:01,719
In cash.

1776
01:35:06,266 --> 01:35:08,100
Dev'Reaux, will you please remind Mr. Shaw?

1777
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:13,105
I'm very sorry, Mr. Shaw, but we
don't accept tips at The Tower.

1778
01:35:17,152 --> 01:35:18,486
Checkmate.

1779
01:35:26,411 --> 01:35:27,828
Hello!

1780
01:35:33,502 --> 01:35:36,170
We've got FBI agents and police all over the city.

1781
01:35:36,254 --> 01:35:38,297
We know about your friend Slide from Astoria.

1782
01:35:38,673 --> 01:35:40,007
Your little trick with Lester may have

1783
01:35:40,092 --> 01:35:41,342
gotten the car out of the building,

1784
01:35:41,468 --> 01:35:44,637
but it's just a matter of time before we find it.

1785
01:35:46,473 --> 01:35:47,723
Who is this?

1786
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:48,849
Director Mazin.

1787
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:51,394
I am Mr. Kovaks' attorney, Miss lovenko.

1788
01:35:51,478 --> 01:35:53,729
I will be representing all the defendants in this case.

1789
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:58,401
And you're licensed to practice
in the state of New York?

1790
01:35:58,902 --> 01:36:01,320
I passed the bar three days ago.

1791
01:36:05,867 --> 01:36:08,494
I'd like to request the immediate
release of all the defendants.

1792
01:36:09,871 --> 01:36:11,122
On what grounds?

1793
01:36:15,377 --> 01:36:17,044
These are Mr. Shaw's hand-written notes

1794
01:36:17,129 --> 01:36:19,088
detailing his fraudulent business practices.

1795
01:36:19,172 --> 01:36:21,090
There are names, dates, account numbers.

1796
01:36:21,174 --> 01:36:22,633
My guess is you'll find enough evidence in there

1797
01:36:22,717 --> 01:36:24,009
to put him away for a very long time.

1798
01:36:24,094 --> 01:36:27,012
But this only happens if my clients walk.

1799
01:36:27,973 --> 01:36:29,682
You've been a lawyer for less than a week

1800
01:36:29,766 --> 01:36:32,518
and you're trying to bribe the
United States government?

1801
01:36:33,478 --> 01:36:35,688
Sharks are born swimming, sir.

1802
01:36:42,988 --> 01:36:44,864
I'll let everyone walk but Kovaks.

1803
01:36:45,365 --> 01:36:49,493
As a first-time offender, he'll probably
get two years for the car.

1804
01:36:50,245 --> 01:36:51,620
Best I can do.

1805
01:36:57,461 --> 01:36:59,295
Nobody else will be charged?

1806
01:37:02,215 --> 01:37:04,300
New evidence in the Arthur Shaw trial

1807
01:37:04,384 --> 01:37:07,470
has prompted a new plea from the accused swindler.

1808
01:37:07,554 --> 01:37:09,722
Sources are now confirming that Mr. Shaw

1809
01:37:09,806 --> 01:37:12,141
will enter a guilty plea next week.

1810
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:18,898
Are we gonna do this or what? Mmm-hmm.

1811
01:37:33,246 --> 01:37:34,747
Hallelujah!

1812
01:37:42,672 --> 01:37:45,174
Welcome to the penthouse, Mr. Shaw.

1813
01:37:46,134 --> 01:37:47,718
Look who's coming now.

1814
01:37:49,429 --> 01:37:52,097
Wait until I get a hold of your wrinkled ass.

1815
01:37:52,182 --> 01:37:54,099
He looks good!

1816
01:38:03,985 --> 01:38:05,528
Are you Rose Demato? Yes.

1817
01:38:05,612 --> 01:38:07,071
Sign right here, please.

1818
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:10,366
All right, thanks.

1819
01:38:34,432 --> 01:38:35,975
It's a gold wheel!
