1
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,882
And honestly...

2
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,551
I wake up happy.

3
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,879
I mean, I'm that guy.

4
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,056
I've got enough
of everything I need.

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,383
I'm single,
I like a party,

6
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,059
and I'm old enough
to enjoy it.

7
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,852
Young enough
to enjoy it.

8
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:57,058
I want to do something,
and I do it.

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,983
<i>There seems to
be a little problem.</i>

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,064
Oh. Must be
the magnetic stripe.

11
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,069
And the weird thing is

12
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,570
I know it's all a cliché.

13
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,402
No strings,
no obligations,

14
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,987
but what's
the alternative?

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,745
Get into some life,
wife, kids,

16
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,577
some kind of car
with too many seats?

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,620
That's a world where you
have to do whatever it is

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,165
other people want you
to do to keep it going.

19
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,468
It's prostitution
when you think about it.

20
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,013
But there is a nagging feeling
that I'm missing something.

21
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,090
Sorry, I don't know
what the problem is.

22
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,641
No, it's not
your fault.

23
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,469
That should do it.

24
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,395
And maybe in the end,
I'm worrying for nothing.

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,188
I mean, I'm not
at this stage of my life

26
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,767
where I have to worry
about most of this stuff.

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,147
Maybe I never will.

28
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,857
I must sound pretty selfish.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,362
Or just drunk.

30
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,864
This is no good either.

31
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,570
You're kidding.

32
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,280
Are you serious?

33
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,865
Whoa.
Come on, wait.

34
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,450
<i>You know
I have money.</i>

35
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,126
I just don't have any on me...

36
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,794
or on my credit cards,

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,543
but I get paid all the time,
and a lot.

38
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,420
Maybe next time.

39
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,296
Car fare?

40
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,060
And by the way...

41
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,308
as someone whose life
really is prostitution,

42
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,142
I can tell you that until you're
actually fucking for a living,

43
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,817
you shouldn't be complaining.

44
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,566
Wait a minute.
That's not what I meant.

45
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,568
Thanks for the drink.

46
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,820
Call Beverly if you want
to make it up to me.

47
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,836
Good evening.

48
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,745
Oh, shit.

49
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,936
Hello?

50
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,692
Hey.
Ah, Jesus!

51
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,444
<i>You have the right
to remain silent.</i>

52
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,070
Oh, wait.
Stop.

53
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,367
Ow!

54
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,740
Don't test me!

55
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,162
Stop!

56
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,409
I warn you,
lam a yellow belt.

57
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,745
Stop.

58
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,201
Stop!

59
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,706
Stop! Relax!

60
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,957
It's me!

61
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,915
Jesus!

62
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,094
What is wrong with you?

63
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,170
I heard a noise.

64
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,926
Ah...

65
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,427
Turn right...
I heard a noise.

66
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,928
Everything is cool.

67
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,351
There's nobody there.

68
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,144
I swear.

69
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,769
It's all right.

70
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:36,827
<i>Five-four-three-two-one-zero.</i>

71
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,621
<i>Ignition. Lift-off.</i>

72
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,865
<i>I guess that's really what I've
been trying to write about.</i>

73
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,284
<i>I mean, who are we
trying to fool?</i>

74
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,283
<i>We 're not only animals, we're
the worst animals there are.</i>

75
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,205
<i>Why do we eat meat?</i>

76
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,367
<i>The Greek gods dined
on ambrosia and nectar,</i>

77
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,372
<i>but we need to incorporate
other species into us.</i>

78
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,124
<i>Look at Christianity.</i>

79
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,547
<i>"This is my body.
This is my blood.</i> ”

80
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,547
<i>That's why I'm doing this chapter
about the genocide in Rwanda.</i>

81
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,378
<i>The Tutsis were vegetarians,</i>

82
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,555
<i>and the Hutus were ranchers,
who eat meat,</i>

83
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,634
<i>and they regarded the Tutsis
as monkeys, as animals,</i>

84
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,345
<i>and that's why they had no trouble
killing them. Don't you think?</i>

85
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,055
Honestly, Ben,
I don't know why

86
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,890
the farmer and the cowhand
can't be friends.

87
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,351
But I do know
that part of the reason

88
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,358
why some people regard
other people as animals

89
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,735
is because they don't observe
the social conventions

90
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,737
most of us take
for granted.

91
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,740
Every human function
is disgusting in our society.

92
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,823
I side with the public
on this one.

93
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,034
<i>I know what I am...</i>

94
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,210
<i>and that's an animal.</i>

95
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,583
I'm human,
but animal.

96
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,756
You're wasting a lot of
thought on something

97
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,674
that's not going
to get you high or laid.

98
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,969
I always say, "if it ain't
broke, don't fix it."

99
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,546
Well, you're very wise.

100
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,007
And broke.

101
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,012
That is so uncool.

102
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,593
Can't I just take
some money back?

103
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,269
I get paid very soon,
and when I do,

104
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,188
I'm going to float you
another loan.

105
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,357
Until then, I'd like to
borrow back what I lent you.

106
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
Why do you need to leave?

107
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,898
You just going to go out there
and be part of the machine?

108
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,986
Hey, that machine is what
keeps you in all this.

109
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,914
Now you know there's no one
out there today, right?

110
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,866
Yeah.

111
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,794
So just hold it together
and do whatever it is you do.

112
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,587
I'm writing a book.

113
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,880
What is it that you do?

114
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,516
Fuck it. I'm going to
get the didgeridoo.

115
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,305
Please,
didgeri-don't.

116
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,838
Forgot my ID.

117
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,139
I wish I could say
you look trustworthy.

118
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,696
Buenos dias.

119
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,364
<i>Hey, Steve.</i>

120
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,152

122
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,123
Pretty much the usual.

123
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,870
There's this pocket
of cold air coming in,

124
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,997
but you'll see it
on the composite.

125
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,170
I'm going to talk to Dave about
putting a real window in here

126
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,622
so we can see if any
of this stuff is right.

127
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,709
It's right.
Want one?

128
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,043
They're poison.

129
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,337
But there's two of them.

130
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,926
Got him.

131
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,983
God, you cut it
so close.

132
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,443
Thrilling,
isn't it?

133
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,870

140
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,969
Can I get
some water?

141
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,246

Good afternoon.

154
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,794
Tragedy struck this morning
as a Truxton man

155
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,796
backed his late-model SUV

156

One youngster remains

00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,314
I don't know.

163
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,983
Kind of captures the mood.

164
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,106
She's really solid.

165
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,153
<i>...Identified the driver
under investigation.</i>

166
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,572
And he's really high.

167
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,615
You know, Stu?

168
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,989
You don't just go spreading
rumors about people like that.

169
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,615
The man
is a working professional.

170
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,948
Lots of people
have squinty red eyes,

171
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,998
insatiable thirst,
and trouble walking.

172
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,452
He could be diabetic
or something.

173
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,583
You're right.
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,130
The bearded
and bespectacled doctor

175
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,082
murdered at least
26 patients,

176
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,012
making him one of the world's
most prolific killers.

177
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,088
So Steve, how's it
looking out there today?

178
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,172
It's about time we saw
some of this warmer weather.

179
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,014
Well, Victoria,
let's get things started

180
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,141
with a little shot
of the harbor

181
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,848
and some seagulls
enjoying the sunshine.

182
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,649
How you doing there,
fellas?

183
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,353
Today's high will get up
to about 65 degrees

184
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,484
with unlimited visibility

185
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,941
which means if we could get this
Knucklehead out of the way,

186
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,994
you could see clear down
to Ocean City.

187
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,820
Coldest spot in the nation?

188
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,998
Why, that honor goes to...

189
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,244
Bismarck.

190
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,292
Smooth as silk.

191
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,495
That seem to you
like someone on drugs?

192
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,458
<i>...and at 100% humidity
and 89 degrees</i>

193
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,884
little Hilo, Hawaii
is both the hottest

194
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,711
and wettest spot
in the nation.

195
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,217
I guess that makes it
the number one destination

196
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,425
for teenage boys,
eh, Victoria?

197
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,019
I guess so, Steve.

198
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,850
So I know
I don't have to tell you

199
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,811
that showing up with
enough time for us to know

200
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,238
that you're going to be here,
and in condition to work

201
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,906
is 90 percent of it.

202
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,904
And why the fuck
are you paying attention

203
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,405
to your computer?

204
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,987
Are you ever going
to friend me?

205
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,038
<i>You think
you're irreplaceable?</i>

206
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,036
You have this job because you're
handsome and you can talk.

207
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,162
And people trust me.

208
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,165
No one trusts you.

209
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,121
You think you're going to move
to a bigger market?

210
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,956
Not with that nose.

211
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,258
You know, I could just
as easily demean your job

212
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,085
if I had any idea
what it entailed,

213
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,591
and honestly,
I kind of resent you

214
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,844
making this
so awkward for me.

215
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,766
What are you
talking about?

216
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,843
Well, I need a little money
till the end of the month.

217
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,395
It's the sixth.

218
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,791
Look, I didn't say
give it to me-.

219
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,348
It's just an advance.

220
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,024
You know what
the good thing is?

221
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,701
I know you can't go on
like this forever.

222
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,524
Guys like you
count on that,

223
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,650
but what if you're wrong?

224
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,067
Fire drill?

225
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,117
I really doubt that.

226
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,326
I just want to see my friend.

227
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,247
Step away
from the door, sir.

228
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,044
I'm only going
to ask you once.

229
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,548
You'll break the door.

230
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,850
Fucking local ditwad...

231
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,805
Wait a second.
I know that guy.

232
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,730
- You what?
- I said I know that guy.

233
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,979
- Everybody calm down.
- I <i>have a yellow belt!</i>

234
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,982
Jesus, Ben. Let her go.

235
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,530
Told you I just wanted
to see my friend.

236
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,783
I'll... I'll pay
for the plant.

237
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,284
My dad died.

238
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,217
Don't you...

239
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,424
No, no, no!

240
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,098
And could I get
some Visine please?

241
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,275
Great.

242
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,899
I mean, would you like your
kitty cat to be used as bait?

243
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,029
You have three-and-a-half
pounds of crayfish.

244
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,861
I need three-and-a-half
pounds of crayfish.

245
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,571
What the hell
is going on?

246
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,748
I was telling him
they're too little to eat,

247
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,871
and we have a strict
no return policy.

248
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,419
What difference does it
make what I want them for?

249
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,371
These are the babies
of a species.

250
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,502
We judge a culture on how
it treats its children, right?

251
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,981
They were hatched one day and
raised to be murdered the next.

252
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,886
We're talking about one of the most
sophisticated nervous systems in the world.

253
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,385
It's like us,
the dolphins,

254
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,431
then them.

255
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,427
A hundred bucks.

256
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,848
You know, anyone
who is going fishing today

257
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,184
has probably come and gone.

258
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,769
How about a markdown?

259
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,944
I don't give a shit.

260
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,114
I'm not arguing with the
spirit of Operation Crayfish.

261
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,241
I'm just saying
it was overfunded.

262
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,912
<i>It's really beautiful.</i>

263
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,214
<i>I forgot, you know.
It's been so long.</i>

264
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,792
<i>Yeah, I haven 't been
back since my parents died.</i>

265
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,593
<i>Your parents aren't dead.</i>

266
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,261
<i>Well, you know,
since they moved.</i>

267
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,981
Because we've been circling
our destination for...

268
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,603
three hours now,

269
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,276
and my feeling is
we should get dressed

270
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,819
and rock this funeral.

271
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,115
I think I'm ready.

272
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,047
Goddamn.

273
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,414
Shit!

274
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,839
I still say it's better
than ending up as bait.

275
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,047
They mate for life,
you know.

276
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,346
Not those.

277
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,566
Uh-oh, look.
He blew a foot.

278
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,895
Can you imagine if you had to shoot
your car every time you got a flat?

279
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,730
Those people
understand the land,

280
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:44,985
and they live by it.

281
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,928
I don't feel so good.

282
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,099
<i>Although Sam Baker
was not a religious man,</i>

283
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,903
he found comfort and joy in his
children, Teresa and Benjamin,

284
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,106
and his lovely wife,
Angela.

285
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,282
Now reading
from the Old Testament.

286
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,109
The Song of Solomon.

287
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,911
"Arise my love,
my fair one.

288
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,241
Look at her, the slutty,
wicked stepmother.

289
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,418
<i>She wants it all
to herself.</i>

290
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,961
<i>"...the flowers
appear on the earth."</i>

291
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:46,134
<i>You can practically
see through that dress.</i>

292
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,881
I don't think so.

293
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,213
<i>"...is heard in our land."</i>

294
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,262
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,018
We got
a late start.

296
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,474
It's okay.

297
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,275
It doesn't matter.
You're here.

298
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,944
I just wish
I could see him.

299
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,529
I just wish he could
see that beard.

300
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,997
Your coat
smells weird.

301
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,584
I'm just saying...

302
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,003
I think we sort of have to step
up into the role of adults now

303
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,206
and decide what's going to
happen with the estate.

304
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,251
I have some ideas,

305
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,381
some of which I actually
ran past Dad,

306
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,010
so I know
he wasn't opposed,

307
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,261
about basically dealing
with the store.

308
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,769
How are the ribs?

309
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,721
They're good.

310
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,102
They're small, so they're
either really cheap

311
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,436
or off a really,
really young pig.

312
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,107
Well, steak's...
Steak's pretty good.

313
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,782
I'll tell you
what looks good is...

314
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,404
what do we got here, Ben?

315
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,781
Some deep-fried onions

316
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,407
dipped in Ranch.

317
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,581
Bet it tastes
like springtime.

318
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,408
Boy, that vegetarian lifestyle
takes a lot of discipline.

319
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,629
And the farm.

320
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,460
There's just
that cruddy house,

321
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,126
but we're talking about
almost 150 acres of land.

322
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,587
I don't think we should be
talking about this right now.

323
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,092
Jesus, Steve,
eat your fucking ribs.

324
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,643
Are you sure
nobody wants any wine?

325
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,140
I got the best one
on the laminate.

326
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,972
What are you
even doing here?

327
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,978
I'm his ride.

328
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,277
Look, Ben, I wanted to
discuss this just <i>as</i> family,

329
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,322
without her, and certainly
without your ride.

330
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,076
I don't think that you're suited
to deal with any of this stuff.

331
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,153
And I don't mean that
as an insult.

332
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,741
I just know that you've been
happy with your life as it is.

333
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:08,124
And when you consider what the
property is actually worth...

334
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,046
It's so weird
to be home

335
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,795
and to think
that he's not here,

336
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,047
how we just put him
in a hole in the ground.

337
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,931
You know, Terri, maybe...

338
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,100
maybe now really
isn't the best time.

339
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,975
I'm just saying you can just sit
back and I'll take care of you.

340
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,770
And I'll take care
of this.

341
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,693
To taking care of things.

342
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,536
You can stay a night.

343
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,868
You said that guy with the
mustache will cover for you.

344
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,453
Delia?
Yeah, she'll do.

345
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,880
She's a good
emergency measure, but...

346
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,457
but what am I
doing here?

347
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,837
I mean, don't you
want me to go home

348
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,044
and water the plant at least?

349
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,300
I just want all this
to go away.

350
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,881
Look, man, you're going
to have to face it.

351
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,387
Your sister is still
a total buzzkill.

352
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,059
So you'll stay?
I've got a sleeping bag.

353
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,229
I could be persuaded.

354
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,231
What's that, Obi-wan?

355
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,531
You want me to stay, too.

356
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:25,364
You got
my fucking skates, Ben.

357
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,226
Hey...

358
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,427
I just wanted to say...

359
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,433
sorry for your loss.

360
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,107
Well, that's life,
isn't it?

361
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,231
We're like waves
in the ocean.

362
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,358
We roll in...

363
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,860
we have our existence,
we break on the shore.

364
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,571
Hmm, what a beautiful and
nautical way to think of things.

365
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,792
Now you might want
to shut that window.

366
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,541
We're expecting some showers
coming in from the coast.

367
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,123
I doubt it. Hasn't
rained here in a while.

368
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,834
Well, you're
the weather man.

369
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,091
Look, I don't know if I'm going to
be staying in the house much longer,

370
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,674
so if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to be by myself.

371
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,680
Well, if you're interested
in leaving right now,

372
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,887
I can get you on
the next scheduled flight.

373
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,273
Thanks, but uh...

374
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,397
I try to avoid things
that keep me from feeling.

375
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,339
Shhh!

376
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,701
"Whatever remains of me

Oh, come on.

Yeah. Wow.

393
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,871
Again, what are you doing here?
He's with me.

394
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,367
I'll leave.
You got to bring him.

395
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,165
He's my husband.

396
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,084
Please, can we stop
all this bickering?

397
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,122
A man died here,
a very rich man.

398
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,548
That's okay, Mr. Stevens.

399
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,296
I'll read that part later.

400
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,718
All right.

401
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,091

"but no one owns them."

406
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:48,741
Is that it? No, there's a
bunch more sex stuff here.

407
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,239
Oh, good.

408
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,786
Okay...

409

415
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,299

- What?
- You got to be kidding me.

422
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,650
That would include the

<i>and the rest of his assets</i>

426
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,656
which totals
close to 2.5 million dollars.

427
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,115
Oh, my God.

428
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,324
I need some air.

429
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,162
This is total bullshit.
Jesus, Terri.

430
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,838
Was even competent
when he wrote this?

431
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,167
Your father was quite lucid.

432
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,378
I'm sorry. My suit
was really itchy, I...

433
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,011
So I'm not mentioned
in there at all?

434
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,990
It's a lot
of money.

435
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,658
2.5 million dollars?

436
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,156
It's more
than a lot of money.

437
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,205
No, honey.
I meant the 350 for us.

438
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,453
It is.
Why aren't you happy?

439
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,830
You told me you thought she
was going to get everything.

440
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,833
She's up to something.
Believe me.

441
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,381
Like she boned
a 77-year-old man

442
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,049
for five years
for nothing.

443
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,298
But the will said
this is what she wanted.

444
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,845
Why does she
hate me so much?

445
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,974
<i>It's really amazing.</i>

446
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,848
<i>I mean, it's all here,
pretty much as simple</i>

447
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,554
<i>as filling out some
change of address stuff.</i>

448
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,230
What's the deal?

449
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,585
<i>You overdo it
on the celebrating?</i>

450
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,517
Because I just started.

451
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,695
I don't know.
You don't know what?

452
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,647
This is what we've been
working for your whole life,

453
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,152
to inherit this money.

454
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,999
You know what
we should do?

455
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,747
Order pizza.

456
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,247
Call those assholes up
at Massata's and say,

457
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,045
"Guess what?
You have to deliver

458
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,918
"all the way out
to the Baker farm."

459
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,546
Pay them $1000
if that's what they want.

460
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,252
"Get in that Tercel

461
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,508
"and get that pizza
out here now, fuckers."

462
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,759
And they'll do it.

463
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,556
I'm not hungry.

464
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,851
It hurts my head,
all these facts and figures.

465
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,224
What are you talking about? You're
four credits shy of being an MBA.

466
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,101
I'm not a businessman.
I hate businessmen.

467
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,057
If Jerry Garcia
hadn't lured you away

468
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,017
you would have been
a great businessman.

469
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,141
Who knew there was so much
money in a country store?

470
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,109
I don't want money.

471
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,349
You don't have to put such a
shitty spin on everything.

472
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,576
Maybe this is your
father's way of giving you

473
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,745
a chance to be what you
always wanted to be.

474
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,448
This is my father reaching from
beyond the grave to control me.

475
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,454
The whole thing just insinuates
that I'm crazy,

476
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,410
that there's something wrong
with the way that I live,

477
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,211
but I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

478
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,167
I'm supporting you.
Of course everything's fine.

479
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,254
Look, I'm the last person
that should be saying this,

480
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,926
but what about me?

481
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,972
How's that?

482
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,224
What's the difference? I
don't like hurting you.

483
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,103
Well, I don't like that making a
baby feels like chemotherapy.

484
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,775
Look, honey,
your dad just died.

485
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,478
And I'm shooting you
full of hormones.

486
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,983
If that doesn't make
you crazy...

487
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,779
Are we going to do this?

488
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,575
You still look beautiful.

489
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,998
Thank you.

490
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,835
Sorry!

491
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,879
I'll be out
in a minute.

492
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,502
So you're really leaving?

493
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,459
<i>What are you
going to do now?</i>

494
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,636
Some friends of mine have a farm
in upstate New York.

495
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,510
<i>Maybe I'll go hang out
with them for a while.</i>

496
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,935
Just growing incense
and making your own clothes?

497
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,182
Not that you need any.

498
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,816
No, actually,
I have a degree.

499
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,769
I'll probably go back
to teaching special ed.

500
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,322
You got to look out for
Number One, I guess.

501
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,662
You are so lovely.

502
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,115
What's your point?

503
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,542
It's just I knew
the first Mrs. Baker

504
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,541
and she wasn't even
remotely in your league.

505
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,247
I mean, ever.

506
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,212
Are you stoned?

507
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,884
Sure, I'm the weird one.

508
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,553
You had sex
with a 900-year-old man.

509
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,223
That barrel chest,
those toenails.

510
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,017
It probably sounds
like a big joke,

511
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,812
since that's what love always
sounds like to people like you,

512
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,515
But Sam took pleasure
in everything in his life

513
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,898
that was real,
his food, his farm,

514
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:39,152
his business,
and yes, his wife.

515
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,201
So when you were a little girl and
you imagined being with somebody,

516
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,073
that was it?

517
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,369
I can't believe you.

518
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,658
Sam needed me.

519
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,914
And he deserved me because
he was wonderful to me.

520
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,041
You forget you're talking
about someone I knew

521
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,748
longer than you actually.

522
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,083
He stopped talking
to his son.

523
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,758
Ben stopped talking to him...

524
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,211
and it broke his heart.

525
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,591
Okay, well, maybe you'd better
run along and get high,

526
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,926
so at least one of us
can forget

527
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,885
we had this conversation.

528
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,118
<i>Honey, what are
you doing out there?</i>

529
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,992
Just trying to keep these toys
from killing the lawn.

530
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,037
<i>I'll be up
in a minute.</i>

531
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,959
<i>Is something burning?
I smell smoke.</i>

532
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,310
- Morning.
- Morning.

533
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,265
I could make you
some eggs if you want.

534
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,477
Wait, now, are they the kind
with blood spots in them?

535
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,482
They're eggs from chickens
who walk around.

536
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,188
So they do have
blood spots in them.

537
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,444
Okay, everybody,
are you sitting down?

538
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,526
Sit down, sit down,
sit down, sit.

539
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,611
I had a...
sit!

540
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,287
I had an incredible night.

541
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,365
And I swear to God
it was a visitation,

542
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,291
and Dallas,
I can't thank you enough.

543
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,710
Are you okay?

544
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:57,786
I am beyond okay.

545
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,462
I'm past okay.

546
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,211
I'm not even looking back
at it anymore.

547
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,041
<i>Steve was right.
This is my chance.</i>

548
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,797
Of course I can't do it alone,
but I was thinking

549
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,753
about taking the money
from the grocery store

550
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,838
and creating an institute
where people can come and study

551
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,845
how to regain man's balance
with nature.

552
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,393
Horticulture, agriculture,
aquaculture.

553
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,516
Angela, you know
about all of this shit,

554
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,563
and you can give lessons on
cleaning and all that woman stuff,

555
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,359
<i>and Steve, if we're going
to have a society,</i>

556
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,813
we're going to need
a TV station.

557
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,065
You could have
the whole station.

558
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,191
That sounds great.

559
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,325
You look like
you haven't slept much.

560
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,073
Why don't you sit down and
we'll have some breakfast

561
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,245
and talk
about the plan.

562
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,914
You understand I'm talking about
fundamental changes to society.

563
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,458
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm not hungry.

564
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,933
I have a mission statement
to write.

565
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,542
Is it...
always like that?

566
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,753
He usually doesn't make
that much sense.

567
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,053
I'll be right back.

568
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,097
Hey, genius at work.

569
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,769
I'm modeling it
on Plato's School of Athens

570
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,019
only not the Socratic method.
It's more like Buddha.

571
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,396
You can relax. I can see what's
going on in your face right now.

572
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,523
It's one tenth of what's
going on in my mind.

573
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,571
You told me that my father
had a plan for me,

574
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,273
to do what I wanted,
and this is what I want,

575
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,233
<i>and I'm not
leaving you behind.</i>

576
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,160
The TV station thing was
just off the top of my head.

577
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,737
I want you to know
that I'm grateful,

578
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,538
and the way
that I figure it,

579
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,582
there's enough for me
to keep the grocery store,

580
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,954
and for you
to have the farm

581
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,126
and the house.

582
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,748
And it's not a gift.

583
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,375
You've earned it.

584
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,457
Suddenly the plan seems
more appealing.

585
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,134
But I don't think you're...
you seem a little...

586
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,849
The journey to enlightenment
is stressful.

587
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,472
No, it's
not enlightened.

588
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,972
Great, Mom's home.

589
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,438
Why are you still here?

590
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,939
Why are you so angry?

591
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,489
<i>This was my mother's.</i>

592
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,444
I need you
to mellow out.

593
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,620
I need to keep my wits
about me.

594
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,789
I'm going to get this all down.
Please, you're out of control.

595
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,492
Let's take the edge off.
Great...

596
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,125
This is my wedding all over again.
What are you doing?

597
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,564
This is important shit. This is
a chance to right your life.

598
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,924
Drugs are not the answer.

599
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,251
That's what
I've been saying.

600
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,211
Thank God you're here,
cuz I can't do it all alone.

601
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,171
Jesus, get out and go away.
I need to talk to my brother.

602
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,348
- He doesn't want to talk.
- Yes I do. I have a plan.

603
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,300
- I'm going to start...
- You don't have to tell her your plan.

604
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,352
Steve, I would prefer
to forgo your input

605
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,306
and that most recently resulted
in my brother becoming fat,

606
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,518
unemployed, and growing
that superbly antisocial beard.

607
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,649
- Do not talk to him like that.
- No, it's okay.

608
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,696
You know what, Terri? I am
going to get out of your way,

609
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,866
you can direct that rage
where it really belongs,

610
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,318
at your grieving family.

611
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,163
He doesn't understand
what's going on.

612
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,665
The decisions
that you make now

613
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,371
could secure
a real future.

614
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,331
You don't think
I know that?

615
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,634
I'm sorry. I guess I just
got blindsided yesterday.

616
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,508
It blew me away, too. I didn't want
the headache, but then I thought

617
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,465
all of this is part
of something amazing.

618
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,801
Life stuff,
renewal, rebuilding.

619
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,885
Yes, exactly.

620
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,721
I mean, this chrysalis
has served us

621
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,023
as we developed
from pupae to adult,

622
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,476
and now it has to be shed
and eaten.

623
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,857
What are we
talking about?

624
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,483
I really want to utilize
this capital

625
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,190
to right some major wrongs,

626
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,241
educate some mysteries,
set some ideas free.

627
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,661
Well, why don't I find a way
to manage my finances

628
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,785
so I can support you
in eight months

629
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,958
after you've pissed away what
it took Dad a lifetime to make.

630
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,126
I hear where
you're coming from,

631
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,205
but it's just money. It doesn't
mean Dad loved me more than you.

632
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,087
What? It doesn't mean Dad
loved me more than you.

633
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,383
He didn't...

634
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,756
love you more.

635
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,212
You were the squeaky wheel,

636
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,467
<i>so you got
all the oil.</i>

637
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,596
And if I were you,

638
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,646
I wouldn't rush off to go
change the world quite yet.

639
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,937
Hello...

640
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,864
Anybody?

641
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,282
I'm going to go now.

642
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,128
Ben?

643
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,750
Ben?

644
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,126
<i>Yeah, I'm up here.</i>

645
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,926
Look at you.

646
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,972
Master of all that you survey.
Yeah.

647
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,800
You know, I wouldn't go if I
didn't have this job thing.

648
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,227
I'll be back out next
weekend, I promise.

649
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,555
Plus, you can always call.

650
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,313
Oh, I'll call. I'll call as soon as
I get that big fat check for you.

651
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,361
Hey, you know, I didn't think you
were really going to do that.

652
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,484
Hey, buddy?

653
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,815
I love you.

654
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,618
Take a shower, okay?

655
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,248
Wait, so you're just
going to leave?

656
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,251
Yeah, I got to get going.

657
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,674
It was really great to see
you, and thanks for the pie.

658
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,921
That was for dinner.

659
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,126
I'll be eating dinner.

660
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,837
No, for everyone.

661
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,638
You're not as giving
as I thought you were.

662
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,841
I don't want the pie back.
I just...

663
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,676
Well, I guess you know Ben
better than I do.

664
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,636
Is he going to be
okay here by himself?

665
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,096
By himself?

666
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,147
What, now you're
going to leave?

667
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,975
I mean, with that poor kid up there?
So he's not okay.

668
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,435
He's right <i>as</i> rain.

669
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,690
I mean, his father
just died,

670
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,487
he's got a drug problem,

671
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,736
probably some kind
of manic-depressive disorder,

672
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,319
and honestly, he wasn't that well
screwed together to begin with,

673
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,825
but he's an adult,
and I have to go back

674
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,451
to do the 4:30 weather.

675
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,533
And although
you're under no obligation

676
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,540
would it be so bad to take
another two or three weeks

677
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,963
before you do whatever
bullshit you have to do?

678
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,383
You mean
teaching disabled kids?

679
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,210
Oh, now they're disabled.

680
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,547
Do you have any actual plans?

681
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,811
I guess I could take my
time moving out. Great.

682
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,103
You get a week,

683
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,896
and I'm not adopting him.

684
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,682
Perfect. I'm going
to leave you my number...

685
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,860
in case you
have to get in touch.

686
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,438
Because, you know,
I'm on TV.

687
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:05,908
Yeah, actually Sam
bragged about you once.

688
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,410
I think he liked you, but he
couldn't really express it.

689
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,834
Yeah, it always came out
as "moron-troublemaker."

690
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,878
He hated the Irish, too.

691
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,296
People forget that.

692
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,089
Okay, now will you let me know
if I run over a chicken,

693
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,921
'cause the pie
is all I can eat right now.

694
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,506
How long does he
stay up there?

695
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,932
Let me know.

696
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,075
Hey.
Hey.

697
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,910
How are you
holding up?

698
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,961
I don't know.

699
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,584
It's all temporary, right?

700
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,416
Angela, you knew
when you decided

701
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,752
to get involved with
a man so much older

702
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,586
it wasn't for life.

703
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,048
You are so sentimental.

704
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,552
Okay, all's I'm saying

705
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,384
is that you
had that experience.

706
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,640
Now don't be afraid
to be with a man your age.

707
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,936
You got
a whole time ahead.

708
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,225
Ben asked me
to put these up.

709
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,312
I have some.
They upset people.

710
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,318
Hey, Mom. Sam
Stallsworth is outside.

711
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,990
You're going to have to
negotiate the lettuce with him.

712
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,317
Now listen,
I've got to go.

713
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,653
I might need my hands.

714
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,578
Okay.

715
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,452
Hello, Terri.
Good morning, sunshine.

716
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,171
It's hard, huh...

717
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,499
without him?

718
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,753
Yeah,
try to keep busy.

719
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,345
Uh, about Ben.

720
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,674
Oh, God, don't stick
your nose in that, too.

721
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,009
I'm living
with him, Terri.

722
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,686
Nobody asked you to. In fact, I'm
surprised you didn't blow out of town

723
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,041
on the next guy
who came through.

724
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,519
Oh, Jesus.
That tongue.

725
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,021
I think you just spoiled
all the vegetables in here.

726
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,320
You know, you came
into my family very recently,

727
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,523
and you started telling
everybody what to do,

728
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,948
which was nothing.

729
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,118
Do nothing.
That is not true.

730
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,991
You convinced my father to let a
thriving business go to seed.

731
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,538
"These are the good years.

732
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,035
"Life is for living."

733
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,958
I mean, Christ,
a man his age

734
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,787
throwing himself at yoga
and guitar lessons?

735
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,042
You don't believe
in growing!

736
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,668
You don't grow!

737
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,375
You're a tumbleweed

738
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,460
who blows around
whenever the wind changes.

739
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,547
Shit, I swore
I wouldn't engage.

740
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,006
<i>L</i> got to go-

741
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,716
You know, people hide
in charity.

742
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,687
Once in a while, assume other
people are as good as you.

743
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:37,935
Not worse.

744
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,355
They're not.

745
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,696
<i>How was the vacation?</i>

746
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,319
It wasn't a vacation.

747
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,366
Oh, did you get
your eyes done?

748
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:52,696
<i>Delia got some fan mail, you know.
ls</i> that right?

749
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,372
A hundred bucks
says Delia's fan mail

750
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,415
came from a member
of the cafeteria staff.

751
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,243
<i>Corporate thinks
each piece of mail</i>

752
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,374
<i>represents 1000 viewers.</i>

753
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,421
What, did she do
a really good job?

754
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,171
Hey, what was with you wrestling
that bum the other day?

755
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:09,049
Nicely done. So did you
know him or something?

756
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,128
You know how it is, you buy
someone a cup of coffee

757
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,016
and suddenly they're
your best friend.

758
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,060
Do I need
my eyes done?

759
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,684
30 seconds. It would be illegal
to make them any bluer.

760
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,186
See, that's what
I think.

761
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,391
Spinach check.

762
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,404
<i>You have
no whitening trays.</i>

763
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,322
Now I really can't stay.

764
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,739
God, it must be tough
having to win the viewers over

765
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,792
one at a time
like this.

766
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,211
You know, while you were off getting
your eyes done over the weekend,

767
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,631
Paul flew me to Martha's
Vineyard to show me this house

768
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:50,428
and it wasn't one of those stupid
Cape Cod houses the tourists love.

769
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,380
This was a year-round home

770
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,886
<i>where you could really be
a part of the island.</i>

771
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,640
Paul understands the
limitations of our job

772
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,810
and let's face it,

773
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,388
it's a short window,

774
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,064
and it's not really based
on skill.

775
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,733
Yeah, I know that.

776
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,481
Lucky for me,
my finances

777
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,234
have kind of been
taking care of themselves.

778
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,110
Sandwich guy told me
you nailed the baseball pool.

779
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,988
No, really, I'm coming
into a little piece of property

780
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,660
up in Lancaster myself.

781
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,328
I'll probably unload it.

782
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,156
Brian Williams
has a place up there.

783
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,116
I don't think so.

784
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,496
Thanks for the ride.

785
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,460
Which is why I'm sick and
tired of the bullshit.

786
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,260
Excuse me, sorry.

787
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,587
I was just passing through.

788
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,513
Sit, please.
Join us.

789
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,803
Everybody,
this is Angela...

790
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,229
my stepmother.

791
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,776
Didn't we meet
at the plastic bag rally?

792
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,480
Your skin is so white.

793
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,031
I think
we should listen now.

794
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,870
If we create
a nonprofit society,

795
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,868
we can reap the tax benefits

796
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,290
of said society.

797
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,208
It is going to be a beginning

798
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,332
and an ending of life
as we know it

799
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,210
and that is why I am calling it

800
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,461
The Omega Society.

801
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,544
I hate to stick my nose
into this, but...

802
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,552
No, everyone's voice
has equal merit.

803
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,635
The Omega Society sounds like
the Omega Institute.

804
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,220
<i>It's a holistic organization,</i>

805
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:26,024
environmentalism,
spiritual rebirth.

806
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,726
It's total synchronicity
is what it is.

807
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,528
Not only is it the perfect name
for our society,

808
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,153
but it already exists.

809
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,405
I think there's
an Omega Society, too,

810
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,077
so I don't think legally
we can...

811
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,905
Justin, it's not about
what is legal.

812
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,831
I grew up out here.

813
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,001
There are Amish people
on three sides of this farm.

814
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,875
They don't vote.
They don't join the Army.

815
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,549
They don't send their children
to our schools.

816
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,878
When you live off the land,

817
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,383
and you're honest,

818
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,385
things fall into place.

819
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,770
You are a beacon
to that Babylon out there.

820
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,350
My cousin lives in Oregon.

821
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,354
Ben's right.

822
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,619
So I've never seen you
at the Marriott before.

823
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,788
Oh, I really shouldn't.

824
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,365
You just going to go home and
stare at an empty dog bed?

825
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,291
Chester doesn't get home
from the hospital

826
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,086
till tomorrow, right?

827
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,913
His name is Clarence.

828
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,965
He got out
of the hospital today,

829
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,634
and my mom
is watching him.

830
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,132
But you sure are
a good listener.

831
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,633
So are you,

832
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,590
and a very
beautiful one actually.

833
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,807
I think Clarence
needs me.

834
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,733
Seriously,
I'm really fast.

835
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,987
Did you give my number
to someone?

836
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,314
I don't even have your...
Shh, one second.

837
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,990
Hello?

838
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,615
I really didn't mean
to bother you.

839
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:04,322
Ben's fine, but we just got
this registered letter.

840
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:05,827
Terri is challenging
the will.

841
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,783
Why? I mean,
I know why,

842
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,164
but under what grounds?

843
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,337
Well, it's Ben's competency.

844
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:14,507
There's going to be a hearing, and
he has to see a psychiatrist.

845
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,334
Can you believe this?

846
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,840
This morning, the bank
account was shut down.

847
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,297
It's a classic obstacle
to a pioneer.

848
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,475
It's like Galileo
or Che, or Jesus.

849
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,518
Every great move
has a counter move.

850
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,188
But let me tell you,
my sister's greed

851
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,516
is not going to stop the
evolution of mind and body

852
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,192
that's going on out here.

853
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,315
No, no, no, look.
You need to calm down.

854
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,863
- Just get a lawyer.
- A law...

855
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,030
You think I'm crazy now?

856
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,949
Go see the shrink.

857
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,905
It's like giving them the
money if you don't go.

858
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,117
I could be
my own lawyer you know.

859
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,416
There you go.

860
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,960
I could prepare a brief, one of those
600-page obstructionist babies.

861
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,003
They don't know
who they're fucking with.

862
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,466
Hey, are you still there?

863
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,843
Yes, any other fires
to put out?

864
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,051
It is just getting
more and more intense,

865
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,101
<i>and there are a lot of
other people involved now.</i>

866
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,057
Like you and me?

867
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,188
No, I mean, there are
these hippie kids now

868
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,567
and the store,
and now this court thing.

869
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,523
<i>He just seems
very agitated.</i>

870
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,075
And I mean, I've been trying
to deal with it, but...

871
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,903
I'm just glad
I could call you.

872
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,784
You can always
call me.

873
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,743
I'm leaving.
Maybe you should...

874
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,999
Oh, my God.
ls there someone there?

875
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:37,082
No, I'm alone.

876
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,416
Now.

877
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,593
<i>I'm sorry.
It's fine.</i>

878
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,888
You're just
doing your job.

879
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,715
My job, actually.

880
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,103
Well, I don't
really know him.

881
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,899
He's Ben. He's a blast
most of the time.

882
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,102
But you didn't know
his mother.

883
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,734
He inherited some things
that weren't in the will.

884
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,066
Yeah, Sam mentioned that.

885
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:07,120
Probably nothing like the free love,
whole foods thing you grew up in.

886
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:11,415
My father was an actuary for The
Hartford insurance company.

887
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,414
He died at his desk.
I was still at Andover.

888
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,293
Huh. Like say
about Sam's age?

889
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,500
What?
So you must be loaded?

890
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,467
Is he going to be okay
or not?

891
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,264
This is the way
it usually goes.

892
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,468
The best thing to do
is keep feeding him.

893
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,474
Food is nature's Vicodin.

894
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,931
That's good, too,
by the way, if you have it.

895
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:41,066
You should finally be getting
some rain up that way, you know?

896
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,944
Mm, I'm not too sure
about that.

897
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,501
Well...

898
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,207
goodnight.

899
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,426
Yeah, goodnight
to you, too.

900
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,213
Woo!

901
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,386
Wooooo!

902
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,213
Woo!

903
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,598
Wooooo!

904
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,982
<i>Ben?</i>

905
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,480
Ben?
Is he ready?

906
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,404
Ben, Terri's here.

907
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,152
I can't believe
you're doing this.

908
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,575
Yeah, well I can't believe
you're still here.

909
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,368
Ben?

910
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,162
Benji. We're going
to the doctor, okay?

911
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,865
There isn't anything to be...

912
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,000
Ben?

913
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,048
Great.

914
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,428
Why aren't you inside?

915
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,104
Greetings.

916
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,778
Sorry to keep bothering
you like that.

917
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,780
I don't think
getting a glass of water

918
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,112
is the biggest inconvenience
for these people right now.

919
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,413
I was just explaining
my admiration

920
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,956
for these people.

921
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,705
They live off the land
in kindness.

922
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,127
They don't believe
in war or pollution.

923
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:06,127
I'll tell you. One day, when there's
no earth left, because we used it up,

924
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,210
there will be 10 square miles of
Lancaster County where God still exists.

925
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,717
Why are you naked?

926
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,299
I didn't want that chemical
smell on me anymore.

927
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,430
That smell
is not chemicals.

928
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,807
It's B.O. because
you have stopped showering

929
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:22,106
and you ruined everything
I bought you at The Gap,

930
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,434
which you loved.
I don't anymore.

931
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,063
We are going.

932
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,941
This entire incident
is inappropriate

933
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,990
and probably illegal,
and if I were Mr. Yoder,

934
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,818
I would make you pay for the fact
that I missed two hours of farmwork

935
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,074
so I could ride into town
on a buggy

936
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,746
to get a cop out here.

937
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,915
You're wrong.
We're having a conversation!

938
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,833
I don't want
to speak out of turn here,

939
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,503
but Felty and Sarah
are not being hospitable.

940
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,502
They're pacifists,
and this is how they respond

941
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,299
to being held hostage.

942
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,846
Gosh, I'm...

943
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,681
I-I never meant to...
I didn't...

944
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,732
Ben, I think
you can keep the apron.

945
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:09,895
Let's go.

946
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,366
Yes, the best way to get
the soda out of the bottle

947
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,194
is to shake it and
shake it and shake it.

948
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,403
You need a ride?

949
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,364
Yes.

950
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,587
Next time,
go over to the highway

951
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,381
and get Anderson
to ring the fire bell for you.

952
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,049
I will.
I apologize.

953
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,002
I might have been
in a bit of a panic.

954
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,180
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Yoder.

955
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,349
I am sorry
to hear about your father.

956
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,721
Thank you very much.

957
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,552
We all miss him,
obviously.

958
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,229
He was lucky
to have a long life.

959
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,897
Such a caring daughter.

960
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,817
All he cared about
was his family.

961
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,691
Surely there's no other reason
for being on this Earth.

962
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,692
What would you do if you
couldn't have children?

963
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,369
I would pray to God
to send them to me.

964
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,536
What if you don't
believe in God?

965
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,582
Maybe that's why
you can't have children.

966
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,381
Honestly, Ben,
you really fucked me here.

967
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,683
My independence of mind
is obviously a threat to them.

968
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,227
Them?
Society.

969
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,679
With all their poison.

970
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,560
I'm not putting it
in my body.

971
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,686
And I respect that deep-fried
temple that you built,

972
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:32,066
but you have to stop
running naked.

973
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:34,112
I know.
I panicked.

974
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,441
Even the most committed messenger
has a moment of doubt.

975
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,196
Keep that word "committed"
in mind.

976
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,277
Next time. Oh, you
mean in the courtroom?

977
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,862
Because that's where
we're heading,

978
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,538
and they might not stop
with the money.

979
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,241
They can force you
to take the medicine,

980
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,622
and they can lock you up.

981
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,123
We're studying in here.

982
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,625
Anyone hungry?

983
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,705
Not really.

984
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,632
<i>L</i> got to go-

985
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,459
Be", you okay?

986
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,466
I don't know. I'm feeling
a little stressed out.

987
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,297
I'm stressed out.
You're crazy.

988
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,600
Let's use the word freely
as if it gives us power.

989
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,722
Goodnight.

990
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,820
I see you've been arrested
a few times.

991
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,739
Public outbursts,
indecency.

992
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,068
A misdemeanor
related to your profession

993
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,324
which you listed here
as "small farmer."

994
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,577
I also see that you've
never considered medication.

995
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,659
Anti-depressants?

996
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,961
They have been suggested,

997
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,006
as they have been
to most of America.

998
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,425
Well, I was thinking
more like a mood stabilizer,

999
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,174
which for most is a very
effective therapeutic solution.

1000
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:43,466
No need to resist
the magic of lithium, I know.

1001
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,849
We should sprinkle its salty goodness
over the fries at McDonald's

1002
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:50,227
until we're "Dawn of the Dead"
drooling towards Banana Republic,

1003
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,353
pushing our carts
dazed through the market,

1004
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,064
throwing the meat in,

1005
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:57,521
black blood pooling
under so much plastic.

1006
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,608
That's an interesting image.

1007
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,534
Which I wouldn't have
if I was zonked on that shit.

1008
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,577
I wouldn't feel
this hum I've got going.

1009
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,156
Clear, sharp,
and purposeful,

1010
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,209
like every ion in my body
is vibrating with genius.

1011
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,036
Marijuana is a chemical.

1012
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,541
It's green and from the Earth.

1013
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,167
But it's a drug,

1014
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,999
a way of dealing
with your symptoms.

1015
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,880
Like the drug you get
when you go into a restaurant

1016
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,882
or come home after work,

1017
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:23,214
or offer a stranger the moment
they come into your house.

1018
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:27,393
Our whole social system
is built around some drug.

1019
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,811
Most cultures made beer
before they had an alphabet.

1020
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,557
I'm going to ask you
some questions,

1021
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,735
and you can just tell me
yes or no, okay?

1022
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,030
Do you experience sensations
of things that are not there?

1023
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,950
Do you hear voices?

1024
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,874
Are you afraid right now?

1025
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,373
There are times
that are wonderful,

1026
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,927
and there are times
that are horrible.

1027
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:05,973
And the wonderful thing is
right now, I feel alive.

1028
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,096
But the terrible thing is
that you're not asking me

1029
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,802
how I feel
about my father dying.

1030
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,387
Oh, well I was going...

1031
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,064
I feel alone
in the universe,

1032
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,356
except for Steve.

1033
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,151
So why do you think
you're here?

1034
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,611
Because I won the lottery.

1035
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,696
Everybody's got their hand out.

1036
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,118
<i>Now action back
lo Barry with his suited ace.</i>

1037
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,624
<i>80,000 to call
to see a flop here.</i>

1038
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,252
<i>And he will have
position after.</i>

1039
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,557
Yes, yes,
you'll clean up later.

1040
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:05,365
No... motherfucking
goddamn dammit!

1041
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,488
Look at it.
It's huge.

1042
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,453
Leaves and acorns
everywhere.

1043
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,034
You got to get rid
of it.

1044
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,370
The building is called
The Oaks.

1045
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,704
It's the only one left.

1046
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,664
It's just a tree.

1047
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,340
It blocks
all the natural light,

1048
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:25,173
Plus, it decreases
the value of my unit.

1049
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,554
I can circulate a petition
if you want,

1050
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,472
but you know
everybody feels the same,

1051
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,301
and you got to be sick
of cleaning up all this crap.

1052
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,137
I'll see what I can do.

1053
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,518
Great, that's all I can ask.

1054
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,024
Oh, and Steve...

1055
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,567
thanks for
the Oriole tickets.

1056
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,440
Freebies, Arman.
Don't be impressed.

1057
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,528
<i>I happen to
be in charge here.</i>

1058
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,036
<i>Stop asking me
where the debate is,</i>

1059
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,045
<i>because I'm not going.</i>

1060
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,877
<i>Ben? We all agreed on
the starting place,</i>

1061
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,924
<i>and that's where
it's going to be.</i>

1062
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,752
<i>and it's not about whose
got the most...</i>

1063
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,257
Ben, who's in there
with you?

1064
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,589
Hey.

1065
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,390
Were you on the phone?

1066
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,683
No.

1067
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,395
My diagnosis,
as I wrote,

1068
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,572
is classic bipolar disorder.

1069
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,573
Euphoric
with schizoid tendencies.

1070
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:31,577
See? I told you.

1071
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,779
So in your assessment,
Dr. Vincent,

1072
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:36,035
you see Mr. Baker
as being incapable

1073
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,957
of understanding
any consequences

1074
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,080
for his actions.

1075
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,786
Yes.

1076
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,748
That is all we have
to say, Your Honor.

1077
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,423
Uh, Mr. Baker...

1078
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,046
have you been having difficulty

1079
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,798
distinguishing
between real and unreal?

1080
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,629
My whole life.

1081
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,389
This is
a very serious diagnosis.

1082
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:00,723
Would you describe him as a danger
to himself or to other people?

1083
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,934
Actually, I would say no.

1084
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,610
Not at this moment.

1085
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,063
It is, of course,
completely possible.

1086
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,898
Well, I'm prepared
to rule on this.

1087
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,824
<i>Mr. Baker, Ms. Coulter,</i>

1088
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,449
I have to agree
with Dr. Vincent's finding

1089
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:18,123
that Mr. Baker is... I'm sorry to talk
about you as though you weren't here,

1090
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,951
but this 11-page
handwritten brief

1091
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,502
didn't help, son.

1092
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,751
He is seriously
mentally troubled.

1093
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,629
And he's likely to behave
with this money

1094
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,460
in a extremely
irresponsible manner.

1095
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,638
But hopefully, he won't,

1096
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,636
because as long as he's not a
threat to himself or other people,

1097
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:39,015
he can go out and buy the world's
largest hat, if he wants to.

1098
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,813
Your Honor,
you don't understand.

1099
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,691
Look, your father could have
left his money to his dog.

1100
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,234
The law is crystal clear.

1101
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,061
If the government
gets their piece,

1102
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,147
the mandates of the deceased
are to be observed.

1103
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,152
Ben, I'm just looking out
for you, I swear.

1104
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,862
No, I'm looking out
for you.

1105
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:59,039
Every time
I think you're crazy

1106
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,492
along comes
the justice system.

1107
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,496
Woo!

1108
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,331
Is this great or what?

1109
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,384
Yeah, Glenlivet scotch
in a shit hole like this?

1110
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,835
I'm buying everything.

1111
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,841
Bartender, drinks
on the house!

1112
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,048
My man!
Yeah!

1113
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,304
I am not buying
everybody a drink.

1114
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,479
No, I think he means
drinks are on him.

1115
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,682
What did I say?

1116
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:29,190
Hey, my mom... my mom just
gave me the message.

1117
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,738
Congratulations. Oh, thanks.
It means so much.

1118
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,861
I don't know if you've ever
met my friend, Steve Dallas.

1119
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,072
Steve, this is Zed Starkevitch.
Hi.

1120
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,495
He's kind of the chief administrator
of the whole Omega Society.

1121
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,039
I guess we should be saying
congratulations to you.

1122
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,995
Can we get another beer?

1123
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,543
To transforming society
from within.

1124
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:49,999
To being a tapeworm

1125
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,334
gnawing
on its intestines,

1126
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,091
sucking and feeding
on the bile and waste,

1127
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,889
growing stronger
every minute.

1128
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:00,551
Okay, I'm going to let
you two celebrate.

1129
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,228
Zed, can your mom
take you and Ben home?

1130
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,808
My mom's blind.

1131
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,691
I'm bottling this moment.

1132
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:42,134
You done
celebrating?

1133
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,764
You got to come
out here.

1134
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,265
You got to see this.

1135
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,806
Where's Ben?
Still hanging out.

1136
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,608
Look at all these stars.

1137
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,901
Have you seen this?

1138
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:54,901
Yeah.

1139
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,277
Yeah, I have.

1140
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:57,486
<i>H's pretty great.</i>

1141
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,502
Can you dance?

1142
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,959
You can't handle it.

1143
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,302
Come over here.

1144
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,738
What is this?

1145
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,324
What are you
talking about?

1146
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,486
Don't mess with me.

1147
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,155
This. This place
and you.

1148
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,369
You, your face.

1149
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,161
I don't know
what to say.

1150
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,170
Because you like me.

1151
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,350
What?

1152
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,521
Kiss me again
or slap me or something,

1153
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,224
but you got to stop looking
at me all beautiful like that,

1154
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,275
or you're going
to get more of this.

1155
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,736
So you'd like more?

1156
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,400
I don't know.

1157
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:22,826
I don't know
who you are.

1158
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:25,029
I know it's horrible.

1159
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,697
But this is really it.

1160
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,240
This is who I am.

1161
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:29,700
There's some good
in it, I promise.

1162
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,080
I have hobbies and stuff.

1163
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,581
I always pick up
the check.

1164
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,003
You're stoned.

1165
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,422
You're always stoned.

1166
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:36,999
Actually, I'm drunk
right now,

1167
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,709
but again, that's part
of who I am.

1168
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,420
My personal ad?
"Loves to have a good time."

1169
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:42,880
That's what I mean.

1170
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,464
I eat life
out of the big box.

1171
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,549
I'm not hiding out here
in the sticks

1172
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:48,727
or wherever it is
you're going to next.

1173
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,387
Doesn't it seem strange

1174
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,724
that someone who
eats life like you do,

1175
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,686
who has it all,
is trying to escape it?

1176
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,566
I like you.

1177
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,072
I bet you haven't had
an interaction with anyone

1178
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,900
in the last ten years
that wasn't warped somehow.

1179
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:08,409
My guess is you got some kind
of freefall going on in there,

1180
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,788
but you hide it all
under this veil of charm

1181
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:14,790
that people prefer
to real interaction.

1182
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,463
I don't.

1183
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,337
You think I'm charming?

1184
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,759
Just to be clear,

1185
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,183
if I'm sober,
you're interested?

1186
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,927
Goodnight.

1187
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:54,417
People treat the environment
like it's a big toilet.

1188
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,852
They can dump everything they
don't want, and flush it down,

1189
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,668
and they're never
going to see it again.

1190
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,669
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1191
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,460
Excuse me?

1192
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,469
People get
a little bit of money,

1193
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,298
all of a sudden, they think
everything they say is true.

1194
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,258
You're still a big fat nothing.

1195
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,684
What?

1196
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,511
You're just a crazy jackoff

1197
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,814
making bullshit plans
that will never amount

1198
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,766
to anything,
because that's what you are.

1199
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:18,941
Nothing.

1200
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,155
Holy shit!

1201
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,486
Who are you?

1202
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,612
Who do you think you are?

1203
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,658
Huh?

1204
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,573
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

1205
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,594
Ben, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

1206
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:33,827
Did you hear
what he said to me?

1207
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,492
I just ordered a beer.

1208
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,215
Ben, I heard him, man.
That's all he said.

1209
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,411
You're fucking crazy, man.

1210
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:55,186
So you talk to the doctor
and I'll talk to Slochum.

1211
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,808
He's okay?

1212
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,019
Yeah, couple
of stitches.

1213
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,234
Well, tell him
I'm really sorry.

1214
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:12,033
Solomon, why don't you have a seat
while your dad and I have a word?

1215
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,739
Ben, I'll be with you
in a minute.

1216
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,371
Let me get some coffee.
I'll run you home after.

1217
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,052
Hey.

1218
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,178
Hi.

1219
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,229
You ever read
this shit?

1220
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,683
I mean, every issue
is exactly the same.

1221
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,518
<i>I guess.</i>

1222
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,353
I mean, look at this.

1223
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,814
Why do you need a toothbrush
on a desert island?

1224
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,076
Why are you here?

1225
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,413
Because I talk
to God.

1226
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:02,875
Oh, really?

1227
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,543
Why are you here?

1228
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,258
Me?
I don't know.

1229
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,554
They want me to take
some medication,

1230
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,260
be like everybody else.

1231
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,776
Solomon, we'll see you
again on Thursday, okay?

1232
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,448
Ben, shall we?

1233
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,826
God wants you
to take your medicine.

1234
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,304
Seat belt.

1235
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,535
He's still asleep.

1236
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:08,580
It's incredible that a woman
with such a great hangover cure

1237
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,210
would be against drinking.

1238
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:12,546
I'm not against drinking.

1239
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,923
Do you remember Sam at all?

1240
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,504
Have you talked
to Terri?

1241
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,510
She doesn't know
what to do.

1242
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,887
She's just going to wait
until it doesn't look so bad,

1243
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,723
which means it's over.

1244
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,645
I think even Ben
knows that.

1245
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,473
Well, I guess you could
come back to the city with me,

1246
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,229
and I know what you're
going to say about cities,

1247
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,026
but it's Annapolis,
not really even a city.

1248
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,070
But why would I
go with you?

1249
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:35,274
What about dinner?
Can I stay?

1250
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,858
Can we think
that far ahead?

1251
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,284
What about your job?

1252
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,282
I can't face
doing the weather

1253
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:43,581
in this completely
unadulterated, unpolluted state.

1254
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,751
Plus, every time I leave here,
something terrible happens.

1255
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:49,079
He's a grown man.

1256
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,039
I mean,
it's admirable, but...

1257
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,591
I don't think the issues
of his life are your problem.

1258
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,376
My problem?
You just spent

1259
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,303
the last five years
taking care of Methuselah.

1260
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,880
We were married.

1261
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,510
See, nobody believes
in friendship.

1262
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,093
People talk about it.
You see it on TV.

1263
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:06,305
People drop by and then
go to the doctor together.

1264
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:07,934
No one eats alone.

1265
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,985
But most people are alone.

1266
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,811
That's the thing
about friendship.

1267
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,318
It's a lot rarer than love.

1268
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,900
Because there's nothing
in it for anybody.

1269
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,122
They're just two forms
of the same thing.

1270
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,752
Don't you want me
to stay for dinner?

1271
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,079
I'll let you cook.

1272
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,960
Just go easy on the sherry.

1273
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,461
Remember our agreement.

1274
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,133
We don't have an agreement.

1275
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,503
Do you like chicken?

1276
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,385
Like? Try love.

1277
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,772
Go get one.

1278
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,191
You want me to kill
someone at the store for it?

1279
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,853
Are you kidding?

1280
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:58,486
Come on, take it.

1281
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,282
You want to be here?
Be here.

1282
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,010
It's like picking out
a lobster.

1283
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,780
Goddammit.

1284
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,423
Shit.

1285
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,492
It's okay.

1286
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,576
It's okay.

1287
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,252
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

1288
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,205
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

1289
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,756
It's... it's all right.

1290
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,041
It's going to be okay.

1291
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,883
Who am I kidding?

1292
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,445
Oh, shit.
I'm so sorry.

1293
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:02,776
I'm sorry.

1294
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,565
Oh, fuck.

1295
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:05,650
Shit.

1296
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,666
Jesus...

1297
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,661
Dinner.

1298
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:08,970
Is that him?

1299
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,389
Her.

1300
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,341
Smells pretty good.

1301
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:16,853
Hey, everybody.

1302
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,560
I feel like we should
say grace or something.

1303
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:28,528
Steve?

1304
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,159
Fine, fine,
I killed the chicken.

1305
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:31,861
Am I supposed
to feel bad about that?

1306
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,241
People do it every day.

1307
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,993
No, they really don't.

1308
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,040
Well, then how am I
supposed to feel?

1309
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:39,042
I don't know.

1310
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,335
Grateful, maybe?

1311
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,247
Oh...

1312
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,383
Right.

1313
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,719
Um...

1314
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:59,897
Thank you, God,
and this chicken,

1315
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:04,648
of course, who made
the ultimate sacrifice

1316
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:11,239
in harm's way.

1317
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,573
Uh, amen.

1318
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,830
Great, let's eat.

1319
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,747
Would you?

1320
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,130
I thought I was going
to have a problem with this,

1321
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:36,809
but damn,
that's a juicy bird.

1322
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,179
It does smell
really good.

1323
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,268
You want some?

1324
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:51,148
Yeah, I think I do.

1325
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:13,796
<i>Ben?</i>

1326
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,644
Okay, you got my phone number.

1327
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,892
Oh...

1328
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,145
Here, take it.
It's my last one.

1329
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,775
I'm going to lay off
for a while.

1330
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,819
What am I going to do
with one joint?

1331
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,942
Better try and get by,
but when I come back,

1332
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,740
I'm bringing you the biggest
bag of dope you've ever seen.

1333
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:36,285
I don't think so. Okay, maybe
you've seen a bigger one.

1334
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,158
But I'm bringing a lot.

1335
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,664
Do what you want. I don't
know where I'll be.

1336
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,746
That's kind of ominous.

1337
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,827
And because
of its non sequitur nature,

1338
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:46,837
I'm going to take that
as a yes on the weed.

1339
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:49,590
Why don't you take
all of this as clarity?

1340
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,258
You don't have
to come back, okay?

1341
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,131
Suddenly you're going
to get your own weed?

1342
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,678
Look, I'm done.
That's it. It's over.

1343
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,006
What are you talking about?

1344
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:00,184
I'm talking about, we took this ski
lift to the top of the mountain.

1345
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,016
We got off. You're going one
way, and I'm going the other.

1346
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,348
There's only one way
to go, down.

1347
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:06,899
You can't get on the lift
without me.

1348
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,601
In fact,
you can't even ski.

1349
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,732
I can ski. When have
you been skiing?

1350
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,314
You told that girl you could
ski and I backed you up on it,

1351
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,990
but you'd never been skiing.

1352
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:16,533
Then you told her
you'd never been skiing,

1353
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,407
and you sold me out,
remember?

1354
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,863
Forget about skiing.
You're talking stupid shit.

1355
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,040
I need you to take this
seriously for once.

1356
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,367
Take something seriously!

1357
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,997
Oh, I get it.

1358
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,874
You're strong.
All has been revealed.

1359
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,500
I'm just saying
this is my problem,

1360
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,048
and you're exacerbating it.

1361
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,342
You are truly batshit.

1362
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,795
I'm sure it's scary to take fixing
me off your list of things to do,

1363
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,380
because all that's left
is fixing you.

1364
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:38,715
Oh, wow.

1365
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,390
Thank you for that.

1366
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:42,059
Yeah, 'cause I'm
the selfish one here.

1367
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,977
There's no chance
you're the asshole.

1368
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:47,557
Look, you don't know me,
and you don't owe me, okay?

1369
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:51,228
<i>Well, if you feel the need to punch
me in the balls knock yourself out.</i>

1370
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:55,569
I'll try to clear my schedule for the
next time the clarity wears off.

1371
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,823
Are you going?

1372
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,249
Yeah, I got to get back.

1373
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,750
Oh.

1374
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:09,253
I got the job, you know.

1375
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:12,085
No, of course.

1376
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,749
You don't want
to walk me to the car?

1377
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,668
Well, if you're leaving,
you're leaving.

1378
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,219
I mean, I can call you
or something.

1379
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:18,921
Well, do you
not want me to go?

1380
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:21,386
Well, it's not going
to be easy here.

1381
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,934
And not because
I'm pining for you.

1382
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,721
I mean, you know
I'm not going to leave.

1383
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:29,774
You're counting on it, so
really, you're just using me.

1384
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,102
And throw in the fact that...

1385
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:34,895
maybe I do have feelings.

1386
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:36,947
Oh, God,
so do I.

1387
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:41,118
No... half a day sobriety
isn't going to open that door.

1388
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,742
Oh, you can still
walk me outside, you know.

1389
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,619
No funny business,
I promise.

1390
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,371
You should go.

1391
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,122
I'll stay here until I feel
okay about going.

1392
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,169
So you can feel okay
about going.

1393
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,479
<i>Now, about
this tropical depression</i>

1394
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:19,398
brewing off the Florida Keys,

1395
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,325
it's too early to tell
if this Gulf air will hold

1396
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,495
and create
hurricane conditions.

1397
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,164
So Victoria,
we will keep an eye on that.

1398
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:29,491
Thank you, Steve.

1399
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,373
We certainly will.

1400
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,164
State officials
announced today...

1401
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,169
Dallas?
Steve Dallas?

1402
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,837
<i>Yes, mein fuhrer.</i> ..

1403
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,631
You know,
for a second out there,

1404
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,933
I thought
you were sober.

1405
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,511
Then I realized you're probably on
some drug I've never even heard of.

1406
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,304
Look at this shit.

1407
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,685
Why don't they get us tubes,
like astronauts?

1408
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:55,192
I don't know. The
sandwiches are pretty good.

1409
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,023
Chicken baloney?

1410
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,813
Do you have any idea
where that even comes from?

1411
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:01,194
Yeah, a chicken.

1412
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:02,991
It's a lot harder
than that.

1413
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,367
I didn't know
you painted.

1414
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,751
I don't really.

1415
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,955
But somehow,
tracing these lines

1416
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,879
is really going to help me
remember this place.

1417
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,383
'Cause let's face it,
the next time I come back

1418
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:20,710
it probably won't be here.

1419
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,420
Thanks for cheering me up.

1420
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:25,218
Try it.

1421
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,066
I really screwed up.

1422
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:41,026
It wasn't in your control.

1423
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:47,490
Gauguin packed up as far from
this craphole as possible.

1424
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,448
The world wasn't even one tenth
as polluted as it is now.

1425
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,920
You feel like packing up?

1426
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,832
No.

1427
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,087
I don't even feel that.

1428
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:03,253
I just feel like...

1429
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,762
it's a pretty nice day, and...

1430
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:08,299
I hate myself for being the guy
who only has that to say.

1431
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:26,200
Need another club soda,
Mr. Dallas?

1432
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,778
Does anyone ever need
another club soda?

1433
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,571
What's going on here?

1434
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,452
<i>Oh, a real estate seminar.</i>

1435
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:35,117
Lot of ladies trying
to change their lives.

1436
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,267
Is it good?

1437
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:04,150
It's filled with bizarre details
and super weird bullshit.

1438
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:06,691
You've never read anything you
liked that was like that?

1439
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:09,242
It was not me.

1440
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:11,241
Actually, it was me.

1441
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,664
That's what makes it so depressing.
Now it's just this.

1442
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,950
Unfinished, unfocused,
unrelenting.

1443
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:24,004
I'm a guy in a desert that's
running towards a mirage.

1444
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,715
I'm still really thirsty,
and my mouth is full of sand.

1445
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,510
Write that down.

1446
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,299
I don't think it's mine.

1447
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,473
It's going to take time.

1448
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,304
I just wish it was some
crippling depression

1449
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,685
instead of this disappointment.

1450
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,438
How do you all live here
without looking

1451
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,360
for a high place
to jump from?

1452
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,688
I can't sell you on life.

1453
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,694
Because there's
nothing to it.

1454
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:51,868
Nothing at all.

1455
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,369
Life doesn't stand up
to thinking.

1456
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,873
Smell the air out there.

1457
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,587
There are wonders.

1458
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,808
All I feel is time passing.

1459
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,685
And it's overwhelming.

1460
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:24,397
I wasted so much.

1461
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,402
I gobbled it all down

1462
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,564
without even tasting it.

1463
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,734
So start over.

1464
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,743
Just like that.

1465
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,803
I'm sorry. I'm going to give it
ten more minutes if that's okay.

1466
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,472
That's decaf, right?

1467
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,397
Sorry I'm late.

1468
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,870
Oh, my God.
You shaved.

1469
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:43,498
What can I say?
You know how erratic I am.

1470
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:45,371
What did you want
to talk to me about, Ben?

1471
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,124
Actually, I wanted
to thank you.

1472
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:51,047
I didn't wait 40 minutes for you to show up
so we could have a fight. Terri, I mean it.

1473
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,717
I can't help but think that...
even through all this,

1474
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:58,347
that what Dad wanted was for us
to deal with all this together.

1475
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:00,675
I'm sorry, but I know
you're only one sentence away

1476
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,634
from telling me
you want to turn the store

1477
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,642
into an 1850's laundromat

1478
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,894
that runs on whale oil
or something.

1479
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:10,021
Except God forbid
anybody hurt a whale.

1480
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,352
No.

1481
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:16,073
I have become
acutely aware

1482
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:17,574
of my limitations.

1483
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,117
And I guess
what I'm saying is

1484
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,570
is that whatever
you have in mind

1485
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:22,737
I'm okay with it.

1486
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,539
Excuse me?

1487
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:25,706
Are you wearing
a wire?

1488
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,910
I'm serious.

1489
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,917
Well, I've been
tossing around the idea

1490
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:33,169
of converting the store
into something more modern.

1491
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,046
And profitable?
Is that a sin?

1492
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,173
No, that's good. That's
what I wanted to hear.

1493
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,772
Because I have some plans
for the farm.

1494
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:42,595
What, give it to Angela?
Perfect.

1495
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:44,927
You don't even know her.

1496
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,763
Yeah, I know she has some freaky
power over all the men in my family.

1497
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,940
And that probably comes
from under her sundress.

1498
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:53,610
Terri,
I'm asking you please.

1499
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,236
Don't talk about her
like that.

1500
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:00,279
Okay...

1501
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,622
Okay.

1502
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:07,783
It's a million dollars
of undeveloped land.

1503
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:10,293
And that's why I want to have a
say about what happens to it.

1504
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:11,620
And you get lunch.

1505
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,456
Look, whatever it takes.

1506
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,837
I just don't want it
to be like this anymore.

1507
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,519
You look just like Dad.

1508
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,478
Okay, we feed in 15 seconds.

1509
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:33,938
Come on, people.

1510
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:35,394
I don't have
a fucking image.

1511
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,479
All right,
this is a newsroom.

1512
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,940
Can I get some people
walking back and forth please?

1513
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,991
And let's clean up this...
oh, forget it.

1514
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:45,825
Three, two...

1515
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,783
As promised, we're continuing
to track this storm

1516
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,583
now from the National
Weather Service

1517
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:53,162
known officially
as Hurricane Gordon

1518
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:56,499
about to make landfall
just south of Charleston here.

1519
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,963
Expect 85 mile-per-hour winds

1520
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,339
and flooding.

1521
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:02,004
Two to three inches per hour.

1522
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,718
Now you folks in the area,

1523
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,640
whether the government
makes you or not,

1524
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,809
just get yourselves
out of there.

1525
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:10,637
Your lives are a hell of a lot
more important than your houses.

1526
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:14,350
<i>This is Steve Dallas in the
Channel 18 Storm Center.</i>

1527
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:17,811
Stay dry and stay safe.

1528
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:19,521
And we're out.

1529
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,527
Nicely done, yes!

1530
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:24,200
I loved that bit about
the people down in Charleston.

1531
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:25,986
Our local old ladies
are going to cream.

1532
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:28,117
From what Delia tells me,

1533
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:30,574
this is a hell of a storm. Those
people needed to be warned.

1534
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:33,706
Yeah, well those people
lost power six hours ago.

1535
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,211
They're not watching TV.

1536
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,837
Jesus, really?

1537
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:40,542
So why the hell
are we doing this?

1538
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,468
Local people
are interested.

1539
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:44,342
They might run us national

1540
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:46,461
unless those douchebags
in Baltimore snake us again.

1541
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,023
<i>I don't want to bother you.</i>

1542
01:29:56,099 --> 01:30:00,149
Oh, I'm just going through
some of your dad's stuff.

1543
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,072
I probably should have buried
him in his madras shorts.

1544
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,905
Would have felt
more like a vacation.

1545
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,910
I talked to Terri
like you suggested.

1546
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:09,196
It wasn't bad, right?

1547
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:10,371
It was great.

1548
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:12,495
And um...

1549
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:13,951
the other night, too.

1550
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,712
That really happened,
didn't it?

1551
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:19,414
Yes.

1552
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,090
Yes, it did.

1553
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,043
I can't tell you
how much that meant.

1554
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:26,130
Well, someone had to welcome
you back to the world.

1555
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,519
How did you end up
with my dad?

1556
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:37,600
Uh... I guess
it was all this.

1557
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:44,941
It's hard to resist the temptation
to step into a normal life.

1558
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,944
I know you told my dad
you didn't want anything.

1559
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,862
Yeah, I said that.

1560
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:53,574
And I really
meant it, but...

1561
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:56,877
you think he would just give
me like one little thing.

1562
01:30:56,952 --> 01:31:00,456
Anything, just
for sentimental reasons,

1563
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:02,090
a gesture.

1564
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,088
Well, you deserve
whatever you want.

1565
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,544
I keep trying to find a way...

1566
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,631
No, no, no.
Not from you.

1567
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,925
I mean, it's sweet.
Thank you, but...

1568
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,765
it's not the same.

1569
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:17,688
I thought since, you know, you didn't
know what you were going to do

1570
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,108
that you could talk to Steve
about the farm and the house.

1571
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:22,151
I'm sure he doesn't know
what he's going to do either.

1572
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,649
What do you mean?

1573
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,822
I'm giving this all to Dallas.

1574
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,487
What?

1575
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,989
I promised it to him
after the will.

1576
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:32,616
Huh.

1577
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,241
I didn't know that.

1578
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,167
It's an odd marriage,
but I kind of owed it to him.

1579
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:41,213
Why, did you want it?
No, mm-mm.

1580
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:43,456
Are you okay?

1581
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,669
Sure. You?

1582
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:49,345
Yeah, Terri's going to help
me find a smaller place.

1583
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:55,557
I'll never forget how you
held this family together.

1584
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,203
<i>It's me. I hope
I'm using this right.</i>

1585
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,117
<i>It keeps asking me
to press star,</i>

1586
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,703
<i>which I don't think
we have on this phone.</i>

1587
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:23,122
<i>Oh, there it is.</i>

1588
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:26,674
<i>Uh, listen man...</i>

1589
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,002
<i>Listen, man,
I know we haven't talked.</i>

1590
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,961
<i>I'm just going to say it.</i>

1591
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,389
<i>I miss you, and I've been
thinking about things</i>

1592
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,182
<i>and I want to make good
on things.</i>

1593
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:39,058
<i>And I know Angela miss...</i>

1594
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,972
<i>Okay, now I've got to talk fast,
because if I stop talking</i>

1595
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,603
<i>the thing will cut me off.</i>

1596
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:43,979
<i>Come down
if you're ever free</i>

1597
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,436
<i>and I'm good, bye.</i>

1598
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:50,899
<i>Hello?</i>

1599
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:56,572
Morning, slugger.
Four reports in six hours.

1600
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,531
Station manager's wet dream.

1601
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:00,834
You got two hours to get
cleaned up for your 12:30.

1602
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:03,082
That's it.
I'm done.

1603
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:07,215
What? I think it's time you find
a new entertainment reporter,

1604
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,338
someone who's
comfortable with...

1605
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,010
what a waste of time
this is,

1606
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:12,929
someone who isn't aware
of the fact that

1607
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:15,928
any six year old can stick
their arm out the window

1608
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,931
and tell you what it's
going to be like today.

1609
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:22,514
Dave, I would like
to introduce you

1610
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,567
to Delia,
an actual meteorologist

1611
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:27,940
and yeah, she doesn't
look like Miss America.

1612
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:30,275
She looks like someone
who went to MIT,

1613
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:31,781
because she did.

1614
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,574
Can't you ever
just make it easy?

1615
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:36,950
Do you have to suck
the good out of everything?

1616
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,325
Good luck, sweetheart.

1617
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:44,453
He kissed me.

1618
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:13,280
Amish Farms Superstore?

1619
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:15,484
Yes, but without
the question mark.

1620
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,323
If you believed in anything,

1621
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:19,996
you would realize this is
why people go to hell.

1622
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,323
Have you talked
to Ben?

1623
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:22,623
Ben agreed to this?

1624
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:23,996
Underground parking?

1625
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:25,418
Honestly, we spoke,

1626
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:26,995
in rational means
as a family

1627
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:28,500
and this was the decision
that we made.

1628
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,002
And luckily
for the both of us

1629
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,583
you're not part
of the family.

1630
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,259
No, no, congratulations.
You won.

1631
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:34,756
And I don't mean
the battle over the will.

1632
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:36,634
I mean for biggest
twat of the year.

1633
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:39,432
Boy, you really don't know
how to talk to a woman

1634
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,009
you're not trying to screw.

1635
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,685
Ben and I reconciled,

1636
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,603
and your opposition
to that makes me feel

1637
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,306
like you just don't
want to be alone

1638
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,517
in whatever
weed-powered dance

1639
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,103
you two have shared
for the last 25 years.

1640
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,029
I want him to get better.

1641
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:56,199
Then for once,
leave him be.

1642
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:59,528
He is going to have
a lifetime of prosperity.

1643
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:02,330
And I'm sure he and Angela
will be very happy.

1644
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:04,908
What?

1645
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:07,369
Maybe it's sick, but those
two found each other.

1646
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,505
I know it sounds weird,
but I actually believe

1647
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,207
that my brother
and my stepmother

1648
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,712
belong together.

1649
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,886
Wait, they're together?
Says who?

1650
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:20,056
Oh, Steve,
they are.

1651
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,054
Sorry, you're going to have
to find someone else

1652
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:23,726
who's in worse shape
than you now.

1653
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,769
Go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself, too.

1654
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,738
Beard.
Yeah.

1655
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,565
You like it?
ls Angela here?

1656
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:39,572
I don't know
if you got my messages.

1657
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,403
I wanted you to come so I
could tell you the great news

1658
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:43,329
that the farm is yours

1659
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:45,406
to do whatever you want with.
Fan-fucking-tastic.

1660
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,582
Angela around?

1661
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:48,251
Now, don't be mad,

1662
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,328
but Terri's going to get
the store.

1663
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,664
- It's just the best way to go.
- That is great, great news.

1664
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:53,919
Do you know
where Angela is?

1665
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,215
Are you okay?

1666
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:56,884
<i>I think she's upstairs.</i>

1667
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,429
Upstairs where you
were just screwing her?

1668
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:02,223
<i>What</i> are you talking about? I don't
know if you were just screwing her.

1669
01:36:02,298 --> 01:36:03,720
That's a weird thing
to say.

1670
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,768
Really?
Because it is sick.

1671
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:10,766
If it isn't Amish country's
own Mary Magdalene.

1672
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,605
<i>Did you wash his feet first</i>

1673
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,436
or just pull him down
off the cross and bone him?

1674
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:16,112
Hold on. Calm down. What?

1675
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:17,860
You're being very...
No, stay out of this.

1676
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,459
I'm warning you, Ben.
Stay out of this.

1677
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:20,904
Why are you angry?

1678
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:22,452
Because you fucked
my friend.

1679
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,950
Who told you that?
Everybody knows.

1680
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,622
That's none of your business.

1681
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,075
I guess nothing
was none of my business.

1682
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:29,784
I never promised you anything.

1683
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,790
You got the farm.
Isn't that what you wanted?

1684
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:35,965
Stop it! I'm not going to have the two people I
care about most in the world fight like this.

1685
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:38,468
You got it all wrong.
Now cool it.

1686
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:40,762
Fine, fine.

1687
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:45,971
What happened?

1688
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:58,317
Oh, God.
This is so bad.

1689
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:02,154
You assholes, both of you.
Such assholes.

1690
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:05,988
You don't care about anything. Jesus,
you know what she means to me.

1691
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,072
It's not what you think.

1692
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:10,500
L-I didn't know, but it doesn't
change anything, I swear.

1693
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:12,248
The hell it doesn't!

1694
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:14,125
I thought I meant something
to you.

1695
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:16,251
Because I thought
you were helping a sick friend,

1696
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,958
not making a real estate deal.

1697
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,668
What?
I was!

1698
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,628
But aren't I entitled
to something?

1699
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,509
Yes!

1700
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:25,340
You don't know
where I have been,

1701
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:28,176
the shit I have done
to deserve you.

1702
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:43,028
I talked to Terri...

1703
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,576
and it's yours to do
whatever you want with it.

1704
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:50,532
And... don't know
what to say except...

1705
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:52,162
I hope you take a look
at yourself...

1706
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:53,868
and realize
how much is there.

1707
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,380
Steve...

1708
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:59,298
you got to get
your shit together.

1709
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:11,390
I hope one day you find out
what you really care about.

1710
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,312
I hope one day you learn
to solve a problem

1711
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:16,232
without sleeping
with it.

1712
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:19,064
What happened between me and
Ben had nothing to do with you

1713
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,895
or my feelings for you.

1714
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:23,281
Oh, come on. You sell
all this nature shit

1715
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:25,484
and honesty and feelings,

1716
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:28,445
when you're just this empty little
girl with no responsibilities

1717
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:30,826
who gets anything
and everybody she wants

1718
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:32,953
because she's
so goddamn pretty.

1719
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,126
And believe me, I know
what I'm talking about.

1720
01:38:35,201 --> 01:38:38,205
I do the weather
on TV.

1721
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,381
You got a week
to get off my land.

1722
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,644
I got that.

1723
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,222
Thanks.

1724
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,522
You're the new guy?

1725
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:43,603
Pulled all the strings
and got a south unit?

1726
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,404
Sorry.

1727
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,902
I'm Natalie.

1728
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,153
That's Connor.

1729
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:49,317
Ben.

1730
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:04,833
Buenos dias.

1731
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:13,933
You wanted to see me?
Wanted to see you?

1732
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:15,260
<i>I was calling you...</i>

1733
01:40:15,343 --> 01:40:16,515
What is that?

1734
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:18,016
Last one in the case.

1735
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:19,472
You're out of luck.

1736
01:40:19,555 --> 01:40:21,057
Ah, hell.

1737
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:23,142
I must have called you
100 times.

1738
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:26,321
You never answered. I just thought
you wanted to fire Delia.

1739
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:27,897
And obviously,
I was right.

1740
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,823
Interesting thing
about Delia.

1741
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:31,446
I ran it by corporate,

1742
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:33,199
and if she promises
to get a boob job,

1743
01:40:33,236 --> 01:40:34,704
which she's on board with,

1744
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:36,535
she can do the weather.

1745
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:38,036
Why did you want
to see me?

1746
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:40,076
With Victoria
getting married...

1747
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,753
God, I never thought
that was going to happen.

1748
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:45,297
With Victoria
getting married,

1749
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:47,216
there's an opening
on the anchor desk.

1750
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,760
Now as much <i>as</i> I prefer
someone who shows up,

1751
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,553
<i>after the last Storm Watch</i>

1752
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:53,055
<i>and then you disappearing
like that,</i>

1753
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:55,224
we received,
like, 7000 letters

1754
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:56,892
expressing
their concern for you

1755
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:58,265
and a wish
to see you again.

1756
01:40:58,344 --> 01:40:59,971
You mean seven letters.

1757
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:01,897
The point is

1758
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:03,228
we have an opening

1759
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,355
if you want it.
The big seat.

1760
01:41:05,434 --> 01:41:07,812
Plus, now we've got
this totally stacked chick

1761
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:09,647
next to you
doing the weather,

1762
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:11,824
and you'll never want
for money.

1763
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:14,652
God, I'm just wondering

1764
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:16,737
what it would take
to get fired around here.

1765
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:23,078
Is this your coffee or mine,

1766
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,332
because I have
to drive home.

1767
01:41:24,412 --> 01:41:26,255
They're all
my coffee.

1768
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:29,341
Overpaid prick.

1769
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:30,634
<i>Five seconds.</i>

1770
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,843
Good afternoon, Annapolis.

1771
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,674
Federal investigators
responding...

1772
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:22,053
You missed my shower.

1773
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:24,889
Sorry, I got hit
by a pile of money.

1774
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:28,067
Any lots available near you
on Martha's Vineyard?

1775
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:29,314
Don't you want me
to be happy?

1776
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:32,529
Not sure I want that
for anybody.

1777
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:41,372
I'm going to miss
fucking you.

1778
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,666
I used to think
there was more,

1779
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,163
but there isn't.

1780
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:07,061
<i>One new message.</i>

1781
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:08,766
<i>Hi, this is Beverly</i>

1782
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,726
<i>confirming your date
for the night.</i>

1783
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:13,108
<i>Her name is Carla,
and she's a petite redhead.</i>

1784
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:14,905
<i>That is, the good redhead.</i>

1785
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:17,984
<i>Think Nicole Kidman,
not Howdy-Doody.</i>

1786
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:20,286
<i>Just so you know,
she has a lot of regulars.</i>

1787
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:36,103
Hey.

1788
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:39,941
You get my letter?

1789
01:44:39,982 --> 01:44:43,111
Letter? I got a FedEx
full of weed.

1790
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:44,616
Subtle.

1791
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:46,197
Want some salmon?

1792
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,123
I thought salmon
was for assholes.

1793
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:51,203
Everything else
had so much mercury.

1794
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:53,083
I drove 2 1/2 hours...

1795
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:55,335
and I ended up
back in my own apartment.

1796
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:57,291
Except I don't have the view.

1797
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,459
Me either.

1798
01:44:58,542 --> 01:44:59,509
They cut the tree down.

1799
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:01,462
Good for you.

1800
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:03,513
How was she?

1801
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:05,637
Wasn't worth a tree.

1802
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,093
You going to open
the wine?

1803
01:45:07,176 --> 01:45:08,393
You can have some.

1804
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:09,812
There's a glass in the...

1805
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:11,309
Oh, Jesus.

1806
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,311
Don't be so proud of yourself.

1807
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,518
You know like less
than 10% of the people

1808
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:17,319
who even take
the shit you're on

1809
01:45:17,394 --> 01:45:18,816
ever stay on it.

1810
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:20,856
I defer
to your drug expertise.

1811
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,568
Why did you fall in love with
her and ruin everything for me?

1812
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,619
I didn't fall
in love with her.

1813
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:26,991
That's worse.

1814
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:28,539
You ruined everything.

1815
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:30,537
No, you ruined everything!

1816
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:31,868
First of all,
I'm not in love with her,

1817
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:33,294
and I never was.

1818
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:34,529
But you slept
with her anyway?

1819
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:36,831
Why would you do that?

1820
01:45:36,872 --> 01:45:38,749
Okay, let's say
I understand that.

1821
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:39,880
But you don't.

1822
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:41,336
She helped me.

1823
01:45:41,377 --> 01:45:42,924
Let me feel
something again.

1824
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,005
So she makes me
stop getting high,

1825
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:46,432
but you get sex.

1826
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:48,851
What a shitty,
shitty deal.

1827
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,178
And for what?

1828
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:51,345
For this?

1829
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:52,645
What happened to you?

1830
01:45:52,721 --> 01:45:54,098
I am still me.

1831
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,525
Bullshit.
You're Ben lite.

1832
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,103
I'm Ben prime. I'm still the
same guy from sixth grade.

1833
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:00,859
No.

1834
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:05,822
Ben, you're a million miles
away from that kid

1835
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:06,948
I swear.

1836
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:08,700
This isn't bad.

1837
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:11,661
I'm just functioning now
like everyone else.

1838
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:16,878
So this is it?

1839
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:20,504
Well, maybe that's what's wrong
with the world.

1840
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:22,381
We keep looking
and grabbing

1841
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:23,711
and eating
and smoking

1842
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:25,467
and never stop to think.

1843
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,057
Who could want
more than this?

1844
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,402
You're here.

1845
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:46,074
That's all that matters.

1846
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:12,435
Hey, there.
Hi.

1847
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,980
I know.
It's a lot of junk.

1848
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,683
But I'm
a really good mother.

1849
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:44,625
Hey.
I'm sorry.

1850
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:48,968
I was going to leave
in the morning.

1851
01:47:49,046 --> 01:47:50,298
Well, I...

1852
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:54,347
What?

1853
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:58,480
You know anything
about running a farm?

1854
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:01,020
More than you.

1855
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:33,223
Come inside.

1856
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:34,174
No.

1857
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:05,088
Why are we here?

1858
01:49:05,164 --> 01:49:06,757
We're waiting
for the rain to stop.

1859
01:49:06,832 --> 01:49:08,926
Can I ride it?

1860
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:16,432
Could you?

1861
01:49:26,435 --> 01:49:27,436
Hey.

1862
01:49:29,271 --> 01:49:31,399
Um, Mom
said Wednesday.

1863
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,574
I don't know why
she said Wednesday.
