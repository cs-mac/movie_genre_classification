1
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,440 
What's up?
I'm Bruno.

2
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,520 
I am in Austrias coldest city,
Vienna ...

3
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520 
No big deal, what ever ...

4
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,000 
I'm the host of "Funky time" the most important
Tv Fashion show in any German speaking country.

5
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,760 
Apart from Germany.

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,840 
"Funky Time" is over influential.

7
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,840 
In fact the Austrians fashionistas live
there lives according to my in or out list.

8
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,480 
In Autism, out Chlamydia !!

9
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,000 
Why is Autism so cool at the moment?
Becaus it's funny.

10
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,000 
Right ...

11
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,800 
"Funky Time" has interviewed everyone
in the European fashion world..

12
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,080 
Can you look at the camera and say,
"You''re watching Funky time with Bruno."

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,240 
You are watching "Funky Time" program
with Bruno, and it's really a great show.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,800 
Can you do it like even more like a
black guy you know, more like an African.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,720 
Aah,like this...
Yeah - Yeah - Yeah ...

16
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,600 
Your are watching "Funky time with Bruno",
yo man, fuck man, welcome to the jungle.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,720 
Something maybe a bit more crazy,
maybe show a bit of skin or something?

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160 
No I don't think so.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,120 
What about just like one
cool rugsack, one of the balls?

20
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,240 
No ...

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,120 
I'm the most exiting and i'm visiting the town.
From the fashion streets of Milan

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,680 
Only for the German girls ...
my great hair.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,480 
Modeling, a lot of people think it's easy, but
it's the hardest job in the world, isn't it?

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,200 
It's very hard.

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160 
Standing on heels all day .

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,120 
And everyone is watching you...
So you have to make sure your walk is good.

27
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,200 
Yes it is really very hard to remember when to
bring your right leg forward and then your left ...

28
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,320 
and then again right, then left again ...
- Yes !

29
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,560 
And especially the turn it's..it's so scary.

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,960 
Being the hoost of "Funky time",
brings Bruno always seated on the front row.

31
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,000 
You put on some waight.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,400 
The kattle is calling the pot black.

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,920 
Hold your shoulders back, this is a
Fashion show, not a slide auction.

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,000 
My personal assistant, Koukos is my rock.

35
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,600 
He's also my stylist.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,840 
These glasses are to much ?
- Yeah i'll loos them.

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,400 
They are too much like... hey everybody
look at me, look at my glasses!

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,600 
Everybody likes to say "where are  my glasses"
He's also my nutritionist.

39
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,120 
I have a second assistant,

40
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,000 
but i can't remember his name.

41
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,040 
Bruno has known true love twice in his life.

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,920 
Once for 7 minutes, with Milly
of Milly and Vanilly.

43
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,200 
But for the last 9 years i was head over heals
in love with a flight attendant called Diesel.

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,600 
The jet pilot can operate in private you know.

45
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,880 
Boring stay at home time !!

46
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,240 
How much do you want?
Just fill the glasses.

47
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,240 
In September 2008 i went to
"Milan Fashion week"

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,600 
To shoot a new season of "Funky Time"

49
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,160 
Bruno had backstage access for
the hotest show of the week,

50
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,160 
"DE LA PRADA"

51
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,760 
So i wore the jewel of my wardrobe,
a suite made entirely out of Velcrot.

52
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,720 
I'm wearing this, this is a prototype
made by developer Frederique Vaoun.

53
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,560 
Serious i was looking at it, can i have one?

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160 
Sorry it's a prototype, it's for one hour.

55
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,160 
-Well now, listen ...
We have to finish the set.

56
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,480 
Get me out of this !

57
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,840 
Bruno opts out.

58
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,720 
For the second time in this century,
the world has turned on Austrias greatest man.

59
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,760 
Just because he was brave enough,
to try something new.

60
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,720 
* Bruno was blacklisted *
I GO TO THE FRONT ROW.... NO!!

61
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,920 
The first fall...

62
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,320 
I was Fired from "Funky Time.

63
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,640 
I realised that night that the fashion wold
was superficial and vacuous.

64
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,880 
I decided instead to go to Los Angeles,

65
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,480 
to become a celebrity.

66
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,120 
And i was going to bee the biggest
Austrian Superstar since Hitler.

67
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,760 
I'm not coming with you!! - Why not..?
Because you're out, you humiliate me.

68
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,000 
I'm so sorry i humilated you.
I've gotta go.

69
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,840 
Babber... i love you.

70
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,360 
Diesel I Love You !!... Diesel.

71
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,280 
I will roll with you.

72
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,840 
Who are you?

73
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,480 
I am Lutz.
Your assistant's assistant.

74
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720 
Let me come to
Los Angeles with you.

75
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,760 
I'll help you become famous.

76
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,240 
Why would I need your help;
you're totally unqualified?

77
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,800 
Because I think you're...
amazing.

78
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,960 
Will I wake up to you
masturbating over me?

79
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,720 
I promise,
I won't wake you up.

80
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,800 
Upon arrival in LA I had to
masked to avoid the paparazzi.

81
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,240 
My plan is to become the largest gay
film star after Schwarzenegger.

82
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,320 
So, I went to the first meeting with
Hollywood agents for actors.

83
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,280 
I'm Bruno, I was born in
Gklagkonfolu, I have 19 years in. ..

84
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,840 
Of course, you know me as the head of TV shows
"Funky Time".

85
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,000 
OK.

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,680 
I understand that, just look at the script for
"Jerry Mangkouair ...

87
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,600 
Try to see how you go

88
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,960 
Jerry enters ...
-Not, points since that says: Hello ...

89
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,560 
Hello .. Hello
I am looking for my wife!

90
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,960 
Shut up, woman!
This is improvisation.

91
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,280 
I could hear your
voice or laugh with you

92
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,480 
OK, stop.
Wait ...

93
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920 
Let you stop for two minutes.

94
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,000 
Stop here.

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,200 
Nowhere in the script does not say: it poses
some time. You're here because you want to play ...

96
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,080 
I want to be a star in
big Hollywood movie!

97
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,280 
Can you achieve this?
-No.

98
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,280 
Definitely no chance.

99
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,600 
But I managed to get a role in popular
TV series.

100
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,360 
As extras.

101
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,960 
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury ...

102
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000 
Defense as you know ...

103
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,400 
For more than 12 years ...

104
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,640 
Stop!

105
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,080 
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury ... Fear that
m not happy to speak tonight

106
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,600 
As you know the defense ...

107
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,880 
... I personally know the accused ...

108
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,640 
It is hard to know ...

109
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,960 
But personal debts by
forced to take bribes.

110
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,640 
Cut!

111
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,520 
As you know ...

112
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,240 
the accused was in a position in
more than 12 years

113
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,920 
during which we met several times

114
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,440 
It is hard to know ...
- Score! I have a feeling that something is amiss.

115
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,120 
Must be repeated.

116
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,920 
World stars you is at your fingertips.

117
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,560 
We are in L.A

118
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160 
You are actually my second choice

119
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,560 
I wanted to go to the same salon
where the wax goes Selma Hayek

120
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,960 
But those who booked for the
next 4 days.

121
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,160 
They say they are very exhausted every time
Selma work. - O God, and if so

122
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,880 
then it must have been a lot of hairy.

123
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,880 
They say that after it has enough to fill
quilt.

124
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,400 
When we are already at it, let's you clean!
- Will I hurt

125
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,760 
Not much.

126
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,920 
Phone ...

127
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920 
Hello?
-What are you doing mate?

128
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,680 
Here nothing?
-I just talked with the TV station.

129
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,720 
These are great news!

130
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,160 
For two days.

131
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,720 
Will odgledati and decide.

132
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,680 
Ogrebali save me Zlatan.

133
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,760 
I ...
While you have èistili.

134
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,120 
Whether this involves cleaning and my eggs?
- What?

135
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,360 
I told the woman in the salon.

136
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,360 
Izbjeljuje my anus. Is l 'a
a chance to see and deal?

137
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,920 
Yes, of course.
OK, I'll call Brenda to contract.

138
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,520 
If you could pull your fingers out
Zlatan my moment ...

139
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,360 
OK. I think we are finished. Once again ...
says that you remove your fingers from my anus.

140
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320 
This is a guy just said ...

141
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,480 
I do not speak to you already the woman here.

142
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,040 
Who has the audio recording?

143
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,600 
I want to listen to the recording.
I want to hear what all this idiot said.

144
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,960 
Let the image.

145
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,040 
I booked Paula Abdul
very soon after!

146
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,480 
How crazy!

147
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,920 
But where is the furniture?

148
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,800 
It's gone.

149
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,720 
I told them to move it out for today
because of the interview.

150
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,480 
Without furniture,
where will Paula sit?

151
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,960 
Are you trying to ruin me?

152
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,800 
Wait.

153
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,800 
Listen to me guys, if you want
earn a little money?

154
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,840 
Paula Abdul, a member of the jury in the U.S. idol
Hello, hello! How are you?

155
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,960 
I'm Bruno.
-Nice.

156
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,200 
We're glad you're here.
Here you go, sit on our furniture Majeed.

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,280 
You can sit freely.

159
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,240 
OK, tell me something about your humanitarian work?

160
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,640 
How old is important to help other people?
Of vital importance for my life.

161
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,800 
It is like the air we breathe ...

162
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,600 
and the water we drink.

163
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,080 
It is very important to me.
If you give love, love, and you will receive.

164
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,280 
It fills me and fills my life.

165
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,440 
You must ogladnila,
Come from asking a klopu ...

166
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,120 
Oh my God ...

167
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,760 
This is very bad for me.
Excuse me, I want to go.

168
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,520 
Out.

169
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,880 
Return to ...
Please return!

170
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,360 
Yes, I understand but ...

171
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,040 
Paula's Agent spread the word.
We've been blacklisted.

172
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,280 
What about...

173
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,600 
He won't come.

174
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,160 
Stevie?
-No.

175
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,800 
Will Smith?

176
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,680 
Adolf Hitler (Bratt Pitt);
-No.

177
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,360 
Fuhrer? (Mel Gibson)

178
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,840 
How can I make a show
without the celebrities?

179
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,600 
Don't worry... we have 24 hours,
the show will go on.

180
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,440 
PROBNA PUBLIKA
Next day

181
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,000 
This group is a representative sample
viewers would react to the show.

182
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,880 
I arranged an interview with Harrison Ford.

183
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,600 
OK! Great.
-I.

184
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,520 
As you know, today, evaluate new
tv show.

185
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,280 
Show with famous authors and
Head Brune.

186
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,320 
Hi, I'm Lloyd Robinson.
Lloyd ... Hello, I'm Denny Bond.

187
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,520 
Hi. Is told to you that day
when I went to the anus bleaching?

188
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,240 
It is very important to rate the show
because if it was assessed at 80% or more

189
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,960 
It would certainly be very interesting
and successful TV show.

190
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,640 
Who is ready to meet with
many stars?

191
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,880 
I am! Because this is "A - list of known"
with Bruno!

192
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600 
Hello, how are you?
- Good ... thanks for the invitation to your show.

193
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,080 
This is part of the show called,
"As the children."

194
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,200 
OK.

195
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,360 
OK, this is Britneyina sister ...
I can not remember how it called?

196
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,640 
James Lin.
James Lin exactly ...

197
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,720 
Is she a star?;
-No.

198
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,240 
OK, let's see what she wears in the stomach.

199
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480 
OK ... Do you think this is ugly fetus?

200
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,200 
Yes.

201
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,680 
Pay attention to hidden face of ...
as if the child is a star

202
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,040 
and in fact the child treæerazredne
liènost known.

203
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,640 
Am I right?
- More èetvrtorazredne known.

204
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,960 
Do you think your child is retarded?

205
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,920 
Definitely hands and ears, too
are not fully developed ...

206
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,240 
Probably because the child is not yet completely developed.

207
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,280 
What about him? To keep him or
abortion?

208
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,600 
Abortion.

209
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,520 
Now an exclusive interview with
Harrison Ford

210
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,760 
only seconds away
Until then uvajte with Bruno to dance!

211
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,640 
And now what you waiting. I, a
one in an exclusive interview

212
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,120 
With Harrison Ford!

213
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,360 
Fuck off!

214
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,920 
This is mine.

215
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,280 
This was at the end of Lloyd's idea.

216
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,880 
At the end of ...
was ...

217
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,240 
To describe the show in a "lights out?

218
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,360 
Will someone describe it?

219
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,640 
This is the biggest bunch of crap that
I've ever seen.

220
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,920 
It is always wonderful when nağe one which
do not like ...

221
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,240 
Drop a fun and funny.

222
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,640 
What kind of sick viewer
would like to see this?

223
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,080 
Yes, it is always two, always.

224
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,800 
I wanted to pull out his own eyes needles.
- These pins should borrow from me.

225
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,040 
Can I go to them to explain to them?
No, not you.

226
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,560 
I want them odvuèem
attention. Kiss Me! -No.

227
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,760 
Neither reasonable person would think
of such a program

228
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,120 
If there is no moral or any
deeper meaning.

229
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400 
Oh God.

230
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,840 
Manager is an idiot with no talent.

231
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,320 
L 'idot no one knows talent
dance like this?

232
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,160 
I would say that he knows.

233
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,880 
Do not go ...
This is my career

234
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,160 
I've invested all your money
in her ... please ...

235
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720 
"It was worse than cancer"

236
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,920 
I do not want your show ...

237
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,320 
They don't want it.

238
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,960 
I don't know, how you
still put up with me.

239
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,920 
I'm nothing.
I should go back to Austria.

240
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,280 
No... you're amazing.

241
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,760 
Lutz, here's a good one.
I have to make a porn.

242
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,440 
Ron Paul, predjsjednièki candidate in 2008
I'm here with Congressman Ron Paul

243
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640 
Who in 2008 was a candidate for
President

244
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,920 
Tell me, What clothes wear?

245
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,560 
Frankly I'm not sure.
Oblaèim formally in accordance with the job ...

246
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,280 
Hang on a minute, a reflector
is blown.

247
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,760 
Um, relax in another room
remedy the defect while?

248
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,000 
Of course.

249
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,280 
Would you like champagne?
-No thanks, not now.

250
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,880 
No containers with ice but I know where
still can be pushes ... haha

251
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,440 
You were great.
Have you had many times on TV?

252
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,440 
Yes, especially last year.

253
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,800 
Do you want a couple of strawberries?
-It 's okay.

254
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,480 
I burn candles if you do not
against.

255
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,440 
To relax a little

256
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,760 
and if you told someone that reminds the
Julio Iglesias?

257
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,600 
Of course not,
You are much slaği.

258
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,120 
I love music ...
I dance.

259
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,280 
Get out of here!

260
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,560 
That's it, almost.

261
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,120 
This guy is a freak pederko,

262
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,520 
It is not normal.
Went to download ...

263
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,080 
Failed to Moss or Ron Paul ...
How do I then become famous?

264
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,720 
I decided to seek advice from
najmudrijeg character whom I know

265
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,160 
GARRY WILLIAMS, medium. I want to talk
Milija the group Milli Vanilli.

266
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,520 
Is in Heaven, and if so
I was in the VIP part of paradise?

267
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,040 
Says that the site is surrounded by trees
and flowers

268
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,640 
Can I ask whether
any advice for me?

269
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,360 
He says he will take care of something,
as a foundation or something.

270
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,680 
Something that would include other people ...

271
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,760 
This is a good idea. So if you do
so ...

272
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,720 
I'll definitely become known around the world.

273
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,200 
That's right.

274
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,840 
Can I do something that
Lucky it did?

275
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,320 
Can I kiss him?
-Of course.

276
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,920 
Lots of luck with your life.

277
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,000 
Thanks Milija see clearly now ...

278
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,880 
Charity work is the best way
to become famous!

279
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,480 
So Bruno has to find a great
tragedy that will be corrected.

280
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,640 
NICOLLA I SUZZANE DEFOSSET,
charity PR consultants

281
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,240 
Looking for something that does not require much
effort and without doing much.

282
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,680 
Something that would put me on the "A list"?

283
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,800 
Is there something in what you believe, like ...

284
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,160 
Something current.

285
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,120 
Global warming,
situation is only getting worse ...

286
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,280 
Excellent

287
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,360 
This problem is crucial for our
future

288
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,000 
But it is solvable in the long run,
currently not easy.

289
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,760 
And say something that would activate ...
say Africa?

290
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,320 
OK.
Something like a rescue or animal?

291
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,160 
No.
Hm ... maybe the elephants?

292
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,280 
Making the bracelet ... -Making
Bracelet of istrebljenih animals.

293
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,160 
Hmm, I think that it would not just
succeed as you intended.

294
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,200 
What is a cool guy humanitarian work?
-Rat. Toènije peace and prevention of war.

295
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,000 
Whether somewhere in the world
a place where no

296
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,200 
celebrities is not one
said "stop the war"?

297
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,520 
What's new place?
Someone that no one has ever done that?

298
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,120 
I'll become so famous that I resolve
world problem. But who?

299
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,520 
Cloneey took Darfur ...

300
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,880 
Sting Amazon

301
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,400 
A Bono took AIDS.

302
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,760 
Fortunately, the other one pripizdina
to solve.

303
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,320 
Middle East.

304
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,520 
My plan is to urge both sides to
sign of peace.

305
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,040 
What Bruno did the super famous.

306
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,360 
I guess I have your hat.

307
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,160 
Why are you so against Hamas?

308
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,280 
Do not you have serious enemies
from those of the same sex who love?

309
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,080 
I believe you are mixed and Hamas
homose ...

310
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,160 
I mean that there is a connection
between Hamas and homiæa?

311
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,280 
And those who founded Hamas ...

312
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,360 
Their boss, did not have much
male followers ...

313
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,000 
No, homiæi have nothing to do with Hamas.

314
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,200 
It is about food, you understand?

315
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,720 
We should, they should be ...

316
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,720 
Vegetarian ...
beans.

317
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,040 
So both of you agree with that?

318
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,680 
To agree.

319
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,160 
So we achieve progress.

320
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,560 
Let's try to find
solution, OK?

321
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,680 
I'm not gonna be here forever.

322
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,920 
Do you agree more Palestinians to return
Pyramid of Israel?

323
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,400 
This is Egypt, not Palestine.

324
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,480 
I do not care where you put them
just return them.

325
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,200 
Here the object is for the benefit of
people ...

326
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,200 
Either because they believed in it, convinced
are that it is properly

327
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,040 
OK, slowly Curo.
If you can not convince myself to sign the peace

328
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,240 
I hardly become known.

329
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,480 
So I decided to try
differently access.

330
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,000 
A friend told me it would help us
to achieve peace.

331
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,760 
I know that will come to that.

332
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,080 
"I wrote the song because when
No hope ...

333
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,280 
it will keep you together.

334
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,560 
And when the end came to the world,

335
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,240 
Jews and Hindus You'll be
together

336
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,760 
Creating love is my mission

337
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,440 
Finally, we are all Christians "

338
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,920 
We have other options.

339
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,880 
There was no progress and I did not have enough
ecstasy for all.

340
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,000 
I was ready to give up

341
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,240 
But I thought things iznenda
who told

342
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,280 
In recent years, people have been kidnapped.

343
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,400 
I play the recording, which
visited the whole world.

344
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,160 
The whole world?
-Yes.

345
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,640 
So the whole world saw their video
while they were hostages ...

346
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,680 
I'll become known as the
I'll be kidnapped.

347
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,040 
I'll tell you something that will so
angry ...

348
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,320 
Yes you will if you have the right rivet gun
same with me and shoot me in the head.

349
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,800 
Ready?
-Yes.

350
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:32,200 
Your hair is too many corners are bent.

351
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,120 
Your head's corners are bent from the sun ...
To be honest, I want to be famous.

352
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,720 
I want to be the best in the industry
snatch.

353
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,200 
Al Qaeda is so 2,001th
-I do not like this.

354
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,360 
Can you give some advice?

355
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,640 
Lose the war. This is because your king Osama

356
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,720 
Looks like a nasty wizard

357
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,960 
or grandfather boiænjak beskuænik.

358
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,000 
Out, out now!

359
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,960 
It took courage to
naustimo Middle East.

360
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,160 
But Bruno had a new plan

361
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,760 
Which implies svraæanje in Africa
for a short shopping.

362
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,600 
Loutz, this is ours.

363
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,880 
And this

364
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,600 
Loutz, here it is ...

365
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,120 
Be careful...

366
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,040 
Madonna has one.

367
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,720 
Brangelina has one.

368
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,240 
And now
Brüno also has one!

369
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,400 
That is 13 pounds of black gold.

370
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,040 
Call all of the magazines.

371
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,440 
We're organizing the best photo
shoot the world has ever known.

372
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,120 
It will make me so famous.
Understood?

373
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,080 
Yes, I understand.

374
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,480 
My African mal would bring me
on the cover of newspapers.

375
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,400 
And so ... I hired
Best Cinematography

376
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,440 
and organized for the best movie trailer
photography ever.

377
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,320 
We'll make something religious, where my
baby was on the cross for example ...

378
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,520 
Will represent Jesus, even though my
baby black ...

379
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,680 
But this is just cool ...
-Yes, it's cool.

380
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,240 
As Madonna's spot ...
-Yes, something like that. What you do not ...

381
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,800 
We need two kid who will be
on the cross next to my baby.

382
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,440 
I agree to have your child say
nağe on the cross next to my baby?

383
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,440 
Yes, no problem. We have nothing
against the cross.

384
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,680 
Would your child be OK in the vicinity
bees, wasp or hornet?

385
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,640 
George is OK with everything, no sweat.

386
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,440 
Is it OK to close the dead or
umiruæih animals?

387
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,280 
Yes.

388
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,920 
Submitted to the extreme reduction of acceleration?
-Yes.

389
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,760 
Must there always be a seat for babies
or is free to sit in the car?

390
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,240 
Yes, no problem. Anyway,
was in the seat or free ...

391
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,440 
Sure, it looks better without a seat.
"Certainly, of course.

392
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,640 
Traffic is fast but it will not kill you.

393
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,680 
Of course, of course.

394
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,880 
Is it OK for your child to be near
heavy machinery?

395
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,720 
Yes, I already was in the vicinity thereof.

396
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,760 
Is it OK to shake hands with them?

397
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,680 
Yes.

398
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,640 
Perfect.

399
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,000 
In the end, is OK with phosphoric lights?

400
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,720 
Yes.
-Great.

401
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,160 
I like him?
-He loves them.

402
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,160 
How hard?
-There are about 15 kg.

403
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,720 
15 kilos ...
Say.

404
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,360 
Can you lose weight stance to 5 pounds
until next week?

405
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,880 
Next week, 7 days?

406
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,240 
Yes, I'll work hard to succeed.

407
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,880 
Are you willing to undergo the
program for weight loss?

408
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,200 
If necessary and if you will lose weight
then yes, no problem.

409
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,880 
Great! We chose your child will be
trained as a Nazi officer

410
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,040 
Gurajuæui other carts with baby
which would represent the Jews ...

411
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,960 
The stove ...
-U plate?

412
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,120 
Congratulations!
How you feeling?

413
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,880 
Excellent, if you got a job ...

414
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,320 
Yes.
-Great.

415
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,960 
Bruno ... I spoke with the head
a "talk show" a Dallas

416
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,240 
Great!

417
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,160 
OJ, you're gonna be on television.

418
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,200 
Loutz, but not
total ° MatijinaPrinceza °.

419
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,560 
Thank you, thank you

420
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480 
Welcome back to "Today" with.
Richard Bayom.

421
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,200 
Next customer is a sole parent.

422
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,440 
Please welcome Bruno!

423
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,080 
Where did you come?

424
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,920 
I come from Austria.
-Austria ...

425
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,120 
What is your impression of Americans?
Must have seen them a lot here.

426
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,400 
I must say that I love U.S.
I love people and African-Americans.

427
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,440 
You're a single parent?
-Yes.

428
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,320 
Most people believe that a child should
have two parents.

429
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,000 
It is very difficult to raise a child without help
the other parent. Am I right?

430
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,840 
Am I right?

431
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,480 
I'm scared not to do something wrong.
Am I right?

432
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,080 
I hope you'll find a "true gentleman".
Am I right?

433
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,720 
Just jealous that you can have
any type here!

434
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,480 
Can we see your son?

435
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,360 
Of course.

436
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,720 
Where did this to you baby?
L 'to a child heterosexual parents?

437
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,320 
I was in the Middle East to address the
a crisis, but it's not important now ...

438
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,240 
When I went back to the United States dropped
I am in a country called Africa

439
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,440 
OK?
-Africa is not a state? Africa is a continent ...

440
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200 
It was full of African-Americans.
-It was full of Africans ...

441
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,080 
These are people from Africa.
-No, this is a very racist say.

442
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,160 
It is correct to say African-Americans.

443
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,800 
OK, how do you find your son?

444
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,680 
I got it in return.

445
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,040 
Replace ... what kind of replacement?

446
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,680 
In exchange for what?

447
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720 
In exchange for the Ipod.

448
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,840 
What?

449
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,080 
It was not any iPod. Restricted
Series U2, red and in good condition.

450
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,720 
Hang on a second ... You are now
father of the baby and put it to you?

451
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,480 
What it says on the mother?
- Gay Baby.

452
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920 
It is not his name, right?

453
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,200 
No, I gave him the traditional
African name.

454
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,040 
Well, that is called a baby?
- The J

455
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,600 
Do you think your child is a thing?

456
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,520 
Yes because it is black that it can
you use as a fashion accessory,

457
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,440 
Do it like a dog in the park šeæeš

458
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,320 
barys and people ...
or something. What do you think about it?

459
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,400 
I must admit, is a small real
magnet for dick.

460
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,360 
You took some photos
with the baby ...

461
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,440 
Likely pursued
how much you love this child ...

462
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,000 
To see the next picture.

463
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,640 
Do we have another picture or this
was the last?

464
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,360 
What is going on here?

465
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,400 
If I have fun and your child will be
have fun with me, I sebièan.

466
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,240 
Just afraid of the truth!

467
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,760 
I do not see any way to think

468
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760 
get out from here with this child
in the hands of

469
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,800 
and to have someone stop and take you
this child?

470
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,160 
OK, as you know the program has
its final ...

471
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,760 
Please want to welcome Santana
Megkans from the Department for Child Protection.

472
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:05,240 
What is the legal opinion of the state
on this issue.

473
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,480 
What's good for the health of children and
generally for a child anyway?

474
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,800 
This child is here illegally.

475
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,880 
This is not true.

476
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,400 
I made a deal with her mother.

477
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,600 
And this time we take a child under
our protection.

478
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,120 
Give me my baby!
Come back to me baby!

479
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,000 
Je l 'to your son?
Is beautiful.

480
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,440 
He was my son before
were taken from me.

481
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,920 
So sorry ...
God.

482
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,040 
What's all of this?

483
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,680 
OJ is gone.

484
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,440 
I'm committing carbicide.

485
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,800 
You have everything
to live for.

486
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,200 
I am so tired.
I can't walk back.

487
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,960 
Lutz, you're so strong.
And you're just as comfy as a Mexican.

488
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,720 
You're so light, Mr. Brüno.

489
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,160 
Just like a feather.

490
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,000 
You know, I'm only nice to you,
because I like you.

491
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,240 
Mr. Brüno, your hairbrush is
pressing into my back.

492
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,160 
That's not my hairbrush.

493
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,080 
Where is the key?

494
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,960 
Call for help.

495
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,440 
Hello, sorry for the situation
in room

496
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,600 
But I assure you that the bathroom
impeccably clean.

497
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,680 
Can you find the key?
I think that there

498
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,000 
I'll just second.

499
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,440 
Brian, can you come now?

500
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,560 
Two types are cuffed one
the other in bed.

501
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,360 
The room has a bicycle with a lengthening
èijem at the end dlido ...

502
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,720 
The room is in chaos,
I'm going to see whether they can find a key.

503
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,080 
Currently I am very fucking
anxious.

504
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,840 
If you could find a key
that can arise.

505
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,560 
See there ...

506
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,480 
What is going on here?
To tell me that ...

507
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,680 
You can switch off the first tv?
I accidentally prdnio not want this movie.

508
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,320 
I'm sorry about that, but ...

509
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,080 
I refuse to pay. Why would anyone
want to watch this movie?

510
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,800 
I'm scared that you can not do it

511
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,560 
If you could ...
Hey, how's your name?

512
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,120 
Podsjeæaš me one
Latino porn star.

513
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,400 
God Hates Gay
group of homosexual activists against

514
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,000 
Excuse me, can you unlock us?
Please ...

515
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,440 
What is going on here?

516
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,040 
So what can you look?

517
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,480 
That was the best day
of my life.

518
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,120 
It was super, fantastic.

519
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,120 
Finally, we are together.

520
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,160 
Are you retarded, Lutz?

521
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,320 
Last night I was
"carbohydrate-tripped" up.

522
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,920 
I had no idea, I didn't
know what I was doing.

523
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,680 
I was high on
Ragin' Cajun Potato Skins.

524
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,040 
I am Brüno.

525
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,040 
I don't date near nothing-assistants.

526
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,520 
Nobody loves as much as I love you...

527
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,640 
And I know, that you love me too.

528
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,200 
Please accept me.
Or die alone.

529
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,680 
No.

530
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,640 
Where can you go Lutz?

531
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,840 
If you leave me,
I'll not give you one cent.

532
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,520 
You can't do that anyways.
You're broke.

533
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,440 
I don't need you anyway, Lutz.

534
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,320 
I can do well by myself.

535
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,040 
I am Brüno!

536
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,720 
It should happen at a low point.

537
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,440 
Lutz left ...

538
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,280 
I was about to give up my dream of
celebrity.

539
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,120 
And suddenly it hit me.

540
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,280 
All the most famous stars in the
world,..

541
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,520 
Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kevin Spacy the ...

542
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,240 
They all have one thing in commmon,..

543
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,720 
They were all straight.

544
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,440 
To become famous I have to quit guys.

545
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,880 
I just needed to find a
cockaholics anonymous.

546
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,400 
Things have got to change.

547
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,080 
I've thought of becoming straight.

548
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,640 
One time straight,
can I still play the clarinet?

549
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,960 
If it doesn't remind you about some of
the behavior that you're engaged in

550
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,480 
when you put your lips around it.

551
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,680 
If it doesn't remind you of that, go for it
play the clarinet with everything inside you.

552
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,160 
If it does remind you of that, i say put
it down, give it away, let a friend hold it.

553
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,560 
Until you know in your mind you're ready to pick
it up again and it wouldend remind you of that.

554
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,680 
What if i put a flute up my stinker?

555
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,680 
I wouldn't do that because it would remind
you of your former lifestyle.

556
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,720 
So you don't put any flutes or instuments
up your ass? - Absolutely not !

557
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,360 
-You know why?
-Why?

558
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,920 
So you don't put any flutes or instuments
up your ass? - Absolutely not !

559
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,200 
Well, that would be bad.

560
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,520 
Is there any music that I shouldn't
listen to, any bands?

561
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,800 
Sinead O'Connor,The Indigo girls,..

562
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,600 
O course the Village People.

563
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,920 
Then i become stait?

564
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,360 
Any new hobby's that i should pick up.

565
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,560 
Do you enjoy hiking?

566
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,920 
Or lifting weights? - Sure !!

567
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,880 
There is nothing like working out,
and lifting weights,

568
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:51,480 
and buiding your muscles around some
other man that are not gay.

569
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,360 
I am totaly irresistible to gay guys.

570
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,200 
They see me and they want to stuff me.

571
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,960 
- OK.
- So how do i protect against those guys.

572
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,880 
If they get close to you hit them,
and leave the situation.

573
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,280 
How do you spot a homosexual?

574
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,520 
It's very hard to do, most of them
dress no different than me and you.

575
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,800 
Myself, - It's kind of like..

576
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:27,760 
Terrorists,
if they dress like the police

577
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120 
how would you know it's him?

578
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,240 
For the obvious things you
should look for.

579
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,120 
So if someone approaches you on
the street and is very nice to you,

580
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,800 
you know they are homosexual.
- Most likely...

581
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,760 
How should i protect myself from
being attacked bij Homosexuals?

582
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,880 
They probebly would attack from behind.

583
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,240 
Again if i'm a homosexual and i'm just
trying to run in and kiss you?

584
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,280 
Boom !!
He moved in at a wrong range.

585
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,680 
Let's say a homosexual has got you
on the ground.

586
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,200 
What if a homosexual get you down here?

587
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:17,160 
Go to pool this down, i will block this
and will hit with the elbow.

588
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,040 
How can you protect yourself from a dildo?

589
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,160 
Lets say i'm trying...

590
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,120 
Like this.

591
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,080 
And disarms the dildo?
- Yes.

592
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,160 
Is it harder to defend
against a black dildo?

593
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,200 
No, it's just as easy to defend against.

594
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,680 
So i'm attacking !!!

595
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,800 
Trap it, work the knees and elbow...

596
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,240 
How do you defend yourself from a
man with two dildo's? - Here Boom!

597
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,880 
And if he's running with his pants down?
- Here BOOM !!... break an arm.

598
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,840 
Thank you.
It was fantastic.

599
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,920 
It's very usefull. - It's very different
than what i have ever worked with.

600
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,400 
So you were never gay?

601
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,760 
It's ironic because you have
amazing blowjob lips.

602
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,840 
These lips were made to praise the lord.

603
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,640 
No they are made for something else
but you're not using them for that.

604
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,320 
Are there any activities you suggest were
i'm surrounded just by straight guys?

605
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,960 
Hurry up, get in here.
What? .... - Make this bed!!

606
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,520 
Hurry up !!...  Make the bed.

607
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,920 
But do you have something maybe a double ...
-Make the bed!!!

608
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,240 
-Would you hold the sheet over there?
No, you will need that, Get Down ...

609
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,240 
-What?
-I said get down ... and do push ups.

610
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,400 
This line around here is
the line you don't cross .

611
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,560 
By the way, where is your uniform ?
Go get your uniform on.

612
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,800 
Do it.

613
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,120 
Oh God.

614
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,840 
What's up with the scarf?

615
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,920 
This is like my own ...
Let me intoduce you to someone.

616
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,960 
What are you doing?

617
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,960 
Stand to position of attention soldier!
-Do it !

618
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,800 
Stand still soldier.

619
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,400 
That is not part of the uniform ...
You need to take that of !

620
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:07,560 
This outfit is to machy machy as it is
and i added some horizontal lines.

621
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,520 
Do you have an attitude candidate?

622
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,040 
Get down candidate!
Do it!

623
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,600 
What type of belt is that candidate?

624
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,080 
What is that?
- D & G

625
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,120 
-What is D &G ?
DOLCE & GABBANA... Hallo!

626
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,880 
Do it with your right hand.

627
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,800 
That's not good.

628
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,440 
Can I tell you about the person that changed
my life? - Of course that's Carl Lagerfelt.

629
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,760 
No actually his name is Jezus.

630
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,160 
Jesus is in this room right now.

631
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,880 
He never leaves us,
he never forsake us,  ...

632
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,160 
-He's here ...
-Amazing.

633
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,160 
That's exactly right,
is amazing.

634
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,840 
You want to be famous?
You'll be one that's so famous!

635
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,360 
You will prepare the way for other
young men

636
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,120 
all over the world who want to come
out of the homosexual lifestyle.

637
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,440 
And to make a change in their lives.

638
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,840 
And they say, if Bruno
can do it I can do it.

639
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,520 
How did you change Bruno?
And you say.. it's Jezus.

640
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,920 
He has changed me.
But he wants to come in to your heart right now.

641
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,440 
Are you ready to make that change?

642
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,400 
Are you hitting on me?

643
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,000 
No, i'm not.

644
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,920 
Because that was realy hard,
that whole stage.

645
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,640 
Are there any outdoor activities that
I should do if I want to become straight?

646
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,800 
Absolutely.

647
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,880 
-Hi.
-Hi.

648
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,160 
Heve you ever been hunting?

649
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,360 
I have never killed an animal, apart from
a hamster that i  suffocated in Mykonos.

650
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,160 
Do you prefer the vagina or
the manly hands? ....

651
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,320 
-I prefer the vagina.
-Me too.

652
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,640 
I love a women with a vagina.

653
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,240 
Yeah ...

654
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,160 
My favorite.

655
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,800 
We were just talking about vaginas.

656
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,360 
About what?

657
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,760 
Vagina's  ...
The woman's vagina ...

658
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,880 
-What you wear is not much fantasizing
Oooh Yes ...

659
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,320 
-Really?
-Fantasy.

660
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,560 
Realy wonderful fabric.

661
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,200 
It is my favorite.

662
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,960 
Look at the 4 of us ...
We are so like the Sex and the City girls.

663
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,640 
Which one are you Danny?

664
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,200 
I ain't one of them.
I am Danny.

665
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,760 
That is such a Samantha thing to say.

666
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,440 
I've never been out of the city before .

667
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,400 
And...    how does it feel?

668
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,920 
I feel a bit vulnerable.

669
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,240 
You know I am 19 years old,
i've got a perfect body ...

670
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,600 
I don't wanna wake up tomorrow
morning and find out...

671
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,000 
that i'm taunt in my ass A-pillar.

672
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,280 
You probably aint going or what....
- But you just ditched us.

673
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840 
There are so many stars in the sky.

674
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,400 
Makes you think of all the
hot guys in the world.

675
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,360 
Mike?

676
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,640 
-Yes.
It's me... Bruno.

677
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,080 
- There is a homosexual.
-What?

678
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,600 
I think we'll both be safe
if i sleep with you here tonight.

679
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,560 
I don't give a god damn, get to
your fucking tent and leave me alone.

680
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,920 
Okay goodnight.

681
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,120 
Sweet dreams.

682
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,560 
Can I come in?

683
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,640 
It's just this bear undoing my clothes.
He could get interest in pats of me

684
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,040 
Get the fuck out of here.

685
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:12,240 
Reverend Pitzei found me to much of a hand full,
and put me in touch with one of his chumps .

686
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,360 
You look descent in that.

687
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,920 
You look like a straight guy,
how's that?

688
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,800 
Women are good for us.

689
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,280 
They're  good, even though....

690
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,560 
they appear to us to be
terribly conventional.

691
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,040 
And we find that some what irritating

692
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,960 
That they complain so much.

693
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,800 
Right.

694
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,880 
But the need that...

695
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:47,760 
We need many of the things,
that at first glance are ...

696
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,800 
annoying and irritating...

697
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,120 
and women often don't stick to the point.

698
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,400 
They are often talking about one thing,
and then another and another ...

699
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,840 
and they never get back to the first point...

700
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,120 
maybe ever.

701
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,040 
I'm repulsed by the idea of making
the sex with a woman.

702
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:19,360 
The important thing is to be around
women, some what that you find...

703
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,880 
tolerable or interesting ...

704
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,120 
And give them a chance
to seduce you.

705
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,040 
"Swingers Party"

706
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,360 
I hardly do get them first?

707
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:40,200 
Of all nights for us to swing
was the night of our honeymoon.

708
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,800 
And what is your favorite position?

709
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,440 
That would be missionary or
reverse cowgirl.

710
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,800 
What is "reverse cowgirl" ?

711
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,320 
Show me,  I pretent as a woman .

712
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,720 
Like i'm  sitting here ...

713
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,480 
- And you'll be sitting like that ...
Right.

714
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,120 
- That's called reverse cowgirl .
Right.

715
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,920 
And then when you're faceing me
that's  called cowgirl.

716
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,800 
This one is cowgirl or reverse cowgirl ?

717
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000 
This is cowgirl, and then when you turn
the opposite way, it's reverse cowgirl.

718
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,280 
And what other positions are there?

719
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,800 
Car driver ...

720
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:25,040 
-  69 - This is the girls position, you don't
wanna be like this for ever.

721
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,280 
There is missionary, doggy style ...

722
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,400 
What's doggy style like?

723
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,040 
You'll be bent over like a dog does it ...

724
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,560 
-Like that? -Yes.
-And then what will you be doing?

725
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,280 
If you was a woman i'd be happy.
- Show me !

726
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:48,200 
I would be humping you like that ...
-I can't wait to do this to a women.

727
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,520 
Anybody wants a sandwich ?

728
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,000 
Right ...

729
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,720 
Good boy ...

730
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,800 
Ohh.. fuck yeah.....
- You're doing a nice job.

731
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,920 
Come on, try to look at my eyes ...

732
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,280 
Look me in the eyes,
you can do that.

733
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,000 
Why would he look you in the eyes
when he is likking our pussy??

734
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:50,840 
Just for concentration.
- He does not like other guys.....

735
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,280 
This is a swingers party !!

736
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,240 
You don't want pussy if you don't want fucking ?
Than quit touching me and quit looking at me.

737
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,160 
I didn't come here for no fucking queer show.
- Me neither.

738
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,960 
-O.K. lets keep it at that then.

739
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,800 
This is a fucking swingers party,
right guys?

740
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,320 
Hi ...
Come with me.

741
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,560 
I was just going to the kitchen
-Ohh, yea, yea...

742
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,880 
Let's maybe forget we know each other,
I thing it's broken !! ...

743
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,080 
Let's get to know each other
a little bit first ...

744
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,280 
-What?
-You must seduce a lot of men.

745
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,720 
I don't want you to do
something that you will regret..

746
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,160 
you wake up tomorrow and you've lost
your virginity and you feel ashamed.

747
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,160 
You know,
let's take this a little slower ...

748
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,400 
Sit the fuck down.
SIT THE FUCK DOWN !!

749
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,400 
Don't fuck around !!
No,.. Let's do this the right way,

750
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,640 
I sit down with your father, we talk
about this, and he gives his permition.

751
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,400 
You could be a little bitch here and take
your clothes of, or I rip them

752
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,400 
Yeah ...

753
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,200 
Thanks. - We are going to make
this heterosexual sex good.

754
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,160 
Do as I say !! ....

755
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,400 
take that fucking shit of now ...

756
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,920 
Take it off...

757
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:30,880 
I've got an idea...

758
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,040 
try a little bit of dress up here,
it will be erotic

759
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,480 
What is this?
You want to dress me like a man?

760
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,480 
No it's just a beard.

761
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,320 
- You want me to wear the beard?
Come on it will be fun...

762
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:44,040 
I don't need a beard ...
Take it of now.

763
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,920 
Get on your fucking knees and
suck my spike here bitch.

764
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,560 
I'm gonna be the straightest man
who's ever lived.

765
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,160 
And  then I will be famous...
You'll see, you'll see.

766
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,120 
- 8 MONTHS LATER -
Want to see some ass kicking tonight?

767
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,840 
Make some noise,
put your hands together for...

768
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:57,040 
the host of a brand new Tv show
"Straight  Gays"

769
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,080 
Are you ready for some
man slamming action?

770
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,000 
Who's ready for an old fashion hetro fest?

771
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:39,640 
Are you 100% hetro, like me?

772
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,760 
I want to hear you say,
"Straight pride"

773
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,600 
You know why?
Because my asshole is just for shitting.

774
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,880 
It's great to have an evening
with straight  people.

775
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,800 
It's great not to have any fags here.

776
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,520

780
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,200 
The footage went everywhere.

781
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,280 
And Bruno became "Uber" famous .

782
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,480 
As for Loutz ...
We decided to get married in California.

783
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,000 
But because of the law,
we had to be a bit inventive .

784
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,600 
I feel this is the biggest step you'll ,
ever make in your life now.

785
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:47,640 
That's right.

786
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,000 
Am I gonna be able to meet her,
before we actually start?

787
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,240 
Sure.

788
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,920 
I don't marry two men or
two women.

789
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,400 
If she's a man,
how did she gave birth to our son?

790
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,200 
You gave birth to a little black child ?

791
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:17,600 
Yes.

792
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,560 
When did you had the baby?

793
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,800 
I don't even know why i'm asking that.

794
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,720 
But even though
the marriage was a nish nish,

795
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,160 
we weren't gonna let it get us down.

796
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,080 
We were happy.
We had each other and we had OJ back.

797
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:45,640 
I was so famous that I was able
to record my very own Charity Video.

798
01:12:54,120 --> 01:13:00,720 
I wrote a song that i hope
is gonna bring the world together.

799
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,640 
Put down your guns and bombs,

800
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:13,120 
and just make love forever.

801
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,520 
He's come to heal the world....

802
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,200 
and make all nations calmer

803
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,600 
I am the Austrian Jesus,

804
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,280 
He is the white Obama.

805
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,480 
War is based on hate and fear...

806
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,920 
stop fighting North and South Korea.

807
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,920 
You're really both Chinese.

808
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,200 
It's Bruno the dove of peace.

809
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,240 
Hey Bruno were are the bitches?

810
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,800 
It's Bruno the dove of peace.

811
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,880 
I had a dream for the 3rd World.

812
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:29,200 
clean water, food and teaching.

813
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,840 
In every village and every town...

814
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,320 
a place for anal bleaching .

815
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,440 
We need to free the world of hunger ...

816
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,800 
I am like Bono but so much younger.

817
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,360 
Hey's only 19 ...

818
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,480

819
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,240 
Hey, hey... he's gay, he's gay ...
