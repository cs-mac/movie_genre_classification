1
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,996
Tomás.

2
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,231
A big fellow,
riding that Appaloosa stud out there,

3
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,276
he came in here a little while ago?

4
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,909
He in the washroom.
He shaves, he cleans up.

5
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,752
Thanks.

6
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,235
Hi, Cole.

7
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,548
That's a voice l'd know anywhere.

8
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,191
J P Harrah. Wait till l get
some of the soap out of my eyes.

9
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,236
l heard you were made sheriff...

10
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,873
- What's the idea of the gun?
- l don't know which side you're on.

11
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,111
- What do you mean?
- l heard you work for Bart Jason.

12
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,159
Nothing's set yet.

13
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,153
He offered me good money,
but l don't know what l have to do.

14
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,676
- Would you like to hear?
- Yeah, go ahead.

15
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,718
Cole,
that's close enough to that gun.

16
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,554
l just wanted to see
if you'd slowed down any.

17
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,029
Not that much.

18
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,429
What were you saying about Jason?

19
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,399
He showed up here around the end
of the war with a pocketful of money.

20
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,755
Nobody can find out where he got it,

21
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,354
but everybody else
around here was broke.

22
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,398
- You know how it was.
- Yeah, all over Texas.

23
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,473
Having money, he started to grow.
But now he needs more water.

24
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,596
There's only one place to get it.

25
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,389
Trouble is, somebody was there
ahead of him. About 20 years ahead.

26
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,436
A man named MacDonald got here

27
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,556
when there was nothing
but lndians and coyotes.

28
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,235
Mr MacDonald's got four boys
and a girl, all worked real hard.

29
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,915
They hung together through the rough
times, and now things are looking up,

30
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,594
MacDonald's in no mind to sell.

31
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,798
So he's holding and Jason's pushing,
and l'm standing right in the middle.

32
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,519
lt's not the way it was told to me.

33
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,559
That's the way it is. l guess
you're supposed to take care of me.

34
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,716
Not that l couldn't do it, Harrah,
but l don't think l'd like that.

35
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,115
l'm glad to hear you say that.

36
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,317
Not that l couldn't handle you,
but l wouldn't like that either.

37
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,389
Suppose l tell that Jason that
l had a long talk with you,

38
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,869
and you scared me off.

39
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,190
- Good enough?
- Good enough.

40
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,357
You can put that thing down now.

41
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,238
Something familiar about that gun.

42
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,116
l just had it fixed like yours.

43
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,919
You got lucky with it,
l thought l'd try it.

44
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,479
Cole Thornton, you decent? You'd
better be, 'cause l'm coming in.

45
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,758
Good to see you.
l didn't believe you were here.

46
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,991
l thought you'd forgotten
all about me, l thought...

47
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,511
Hi, JP.

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,119
- What's so funny?
- This whole thing.

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,910
Do you know what
she's laughing about?

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,195
l gather you knew him
before you knew me.

51
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,068
- l knew her when she was a kid.
- Didn't you know that, JP?

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,154
You never mentioned that. Until now,
l thought you had good taste.

53
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,835
Until now,
l thought she had good taste.

54
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,229
l'm awful glad you two are friends.

55
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,595
We may not be
when we think this over.

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,798
- Then l'm through with you both.
- We better get ourselves a new girl.

57
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,474
- Yeah.
- You better not.

58
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,233
l'm girl enough for you both.
Can l buy you a drink?

59
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,350
l'd like that, but l promised JP
l'd do something for him, didn't l?

60
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,478
- You did.
- lf you want to do my errand...

61
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,835
No, you do your own work, Cole.

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,709
- Will you buy us that drink later?
- Sure will.

63
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,155
Where is this Bart Jason's place?

64
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,515
You take the main road
north out of town.

65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,353
You cross the creek,
and you come to a big rock.

66
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,557
- Big rock.
- Right. That's MacDonald's boundary.

67
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,392
MacDonald's?

68
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,076
Ride east from there about 3 miles
and you get to Bart Jason's ranch.

69
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,072
Maudie, remember, l'm coming back.

70
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,832
- l left some things...
- l'll take care of it.

71
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,831
Thanks.

72
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,196
- You mad at me, JP?
- You know better than that, Maudie.

73
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,236
You must like that man.

74
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,511
- Want me to tell you about him?
- You don't have to.

75
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,434
l know l don't.
That's why l want to.

76
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,672
l met Cole right after my husband
was killed. l did tell you that.

77
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,548
- Yeah, you told me.
- There l was, stranded...

78
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,599
A gambler's widow,
not a chip to my name.

79
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,749
Cole was awful good to me. Gave me
a stake, helped me get on my feet.

80
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,718
Never would take a...

81
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,232
l don't know, JP.
With Cole and me, l guess it's a...

82
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,551
- l'll always think of him as a...
- He's a top hand.

83
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,350
- l guess so.
- Well, Cole always was pretty lucky.

84
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,513
- Have you known him long?
- Yes, since before the war.

85
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,754
- We've travelled some together.
- Sure, l know what that means.

86
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,516
lt means either you saved his life,
or he saved yours, or both.

87
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,717
And neither of you
will talk about it. Men!

88
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,475
Would you like it set to music,
with a full orchestra?

89
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,394
- l'll see you.
- Don't forget to come back.

90
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,109
- l won't leave you alone with him.
- You're not a friend.

91
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,072
Hell.

92
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,190
MacDonald. Kevin MacDonald.

93
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,874
Howdy, Roy. Something wrong?

94
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,350
Doc Miller said to tell you
Bart Jason hired himself a gunhand.

95
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,637
Cole Thornton. He rode
out there about an hour ago.

96
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,280
Doc wanted you to know.
He said be careful.

97
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,716
Thanks, Roy. Tell Doc
l'm much obliged to both of you.

98
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,114
Matt, you and Saul help me
take these horses back to the ranch.

99
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,113
Joey, go to the West Fork and tell
Jared to get back to the ranch.

100
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,952
OK, Pa.

101
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,034
- Luke.
- Yes, Pa.

102
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,352
Get onto that rock. lf you see anyone
coming, fire in the air to warn us.

103
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,638
- All right, Pa.
- Wait a minute, l ain't finished.

104
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,116
As soon as you fire that shot,
jump on your horse and hightail it.

105
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,156
l hear you, Pa.

106
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,151
All right, let's go.

107
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,599
- Where can l find Mister Jason?
- He's up at the main house.

108
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,876
Mr Jason, you got a visitor.

109
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,389
- Cole Thornton?
- That's right.

110
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,118
l'm Bart Jason.

111
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,795
l've been expecting you. Get off your
horse, make yourself comfortable.

112
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,439
l won't be here long enough for that.

113
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,319
Here's what's left
of your expense money.

114
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,712
Sorry about the rest of it,
but that's the chance you take.

115
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,996
l've decided against working for you.

116
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,311
Before you even talked about it?

117
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,951
No, you wouldn't do that.
You must've talked to somebody.

118
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,759
l did. The sheriff.

119
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,354
His story is a little different
from yours

120
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,678
Well, perhaps the law
doesn't quite see it my way.

121
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,154
Since when did hired guns get choosy?

122
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,676
- You're paid to...
- l'm paid to risk my neck.

123
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,230
l'll decide where and when
l'll do it. This isn't it.

124
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:27,030
l've got an idea you just don't want
to go up against Sheriff J P Harrah.

125
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,315
You know, you're just about right.

126
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,189
- You think he's that good?
- l tell you he's that good.

127
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,552
And, Mr Jason,
l see you don't wear a gun.

128
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,712
So l guess you always hire it done.

129
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,077
l'll give you
a little piece of advice.

130
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,518
lf this bunch is all you've got,
don't tangle with Harrah.

131
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,316
'Cause they don't look tough enough
to me to stomp a stringy jackrabbit.

132
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,076
Well, Thornton, if that's
the way you think, l don't want you.

133
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,151
That's good enough for me...

134
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,870
Fancy vest, go ahead
and pull that rifle if you want to,

135
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,758
but you better speak to your boss
before you use it,

136
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,149
'cause he'll be dead
before l hit the ground.

137
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,109
Don't be a damn fool, Joe.
Go over there where he can see you.

138
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,954
l'll remember what you said,
Mr Thornton.

139
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,996
You do that.

140
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,835
Don't shoot no more, mister.

141
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,672
Please.

142
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,396
l won't.

143
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,794
Let me have a look at it.

144
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,436
- lt's bad, isn't it?
- lt isn't good.

145
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,557
My insides feel like they're on fire.

146
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,359
- Can l make you more comfortable?
- No, don't touch me, please.

147
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,676
- What's your name, son?
- MacDonald.

148
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,716
Luke MacDonald.

149
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,676
l can't stand it.

150
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,628
- Kevin MacDonald's boy?
- One of 'em.

151
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,756
l'm gonna have to get you home.

152
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,594
No, don't move me.
Please don't move me.

153
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,837
lt's no use. l know it ain't no use.

154
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,350
Pa told me. Just don't touch me.

155
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,272
Well...

156
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,715
- There were two shots, Pa.
- l heard 'em.

157
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,030
- Luke should be back by now.
- l know.

158
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,551
Oh, no.

159
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,949
- Are we going, Pa?
- Where?

160
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,158
- Luke could be in bad trouble.
- lf he is, we won't be any help now.

161
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,755
He went there to warn us.
He's warned us.

162
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,958
Better off here, where there's cover.
Find a good place inside that shed.

163
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,156
Jos'e and Miguel, go with him.

164
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,074
Danny, Felipe, come here.
Over behind that wall.

165
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,230
You gals, get in the house.

166
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,279
- Matt, we'll wait inside.
- All right, Pa.

167
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,790
Matt, go to that window.
Do nothing till l tell you.

168
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,229
Come out and get your boy.

169
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,912
- He's dead, ain't he?
- He's dead.

170
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,992
Jos'e, Miguel,
get him down from there.

171
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,318
- What happened?
- Luke, he's been killed.

172
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,312
l'm waiting to hear what happened.

173
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,395
l'll tell you what happened.

174
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,153
You left a boy out there
to do a man's job.

175
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,589
He went to sleep.
When l came by, he woke up,

176
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,116
jumped up and started firing his gun.

177
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,556
All l saw was somebody
shooting at me from the rocks.

178
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,676
- Cole Thornton.
- Yes, ma'am.

179
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,432
l don't believe you.

180
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,717
l don't care much, miss,
whether you do or not.

181
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,436
Pa's handling this. Just wait.

182
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,829
Get in the house, girl.

183
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,869
How do you know he was asleep?

184
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,316
He told me that.

185
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,314
He told me his name.
That's how l knew where to bring him.

186
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,836
He said you told him what happens
to a man that's gut shot.

187
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,476
How he hasn't got much of a chance.
Did you tell him that?

188
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,516
l told him that.

189
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,875
Then you're partly to blame.

190
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,914
You'll find two bullets in him.
One of them's mine.

191
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,589
He was hurtin' worse
than he could stand.

192
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,035
Had a handgun that l didn't see.

193
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,710
Any more questions you want to ask?

194
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,829
No. l guess you're telling the truth.

195
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,037
lf you weren't
you'd never have brought him here.

196
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,872
l thank you for that.

197
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,036
lt don't help much.

198
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,149
l reckon you won't shoot
any more little boys, mister.

199
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,716
Next time you shoot somebody,

200
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,349
don't go near them
till you're sure they're dead.

201
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,113
l don't know why you're still alive.

202
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,636
l don't know how
l missed you from that range.

203
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,156
You didn't miss.

204
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,836
Now get out of here.

205
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,270
JP, open that window, will you?

206
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,716
That's better. The smell of that
chloroform's putting me to sleep.

207
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,238
Hold him, Maudie.
Don't let him move too sudden.

208
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,072
All right.

209
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,389
He'll be waking up now.

210
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,074
lt's all right, Cole. lt's Maudie.

211
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,276
All right, Maudie.

212
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,834
- Who are you?
- The name's Miller.

213
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,354
Some people call me a doctor,
some other things.

214
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,431
But l'm the only one in town.

215
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,194
- Did you get the bullet out?
- No.

216
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,877
Then why this bandage?
Let's get to it.

217
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,394
- l can't.
- Why not?

218
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,995
Because l'm not good enough.
That bullet's up against your spine.

219
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,870
lf l try to get it out, l'll only
finish what someone else started.

220
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,589
- So what happens?
- You'll heal all right.

221
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,469
When you get to a big town, find
a doctor who knows more than l do.

222
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,994
One of them new-fangled squirts.

223
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,676
They'll fix you up in no time.
But don't wait too long to do it.

224
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,515
Any chance of gettin' some coffee
or a shot of whisky around here?

225
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,672
- Linda.
- Linda, bring both of them.

226
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,876
Can he be moved?

227
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,558
Sure, in a couple of hours.
But don't go bouncing him around.

228
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,996
He can stay here.
l'll make him comfortable.

229
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,036
l've got a fine bed at my place.

230
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,638
lt's narrow, hard and uncomfortable,
but he won't get bounced around.

231
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,714
Señor Bull. He comes.

232
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,596
Bull always announces his arrival
that way?

233
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,593
Same way, different tune.
You better let him in.

234
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,673
What are you blowing,
advance or retreat?

235
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,596
Neither. Couldn't let one of General
Hood's Cavalry go without a goodbye.

236
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,958
- Who's goin' away?
- Cole's leaving tonight.

237
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,713
You got any objections, Doc,
l don't want to hear 'em.

238
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,117
Glad to get you off my hands.
Where you going?

239
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,031
Sonora.

240
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,917
Folks down there got a silver mine.
A little trouble.

241
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,956
Think l might be of help.

242
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,317
l brung along a little red-eye,
in case the sheriff runs out.

243
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,470
Somehow, l reckon he has.

244
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,279
Been here a long time,
nobody's offered me a drink.

245
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,113
- Why didn't you speak up?
- Thought you'd never ask.

246
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,159
- Maudie, get him a glass, will you?
- What'll we drink to first?

247
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,918
l guess l should have told you.

248
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,276
Sometimes you...

249
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,070
l was hoping
to see you alone before you left.

250
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,233
- lt's better this way, Maudie.
- Come back, will you?

251
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,518
- l will when...
- When you can forget Luke MacDonald?

252
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,798
When you can look at the other
MacDonalds and not feel you owe them?

253
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,597
Pretty wise for a kid, Maudie.

254
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,920
l think you must be the only person
who thinks of me as a kid, Cole.

255
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,076
l don't really.

256
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,636
Please don't.

257
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,155
l'll see you, Maudie.

258
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,316
That the way you make your living?

259
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,517
By golly, Cole,
it sure is good to see you.

260
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,160
What sheriff had to hire you
for a deputy?

261
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,515
You're looking at him. Hiya, Cole.

262
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,916
Dodd Draper!
The last time l saw you two,

263
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,754
you were ten jumps ahead of a posse
raisin' dust for Mexico.

264
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,391
- Heard you got shot.
- That was six or seven months ago.

265
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,313
How about supper?
l'll buy you a beer, too.

266
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,550
We'd like to, but we're working men.

267
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,275
How about that cantina up the street?
Good place to eat?

268
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,477
- Good as any. You sticking around?
- Day or two.

269
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,313
Well, we'll see you later, Cole.

270
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,315
Your dinner will be ready
in one minute.

271
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,557
Bring something to eat. Plenty of it.

272
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,995
- Right away.
- Something to drink, also.

273
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,557
Five and one.

274
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,999
- Charlie Hagan.
- Yeah.

275
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,195
You want something from me?

276
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,071
- You don't remember me, do you?
- No.

277
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,554
- Do you remember this hat?
- Why would l remember a hat?

278
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,193
You killed the man
that was wearing it

279
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,352
Ladies.

280
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,796
Who was this fellow l killed?
A friend of yours?

281
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,711
You could say that.

282
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,113
- When did l do this, boy?
- Two years ago, come September.

283
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,475
You and three others.

284
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,916
Natchez-Under-the-Hill,
on the Mississippi.

285
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,876
He was a gambler, named
Johnny Diamond, kind of an old man.

286
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,718
- Shouldn't have taken four of you.
- Remember, Charlie?

287
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,156
l remember. He was a cardsharp.
He was cheating.

288
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,835
No, he was good.
He didn't have to cheat.

289
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,311
- lt shouldn't have taken 4 of you.
- No, it shouldn't.

290
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,870
l'm sure glad you remember,
Mr Hagan. The other three did.

291
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,478
- The other three?
- Yeah, l caught up with them.

292
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,435
You're the last.

293
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,916
And now l think you better stand up.

294
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,073
Stand up, Charlie.
l'm curious to see how he does this.

295
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,236
He doesn't have a gun.

296
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,108
And like he said,
it shouldn't have taken four of you.

297
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,831
Stand up, Charlie.

298
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,316
You with the hat.

299
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,600
You killed Charlie
'cause he killed your friend?

300
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,717
- Right.
- Well, Charlie was a friend of mine.

301
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,235
So let's see you do that trick twice.

302
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,037
l'd let it drop.

303
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,310
- Me?
- You.

304
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,677
- Hope you don't mind.
- Always seems to take more than one.

305
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,916
That's because they're no good.

306
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,600
- Pick up your gun.
- What?

307
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,078
You want to try again, now?
Pick up your gun.

308
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,236
Against him, or you?

309
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,390
- Me first.
- Why should you go first?

310
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,436
- Pick it up.
- Wait...

311
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,476
Tell me later. Shut up!

312
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,233
Go on. You were willing
when you had a kid...

313
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,949
Hold it! Don't get mad, mister.

314
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,715
Before you start anything,
l can't afford to lose another man.

315
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,433
- You promise to take Milt's place?
- You got faith in me, don't you?

316
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,160
Faith can move mountains, Milt,
but it can't beat a faster draw.

317
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,233
There's only three men l know
with his kind of speed.

318
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,480
One's dead, the other's me,
and the third is Cole Thornton.

319
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,596
There's a fourth.

320
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,150
- Which one are you?
- l'm Thornton.

321
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,156
Glad you didn't try, Milt?

322
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,353
Pick up your guns, both of you.
Real easy.

323
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,398
Like he said, real easy.

324
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,029
And take him out of here.

325
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,990
l'd like to talk to you.
l'm Nelse McLeod.

326
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,516
l thought so. Pretty far
off your range, aren't you?

327
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,511
A little. Drink?

328
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,716
- Why not?
- You, too.

329
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,677
Glasses.

330
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,069
- You working now, Thornton?
- No.

331
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,756
- ls it all right if music play now?
- Yeah, sure.

332
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,878
You're not working. What would
you say if l tried to hire you?

333
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,629
- First l'd ask about the money.
- Money's good.

334
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,756
Then l'd ask about the job.

335
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,229
Good evening.
Thanks for the drink, gentlemen.

336
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,154
- Just a minute, son.
- l am not your son.

337
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,835
My name is Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

338
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,195
- Lord Almighty.
- Yeah.

339
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,555
That's why most people call me
Mississippi.

340
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,359
- Mississippi?
- l was born on the river in a boat.

341
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,477
You're pretty good with that knife.
Can you use a gun?

342
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,878
lf l could, l'd be using one.
Good evening.

343
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,235
Just a minute, Mississippi.

344
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,188
Why do you have
such a great passion for my company?

345
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,272
Will you just relax
for a couple of minutes?

346
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,351
About that job.

347
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,193
A little range war
in the El Dorado country.

348
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,630
El Dorado?
Mind telling me who hired you?

349
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,395
Fellow named Bart Jason.
Do you know him?

350
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,270
We met. He offered me the job
a few months back. l didn't take it.

351
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,270
Do you know who you're up against?

352
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,079
Yeah. The sheriff, J P Harrah.

353
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,594
l understand he used to be
pretty good with a gun.

354
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,797
Not just pretty good, McLeod.
He's the...

355
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,429
- The fourth man you told me about.
- Right.

356
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,034
He used to be. He's not any more.

357
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,357
- What happened?
- What usually happens to a man.

358
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,192
A woman.

359
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,319
Seems he tangled with some wandering
petticoat, been drunk ever since.

360
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,556
You're moving in before he sobers up,
or before they get a new sheriff?

361
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,438
- And you're not coming in?
- No.

362
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,114
l suppose you have your reasons.

363
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,279
lt's probably just as well.

364
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,670
With two like us in the same bunch,

365
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,672
sooner or later
we'd have to find out who was faster.

366
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,480
Yeah, l guess you're right.

367
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,956
So long, Thornton.

368
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,470
l thought we were going.

369
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,595
Mississippi, just listen.

370
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,435
McLeod, would you like to walk out
that door first, ahead of us.

371
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,597
No, l don't believe l would.

372
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,792
l didn't think so.

373
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,756
Can you hear me?

374
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,509
- We hear you.
- l'm coming out.

375
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,156
Where are you?

376
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,394
- Over here.
- Come on out.

377
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,715
Further into the light, hurry.

378
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,631
Now drop your guns.

379
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,476
Come here.

380
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,436
lnside.

381
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,631
- That all right, Thornton?
- Good enough.

382
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,553
Mississippi, get their guns.

383
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,599
lf it's all right with you, we'll
drop 'em at the sheriff's office

384
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,752
and they can pick 'em up
on their way out of town.

385
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,595
- Sounds reasonable.
- Much obliged.

386
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,268
Call it professional courtesy.

387
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,676
Want to get something to eat?

388
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,198
l would've walked right into
those two, if you hadn't stopped me.

389
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,192
- l asked if you were hungry.
- l'm trying to thank you.

390
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,909
l'm hungry. That shivaree you put
on in there interrupted my supper.

391
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,956
lt wore out our welcome.

392
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,190
We'll have to find
someplace else to eat.

393
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,557
- Now?
- Now.

394
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,830
She wants to know
if you want something else.

395
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,476
Just coffee.

396
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,554
- Not very hungry?
- No, not so much.

397
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,352
- A little green around the gills.
- Yeah.

398
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,153
l just finished something tonight
l've been two years doing.

399
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,313
What are you figuring on doing next?
Going back to the river?

400
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,354
l haven't thought much
about what l'm going to do next.

401
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,476
The river won't be the same
without old...

402
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,599
lf you're going to stay around here,
l've got two pieces of advice.

403
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,878
Get rid of that hat.
Learn how to use a gun.

404
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,111
- l don't want to get rid of the hat.
- No?

405
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,476
No.

406
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,919
Johnny Diamond, he's the friend l...
the man that raised me.

407
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,317
All he left behind was
a gold watch and this hat.

408
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,190
l had to sell that gold watch
a year or so back.

409
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,069
So l guess
l'll just hang on to that hat.

410
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,317
What about learning to use a gun?

411
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,193
Johnny didn't believe in guns.
He always thought that...

412
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,874
He's dead. Think about that.

413
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,192
Unless you can
learn to stay out of trouble.

414
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,398
That's one thing even old Johnny
couldn't teach me to do.

415
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,632
Well, l'll be moving along.
Good luck to you.

416
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,392
You don't suppose
l could ride along with you?

417
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,120
- No.
- That's plain enough.

418
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,318
- l hope everything works out.
- What works out?

419
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,670
Whatever it is you're going to do.

420
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,951
Pay for the meal, will you?
So long.

421
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,628
Hold it, Cochise.

422
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,758
Steady boy. l'll take a minute.

423
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,756
Where are you?

424
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,509
Close enough to blow your hat off
if l hadn't recognised it.

425
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,199
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

426
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,829
Don't you know better
than to follow a man that way?

427
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,753
- l don't know another way.
- You almost got shot.

428
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,678
- You fall off your horse?
- Yeah.

429
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,398
- You hurt?
- No.

430
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,436
Something's the matter.

431
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,911
l've got a bullet in my back, it
sometimes presses against something.

432
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,790
l get a screaming pain, then it goes
numb, and l can't use this hand.

433
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,999
- How long does that last?
- A while. Why are you following me?

434
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,828
l started thinking about
what you're going to do.

435
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,556
And what am l going to do?

436
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,158
You're going to El Dorado to help
your friend against McLeod.

437
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,840
How do you know he's my friend?

438
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,794
That look on your face when you heard
he'd turned into a drunk.

439
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,068
lt's wearing off.

440
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,549
Give me a hand up on my horse.

441
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,954
You sure your friend's worth helping?

442
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,995
You spent two years chasing
the fellows that killed your friend.

443
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,197
You think your friend
was worth two years?

444
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,239
- l guess l asked a fool question.
- You did.

445
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,837
Give him a breather. Slow him down.

446
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,391
l was wondering.
Just how good is this McLeod?

447
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,913
l don't know first hand,
but they say he's one of the best.

448
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,279
l figure he'd be mad you turned him
down and showed up on the other side.

449
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,318
- l hope he is.
- How come?

450
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,597
Fellow in his business
hasn't got a right to get mad.

451
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,274
He gets mad, he's not so good.

452
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,397
So the madder he gets,
the better l like it.

453
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,119
Sure wish l was there to see that.

454
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,919
Why do you want to keep
sticking your nose in this?

455
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,197
Maybe l could help.
You saved my life two times.

456
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,636
But l'm going to be too busy
to keep doing that.

457
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,271
- You can't even use a gun.
- l need somebody to teach me.

458
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,749
Johnny Diamond always told me
to get the best.

459
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,799
He was right there.
But you're not going to El Dorado.

460
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,589
- l'm not?
- No, you're not.

461
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,194
''Gaily bedight, A gallant knight,

462
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,359
''ln sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long...''

463
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,875
- What's that all about?
- Just a poem.

464
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,916
One of Johnny Diamond's favourites.

465
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,833
Let's see: ''Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,

466
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,676
''ln sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long, singing a song,

467
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,553
''ln search of El Dorado.

468
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,509
''Over the mountains of the moon,
Down the valley of the shadow,

469
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,319
''Ride, boldly ride...''

470
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,155
Always liked that poem, too.
Makes me want to...

471
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,791
Ride, boldly ride?
lt don't work out that way.

472
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,950
l'm learning that.

473
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,473
Hell. Hold it, Cochise.

474
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,108
- Step down off that horse.
- You always giving people orders?

475
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,279
You wanted to learn to shoot.

476
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,356
Right out there.

477
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,599
Hold it, Mississippi.
That's no way to use a handgun.

478
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,639
You have to draw and fire,
quicker than the other person.

479
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,676
Like this.

480
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,677
l see.

481
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,318
- How's that?
- Were you aiming at that cholla?

482
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,390
- No, the place you were shooting at.
- 'Fraid it's useless.

483
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,677
We'll be passing through Cuervo.
l'll have a talk with the Swede.

484
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,830
Who's the Swede?

485
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,798
An old friend of mine, a gunsmith.

486
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,876
There's the place.

487
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,472
- Swede, good to see you.
- What brings you here?

488
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,315
l'm looking for a gun for a fella
that can't shoot. Mississippi.

489
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,231
Swede Larson.

490
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,074
- Can you help us?
- l've got just what you want.

491
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,037
Good.

492
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,390
How wide will that shot spread?
How big a pattern?

493
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,195
l don't know. The fellow who used it
before, he couldn't see too good.

494
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,874
He just shoot where he hear
somebody talk.

495
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,270
- What happened to him?
- He has a fight in a saloon.

496
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,352
The piano player
he make so much noise,

497
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,910
he couldn't hear the other man,
so he just shoot the piano player,

498
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,956
and they hung him.

499
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,077
- Looks pretty good to me.
- Shoots good, too.

500
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,230
How about ammunition?

501
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,869
- Four or five boxes are enough.
- Good.

502
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,839
- Looks like what you need.
- Sure is.

503
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,038
- Pay the man. Swede.
- Cole, you come back soon.

504
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,796
A likely spot to try that new gun.

505
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,836
Try that cactus.

506
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,355
You can't miss with that.

507
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,076
lt's all right.

508
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,357
- How far to El Dorado?
- We'll be in there around midnight.

509
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,676
Where are we headed?

510
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,149
- To see a girl.
- A girl?

511
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,310
Yes, a girl.

512
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,755
Don't you think l could know a girl?

513
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,674
- l always make you mad, don't l?
- Mostly.

514
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,357
Hold it. This. This is it.

515
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,713
Keep it quiet. l need to talk to you.

516
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,631
l'll let you in.

517
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,436
- Keep your eyes open.
- You pick the darnedest times...

518
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,717
- Who's he?
- Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

519
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,270
- Just call him Mississippi for now.
- Hi, Mississippi.

520
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,316
- Stay there and watch.
- Couldn't l...?

521
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,277
No.

522
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,109
l'm so glad to see you.
l've got so many things to tell you.

523
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,228
l've got a lot to say to you, but
first l've got to have some answers.

524
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,791
- Are there any strangers in town?
- No, l'd have known if there were.

525
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,916
This one you'd have noticed:

526
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,276
a dark, thin faced man
with a scar and a marled eye.

527
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,033
- Nelse McLeod.
- Nelse? l've heard of him.

528
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,998
Should've had four or five
riders with him.

529
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,150
- He's not here yet.
- Good.

530
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,470
At least we beat them in.

531
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,676
Now, about JP.

532
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,312
- Want the whole story?
- Just don't make it too long.

533
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,472
After you left,
l didn't see much of him.

534
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,031
He'd drop in for a drink once
in a while. l guess he was lonely.

535
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,033
One day a girl came into town,
just stepped off the stage and...

536
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,031
You know how kind...

537
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,955
She probably had big sad eyes and
a long sad story. That's his type.

538
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,272
Yeah. She was no good.
l tried to tell him, so did others.

539
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,750
Bull told him
and he knocked Bull down.

540
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,356
So JP had found out the hard way.
She ran off with a drummer.

541
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,398
He's not been sober since.
lt's been about two months.

542
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,517
Well, that he's going
to have to get over quickly.

543
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,276
- ls he over at the jail?
- He's sheriff, l don't know why.

544
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,150
We'll mosey... Have you got a room
for Mississippi and me?

545
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,153
Sure.
Have you eaten anything lately?

546
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,836
- No.
- l'll have something ready for you.

547
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,672
l'm glad you're here.

548
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,313
- Don't tell anybody you saw us.
- l won't.

549
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,159
- l found one thing out.
- What?

550
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,390
You know a girl.

551
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,312
Hold it.

552
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,675
lt's as far as you can come now.

553
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,876
Unless you've got some business here.

554
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,635
l sure have got business here, Bull.
Cole Thornton.

555
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,832
lf it hadn't been so dark
l might have spotted you.

556
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,150
Might have anyhow,
if l hadn't been trying to figure out

557
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,118
what that other fellow's
got on top of his head.

558
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,795
- lt's called a hat.
- l'll have to take your word for it.

559
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,997
He's a friend of mine.
They call him Mississippi.

560
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,036
- Glad to know you.
- Bull.

561
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,436
Glad you're here, Cole.
Our friend the sheriff ain't so good.

562
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,556
l just talked to Maudie.

563
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,677
He's back there sleeping.

564
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,638
Being as how you've known him
longer than l have,

565
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,518
you know enough to be careful
how you wake him up,

566
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,034
'cause he's a bad one
when he's drinking.

567
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,112
He ain't put that stopper
back in that bottle in a coon's age.

568
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,115
l know. You got someplace where
you can put these horses under cover?

569
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,350
- Sure.
- Give him a hand.

570
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,719
Bull, l'd just as soon everybody
didn't know we were back in town yet.

571
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,634
- What's up? Something in the wind?
- Jason's starting some more trouble.

572
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,236
l ain't surprised.
My neck itches like it used to

573
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,359
when a Comanche was around
and l couldn't see him.

574
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,949
Damn you, Bull.

575
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,276
What the hell are you doing here?

576
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,388
l'm looking at a tin star
with a drunk pinned on it.

577
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,794
Cole Thornton. How about that!

578
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,633
How about that! lt's good old Cole.
Help me up out of here, Cole.

579
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,115
Come on, just pull me right on up.

580
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,156
Cole, he won't feel it.

581
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,274
Well, l owe him one.

582
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,836
Either one of you know
a fast way to sober a man up?

583
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,077
A bunch of howlin' lndians
out for hair will do it quick.

584
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,549
Johnny Diamond had a recipe.

585
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:19,031
Let's see: cayenne pepper;
mustard, the hot kind; ipecac;

586
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,598
asafoetida; oil of cloves, or was
it..? No, it was croton oil.

587
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,397
Croton oil? l'll be a suck-egg mule!
You know what that'll do to a fellow?

588
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,357
Guaranteed kill or cure.

589
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,318
You know where you could get
that stuff this time of night?

590
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,188
Greener's store would have it.
May have to wake him up.

591
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,159
Go on with him, Mississippi.
Make sure he doesn't forget anything.

592
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,231
l... Look out, Cole!

593
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,392
Aren't you going to get that stuff?
He's all right.

594
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,600
- Get it before he wakes up again.
- Sure.

595
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,075
Let's see, we've got ipecac,
mustard, cayenne,

596
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,628
that leaves us asafoetida.

597
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,795
Are you sure that Johnny Diamond
wasn't an embalmer?

598
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,235
- Here's your gunpowder.
- Gunpowder?

599
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,392
Yeah. Mississippi remembered it
on the way to the store.

600
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,596
- Put it in.
- All of it?

601
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,629
- All of it.
- l hope you don't blow him up.

602
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,919
Well, it looks done.

603
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,716
Well, let's get it into him.

604
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,633
Bull, you sit on his legs.

605
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,592
- Cole, pin down his arms.
- Don't worry about us.

606
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,150
Get hold of his nose. lf he can't
breathe, he'll have to swallow.

607
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,595
Give him one for me.

608
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,755
- All down.
- Let's get out of here.

609
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,790
Lock him in.

610
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,552
- We're coming in.
- Come ahead.

611
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,039
- Howdy, Cole, Mississippi.
- How's our friend?

612
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,636
Nary a peep. Not even moved,
not one twist the last two hours.

613
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,476
- You reckon he'll be all right?
- Ask him. lt's his concoction.

614
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,997
l don't know how all right he'll be,
but he won't be drinking for a while.

615
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,594
- How come?
- lt does something to the stomach.

616
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,069
- lt won't hold liquor.
- You sure?

617
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,913
Sure, l'm sure, given he's human.

618
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,992
He's human all right.
He's got to be.

619
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,833
No other critter on earth
would make such a fool of himself.

620
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,556
Come open this door.

621
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,076
He's still drunk. Open it yourself,
it ain't even locked.
