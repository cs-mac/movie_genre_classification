Let me introduce the two finalists.

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,600
You move so wonderfully.

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,500
Your dancing has no weakness.

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,840
(Kim So Hee, the perfect performer)

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,900
(YG wants to sign her right away.)

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,930

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,770
(If KWINs wins this season?)

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,100

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,500

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,630
(The highest score of the season and the only 100.)

19
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,770
If they win...

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,800
(The youngest winners of an audition.)

21
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,170
(Singing! Dancing! Rap!)

22
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,170
(An amazing rise to the top)

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,470
(The judges are speechless when the 11-year-olds perform.)

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,070
(Let's wins this competition!)

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,600
(If they truly enjoy themselves on stage,)

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,030
(no one can stop them.)

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,470
(Boyfriend)

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,370
The second finalist.

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,230
The 11-year-olds who never cease to transform.

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,230
These are the two finalists of K-Pop Star 6.

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,530
Please give them a warm welcome.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,730
Survival audition K-Pop Star 6.

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,700
I'm your host Jun Hyun Moo.

36
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,030
It's the final show.

37
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,030
It's the final of K-Pop Star 6...

38
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,830
and you're watching live.

39
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,670
Which team will be crowned the winner of...

40
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,270
K-Pop Star 6?

41
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,470
Please stay tuned.

42
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,470
I'd like to introduce three people...

43
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,900
who put in a lot of effort to bring K-Pop Star this far.

44
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,400
Part of K-Pop Star's history, it's JYP's Park Jin Young.

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,600
(Park Jin Young, Yang Hyun Suk, Yu Hui Yeol)

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,830
YG's Yang Hyun Suk.

47
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,670
Antenna's Yu Hui Yeol.

48
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,100
We reached the final of K-Pop Star 6.

49
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,130
It's hard to say who will win tonight.

50
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,530
Jin Young, as a judge, how do you think things will go?

51
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,500
Both teams are so talented.

52
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,100
I think whichever of them wins, I wouldn't be surprised.

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,570
Who has more fun tonight and turns this into a festival...

54
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,070
will be whoever we decide will win the competition.

55
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,100
The winning team will create a new record.

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,230
If KWINs wins, they'll be the first girl group to win.

57
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,230
If Boyfriend wins, they'll be the youngest winners ever.

58
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,230
Which team will win tonight?

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,500
Stay tuned and watch.

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,430
Hui Yeol, you tried hard last week to give these two some courage...

61
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,870
- during Antenna Week. - Yes.

62
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,030
How did it go?

63
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,500
Jin Young and Hyun Suk did a lot over the past two weeks.

64
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,470
What they did during JYP Week and YG Week...

65
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,300
made me think they're so fake.

66
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,530
They're smiling so brightly.

67
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,070
I treated them as equals and as genuinely as possible...

68
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,370
and took them where no one else could.

69
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,930
You all went to a very special location.

70
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,970
Let's find out where they went and what happened...

71
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,330
during Antenna Week.

72
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:48,240
(One warm, sunny April day)

73
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,930
The weather's lovely.

74
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,430
(The Top 2 are invited to an unusual location.)

75
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,400
- A ram's horn. - Yes.

76
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,900
- Ram swag. - Ram swag.

77
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,630
Ram swag.

78
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,270
- It's hot. - Gosh.

79
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,500
(Antenna Week)

80
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,330
- I love this. - It's awesome.

81
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,740
- A sauna? - A charcoal sauna.

82
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,870
Let's get warmed up.

83
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,740
(A sauna to help them relax.)

84
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,070
This is amazing.

85
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,800
People who can't stand heat...

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,430
I'd love to jump in here.

87
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,700
It's nice.

88
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,970
We can crack our boiled eggs on Jong Seob's head.

89
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,030
You're good at this.

90
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,270
(Hye Rim folds the towels.)

91
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,400
You're good.

92
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
(So, where is Hui Yeol?)

93
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,030
(The weather's good. It's good enough.)

94
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,670
(It was a perfect day to spend in a sauna.)

95
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,630
What? What?

96
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,230
No, stay lying down. Don't get up.

97
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,700
Hello. You have great skin.

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,970
Hello.

99
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,430
Gosh, it's hot.

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
It's really hot. Hello.

101
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,030
(He's as popular as the host of a long-running singing competition.)

102
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,470
It's nice.

103
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,370
To Jin Young or Hyun Suk...

104
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,770
this is a luxury.

105
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,270
Renting boats that aren't his.

106
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,000
How lovely is this?

107
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,730
I come here often.

108
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,870
Hello.

109
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,230
Hello.

110
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,700
(The sauna owner's here.)

111
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,030
- Hello. - Hello.

112
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,800
- Hello. - Hello, everyone.

113
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,830
- The clothes suit you. - You look good.

114
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,370
- Hello. - Hello.

115
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,470
(Gosh)

116
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,330
You look so cute. Seeing you in here now,

117
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,700
you don't look like K-Pop Star contestants.

118
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,400
You look like kids who are here with your parents.

119
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,700
Last week,

120
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,900
did Hyun Suk take you out on a boat?

121
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,100
- Yes. - Yes.

122
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,230
It wasn't his.

123
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,330
Jin Young took you out...

124
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,600
- for Korean broiled chicken. - Yes.

125
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,330
He doesn't like broiled chicken.

126
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,100
(Hui Yeol criticizes everyone.)

127
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,830
I invited you here for a reason.

128
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,030
To relieve fatigue.

129
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,370
Correct.

130
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,900
Drink this.

131
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,730
- Thank you. - Thank you.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,270
You and I can share a glass of milk.

133
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,030
(Milk in a beer glass)

134
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,330
Let's drink and share our deepest thoughts.

135
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,500
Let's start with a cheer since it's the final week.

136
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,530
- Okay. - Okay?

137
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,170
1, 2, 3.

138
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,670
- For a beautiful meeting. - For a beautiful meeting.

139
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,500
- Good. - Bottom's up?

140
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,970
Well done.

141
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,370
They wrote down some questions for you to answer.

142
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,870
Okay.

143
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,270
- They're anonymous. - Okay.

144
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,930
What would you want to ask me?

145
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,070
Let's see.

146
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,430
"Idol singers aren't allowed to date."

147
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,200
"Don't you need dating experience to write good lyrics?"

148
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,700
"What should I do?"

149
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,330
That's right.

150
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,630
(Who asked the first question?)

151
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,030
- Hyun Jin. - Yes?

152
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,400
He can't hear.

153
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,600
He keeps doing this.

154
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,470
Keep your ears open.

155
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,070
Whenever I speak, he goes, "What?"

156
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,030
He's so cute.

157
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,340
Have you dated someone?

158
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,430
Long ago.

159
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,670
(She's surprised.)

160
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,800
Really?

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,930
- For a very short time. - For a short time?

162
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,070
For between 12 and 13 hours.

163
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,700
Did you date her for about 12 hours?

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,030
- What kind of relationship was it? - I'll tell you.

166
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,600
She asked me to be her boyfriend in the evening,

167
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,130
and the next morning,

168
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,230
she broke up with me.

169
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,370
What did you do?

170
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,840
I pretended I didn't care.

171
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,930
Did you?

172
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,370
Have you ever liked a singer so much you joined her fan club?

173
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,670
I joined Shannon's fan club.

174
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,730
Did you joined her fan club before K-Pop Star began?

175
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,840
Yes, I was a fan of hers.

176
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,700
I came to like her more as I met her on K-Pop Star.

177
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,570
She got eliminated because of you.

178
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,300
(I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention.)

179
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,100
That's true.

180
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,070
- How did you feel when you saw her? - Pardon?

181
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,770
I first saw her in person in the third round.

182
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,930
I couldn't keep my mouth closed.

183
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,840
I saw him standing still like a rock.

184
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
She looked surreal and was difficult to approach.

185
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,200
It felt like I wasn't allowed to talk to her.

186
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,970
That's why you won't need dating experience.

187
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,630
It's not like a writer who writes mystery or scary stories...

188
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,570
actually kills someone.

189
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,400
- That's right. - Right?

190
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,670
Likewise, you can write the lyrics...

191
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,840
about the feelings you had when you saw Shannon.

192
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,700
You said you felt weird when you saw Shannon...

193
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,270
leaving K-Pop Star.

194
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,030
You can write about that feeling as if it's love.

195
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,070
Right.

196
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,730
Shannon was crying.

197
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,530
"What's wrong with my heart?"

198
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,570
"I feel like crying, but tears won't come out."

199
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,130
You can write the lyrics like this.

200
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,670
That's awesome.

201
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,100
Do you think so too? Will you come join Antenna?

202
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,340
(He's taken aback.)

203
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,470
(He's avoiding Hui Yeol's eyes.)

204
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,470
Look at his face. He just hates the idea.

205
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,830
The next question is...

206
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,300
"You cried when the contestants were eliminated in previous seasons."

207
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,730
(You cried when the contestants were eliminated.)

208
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,570
"It made me feel sad too."

209
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,870
"Do you cry often?"

210
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,870
I don't cry often.

211
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,300
When the contestant, Hong Jung Hee,

212
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,230
was eliminated...

213
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,630
It was season three.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,330
It was the first season I joined K-Pop Star as a judge.

215
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,530
I was a new judge,

216
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,230
and I didn't know anything about K-Pop Star.

217
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,800
I think I was full of passion just like you guys.

218
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,330
When she got eliminated,

219
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,200
I thought it was my fault.

220
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,800
I burst into tears even before I knew.

221
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,230
I believe that the contestants gained a lot through the experience.

222
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,570
So did I.

223
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,730
You play a very important role.

224
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,500
You represent the hope of all the previous contestants...

225
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,830
throughout the series.

226
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,930
The two teams will compete intensely in the final round.

227
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,700
You have to do your best to give a good performance.

228
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,530
I think that's your job.

229
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,970
- I understand. - We'll do that.

230
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,570
I saved something for the final round.

231
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,600
The contestants who trained at Antenna...

232
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,030
left a gift in my office without letting me know.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,230
They bought me a gift.

234
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,830
They bought a tie for me.

235
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,570
The five of them pitched in to buy it.

236
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,830
They left a letter with the gift.

237
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,600
So I decided to wear the tie in the final round...

238
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,870
as it's the last time.

239
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,400
There's nothing else I can do for them now.

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,830
The contestants whom I trained...

241
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,530
will probably see me wearing the tie.

242
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,400
Before then, I had talked to him only when he evaluated me.

243
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,700
It was the first time I talked to him personally.

244
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,270
I was grateful that he made me feel so comfortable.

245
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,970
He's always kind to us.

246
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,370
I'm very grateful that he prepared...

247
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,470
something that was of great help to us.

248
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,000
Good luck!

249
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,730
- We can do it! - We can do it!

250
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,900
Thank you.

251
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,330
(With his cheerful words, Antenna Week is over!)

252
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,130
Hui Yeol, we enjoyed watching Antenna Week.

253
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,830
You must be wearing the tie.

254
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,770
Yes, I am. This is the tie...

255
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,300
that the contestants I trained bought for me.

256
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,370
They left a tie and a letter in my office.

257
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,100
I felt bad that the contestants trained at Antenna couldn't move up.

258
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,770
As today is the last day, I decided to wear this tie.

259
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,330
It's a very meaningful tie.

260
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,370
Hyun Suk, what do you think of Antenna Week?

261
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,770
- I thought of two things. - I see.

262
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,300
First of all, Hui Yeol is a celebrity, singer,

263
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,070
and a show host.

264
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,700
It was hard to believe that he seemed like an ordinary man.

265
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,800
- That's what I thought. - I see.

266
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,630
The other thing I thought was...

267
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,600
Hyun Jin said he likes Shannon, right?

268
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,000
- I was a big fan of someone. - Right.

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,770
- She's Im Ye Jin. - Im Ye Jin?

270
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,630
I liked her when I was in middle school.

271
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,130
She might be watching this show right now.

272
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,830
She's currently working with YG.

273
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,800
I realized that life is...

274
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,530
- Life is unpredictable. - I realized it's unpredictable.

275
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,800
At his age, boys tend to like older girls.

276
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,270
I could see that Hui Yeol made a lot of effort...

277
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,500
to have a good time with them.

278
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,630
Thank you. The talk in the spa was very impressive.

279
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I'll explain the rules of the final round.

280
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,730
The contestants will give two performances.

281
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,000
In the first part, they will sing...

282
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,970
the song they chose.

283
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,430
In the second round, they will sing the song each other sang...

284
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,470
in one of the previous rounds.

285
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,070
They have to perform a given song...

286
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,070
that each other sang in one of the previous rounds...

287
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,730
and received positive responses.

288
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,930
Please look forward to finding out which song they will perform.

289
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,730
Today's round is expected to be the most intense. In this round,

290
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,570
the judges' scores will count for 60 percent of the total score,

291
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,830
and the viewers' votes will count for 40 percent for both parts.

292
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,930
The total score will decide the winner of K-Pop Star.

293
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,070
Now I'll tell you the order of performance and each team's number.

294
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,730
The ace girl group who made their dream come true.

295
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,230
Number one, KWINs. Kim So Hee, Chrisha Choo, and Kim Hye Rim.

296
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,330
They're number one.

297
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,170
No one can stop them.

298
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,530
The 11-year-old dark horses who turned the game around.

299
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,900
Number two, Boyfriend. Park Hyun Jin and Kim Jong Seob.

300
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,030
They're number two.

301
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,830
Please stay tuned to the end of the two teams' final match.

302
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,270
This is the final round.

303
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,300
As it's an important round, you can watch many special performances too.

304
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,070
I'm curious about the special performances.

305
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,900
As this is the final round, we have special hosts.

306
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,230
Please come out!

307
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,470
- Hello. - Hello, we are the winner of...

308
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,600
- K-Pop Star 2, AKMU. - AKMU.

309
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,170
- It's nice to meet you. - Scream!

310
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,630
(AKMU)

311
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,230
It's nice to meet you.

312
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,900
Four years ago, we were here.

313
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,100
We won K-Pop Star four years ago.

314
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,930
I feel overwhelmed.

315
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,930
- You must be very nervous. - No, I'm not.

316
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,370
- Not at all. - You seem really nervous.

317
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,270
As this is the final round, there will be amazing performances.

318
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,630
The legendary performances that were ranked high in music charts...

319
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,430
and made K-Pop Star popular. Do you want to see them again?

320
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,170
- Yes! - Yes!

321
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,700
The six trainees who once competed against one another...

322
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,040
formed a group together. They will perform here tonight.

323
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,670
Also, the previous contestants who grew up so much...

324
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,700
will give a touching performance. Please look forward to it.

325
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,130
The winner of K-Pop Star 6 will be decided soon.

326
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,470
Everyone, your choice will...

327
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,430
- decide the winner. - That's right.

328
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,900
The final round will begin shortly.

329
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,600
Your choice will decide the winner.

330
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,830
I already said that. I'm sorry.

331
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,500
You can vote by sending a text message.

332

Press the hash key and 0606.

333
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,000
Type the team's name in Korean.

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,900
Or you can simply type the team's number.

335
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,040
Please note that you can also vote on the music website.

336
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,770
The final round of K-Pop Star...

337
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,330
will begin now.

338
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,630
It will begin with the performance of number one, KWINs.

339
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,470
You can start voting...

340
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,830
- right now. - Right now.

341
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,470
(The voting begins now.)

342
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,070
(Number 1, KWINs, number 2, Boyfriend)

343
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,270
(Vote for the team you love.)

344
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,130
(This is Chrisha Choo when she was 9 years old.)

345
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,670
When I was five years old,

346
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,540
there were a lot of DVDs of concerts at home.

347
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,730
I watched the videos and they fascinated me.

348
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,070
I wanted to become a singer.

349
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:52,070
You watched concert videos instead of cartoons at the age of five?

350
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,200
Yes, I did.

351
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,400
They were fascinating.

352
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,770
This is Kim Hye Rim. She's in sixth grade.

353
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,270
My teacher and my parents suggested me...

354
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,700
to participate in singing contests for children...

355
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,100
since I was in fourth grade.

356
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,230
So I participated...

357
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,900
in "Who's Great?" when I was 13...

358
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,540
and received an award. It let me have confidence in myself.

359
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,040
That experience really encouraged me to dream to be a singer.

360
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,830
I loved singing...

361
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,800
and dancing since I was seven.

362
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,370
I started to dreaming to be a singer who appears on television.

363
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,100
(Three members of KWINs have the same dream.)

364
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,470
(Now they will perform together in the final round.)

365
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,870
What does K-Pop Star mean to your life?

366
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,100
It's our very first stride.

367
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,000
For the first time,

368
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,600
we met other trainees and practiced to perform on the stage.

369
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,070
It's where our efforts to be a singer have begun.

370
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,430
(Hee Yeol is startled as he finds out the song selection of KWINs.)

371
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,430
(Gosh.)

372
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,770
I can hardly picture it.

373
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,400
It's a good choice.

374
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,870
It's great.

375
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,930
(Which song has Queens chosen? Why did the judges react differently?)

376
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:38,370
(A powerful duo performance, "Trouble Maker")

377
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,040
That's for a coed duo, right?

378
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,900
I can't get rid of the image of the original performers from my head.

379
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,600
Will the three girls be able...

380
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,970
to successfully reinterpret the performance?

381
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,040
I think they made the best choice in this final round.

382
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,130
Through this song,

383
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,570
they can show everything they have from singing, dancing,

384
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,100
ability to interpret the song, accuracy, flexibility...

385
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,270
and even their talents.

386
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,470
I think this performance will be their best one.

387
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,800
Boyfriend has earned a high score...

388
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,400
and is garnering great attention now.

389
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,830
We thought we should choose a challenging song...

390
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,470
in order to weaken their upturn.

391
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,830
(KWINs selected a challenging performance for the final round.)

392
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,430
We will show you how much...

393
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,970
our dancing and singing skills have improved.

394
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,330
We will show you everything we have...

395
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,230
and what we are capable of.

396
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,670
(KWINs)

397
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:59,300
("Trouble Maker" by Trouble Maker)

398
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,930
(Music Producer Kwon Tae Eun, Band Master Lee Jeong Hun)

399
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,430
(Number one, KWINs. Kim So Hee, Chrisha Choo, and Kim Hye Rim)

400
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,400
The first performance of the final round is over.

401
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,830
It was "Trouble Maker" by KWINs.

402
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,600
- Thank you. - Thank you.

403
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,570
All right. They said thank you. What do you think, Jin Young?

404
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,700
After they performed "Swing Baby"...

405
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,330
in the previous round,

406
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,330
I told you that Chrisha Choo was the only one who stood out.

407
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,570
And when you performed "Wannabe",

408
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,830
the only one who captured my eyes was Hye Rim.

409
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,500
And today,

410
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,070
So Hee stood out the most.

411
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Thank you.

412
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:43,430
When you started dancing to the sound of clockwork,

413
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,100
you totally captivated my heart.

414
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,400
And the dance you showed during the dance break...

415
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,570
was gorgeous.

416
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,100
You proved once again...

417
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,830
why I picked you as the best dancer of this whole season.

418
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,330
I mentioned that your voice was smaller compared to others...

419
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,230
because you tended to be careful when you sing loudly.

420
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,030
You've finally overcome it.

421
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,800
- Thank you. - For the first time,

422
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,270
- your singing was loud and fine. - Thank you.

423
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,570
You all showed your talents, accuracy, flexibility,

424
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,370
feelings and basic skills very well.

425
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,670
JYP's score is...

426
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,300
He highly complimented the performance.

427
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,200
Let's see what score they got from JYP out of 100.

428
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,230
- It's 96. - Thank you!

429
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,930
It's a very high score. Hui Yeol, please.

430
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,370
I think their performance was very significant.

431
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:50,300
It was the third performance you showed as KWINs, right?

432
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,730
I realized how important...

433
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,730
the chemistry of each member...

434
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,300
and teamwork are.

435
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,570
I could hardly find flaws in your performance.

436
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,030
I think you now know what each other's strengths are.

437
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,530
Your voices really made my ears feel comfortable.

438
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,230
You fully understood the different charms of your voices...

439
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,200
and managed to divide the parts in a clever way.

440
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,530
Although you three have different tones,

441
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,600
it was very harmonious.

442
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,400
No matter who sings the music,

443
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,130
music exists to be listened by others.

444
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,400
As your voices were stable, I really enjoyed the music.

445
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,470
And your dancing and performance was very natural.

446
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,670
I almost thought you guys are professional singers.

447
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,500
It was quite flawless.

448
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,230
However, it wasn't as explosive as I expected.

449
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,570
Antenna's score is...

450
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,800
Let's see how many points the girl group expert gave to KWINs.

451
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,100
Antenna's score is...

452
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,870
- 96 points! - Thank you!

453
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,000
He not only said the performance was seamless...

454
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,100
but also gave a very high score.

455
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,730
Hyun Suk, please.

456
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,200
Hui Yeol hasn't...

457
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,700
produced or directed any girl idol groups.

458
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,770
Did you have to say that?

459
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,070
- But Jin Young and I have. - Right.

460
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,000
So I think we have a different point of view.

461
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,600
I didn't mean to belittle him. I'm sorry.

462
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,630
I seriously love girl groups.

463
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,730
Okay.

464
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,730
- He's an expert. - All right.

465
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,230
There's a reason why I mentioned it.

466
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,330
KWINs was formed only a few weeks ago.

467
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,070
Most of girl groups practice together for 3 to 4 years.

468
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,070
And those in our company practice up to six years.

469
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,230
I understand how hard it is to create a chemistry in a short time.

470
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,700
After I watched your last performance, "Swing Baby",

471
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,700
I realized that it was such a short period.

472
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,170
Jin Young and I saw the imperfections.

473
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,230
Today, like Jin Young said,

474
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,430
last week, So Hee was pretty much unnoticeable.

475
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,200
Strategy and teamwork is very important,

476
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,300
but I also think you need a star player.

477
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,130
Today, So Hee did very well as the star player.

478
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,630
Thank you.

479
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,530
It was like a well-dribbled ball...

480
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,570
was passed well with a great assist and So Hee scored a goal.

481
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,830
I liked your performance very much. Well done.

482
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,330
- Thank you. - Thank you.

483
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
- What's YG's score? - YG's score is...

484
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,000
So Hee's getting a lot of praise. YG's score is...

485
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,870
97 points!

486
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,030
- Thank you. - Thank you.

487
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,530
That's a total of 289 points.

488
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,900
The judges gave them 289 points.

489
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,630
If you want KWINs to win, text the number 1 to 0606...

490
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,600
or type KWINs in Korean.

491
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,330
That was Kim So Hee, Chrisha Choo, Kim Hye Rim, KWINs.

492
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:10,130
(Trust me, I'm older than you)

493
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,470
(Even holding hands makes me happy)

494
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,300
When I was five, I just loved music and dance.

495
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,770
Whenever I heard music or saw a dance, I just copied it.

496
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,000
Back then,

497
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,070
I didn't think about becoming a singer or what I should do.

498
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,530
I just copied singers because I loved music.

499
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,230
(Jong Seob aged seven)

500
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,430
Both my mom and dad have music-related jobs.

501
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:53,000
I just watched and listened to them and learned music naturally.

502
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,830
How close to your dream do you think you are?

503
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,830
For me,

504
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,270
I'd rarely performed on stage before coming on K-Pop Star.

505
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,470
This competition helped me get used to performing in public.

506
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,870
I think I'm 60 to 70 percent on the road to reaching my dream.

507
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,800
If I'd need to take 10 steps to reach my goal,

508
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,300
I would say that all the experience so far...

509
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,530
has given me the strength to run at full speed from the starting line.

510
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,730
(Last week's Top 4 performance)

511
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,200
(The first bar gave everyone the thrills.)

512
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,300
When I sang "let's get it started in here,"

513
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,600
the audience started to cheer.

514
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,030
That was when...

515
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,100
I thought I really had to keep my wits about me.

516
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,330
I worked really hard.

517
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,600
To be honest, through my whole life,

518
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,930
it was the best ever performance I'd done.

519
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,200
(After the show)

520
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,330
That was so much fun.

521
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,470
I can't believe we got a three-digit score.

522
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,270
(Gasping)

523
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,270
How do you feel?

524
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,400
So happy.

525
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,500
Can you get another 100-point score?

526
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,470
If we do really well.

527
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,470
Yes, if we do really well,

528
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,470
I think we can.

529
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,600
(What song will they sing in the hope of getting 100 points?)

530
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,070
(G-Dragon's "Crooked")

531
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,000
The song we'll sing at the final...

532
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,630
is G-Dragon's "Crooked".

533
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,400
How big of an explosion can they create?

534
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,570
Can they really let it all out and go crazy?

535
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,130
If they do it differently,

536
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:46,200
and give a great interpretation that's unlike G-Dragon's,

537
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,370
then these two will really be...

538
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,970
incredible talents.

539
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,730
The rap will be different from what we did two rounds ago.

540
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,300
It's a different style.

541
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,470
A whole new level.

542
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,430
What will it be like?

543
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,870
The slow parts will sound almost melancholy.

544
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,570
It'll sound like the autumn sky.

545
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,400
(Boyfriend's on the rise.)

546
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,030
It will definitely sound different from what we did so far.

547
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,230
(Will they become the youngest ever winners?)

548
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,830
(Boyfriend)

549
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,830
("Crooked" by G-Dragon)

550
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,330
(Boyfriend)

551
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,370
That was "Crooked" by Boyfriend, our second finalist.

552
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,530
It's time to hear the judges' comments.

553
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,670
What will they say?

554
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,440
Let's start with Jin Young.

555
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,230
When I judge,

556
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,440
I have to focus on two sides.

557
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,500
The skill and capabilities of each individual,

558
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,330
and the whole performance.

559
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,630
First, I'll comment on each of you.

560
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,630
I've seen many singers and produced many singers.

561
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,130
To be this good at this age...

562
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:16,000
Even among the trainees in my agency,

563
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,970
it's very rare, you're that good.

564
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,500
To sing and dance like this at 11...

565
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,600
Now you reached the finals...

566
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,500
and Hyun Jin's singing has reached its peak.

567
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,800
You have a great voice and you sound so confident.

568
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,630
The flow of your rap, the way you followed the beat...

569
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,770
You're on the rise.

570
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,600
Also,

571
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,630
Jong Seob, when you rap, your voice is so clear.

572
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,130
Your delivery is great and the tone's so strong.

573
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:59,970
As individuals, your talents have reached a new high.

574
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,030
But as a whole, the performance was lackluster.

575
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,570
I know that...

576
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,730
it's hard for kids your age to keep planning performances like these.

577
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,300
It wasn't as great as I had hoped.

578
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,570
JYP's score is...

579
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,630
JYP's score.

580
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,170
Jin Young said that as individuals, you're definitely on the rise.

581
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,600
Out of 100...

582
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,100
- he gave 93. - Thank you.

583
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,130
Very well. Next up is Hyun Suk.

584
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,370
This is K-Pop Star's last broadcast.

585
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,030
If I look back on the last six years,

586
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,970
the success rate of those who sang Jin Young's songs was 90 percent.

587
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:47,230
The success rate of those who sang YG's songs was 10 percent.

588
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,900
I was concerned when I heard what song they'd chosen.

589
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,730
G-Dragon's "Crooked"...

590
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,300
G-Dragon performs at numerous concerts...

591
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,070
but this song has a little room for rearrangement.

592
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:05,070
When I saw how they rearranged the bridge part,

593
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,440
I was surprised.

594
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,440
It made me wonder why we didn't think of that.

595
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,470
It flew naturally.

596
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,070
Like what Jin Young said a while ago,

597
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:19,270
Hyun Jin's rap in the middle was very impressive.

598
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,270
He was in charge of singing for the most part,

599
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,330
so I was a little surprised when he rapped there.

600
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,970
I want to praise them highly...

601
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,600
for rearranging such a difficult song.

602
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,400
YG's score is...

603
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:38,200
He must've been very impressed by Hyun Jin's rap.

604
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,230
What's YG's score? It's 95.

605
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,570
- Thank you. - Thank you.

606
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,730
Next is Hui Yeol.

607
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,770
Last time,

608
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,700
I gave Boyfriend 100.

609
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,630
I added unnecessary comments,

610
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,970
but I will give a score that bears a symbolic meaning.

611
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,600
For people of their age,

612
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,800
they put on a shocking performance. I was really shocked.

613
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,130
Today, my standard was up here.

614
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,600
Given that, I was a little disappointed than the last time.

615
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,200
Nevertheless, I am constantly amazed.

616
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,170
Here's why. On Antenna Week,

617
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,170
I got to see them up-close for the first time.

618
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,330
And the shocking thing was...

619
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,400
that they can't tie their shoes yet.

620
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,970
- They are just kids. - They are kids.

621
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,470
But on the stage...

622
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,770
How can they put on such performance? I was shocked.

623
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,200
I can't stop thinking about...

624
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,200
what they will become in 10 years.

625
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,030
I was especially shocked by the rap in the middle.

626
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,230
There was a part in the middle where there were a few beats.

627
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,030
It would've been hard enough to fit a short rap in there.

628
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,500
And suddenly, he started rapping...

629
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,940
so fast like those auctioneers at Noryangjin Fish Market.

630
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,730
How can they do such thing at their age?

631
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,800
I am still amazed.

632
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,770
Jin Young used to say things like this so much...

633
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,830
and I always laughed at him for saying this.

634
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,770
But I think you will grow up and become K-Pop Star's future.

635
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,030
This performance convinced me.

636
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,330
Antenna's score Is...

637
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,230
All right. What score did Hui Yeol give?

638
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,230
- It's 97. - Thank you.

639
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,630
The total score is 285.

640
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,030
If you want Boyfriend to win,

641
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,230
text number 2 to 0606...

642
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,130
or type Boyfriend in Korean.

643
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,770
That was group number two, Boyfriend.

644
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,970
We watched the two teams' free song mission performances.

645
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,600
If we only consider the judges' scores,

646
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,500
KWINs is leading by four more points.

647
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,200
However, only half of the finals is done.

648
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,630
There's Round Two, so please continue watching.

649
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,830
K-Pop Star has been running for six years.

650
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,700
You must remember many performances.

651
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,570
A lot of the performances became an issue.

652
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:11,670
Jin Young, among all seasons, looking back on the last six years,

653
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,670
which contestant left the strongest impression?

654
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:21,300
Well, if I were to choose the most shocking moments,

655
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,400
I'd choose the moment when Lee Jin Ah played the piano...

656
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,630
- for the prelude of "My Own Way". - Okay.

657
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:32,330
I was really shocked when she played that line.

658
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,470
Also, in terms of drama...

659
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,200
The most dramatic moment was when Hyun Suk saved Katie Kim,

660
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,030
- who was almost eliminated. - He saved her.

661
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,130
"Place Where You Need To Be" was her next performance.

662
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,130
- And I was so shocked by it. - It's your song.

663
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,270
- Yes. - Yes.

664
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,700
- Well... - It's g.o.d's song.

665
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,500
It's g.o.d's song. Right. Okay.

666
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,100
Was that the most memorable performance?

667
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,170
And the song Sam Kim sang on a roof...

668
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,330
Wait, but that's my song too.

669
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,600
Sam Kim sang "You're the One" while playing a guitar on a roof.

670
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,370
That was shocking too.

671
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,400
- All right. - There were too many moments.

672
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,370
- Right. - Lee Soo Jung's...

673
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,570
- "Girl" was shocking too. - Right.

674
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,170
There are too many. Who do you remember, Hyun Suk?

675
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,100
Having seen Jin Young for six years, I realized...

676
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,630
that Jin Young loves himself so much.

677
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,300
- He's consistent. - He's very consistent.

678
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,940
The song Katie sang was originally sang by g.o.d.

679
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,600
- But Jin Young wrote it. - Right.

680
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
He's got a lot of good songs.

681
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,230
- Of course. - Yes.

682
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,200
It would be nicer if he doesn't say anything.

683
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,100
The most memorable performance for me was...

684
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,070
Perhaps I'm biased because she now works with me.

685
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:48,270
But the moment I first saw Lee Hi on Season One was memorable.

686
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,400
I remember being amazed by her unbelievably husky voice.

687
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,530
The second memorable moment was when AKMU,

688
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,970
who stammered just now.

689
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,600
They kept saying same things again and again.

690
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,770
When they sang the song "Don't Cross Your Legs",

691
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,130
I was pleasantly surprised.

692
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,900
They didn't originally sing that song.

693
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,630
They sang another song at first.

694
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,730
But we asked them to sing "Don't Cross Your Legs".

695
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,300
And their life changed forever.

696
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,330
How about you, Hui Yeol?

697
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:18,470
They introduced almost all the legendary moments.

698
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,800
But the most memorable moment for me was when...

699
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,770
Kwon Jin Ah came out with a guitar and sang "See-Through".

700
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,370
I also remember the moment when a nerdy boy...

701
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,830
came out and started singing an amazing ballad song.

702
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,270
It was when Jung Seung Hwan sang "I Want To Fall In Love".

703
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,500
- Yes. - I remember the two moments.

704
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,230
Why are you only talking about your artists?

705
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,700
- You all are very egocentric. - I have another one.

706
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,300
Park Ji Young's "Who's Your Mama" performance on Season Four.

707
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:47,870
- That's enough. - I am sorry.

708
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,270
I won't ask you anymore.

709
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,570
The reason why I asked them this is this.

710
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,030
On K-Pop Star, there have been...

711
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,470
many legendary performances which fluctuated music charts...

712
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,670
and were viewed millions of times.

713
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,530
Today, we will revisit those moments.

714
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,070
The touching legend stage...

715
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,230
will open now.

716
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,600
(Many performances shone K-Pop Star over the last 6 years.)

717
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,170
("I Want To Fall In Love" by Jung Seung Hwan)

718
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:23,770
(He sang it on Season 4.)

719
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,470
There's no singer who sings like that.

720
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,230
We need you in the music scene.

721
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,770
You are the first one who captured all our hearts...

722
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,570
with a Korean pop song.

723
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,070
Thank you.

724
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:46,600
("Place Where You Need To Be" by Katie Kim on Season 4)

725
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,230
I can't judge this.

726
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,230
That was the best performance so far in four years.

727
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,430
That's the place where you need to be.

728
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,070
That was the best.

729
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,970
100. She got 100.

730
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,430
What's this? We've never heard this before.

731
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:19,900
(Since December 2011, for the past 6 years,)

732
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,900
(many contestants made K-Pop Star shine brightly.)

733
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,070
(Those touching performances...)

734
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:56,830
(will be put on once again.)

735
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:01,400
(K-Pop Star's legendary performances begin now.)

736
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,570
Hello, we are a sibling acoustic duo,

737
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,370
- AKMU. - AKMU.

738
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,670
("Don't Cross Your Legs" by AKMU)
