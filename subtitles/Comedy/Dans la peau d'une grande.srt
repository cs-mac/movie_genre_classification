1
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:23,709
THE SOFT SKIN

2
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:16,626
CROSSING

3
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:38,751
I just called your office.

4
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:42,959
The subway broke down, not a cab in sight.

5
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:44,376
- Hello, Odile.
- Hello, Pierre.

6
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:47,126
- What's your departure time?
- I've got 40 minutes.

7
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:49,292
In this traffic? Never!

8
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:53,001
- I must try it, Franca.
- I've packed your suitcase.

9
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,292
- Hello, Daddy!
- Hello, princess.

10
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,542
- Will you take the car?
- If you come along to park it.

11
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:03,292
Only if you do the driving.
I make you too nervous.

12
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,542
It's my husband.

13
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:11,292
- It's a tie rack.
- Stop kidding.

14
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,167
What's up?

15
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,876
Pierre's late. He's lecturing in Lisbon.

16
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:18,501
- I can drive you.
- Franca will do it.

17
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:22,167
Go ahead, you're a much better driver.

18
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,126
That's right, he is.

19
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:28,834
Bye, princess.

20
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:30,251
Bye, Daddy.

21
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:31,959
Be good now.

22
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:35,001
Can I ride to the airport?

23
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,792
You know you can't.

24
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,417
Why not? She'll enjoy it.

25
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:40,542
Okay, you can come.

26
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:45,084
Mademoiselle,
would you get Sabine's coat, please?

27
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,876
Call to tell me where you are staying.

28
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,876
Here's an article about you.

29
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,042
I'll read it later.

30
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:55,834
Please be careful.
He can always catch another plane.

31
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,376
- What's the time?
- It's 3:45.

32
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:17,417
We'll never make it.

33
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,917
Is your talk on Stendhal?

34
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,709
No, on Balzac.

35
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,001
There's a speed limit, but what the hell.

36
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:37,501
A cop! If he's after us, we're sunk.

37
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:43,251
You just leave it to me.

38
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,167
Bye, Michel. Thanks.

39
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,001
- Porter?
- No thanks.

40
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,626
The Lisbon plane, can I still make it?

41
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,084
I'm not sure...

42
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,876
Mr Lachenay for the Lisbon flight?

43
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,876
<i>Let me check.</i>

44
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:26,709
They might have taken the ladder away.

45
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,542
<i>Check in Mr Lachenay's luggage.</i>

46
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,626
This way, please. Let's hurry.

47
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,084
They're taking the ladder away.

48
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,876
No, it's going back.

49
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,959
Let's hurry.

50
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,167
Quick, the door!

51
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:38,376
<i>Please fasten your seat belt,
and no smoking. Thank you.</i>

52
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,876
Seats forward, please.

53
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,626
Will you wait here, please?

54
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:28,001
We can go now.

55
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,667
A photo with the stewardess, please.

56
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:54,334
This way, Mr Lachenay.

57
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,251
Here's the bathroom.

58
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,584
Fine.

59
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,042
Perfect.

60
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,334
For you.

61
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,501
BALZAC AND MONEY

62
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:01,042
Why Balzac and money?

63
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:05,626
Well, I'm a fan of Balzac's
and I don't despise money.

64
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:11,959
But all joking aside, that happens to be
the title of one of my books.

65
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:15,751
How about a book on Balzac and love?

66
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,376
Why not?

67
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:20,459
There's a full house.

68
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:29,126
We'll need some extra seats.

69
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,126
- What's Ionesco up to?
- He's doing fine.

70
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,459
- We'd better go now.
- I'm ready.

71
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,709
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

72
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:51,459
As soon as I am through
with the introduction...

73
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:55,292
I know what to do. See you later.

74
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,334
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

75
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:07,792
<i>We've got a small problem
with the microphone.</i>

76
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,876
<i>I present you Pierre Lachenay.</i>

77
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,959
How about lunch tomorrow?

78
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:23,209
Sorry, I leave at noon.

79
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:24,751
What a pity.

80
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,834
Look, it's Pierre Lachenay.

81
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:32,376
We hope to see you in Paris very soon.
Goodbye.

82
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:08,084
Here's where I get off.

83
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,209
I'll call you.

84
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:12,709
Yes, tomorrow.

85
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:32,834
I forgot to ask you your floor...

86
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,376
That's quite all right.

87
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,084
I'm sorry.

88
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,667
Thank you, sir.

89
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,876
Would you ring room 813?

90
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,292
<i>Hold on.</i>

91
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,501
Hello, room 813?

92
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:02,209
Miss, I was in the elevator with you...

93
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,542
I wanted to apologise...

94
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,876
<i>Apologise for what?</i>

95
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,626
You got off at the 8th floor...

96
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,376
<i>Of course.</i>

97
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:14,584
Well, since I'd past my floor anyway,

98
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,667
and you had so many packages,

99
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,126
I should have helped you with them.

100
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:24,876
<i>Not at all. That's perfectly all right.</i>

101
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:29,209
Well, forgive me.

102
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,292
Look, I wonder...
Could we have a drink together?

103
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:33,834
<i>Right now?</i>

104
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,501
Yes, right now.

105
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,501
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

106
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,376
Oh, it's past 1 a.m.

107
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,501
<i>And the bar's closed.</i>

108
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,751
Then, could we have a drink tomorrow?

109
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:50,251
<i>There's really no point, you know.</i>

110
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,209
I see. I'm very sorry...

111
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,834
Good night. Please excuse me.

112
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,709
<i>Look, I didn't mean to be so rude.
It was very kind of you to call me.</i>

113
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,126
<i>Let's have that drink together.</i>

114
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,084
Fine. In the morning?

115
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:40,084
<i>No, I've got to go shopping.</i>

116
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,042
<i>Can we make it in the afternoon?</i>

117
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:44,959
Yes, of course.

118
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:47,584
<i>In the bar at 6:00?</i>

119
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,042
All right.

120
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,626
- <i>Good night.</i>
- You too.

121
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,501
Do you enjoy your work,
or do you dislike it?

122
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,584
I like my job.

123
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,459
I started a year ago.

124
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:39,459
They said I'd soon be fed up.

125
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,042
Maybe.

126
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,542
Many girls do quit after a few years.

127
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:46,251
What happens to them?

128
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:48,709
They get married.

129
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:52,959
I love my parents...

130
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:56,376
They live in Bordeaux.

131
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,292
That's where I'm from.

132
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:08,751
Papa used to say it's a job for a snob,
but now he doesn't mind.

133
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:13,459
- Don't you know her?
- Yes, I do.

134
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,042
They're friends of mine.

135
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:23,542
That's Frank.
He's the co-pilot of the plane you came on.

136
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:31,042
We almost met six months ago.

137
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:32,334
What do you mean?

138
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:37,751
I knew a TV writer
who worked with Louise de Vilmorin.

139
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:41,334
She had us to dinner once.
You were expected.

140
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:45,167
We waited, but you never showed up.

141
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:47,459
I just couldn't help it.

142
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:51,042
I haven't read all of your books.
In fact, I haven't read any.

143
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:55,834
But I've seen you on television.

144
00:17:56,167 --> 00:18:01,001
So, at the airport, I recognised you.

145
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:06,334
So Balzac decides
to put out a novel a month.

146
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:10,751
Not slim ones, mind you, but huge volumes.

147
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,834
He writes a chapter a day.

148
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:16,917
He can't live on what the publishers pay him,

149
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:20,376
so he buys his own printing plant.

150
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:25,876
But business is bad,
and his partners pull out.

151
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,626
He decides to do it all by himself,

152
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,459
casting his own type,

153
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:34,292
setting it himself,

154
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:38,084
even making his own paper.

155
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:42,917
But he loses everything,
including Madame de Berny's money.

156
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,542
Wasn't she his mistress?

157
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,084
Yes. I'll tell you how that came to pass.

158
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:52,542
Madame de Balzac wants
a wife for her son, HonorГ©.

159
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:56,042
Madame de Berny
has two daughters to marry off.

160
00:18:56,209 --> 00:19:00,042
HonorГ© meets the two young girls,

161
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,292
who leave him cold.

162
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:05,084
But he falls in love with the mother.

163
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:06,667
That's marvellous!

164
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,667
I've been talking for hours.

165
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,876
It was fascinating!

166
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:18,334
I'll lend you some books, if you'd like.

167
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,042
I didn't realise it was getting so late!

168
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:23,501
Look how kind these folks are.

169
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:27,501
In France, the boss would have
put us out hours ago.

170
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,876
I'll ask for the bill.
It must be daylight by now.

171
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:23,667
Coming, Madame.

172
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,792
Matches?

173
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,126
- Surprised?
- A little.

174
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:58,251
It was easy.

175
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:01,167
I called your secretary,
then your Lisbon hotel,

176
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:05,251
checked with the airport, and here I am!

177
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:11,959
Michel and Odile are coming over later.

178
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:15,251
I knew you'd be tired
but it was only possible today.

179
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,542
They are going to Japan.

180
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,334
How does one turn off this heater?

181
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:34,584
I guess we can turn that off.

182
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,751
- I hate sports programs.
- So do I.

183
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:44,667
The other day,
on the way back from the airport,

184
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:48,209
my car broke down on Saint-Denis Street.

185
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,709
What were you doing there?

186
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:52,584
Tell us all about it.

187
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:55,042
Not Saint-Martin, Saint-Denis.

188
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:58,709
I was just going to the Japanese art shop.

189
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,167
To buy some prints, I suppose.

190
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,042
You guessed right.

191
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:07,292
I meant to ask you...

192
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:09,542
- Ice cream?
- Yes, please.

193
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,667
Where you stay in Tokyo?

194
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,167
The Takanawa Hotel is pretty good.

195
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,376
- Listen.
- What is it?

196
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:18,876
That's Sabine.

197
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,501
I'll go this time.

198
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,376
Is it your first trip to Japan?

199
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:25,376
No, I already went there two years ago.

200
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:29,501
As soon as you put a cigarette
in your mouth, a woman lights it up.

201
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,626
What are you doing?

202
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:43,751
I'm looking for my book.

203
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,251
It's late. You should be fast asleep.

204
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,042
I have slept.

205
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:50,917
Yes, but not enough.

206
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:56,001
Back to bed, now.

207
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:58,751
Here.

208
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,292
And here.

209
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:06,917
That's enough, now.

210
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,084
I'm closing the door.

211
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,084
Open it more.

212
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,376
Is that enough?

213
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:14,792
A bit more.

214
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,167
No more than this.

215
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,917
They're going.
You might at least say goodbye.

216
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:15,292
So you're off to Tokyo?

217
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,917
Not yet. They are leaving next month.

218
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:21,251
See you at Suzanne's tomorrow.

219
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:22,876
Let's go together.

220
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,959
We'll see. I'll call you.

221
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:27,542
I can rely on you to call.

222
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,167
Have a good trip back.

223
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:32,292
Goodbye.

224
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:42,459
Were you bored?

225
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:43,959
No, I like them.

226
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:45,417
They're nice.

227
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:50,626
By the way, Kanayan called. He's furious.

228
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:52,292
Again?

229
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:55,292
What is it this time?

230
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:59,917
It seems that in the latest edition,

231
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:02,376
his article was put in last place.

232
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:05,917
He said, "I know it's petty",

233
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,501
"but as I'm from an underdeveloped country,"

234
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:15,084
"I've got a terrible inferiority complex."

235
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:19,251
I felt like quoting that joke...

236
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:23,501
"That's no complex, my dear,
you're really inferior!"

237
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,292
But that would be going too far.

238
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:31,376
Once you know him, he's really a nice guy.

239
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:36,792
Pierre LACHENAY, President
5th floor, left

240
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:42,084
- What about that call?
- The line's busy.

241
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,542
Can we do the mail now?

242
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:46,959
If you like.

243
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:58,167
For Mr Kanayan, 17 Street so-and-so.

244
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:00,667
My dear Kanayan.

245
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:05,084
You're decision to stop writing for us

246
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:09,209
is due to a misunderstanding...

247
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,209
No. I'll lunch with him instead.

248
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,001
- And the other letters?
- Later.

249
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,834
What about the calls?

250
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,042
I'll take these if they call back.

251
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,376
So I'm not calling anyone?

252
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:22,876
No one else.

253
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:25,709
And your appointment?

254
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,709
Yes, I remember.

255
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,209
- I'm going out.
- And your appointment?

256
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,542
I'll be right back.

257
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:19,084
When you called, I was on my way out.

258
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,959
When's a good time?

259
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:24,251
It's hard to say. My hours are so crazy.

260
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:27,251
I lose many friends that way.

261
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:30,917
People invite me, but they are never sure

262
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:34,251
I'll turn up, so they stop asking me.

263
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,334
Well, I'll never stop.

264
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,251
I'll always be there whenever you need me.

265
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,959
God, it's windy!

266
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:45,126
Do you have to go to the gym?

267
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:48,334
It's part of the refresher course.

268
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:50,376
What's that?

269
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:54,209
We practise first aid, safety drills

270
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:58,334
and how to handle lifeboats.

271
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:00,459
It's late, I must run.

272
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:28,626
- Guess what I've got!
- Something for me?

273
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,584
It's a record.

274
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:33,376
A little girl singing?

275
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,459
No, something nicer.

276
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:38,667
Haydn's Toy Symphony.

277
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:42,542
You hear toys and birds calls in the music.

278
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:45,001
Wait and listen.

279
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,501
It's lovely.

280
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:10,001
Where's the paper that was here?

281
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,126
I didn't touch it.

282
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,459
It's not here and I need it!

283
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:18,167
Let's see if it's up there.

284
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:23,501
It had a book review I meant to keep.

285
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,667
I'm sure it's around.

286
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:32,126
Here it is.

287
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:36,209
This isn't the one, God damn it!

288
00:32:36,376 --> 00:32:38,584
Calm down.

289
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,917
Our news dealer can get it for you.

290
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,126
I want it right now!

291
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:47,167
Is that so?
Well, get your lousy paper yourself!

292
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,834
I love you.

293
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:34,001
Ever since knowing you,
I've become a new man,

294
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:38,209
one who cannot conceive
of living without you. I love you.

295
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:45,126
Are you coming or going?

296
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:49,042
We take off in half an hour.

297
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,209
I'm taking the bus. Are you coming with me?

298
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:57,042
Catherine, please, I've got to see someone.

299
00:34:57,584 --> 00:34:59,876
All right, bye.

300
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:08,584
You're still here?

301
00:35:09,584 --> 00:35:13,959
I saw a plane take off
and assumed you were on it.

302
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:17,417
Lots of planes take off from here, you know.

303
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:21,042
They're changing a wheel,

304
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,209
so we're delayed.

305
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,751
Are you asleep?

306
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:23,376
You're mean!

307
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,876
I'm sorry I carried on so about that paper.

308
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:44,334
It wasn't that urgent.

309
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:47,751
Besides, I found it 10 minutes later.

310
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:05,251
Let's go away for a few days.

311
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:09,834
We haven't been alone together for years.

312
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:12,917
Sabine could stay with Odile.

313
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:15,376
What do you think?

314
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:18,167
A few days in the country?

315
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,876
Maybe. We'll see.

316
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:41,542
Hello, Mr Lachenay.
How is Madame Lachenay?

317
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:43,001
She's fine.

318
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,292
The menu.

319
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:18,667
- Did you wait for me yesterday?
- Yes, you were late.

320
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:19,917
What happened?

321
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:23,167
A snowstorm in Frankfurt. I'm sorry.

322
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:27,334
Next time we're held up, I could cable you.

323
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:28,917
Or call my office.

324
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:31,209
What about your secretary?

325
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,001
It doesn't matter.

326
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:34,917
I didn't expect you.

327
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,084
Glad?

328
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,167
Yes, I was feeling blue.

329
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:42,959
Here's a present.
You can use it to make notes

330
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,292
during your lectures.

331
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:47,042
Thank you.

332
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,334
I'm most pleased.

333
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,667
Can I sleep at your place?
I'm not expected home.

334
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:05,292
Look, I hate to say no,

335
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:07,584
but I'm scared

336
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:10,292
of the concierge.

337
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:15,584
Besides, the landlady's
an old friend of my parents.

338
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:20,126
No one's ever spent the night there.
We can't.

339
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,001
Don't be angry.

340
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:25,584
I want to stay with you, too.

341
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,709
I understand.

342
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:32,209
Why don't we sleep some place else?

343
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:35,751
All right. First, I'll pick up a dress.

344
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,792
Then, a nice restaurant.

345
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,251
A place where we can dance?

346
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,959
Choose a place.

347
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:49,667
I warn you, I don't dance.

348
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,001
I never learned how.

349
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:56,001
Even when you were... I mean...

350
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:59,001
Yes, even when I was young.

351
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:02,209
That made it hard to find a wife.

352
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:03,751
Don't be silly!

353
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:08,292
Go ahead, dance.

354
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:09,917
What will you do?

355
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:11,917
I'll just look at you.

356
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:14,167
That will be my pleasure.

357
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:12,084
LUXURY STUDIOS
OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY

358
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,834
- A room please.
- No reservation?

359
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:50,542
Sorry, not now.

360
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:55,626
You can go upstairs.

361
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:02,084
But I'll have a room in 15 minutes.
Can you wait?

362
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:04,417
Fifteen minutes?

363
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:11,751
Please, Pierre, let's go.

364
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,084
Of course.

365
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,876
Disappointed?

366
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,959
No, I felt the same way.

367
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:37,792
I'd no idea it would be so sordid.

368
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:41,292
We need a place of our own.

369
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:44,501
I'll take you home.

370
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,709
- I'm off now.
- One more kiss.

371
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:26,084
Listen.

372
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:29,834
We'll be careful. Come on up.

373
00:43:30,084 --> 00:43:31,126
Come.

374
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:50,251
I'll go first.

375
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:53,876
It's too risky.

376
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:55,876
You'd be worried.

377
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:58,209
There's another way. When do you leave?

378
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:02,209
In two days. I'll be back Monday.

379
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:07,834
Next week, I've got a lecture in Reims.
You'll come along.

380
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:12,251
We'll have two whole days on our own.

381
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,126
That'll be wonderful.

382
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,334
Paris is no good for us.

383
00:44:16,501 --> 00:44:19,376
Yes, you're right.

384
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:23,834
Think of me.

385
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:32,959
Where are you going now?

386
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:34,417
Home.

387
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:37,084
I'll tell my wife I just got back.

388
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:42,251
I don't want you to go there.

389
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:15,042
What's the matter?

390
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:18,376
Just looking at your blue jeans.

391
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:21,084
You disapprove?

392
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:26,251
Well, I prefer you in dresses.
Did you bring any?

393
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:27,584
Of course.

394
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:30,042
Great.

395
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:32,001
We need gas.

396
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:33,626
Here?

397
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,667
Fill it up, please.

398
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:04,042
50 francs.

399
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:56,834
Look at your picture!

400
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,917
Are you giving a lecture in Reims?

401
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:08,001
No, I'm to present a film AllГ©gret
made before Andre Gide's death.

402
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:13,251
I accepted only so that we can have
two days together.

403
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:19,959
Look up the hotels in Reims.

404
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,917
The Grand Hotel's the best.

405
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,792
The sponsors will be at that one.

406
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:35,584
What's next?

407
00:48:35,959 --> 00:48:39,459
Next, The Lion d'Or.

408
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:44,209
That might be risky too.

409
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:48,584
The Michelet just has rooms.

410
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:51,792
We can eat out. Where is it?

411
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:55,501
It's Place Michelet in Reims.

412
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:57,084
A room for two.

413
00:48:57,251 --> 00:49:01,792
Did you make a reservation?
Number 12 is a double.

414
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:03,792
Does it have a bathroom? We'll take it.

415
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:05,834
Any luggage? I'll show you the way.

416
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:21,042
Excuse me, Madame. I'll go first.

417
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:29,209
It's very quiet here.

418
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:31,167
Thank you. That's for you.

419
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:36,376
A nice little room. Michelet's a good name.

420
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:39,376
I'd better unpack and bathe.

421
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,084
There goes my last pair!

422
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:48,417
I'd better run over
and let them know I'm here.

423
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,542
I won't be long.

424
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:54,626
I need stockings and a ticket for tonight.

425
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:23,334
<i>Don't forget my stockings!</i>

426
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:27,376
- Hello, sir. Any luggage?
- No luggage.

427
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:36,042
- Your suite is all ready.
- No need, I can't stay.

428
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:37,751
We'll take care of your luggage.

429
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:40,001
- Do you want to rest?
- I'm not staying.

430
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:43,209
- How are you, old man?
- Fine and you?

431
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:45,917
Want to freshen up first?

432
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,626
I'm all right.

433
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:51,959
When I invited you, I was sure you'd refuse.

434
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:55,292
But they know we're friends, so I had to try.

435
00:50:55,459 --> 00:50:56,876
Is your wife here?

436
00:50:57,042 --> 00:50:58,209
She's in Paris.

437
00:50:58,376 --> 00:50:59,542
Give her my best.

438
00:50:59,709 --> 00:51:02,376
Let me introduce you.

439
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:05,209
Father Cote, our welfare chairman.

440
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:06,626
Pleased to meet you.

441
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:09,751
Mr Bertrand, our theatre manager.

442
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:12,417
Madame Leloix's in charge of...

443
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:14,292
Cultural exchanges.

444
00:51:14,459 --> 00:51:16,001
Tonight's affair.

445
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:21,084
Our cultural director and his wife.

446
00:51:29,126 --> 00:51:30,792
Why the dinner?

447
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:33,084
Didn't you know?

448
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:36,376
Out here we squeeze a celebrity dry,
like a lemon.

449
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:38,751
I must get my car fixed.

450
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:40,626
- Will you be long?
- Five minutes!

451
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:43,751
Okay, I'll keep them busy with the canapГ©s.

452
00:51:45,126 --> 00:51:46,334
Hurry back!

453
00:51:52,751 --> 00:51:55,542
<i>Don't forget my stockings...</i>

454
00:51:55,709 --> 00:51:57,001
<i>Zibeline...</i>

455
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:22,334
NEAMAT STOCKINGS

456
00:52:39,084 --> 00:52:41,001
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, we're closing.

457
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:43,376
I'd like to buy some stockings.

458
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:55,667
I bought you two pairs.

459
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:59,834
There are complications... A dinner for me.

460
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:03,751
Then I'll eat next door, but stay a while.

461
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:07,459
Impossible. They're all waiting for me.

462
00:53:07,626 --> 00:53:09,001
All right, never mind.

463
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,667
You understand, don't you?

464
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:12,584
See you later.

465
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,417
My ticket!

466
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:19,084
Just buy one at the theatre.

467
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:20,292
Which one?

468
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:23,251
- The Capitol, I think.
- But where is it?

469
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:26,126
Ask the hotel people.

470
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:29,167
I wonder why I'm here.

471
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:49,251
- You brought it back?
- They're too busy.

472
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:52,209
I swear that if it were me... Come on.

473
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:57,417
You're at the head of the table,
a lady on each side.

474
00:54:01,126 --> 00:54:03,001
Are you married?

475
00:54:03,209 --> 00:54:04,251
I am.

476
00:54:04,459 --> 00:54:06,376
Why isn't your wife with you?

477
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:08,292
My wife's home.

478
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:11,334
Oysters or potage, take your choice.

479
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,709
Do you know Reims?

480
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:16,834
Any children?

481
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:18,626
A real interview!

482
00:54:19,584 --> 00:54:22,667
I'll answer you one by one.

483
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:24,834
I have a child.

484
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:28,334
I've never been here.

485
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:31,417
And you're leaving tonight?

486
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:33,751
What about the smile of Reims?

487
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:37,751
Only AndrГ© Gide could get me
back to the movies.

488
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:41,126
Last time was to see Charlie Chaplin.

489
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:45,876
To fix a clock,
he opened it with a can-opener.

490
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:49,959
I first saw the sea at Paramount.

491
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:53,542
Last month, we had Daninos.
You know him?

492
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:56,959
Not personally. How was it?

493
00:54:57,376 --> 00:54:59,167
It was awful!

494
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:05,084
Everyone was late, it rained,
and my dress was a disaster.

495
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:07,334
- Was it the colour?
- No.

496
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:11,959
It made me look terribly fat.
The affair was a real disaster!

497
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:15,626
Don't worry if our public seems cold,

498
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:17,209
we never applaud.

499
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:20,459
Did you know Gide?

500
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:24,167
- He sells books.
- I also happen to admire Gide.

501
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,542
I met him twice,

502
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:30,667
the second time, shortly before his death.

503
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:32,251
Tell us about it.

504
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:37,876
I'd rather save it for my speech
so as not to repeat myself.

505
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:39,667
As you like.

506
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:45,251
A young lady to see you, sir.

507
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:50,876
Are you sure?

508
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:06,959
I'm sorry to bother you,
but since I can't stay for your talk,

509
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:10,626
would you autograph this book for me?

510
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:12,417
Of course.

511
00:56:13,709 --> 00:56:16,751
My name's Christiane Duchant.

512
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,501
With a that's right.

513
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:23,459
Thank you very much.

514
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:26,209
He doesn't let anyone walk over him.

515
00:56:26,376 --> 00:56:30,792
Next year, it'll take us 72
minutes to go to Paris by train.

516
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:34,292
Excuse me.

517
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:49,001
I must check the box-office.

518
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:08,376
Thank you for coming, Mr Lachenay.

519
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:12,834
Thanks to you, we're sold out.
A rare event in this movie crisis!

520
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:17,834
Forgive me if I'm blunt,
but I'm a businessman.

521
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:23,042
Tonight's big turnout isn't for Gide,
it's for you!

522
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:25,042
They've seen you on TV.

523
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,001
Time to go.

524
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:29,001
This way.

525
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:33,876
Take this.

526
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:40,501
I must leave you now to check the hall.

527
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,501
See you later at the reception.

528
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:46,459
I'm sorry, I can't stay for it.

529
00:57:46,626 --> 00:57:50,084
I must be back in Paris tonight.

530
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:53,042
What a pity. Thanks again for coming.

531
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:55,709
And good luck!

532
00:58:04,459 --> 00:58:06,001
Put your coat down.

533
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:12,459
I make a quick announcement.

534
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:14,959
We turn the lights on.

535
00:58:15,126 --> 00:58:17,001
Then you walk on.

536
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:22,251
We shake hands. Then you're on your own!

537
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:23,709
All right.

538
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:30,334
Shall I go?

539
00:58:34,084 --> 00:58:38,751
The friendship of a great man is a godsend.

540
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:42,876
There's no need
to introduce Pierre Lachenay.

541
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:47,709
But I'd like to thank him
for coming here tonight.

542
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:01,251
Ladies and gentlemen,

543
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:06,126
I've learned that men's unhappiness arises
from the inability

544
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:09,751
to stay quietly in their own room.

545
00:59:10,042 --> 00:59:13,792
Had I recalled this a few hours ago,

546
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:17,084
I wouldn't be here now. Frankly,

547
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:18,876
I'm rather nervous.

548
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:22,042
I'm not a cinema expert,

549
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:26,292
but I had the great pleasure
to meet Andre Gide twice.

550
00:59:27,126 --> 00:59:28,542
One ticket please.

551
00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:30,667
No more seats.

552
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:34,584
- The balcony?
- We're all sold out.

553
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:37,959
Can I stand inside if I pay?

554
00:59:38,126 --> 00:59:39,834
That's impossible.

555
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:43,584
- Really?
- Absolutely. I'm sorry.

556
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:48,084
This lady insists on going in.

557
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:52,834
All seats were sold out in advance.

558
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:54,792
You can close up now.

559
00:59:55,501 --> 01:00:01,542
Everybody has read or held a book
from the famous PlГ©iade collection

560
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:05,292
which publishes the entire work
of an author in one tome.

561
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:10,042
Gide got the idea for this collection

562
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:12,751
by reading the Bible.

563
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:14,959
He said, "My dear Lachenay",

564
01:00:16,084 --> 01:00:20,001
"our talk today will help you read my books."

565
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:23,917
"Am I the man required?"
I reassured Andre Gide.

566
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:30,292
But time flies... In conclusion,

567
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:35,709
I should like to read
a few of Gide's final words.

568
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:38,459
"I offer no doctrine,"

569
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:41,042
"I refuse to give advice"

570
01:00:41,209 --> 01:00:44,334
"and I shy away from discussions."

571
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:48,251
"But I know that many today are searching"

572
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:50,542
"for someone to believe in."

573
01:00:51,292 --> 01:00:53,376
"To them, I say,"

574
01:00:53,626 --> 01:00:56,376
"trust those who seek the truth,"

575
01:00:56,751 --> 01:01:01,209
"beware of those who've found it,
question everything,"

576
01:01:01,376 --> 01:01:03,876
"but believe in yourself."

577
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:11,167
And now, Marc AllГ©gret's film.

578
01:01:14,459 --> 01:01:15,917
Great speech!

579
01:01:16,084 --> 01:01:18,584
- You think so?
- Really. It was perfect.

580
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:22,126
Listen, in playing this,

581
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:27,084
your fist concern is to generate emotion...

582
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,084
Our friend Gide is great.

583
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:32,209
- He looks like a wrestler.
- True.

584
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:35,876
Not merely your own,
but for others as well.

585
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:37,667
Now, do it again.

586
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:41,751
No, just from this part on.

587
01:01:47,209 --> 01:01:49,376
Do you want to see the rest?

588
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:51,251
Not really.

589
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:54,209
Let's have a drink.

590
01:01:58,917 --> 01:02:01,709
Can you imagine me a provincial...

591
01:02:04,959 --> 01:02:09,709
buried out here?
But I've kept my studio in Paris.

592
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:20,167
Did you forget something?

593
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,376
Let's go.

594
01:02:42,209 --> 01:02:45,251
You talked but I'm thirsty.

595
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:47,959
Bertrand should have a bar in his theatre...

596
01:02:48,126 --> 01:02:50,542
- Let me pass.
- Don't run away like this.

597
01:02:50,709 --> 01:02:53,209
But he won't listen to me.

598
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:57,959
After 9:00,
it's tough to get a drink around here.

599
01:02:58,709 --> 01:03:02,251
There was a place, but it's closed now.

600
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:05,792
The owner had a fight with the cops.

601
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:07,542
Do you want one?

602
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:11,626
Nothing doing out here,

603
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:15,042
but inside those walls, who knows?

604
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,542
You remember that girl,

605
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:22,459
the recluse of Poitiers?

606
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:26,084
I think there's a place nearby.

607
01:03:26,376 --> 01:03:29,584
I've been there once, a month ago.
Shall we go in?

608
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:31,626
Friends first.

609
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:41,417
What do you want? I'll have a beer.

610
01:03:44,084 --> 01:03:45,334
Two draught beers.

611
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:47,167
It'll limit the damage.

612
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:50,584
The film runs over an hour.

613
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,167
Cigarette?

614
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,334
What's wrong?

615
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:43,584
Too hot in here.

616
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,459
You seem upset.

617
01:04:50,209 --> 01:04:53,917
ClГ©ment, let's get out of here.

618
01:04:55,334 --> 01:04:57,667
You do look awful.

619
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:01,042
Can I finish your beer?

620
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:13,917
Let's go back to the hotel.

621
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,042
A little nap will do you good.

622
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:23,751
You'll be peaceful in your room.
Those jerks would demoralize anyone.

623
01:05:24,001 --> 01:05:28,251
Getting you here
is like throwing pearls to swine!

624
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:31,501
Your speech was really great and I mean it.

625
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:36,876
In fact, all your work is first-rate.

626
01:05:37,042 --> 01:05:41,626
All they do here is eat!
Lachenay in Reims? Presto, a dinner!

627
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:45,126
They eat their heads off for free!

628
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:47,834
That's why they go for culture.

629
01:05:48,584 --> 01:05:50,709
Damn that shoelace.

630
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:54,584
I'll try and fix it. It's
the second time tonight.

631
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:58,167
To every man, his own woes.

632
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,459
Mine's shoelaces.

633
01:06:00,626 --> 01:06:04,792
I hate them, so I always wear moccasins.

634
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:08,167
But I put my best shoes on, in your honour,

635
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:13,626
and they're killing me!
You might say I'm caught in a pinch!

636
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:18,417
Remember Lachere's wedding?
At noon, the bride hadn't even turned up.

637
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:26,501
What are you doing here?

638
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,876
That's a good question.

639
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:33,334
Forgive me, I've got to shake that pest.
I won't be long.

640
01:06:51,209 --> 01:06:53,167
I couldn't figure out where you'd gone.

641
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:57,084
You vanished into thin air,
like a flying saucer.

642
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:59,417
To quote the defeated general,

643
01:06:59,584 --> 01:07:03,792
"I searched high and low and all around me,"

644
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:08,542
"at a loss to know
what happened to my army."

645
01:07:08,709 --> 01:07:10,334
God, you look awful!

646
01:07:10,834 --> 01:07:15,001
This town shuts down at 9 p.m.
In Spain and Italy,

647
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:18,167
people stay out half the night.

648
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:24,626
In France, we're so stingy,
we go to bed early just to save electricity.

649
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:26,667
You look really tired.

650
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:29,542
You'd better have a nap at the hotel.

651
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:32,626
I'll pick you up for the reception.

652
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:34,792
I'm not staying for it.

653
01:07:34,959 --> 01:07:39,167
Do they know?

654
01:07:40,251 --> 01:07:41,417
They'll be sore as hell.

655
01:07:41,584 --> 01:07:44,959
Not at all. I told them about it.

656
01:07:45,126 --> 01:07:46,584
I didn't know that.

657
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:49,417
In that case, I don't have to go either.

658
01:07:49,834 --> 01:07:52,667
- Are you driving to Paris?
- Right now.

659
01:07:52,834 --> 01:07:54,959
Great! Take me along.

660
01:07:55,334 --> 01:07:57,459
- To Paris?
- Yes, I'll go with you.

661
01:07:57,626 --> 01:07:58,667
All right.

662
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:01,126
Is your car here?

663
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:05,417
I'll get my bag, wait here.
And bye-bye everyone!

664
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,501
Only be a minute!

665
01:08:53,084 --> 01:08:57,792
Get dressed. Let's get out of here.
This town is getting on my nerves.

666
01:08:59,584 --> 01:09:01,584
We're leaving!

667
01:09:06,459 --> 01:09:07,917
Nicole, did you hear me?

668
01:09:08,084 --> 01:09:10,376
Go if you want to. I'll stay.

669
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:12,542
What do you mean?

670
01:09:13,834 --> 01:09:15,626
I mean I'm fed up.

671
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:18,501
Don't you want to go?

672
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:20,251
Go yourself!

673
01:09:22,001 --> 01:09:25,417
I'll take a train to Paris in the morning.

674
01:09:25,584 --> 01:09:28,001
Just leave me alone.

675
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,084
Go away!

676
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:35,834
I didn't ask to come. It
was entirely your idea.

677
01:09:37,584 --> 01:09:40,292
And then you're ashamed of me.

678
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:43,126
It was all so humiliating.

679
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:48,959
That creep trying to pick
me up in the street.

680
01:09:51,126 --> 01:09:53,751
I felt humiliated too.

681
01:09:54,126 --> 01:09:56,959
But what could I do? I was trapped.

682
01:09:57,709 --> 01:10:00,709
It's been a real nightmare.

683
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:04,042
Please forgive me, my darling.

684
01:10:06,626 --> 01:10:08,709
You want us to stay here tonight?

685
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:15,001
No, let's leave right away.

686
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:18,209
I'll run down to pay the bill.

687
01:10:29,584 --> 01:10:30,876
The bill, please.

688
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:36,376
Right now? They're all asleep.
I can't do bills. Wait till morning.

689
01:10:36,542 --> 01:10:39,834
Sorry, but I must leave now.

690
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:42,376
I'll help you with the bill.

691
01:10:42,876 --> 01:10:44,792
We'll work it out.

692
01:10:45,251 --> 01:10:46,917
How much for the room?

693
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:48,084
40 francs.

694
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:52,542
Add a few extras... That's about 80 Francs.

695
01:10:52,709 --> 01:10:54,084
Here's 120!

696
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,417
Anyway, you've got my address.

697
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:58,792
Let me carry your bags.

698
01:10:58,959 --> 01:11:00,917
Never mind. We'll manage.

699
01:11:09,084 --> 01:11:13,334
Damn it, we have to pass the Grand Hotel.

700
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:15,834
See that guy?

701
01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:17,917
With the tan coat?

702
01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:19,751
God!

703
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:24,792
He says, "I'll go too!"

704
01:11:24,959 --> 01:11:26,626
What did you do?

705
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:31,376
I was stunned, but when he went inside,
I ran off like a thief.

706
01:11:33,751 --> 01:11:35,376
Crazy, isn't it?

707
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:41,709
Forgive me.

708
01:11:42,209 --> 01:11:44,209
Sacha Guitry said,

709
01:11:44,376 --> 01:11:46,167
"When they yawn,"

710
01:11:46,334 --> 01:11:48,501
"it's time to say bye-bye."

711
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:53,876
- Is the ColiniГЁre good?
- According to the guide, yes.

712
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:56,542
They say it's a nice inn
with separate cabins.

713
01:11:56,959 --> 01:11:59,542
That's right, come closer, darling.

714
01:11:59,959 --> 01:12:01,001
Go to sleep.

715
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:34,626
Forgive me.

716
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:39,501
Here's the bathroom.

717
01:12:41,501 --> 01:12:43,251
Do you need anything?

718
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:44,667
No, thank you.

719
01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:14,167
You asleep?

720
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:20,709
You're tired.

721
01:14:57,917 --> 01:15:00,292
When my brother bet

722
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:03,251
he'd shave his head with his electric razor,

723
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:07,417
Papa told him not to come back
till his hair grew in.

724
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:09,084
So he left home.

725
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:11,209
And why did you leave?

726
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:13,251
To take the airline job.

727
01:15:14,417 --> 01:15:17,917
- How'd you get it?
- By passing a test.

728
01:15:18,084 --> 01:15:21,084
I know a little Spanish,
I studied English in London.

729
01:15:21,376 --> 01:15:22,709
Well, nearby. For a year.

730
01:15:22,876 --> 01:15:25,792
- Any friends there?
- Not at first.

731
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:29,792
I was homesick,
but my parents made me stay.

732
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:34,292
- Later, I made friends.
- Why couldn't you go home?

733
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:38,876
In Bordeaux, I'd had a crush on a boy

734
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:41,084
and my parents wanted me to forget him.

735
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:43,459
Was he your first?

736
01:15:45,084 --> 01:15:47,001
No, the first was in London.

737
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:48,501
An Englishman?

738
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:50,084
No, a Frenchman.

739
01:15:50,876 --> 01:15:52,626
Did you love him?

740
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:56,709
No, it was silly, it didn't last.

741
01:15:57,667 --> 01:15:58,709
And after him?

742
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:03,792
Two or three. They didn't mean anything.

743
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,042
I was too young, I guess.

744
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:12,584
But the first time it mattered physically
was last year.

745
01:16:12,876 --> 01:16:17,001
I didn't want him, but he was always around.

746
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:20,376
Finally, he almost raped me.

747
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:24,292
It's strange. He thrilled me,

748
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:27,959
yet, I didn't love him.

749
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,917
It didn't last very long.

750
01:16:32,084 --> 01:16:36,042
I felt squeamish, as if I'd been soiled.

751
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:40,334
When I got home, I'd take a bath.
It was ridiculous.

752
01:16:40,501 --> 01:16:44,876
I even hated the clothes he'd touched.

753
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:47,542
What did he do for work?

754
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:54,751
Gosh, this is heavy!

755
01:16:55,501 --> 01:16:57,167
Is he in aviation?

756
01:16:57,334 --> 01:16:59,709
Yes, a pilot. You've met Frank.

757
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:02,459
I knew it!

758
01:17:02,626 --> 01:17:06,584
I sensed it before our dinner in Lisbon.

759
01:17:08,459 --> 01:17:09,751
And when we met?

760
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:11,084
There was no one.

761
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:12,251
And Frank?

762
01:17:12,376 --> 01:17:15,626
I broke off with Frank months ago.

763
01:17:15,876 --> 01:17:17,417
- Others?
- No one at all.

764
01:17:18,626 --> 01:17:22,501
I like to make love,
yet I can go without for months.

765
01:17:23,751 --> 01:17:25,459
Do you mind me talking about it?

766
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:26,792
Are you sure?

767
01:17:26,959 --> 01:17:30,751
I don't really know Frank,
but I hate his type.

768
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,459
What do you mean?

769
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:34,834
He's too sure of himself.

770
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:36,792
Not really,

771
01:17:37,126 --> 01:17:41,334
but I don't care enough to defend him.
Anyway, why talk about Frank?

772
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:46,834
Wait!

773
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:31,584
In profile.

774
01:18:31,751 --> 01:18:33,001
Look at me.

775
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,376
One more.

776
01:18:38,126 --> 01:18:40,042
I don't like your legs like that.

777
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:41,417
Don't cross them.

778
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,334
Let me show you.

779
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:49,501
Like this.

780
01:18:52,209 --> 01:18:53,251
There.

781
01:19:09,459 --> 01:19:11,751
My legs hurt!

782
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:14,001
One more with the automatic shutter.

783
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:19,959
Now, you and me together.

784
01:19:29,459 --> 01:19:32,167
See, I'm lucky at games.

785
01:19:39,626 --> 01:19:42,917
Have you always been
so interested in women?

786
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:47,917
Funny, it's only since I've known you.

787
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:51,001
I must be stimulating.

788
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:55,959
Where do you go in summer?

789
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:57,709
My kids love Brittany.

790
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:13,334
The cleaner can get it out.

791
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:17,959
Look, Pierre.

792
01:20:19,709 --> 01:20:21,542
See that woman?

793
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:25,042
I used to be a blonde, real cute!

794
01:20:25,626 --> 01:20:27,001
You don't believe me?

795
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:29,292
Now, look there.

796
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,084
What do you see?

797
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:41,001
The same blouse.

798
01:20:41,167 --> 01:20:42,542
Right.

799
01:20:43,334 --> 01:20:44,334
Leopard skin.

800
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:51,542
Women who wear them like making love.

801
01:21:01,626 --> 01:21:04,626
There's something wrong. What is it?

802
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:07,001
Nothing.

803
01:21:07,751 --> 01:21:11,709
I know you. I can tell you're worried.

804
01:21:12,126 --> 01:21:13,376
Something I did?

805
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:16,626
Something I said?

806
01:21:18,376 --> 01:21:19,542
It's awkward...

807
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:30,292
I know, you've got to call your wife.

808
01:21:31,376 --> 01:21:32,417
That's it.

809
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:35,667
Couldn't you just say so?

810
01:21:37,334 --> 01:21:38,792
I'll be outside.

811
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:41,209
Tell me when you're finished.

812
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:48,126
Connect me with Passy 42-70.

813
01:21:59,209 --> 01:22:01,584
You're all right, Franca?

814
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:03,001
<i>Yes, and you?</i>

815
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:06,459
I'm fine, but something came up.

816
01:22:06,626 --> 01:22:10,292
They wanted a repeat performance

817
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:14,251
so I had to stay over. I'll be home tonight.

818
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:17,376
<i>You calling from Reims?</i>

819
01:22:17,876 --> 01:22:19,001
Yes, Reims.

820
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,667
<i>Really? I called Reims two nights ago</i>

821
01:22:21,834 --> 01:22:24,709
<i>and was told you'd just left for Paris.</i>

822
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,334
I'll call you tomorrow.

823
01:22:57,292 --> 01:22:58,709
Do you love me?

824
01:23:00,251 --> 01:23:01,292
Yes.

825
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:03,709
Why won't you say it?

826
01:23:06,584 --> 01:23:10,042
Because you don't like to spell it out,
is that it?

827
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:13,542
That's it exactly.

828
01:23:19,876 --> 01:23:21,667
Don't forget me.

829
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:39,792
I know you were with a girl.

830
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:43,167
Answer me.

831
01:24:45,292 --> 01:24:50,792
Kanayan told me his article
wouldn't be ready in time.

832
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:53,042
So I called the hotel in Reims,

833
01:24:54,001 --> 01:24:55,792
you'd left the night before.

834
01:24:56,876 --> 01:24:59,751
You were driving, I became frantic.

835
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:01,251
As if you care!

836
01:25:01,709 --> 01:25:03,584
How could you treat me that way?

837
01:25:03,751 --> 01:25:04,834
Listen, Franca.

838
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:08,001
Was that asking too much,
a few days with you?

839
01:25:08,334 --> 01:25:11,834
We could have gone off
right after the lecture.

840
01:25:12,417 --> 01:25:14,501
I've waited for five years.

841
01:25:14,667 --> 01:25:16,167
You exaggerate!

842
01:25:16,334 --> 01:25:18,042
No, I've counted them.

843
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:21,542
I was upset. I needed to be alone.

844
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:24,167
If you'd only said that to me.

845
01:25:24,334 --> 01:25:27,126
You'd never understand it!

846
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:28,417
Not so loud.

847
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:31,209
Sabine never wakes up.

848
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,917
Maybe not, but the nurse is here.

849
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:38,667
After all, I might want to go out.

850
01:25:39,084 --> 01:25:40,542
I need some fun too!

851
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:45,084
Franca, I'm tired.

852
01:25:45,251 --> 01:25:48,459
So am I, but it's high time we talked.

853
01:25:50,917 --> 01:25:51,959
Say something!

854
01:25:53,584 --> 01:25:55,459
If I'm wrong, say so.

855
01:25:55,667 --> 01:25:58,334
I'm not up to talking just now.

856
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:00,334
If there was a woman, tell me.

857
01:26:00,501 --> 01:26:03,167
It would hurt far less if I knew.

858
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:07,667
- I was alone!
- I don't believe you.

859
01:26:07,834 --> 01:26:09,001
I don't care!

860
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:10,251
Thanks a lot!

861
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:13,584
You expect me to be kind? In what way?

862
01:26:13,834 --> 01:26:15,167
Be considerate.

863
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:17,542
What for? You're not sick.

864
01:26:17,709 --> 01:26:19,417
Yes, thanks to you, I am sick!

865
01:26:20,084 --> 01:26:21,667
I haven't slept in two nights.

866
01:26:28,126 --> 01:26:30,834
Pierre, maybe we should separate.

867
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:34,376
I'm serious.

868
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:36,709
All right, I'll go.

869
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:46,667
I didn't mean all that.

870
01:26:47,459 --> 01:26:49,542
I'm upset. I was nasty.

871
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:54,209
Look, I propose we try an experiment.

872
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:58,334
No fighting for a month.
After that we decide.

873
01:26:59,001 --> 01:27:01,126
We've experimented for years.

874
01:27:01,501 --> 01:27:03,709
I won't forgive this.

875
01:27:54,376 --> 01:27:55,501
Hello, Dominique.

876
01:27:56,834 --> 01:27:58,376
Yes, I slept here.

877
01:27:58,917 --> 01:28:02,209
- How did you get your flat?
- The Chaude Agency.

878
01:28:02,376 --> 01:28:05,792
Better call them, I've got to find a flat.

879
01:28:06,459 --> 01:28:08,584
I'm going out for coffee.

880
01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:12,459
Madame Lachenay.

881
01:28:14,126 --> 01:28:15,709
I'll take it in there.

882
01:28:23,126 --> 01:28:24,834
<i>Did you sleep well?</i>

883
01:28:25,251 --> 01:28:27,709
<i>Well, I was up all night.</i>

884
01:28:27,876 --> 01:28:31,584
<i>This is just to thank you
for walking out on me.</i>

885
01:28:31,751 --> 01:28:33,876
<i>I'd forgive anything but that.</i>

886
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,876
<i>Odile's cousin will act as my lawyer.</i>

887
01:28:37,042 --> 01:28:39,417
- As what?
- <i>My divorce lawyer!</i>

888
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:43,084
<i>I suggest you get someone too.
Why waste time?</i>

889
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:44,959
<i>I won't be alone long.</i>

890
01:28:45,126 --> 01:28:49,001
<i>Your bags are all packed.
Pick them up any time.</i>

891
01:28:56,667 --> 01:29:01,126
I called your office, but you'd gone.

892
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:04,417
You can't stay. My father's in town.

893
01:29:04,584 --> 01:29:08,334
He's on his way here.
And I'll be away till Friday.

894
01:29:08,626 --> 01:29:12,667
Let's have dinner Friday.
I've got important news.

895
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:15,376
Important? Tell me now.

896
01:29:15,542 --> 01:29:18,376
No, you're rushed and this takes time.

897
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:20,459
Come on,

898
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:24,667
you tell me you've got big news
and now you won't talk. Tell me.

899
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:26,834
Nothing doing!

900
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:30,792
Just tell me if it's something pleasant.

901
01:29:31,501 --> 01:29:35,542
I'm not sure. But it is
serious and important.

902
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:37,376
What is it?

903
01:29:38,126 --> 01:29:40,834
I meant to explain it properly.
It's just this...

904
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:46,334
My wife and I are separating
by mutual agreement.

905
01:29:48,876 --> 01:29:50,084
Listen,

906
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:53,251
there's my dad, you'd better run.
See you Friday.

907
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:56,542
We won't meet at the airport, but here.

908
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:57,917
All right.

909
01:30:11,376 --> 01:30:12,584
Excuse me, sir.

910
01:30:20,834 --> 01:30:23,126
- Hello, daddy!
- Hello, darling.

911
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:24,792
I'm almost ready.

912
01:30:34,959 --> 01:30:37,834
See, I walk like a lady.

913
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:57,584
My lawyer's waiting to hear from yours.

914
01:30:57,751 --> 01:30:59,459
It's not that urgent.

915
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:03,376
Yes, it is. I don't like
ambiguous situations.

916
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,417
We can't talk here.

917
01:31:05,584 --> 01:31:08,167
Then let's go to the study.

918
01:31:21,126 --> 01:31:22,459
Sit down.

919
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:24,334
I'd rather stand.

920
01:31:25,251 --> 01:31:27,167
I'm taking this one.

921
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:31,667
That one too.

922
01:31:34,042 --> 01:31:36,376
Your bags are ready, they're in the hall.

923
01:31:37,167 --> 01:31:40,001
I didn't know where to send them.

924
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:42,834
Where do you live?

925
01:31:43,084 --> 01:31:45,042
I sleep in the office.

926
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:47,917
I plan to take a flat.

927
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:49,084
You fool!

928
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:51,417
- Listen Franca!
- I won't listen.

929
01:31:51,792 --> 01:31:55,376
What got into you? Weren't you happy here?

930
01:31:57,959 --> 01:32:00,167
- What's got into you?
- Not in front of the girl.

931
01:32:00,334 --> 01:32:02,667
Now he thinks about her.

932
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:04,917
Go play with Mademoiselle.

933
01:32:05,209 --> 01:32:07,917
Sabine, go and see Mademoiselle.

934
01:32:08,959 --> 01:32:10,167
Come here, Sabine!

935
01:32:12,292 --> 01:32:14,042
Kanayan called.

936
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:18,001
I gave him the office number. You were out,

937
01:32:18,751 --> 01:32:20,709
so he rang here.

938
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:24,584
I told him you weren't living here any more.

939
01:32:25,376 --> 01:32:27,584
What else could I tell him?

940
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:30,834
The truth. We decided to separate.

941
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:33,292
We decided to separate!

942
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:35,876
You'd like me to say that.

943
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:37,626
Don't count on it.

944
01:32:37,876 --> 01:32:39,959
I'll say that you left me.

945
01:32:40,126 --> 01:32:42,792
Isn't it true? You were fed up?

946
01:32:42,876 --> 01:32:43,959
Calm down, Franca.

947
01:32:44,042 --> 01:32:46,917
You're a louse!

948
01:32:49,209 --> 01:32:50,959
Forgive me, Pierre.

949
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,459
I didn't mean to do that, but I'm so tired.

950
01:32:56,584 --> 01:32:58,542
Come here, sit by me.

951
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:03,334
I'm sorry for all I said.

952
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:06,042
You must loathe me.

953
01:33:06,209 --> 01:33:09,376
No Franca, I loathe myself.

954
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:11,751
Kiss me.

955
01:33:44,209 --> 01:33:45,917
We'll play in your room.

956
01:33:48,334 --> 01:33:50,876
This will go to the cleaner.

957
01:34:20,084 --> 01:34:21,917
I'm taking her out.

958
01:34:22,084 --> 01:34:23,542
Bye, darling.

959
01:34:24,126 --> 01:34:25,584
Bye-bye, daddy.

960
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:28,917
Come on, we're leaving.

961
01:34:38,084 --> 01:34:39,834
They probably forgot something.

962
01:34:44,042 --> 01:34:46,709
I'd better come back later.

963
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:50,042
No, stay here. Anyway, Pierre's leaving.

964
01:34:52,209 --> 01:34:53,792
I must be going.

965
01:34:53,959 --> 01:34:56,042
Call me tonight. I'd like that.

966
01:34:56,209 --> 01:34:58,167
Really?

967
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:03,126
You got some Champagne from Reims.

968
01:35:03,876 --> 01:35:06,167
Just keep it in the cellar.

969
01:35:09,751 --> 01:35:11,626
Here's the Foujita.

970
01:35:12,001 --> 01:35:14,084
What for? I gave it to you.

971
01:35:14,251 --> 01:35:15,709
Take it back.

972
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:18,334
I don't want it, it's yours. Keep it.

973
01:35:26,709 --> 01:35:29,709
Want to come back for supper, or to sleep,

974
01:35:31,001 --> 01:35:32,626
or just for supper?

975
01:35:32,792 --> 01:35:37,417
It won't work, you know,
with all that's happened.

976
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:54,209
I'm sorry, Odile.
I can't go with you, I don't feel well.

977
01:35:55,709 --> 01:35:57,417
What a fool I am!

978
01:35:57,584 --> 01:35:59,792
I should have known better.

979
01:35:59,959 --> 01:36:02,209
What's Pierre done to you?

980
01:36:02,376 --> 01:36:04,084
What did he want?

981
01:36:07,751 --> 01:36:09,876
That's what he wanted!

982
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:23,209
Top luxury apartment block
Ready for AUTUMN 64

983
01:36:23,376 --> 01:36:26,292
Franca, you've got to calm down.

984
01:36:26,459 --> 01:36:28,501
You need some sleep.

985
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:31,459
Let me have a sleeping pill?

986
01:36:39,209 --> 01:36:41,334
You said you'd be right down.

987
01:36:41,501 --> 01:36:45,251
I'd better stay.
Franca's very upset over Pierre.

988
01:36:45,334 --> 01:36:48,751
I'm afraid she might do something foolish.

989
01:37:14,959 --> 01:37:19,292
In the plane today, we ran into a storm.

990
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:22,584
One of the passengers,
an American, was scared.

991
01:37:22,667 --> 01:37:25,917
He drank so much whisky,

992
01:37:26,001 --> 01:37:30,459
he went berserk.
He drove us all crazy, it was real wild!

993
01:37:30,626 --> 01:37:33,751
Don't talk so loud, people are staring.

994
01:37:34,584 --> 01:37:36,584
You're charming tonight.

995
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,334
Did your dad enjoy Paris?

996
01:37:46,292 --> 01:37:48,001
Did he have a good time?

997
01:37:49,376 --> 01:37:50,667
I don't know.

998
01:37:51,126 --> 01:37:53,251
I'm tired. Please take me home.

999
01:37:54,334 --> 01:37:57,876
Why? The programme starts in 10 minutes.

1000
01:37:59,959 --> 01:38:01,334
Take me home.

1001
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:04,167
You were so eager to come here.

1002
01:38:05,751 --> 01:38:08,959
Well, now I'm tired. I leave tomorrow.

1003
01:38:11,001 --> 01:38:12,084
Mad at me?

1004
01:38:15,334 --> 01:38:16,376
You're sure?

1005
01:38:18,042 --> 01:38:19,876
Positive.

1006
01:38:26,709 --> 01:38:31,542
I wasn't very good company, I know,
but you must understand,

1007
01:38:31,834 --> 01:38:34,251
I've had a pretty rough week.

1008
01:38:34,459 --> 01:38:36,792
Franca, the separation...

1009
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:40,917
I thought you both wanted this separation.

1010
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:43,459
Yes, of course,

1011
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:47,334
but it's not so easy after 15 years.

1012
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:49,209
You told her about me?

1013
01:38:49,376 --> 01:38:53,792
No. I thought the later, the better.

1014
01:38:54,084 --> 01:38:55,501
I don't agree.

1015
01:38:55,667 --> 01:39:00,709
If it was me, I'd prefer the
truth even if it's another girl.

1016
01:39:01,584 --> 01:39:03,126
You know the score.

1017
01:39:03,292 --> 01:39:05,209
I didn't see it that way.

1018
01:39:05,751 --> 01:39:07,376
Speaking as a man,

1019
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:10,667
I tell you, it's a mistake.

1020
01:39:12,459 --> 01:39:17,417
You may be right.
I'll tell her, but it won't be easy.

1021
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:21,126
You see, it's been hard on me too,

1022
01:39:22,001 --> 01:39:23,834
harder than I thought.

1023
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:26,042
We're used to each other,

1024
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:30,876
and there's Sabine.
I'll miss seeing her every day.

1025
01:39:32,209 --> 01:39:35,459
If that's how it is, you sure goofed!

1026
01:39:37,501 --> 01:39:40,876
You can give Sabine
some calves liver for lunch...

1027
01:39:41,126 --> 01:39:43,917
I'll get the door!
And some mashed potatoes.

1028
01:39:46,209 --> 01:39:48,584
The suit from the cleaner's.

1029
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:50,126
Hold on.

1030
01:39:52,917 --> 01:39:56,501
We found this stub in the pocket.

1031
01:39:56,667 --> 01:39:58,376
Thank you.

1032
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:07,209
PHOTO ENLARGEMENT

1033
01:40:16,959 --> 01:40:20,001
This is the living room.

1034
01:40:22,626 --> 01:40:25,542
There, my study and the library.

1035
01:40:27,917 --> 01:40:30,376
That will be our room,

1036
01:40:31,459 --> 01:40:33,501
with Sabine's next to it
for when she visits us.

1037
01:40:33,667 --> 01:40:36,376
I'll get an extra room for the nanny.

1038
01:40:39,876 --> 01:40:41,542
So you want to marry me?

1039
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:45,876
If I say yes, you'll talk to my father.
Is that it?

1040
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,042
Listen to me,

1041
01:40:51,376 --> 01:40:54,792
I've discovered some facts of life lately.

1042
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:57,584
There's a misunderstanding.

1043
01:40:58,084 --> 01:41:00,042
When you looked me up in Paris,

1044
01:41:00,126 --> 01:41:04,876
I was pleased because
I thought you might misjudge me

1045
01:41:05,042 --> 01:41:07,167
after what happened in Lisbon.

1046
01:41:09,084 --> 01:41:11,792
On the way here, I guessed...

1047
01:41:13,334 --> 01:41:17,084
But now that it's out, I've got to speak up.

1048
01:41:18,792 --> 01:41:22,626
It's just as well you brought it to a head...

1049
01:41:22,792 --> 01:41:24,626
it was all happening too quickly.

1050
01:41:25,751 --> 01:41:31,751
Because it just would have dragged on
to wind up the same way.

1051
01:41:32,626 --> 01:41:34,292
What's the point?

1052
01:41:35,542 --> 01:41:37,626
In the restaurant last night,

1053
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:41,376
I irritated you, I could tell.

1054
01:41:41,709 --> 01:41:43,376
You almost hated me.

1055
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:44,542
It's true.

1056
01:41:47,209 --> 01:41:50,709
To plan a wedding when you reach
that point, it makes no sense!

1057
01:41:53,209 --> 01:41:56,459
I know you're hurt. I feel bad, too.

1058
01:42:00,126 --> 01:42:05,792
If you'd like, we could
meet from time to time.

1059
01:42:13,417 --> 01:42:15,251
I'm truly sorry.

1060
01:42:17,751 --> 01:42:19,084
Bye, Pierre.

1061
01:43:34,042 --> 01:43:36,084
- How much is it?
- 14 francs.

1062
01:44:35,126 --> 01:44:37,209
Need some help?

1063
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:40,334
How about a little walk?

1064
01:44:41,834 --> 01:44:44,042
Why hurry home?

1065
01:44:53,209 --> 01:44:56,917
We can go to a cafГ© or up to my place.

1066
01:44:57,209 --> 01:44:59,251
Who the hell are you?

1067
01:44:59,417 --> 01:45:01,292
What are you after?

1068
01:45:01,459 --> 01:45:05,876
Do all women go for you?
You take them to the country?

1069
01:45:06,042 --> 01:45:09,709
Irresistible, a Don Juan...

1070
01:45:09,876 --> 01:45:12,542
God's gift to women?

1071
01:45:13,001 --> 01:45:16,042
Ever take a good look at yourself?

1072
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:17,876
Come and have a look.

1073
01:45:18,084 --> 01:45:19,667
- Look again!
- Leave me alone!

1074
01:45:41,959 --> 01:45:44,292
Take Sabine to Madame Odile's.

1075
01:45:44,459 --> 01:45:47,209
Look Mummy, I've finished it all off!

1076
01:45:47,376 --> 01:45:49,251
After her homework?

1077
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:51,126
No, right after she eats.

1078
01:45:51,292 --> 01:45:52,626
And the homework?

1079
01:45:53,292 --> 01:45:55,459
She'll do it at Madame Odile's.

1080
01:45:55,626 --> 01:45:56,667
All right, Madame.

1081
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:24,626
A token, please.

1082
01:48:48,084 --> 01:48:49,126
Odile?

1083
01:48:52,626 --> 01:48:54,876
I want to thank you for everything.

1084
01:48:55,209 --> 01:48:58,084
I'm off for a rest tomorrow.

1085
01:48:58,959 --> 01:49:01,959
Ask Franca, can I see Sabine before I go?

1086
01:49:02,126 --> 01:49:05,751
<i>As you wish, Pierre. But it's such a mess.</i>

1087
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:10,334
What can I do about it now?

1088
01:49:11,001 --> 01:49:12,542
It's too late.

1089
01:49:14,751 --> 01:49:17,751
Since you'll be seeing her,

1090
01:49:18,959 --> 01:49:20,167
would you let me know?

1091
01:49:20,584 --> 01:49:22,334
Let you know what?

1092
01:49:24,209 --> 01:49:27,167
If you can still change your mind?

1093
01:49:28,584 --> 01:49:32,042
If you really want to go back to Franca,

1094
01:49:32,334 --> 01:49:35,876
<i>I'm sure she'd agree if you ask her yourself.</i>

1095
01:49:36,042 --> 01:49:38,376
You may be right, Odile.

1096
01:49:39,959 --> 01:49:41,459
I'll do it next week.

1097
01:49:41,626 --> 01:49:45,542
<i>Why? The sooner the better.
Call her right now.</i>

1098
01:49:45,709 --> 01:49:47,001
Now?

1099
01:49:47,709 --> 01:49:51,126
I'd rather wait awhile.

1100
01:49:51,292 --> 01:49:55,626
<i>What for?
Do you think she'll sit around for 10 years?</i>

1101
01:49:57,001 --> 01:50:00,209
<i>Pierre, I beg you, don't put it off.</i>

1102
01:50:00,751 --> 01:50:02,917
You're probably right.

1103
01:50:04,751 --> 01:50:06,376
I guess I'll do that.

1104
01:50:17,376 --> 01:50:18,776
- Another token, please.
- One more?

1105
01:50:18,917 --> 01:50:20,292
That's right.

1106
01:51:45,584 --> 01:51:46,709
I'm going out.

1107
01:51:46,876 --> 01:51:48,709
Will you lunch here?

1108
01:51:48,959 --> 01:51:50,834
No, I'm not eating here.

1109
01:52:31,042 --> 01:52:32,959
Madame Lachenay's place.

1110
01:52:34,542 --> 01:52:36,334
Is this you, Mademoiselle?

1111
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:40,209
- My wife, please.
- <i>She just this minute went out.</i>

1112
01:52:42,042 --> 01:52:44,126
Look in the hall.

1113
01:52:44,709 --> 01:52:47,126
Hold on, sir. I'll see.

1114
01:53:00,167 --> 01:53:02,376
No, she's left the house.

1115
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:06,376
<i>Then she's in the street.
Call her from the window.</i>

1116
01:53:06,542 --> 01:53:08,209
I'll have a look.

1117
01:53:39,084 --> 01:53:43,876
I'm sorry, but her car just pulled out.
Any message?

1118
01:53:44,417 --> 01:53:48,792
Tell her that I phoned and
will call back later.

1119
01:53:48,959 --> 01:53:50,667
<i>I'll tell her, sir.</i>

1120
01:53:50,834 --> 01:53:51,876
That's all.

1121
01:56:49,459 --> 01:56:52,042
Call the police!
