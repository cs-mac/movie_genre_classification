Shut up, missi.

Why are you in my house

Uh, actually,
I made her dinner.

God! Nice, Greg.

You have to cheat
with the neighbor.

And you can forget about me

You... for being an asshole.

That's what I'm suing you for.

That's not even
what a pattern is.

that repeat themselves on and
on, sometimes into infinity.

you have to take it easy.

00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,164
Honestly, for the night
as a whole,

794
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,367
it wasn't the worst thing
that happened.

795
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:53,036
Do I say "thank you"
to that?

796
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,471
Yeah, there's a compliment
in there.

[ Chuckling ] I don't know.
In there somewhere?

[ Moaning ]
Oh, God.

Don't look.
Oh! Oh, God!

00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,311
I just told you not to look!
Why did you look?!

801
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,113
[ Groans ]
I tried
to save you from that.

802
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:07,551
Because by saying it,
it's like an invitation to look.

803
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,453
I mean,
it's like if somebody says,

804
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:10,620
"does this smell weird
to you?"

805
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:14,324
And they put it out,
you lean in and you smell it.

806
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,293
You don't smell it.
But you do.

807
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,461
You lean in
and you smell it.

808
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,663
All right, that's crazy.
I-I would not smell something

809
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,431
if somebody told me
not to smell it.
You would.

810
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,233
I can guarantee you.
I can guarantee you that.

811
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,069

Oh. Dad,
all right, enough!

to mom!

817

It's complicated.

Yeah, you think?
I think so.

Hey, grandma!
Uh, uh...

Come on, dad.
He's married.

I'm sorry,
but he is an asshole.

I-I agree. He's a little bit
of an asshole.

oh, God.
[ Sighs ]

827
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,531
Look, will you do me a favor?
My mom is home alone

828
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,533
and she's sick and I need
to get back with her.

829
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,735
So do you have, like,
a pen or something

830
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,670
that I could borrow
real quick?

831

Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.

at a certain point,

I'll come pick him up, okay?

in my right mind for many years

1105

because of the drinking,

1106
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,378
and when I realized
that I'd stepped over the line

1107
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,547
where I was
actually thinking of

1108
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:27,150
sleeping with my own
daughter's husband,

1109
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:31,154
well, then I just didn't know
what could happen.

00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:35,892
And... That's why I left.

We're charging her
with possession of oxycodone.

Well, she's got prescriptions
for everything.

She's old.

1126

She had 32 oxycodone pills,

1127
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,864
and they were not prescribed
to her.

1128
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,465
Judge set her bail
at $3,000.

We don't have
that kind of money.

to get out of there now.

Glen's got diabetes.

Diabetes is a very
manageable condition.

about Glen.

I'm sorry. I don't.
I don't know you.

My grandma needs to get out
of there now.

Then you better get
$3,000.

supposed to do that?!

"thank you."

"you're welcome."

No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:01,263
Oh, my gosh.
You're a little sweaty.

1572
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:02,264
I know.
You're dancin' hard.

1573
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:03,999
Well, I-I'm... I'm killing it
on the dance floor.

Let's just try
to glow less.

a shirt and pants.

Is that what
I'm kind of smellin'?

Why did I do that?
I told you.

1626

Because I told you,

'Cause I'm tricky.

I actually don't think
you're tricky.

1634
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:12,160
I think you're kind of
a straightforward person.

That's one of the things I like
about you a lot.

It was really nice.
Of course.

But, I mean,
anybody would've done it.

No, not really.

Really beauties.
You're done. You're done.

1726
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:10,331
Hey! Hey!
You're done.

1727
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:11,032
What the fuck did you do?

1728
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:12,667
All right, go get me
another drink right now.

1729
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:14,669
Damn it, you said
you weren't gonna drink.

1730
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:15,803
Oh, I said
I wasn't gonna drink.

1731
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:16,938
Now you get me a drink.
Come on.

1732
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,973
Oh, uh, may I introduce
my granddaughter,

1733
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,708
a hamburger...
what are you doing?

1734
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:24,679
Cheeseburger, sorry.
She's actually cheeseburger.

1735
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:27,482
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
What? What?

1736
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:29,684
Don't tell me what to do.
Just get off it.
Get off this.

1737
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:33,354
I don't want some fat loser
telling me what to do.

1738
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:34,622
You're just being
an asshole

1739
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,658
because you're drunk
and it's not okay.

1740
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,792
Hey, w-we're all drunk,
Tammy.

1741
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,427
She didn't mean anything
by it.
Lenore: Pearl...

1742
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:40,628
pearl: No, I absolutely
do mean it.

1743

I-I totally understand.
I don't blame Greg.

1744

I w...
I would leave her, too.

1745

I mean, I wouldn't want to have
anything to do with her.

1746

Look at her.
Come on, everybody, people.

Oh. What?
What?

1749
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,379
At least I didn't try to fuck
my daughter's husband.

1750
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:01,316
How'd you know
about that?

1751
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:02,450
Fuck you.
What?

1752
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:05,653
Always something,
right? With her.
Fucking drunk.

Lenore:
Okay, we're havin fun.

1754

All right,

Earl: All right, pearly.
Why's everybody being so quiet?

1756

Here we go. Here we go.
What? What? All right.

01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,731
What did I say?
What did I say?

1758
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:19,033
Thank you, 'sanne, everybody.

1759

Whoa!
Whoa.

1760
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:25,440
Lenore: There you are.

1761
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:30,445
I've been looking
all over creation for you.

1762
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:36,784
Quite a show
you two put on.

1763
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:39,454
I didn't start anything.

01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:42,623
Well, you sure finished it,
though, didn't you?

1766
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:43,591
What was I supposed to do?

1767
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:47,762
Just stand there while
she said shitty things to me?

1768
01:12:47,764 --> 01:12:48,529
It's not fair.

1769
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,565
What the hell does fair
have to do with it?

1770
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:53,568
I got a big news flash
for you, Tammy.

1771
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,369
Life isn't fair.

1772
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:55,803
You're gonna have to scrape
and claw

1773
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:59,140
for everything you want,
just like the rest of us.

1774
01:12:59,142 --> 01:12:59,941
You know, for years,

1775
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,410
you've been bellyachin'
and complainin'

1776
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:03,111
about how your life sucks,

1777
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:06,948
but you haven't done one
single thing to make it better.

1778
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:07,849
It isn't magic, you know?

1779
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:11,519
You can't just bitch and moan
and expect shit to change.

1780
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:14,922
You think this house
just fell on my head one day?

1781
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:15,790
I had to work hard.

1782
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:19,794
You know, gay hasn't always
been in fashion, my friend.

1783
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:23,531
Susanne and I...

1784
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,936
If you had any idea how hard
we had to work...

1785
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:34,976
We didn't have anything
handed to us.

1786
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:37,979
You need to grow up,
honey.

1787
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:41,716
You don't know
anything about me.

1788
01:13:41,718 --> 01:13:43,885
You're not that mysterious.

1789
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:46,187
Dogs are mysterious.

1790
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:50,191
Cats, birds, fish.

1791
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:51,659
Fish are
the most mysterious.

1792
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:55,696
And I've made a mint.
Thank you, Jesus.

1793
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,900
But we're not mysterious.

[ Sighs ]
Look, you know,

1795
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:02,503
she shouldn't have said
all those ugly things.

1796
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:06,774
I agree with you,
but [Chuckles] she's drunk.

1797
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,943
She won't remember it
tomorrow.

1798
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,578
Yeah,
she's always drunk.

1799
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,148
She's an alcoholic, Tammy.
She's sick.

1800
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:17,185
You need to focus on getting
your shit together.

1801
01:14:17,187 --> 01:14:22,490
Why don't you figure out
what it is that you really want

1802
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:23,991
and just go after it?

1803
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,861
Maybe you can help her out.

1804
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:33,167
I'm gonna go blow up
some fireworks.

to that place by the river ¶

[ Chuckles ] Oh, sorry.

at me, like, out of the dark?

It looked like you were havin'
a hard time out there.

Mm. She kind of told me
I was an asshole

That's a little harsh.

I'm not so sure
that she wasn't right.

1815
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:15,076
I can't exactly keep
complaining about my life

and not doing
anything about it.

to the bar with Earl.

I shouldn't have brought
Earl here.

I knew it, but I...
I wanted to see you.

you're not a catch.

an unmess, you know?
