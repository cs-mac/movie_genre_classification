1
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,298
Since the beginning of
and humanity throughout the history of the world

2
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,298
there are rituals of manhood well defined.

3
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,463
Such rituals were decisive

4
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:41,095
in determining the exact moment when
boy became a man.

5
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,144
THINK LIKE A MAN

6
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,177
For example, when
when a boy joins the men

7
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,440
in your first battle.

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,542
Knew what they were doing circumcisions public in front of the village?

9
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,954
Thank God mine was not public.

10
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,290
And the most significant moment of all,
marriage.

11
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,686
Yes, that's what I said.

12
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,091
In fact, marriage was the main goal of
boys and men.

13
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,423
Because in the old days

14
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:09,591
Was the only way to get a guy
what I really wanted a girl.

15
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,773
And these days? Wow!
Things have changed, folks.

16
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,874
We no longer have to fight both
get what we want.

17
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,103
We have the internet, my God.
I can be anything you want on the Internet.

18
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,146
Today, men have the advantage of home court
,

19
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,579
which left you with various types of men.

20
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,310
I mean, I do not know where to start.
Has the player.

21
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,422
PLAYER

22
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,647
Hello, Zekey.

23
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:33,759
Texted me sexy?

24
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,793
Not mine, idiot.

25
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:37,930
Are you sure you...

26
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,760
Wait, not done.
Has a mama's boy.

27
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:40,833
FlLHlNHO OF MOTHER

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,467
Happy Valentine's Day, baby.

29
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,634
To you too, Mom.

30
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,197
Thank you, dear.

31
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,399
You know, I think I'll leave you alone.

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,770
Wait, dear, where are you going?

33
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,378
All right, Michael.
I do not want to intrude.

34
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,276
Can I call you later?
-I think not.

35
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,374
Coitadinha.

36
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,215
She is blonde.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,445
Is the dreamer. The dreamer is funny.

38
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,522
The Dreamer

39
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:04,987
I quit my job.

40
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,590
Yes

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,054
wanna be a chef.

42
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,827
I wanted to be a paramedic,
public relations agent, and now

43
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,256
want to be a chef?

44
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,127
Honey, is my dream.

45
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:20,170
Seriously, Dominic?
Because I wanted to be a dancer and Janet Jackson.

46
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,171
When I was seven.
You know what I want to be now?

47
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,265
No.

48
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,808
Your ex.

49
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,446
Last but not least,
is without compromise. Pass the ball!

50
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,517
The SEM COMPROMlSSO

51
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,673
This is mine.

52
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:33,819
Okay, honey.

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,285
-Okay! That beat the drums.
-Okay, big guy.

54
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,692
My God. Accepted, accepted, accepted, yes!

55
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,818
Accept what?

56
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,603
Earrings.

57
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,295
I Agree to these beautiful earrings.

58
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,463
You're the man.

59
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,564
I told him.

60
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,665
-Hey!
-You want a beer?

61
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,372
I'm not saying there is no
guys out there.

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,708
For example, the happily married.

63
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,781
The MARRIED AND FELlZ

64
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,712
Which brings us to my favorite, the
divorced and even happier

65
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:06,785
The DlVORClADO AND MALS FELlZ AlNDA

66
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,875
See that smile.

67
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,922
What I'm saying is that
the balance of power changed.

68
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,786
Zeke, there are more problems with Gail,

69
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,450
is the complaint, is shouting,
humor is crazy.

70
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,188
It will not talk to me
that way. I am an adult, man.

71
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,560
-Adult, man.
-You know me, Don, I grew up.

72
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,034
It is not the only problems he had with Gail
, right?

73
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,970
Hey, Zeke, do not start.
-I'm asking a question!

74
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,698
Ask anything you like.
Begin! Come on, jerk it out!

75
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,900
According to the rumors,
Gail was beating down on you.

76
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,000
According to what?

77
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,774
'' 'I think that was beating down on you.''
No,'' was'' rumors.

78
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,112
There were only rumors, Zeke.

79
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,415
Ced, you got
next day with a spot below the eye.

80
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,422
Falling from the ladder, Mike! Okay?
I have stairs with a slope.

81
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,148
Already descended the stairs with a slope of shoes?

82
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,725
Wait,
it hit you and then you fell down the stairs?

83
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,055
See, now makes sense.
It's very funny.

84
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,428
White solving relationship problems

85
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,262
-a brother.
Not-so.

86
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,665
Way to go.
I'll tell you, J.

87
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,997
Blacks protested, died
for the right to treat each other badly.

88
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,230
My-God.
-You did not protest,

89
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,932
has no such right.
Neither you Bennett.

90
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,567
I saw on TV.
These protests are shown in February.

91
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,645
Stop.

92
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,611
His wife beat you.
It's nothing more.

93
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,842
-There are worse things.
-My ex-wife, right?

94
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,544
All
have to get used to saying it. Ex-wife.

95
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,846
You know, kill me,
you laughing at my pain.

96
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,785
I can not wait for you to live
this drug experience.

97
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,790
I say  Rush Street,
first round due to Bennett.

98
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,286
Should dinner with Kristen today.

99
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,127
She will understand, it is legal.
I will send a message to her.

100
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,927
Welcome back, folks.

101
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:36,598
We're still here with the author of bestsellers
Steve Harvey.

102
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:41,075
What I try to make women understand
is that times have changed,

103
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,908
but the playbook is not.

104
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,983
I received thousands of letters from all types of women

105
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:50,283
can not find, keep or
get what you want from your man.

106
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,084
Until you understand how a man loves,

107
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,659
operates like a man, as he thinks,

108
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,888
and until we get into the mindset of a man,

109
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,794
will never win us the game of love
.

110
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,765
Well, we certainly want to win
in the game of love, Steve.

111
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,836
Dear  - mind if I hang out with the guys?
I take a pizza...

112
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,236
-Question from the audience.
-Hi, Steve.

113
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,434
I live with my boyfriend for five years

114
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,569
and he says he loves me
and is totally committed.

115
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,408
I think I want to know why he had not asked the question?

116
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,949
He
not asked the question because you did not require it.

117
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,912
Will return soon.

118
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,159
-Can you give me two beers?
-Hey!

119
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,593
I am Cedric. Cedric, Cedric.

120
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,522
I'm not married.
This is why not use alliance.

121
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,264
Excuse me, I am a Christian.

122
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,802
Yes, no, no, no, I understand.
I also love Jesus.

123
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:44,336
I spoke with him today:
'' Jesus, I need a girl!''

124
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,035
And I come here and see you,
then say:'' Thanks.''

125
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,009
You are seeing Ced
azarando that cat?

126
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,111
Much the same cat.

127
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,379
See, if you think so,
loses the game before you start.

128
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,646
What are you talking about?

129
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,013
I'm leaving.

130
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,695
It is crazy. I do not like her knees.

131
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,053
Excuse me, miss, I noticed that...

132
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,597
Honestly,
could not care less with what he has to say.

133
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,724
I appreciate that.

134
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,735
I only know that I saw here before
and is always so impressive...

135
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,531
And you'll always have those memories.

136
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,209
Actually, why do not you walk away and pretend that this
...

137
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,877
What I did to get defensive?

138
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,241
Whatever it is,
is not reason to be less beautiful, that's it.

139
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,910
Less beautiful?

140
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,141
I did not mean to disrespect you...

141
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,579
I'll tell you one thing, asshole.

142
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,653
Something happened to you.

143
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,823
Typically, there is an aura,
there is a glow about you that I'm not seeing.

144
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:35,892
I do not know if a relationship is
or if the work is, it's just...

145
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,184
Is this?

146
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,757
It's about the job?

147
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,866
Well, to be frank,

148
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,396
I was fired two months ago.

149
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,474
This drug economy.

150
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,235
-How was it?
-Not good, man.

151
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,641
I literally have nothing to say.
Do not know what is happening.

152
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,713
And my breath is sinister.

153
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,872
-Have a beer.
-You feel?

154
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,679
Can not let it steal your smile
because he,

155
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,754
will ensure your next job
success.

156
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,013
See? Now he is smiling.

157
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,916
Now I'm smiling.

158
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,219
I will go now as a fairy godmother,
because I'm happy.

159
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,122
-Fairy Godmother?
-Yes.

160
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,029
-Have a good night.
-Thank you.

161
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,256
Has been slaughtered.

162
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,324
Wait.

163
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,300
It is
calling back to the insult.

164
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,700
Take.

165
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,171
It probably insulted. Twice.

166
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:31,415
Crazy, huh? Dude. He talked about Jesus, and said
who speaks no English and such, right?

167
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,347
I was lucky.
It really gave me the phone.

168
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,888
The Dark Knight strikes again.

169
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,147
Kristen is amazing.

170
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,246
Legal.

171
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,382
It is a phenomenal girl.

172
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,983
I just do not understand why she's with this guy.

173
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,823
How is your credit?

174
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,163
Movers. Below 400, 430?

175
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:50,324
Caramba! 430?
Can not even have a grocery store card!

176
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,935
Whites  start with 500 points?

177
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,504
Five hundred and fifty, 475 if mulatto.

178
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,896
Cedric!

179
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,235
Yes, Gail.

180
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,075
Gail, hear what I'm trying to say!
I do not care!

181
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,214
I do not care to take the garage!
Gail, you can get everything out of the garage.

182
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,442
I'll tell you one thing.
I want, and that's what... Hello?

183
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,641
Gail?

184
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,878
Yes, I swear...

185
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,785
Do not let him finish his sentence.
Do not like it.

186
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,949
Hey Ced.
When it comes to divorce?

187
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,526
If I had to guess,
say four weeks, 367 hours,

188
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,128
22 minutes, 32 seconds.

189
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,220
It's just a guess.

190
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,958
: Who's counting?
You know what we do?

191
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,194
Let's go out to celebrate with Cedric.

192
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,735
I can not on Sunday.
I have dinner with my mother. She will do...

193
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,862
Every Sunday is like that.

194
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,307
I can not on Sunday.
Jonah has a violin recital.

195
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,775
My God, man, your child does
recitals too.

196
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,380
Wait a minute.
His son plays the violin?

197
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,243
E-cello.
Hey, he's gay.

198
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,444
-Play the violin does not make him gay.
It's true.

199
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,781
Name-a gay violinist. His son-
.

200
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,322
Listen. Cedric is about to
be released from the shackles of Gail-lnfernal.

201
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,791
Forever. And we're about to lose
? On the other recital of Jonah.

202
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,930
-By the way, it sucks.
-Seriously?

203
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,758
I expected it of them, not you.

204
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,332
How-so,'' them''?
-Theirs who, black or what?

205
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,662
Absolutely.

206
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,737
I'm not mad because he has the courage to speak.

207
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,634
Seriously, the boy has no musical ear.

208
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,173
This is your big solo.
Will roll the Gap Band.

209
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,437
Know, Dropped a Bomb on Me,
he is the last... '' Baby''!

210
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,172
See, I have a great idea.
My mom cooks for us.

211
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,252
It'll make some cookies, a delicious dish
. Let's celebrate.

212
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,286
Mike, I almost punched
at you now, man.

213
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,377
I almost took a header.

214
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,286
I'm not in his mother's house to celebrate my divorce
!

215
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,724
-We have to eat. We'll start there...
-I do not want to eat there!

216
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,089
I'm not in his mother's house.

217
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,494
She has a new film by Tyler Perry,
For Colored Girls on Blu-ray.

218
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,293
We will have a nice night,
a night to unwind.

219
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,470
I'll count ,
Janet Jackson caught the end AlDS

220
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,039
and crazy plays
their children out the window. Okay?

221
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,767
Can we celebrate now? Come on!
-I hate you.

222
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,875
-Okay, raise!
Yes, sir.

223
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,205
Okay, I'm inside.

224
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,713
Life is great, guys.
May it never change.

225
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,211
We could not know that the first bomb had fallen.

226
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,718
The war was declared.

227
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,289
And our secrets
had fallen into enemy hands.

228
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,859
BEHAVE YOURSELF AS A Lady THINK LIKE A MAN

229
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,519
We were betrayed by one of our.
A man.

230
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,290
I'm talking about a man with a penis.

231
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,024
Someone who should know how.

232
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,962
And because of these actions,
a war that was now under way,

233
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,535
affect all my little band of brothers.

234
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,831
We have another question
at the hearing, Steve.

235
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,338
Steve, I get
guys who do not want relationship.

236
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,737
Why not?

237
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,933
Did you hear that?

238
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:18,015
Men respect women of character.
Arrange some.

239
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,846
Exactly.

240
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,321
Steve, I am a member of an office
law firms, have their own house,

241
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,353
but I'm single for three years.

242
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,152
Why not find a guy
according to my standards?

243
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,261
You may need to adjust them a little.

244
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,260
-Bullshit.
Should we lower the standards?

245
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,956
You have an income of six figures. He must also have
?

246
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,034
Yes

247
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,466
Do you have home ownership. He must also have
?

248
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,595
Yes and yes.

249
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,336
We have another question from the audience.

250
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,238
Hi, Steve.
I am currently dating and I just want to know

251
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,380
when the time is right to present
my boyfriend to my child?

252
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:54,110
I know that single women do not want
a parade of men entering the house.

253
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,378
-Exactly!
-I understand that.

254
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,522
-But if the guy is serious...
-What, Mom?

255
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,849
How is it?

256
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,787
-... Bring it soon.
Good morning, mother.

257
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,622
Why invest in a man six months
and then present it to children

258
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,231
and he do not like their children or vice versa
,

259
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,028
then guess what?
You wasted six months.

260
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,065
That's true. I did it.

261
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,270
Alex?

262
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,607
Alex?

263
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:27,975
Alex!

264
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,448
Wake up!

265
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,622
See, honey, brought two coffees with milk
double.

266
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,921
Thank you, dear. Take-
.

267
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,924
We need a little caffeine
after last night.

268
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,094
It was wonderful.

269
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,328
I will refresh.

270
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,976
So I'll be back soon.

271
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,842
'll Be here.

272
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,706
Do not move.

273
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,939
Do not worry. I will not.

274
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,813
So
was thinking we could have our first real date.

275
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,685
-Can we go see a movie?
Yes, dear.

276
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,487
We should do this.
Things between us will start getting serious.

277
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,423
I was thinking of seeing the new film by Tyler Perry.

278
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,794
You know, one where the guy is bad
with girlfriend

279
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:21,166
and a guy comes and rescues
and in the end, both found Jesus.

280
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,673
Alex? So
agrees to see the movie Tyler Perry?

281
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,946
Alex!

282
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,615
Michelle was Fun

283
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,947
Michelle'' ''?

284
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,353
You Mya, idiot!

285
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,250
Mya.

286
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,298
He took my coffee black?

287
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,360
It was as if a hidden truth had been revealed

288
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,566
hardcover and paperback.

289
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,496
For my book club.

290
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,196
-To me! To my mother-
!

291
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,966
For the first time in their lives, women stopped

292
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,907
to get advice on relationships to other women.

293
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,102
Really?

294
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,372
I have others.

295
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,549
Thank you.

296
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,778
Instead went straight to a man,
Steve Harvey.

297
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,679
He became famous as a comedian, but this drug
? It was not funny.

298
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,988
And because of this,
things would never be the same.

299
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,097
'' Mama's boy'' and''
'' The Single Mother

300
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,738
Excuse?

301
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,972
Excuse?

302
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,617
Do you happen studied at Fairfaix?

303
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,079
Yes

304
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,723
Me too. Michael Hanover.

305
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,722
-Candace Hall.
Yes, I remember.

306
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,360
I had classes with her sister Lisa.

307
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,729
Near-line.
-Sorry, do not recognize.

308
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,594
Yes, I had 1.5 I
44 pounds when we graduated.

309
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,928
He wore glasses and was toothy.

310
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,629
Just look familiar, maybe here?

311
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,138
Yes, it seems.

312
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,208
Do not know if it's a good thing or bad
. You are already shipping me?

313
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,372
Well, you grew up. Very well.

314
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,880
And you have not changed anything.
You are beautiful.

315
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,715
Well, you need to put the glasses back
, obviously.

316
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,149
No, actually, I'm nearsighted.

317
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,219
Also, how could I forget
my teenage crush?

318
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,260
I used to look at you walking down the aisle

319
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,122
and was awestruck by his smile.

320
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,133
I'm rambling,
I do it when I get nervous.

321
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:32,793
Next in line.

322
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,497
Well, it was nice to meet you,
I say, see you.

323
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,636
It was good to have been noticed.

324
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,243
Next in line please.

325
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,614
Candace?

326
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,648
We could have coffee or something?

327
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,415
Recovering the past we did not have.

328
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,655
I can not, actually.
I have to get my...

329
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,090
-Husband? There...
-

330
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,992
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, I have a son.

331
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,663
What about going out to dinner?

332
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,635
Yes

333
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,208
'' The No Compromise'' and''
The Girl who wants to marry''

334
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,875
-I finally understood.
-Understood what?

335
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,813
Jeremy
ask me to marry is like asking to paint the kitchen

336
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,284
or lower the toilet seat.

337
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,823
It will not happen until I require.

338
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,655
And I never demanded damn it.

339
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,797
You know that still divide
all accounts?

340
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,466
-I thought it was his idea.
Yes, in college.

341
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,636
He ??worked and studied and I felt sorry for him.

342
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,861
But I'm still paying for it until today.

343
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,403
Hey, I'm Kristen.

344
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,700
-Hello, welcome.
-Welcome, please sign.

345
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,345
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. Six months.

346
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,979
Yes, we can not wait.

347
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,837
Thank you.

348
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,175
Here we come.

349
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,876
-Watch your step.
-Here is a man with a plan.

350
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,216
He knows what he wants,
he knows what he has.

351
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:03,494
I sell beautiful homes to live
and we live in a dormitory for boys.

352
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,891
On Valentine's Day  last
boys were there.

353
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,190
You're saying...

354
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,062
My God, I'm one of the boys,
except that I have a vagina!

355
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,636
I swear it was easier for Frodo Baggins
.

356
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,330
I'm sorry, who?
-Frodo, a Hobbit.

357
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,736
I do not understand the hobbits.

358
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,472
Okay, no, not me. That's so stupid.
Jeremy had a game of chess.

359
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,806
It's totally stupid.

360
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,073
So what you gonna do?

361
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,741
Vai trick him into getting engaged?

362
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:30,047
I will not deceive you.
I require of him.

363
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,847
They have been together for nine years.

364
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,820
So what makes you think
that will change now?

365
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,357
I have some new information.

366
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,687
It?

367
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:40,228
Yes, as Steve says,''
Do not hate the player...''

368
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,363
Change the game.

369
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,569
Your turn . Wait!

370
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,726
Lift your left leg.

371
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,739
C-A'''' ca.

372
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,004
Really? '''' I am a ca?

373
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,704
with the same woman for nine years.

374
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,678
I am Stedman Graham relationships.

375
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,613
I'm not talking about a'' cad'' ca.

376
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,049
I'm talking about, his face dominated by women
,

377
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,780
has no courage, because the woman
the breadwinner.

378
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,192
-Way, as is Kristen?
-You are great.

379
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,386
We stayed until two o'clock
playing Call of Duty. She loved it.

380
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,462
It does this... She does it for you.

381
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,793
I know my wife. Fantasy?
Science fiction? Action?

382
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,493
All-Love, she also loves.
No, she does this drug

383
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,232
for you In the end, she thinks...

384
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,101
That's just stupid.

385
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,468
What the hell?

386
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,613
Jeremy course not proposed to her,
not out of puberty.

387
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,484
It's time to clean.

388
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,485
You first.

389
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,515
No, no. This is your problem, Gail.

390
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,489
You do not want to hear,
just want to talk.

391
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,159
What I said?
Who will be there tomorrow.

392
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,596
No, no. Listen, Gail...

393
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,059
-I will not argue with you.
-Face.

394
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,666
I'm trying to talk and you will not let me... Hello?

395
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,026
Gail?

396
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,303
Did it again.
Hung up on me.

397
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,295
What do you call the wedding rings?

398
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,495
I do not know.

399
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,302
The engagement ring, wedding ring, ring
and suffering.

400
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,239
In your case, who picks up the ring.

401
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,108
It is not time for that.
You underestimate me because I'm short.

402
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,304
No, it's because you're a fool.

403
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,177
What's up? What's happening, baby?

404
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,818
What the hell is wrong with you?

405
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,681
-You're stoned.
Yes, is on drugs!

406
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,623
You're stoned or whatever
on my eHarmony profile is true.

407
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,191
I'm in heaven, gentlemen.

408
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,918
I met a girl.

409
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,657
No, in fact, she is a girl.
I met a woman.

410
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,331
You are acting like a woman in love.

411
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:28,367
'' The Dreamer'' and''
The Woman Who Is His Own Man''

412
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,766
Request it!

413
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,803
Hey, guess who's back. Table eight.

414
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,146
It is a lot of sand for your own truck, Sun

415
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,147
That does not exist, man.

416
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,810
She probably spends more here in
night than you earn in a month.

417
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:48,354
Okay, but think about how much it will save
if I cook for her.

418
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,654
Ah, you're crazy.

419
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,422
Dominic. Chives?

420
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,122
Okay, chef leaving.

421
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,323
-Well, it's beautiful. What is happening?
-I?

422
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,399
'Yes.
-Thanks, that was nice of you.

423
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,731
Duke joined a team,
bought a new laptop, I met a guy.

424
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,032
I think I'll try the white bass.

425
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,937
Hey, know what?

426
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,032
A guy.

427
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,506
Really?
Not an inflatable doll?

428
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,045
Do not be so surprised. Not that...

429
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,343
Honey, I'm just saying, you
divorced two years ago.

430
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,020
And three, maybe four years
last time we had sex.

431
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,349
He said he knew a guy, Lauren, not
I changed my last name.

432
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,480
Yet.

433
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,851
I want all the details, darling.
Tell me everything.

434
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,257
-It is attractive?
-Pure fire.

435
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,420
She has big breasts?

436
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,498
Yes, as are her breasts?
Tell us all.

437
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,828
Breasts? Surely something white.

438
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,005
White thing. We love breasts.

439
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,037
You is not white, Bennett. You of course.

440
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,471
-He has lovely eyes. Emotional.
-Yes!

441
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,601
He is sensitive.

442
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,176
I know she has an ass.

443
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,848
It has one rear
JLo or Serena Williams.

444
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,643
Ass so big, can you hide
underneath it if it rains.

445
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,376
-Butt is too much.
-There is no such thing.

446
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,077
Whew, there. The bigger the better.

447
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,919
But it was not just physical attraction,
was intellectual.

448
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,524
He ??loved The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.

449
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,391
Bought  a book club for the mother.
Not that cute?

450
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,827
Yes, and a little gay.

451
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:02,934
He is a gentleman.

452
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,330
-It is a'' ca.'' I know it is.
-Surely a dog.

453
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,734
You two, you see what they are talking.
It is not like that.

454
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,930
She is a lady.

455
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,167
-'ve Been hooked.
-Enjoy it while it lasts, Mike.

456
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,242
Let me tell you,
will not last forever.

457
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,674
All they get happy.

458
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,371
See, but here's what is real.

459
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,551
When you wake in the morning, and go in the room
,

460
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,881
and you see it pissing
with their Jordans.

461
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,384
Jordans And not normal.

462
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,353
I'm talking about the patent leather,

463
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,549
the most expensive.

464
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,751
Do not listen to them, Mike.
Relationships are beautiful.

465
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,596
My opinion-.
-So when they go out?

466
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,857
Saturday night. She has to find a babysitter
first, and then...

467
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,058
A dog sitter?

468
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,429
No, she has a son.

469
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,069
What?
-She has a son.

470
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,738
Careful when dating the mother of a baby.

471
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,430
-Why?
-Why is the mother of a baby.

472
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,940
Dude, she's not looking
a few good laughs and sex.

473
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,771
She has had many good laughs and sex.

474
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,311
-Sermon.
-She wants a husband.

475
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,812
A father to his son.
Speaking of which, where's the father?

476
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,746
-Good question, Zeke.
-Thank you.

477
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:54,852
It may be a psychopath.

478
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,921
Had parole for killing her boyfriend before.

479
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,386
Or it can be a
of hiding in a bush

480
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,821
Expecting a stranger in the house that goes from the baby's mother.

481
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,257
And when he gets there, he jumps from the bushes

482
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,294
reaches
this guy in the head with a brick.

483
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,626
Without even realizing that the relationship with her mother
baby was platonic.

484
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,097
They never caught this guy?

485
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,999
There is a case filed.
The police will not reopen the case.

486
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,332
They said they found the brick.

487
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,907
I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

488
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,409
-None of that matters.
-Seriously?

489
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,845
You should see her smile.

490
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,574
'Oh, damn. Right. Alright.
-Good night, Mike.

491
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,117
I speak of bricks!
You want to talk about a smile.

492
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,915
-There is one thing, however.
-I knew he was born a woman.

493
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,148
No.

494
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,023
-He  is, you know, it's...
-He is what?

495
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,252
A little younger.

496
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,986
You kidnapped a baby, is not it?

497
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,597
No, he seems very mature indeed.

498
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,335
Wait, why am I so excited?

499
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,596
We have not even left.

500
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,170
I still need to qualify if it is even a candidate.

501
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,607
Qualify?

502
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,107
What are the long-term goals?

503
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,006
And the short term?
It's a good provider?

504
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,769
Do not ask all at once.

505
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,006
I know, do not worry.
I plan to be reserved.

506
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,979
You? How?

507
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,720
Act like a lady,
but think like a man.

508
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,982
Ah, you fell in that sexist crap?

509
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,319
It gives us a vision
the male perspective.

510
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,895
Why
lower my standards to have a boyfriend? Who does that?

511
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,531
I'm sorry. Now, what man?

512
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,893
Someone like me.

513
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,695
Or at least, an attractive man, worship.

514
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:23,204
With 1.80 m, six-figure salary and
is not intimidated by my success.

515
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,603
Stop chasing the ghost of James Merrill.

516
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,679
He is married and gone.

517
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,903
This guy was great.

518
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,344
Here we go.
Let's do a little research.

519
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,484
This-is you.
-Please, I do not...

520
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,051
'' Strong Women,
independent and solitary.''

521
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,814
I do not need a bald man in a book

522
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,551
telling me I'm strong and independent.

523
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,659
Honey, this is fact.

524
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:42,917
Lonely but forgotten.

525
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,390
You are a bitch.

526
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,688
You are very strong, Lauren.

527
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,158
No such thing as too strong.
And you know what?

528
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,600
If I were a man, the youngest director of operations
a Fortune 500 company

529
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,433
would actually be a good thing.
Choveria women.

530
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,336
Yes, but the men fled when they discover
.

531
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,101
It's not just your work, Lauren.

532
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,473
Do you remember what Marcel said in his last meeting
,

533
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,605
when he chose another wine?

534
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,942
-I made a better choice.
-What were your words?

535
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,211
'' You do not need a man, Lauren,
you are a man.''

536
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,187
Happy belated birthday. For you.

537
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,091
Do you know all this waiting for something better?
Is making it bitter.

538
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,732
Hey, honey?

539
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:26,927
I stopped for a beer, but
brought dinner.

540
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,340
My God.

541
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,271
Oh, my God! My anime posters!
We were robbed!

542
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,040
Kris! Are you home?

543
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,943
Yes Where's the fire? What?

544
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,617
You do not realize they were robbed?

545
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,877
I took a tidy things. Relax.

546
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,884
-He repaired?
-Yes.

547
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,286
Justice League? Darth Vader? SpongeBob?
Where are they? Are they okay?

548
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,153
They are safe. They are well.

549
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,163
I just thought we could paint the room.

550
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,822
Paint.

551
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,435
-Right.
-E redecorate.

552
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,905
-Redecorate?
-Yes.

553
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,405
I thought I loved those things.
Why did you do that?

554
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,304
Well, looks like a dorm, Jeremy.

555
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,308
-Stop it.
-We are adults, Santo Cristo.

556
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,174
We have a decent life.

557
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,443
It's time to invest here and make a real home.

558
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,814
With  plates and matching cups

559
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,588
and a new sofa.

560
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,451
What's wrong with my sofa?

561
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,761
You got him in a dumpster.

562
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,953
Yes

563
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,693
I'm sure
Annalisa was conceived there.

564
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,927
There are cigarette burns, stains based on
, 2006 and scabies.

565
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,605
-You're being dramatic.
-I'm not.

566
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,765
His aunt who pees when she laughs?
She peed all over the couch last Christmas.

567
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,968
It's disgusting. We are like animals.

568
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,875
I cleaned the cigarette burns
based and shed.

569
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,347
This sofa has history.

570
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,518
And now it was.

571
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,414
So here are some new ideas.

572
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,757
We could take a look.
Find some new styles.

573
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,519
We have to decide the color.

574
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,627
I know you like mauve. Do you know?

575
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,632
There was a time  you enjoyed salmon.

576
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,430
I'd rather watch Letters to Juliet
with you again.

577
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,064
I know that you prefer.
For cried at the end when they meet again.

578
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,904
I was not crying, right?

579
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,604
I was having an allergic reaction to perfume
film.

580
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,702
You bought the soundtrack.

581
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,773
It's a good soundtrack.

582
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,543
Look, I'm very bad at it. Okay?

583
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,983
Please can redecorate your own?

584
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,482
-Without me?
-Seriously?

585
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,181
Seriously.

586
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,516
Alone?

587
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,493
Yes

588
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,756
-I trust you.
Great.

589
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,123
Let me ask you a question.

590
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,233
Where is the last guy you slept with whom
in less than 90 days?

591
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,392
I mean, John?

592
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,603
Hey! Gata!

593
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,929
What's up, girl?

594
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,571
Hey, I had fun the other night.

595
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,729
That's right, Alex?

596
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,170
Yes, Melanie. I was going to call...

597
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,742
Melanie? Mya is, black.

598
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,776
Yes I have to go. I'll call you.

599
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,744
Do not believe you called Melanie.

600
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,077
Okay. That 'will not affect me.

601
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,413
I have control over my life
and I'm better.

602
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,418
'' The Player'' and'' The Girl's Rule 90 Days''

603
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,491
I do not know, Sonia.
I feel like an X-ray vision.

604
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,150
How glasses men.

605
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,787
We lost a lot of time complaining because men do not want to compromise,

606
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,123
just want to stay.

607
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,027
But in fact, always had the power.

608
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,332
True. We?

609
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,198
Yes! We control the wafer.

610
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,101
Who controls the wafer controls the game.

611
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,141
Okay, got it. What is a cookie?

612
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,079
It's a metaphor.
-What?

613
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,674
Da ..

614
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,451
'Yes. The wafer! The wafer-
!

615
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,712
Understood. The wafer!

616
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,619
I assure you, the power is on the wafer.

617
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,985
Then, we control the wafer?

618
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,717
Putting it in the pot

619
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,294
and closing the lid.

620
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,455
Right.

621
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,363
Until some kid grow up and really deserves.

622
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,492
Understood.

623
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,663
It's like the rule of the five meetings of my cousin.

624
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,932
No, that is for amateurs.

625
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,074
I'm talking about something a little more radical.

626
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,168
You need to buy the book,
has a whole chapter about it.

627
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,146
'' How to Get the Respect You Deserve:
The Rule of 90 Days.''

628
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,272
Are you stoned?

629
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,248
-No.
-Who waits 90 days?

630
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,716
If it works in the largest companies in the country,

631
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,083
Will work with me.

632
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,986
When I worked at Ford,
had a trial period of 90 days.

633
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,822
I had to work 90 days
before receiving benefits.

634
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,090
Ford thinks so.:
'' Let's see how it behaves.

635
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,169
'' If it does not delay and to demonstrate its value
, receive benefits. ''

636
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:25,275
So, if Ford Motor Company expects to release 90 days
benefits,

637
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,008
why women can not wait?

638
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,201
This is our problem.

639
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,780
Always just releasing to any stallion that wears Axe

640
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:32,975
and think my name is Melanie.

641
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,812
But no matter, we also have
needs.

642
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,855
Listen to what you're saying.
Do you really think I could wait 90 days?

643
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:44,017
Yes  I spent six months
dreaming with a guy I once saw a wedding.

644
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,856
The one who slept on the beach?

645
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,089
Yes, and you never called me.

646
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,292
So, certainly,
wait 90 days.

647
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,527
Actually, it could wait another 90.

648
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,797
I'm sick of men.
Maybe I should start dating women.

649
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,271
My God, paid $ 50
if you kiss.

650
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,503
-It has to be with his tongue.
-Man, get outta here!

651
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,634
Experienced.

652
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:05,910
The
What's wrong with men of this generation?

653
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,585
I wonder the same thing every day.

654
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:13,417
What happened to respecting women?
What happened to decency?

655
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,222
Give me the honor to pay them a drink
?

656
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,521
Absolutely. Thank you for offering.

657
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,788
-We would like to...
-Why?

658
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,929
Because  want an intelligent conversation?

659
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,898
Or because you want to discuss the Policy for the war in Chechnya?

660
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,264
I do not talk about politics on a first date
.

661
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,432
-We do not. So I...
No, I know.

662
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,874
It's a visual thing, right?

663
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,741
You saw me, I sexualizou
and now wants to take my clothes off?

664
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:36,836
Definitely not.

665
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,381
So why?
Because, you know, you do not know me.

666
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,109
I may be a psychopath.

667
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,380
Can I be a serial killer.
I have 16 personalities.

668
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,986
Whiskey with Coca-Cola.
-It's for now.

669
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,820
16 And drinks her?

670
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,255
My name is Zeke.

671
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,293
Mya.

672
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,064
Nice to meet you, Mya.

673
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,436
First day. Missing 89.

674
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,606
Request table 16!

675
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,077
Dominic .
The valets are not realizing. Go help.

676
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,850
Thank you.
-Thank you.

677
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,945
Hey, that's my car!

678
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,150
Who said the standard should be high?

679
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,054
Where do I open the window?

680
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,868
Glass. Glass.

681
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,200
It is not the final destination.

682
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,598
Door open.

683
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:13,869
Drugs.

684
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,313
If I was less smart,
'd think you were following me.

685
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,046
No, I just...

686
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,982
I was just strolling.

687
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,886
Enjoy the ride.

688
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,655
Well, wait.

689
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,895
Change your mind?

690
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,927
I could take you to dinner one day?

691
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:35,892
What about tomorrow night?

692
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,396
We love the fact that you are a woman
strong and confident with a good job,

693
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,039
but we are men.

694
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,699
Our DNA is coded to be the provider.

695
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:50,347
And if you never leave us thinking we're in control
,

696
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,847
do not declare our love for you.

697
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,043
And yes, a woman
try to make us feel like a man.

698
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,243
It is a bitch.

699
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:01,188
We are like dogs. If we cuddle,
be faithful to you forever.

700
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,622
, dogs. That's right, Steve.

701
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,795
Do not need this book.

702
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,235
QUESTION NUMBER 1: Equals
ARE YOUR OBJETlVOS SHORT TERM?

703
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,432
Ah, yes!

704
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,477
Oh, dear. Jennifer
will take care of you tonight.

705
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,704
You're going to bingo with Grandma?

706
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,349
-No. I actually have a meeting.
-Seriously?

707
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,017
With a man or a woman?

708
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,881
With a man!
Why are you asking me this?

709
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:35,048
Because
heard Grandma say that is beginning to suspect.

710
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,251
You know, I do not care.

711
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,827
Sorry for the delay.

712
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,498
Hey, Bennett, enter the game. Come on.
-And here, man?

713
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,223
Yesterday was the best night of my life.

714
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,526
-Really?
-LncrIvel.

715
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,828
-Look at the ball.
-It was fired yesterday?

716
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,096
Okay.
I will earn double the buffet.

717
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,567
-Right, throw the ball.
-I hope she's worth.

718
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,471
What will you do with it?
What will you do with it?

719
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,804
Tell!

720
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,745
Passed behind!

721
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,073
I'll take you to The Lounge.

722
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,045
Maurice got me a private room

723
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,377
and I only have to pay
wine and tip.

724
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,953
Great. Will take her 2005 Honda Civic that

725
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,614
without the bumper or car at
U.S. $ 155 000 which she thinks is her?

726
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,589
I think I'll be honest.

727
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,722
What truth? You
is an unemployed waiter?

728
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,992
Zeke, aspiring chef unemployed.
We have already discussed this.

729
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,725
-That is not the issue.
-It would be stupid.

730
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,963
If you want to take her to bed,
will have to lie.

731
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,970
I told Gail that he had won the lottery.

732
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,373
And I had to supply to get the prize. She gave me $ 20.

733
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,839
Do not lie to her.

734
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,035
Do not want to lie to her.

735
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,182
Okay, wait.
You do not need to lie. Omit.

736
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,782
That's right, omit.

737
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,954
Say it's a chef
crowded with several job offers.

738
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,112
Your car is in the shop.

739
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,419
You're not expensive your car is in the shop because
.

740
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,491
Actually, my cousin,
he rents luxury cars. I'll get one.

741
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,527
All you have to do it drunk is

742
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,063
and drowning the goose,
then you tell the truth.

743
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,635
Gail thought I was an executive, and
met at the gate.

744
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,725
I was collecting cards.

745
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,327
But soon after you became executive.

746
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,565
It had nothing to do with it.

747
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,197
: Who got the interview?
-Thomas.

748
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,209
Do not interrupt me, Mike.
That's what Gail does. I hate it.

749
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,279
-Why is it so sensitive?
-Okay. Don, when

750
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,143
a woman falls in love,
stand anything.

751
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,682
-Trust me.
-Just do it right.

752
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,650
Right. That's...

753
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,047
Hey, man.

754
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,052
-I clean the ball. Best throw-
.

755
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,384
No, I have sanitizer in your backpack.

756
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,367
Sorry . Wrong apartment.

757
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,434
It's my lucky chair.

758
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,636
What are you doing?

759
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,379
Dear, what do you think?

760
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,206
We spent all day at the mall and we chose

761
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,750
-something modern with a classic touch.
-'' We''?

762
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,149
It. Gianni, our designer.

763
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,922
Old out, new inside.
Beautiful, no?

764
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,226
Seems I do not think our apartment.

765
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,162
Exactly. It looks like a house of adults. Loved.

766
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,290
Stop!

767
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,132
Unhook the chair.

768
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,302
The chair is lucky.

769
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,171
Ceded.

770
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,088
Hey, wait a minute.
Since when do you speak Italian?

771
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,053
Goodness.

772
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,461
-This is the dress.
-Really?

773
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,133
Your butt looks great in that dress.

774
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,858
No, it's too sexy.

775
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,697
Does not happen.

776
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,204
Sonia  I want it to wait 90 days, not 90
seconds.

777
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,468
'' I look like a potential girlfriend,'' not''
other fish in the sea''.

778
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,612
'' What the hell is other fish in the sea''?

779
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,213
You need to read the book!

780
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,746
Do not want to read the book.

781
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,384
Steve says one guy fishing
for two reasons.

782
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,315
A, he fishes to eat.

783
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,490
Other words, whether a potential girlfriend,
someone to take home

784
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:57,559
and submit to the mother,
someone to build a life.

785
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,889
Or two, he wants another fish in the sea.

786
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,465
Other words, he wants a trophy,
someone to show to friends

787
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,226
and hang on the wall as a prize.

788
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,837
Be careful with this award,
because it will play back at sea.

789
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,064
Right.

790
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:15,903
Right.

791
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,306
How am I?

792
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,380
As a potential girlfriend.
With a nice butt.

793
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,644
-Really?
-Really!

794
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,086
Great. The question is: what about him?

795
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,655
Just missing my list of success.

796
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,322
What is a list of success?

797
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,085
You can take your wine off the list?

798
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,223
You're crazy.

799
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,765
Is where I wrote my strategies for today's meeting.

800
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,561
Sounds like you're going to war.

801
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,601
Yes, because love is a battlefield.

802
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,795
My God.

803
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,273
Steve says we have to establish conditions

804
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,843
before you even get in the car,

805
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,138
'' are not an unlock and enter''.

806
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,270
A what?

807
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,371
He barely unlock the car and have you enter.

808
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,109
He does not need to open the door.

809
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,080
I see nothing wrong in being so
.

810
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,262
You are beautiful.

811
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,562
Thank .

812
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,533
LncrIvel.

813
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,439
What cute!

814
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,715
Where?
My God, that short skirt!

815
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,942
Right. Unethical.

816
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,152
Sorry, sir,
cashing of my tip.

817
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,124
Is open.

818
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,529
Is open.

819
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,631
Do not go out with men that do not open the door for me.

820
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,340
Really?
-Seriously.

821
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,909
-Really?
-Yes.

822
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,170
I, huh!

823
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,685
He did not!

824
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,650
Gotcha!

825
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,591
His carriage waiting.

826
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:13,921
Thank you.

827
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,927
Very funny, huh?

828
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,831
I know.

829
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,873
There are some basic questions that every woman should do to man

830
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,204
to find out if this guy wants
take you seriously

831
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,972
or if you just want to take you to bed.

832
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,543
My short term goals?

833
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,685
Type, tomorrow?

834
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,947
I need a joint.

835
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,422
To answer your question ,

836
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,050
I think my goals in the short and long term are the same.

837
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,456
How so?

838
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:51,000
My whole life I have dedicated myself to work and tried
me highlight

839
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,533
and guess what I'm looking now

840
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,706
is someone to share it.

841
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,030
-So...
-So you...

842
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,540
You first.

843
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,647
What are your short term goals?

844
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:10,411
You know what? I would like to
skip dinner and go straight to dessert.

845
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,177
This was the beginning,

846
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,550
-know?
-Really?

847
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,191
This wine is great.

848
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,385
Thank you. Thank you.

849
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,828
Lauren, tell me more about you.
What do you do?

850
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,055
Work with the administration.

851
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:27,203
For a media company.
I do not want to talk about my work.

852
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,202
Week long.

853
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,236
Talk about yourself.
What do you do?

854
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,742
I am a chef.

855
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,776
Really? Where?

856
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,905
Well, actually,

857
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,345
'm considering two proposals.

858
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,543
You're so good?

859
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,921
Yeah, but do not want to give chance
talking about it, you know?

860
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,594
No, I understand. Stop there.

861
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,057
You know what?
Better not talk about work.

862
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,757
It is better.

863
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,903
And then, what you want in a relationship?

864
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,539
Or what are your long term goals?
One of the two.

865
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,471
Sincerely,
I want to open my own restaurant one day.

866
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,886
Sorry, I'm talking about work.

867
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,919
No, this is a dream.

868
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,988
Can we talk about dreams.
Dreams are good.

869
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:26,320
It's nice to hear a woman say that.

870
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,499
I believe you can accomplish any dream

871
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,132
if you are willing to fight for it.

872
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,070
Could not agree more.

873
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,766
-Health.
-Salud.

874
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,421
Remember when we were in college

875
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,755
and smoked and talked for hours?

876
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:58,719
Yes

877
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:05,165
About our dreams, plans and objectives
.

878
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,264
What about time travel.

879
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,304
What do you expect of the future, Jeremy?

880
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:16,136
I do not think there will be
flying cars, androids, but yes.

881
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,804
Definitely. There has to be androids.

882
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,678
No, I mean their future, Jeremy.

883
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,117
What are your long term goals, Jeremy?

884
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,321
Who are you, Oprah?

885
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,852
You're funny.

886
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:39,026
I have some ideas of design style rock chic

887
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,694
I'm very excited.

888
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,395
It does seem exciting-.
-Is.

889
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,630
It.

890
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,132
E then

891
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:49,006
What are your long term goals?

892
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,144
I'm a guy more impulsive, you know?

893
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,274
Oh, I know.

894
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,210
Legal.

895
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,659
Turn up the volume. Increases.

896
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,256
This is my... It is.

897
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,658
Know-these guys?
-Course.

898
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,660
My band has opened a show for them.

899
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,737
Do you have a band?

900
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:15,928
I had.

901
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,197
Almost signed a record deal.

902
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,441
Let me hear your CD. Please!

903
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,578
Why do you think I have a CD?

904
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,873
Do not know anyone who has had a band of R & B

905
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,176
and not have the CD in the car.

906
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,580
Wow, I feel so unique in this moment.

907
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,618
-So, you'll find him.
-Is.

908
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,257
Let me see.

909
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,051
Wow!

910
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,421
What madness.

911
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,620
At least not permanently used.

912
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,889
What?

913
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,726
Put ??your favorite music.

914
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:46,992
Wow.

915
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,995
Please indicate command.

916
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,937
CD. Play track

917
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,534
seven.

918
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,543
Playing  track seven.

919
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:02,382
Last night I had a dream about a dream

920
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,380
With you

921
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,225
You wrote this?

922
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:16,696
Now every time I think
seems that only think of you

923
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,694
That's beautiful.

924
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:24,968
In an instant I had given up on love

925
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:30,111
I was in another part of us

926
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,336
Who was she?

927
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:32,771
Who?

928
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,749
The girl who broke her heart.

929
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,116
Why
think someone broke my heart?

930
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,678
Range seven.

931
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,354
I left the past in music.

932
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:51,467
Last night I had a dream about a dream...

933
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,932
Oh my God.

934
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,043
Okay, wait. Wait.
-What?

935
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,615
I. .. do not do it on the first date.

936
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,809
Okay, I understand.

937
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,818
I am also a Christian.
I respect that, you know, and...

938
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,827
I enjoyed myself.

939
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,290
Me too.

940
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,693
Well, thank you.

941
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,034
Pronto. I got it.

942
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,206
Got what?

943
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,468
True My short term goal.

944
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,043
You fool.

945
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,400
Listen.

946
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,204
I thought about it all night.
I want to meet my mother.

947
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,338
Really?

948
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,743
It's very important to me.

949
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,276
Well,

950
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,051
want you to meet my son.

951
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,589
I love.
Just tell the time and place...

952
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,095
Hi, I'm the Duke.
You rang my mother?

953
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,424
No, mate.
I behaved nicely.

954
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,033
I know. He likes video games?

955
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,702
Ever played Street Racer Three?

956
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,064
-No.
-So you do not know what is good, buddy!

957
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,007
Have a good evening, Candace.

958
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,200
Good evening. Thank you.

959
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,438
-Nice to meet you, Duke. Do not forget...
-Enjoyment.

960
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,547
I enjoyed myself.

961
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,446
I also enjoyed myself.

962
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,889
Right.

963
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:28,223
Doing this is a'' good night'' official.

964
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,959
You know, I need a drink before
sleep.

965
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,233
-A drink.
-Is.

966
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,930
Course. It has a great bar around the corner.

967
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,270
-Have fun.
-I'll dispense with that?

968
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,979
I can not do anything.

969
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,574
How long will it take to invite me to join?

970
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,140
Five meetings.

971
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,778
To drink a drink.

972
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,083
Good evening.

973
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,495
This woman is crazy.

974
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,248
Good morning, beautiful.

975
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,981
Thank you.

976
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,350
Prepared his breakfast.

977
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,752
Really?

978
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,321
Yes

979
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,930
-With what I had in the kitchen?
-Give it to me.

980
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,300
They are simple to eggs Florentine, with a touch of my
,

981
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,993
ingredients left over from their Thai food.

982
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,537
-Single? Sounds great.
-Tell me what you think.

983
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,671
It's delicious.

984
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,807
Really? I love women who eat.

985
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,680
And I love men who cook.

986
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,285
Maybe I can do for you again someday.

987
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,022
Juice, please?

988
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,856
Medium spicy?

989
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,163
Thank you.

990
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,864
Who is this?

991
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:14,367
My best friend, Candace.

992
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,868
-Right.
-And my godson, Duke.

993
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:22,144
You know, you is not exactly the stereotype of a
godmother.

994
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,509
Thank God.

995
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,550
Entered without knocking again, no?

996
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,395
I did not know would be here.
Should be running away from her house.

997
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,860
Firstly,
I live here, you do not,

998
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:45,501
, and secondly, she has a rule
five meetings before inviting me.

999
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,762
Can you believe it?
I am a black pimp, a negrolo'' original''.

1000
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,736
Five meetings?
It is a Muslim extremist or something?

1001
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:52,900
She is a diva.

1002
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,274
She refuses to go
if I open the door.

1003
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,176
Gail did.
It took me over the edge.

1004
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,180
'' Open the door. How will I spend
if you do not open the door?''

1005
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:04,081
'' My hands hurt.
You better open the goddamn door!''

1006
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,414
'So I will end soon.
-Do you really need.

1007
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,057
Do not need it. You got me
and what we have is special.

1008
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,692
Open the door for her.

1009
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,858
We at  201 2.
It does have to open my door.

1010
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,691
I do not know, I feel like a new woman.

1011
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,732
I felt powerful, strong and...

1012
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,130
What about him?

1013
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,226
Well, I guess...

1014
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,464
Can Zeke dinner tomorrow night?

1015
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:25,935
It's him.

1016
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,274
'' You can have dinner tomorrow night?''

1017
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,403
Well, can you?

1018
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,175
I think I can.

1019
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,774
But do not go out with guys that I invite
per message.

1020
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,450
Do not go out with guys for SMS!

1021
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,051
It's crazy.

1022
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,589
Gail always suggested omelets
only with the clear, it is healthier.

1023
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,125
Can you put a shirt
while cooking?

1024
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,056
Woke up early.

1025
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,165
Where does all this brilliance?

1026
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,561
My friends.

1027
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,167
Hey, you got it.
Wow! At the first meeting?

1028
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,000
-Point for him.
-Is.

1029
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,400
I'm screwed.

1030
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,942
Neither  talked about my work.

1031
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,636
-You really like him.
-I do, yes.

1032
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,181
I do not know as it gets.

1033
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,345
And you know what?
I do not care!

1034
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,020
I believe in your dreams.

1035
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,155
She thinks I'm a chef on the rise.

1036
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,346
With a beautiful Mercedes.

1037
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,185
And a sexy chauffeur.
I was elegant,

1038
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:17,487
hat with the hand.

1039
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:20,424
People, she will run away when
discover the truth.

1040
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,428
Whatever you do, do not tell the truth
.

1041
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:23,566
-Right.
-You have to postpone.

1042
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,532
Damn, I would not count
before she becomes pregnant.

1043
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,297
-I can not do that.
-Don, I know.

1044
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,166
You are trying to do the right thing.
Trust me.

1045
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,707
Sincerity is overrated, man.
In the Bible. Old Testament.

1046
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,104
Only
do not want a relationship based on lies.

1047
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,440
That 'is called marriage.

1048
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,777
Don, you do not fool me.
I know what it is. Sex.

1049
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,512
You did right in the room.

1050
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,020
So come here every downcast

1051
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,715
and with low self-esteem.

1052
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,816
True.
When your performance is not good, your insecurity is visible.

1053
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:54,191
Know what happened? PP.
Lazy Pipi. That was it.

1054
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,628
Exactly. You need to apply correctly.

1055
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,499
Do not take it anymore. Enough is enough.
To me arrives.

1056
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:03,730
Dude, put a shirt!
No one else here, just us!

1057
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,539
You're telling me that she has a son?

1058
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:10,042
Yes! The Duke. He is six years.
A great kid, full of energy.

1059
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,238
That's a big responsibility, son.

1060
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,417
Well, she is a woman
very responsible mother.

1061
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,586
I'm not talking about it,
I'm talking about you.

1062
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:21,415
Do you really think that
is capable of dating a single mother?

1063
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,560
Well, I
I was raised by a single mother, no?

1064
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,090
Ah, but I'm only son.

1065
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,858
Trust me, Mom.
You will love it.

1066
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,669
Thank God!

1067
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,237
A familiar place.

1068
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,741
A place that has not changed,
which remains the same.

1069
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,604
J, what happened?

1070
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,373
My Fortress of Solitude
was invaded by a wave of bed and bath.

1071
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,743
-What does this mean?
-I said, he speaks in code.

1072
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,714
Kristen redecorating the house.

1073
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,683
Redecorated? Why did not it?

1074
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,721
No, she redecorated. She eliminated.

1075
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:55,949
My identity in the trash!

1076
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,684
My anime posters ,

1077
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,957
glasses of Battlestar Galactica
that you liked everything in the trash.

1078
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,222
I?

1079
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,765
Wait. She even asked?
Just threw it all away?

1080
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,027
-It seems that is taking over.
-It's crazy.

1081
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,364
I was feeling another person.

1082
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,872
Someone modern with a classic touch.

1083
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,806
You must be sick. It is an STD.

1084
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,071
You drank the beverage of Zeke.

1085
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,043
-And she threw off my couch!
-Thank God!

1086
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,307
God save Kristen!

1087
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,717
-He has many memories.
-So that smell?

1088
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,286
Yeah, we all fucked on that couch.

1089
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,412
Twice.

1090
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,023
-You had since college, right?
-Yes!

1091
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,218
Thing whitey.

1092
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,725
No, the thing Jeremy.
No, whitey thing.

1093
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,920
I graduated and got rid of my couch.

1094
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,258
What went right?

1095
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,096
DeVry, class of February. Valedictorian.

1096
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,291
Whose side are you on?

1097
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,472
No brother on earth would a sister hot

1098
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,233
sit on a couch stinky college.

1099
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,272
-Amen, brother!
-No matter what happens,

1100
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,936
needs to grow and buy furniture,
in several installments.

1101
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,708
Do not do it.
It's a black thing. Never do this.

1102
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,974
It's the same thing in black!

1103
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,276
Do you always buy things they can not afford.

1104
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,783
Ced, you could not afford your wedding!

1105
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,478
I am paying today.

1106
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:00,747
Listen, Kristen is a great girl.

1107
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,417
Do not spoil a good thing because of a couch, right?

1108
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:04,990
It is up to something.

1109
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,088
The game had started,

1110
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,696
but not what we were watching.

1111
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,927
As we sat watching the game,

1112
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,525
Our team was being beaten.

1113
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:17,336
The other team was creating plays, devising strategies

1114
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,634
and plotting their next moves.

1115
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,643
Still awake?

1116
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,178
I thought you were asleep.

1117
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,609
-I could not stop reading.
-Ah.

1118
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,220
Jeremy did not even know he was being attacked.

1119
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,950
Wow, something amazing happened today.
I found the brother of Sarah.

1120
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,162
And he told me he got a job at
Neversoft.

1121
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,623
Legal.

1122
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:43,756
It.

1123
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,892
Do not offered an internship there once?

1124
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,800
It.
I refused to accept a real job.

1125
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,309
Okay, that post below
he still holds today.

1126
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,799
What?

1127
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,174
My brothers knew nothing about war.

1128
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,254
They were distracted by the honeymoon phase.

1129
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,013
They were too busy having fun.

1130
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,249
Okay, who's hungry?

1131
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,591
I'm hungry, but get off, baby!

1132
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,228
Caramba! Look at that ass!

1133
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,590
Legal. She's hot.

1134
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,890
Guys, stop, she has no father.

1135
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,727
Wait, this is a single mother?
It is Candace?

1136
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,529
-Is Candace.
-I know a single mother.

1137
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,597
No, she is the best friend of Lauren.

1138
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,573
It seems they play basketball three times a week
,

1139
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:32,009
and Dominic said Michael
is very successful.

1140
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,944
Really?
-Point for you!

1141
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,119
Mandel right? You know what?

1142
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,710
The  Michael said Dominic
is an amazing chef.

1143
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,413
I know! I love food.

1144
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,115
-Oh, my friend.
-What?

1145
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,953
Can we hang out together.

1146
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,264
-That is not good.
-That is not good.

1147
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,798
Let's play basketball, folks.
-Yeah, come on.

1148
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,402
Whatever you do, do not leave together
.

1149
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,731
That's right. Ced...

1150
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:58,700
Really?

1151
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,474
I was getting changed.

1152
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,535
J, is making us lose!

1153
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,976
-I?
-Yeah, we're sinking.

1154
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,479
I talked to score.

1155
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,447
-You just hit a 27.
-A I got right was important.

1156
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:12,486
Enough. New teams next week.
I want to leave his team.

1157
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,122
Do not I who is not scoring!

1158
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:17,157
Excuse me, have ended?
We need all of the court.

1159
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,249
Yes, yes.
-Stay with it.

1160
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,053
No, not done.

1161
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:22,094
We still play a lot,

1162
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,392
then chose the wrong
court to take possession.

1163
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,829
We've played three times!

1164
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,833
Yeah, Ced, we have.
-Not just, no.

1165
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,131
Do not just. I'm sorry.

1166
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,273
And then will leak or not?

1167
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,669
It is, as we exit...

1168
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,811
Drain? What is this slang?

1169
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,343
Do not know anything more recent?

1170
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,277
For you and stronger version of the Prince

1171
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,713
not return to their side of the block
and do what they were doing?

1172
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,515
If you want to block,
will challenge us as real men.

1173
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:46,748
So you want to play against us.

1174
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,117
You heard me.

1175
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,617
Am I
speaking another language? Losers.

1176
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,795
-They will not defeat us. We are men!
-Ced.

1177
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:56,159
-You think you can take advantage of us.
-It's not serious.

1178
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,459
I am, yes. I never spoke so seriously.

1179
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,362
Oh, damn.

1180
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:06,703
I thought they were the only two.
I have not seen the others.

1181
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,878
Turn and apologize.

1182
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,546
-Too late.
-Apologize.

1183
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,511
I will not ask anything.
Michael, being a man is this!

1184
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:17,517
Okay, folks. If you want a game, a game will have
.

1185
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,710
Want to play?

1186
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,946
Ced, drop it!

1187
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,387
-Cedric!
-What are you doing?

1188
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,458
-Are you okay?
Get up.

1189
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,151
What an embarrassment.

1190
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,892
-I tried to catch it.
-We saw.

1191
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:31,861
I tried it.
I swear that I gave up on me.

1192
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,832
I hoped  the esophagus in the last game,
so I will not be able to play.

1193
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,962
The esophagus is the throat.

1194
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:37,733
-Shut up.
-Zeke, we need six.

1195
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,368
Forget Zeke,
will play with five.

1196
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,011
Listen, we're men.
We tied our shoes like them.

1197
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,113
The largest of them are.

1198
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,712
Does not matter. Be a man!

1199
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,249
Each one has to choose someone to mark
.

1200
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,715
Come. Defense.

1201
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,679
I March. Come on. Choose
. I've chosen.

1202
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,685
Everyone should be welcome to
JW Marriott Los Angeles.

1203
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,191
But then the truth came out.

1204
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,365
For Dominic, the situation changed
on Tuesday afternoon.

1205
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,523
... The best year in company history.

1206
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:09,535
It is not only the director of operations more
young woman who has had, but better.

1207
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,036
Ladies and gentlemen, Lauren Harris.

1208
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,270
Thank you.

1209
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,745
Oh, damn.

1210
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,215
Mother? THERE you are.
-Hi!

1211
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,549
Mother, I would like you to meet Candace.

1212
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,646
Hi!

1213
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,950
Michael received the pump on Wednesday.

1214
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,594
I have heard much about him.

1215
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,122
I have not heard anything about you!

1216
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,733
Talked about it at dinner yesterday. What...

1217
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,732
Well, I do not remember.
Mother, why are you...

1218
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,097
I do not remember.

1219
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,940
Your home is beautiful.
Wonderful. Best.

1220
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,914
Oh, wow, just look!
I have this same frame with a picture of my son!

1221
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,080
FlLHO NUMBER ONE!
The ASTRO

1222
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,818
Oh, yes, you're the one who has children.

1223
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,458
I want to ask you something, dear,

1224
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,760
what daddy your baby
think about you going out with my Michael?

1225
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,327
Or is he stuck?

1226
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,598
Everyone knows how to type
of people flee from responsibility.

1227
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,807
Arrested? No, why do you...

1228
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,307
Candace, want to see the rest of the house?

1229
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,980
Yes, why not show the house to Tandace
?

1230
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,808
Candace. My name is Candace.

1231
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,108
Tan... Tandace?

1232
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:31,477
It... Candace with a...

1233
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,414
I realize that she really likes you.

1234
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,592
Let's take a walk around the house.
-That we will.

1235
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,660
Come.

1236
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,194
They do not explain our relationship?

1237
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:43,457
I tried to capture all the special moments
between me and my big boy.

1238
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,463
There should
remember when I gave him the bracelet.

1239
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:50,162
In a town near Paris,
in a small jewelry store with cute...

1240
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,364
Do you remember his expression when you open the box?

1241
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,633
Yes, I know, I know.

1242
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,301
I thought we were in Milan

1243
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:56,672
No, we left the restaurant...

1244
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,543
Honey, you're in my room.
This is where the magic happens, baby.

1245
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,012
-Our.
What do you think?

1246
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,776
It's as if I had gone back in time.

1247
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,718
I keep everything the same way,
for when he sleeps here.

1248
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,152
Do you sleep here?

1249
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,690
On Sundays, my dear. Nothing much.

1250
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:15,331
And Sunday evenings
always been reserved for his mother.

1251
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,998
And always will be.

1252
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,364
I make his favorite dish,
and then play cards.

1253
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:24,699
Mom
is the best player of letters I know.

1254
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,843
A game of little note
inho zinho inha zinha

1255
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:29,769
Come.

1256
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,676
Do not do that, not in front of Candace.

1257
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,473
Let me get your clothes clean.

1258
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:34,775
Clean clothes?

1259
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,682
Let me help you with that, mother.
I need more socks, mother.

1260
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,184
They stink!

1261
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:43,223
But you know, do not care about the stench.
I just need to rub some more.

1262
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:47,385
Wash and scrub to clean.
Michael Nene will shine!

1263
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:50,590
FlLHlNHOS OF MOTHER

1264
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,165
excessively attached to their mothers

1265
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,562
do not want to grow,

1266
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:54,725
they can not compete

1267
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,664
Drugs.

1268
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,377
For Zeke, no'' cookie'' on Thursday.

1269
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,376
The night is young.
What do you do?

1270
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,683
This is our fifth meeting, right?

1271
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,880
Really? I do not know, I lost count.

1272
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,055
Lost it?

1273
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:20,556
How about a drink to relax?

1274
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,390
Okay.

1275
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,362
Yes

1276
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:31,472
It's kinda small, but I liked
because of French windows

1277
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,874
and being close to work.

1278
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:36,701
So...

1279
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,110
A beauty.

1280
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,412
Maybe we should look for a more comfortable place.

1281
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:45,776
Yes

1282
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,149
'Yes.
-Yes.

1283
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,083
'll Put a song.

1284
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:56,264
You know what? Maybe you should.
Choose the music you want.

1285
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,890
Legal.

1286
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,432
Do you have vinyl records?

1287
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:03,105
Yes, I'm a purist.

1288
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,274
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

1289
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:07,943
Do not go. I mean...

1290
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,778
Do not go.

1291
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,971
-I will not.
-Okay. Alright.

1292
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,448
Our. You really are a purist.

1293
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,818
How the hell did you get this on vinyl?

1294
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,182
No.

1295
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:52,177
How do you like your coffee?

1296
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:56,288
Zeke discovered the hard way,
which means a drink to relax

1297
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:57,550
a drink to relax.

1298
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,957
Three doses of Jack.

1299
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,229
You're so silly.

1300
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:09,994
Hi!

1301
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,730
Ah, Ced, why are you here?

1302
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:12,999
Do not have any milk.

1303
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:17,406
Hey, wanna ask you something seriously.
Do you think I look like the ldris Elba?

1304
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,139
The stripper club
Sweaty Crack told me last night,

1305
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,681
but I had a note with me,

1306
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,046
do not know if she tried to fool me.

1307
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,719
Do not respond. Do not worry.

1308
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,513
I felt good when she said that.

1309
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,692
Looks like someone was invited to spend the night
. How was it?

1310
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:30,826
We had coffee.

1311
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:32,858
?
-Eat biscuits.

1312
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,088
E?

1313
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,324
And we talked about our childhoods, art and music

1314
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:41,699
and on Plato's Allegory of the Cave.
What the hell is this?

1315
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:43,030
It's actually pretty deep.

1316
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,504
Lgual the book by Bishop Don Magic Juan
wisdom on the streets,

1317
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:47,835
which is a great read.

1318
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,638
Five meetings and just got a coffee.
What is her problem?

1319
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,371
It is not the problem.
What's wrong with you?

1320
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,517
It seems that the stallion
is losing its charm.

1321
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,481
I'm in a relationship without sex,

1322
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,019
when
all I want is sex without a relationship.

1323
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,349
When you see it again?

1324
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,218
Saturday night. Do not mess.

1325
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:05,555
Good job.

1326
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:09,095
Hey, Zeke, when up there, take a look at
toilet,

1327
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,858
because it seems that is clogged,
but not sure.

1328
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,502
Do not know where the plunger was,
then do not be surprised to see the stretch.

1329
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:16,594
It's full.

1330
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,903
-We were up all night...
-Okay.

1331
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,042
... And talk about everything.

1332
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,506
You left without the cookie?

1333
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,777
But, of course.
-Legal.

1334
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,574
I can not say it was easy.

1335
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:30,748
I do not know when he kissed me, as if we were
sex.

1336
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,515
So, thanks for your advice about
panties.

1337
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:35,648
What did you use?

1338
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:38,257
-A grandma.
The big one-granny style?

1339
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,326
I told her that her panties ugly work.

1340
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,057
-You would not listen.
-And it worked.

1341
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:46,531
Now that you know is not just a theory,
think you can last 90 days?

1342
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:47,930
Monique!

1343
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,329
It's Mya!

1344
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:50,594
Call me!

1345
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,267
You Mya, asshole!

1346
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,981
Yes I can certainly last longer than 4 days 7.

1347
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:02,645
Okay, Monique.

1348
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,821
-I'll cancel the meeting.
-Why?

1349
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,785
He works as a waiter part-time.

1350
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,482
Can I remind you, Miss. lmportante, we were waitresses

1351
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:13,994
for two years at Olive Garden?

1352
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,962
Candace, we were in college.

1353
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,258
I'm talking about a grown man,

1354
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:21,995
parking to be admitted that the Mercedes he used to follow me.

1355
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,563
It's kind of romantic.

1356
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,331
It's kind of pathetic.

1357
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,940
I thought I did not care about money.

1358
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,508
I thought you believed in his dream.

1359
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,145
Not in- absurd. As if!
-Okay, okay.

1360
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,747
Freedom is the first guy who treats you well

1361
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:34,942
just because he does not win as well.

1362
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,582
Please, he does not earn much.

1363
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,846
And I can not invest time in something

1364
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:42,151
that
I do not bring profit for my time and effort.

1365
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:43,518
You heard what you said?

1366
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:46,857
Dominic is a person, Lauren,
and not a stock portfolio.

1367
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:50,658
As Steve Harvey says,
there is a perfect man.

1368
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,665
You have to accept some defects.
What you got to lose?

1369
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,499
My youth.

1370
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:56,933
Wait. She canceled the meeting?

1371
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,301
It would cancel.
Was interrupted by his boss.

1372
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,306
-What the hell.
-You know what?

1373
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:05,605
Who cares about the success of her
and the board that she run it?

1374
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:09,216
take an honest living and pay my taxes. Most of the time.

1375
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:10,849
You know what, Don? I agree.

1376
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,021
I am also American and I agree with you, brother.

1377
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,111
Me too.

1378
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,550
We give full support.

1379
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,350
-And then, Mike?
-Okay?

1380
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,187
How was everything between Candace and her mother?

1381
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,455
It...

1382
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:21,858
I will slow down with Michael.

1383
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,797
-Why?
-He already has a woman in your life.

1384
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:26,728
Oh, that bastard. Who is she?

1385
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,200
-Your mother.
-What?

1386
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,206
My mother thinks she's cool.

1387
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,641
Oh, I know.
No woman is good enough for his mother.

1388
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,714
Do you think she'll like
just a single mother?

1389
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,646
-Good luck.
-Listen to this.

1390
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:47,414
'' You can redial the day at the beach?
I promised I would take my mother to the school choir.''

1391
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:50,387
I can not do that to me again,
and will not do that with Duke.

1392
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,754
Deserve a man to commit himself entirely.

1393
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,395
So imposes standards.

1394
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:57,566
Oh, my God,
not believe I'm quoting that book ridiculous.

1395
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:01,066
Tell Michael
not want to interfere in his relationship with his mother

1396
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,431
and if you want to go out with you,

1397
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,698
you must become a priority in his life.

1398
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,206
She was a lifetime.
I can not compete with that.

1399
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,538
Then, drop the first guy in three years

1400
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,681
who really likes you and Duke.

1401
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,283
Wait, there
a perfect man, is not it?

1402
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,747
What you got to lose?

1403
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,754
Not what you told me the whole night?

1404
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,147
Right.

1405
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,352
I will continue if you continue.

1406
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,519
It was the worst moment.

1407
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,495
The boys were being attacked with full force.

1408
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,964
But everything changed on Day D.

1409
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,627
FOR A FABRlCA butts

1410
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:45,203
Tell me one thing.
How do you feel like a free man?

1411
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,211
Great. Okay, listen,

1412
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:48,681
-I do what I want...
-Yes.

1413
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,648
-... When I want, with whomever I wish.
-Okay.

1414
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,082
I am free of all cop-nia''''...

1415
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,779
-Is'' tyranny.''
-Shut up, Bennett.

1416
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:57,290
-Let him finish.
-I'm just appreciating the grammar.

1417
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,759
Okay!
I am free from all tyranny and oppression.

1418
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:02,490
And the boring
all women forever. Understood?

1419
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:05,428
So
the only woman I want to talk today

1420
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,296
The dancer is
Factory naked butts.

1421
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,370
What happened to the Sweaty Crack?

1422
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,562
-Closed. Sanitary violations.
-I've heard.

1423
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:14,105
But what matters is that I prefer
Factory butts,

1424
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,540
because the girls are naughty.
The way I like.

1425
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:17,635
Ced! Ced.

1426
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,247
Do not judge me!
I am going through a divorce, a friend.

1427
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,349
Hey Lauren
confirmed our meeting tomorrow.

1428
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:23,813
I thought you were finished.

1429
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,351
Why are meddling in his life?

1430
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:26,953
My friend said they broke up with her.

1431
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,453
You have been tamed!

1432
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,523
More than that, Mike.
-Stop it.

1433
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:31,886
-Wanna hear a good story?
-No.

1434
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,985
Ced, tell them about the night that saved
Gail.

1435
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,963
I'll finish with you
a damn bottle of Gail speak again.

1436
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:41,296
Do not wanna talk about Gail.
I want to talk about breasts and butt!

1437
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,836
It's Candace. I must meet?

1438
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,474
No, man! Give me the phone.
Friends come before women.

1439
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,144
Hi Candace. Hey, there, girl?

1440
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,505
-Michael.
-I was thinking of you.

1441
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,807
No, hi, I thought I'd drop in the mailbox.

1442
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,381
No, I answered, dear.

1443
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:56,812
Look, Michael.

1444
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,948
We need to talk.

1445
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:04,024
Few words are more threatening than
.:'' We need to talk.''

1446
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:08,127
That means we did something wrong

1447
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:12,529
or you literally want to talk.

1448
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,395
-She wants to talk.
-This is new.

1449
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:16,493
That's bad, man.

1450
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:18,596
Great! Hopefully
chatter until you get bored.

1451
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:20,571
There is something good in a woman want to talk?

1452
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,744
No. Not that I know.

1453
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:26,813
Kris used to be alright
and now everything she does is argue with me,

1454
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,849
pentelhando me with:
'' What are your immediate goals?''

1455
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:33,317
What are your ultimate goals?
Jeremy, what do you think of relationships?''

1456
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:35,012
I'm playing Call of Duty...

1457
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:37,249
Wait, go back to tape. What did you say?

1458
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,294
The ultimate goals, immediate... Do not make me

1459
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,862
-repeat.
Yes, that's crazy. Do you know?

1460
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:43,693
Candace
asked me the same things at the first meeting.

1461
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,196
Mya asked me the same thing.

1462
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:46,425
And Lauren too.

1463
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:48,729
You know what?
Do you know who asked me that?

1464
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,771
No one! Strippers do not ask me anything!

1465
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,809
She  told me the other day,''
I'm not a fish in the sea.''

1466
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:57,069
What is this?

1467
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,440
A trophy. To show your friends.

1468
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,479
What the hell are you talking about Bennett?

1469
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:02,551
I was watching Oprah.

1470
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,175
-Why watch Oprah?
-I like.

1471
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,846
Appears saying that a gay party in a divorce.

1472
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,048
Steve Harvey was in the program.

1473
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:11,058
He wrote a book.
It's for women but about men.

1474
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,592
-The Steve Harvey Family Feud?
-I heard something about it.

1475
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,096
He betrayed us like this?
How rude. I would not.

1476
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,563
I thought he was a friend, but...

1477
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,792
Me too.
-What?

1478
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:20,559
-You what?
-I said nothing.

1479
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,330
Tell me exactly what it says in the book.

1480
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:24,530
A lot of junk.

1481
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:28,038
This is why we are
ruining my party. Because of this.

1482
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:30,872
I found the book on the internet.
I found a critical...

1483
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,274
I need to get this book.

1484
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:33,778
No, do not do that now.

1485
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,076
-You told friends before women. A second-
.

1486
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,980
Guess what?
The friend needs a wife!

1487
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:39,711
My pocket is full of money

1488
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,050
and I'm not in his underwear.

1489
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,315
I do not wear underwear today.

1490
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:44,757
Should be my companions.
Come, join me!

1491
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,090
Celebrate, men! Take your...
Please join me, men! Damn it!

1492
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:50,421
This does not good.

1493
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,157
Yes, we looked for a book called...

1494
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,060
Behave Like a Lady, Think Like a Man
.

1495
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,671
Behave Like a Lady, Think Like a Man
. Sold out? Thank you.

1496
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,308
They say  is sold out a week ago.

1497
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,669
Great.
-There may be exhausted.

1498
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,936
'They have neither on eBay.
-It's the power of Oprah.

1499
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:06,776
I've got something.
Right. Where is San Pablo?

1500
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:07,906
On the boundary of Oregon.

1501
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:09,276
That does not work out.

1502
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,282
: It seems we tried.
Hi. Now?

1503
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:12,649
Tomorrow is another day.
Try again.

1504
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,780
Time-strip!
-I can bring home to mom?

1505
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,914
Driver, go to my house?

1506
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,787
I thought it was going to cancel with her mom.

1507
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,484
Have you tried to cancel with my mother, Ced?

1508
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:22,323
I will say, since nobody else wants to speak
, Michael.

1509
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,167
Have you tried to become a heterosexual?

1510
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:32,041
Mommy!

1511
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:32,939
Mommy!

1512
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,037
I made your favorite.

1513
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,838
The smell is great.
-Look at that, eh?

1514
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,448
Let me get a chicken.
Let me get a chicken!

1515
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,847
Stop. You know I love
sauteed onions and cornbread.

1516
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,818
I know. I'll get a plate for you, but clean everything before
.

1517
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:51,151
Right.
And make sure that the sweet potato pie...

1518
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,191
You can leave, little, just wipe the counter.

1519
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:55,962
Mommy, what is this?

1520
01:08:56,499 --> 01:09:00,492
It is the book that bald
participating in the show Family Feud.

1521
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,330
Act in a way,
Think of another.

1522
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:03,527
The book for the club.

1523
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,367
Every war has its turn.

1524
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,868
In the Civil War,
was the Battle of Gettysburg.

1525
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,347
In World War II,
was the invasion of Normandy.

1526
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:18,047
The
turn this war was that night at the home of Loretta.

1527
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,414
It was like finding the Holy Grail.

1528
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:22,420
Jeremy . Ask the bus to turn around.

1529
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,594
The power was in our favor.
We did not know it yet.

1530
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,523
'' Why Men Do That '.
'' Look at that.

1531
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,197
Steve Harvey is a traitor.

1532
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:31,923
Look,'''' Little children of the Mother.
Chapter 7. It's you.

1533
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,192
I'm not a mama's boy.

1534
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,496
Jer, do not think I'm one, is not it?

1535
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,034
-No.
-Listen it.

1536
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,173
'' Men respect standards, create some.''
I prefer women without.

1537
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:42,175
Actually, if I had to choose, choose a
no standards.

1538
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,906
Look. '' Until it achieves its goals are near or
,

1539
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,105
'' will never be number one in his life.''

1540
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:48,613
See, this is not true.

1541
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,786
Not won anything yet and prioritize my women.

1542
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:53,716
Doing this is terrible-.
-It's brainwashing.

1543
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:57,518
You are trying to lead me to my dreams
and help me reach my goals.

1544
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:58,854
Why would she do this?

1545
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,258
At least you're having sex.

1546
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:03,391
Ninety days, this is not a test,
is a death sentence.

1547
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:04,761
I wanna taste your cherry.

1548
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,166
Hey Mike, how old is your mother?

1549
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,258
What?

1550
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:11,937
No, not that. No, it does. That's right.
How old is she?

1551
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,441
I go and she says,'' Want to eat?''
I say,'' Eat what?''

1552
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:17,111
Drop the plate and stop giving the top of my
mother's face.

1553
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:18,770
Do not be mad!
I do not want to be here.

1554
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,906
Do you want that is,
I want to go to a strip club!

1555
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,482
To Complete this soon. I have several notes of a
and someone will take it from me.

1556
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:28,214
Miss. Loretta!
I am ready for you to show me the house.

1557
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:34,592
You are so screwed.
And there's nothing they can do.

1558
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:35,786
Maybe we can do something.

1559
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,990
They have a book about our secrets.
You know everything about us.

1560
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:43,069
Yes, but do not know what we know
who know our secrets.

1561
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:44,864
Saw that not only go out with Jeremy?

1562
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,236
I never know what he's talking about.

1563
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:50,503
It's like the Patriots, Bill Belichick when
robs the play of the Jets.

1564
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:52,681
-Were caught and punished.
-But won the game.

1565
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,679
And where gone? In the Super Bowl.

1566
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:57,283
I would like to know what you mean.

1567
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,420
We will use the words of Steve Harvey against them.

1568
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:02,489
Pretend to give what they want, and
get what we want.

1569
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:03,847
We'll lie to them.

1570
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,453
Exactly. We are at war, gentlemen.
There are no rules.

1571
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:11,258
As the great Khan said, not Genghis,

1572
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:13,594
I'm talking about the Latin Star Trek ll.

1573
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,100
'' Revenge is a dish best served cold. ''

1574
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:18,796
Michael, I must admit one thing.

1575
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,135
You know what?
Before admitting anything,

1576
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,972
I must admit something.

1577
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:25,043
You know I can be a mama's boy?

1578
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,112
I think it all started when my father died.

1579
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,843
It was a difficult time for us, you know?

1580
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:36,957
And my mother began to tell me more
. Count me too.

1581
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:41,351
You know, I had to be
the man of the house still young

1582
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,030
and that's why we are so close.

1583
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,154
Michael.

1584
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,525
I think what I'm trying to say is

1585
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:51,001
I want to be the woman
number one in my life.

1586
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,606
It was like making a test
for which already had answers.

1587
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:57,010
You are my priority, Candace.
Are you okay?

1588
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,337
Yes

1589
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:01,208
Right.
You said you wanted to talk about something.

1590
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,043
I said?

1591
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:08,421
The women had no chance.
We assume the command.

1592
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:13,220
I updated my resume and sent it to Neversoft.

1593
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:15,218
Really?

1594
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,421
Are you serious?

1595
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,830
I was intrigued by an ad in Adweek
I saw and thought:

1596
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,697
'' Why not try, Jeremy?
You have nothing to lose.''

1597
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:26,204
Dear, this is wonderful, very good.
I am very proud of you.

1598
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,034
My God-.
-Nothing excitement, okay?

1599
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,007
Just sent my resume.
They probably will not call me.

1600
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,578
You're underestimating.

1601
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:36,217
Jeremy, you're the best in its class
Parsons, is a brilliant designer.

1602
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:39,182
No. You're a brilliant artist.
They would be lucky to have him.

1603
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,084
I'm lucky to have him.

1604
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:43,955
Do you?

1605
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:46,954
Know what was I thinking?

1606
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,085
What?

1607
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,855
No one has slept on this couch.

1608
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:51,289
What?

1609
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,234
-No, it's a sofa virgin.
-Really?

1610
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:55,630
What should we do about it?

1611
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,430
I can think of a dozen things.

1612
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:58,563
Only ten?

1613
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,875
Will be screaming like crazy after the third.

1614
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,407
Now I'm scared.

1615
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:03,770
I love this couch.

1616
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:07,142
After a careful study,
Dominic saw that there was only one man

1617
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:08,580
impressed that  Alpha Women.

1618
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,445
'' The Man With Potential.'' Zeke.

1619
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,643
What?
-I have to show that I have a plan.

1620
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:14,482
-Lnvente some crap, man.
-No.

1621
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,123
-Remember the idea of ??the restaurant?
-Yes.

1622
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:18,054
Help me with a business plan.

1623
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,887
Cook for her. Jerk.

1624
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,222
I already did that. Breakfast.

1625
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,832
I'm not talking about breakfast, man!
Something chic, Don!

1626
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:29,668
One of those dishes with apostrophe in the name.

1627
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:30,930
This is your robe?

1628
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:32,796
Yes

1629
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:33,930
Dude, you're here again?

1630
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:37,771
Yes! The Factory butts does not open until 22h
I have time until then.

1631
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,244
Slut-, move here.
What do you say?

1632
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,778
I like being with my friends when I'm
divorced.

1633
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:45,012
What was I thinking?

1634
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:46,485
You're from another world, man.

1635
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:49,557
Gail used to love when I cooked for her. That 'excited her.

1636
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,385
You can do several things in the kitchen.

1637
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,083
Was something we did with the food.

1638
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:55,525
I picked strawberries covered with chocolate, right?

1639
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:58,723
And I descended using a G-string thong.

1640
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,235
Know what I mean. She loved it.

1641
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,429
The game was the'' Strawberry Swing''.

1642
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,004
I put the strawberries in...

1643
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,034
But the way it is...

1644
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:13,606
The strawberry
will not be there long, so...

1645
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,449
What I'm trying to say is this, Sun

1646
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:21,282
Food is his art.
Use it to win Lauren.

1647
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:24,748
It's a good milk, Zeke.

1648
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:27,884
He's right.

1649
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,121
I will.

1650
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:31,333
-Over.
-Wait, what happened?

1651
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,630
-Over.
-Wait, what happened?

1652
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,860
Dominic's car broke down.

1653
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,560
I have to go get him?

1654
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,000
So? Calm down. Do you know how many times

1655
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,937
I got him when his Jaguar broke?

1656
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,404
You can stop, Candace.

1657
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:42,941
The guy is a loser.

1658
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:45,809
I am the fool who slept with him.
On the first night.

1659
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:49,711
Something he will be remembered with pride for ever
,

1660
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:53,718
it never happen again. Never.

1661
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:58,748
Hey, beautiful.

1662
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:01,486
Dominic.

1663
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:06,298
You are beautiful.

1664
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,299
Yes, I mentioned that.

1665
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,841
-I would like a glass of wine?
-Actually came here to...

1666
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,271
This is a Chateau Montelena, 2006.

1667
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,780
Won first
in the Judgment of Paris in 1976.

1668
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:25,681
Actually,
was the Chardonnay that won 73,

1669
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:28,152
but I heard that this is better.

1670
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:29,846
It was a gift.

1671
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:33,818
But I wanted to save it
for a special occasion.

1672
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,495
Well, thank you.

1673
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:40,759
Then

1674
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,159
a toast to this night.

1675
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,029
Yes

1676
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:51,609
Oh, my God.

1677
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,178
Doing this is good.

1678
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,945
Yes, and there's more.

1679
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,064
You did this to me?

1680
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:28,810
Good evening, miss.

1681
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:30,877
Wild...

1682
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:32,545
-Damn.
-Face...

1683
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,551
I'm sorry. Very much.

1684
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,257
'' Wild Mushroom en Crout''?

1685
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,583
Croute.

1686
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:40,951
Croute?

1687
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:43,353
Thank you.

1688
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,658
-Enjoy your dinner.
-Thank you.

1689
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:55,936
I would like to stop seeing me
like a waiter serving hors d'oeuvres.

1690
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,440
What do you think?

1691
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,604
LncrIvel .

1692
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:04,115
As you.

1693
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,380
Thank you.

1694
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,258
And watch the stars.

1695
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,359
Make a wish.

1696
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,388
Okay.

1697
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,697
You will not make a request?

1698
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:30,973
Is not necessary.

1699
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:49,559
And that night, Zeke was
on a completely different mission.

1700
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,426
Do not tell me what I said. I know.

1701
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,498
-But I'm telling you, eventually.
-What?

1702
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,431
Do not agree with this rule 90 days.

1703
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:56,934
You have the ammunition needed.

1704
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,766
Dear, I'll rise.

1705
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:02,834
Okay, listen.

1706
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:07,778
Use'' as'' men show their love
against it to get the wafer.

1707
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,507
Confess your love.
Call it girlfriend.

1708
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,413
Stop. Do you have any idea what I spent?

1709
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,111
I am tired of paying the account and open doors,

1710
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:16,313
and feelings and talk about our childhoods.

1711
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,254
It's like  in the '50s, man! I just want sex.

1712
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,088
And if she thinks another 7
wait to have sex one day,

1713
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,196
-she waits alone.
-Are you counting?

1714
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,958
I'm not telling,
but you know the number of days...

1715
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,294
You really like it.

1716
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,470
No, man, trust me. It's over, okay?

1717
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:30,797
I'll end this now.

1718
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,439
Yes, have fun on your date.

1719
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,438
I'll give you a kick in the rear of 90 days of it.

1720
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,105
Listen.

1721
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,709
Mya, on tonight...

1722
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:41,940
Okay, got a surprise.

1723
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:43,441
Do you?

1724
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:46,621
Yes, I bought tickets for
John Legend's concert at the Nokia Theatre.

1725
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,022
Okay, cool.

1726
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,348
Yes

1727
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:55,019
-Right.
-Okay. So, come on.

1728
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:05,005
I hope you do not get mad at me,

1729
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:08,540
But my uncle is a music producer
and I gave him your CD.

1730
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:09,733
You took my CD?

1731
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:13,037
Yes, and the three gum stuck in it.

1732
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,478
You know what?
I was looking for chewing gum.

1733
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:19,484
I've had enough of the music industry, right?
I love what I do.

1734
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,986
Okay, Zeke,
he is not forcing him to sign anything.

1735
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,590
Just want new songs for the album you're working.

1736
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,489
Yes, my album got a disk''
'' brass, okay?

1737
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,664
Two people heard and both were related.

1738
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:33,562
True, but I was praising
and he decided to listen.

1739
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:36,233
Should have been my agent.

1740
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:39,707
Zeke!

1741
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,843
Zeke stallion! And here, man?

1742
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:45,012
-Man, hi, and then... Xavier!
-And here, man?

1743
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:48,444
My lord . Honey, this is Zeke.
The guy who taught me to dance.

1744
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,174
The Chimichanga!
It was he who taught me.

1745
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:51,716
This is my girl, Crystal.

1746
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,945
So, Crystal? How are you?

1747
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,124
Oh, sorry. Xavier, this is...

1748
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:02,791
Ladies, if a man
to present as a friend

1749
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:05,728
understand, you're nothing more than that.

1750
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:09,529
If a man has
plans for the future with you, he'll confess.

1751
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,399
It will add a title to his name.

1752
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:16,441
You will be his wife,
his girl, his bride or...

1753
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,773
My girlfriend, Mya.

1754
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,415
Zeke realized that he could reach far beyond

1755
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:28,715
with a good confession than six wonderful encounters.

1756
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,224
Oh, my God.

1757
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,590
I think we should stop.

1758
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,965
I need to get up early.

1759
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:46,603
I better go.

1760
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:48,770
Okay.

1761
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:50,236
Good night!

1762
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,311
I could walk with you until...

1763
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,915
No, you can leave. I'm fine, good night!

1764
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,783
The
boys may have lost some battles but the war earned.

1765
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:01,751
I'm telling you, Gina. It worked.

1766
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,425
He ??is finally trying to get a good job.

1767
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:06,753
Family Feud knows what he's talking about?

1768
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:07,884
I changed our relationship.

1769
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,053
Zeke is in a relationship.

1770
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:10,222
How this affects the rule of 90 days?

1771
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,425
The rule of 90 days
was what brought me here.

1772
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,501
What I mean is
that I am not opposed to change it

1773
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:16,966
for good behavior.

1774
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,299
How to change the relationship status on Facebook?

1775
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,441
That 'shows good behavior,

1776
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,133
but it still will not win the'' cookie''

1777
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,042
Unless you say the three magic words.

1778
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,977
I hope you are ready for fun in praiao.

1779
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:29,445
Ah, yes, fun in praiao.

1780
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:33,118
Wait. Honey, should meet?
Is the work.

1781
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:34,780
Yes, all right.

1782
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:38,151
Do not! Why should I answer calls
working with you with me?

1783
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,251
Do not worry about it.
-No work.

1784
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,027
-You're right, Duke?
-Yes.

1785
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,291
Do you have your license?
For you will drive back in, right?

1786
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,471
I'm kidding.

1787
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:54,732
How romantic.

1788
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,535
Things were going too well.

1789
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,646
The
boys had even forgotten that they were at war.

1790
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:06,042
Okay, thank you, guys.
I am Danny Vola.

1791
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,484
Go up there and sing.
Come on, you should...

1792
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,248
No, do not sing for years, sit there.

1793
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:13,018
Wait, slow down! Sure, Duke!

1794
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,890
-All right, you can.
-Care!

1795
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,657
Will buy a bike like that to you, dear.

1796
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,829
Ah, want one?

1797
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:47,691
Sorry it took me, dear.
One of the boys needed some advice.

1798
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,927
Where were we?

1799
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:51,459
Right here.

1800
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,232
But then things started to go wrong.

1801
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,927
What happened with that job at Neversoft?

1802
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:03,603
I forgot to tell you,
heard rumors that they filled the position.

1803
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,405
Really?

1804
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:08,241
Yes

1805
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:11,945
How strange,

1806
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:17,382
since talked with the younger brother of Sarah...

1807
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:19,886
-Yes?
-... In LinkedIn.

1808
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,962
And he said that the position was still open.

1809
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,323
-Really?
-Yes.

1810
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,128
And he
personally recommend it to your boss.

1811
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,306
But his resume was not received.

1812
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:34,130
What?

1813
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,807
I waited all this time.

1814
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,676
You know what?
I had to restart the modem the other day.

1815
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:43,976
I bet you did not receive my e-mail.

1816
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:47,313
I'll fix it tomorrow morning.

1817
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:50,952
You are blaming the internet?

1818
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,486
It happens all the time.

1819
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,889
Kris?

1820
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,293
The truth was coming out.

1821
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:08,908
I'll miss you.

1822
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:11,778
It's mine, right. Even more.

1823
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,947
Right.

1824
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:01,217
James?

1825
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,361
-James Merrill?
-Lauren Harris.

1826
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,231
Wow, look at you.

1827
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:07,828
Look at you.

1828
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:13,303
It's like a fine wine.
It gets better with age, is not it?

1829
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:16,477
And you more charming.
What are you doing in LA?

1830
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:20,637
I'm renting an apartment.
I was promoted to executive director of Sensala.

1831
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:22,572
-Our.
-Yes.

1832
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:23,684
I'm moving to LA.

1833
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:24,909
-Are you kidding?
-No.

1834
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:28,113
Nina I can not imagine moving from Chicago.

1835
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,018
Well, it will not change.

1836
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:32,650
We are finalizing our divorce.

1837
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:35,162
-Really?
-Yes.

1838
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:38,127
-I'm sorry.
No, okay.

1839
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,698
-We are still friends.
-That is good.

1840
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,461
Do you? You are engaged? Married?

1841
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:46,139
No. Not engaged or married.

1842
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:47,672
Really?

1843
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,503
Only dating, but nothing serious.

1844
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:51,371
So what about dinner?

1845
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,472
Course.

1846
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,546
I want you. I mean, I dine with you.

1847
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,077
So I have to call.

1848
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:00,686
-It's the same number?
-The same.

1849
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:02,083
-Right. Call me-
.

1850
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,155
Tomorrow night, .
-Absolutely.

1851
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,921
-I liked the car.
-I also.

1852
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:08,186
I liked the format.

1853
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:10,157
From car.

1854
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,167
-I hate to bother you...
Go away!

1855
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,501
I saw this episode yesterday at home mom.
It's very funny.

1856
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,402
There had been called back to work last night?

1857
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,907
Ah, yes, last night I went to work,

1858
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:26,205
but said I had to go in the house of Mama

1859
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:30,248
to get things that she had left...
I told you, dear.

1860
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,013
No, do not think you...
-Give me a kiss. You did not hear me.

1861
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:35,487
And the lies were increasing.

1862
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,181
My mother is planning a big family reunion.

1863
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,520
-I would love if you were.
-What you want, dear.

1864
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:41,786
-Really?
-Course.

1865
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:45,957
The only problem is if your mother and grandmother are beautiful as you
,

1866
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,135
you can have competition there.

1867
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:49,462
Come here.

1868
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:51,694
Cool!

1869
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:52,999
It is in the park in Culver City.

1870
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,301
You'll have a trampoline and barbecue.

1871
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:58,536
These walls have ears.
Duke, go back to bed.

1872
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:04,349
So, it will be on the 20th and will be great.

1873
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:06,281
We will have cotton candy machines...

1874
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:09,047
20-Day this month? -
Carousel...

1875
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:11,191
Honey, can not in 20 days.

1876
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:12,652
Why?

1877
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:16,792
Actually, it's
anniversary of the church of my mother and promised her...

1878
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,363
Really? You must be kidding!

1879
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,033
Good night, Duke!

1880
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,497
I'll see what I can do, right?

1881
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:23,671
-Right.
-I'll fix.

1882
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:25,065
Come here, girl, come on.

1883
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:28,572
Turns out the only problem
pretending to take a step forward

1884
01:27:28,776 --> 01:27:31,176
is that sometimes you even need to.

1885
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:34,576
Keep an eye on it.
Pay attention, this will jump...

1886
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:42,152
Okay, what?

1887
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:47,724
Right.
I wanted to wait until we were in the restaurant

1888
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:51,157
but I spoke to my uncle last night

1889
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:54,597
and he heard his CD and loved it.

1890
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:58,260
He is obsessed with track seven,
and want to find him on Tuesday!

1891
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,633
Congratulations!

1892
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:02,569
My God. You did it for me?

1893
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:06,838
No, you did.
You put your heart in the range.

1894
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:08,907
I love you, girl.

1895
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:15,987
Even unwittingly

1896
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:18,854
Zeke made a mistake and said the three magic words

1897
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,891
finally opened the cookie jar.

1898
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,951
But Zeke's victory was short lived.

1899
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,998
MYA  - FUL BUY THE BREAKFAST NOW TURN
- Zeke

1900
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:24,123
This is not good.

1901
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:27,624
No, no, no.

1902
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:32,031
RULE OF NINETY DlAS
Getting the Respect it Deserves

1903
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:48,849
I'm crazy or
last night was the best of my life?

1904
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,176
'' You got the cookie.''

1905
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:54,685
Cracker? I am the eater of cookies.
Do you know what I bought? Coffee with milk...

1906
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,858
Mya, I can explain it.

1907
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,530
Your lying piece of shit!

1908
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:07,298
I was just using it in self defense.

1909
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:09,026
If defending against what?

1910
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,159
Against the Rule of 90 days.

1911
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:13,136
It was created to protect women against
idiots like you.

1912
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,038
So I'm the villain
and you do not have the courage

1913
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:17,077
to say that I was
on a 90 day trial.

1914
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:18,371
-I would say.
-When?

1915
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:22,642
I'd tell you.
But then I thought I could change it.

1916
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:27,687
Because I thought you were the right guy.

1917
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:29,653
Something was real?

1918
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:34,390
Something? Dinners, Exits?
Call me his girlfriend?

1919
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:36,426
Or was it just to get a cookie?

1920
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:39,791
Our.

1921
01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:42,667
You won, congratulations.

1922
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:45,672
You did it, right? You win.

1923
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,602
Mya, wait a minute.
Mya was all true.

1924
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:49,401
Zeke, do not touch me!

1925
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:51,943
God, you're so good.

1926
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:54,211
You're pretty good.

1927
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:57,111
Because even though I know you're lying,

1928
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,353
I can almost believe you.

1929
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:05,516
In The Art of War, Sun Tzu wrote.:
'' All war is based on deception. ''

1930
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:08,593
He forgot to say.:
'' Only fools are caught. ''

1931
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:09,030
Work Phone 310-555-0162

1932
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,019
Work Phone 310-555-0162

1933
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,562
Dear, your phone!

1934
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:15,264
Meanwhile, Candace needed
or find the book to understand everything.

1935
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,528
Phone Michael Atwater.

1936
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:18,394
Tandace?

1937
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:19,495
Loretta?

1938
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:24,543
Look, I'm calling to tell Michael
he does not need to take me to church.

1939
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:27,777
Deacon Johnson will take me.

1940
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,041
Let me talk to him. He is free?

1941
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,718
He will.

1942
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:34,054
Here goes! That dunk!

1943
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:35,552
Michael.

1944
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,050
Can I say something to you?

1945
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:40,655
What is it?

1946
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:41,851
You'll see.

1947
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,089
Duke, go inside.

1948
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,228
Darling, saw the skills this kid?

1949
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:46,491
If I continue...

1950
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:47,827
What happened, honey?

1951
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:50,600
His work called.

1952
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:53,501
I thought it might be an emergency and answered it.

1953
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,233
But it was only his mother.

1954
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:58,603
Really? You know, the list of contacts
is giving you problems...

1955
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:00,110
No more nonsense, Michael.

1956
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,248
Honey, I know that sounds, but trust me...

1957
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:04,447
Believe? I trusted you.

1958
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:08,515
I can not compete with her mother. And I'm not going.

1959
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:09,849
You do not have to...

1960
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,991
So why lie to my face?

1961
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:16,827
You need to go.

1962
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:18,823
Honey, listen...

1963
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,499
Get out my face, Michael.

1964
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:31,277
And Candace
was not the only things that solved that day.

1965
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:32,639
Hi, beautiful.

1966
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:35,281
Hi.
-How are you?

1967
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,879
-I have a meeting at a 4h, then...
-You are beautiful.

1968
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:40,414
Thank you.

1969
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:43,047
You said you had news.

1970
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:45,725
Yes
investor knows the friend of whom I spoke?

1971
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:50,125
He read its prospectus ,
and loved whatever you call it.

1972
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:51,825
Really?

1973
01:32:51,999 --> 01:32:53,694
I said I was fantastic.

1974
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,169
Thank you. Thank you.

1975
01:32:57,438 --> 01:33:00,032
We have to celebrate. Let's go out tonight.

1976
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,970
I'm not free tonight.

1977
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:04,804
Okay, and tomorrow night?

1978
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:07,741
Dominic, I'll be honest with you, right?

1979
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:11,009
I rediscovered an ex-boyfriend
of my college days.

1980
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:14,745
He ended up divorcing
and is moving to LA and I...

1981
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:16,883
's Up with me?

1982
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:20,254
Do not! I'm not ending,
I'm just taking a break.

1983
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:21,826
-I need space.
-Space.

1984
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:25,328
-We were going too fast...
-You are talking like a man.

1985
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:26,522
What did you say?

1986
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:28,328
Said you're talking about the same man.

1987
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:32,430
So I called him to come to this place?
For a business lunch?

1988
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:33,866
To be able to leave me?

1989
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:35,440
Dominic, I really like you.

1990
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:39,940
Right? I do not want to get you rolling.
Let's be friends.

1991
01:33:40,147 --> 01:33:42,411
Do not need more friends, Lauren.

1992
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:46,949
I do not need your friends to console me.

1993
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:50,248
Do not be stupid, Dominic.
That 'is business, not personal.

1994
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:53,917
And you know the difference?

1995
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,319
You know, Lauren, I...

1996
01:33:56,430 --> 01:34:01,265
I had not a prospectus, you know?
I made just to impress her.

1997
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:06,733
You inspired me, motivated me
to do something for me first.

1998
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:10,609
And all the time
I thought you were too good for me.

1999
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:28,257
Kris? I bought a pizza.

2000
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:42,367
I found this. Boys want convenience.
Men build homes. Fui. K

2001
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:06,028
What I do not understand is that according to the book
I was the guy with potential.

2002
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:09,327
I told her the truth, I ventured
and it was not enough.

2003
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,630
At least it was caught in an outright lie
.

2004
01:35:11,839 --> 01:35:14,103
Things are really bad with Candace now.

2005
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:17,505
Kristen did not want to see my face when I showed up at Ginny.

2006
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:19,138
It will change your mind.

2007
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:22,611
No. You do not see the way she looked at me
. With so...

2008
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:24,011
-Rage? Grief-
.

2009
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,948
It is anger. Women
get angry more easily.

2010
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:29,884
Either way, friends.
I think we caused it ourselves.

2011
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:34,027
It was in self defense. They attacked first!
We had to give change.

2012
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:36,696
Only
protect our natural right to be men.

2013
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:38,220
-That.
-Okay.

2014
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:40,059
Love us or leave us, right?

2015
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:41,659
Right!

2016
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,498
And they left us.

2017
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:45,931
Right.

2018
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:29,607
We're back.

2019
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:31,284
Take the time you need.

2020
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:32,611
Thank you.

2021
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:40,853
Zeke, take a look.

2022
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:43,759
To his right. My left.

2023
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:50,967
Not my type.

2024
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:55,575
This is how we do, Zeke.
I and you point out the attacks.

2025
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:57,774
You can bring me the bill?

2026
01:37:10,524 --> 01:37:12,287
TO SELL

2027
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:16,363
-You can only get once a year.
What kind of meat is the McRib?

2028
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:18,797
-You can only get once a year.
What kind of meat is the McRib?

2029
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:20,261
's Friends.
-Let me guess,

2030
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:21,629
photos for the album of the school?

2031
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,064
Looks like a substitute teacher.

2032
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:28,908
Finally sent my resume to Neversoft. I did my interview today.

2033
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:32,078
And they just call me.
I got the job.

2034
01:37:32,446 --> 01:37:34,505
-Really?
-Congratulations, man!

2035
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:37,776
I am a senior designer at Neversoft.
With full benefits.

2036
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:39,216
It will soon be spending their benches.

2037
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,378
I have to call Kris.

2038
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,453
She is not talking to you, is not it?

2039
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:46,316
-No.
-Connect for her anyway.

2040
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:48,761
It was because it happened.

2041
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:50,888
Yes

2042
01:37:50,998 --> 01:37:52,932
-It was good advice.
-How will your project?

2043
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:54,728
Actually, it's going very well.

2044
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:57,633
I have to go away soon and work a little
.

2045
01:37:57,738 --> 01:38:00,036
Know what we do?
We should celebrate, right?

2046
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:02,505
-Legal.
Yes-new job, Michael's first round.

2047
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,042
'Yes. Liked it.
-No. I paid the last...

2048
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,270
That's cool, just the guys.

2049
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,938
Just like old times.

2050
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:10,844
Not like the old days,
I no longer have a curfew.

2051
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:14,179
Speaking  curfew, I gotta go.
It's my night to cook.

2052
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:15,616
Bennett, is looking woman.

2053
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:18,223
We have just heard good news,
us and the guys drinking.

2054
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:21,158
He runs home the same puppy.
Come on, man!

2055
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:24,160
Do not cook because I have to, but because I want
.

2056
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:25,459
Seriously, Bennett.

2057
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,591
I'm not fucking with you, but for now...

2058
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:29,100
Do not be mad because I have a wife.

2059
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:31,694
That means that
can not spend all night with you.

2060
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:34,000
I have to get home early.

2061
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:35,900
I'm just saying.

2062
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,700
I'm buying this round.

2063
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:40,672
-I'm happy for you, congratulations.
-Thank you.

2064
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:42,178
-So long, folks. Great-B
!

2065
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:43,975
$ 20 is missing, Bennett.

2066
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:48,211
I cooked for
Gail on Thursdays. It was my day.

2067
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:50,322
I'm happy to be free. I get it.

2068
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:52,355
We're better off without them.

2069
01:38:52,559 --> 01:38:53,924
This, who needs to put up with them?

2070
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:55,823
Their demands, their boring...

2071
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:59,932
Expectations.
The expectation is the catalyst for everything.

2072
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:01,158
-Here comes.
You know what's funny?

2073
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:05,065
Gail
loved when I was cooking bolognese sauce from scratch.

2074
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:06,398
It was his favorite, so...

2075
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,667
Okay, guys, we are free to
do what we want,

2076
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:13,608
with whomever we choose,
whenever we want, right? A freedom!

2077
01:39:13,814 --> 01:39:14,838
Freedom!

2078
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:24,518
Ced, raise your glass, toast with us.

2079
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:26,716
-Right. I'm sorry. No.
-Drink it all, man.

2080
01:39:26,927 --> 01:39:28,189
A freedom.

2081
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:30,388
Turning.

2082
01:39:32,232 --> 01:39:33,529
Do not need them.

2083
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:35,929
I have to pee.

2084
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:37,228
I'll be back.

2085
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:39,702
You look like you need to do something else.

2086
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:47,041
Incoming Call Cedric

2087
01:39:47,781 --> 01:39:48,805
What is it?

2088
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:50,779
Gail, I'm not calling for a fight.

2089
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:53,044
-What the hell...
-Look! I'm coming home.

2090
01:39:53,253 --> 01:39:54,720
Even Cedric?

2091
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:57,288
Gail, I'll tell you something.
It's my house, too, Gail!

2092
01:39:57,491 --> 01:40:01,291
Pay bills in this house!
It's my house too. I'm coming.

2093
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:04,225
Where I belong, girl.

2094
01:40:04,865 --> 01:40:08,323
Gail, I'm tired of this nonsense.
I miss you, Gail.

2095
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:10,333
Gail, I no longer have been the same.

2096
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:14,234
I am here on the streets and all that shit.

2097
01:40:14,441 --> 01:40:15,806
I'm going to strip clubs.

2098
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:20,003
The girls calling me by my first name
, like I'm always there.

2099
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:22,944
And I am, but because
'm going through something, Gail.

2100
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:27,314
I have to be careful.
I need you to cuddle my back, give me love.

2101
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,011
I changed, I want my wife back!

2102
01:40:29,223 --> 01:40:31,248
I am surrounded by these guys and stuff!

2103
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:35,588
Do not want it. I no longer want this life
I want you and Jesus.

2104
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:36,788
That's it.

2105
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:38,429
Okay, Papaizao.

2106
01:40:38,632 --> 01:40:39,826
What did you say?

2107
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:41,433
What time can you get here?

2108
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:49,774
In some 20, 22, 23 minutes.

2109
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:52,275
Bring your body sexy face.
I'll be waiting.

2110
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:55,448
Do you want me to bring something?
Doritos or something?

2111
01:40:55,649 --> 01:40:58,140
Can I stop and buy dear.
All that makes you happy.

2112
01:40:58,352 --> 01:41:00,047
-Just come home.
-Okay.

2113
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:02,015
Okay, I love you.

2114
01:41:04,191 --> 01:41:05,681
Our.

2115
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:07,352
Thank you.

2116
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:11,990
That '.

2117
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:24,233
Yeah, man. Go back to Gail.

2118
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:32,742
He rubbed shit on my back?

2119
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:37,416
You wash your hands, man?

2120
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:41,489
Who shits wearing a hat?

2121
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:45,096
She said she was coming from Shanghai.

2122
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:46,860
Friends, see you later.

2123
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:49,865
Let's pay and we will too.
You are going to the Factory butts?

2124
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:52,038
Gail took me back.
I'm going home.

2125
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:54,396
Home!

2126
01:41:54,575 --> 01:41:56,600
Hey, I'm married. Please!

2127
01:41:57,044 --> 01:41:58,705
Thank you. Married man!

2128
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,847
That night,
we saw that all the plots,

2129
01:42:02,049 --> 01:42:06,281
plans and schemes
did not compare to a simple thing, the truth.

2130
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:15,117
Mommy!

2131
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:16,626
What the hell?

2132
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:18,127
Hi, dear.

2133
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:21,028
Flowers, breakfast. Ours.

2134
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:22,867
Arrived early, dear.

2135
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:26,403
I know, but I wanted to tell him to come

2136
01:42:26,607 --> 01:42:28,871
that I can not go to birthday today, Mom.

2137
01:42:29,076 --> 01:42:30,373
I have to go elsewhere.

2138
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:33,444
Well, it's the 75th anniversary of the church.

2139
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:36,276
What is it, dear? Where have to go?

2140
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:39,077
See Candace.
At the meeting of her family, mother.

2141
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:46,718
Good for you.

2142
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:49,985
Okay, honey.

2143
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:51,164
-Really?
-Okay.

2144
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:53,492
I'll see you tomorrow, right?
It's time you go.

2145
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:56,635
Loretta,
is my turn to have to spank.

2146
01:42:57,437 --> 01:42:58,734
Deacon Johnson?

2147
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:00,907
, It has the keys?
-Put it down, you idiot!

2148
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:02,575
How long does this happen?

2149
01:43:02,776 --> 01:43:03,902
Ninety days.

2150
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:06,807
Well, now they are 91.
Sorry to have stretched his shirt.

2151
01:43:06,914 --> 01:43:08,176
How you doing, Michael?

2152
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:11,647
-Okay, idiot, go now.
-You know, these pills cost $ 19.

2153
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:13,183
Mom, you used my chuck it?

2154
01:43:13,387 --> 01:43:15,014
dear. You can go.

2155
01:43:15,222 --> 01:43:16,951
Listen, you idiot!

2156
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:20,684
I said that would take the coffee up there, you old fool
.

2157
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:24,321
Look who I found.

2158
01:43:25,132 --> 01:43:27,327
Okay, the third time I hope it luck.

2159
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:28,526
Actually, I think it gives.

2160
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:30,364
-Go, tell.
-We want to make an offer.

2161
01:43:31,838 --> 01:43:34,102
-I told you this would happen.
-Actually did not speak.

2162
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:38,033
What good news.
We had a good feeling about you.

2163
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:39,470
Kris?

2164
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:40,842
Jeremy, what are you doing here?

2165
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:42,106
I need to talk with you.

2166
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:44,207
I can not. I'm in the middle of something.

2167
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:45,844
Is important.

2168
01:43:46,687 --> 01:43:48,450
No problems. Take your time.

2169
01:43:48,655 --> 01:43:50,680
I'll get the papers and we can start.

2170
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:52,153
I'm sorry.

2171
01:43:54,161 --> 01:43:55,423
Someone died?

2172
01:43:55,529 --> 01:43:56,518
What? No

2173
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:58,388
Well, you're in a suit, I thought...

2174
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:01,067
-I got the job at Neversoft.
-Really?

2175
01:44:01,268 --> 01:44:02,360
Yes

2176
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:05,332
I mean, good.
I hope I have done that for me.

2177
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,637
I did. At the beginning.

2178
01:44:09,142 --> 01:44:12,737
But somehow, throughout the pretense
,

2179
01:44:13,647 --> 01:44:15,740
I knew that I wanted it for me.

2180
01:44:16,783 --> 01:44:19,616
And now that I have, I want for us.

2181
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,520
You were the first to whom I wanted to call
count,

2182
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:25,920
and not being able to drove me crazy.

2183
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:29,792
You're the last person whom I think
before going to sleep, Kris.

2184
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:30,997
Look

2185
01:44:32,065 --> 01:44:33,054
miss.

2186
01:44:33,233 --> 01:44:34,632
Oh, dear.

2187
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:37,599
I miss you and want you back.

2188
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:39,433
So beautiful.

2189
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,137
I want to buy a house.

2190
01:44:41,341 --> 01:44:42,603
This is my guy in charge.

2191
01:44:42,809 --> 01:44:44,174
I want to buy this house for you.

2192
01:44:44,378 --> 01:44:46,437
You can stop, idiot.
Not going to buy my house.

2193
01:44:46,647 --> 01:44:47,636
Okay.

2194
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:49,179
Who is he to buy my house?

2195
01:44:49,316 --> 01:44:50,340
Breathe .

2196
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:52,941
I'm breathing. I'm fine.

2197
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:56,182
Right.

2198
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:12,034
I want to be his wife.
I want you to be my husband...

2199
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:18,472
I want to be her husband.

2200
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:21,414
And I want you to be my wife,

2201
01:45:21,748 --> 01:45:23,272
very much.

2202
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:25,115
So...

2203
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:37,457
Will you marry me?

2204
01:45:41,568 --> 01:45:42,557
I agree.

2205
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:45,605
-She did.
-That there, man.

2206
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:48,104
-She got it changed the game.
-She what?

2207
01:45:48,308 --> 01:45:49,400
Do not worry about it.

2208
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:00,820
Zeke was singing a new tune.

2209
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:03,251
The last was
Bitch Betta Have My Money AMG's.

2210
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:05,018
I'm not in order to stay away from home today.

2211
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:10,028
Let. You know the best way to forget a guy
is find another.

2212
01:46:10,297 --> 01:46:12,356
-You will.
-... Show him some love.

2213
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:13,932
Zeke, go here.

2214
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:16,458
Hey, thank you.

2215
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:17,592
Oh my God.

2216
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:19,103
I do not play this song for years...

2217
01:46:19,306 --> 01:46:20,432
It is the...

2218
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:24,271
... But it was inspired in a special woman

2219
01:46:26,012 --> 01:46:27,707
by whom is worth the wait.

2220
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:34,150
Last night I had a dream about a dream

2221
01:46:34,254 --> 01:46:37,087
About Me

2222
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:42,522
-I gotta get away.
-Mya!

2223
01:46:43,463 --> 01:46:44,760
Mya!

2224
01:46:47,267 --> 01:46:50,065
Mya, you can expect? Mya?

2225
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:53,637
Do you think
going to sing a song and all will be forgotten?

2226
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,831
Do not! Just thought it could be a start.

2227
01:46:56,276 --> 01:46:58,836
You know what?
You can not change the nature of a person.

2228
01:46:59,045 --> 01:47:00,672
That is not true.
I know that is not true.

2229
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:02,180
-How?
-Because I want to start over.

2230
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:05,141
I want another 90 days.

2231
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:07,845
No sex?

2232
01:47:08,054 --> 01:47:09,919
If you need to.

2233
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,384
I do not want sex, Mya. I want you.

2234
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:14,193
That's bullshit.

2235
01:47:16,296 --> 01:47:18,355
Sure, it's bullshit. Yes!
Course I want sex.

2236
01:47:18,565 --> 01:47:21,898
But sex was all I wanted
before you know it. Now,

2237
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:23,661
want you.

2238
01:47:24,704 --> 01:47:25,671
Right?

2239
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,673
Now? I want coffee.

2240
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:33,738
I want to stay up all night talking about his childhood
mad. I want to...

2241
01:47:35,315 --> 01:47:39,342
I do not know.
I want to talk about the Myth of the Cave of Aristotle.

2242
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:44,613
It is in Plato.

2243
01:47:44,825 --> 01:47:46,190
Plato also had caves?

2244
01:47:46,927 --> 01:47:48,121
Yes

2245
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:50,062
Mya, I love you.

2246
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:54,623
I'm in love with you.

2247
01:47:56,937 --> 01:47:59,565
Never told anyone in my life.

2248
01:48:02,843 --> 01:48:04,936
Why not say so?

2249
01:48:19,426 --> 01:48:21,917
It turns out that my epiphany had a domino effect.

2250
01:48:22,362 --> 01:48:26,458
All were committed to their wives. Really.

2251
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:29,163
I did not catch anything.

2252
01:48:30,537 --> 01:48:33,631
Candace?
His mother told me that you're still single.

2253
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,308
Do not worry,
I think I have a solution.

2254
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:40,241
I have someone in my office that
will be ideal for you. Her name is Amy.

2255
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:42,677
It? She does not play the other team.

2256
01:48:42,883 --> 01:48:44,248
She might want to try.

2257
01:48:44,451 --> 01:48:45,748
Mother!

2258
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,749
Thank you, Duke. You can leave me.

2259
01:48:49,656 --> 01:48:51,521
-Hi, girls.
-Look at that face!

2260
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:54,251
Good to see you all.

2261
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,954
What are you doing here?
I had to go to church?

2262
01:48:57,163 --> 01:48:58,289
It had.

2263
01:48:58,498 --> 01:48:59,658
And then? It was canceled?

2264
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,027
No. Why all these questions, woman?

2265
01:49:02,235 --> 01:49:04,100
I just thought you needed to be there.

2266
01:49:04,304 --> 01:49:07,432
Why would I be there when he needed to be here
,

2267
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:09,370
number one with the woman of my life?

2268
01:49:09,576 --> 01:49:11,009
While you're thinking so much,

2269
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:12,974
Why do not you think
get me a hamburger in

2270
01:49:13,079 --> 01:49:14,103
with pickles and mustard?

2271
01:49:14,514 --> 01:49:15,845
Sorry,

2272
01:49:17,651 --> 01:49:20,518
you say'' number one''?

2273
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:23,389
So do not believe?
Wait a minute.

2274
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:25,888
Ladies and gentlemen. Excuse me.

2275
01:49:26,092 --> 01:49:29,687
I need attention.
Hey, guys... That '.

2276
01:49:29,896 --> 01:49:31,022
Thank you.

2277
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:34,962
My name is Michael Hanover
and want everyone to know

2278
01:49:35,168 --> 01:49:40,037
I am madly in love by Candace Hall.

2279
01:49:41,942 --> 01:49:44,911
And I want everyone in the world to know

2280
01:49:45,278 --> 01:49:47,803
it is the number one woman in my life.

2281
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:50,079
Thanks, guys.

2282
01:49:50,283 --> 01:49:51,978
Now back to the meeting!

2283
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,657
It was enough for you?

2284
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:05,163
What do you want on your burger?

2285
01:50:05,799 --> 01:50:08,700
Do not give a damn girl.
I came for you. Come here.

2286
01:50:15,575 --> 01:50:18,203
And then ,
the book had a happy ending for all of us.

2287
01:50:18,712 --> 01:50:21,237
Well, almost all of us.

2288
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:23,279
Hey, girl. I have not seen in a while.

2289
01:50:23,483 --> 01:50:26,043
I know. Sorry. I've been busy.

2290
01:50:26,186 --> 01:50:27,153
What do later today?

2291
01:50:27,387 --> 01:50:30,356
Actually,
I have a meeting with James.

2292
01:50:30,557 --> 01:50:34,618
He is executive director and I
operations, there is not much time for us.

2293
01:50:34,728 --> 01:50:35,786
And what else is new?

2294
01:50:35,895 --> 01:50:37,829
Anyway, you have plans for later?

2295
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:41,094
Actually,
three of us go to the opening of Dominic's restaurant.

2296
01:50:44,337 --> 01:50:46,567
He found an investor for the restaurant?

2297
01:50:46,773 --> 01:50:49,298
She arranged a loan for a mobile restaurant called...

2298
01:50:49,509 --> 01:50:50,703
Avenue D.

2299
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:54,209
It is located in Pueblo Plaza.
He ??wants to start small and increase gradually.

2300
01:50:54,414 --> 01:50:56,143
Good for him.

2301
01:50:57,684 --> 01:50:58,981
Anyway, have fun tonight.

2302
01:50:59,185 --> 01:51:00,413
We will .

2303
01:51:03,623 --> 01:51:04,749
Thank you.

2304
01:51:05,258 --> 01:51:06,623
James, how was your day?

2305
01:51:06,826 --> 01:51:09,351
It was good. In fact, it was great.

2306
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:12,056
I told the The Wall Street Journal
did a story about me?

2307
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:14,963
Yes, the...
-'' Whiz kid''. Yeah, I know.

2308
01:51:15,168 --> 01:51:16,226
'' The Boy Wonder.''

2309
01:51:16,436 --> 01:51:17,869
I know I am no longer a boy,

2310
01:51:17,971 --> 01:51:20,565
but I'm the youngest CEO of a
Fortune 500 company.

2311
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:21,832
Yeah, we talked...

2312
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:23,909
Now I'm focusing on the Far East.

2313
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:26,604
Other day I talked to Warren.
Meet Warren Buffett?

2314
01:51:26,813 --> 01:51:28,007
Dub-Beezy, my friend.

2315
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:30,813
He was talking about diversification.

2316
01:51:32,285 --> 01:51:37,018
So I bought a G6.
One, the company bought a G6.

2317
01:51:37,223 --> 01:51:38,884
From New York to LA
costs about $ 60,000.

2318
01:51:38,992 --> 01:51:40,254
They spend it whenever I go.

2319
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:41,859
I also talked to my friend, Kobe.

2320
01:51:41,961 --> 01:51:43,929
He wanted
I bought an NBA franchise.

2321
01:51:44,397 --> 01:51:46,592
I'm fine, James.

2322
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:49,362
Thank you for asking.

2323
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:53,461
Sorry, did not understand.

2324
01:51:53,673 --> 01:51:55,106
I know.

2325
01:51:57,210 --> 01:52:00,145
I know, but I finally understand.

2326
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:11,489
Right.

2327
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:15,819
Okay, a little bit.

2328
01:52:15,929 --> 01:52:18,124
Only one sample for the girls.
Friends, now bring more.

2329
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:19,357
Come on, Don!

2330
01:52:19,466 --> 01:52:22,094
Give it to his wife.
To his girl, right, that's it.

2331
01:52:22,435 --> 01:52:24,926
Okay, one more?
Here, J.

2332
01:52:25,038 --> 01:52:26,369
I'll be back. Thanks for coming.

2333
01:52:26,473 --> 01:52:27,667
-I'll be back.
-That is too much.

2334
01:52:30,243 --> 01:52:31,437
Next!

2335
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:33,538
I want the chef's special.

2336
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:35,044
Chicken or...

2337
01:52:35,248 --> 01:52:38,081
Hey, go to the end of the queue.
-Look, this is personal, not business.

2338
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:39,717
Take your arm!

2339
01:52:41,454 --> 01:52:42,682
Congratulations.

2340
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:44,151
It seems to be a great success.

2341
01:52:45,258 --> 01:52:47,089
Not been waiting for you.

2342
01:52:47,293 --> 01:52:48,988
I could not lose its grand opening.

2343
01:52:49,395 --> 01:52:50,487
Ceviche fish?

2344
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:52,325
Sal, the two lasagnas are for travel.

2345
01:52:52,866 --> 01:52:54,094
You can leave.

2346
01:52:55,268 --> 01:52:56,428
Where is your CEO?

2347
01:52:57,103 --> 01:52:58,365
I finished everything.

2348
01:52:58,805 --> 01:52:59,965
Dominic!

2349
01:53:00,106 --> 01:53:03,564
He ??can have all the money and power in the world

2350
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:05,768
, but has half its potential.
-Stop!

2351
01:53:05,979 --> 01:53:07,412
Stop.

2352
01:53:07,914 --> 01:53:10,542
Do not need to do it again for me.
I am in charge.

2353
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:11,910
Right?

2354
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,985
Thank you for coming,
but I have a business to touch.

2355
01:53:15,088 --> 01:53:17,056
I'm sure I can respect that.

2356
01:53:18,258 --> 01:53:19,953
-But I would...
-Next!

2357
01:53:25,398 --> 01:53:27,889
What's good here, man?
Has the pork less greasy?

2358
01:53:28,434 --> 01:53:29,924
Sure.
-I want it.

2359
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:32,465
Dominic?

2360
01:53:33,506 --> 01:53:35,474
Excuse. What are you doing?

2361
01:53:35,775 --> 01:53:37,470
I want you back, Dominic.

2362
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:43,309
-Staff, just a minute. I know.
-We have to cook it.

2363
01:53:43,516 --> 01:53:44,881
I'm sorry.

2364
01:53:46,853 --> 01:53:48,946
-What are you doing?
-I want you back.

2365
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:51,749
Look, I'm not an acquisition.
You can not decide...

2366
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:54,552
-I am asking.
-Really? And I'm asking for service.

2367
01:53:54,761 --> 01:53:57,457
You'll have your pork sausage,
fat man! Shut up!

2368
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:04,095
Lauren, are very different, right?

2369
01:54:04,304 --> 01:54:07,762
Yes, we are different.
But I think that's good.

2370
01:54:07,974 --> 01:54:10,408
What you need is status.
Need titles.

2371
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,535
-I do not care...
No, I do not care.

2372
01:54:12,645 --> 01:54:16,809
Need
is a man who makes me feel special.

2373
01:54:17,116 --> 01:54:18,913
Do not care for the title,

2374
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:20,747
and do not care how much you earn

2375
01:54:20,954 --> 01:54:24,082
car drives.
I just need you.

2376
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:26,918
Please? I'm sorry.

2377
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:32,791
I think ultimately we want different things.

2378
01:54:32,999 --> 01:54:34,159
No.

2379
01:54:34,968 --> 01:54:36,265
I disagree.

2380
01:54:38,304 --> 01:54:40,966
I think I want the same thing.

2381
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:43,808
What is it?

2382
01:54:44,911 --> 01:54:46,208
Well, first,

2383
01:54:47,647 --> 01:54:50,445
want my chef's special, not the pig.

2384
01:55:09,769 --> 01:55:12,329
Don! Okay, man, no more kissing.

2385
01:55:12,438 --> 01:55:13,564
Grab her ass and such.

2386
01:55:13,673 --> 01:55:14,662
That's my girl!

2387
01:55:14,774 --> 01:55:17,402
Show me something!
Something for me to think tonight.

2388
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:18,908
Know that I am not having much sex.

2389
01:55:19,012 --> 01:55:20,536
Gail and I are not so active.

2390
01:55:20,747 --> 01:55:22,044
Even Cedric?

2391
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:25,081
Come on.
-Bring your butt here now!

2392
01:55:25,285 --> 01:55:26,479
Hey Gail, I was talking about...

2393
01:55:26,686 --> 01:55:28,813
Lift your pants, Cedric!

2394
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,223
I'm with the guy in purple.

2395
01:55:36,429 --> 01:55:38,329
-Hi, I'm Bennett.
-We use our ball?

2396
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:43,563
Let's see on the court! Save for the game!

2397
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:45,601
Listen, little one. Where is your twin?

2398
01:55:45,705 --> 01:55:46,933
You will need someone to climb.

2399
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,667
That's funny. Very funny.

2400
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:50,402
Ria when my balls are on your back!

OF STEVE HARVEY

2403
01:55:53,112 --> 01:55:54,101
-The ball is in play.
-Oh, shit.

2404
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:02,385
Pass the ball, man!

2405
01:56:11,564 --> 01:56:12,861
It will make the defense?

2406
01:56:14,167 --> 01:56:15,464
Wait, wait!

2407
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:17,127
Pass!

2408
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,464
Just throw the ball.

2409
01:56:24,243 --> 01:56:26,541
It is better to get out of here, little one.
Are you okay?

2410
01:56:27,313 --> 01:56:29,110
Hey, no jokes.

2411
01:56:33,453 --> 01:56:34,647
Good pitch.

2412
01:56:34,954 --> 01:56:36,717
Good-pitch?
-It was the same!

2413
01:56:36,923 --> 01:56:39,483
-Bennett is a man and push it!
-It was a good pitch.

2414
01:56:54,273 --> 01:56:55,570
Stir with someone your own size.

2415
01:56:57,777 --> 01:56:59,039
Oh, my knee!

2416
01:57:08,621 --> 01:57:10,111
Dude, you have to calm down.

2417
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:12,188
He put his balls in my head.

2418
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:19,297
Where is my help in the defense?

2419
01:57:23,169 --> 01:57:24,261
Get out of here!

2420
01:57:26,506 --> 01:57:27,666
Bennett! Jeremy!

2421
01:57:27,807 --> 01:57:30,537
I'm trying to get my ball back!
Can you give me the ball?

2422
01:57:30,643 --> 01:57:32,508
Let them. Let them.

2423
01:57:33,746 --> 01:57:35,304
Thank you, guys! -
Go grab.

2424
01:57:35,515 --> 01:57:37,483
Hey, we play here every Thursday.

2425
01:57:37,683 --> 01:57:39,310
It was not so bad.

2426
01:57:39,519 --> 01:57:40,850
Think about it.

2427
01:57:41,854 --> 01:57:45,551
Well, that was fun.
It was a good year, folks.
