1
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:36,668
<i>Summon the power of Five
and save the world, Go-Rangers!</i>

2
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:39,471
To be continued.

3
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:05,217
Hi, there.

4
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:07,719
What?

5
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,456
Why are you open?

6
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,426
It's business hours.

7
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:17,829
Nobody will shop today!

8
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:26,238
I see what you mean!

9
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:27,839
It beats Billy Joel.

10
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,375
I used to think punk rock was
stupid.

11
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:31,810
You like it?

12
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:36,582
They're mocking Sinatra
with their version of "My Way."

13
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:40,252
Now you should listen to this.

14
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,857
Gyaku-rin?

15
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,259
Gekirin. Wrath.

16
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:48,393
A punk band?

17
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:52,331
Yes, they're Japanese.
A year before the Pistols.

18
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:55,000
It was 37 years ago...

19
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,540
Nobody in Japan knew what punk was.
It didn't sell.

20
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,076
No more pressings or CDs were made.

21
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,379
Fish Story.

22
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,852
The Beatles had broken up and
The Velvet Underground had gone weird.

23
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,821
Rock's future was uncertain...

24
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,322
You do know, right?

25
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,694
You are aware that the comet
is on its way.

26
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,031
Who's he?

27
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,199
I don't know.

28
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,981
Hey, watch it!

29
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:49,121
<i>The impact of the comet crash
will trigger a tidal wave.</i>

30
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:51,757
<i>Evacuate to elevated places.</i>

31
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,592
<i>I repeat.</i>

32
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,563
<i>A tidal wave is expected.
Evacuate to elevated places.</i>

33
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:04,303
<i>A 100-meter tidal wave is expected
along the coast.</i>

34
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,738
<i>Immediate action advised.</i>

35
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:13,445
They won't make it, but everyone
is headed for Mt. Fuji anyway.

36
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:17,115
5 hours from now, the world will end.

37
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:19,651
2012.

38
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,290
5 hours to the comet crash.

39
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,331
You never know.

40
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:35,534
The comet's orbit might alter.

41
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,936
It's 100% certain.

42
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:41,606
Not 99%. You can see it right there.

43
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,776
Another comet might crash
into it and...

44
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:47,746
And where is this second comet?

45
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:52,951
OK, let's assume that the comet
collides with Earth.

46
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,354
It's not an assumption! It will!

47
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:58,123
It may hit the other side of Earth.

48
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:02,594
Great. Let's say that it hits
somewhere off Argentina.

49
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:06,998
But the comet is huge,
at 5 kilometers in diameter

50
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,835
the ensuing tidal wave
will engulf Japan!

51
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,704
It'll be twice as tall as Godzilla.

52
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,778
Even if you ran to the mountains,
you'd die in the volcanic eruptions.

53
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:25,117
You might survive in the shelters, but
then there will be an Ice Age.

54
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,320
This is the end.

55
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,957
The end is here, no surprises.

56
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:39,264
But the Americans put nuclear bombs
on the comet six months ago.

57
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,803
Ah, Operation Armageddon?

58
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:48,740
Their vehicle blew up before
the bombs were detonated.

59
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,311
The bombs are still there.
They could get activated...

60
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,713
How?

61
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,282
By something...

62
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,784
Something?

63
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,520
A... freak accident!

64
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,188
The heroes...

65
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,760
Champions of justice will
save humanity.

66
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:14,866
Huh?

67
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:19,471
Maybe Bruce Willis
is still on the comet.

68
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:20,872
They come in Five.

69
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,274
Five heroes!

70
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:25,010
Like Go-Rangers.

71
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,745
Right, Go-Rangers.

72
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:32,684
They are spread out over the world.
Now they know their mission.

73
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:33,652
I see.

74
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:37,522
All five of them didn't know
their mission before now.

75
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:41,493
The five heroes will prevent
the catastrophe.

76
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:46,064
By operating a robot,
they'll push the comet back.

77
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:50,302
It's Gundam. That's right,
I remember that.

78
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,038
Oh, are there five Gundams?

79
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,074
No.

80
00:07:56,174 --> 00:08:01,012
There are no Gundams and
no Go-Rangers either.

81
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:09,254
If you have any other bright ideas,
please share them.

82
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:15,660
This is the end.
There's no chance of survival.

83
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,864
There is no hope.

84
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,001
For 10 years, I've known that
this would happen.

85
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:26,404
A Prince with wavy golden
hair will come...

86
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:39,384
Is this really punk music?

87
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:40,685
It is. It's punk.

88
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,630
<i>The story of my solitude</i>

89
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:55,600
<i>If my solitude were a fish</i>

90
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:59,237
How can solitude be a fish?

91
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,140
This song will save the day.

92
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,979
Music saves the world.

93
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:38,143
<i>The story of my solitude
If my solitude were a fish</i>

94
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,947
<i>It'd be so enormous, so militant</i>

95
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,382
<i>A whale would get out of there</i>

96
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:50,021
<i>Don't assume that I'm dead
Don't assume that I'm dead</i>

97
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:55,293
<i>Music stacked up like wooden blocks
is the only salvation</i>

98
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,131
<i>The story of my failure
If my failure were a fish</i>

99
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:06,071
<i>It'd be so tragically comic
I'd have no place in the sea to be</i>

100
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:08,873
1975.

101
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:12,911
A year before the pioneering
punk rock band,

102
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:17,482
Sex Pistols was formed.

103
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,660
Gyaku-rin?

104
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:30,228
It's Gekirin.

105
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:32,097
"Fish Story by Gekirin"

106
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,267
They broke up about 7 years ago.

107
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:39,537
Nobody noticed because
nobody knew about them.

108
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:43,475
Fish Story?
I've never heard of it.

109
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,748
Anything else?

110
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,419
Here's Kaguya-hime.

111
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:58,923
When it's played backwards, you hear
"I want to listen too."

112
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,826
I heard that one the other day.

113
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:07,332
What's this?

114
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:08,466
"Kaleidoscope"

115
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,770
Not that one. That one puts
a curse on you.

116
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:19,577
There's some moaning in the last
chorus, but it isn't a band member.

117
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,713
Excellent!

118
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:26,051
The voice gets louder
as you listen to it.

119
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,530
1982.

120
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,635
30 years to the comet crash.

121
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,074
Holy shit!

122
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,411
Got any other scary tapes?

123
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:56,748
You've got to hear this one.

124
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,483
The Gyaku-rin.

125
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:01,052
You can hear it if you're lucky.

126
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:02,454
What do you mean?

127
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:04,923
That's what I read in
Mu magazine.

128
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,257
The occult mag!

129
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:09,894
You can hear a woman's scream
in the silence.

130
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:10,695
Silence?

131
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:17,135
Right after the guitar solo begins
the sound becomes muted.

132
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:20,705
After a minute of total silence,
the song resumes.

133
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:25,310
On the record cover it says,
"There's a silent part."

134
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,714
"The silence is intended.
It isn't an error."

135
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:30,815
Guys...

136
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:31,883
What?

137
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:37,922
Why do you think they put in
that silent part?

138
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:39,958
To be different.

139
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,794
It would be cool if it
was The Beatles...

140
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:48,233
It wasn't to be cool, apparently
there was a scream in the recording.

141
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:54,072
The record company didn't like it
and had it erased.

142
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,741
Why else would they mute part
of a song?

143
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:02,180
It was muted, but some people with
sixth sense can still hear it.

144
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:08,820
Now it's a legendary song among
paranormal record collectors.

145
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,967
Get your hands off!

146
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,169
Ouch...

147
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,475
<i>The story of my failure
If my failure were a fish</i>

148
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:33,111
How can failure be a fish?

149
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:35,213
There are many rumors.

150
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,883
"The vocalist lost it."
"It's the bassist's curse."

151
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:42,921
"A groupie with a knife stormed
the studio."

152
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:49,594
If I heard the scream, would my
car get cursed?

153
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,997
If you heard the scream...

154
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,266
What then?

155
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:57,936
What would happen?

156
00:13:58,036 --> 00:13:59,804
Hey, it's a red light!

157
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,246
What would happen if I heard it?

158
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:09,080
Shut up!

159
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:46,651
Don't open it!

160
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,393
I didn't hear anything.

161
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:58,730
Told you.
Only people with sixth sense hear it.

162
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:07,038
Thank you very much for coming to
meet us today.

163
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:08,539
Cheers!

164
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:15,880
You're all pretty.

165
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,816
I know the co-manager here.

166
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:24,789
I didn't expect girls as pretty
as you to show up.

167
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:29,427
Drink up, Haruko.
Your name's Haruko, right?

168
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,362
By the way...

169
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:33,064
Who's he?

170
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:37,535
He's just the driver.

171
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,905
Oh, so that's your car.

172
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:43,508
Right...

173
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:46,911
No, the car's mine.
He's just driving it.

174
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,846
Pretend he's not here.

175
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:55,186
I didn't think I'd have a chance with
an elite university girl like you.

176
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,323
A cursed tape?

177
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,192
We were listening to some.

178
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,995
Hey, don't bring that up now!

179
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,965
Sorry, girls.
He reads Mu magazine.

180
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:10,134
Haruko is into that kind
of thing too.

181
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:16,874
Do you believe in
Nostradamus' prophecies?

182
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,776
Hey, cut it out.

183
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:22,880
"In the year 1999 and seven months,
the world ends."

184
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,083
Of course, it won't.

185
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:28,486
You never know.
Anything can happen.

186
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:37,428
Ever since Haruko was a child...
How can I put it?

187
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,231
It's like she's got sixth sense.

188
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:44,969
You see ghosts?
I've heard of people like that.

189
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,507
Tell us one of your predictions.
She's always right.

190
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:53,378
Skeptics always just end up making
fun of me.

191
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:57,248
Not me, I believe in
that kind of stuff.

192
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:58,616
Same here.

193
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:12,797
I met a man today...

194
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:21,839
who will end up saving the world.

195
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:29,747
He'll play an important role
in saving humanity.

196
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:35,019
Like stopping the Nostradamus
catastrophes?

197
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:09,454
Tonight you'll meet a woman
you are fated to meet.

198
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,139
You are here.

199
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:34,545
He said to pretend that
you aren't here. But you are.

200
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:36,881
I guess so.

201
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:39,016
Can you live with that?

202
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:40,952
Live with what?

203
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:43,287
With the way you're treated.

204
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:48,226
Well it's just that he's notorious
for his violent fits.

205
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,029
Have you ever stood up for yourself?

206
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:57,768
If you don't, somebody will take
the woman you're fated to meet.

207
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,372
Remember that.

208
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:09,347
What will we do?

209
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:13,718
I don't know if everybody's coming
to the next place.

210
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:16,254
Oh, I'm drunk.

211
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,991
Why don't we go there first and
wait for them?

212
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:21,259
OK.

213
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:28,666
Excuse me.

214
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,270
Would you like a ride?

215
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:34,472
Okay.

216
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:03,734
Do you think...

217
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,206
What do you want?

218
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:11,075
Don't smoke...

219
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:18,149
Please don't smoke.

220
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:34,999
Go left.

221
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,234
Left?

222
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:40,171
Next on the right.

223
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:41,439
To the right...

224
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,579
Here we are.

225
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:55,953
A Love Inn...?

226
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,257
The bar's near here.

227
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,526
It's around the corner.

228
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,631
They're waiting.

229
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,232
But, but...

230
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,634
Come on, Haruko.

231
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:13,437
The night's not over yet.
Come on.

232
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:14,405
Wait a minute.

233
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:16,340
Haruko, what are you waiting for?

234
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,543
It's right over there,
so come on.

235
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,012
Come on.

236
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:24,448
It's really right
around the corner, Haruko.

237
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,550
Come on, hurry now.

238
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:40,364
Wait... Hello?

239
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:44,335
I mean... Hey!

240
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,181
You can go home now.

241
00:21:57,415 --> 00:21:58,449
But...

242
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,520
Scram!

243
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:05,923
Get out of here!

244
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:24,942
<i>Have you ever stood up for yourself?</i>

245
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:32,016
Hey!

246
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,832
Stand up to the bastard!

247
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:51,502
Why am I doing what he
told me to do?

248
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,308
What kind of wimp am I?

249
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:02,279
<i>Don't smoke.
I'm a Goddamn idiot!</i>

250
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,522
<i>The story of my failure
If my failure were a fish</i>

251
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:17,395
<i>It'd be so tragically comic
I'd have no place in the sea to be</i>

252
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:22,800
<i>Don't you know you're a liar!
Don't you know you're a deceiver!</i>

253
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:28,205
<i>Music stacked up like wooden blocks
Is the champion of justice!</i>

254
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:47,625
<i>If my justice really were a fish</i>

255
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:50,327
<i>It'd be so greedy and arrogant</i>

256
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:54,365
<i>I'd pump the magma
Out of the ocean bed!</i>

257
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:11,715
<i>You can hear a woman's scream.</i>

258
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:36,453
Help me!

259
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:44,528
What do you want?

260
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,232
Go away!

261
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,339
Let go!

262
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,614
Let me go! Help!

263
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:02,806
Why did the sound cut out there?

264
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:06,009
It's deliberate.

265
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,346
It goes out for one minute
during the solo.

266
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:12,349
It has a meaning.

267
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:15,419
Guess what it is.

268
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:19,623
Heroes who save Earth...
Music that saves humanity.

269
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,659
Why can't we have a
sensible conversation?

270
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,131
You know what I'd do if the world
really ended today?

271
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,367
I'd listen to my favorite music.

272
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:33,170
Have you ever eaten bird's nests?

273
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:40,043
I have. It's one of the most
expensive Chinese delicacies.

274
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:42,579
Ever had a threesome?

275
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:44,281
What's this about?

276
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:48,152
I have, and one of the women
was a blonde.

277
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:50,287
Yeah, big deal.

278
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:55,926
I've done it all.
There's nothing I haven't done.

279
00:29:56,126 --> 00:30:00,964
I did it while you were listening
to stupid music.

280
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:04,468
I've done everything
my heart desired.

281
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:09,206
I've tasted exotic cuisines around
the world.

282
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:14,945
I owned a Countach, had a cruise
around the world and threesomes.

283
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,883
All on borrowed money.
Now I won't have to pay it back.

284
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,420
There's nothing more I want.

285
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:29,960
Stomach cancer has spread through
my body, eating up my bones.

286
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:32,462
It's terminal.

287
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:38,101
I could have had it removed
and fully recovered.

288
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:42,506
But I didn't.
You want to know why?

289
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:47,277
Because I knew that this day
would come.

290
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:49,413
I've known it for 10 years.

291
00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:54,384
<i>The story of my solitude
If my solitude were a fish</i>

292
00:30:54,918 --> 00:31:00,190
<i>It'd be so enormous, so militant,
A whale would get out of there</i>

293
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,395
<i>Don't assume that I'm dead
Your eyes are wide shut</i>

294
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:34,091
"The man who'd save the world."
Remember that?

295
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,995
Yeah, that was back when we were
at college.

296
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:41,632
I wanted to talk more with
that girl.

297
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:42,900
Me too.

298
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,234
You slept with her?

299
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,904
I don't remember what happened.

300
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:53,977
But I remember her prediction
about a man who'd save the world.

301
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:58,715
That's why I quit my job
and came to this place.

302
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,519
The 7th month of 1999.

303
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:07,925
The Great King of Terror will come.
- Nostradamus.

304
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:12,195
I miss my son.

305
00:32:13,363 --> 00:32:16,266
Come on, you're the one
who asked for the divorce.

306
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,003
Stay with me and you'll be fine.

307
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:23,607
We're the chosen ones.

308
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:27,344
"Even if the world would end tomorrow,"

309
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:30,547
"I would continue to plant my apple trees."

310
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:34,284
These are my favorite words.

311
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:39,089
Let's believe in our survival.

312
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:45,228
We shall create a new world
and be the messiahs

313
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:48,231
of our new world.

314
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:51,435
Like Noah's Ark, sir?

315
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:54,037
Just like Noah's Ark.

316
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,876
It'll be tomorrow.

317
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,380
Are you sure?

318
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,583
It's got to be tomorrow.

319
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,254
I gave up everything for this.
My job, women, everything.

320
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:15,392
Even if the world
would end tomorrow...

321
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,195
Everybody, behold.

322
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:22,933
The last sunset of the world.

323
00:33:31,942 --> 00:33:34,411
Nothing happened!

324
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:40,317
The last sunset? The sun's here
and it's hot! 35 degrees!

325
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:47,157
You said today was the last so I
quit my job to join you!

326
00:33:56,533 --> 00:34:00,771
Everybody listen. It's just like
we've been telling you.

327
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:04,141
Nothing will happen in 1999.

328
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:10,514
We figured out that the
prophecy was off by 10 years.

329
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:17,821
In reality, the Great King of Terror
won't come until 2009.

330
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:21,124
We will prepare the Ark
for that occasion.

331
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:23,994
A Prince with wavy golden hair...

332
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:27,464
That being a metaphor for a comet.

333
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:31,334
My reading of the prophecy
is that it will come in 2012...

334
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:33,270
No, it's 2009!

335
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,405
In the year 2012...

336
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:37,274
2009!

337
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:38,642
2012...

338
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:43,280
My friends, don't be
deceived by this man.

339
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,348
He's a fake prophet.

340
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,417
So are you!

341
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:53,890
I won't associate with his kind!
That man is a phony!

342
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:57,627
I'm the prophet!

343
00:34:58,028 --> 00:35:01,264
I'm not like him!

344
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:04,701
The man who'll save the world...

345
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:12,209
Friends! Don't give up hope!

346
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:16,313
The end will certainly come.
It will come soon!

347
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,817
It'll all end!
But don't give up hope!

348
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:23,987
The world will end!

349
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,924
Where's Noah's Ark?
You don't even have a boat!

350
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,281
I'll take your photo.

351
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,151
Here I go.

352
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,486
That's great!

353
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:31,154
Passengers, we'd like to thank you
for using our services today.

354
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:38,495
This ferry continues its voyage
to Hokkaido after leaving Tokyo...

355
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,808
Sir, please!

356
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,811
We can't turn around
just for you.

357
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:59,349
Didn't you hear the announcement?
It's so loud!

358
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,087
I didn't hear it. When I sleep,
I can't hear a thing.

359
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:06,022
That's too bad.

360
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:21,705
Stop! What are you doing?

361
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:24,140
Let me go! Let me die!

362
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:28,945
Why...

363
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:32,148
Why Hokkaido?

364
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,818
"Destination - Hokkaido"

365
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:42,225
A herd of dolphins have been
sighted on the port side.

366
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:48,565
For a view of the dolphins, please look
to the left side of the ship.

367
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:05,415
That's a Yamana High School
uniform you're wearing, right?

368
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,518
It's famous for its smart students.

369
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:12,188
Many go on to good universities.

370
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:18,328
... But I failed to get off the boat.

371
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,749
Uh, what's this...?

372
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:43,019
It's a fruit tart.

373
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:49,426
Excuse me, I ordered a tart!

374
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:52,429
I'm terribly sorry.

375
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,438
Sorry about that.
Here's your fruit tart.

376
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:11,481
2009.

377
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:16,586
In 3 minutes and 33 seconds,
the ferry will be hijacked.

378
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:24,527
I didn't order this...

379
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:37,574
Mind if I tell you
an amusing story?

380
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:41,945
It's about my father.

381
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:46,616
Actually, it's about the way
my father raised me.

382
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:50,487
My life's so ludicrous,
it's laughable.

383
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:57,961
The ferry won't stop until
we arrive in Hokkaido.

384
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:00,630
We might as well enjoy the voyage.

385
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:04,768
The story of my absurd life
will make the trip memorable.

386
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:08,171
Do you want to hear about it?

387
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:19,783
You see...

388
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:23,319
I wanted to be...

389
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:28,258
a champion of justice.

390
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:35,632
A champion of justice?

391
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:40,203
Isn't it ridiculous?
That's what I was raised to be.

392
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,707
To be a champion of justice?

393
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:45,875
Weird, isn't it?

394
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:53,349
It's a vague ambition,
when you think about it.

395
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,754
It's not like wanting to be
a lawyer or a soccer player.

396
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:01,224
According to my father,

397
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:06,362
the preparation was more important
than the title.

398
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:08,898
A strong body and a calm mind.

399
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:12,168
He told me that I had to
acquire those qualities.

400
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:20,643
I've been working out
since I was a kid.

401
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:24,380
And I had zen training too.

402
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:26,716
You meditated?

403
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:32,655
To have a mind as peaceful
as a stream.

404
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:36,860
A mind that stays calm and
isn't tempted by violence.

405
00:41:37,293 --> 00:41:38,862
Did you succeed?

406
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,431
I don't know.

407
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,944
Have you ever read
Atsushi Nakajima's Apprentice?

408
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:59,015
No... I'm a science major.

409
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:02,819
Let me summarize the novel for you.

410
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:05,755
It presents a problem.

411
00:42:06,022 --> 00:42:09,759
Often tyranny oppresses
the righteous.

412
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:13,062
The unjust deserve punishment.

413
00:42:13,162 --> 00:42:16,966
But we hardly ever hear that justice wins.

414
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:21,471
That's the summary.

415
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:26,676
The book was from my father.
It left me perplexed.

416
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:30,446
Was it the wording?

417
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:33,983
The novel is set in
the time of Confucius.

418
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:39,355
It's scary to realize how
oppression has always ruled.

419
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:41,491
Don't you agree?

420
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:46,029
Justice hasn't won since
the beginning of time.

421
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:48,965
It's ridiculous.

422
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,969
It's so ridiculous...

423
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:56,539
It's a shame.

424
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:06,215
Why did your father want you to
be a champion of justice?

425
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:12,555
I'll tell you more later.

426
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:18,027
I have a pie in the oven.

427
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:31,441
A champion of justice.

428
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:36,846
We overheard you talking.

429
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:42,652
We might not be young,
but we have good hearing.

430
00:43:42,652 --> 00:43:44,253
That was some story.

431
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:47,857
Do you think it's true?

432
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,928
Maybe he has ulterior motives.

433
00:44:01,804 --> 00:44:04,674
We have an announcement.

434
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:09,545
You are advised to follow the
armed men's instructions.

435
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:12,215
I repeat.

436
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:18,421
Follow the armed men's instructions.

437
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:22,025
I repeat.

438
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:28,364
You are advised to follow the
armed men's instructions.

439
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:40,309
It's a hijack.

440
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:42,612
What for?

441
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:54,590
People.

442
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,062
Listen.

443
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:04,801
From now on, this ferry is
Noah's Ark.

444
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:09,405
To take a voyage to the new world.

445
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,077
What's this about?

446
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:26,289
Try not to be reckless.
We have many friends.

447
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:29,759
here and there...
all over this vessel.

448
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:32,562
You might not know
what's going on but

449
00:45:32,762 --> 00:45:35,898
remember we'll shoot
anybody who resists.

450
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:42,972
We might shoot you even
if you don't resist.

451
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:09,065
Look, that's the apple pie we ordered.

452
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:38,948
The champion of justice.

453
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:42,285
So it was true.

454
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:43,886
No kidding?

455
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:15,751
Didn't you hear them warn you?

456
00:49:16,218 --> 00:49:20,356
Our friends are all over
this vessel.

457
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:25,027
I had my eye on you,
high school girl.

458
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:29,332
I knew she'd be perfect
as our first victim.

459
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:32,601
Please don't shoot her.

460
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:15,177
Learning how to be a champion of justice

461
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:27,890
Every day of my childhood
was spent training.

462
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:06,128
I had no time to play with friends.

463
00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:18,307
And I didn't know what I was
doing it for either.

464
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:20,843
Do you see what I mean?

465
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:25,314
How often does a champion of justice
get to use his skills?

466
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:46,268
When I fought the school bullies...

467
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:51,140
the teacher lectured me on
how violence was bad.

468
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:57,880
I often had a good cry with Mom.

469
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:02,952
But don't get me wrong.

470
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:08,357
I really loved my father.

471
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:13,329
When he watched me
do my training

472
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:16,632
he looked at me so affectionately.

473
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,505
I always had that impression.

474
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:27,510
Don't talk anymore.

475
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:29,778
You're wounded.

476
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:34,583
The bullet went straight through.
It doesn't count as a wound.

477
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:37,186
Of course it does!

478
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:55,704
Well maybe...

479
00:52:55,704 --> 00:53:01,610
I feel so grateful to my father now...

480
00:53:06,348 --> 00:53:10,819
I never thought I'd ever get
a chance to use my skills.

481
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:18,627
If it wasn't for my father...

482
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,770
This won't stop
the champion of justice...

483
00:53:31,774 --> 00:53:32,474
... Here.

484
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:50,159
Just like that.

485
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:09,545
I'm glad they didn't shoot you.

486
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:27,830
He's the champion of justice.

487
00:54:28,664 --> 00:54:31,200
The champion of justice.

488
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:37,506
I have to go.

489
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:40,209
Thank you.

490
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:44,113
Thank my father.

491
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,393
We're saved.

492
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:02,698
Yes, he'll definitely save us.

493
00:55:10,406 --> 00:55:12,007
I know.

494
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:55,851
Resuming our broadcast.
We're now back with our broadcast.

495
00:55:57,486 --> 00:56:00,322
5 hours to impact but
we have information

496
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:05,227
about a space vehicle being launched
with nuclear missiles.

497
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:07,262
I repeat.

498
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:13,068
But the Americans gave up long ago.
They're digging shelters.

499
00:56:14,937 --> 00:56:17,373
Is it the Russians or French?

500
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:19,875
We have news on the space vehicle.

501
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,880
It's an Indian rocket ship.

502
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,151
What? I didn't know the Indians
had rocket ships.

503
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:37,693
I have no details yet but 5 experts
were sent on this mission.

504
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:41,096
They're quoted as saying,

505
00:56:41,663 --> 00:56:44,166
"Just as music knows no borders"

506
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:49,037
"we've come together
in this emergency."

507
00:56:49,538 --> 00:56:53,509
The 5 crew members have never been
on a space mission before...

508
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:57,579
It won't work then.

509
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:03,218
They plan to dispatch
nuclear missiles on to the comet.

510
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:07,322
to detonate bombs left there
by the USA six months ago.

511
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:11,593
They hope that the comet
will explode into pieces.

512
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:13,796
That's how they'll do it!

513
00:57:13,896 --> 00:57:15,731
It's impossible.

514
00:57:15,831 --> 00:57:20,702
Striking a small area on the comet
from a moving vehicle is difficult.

515
00:57:20,803 --> 00:57:26,041
Plotting an accurate trajectory
requires complicated computations.

516
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:32,347
Even with a highly trained crew,
the odds of success are 0.000013%...

517
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,886
... It will be difficult.

518
00:57:39,354 --> 00:57:43,258
They're just getting foolhardy.

519
00:57:45,694 --> 00:57:46,562
Five of them...

520
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:50,399
Did he say it's a crew of five?

521
00:57:50,499 --> 00:57:53,168
Yes, it's five!

522
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:56,305
Five heroes to save the world.

523
00:57:56,972 --> 00:58:00,843
This is it! It's them!

524
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:04,746
Maradonna weaved through five
English players for a goal.

525
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:08,984
There were the Jackson 5 and
The Finger 5 and... They're all five.

526
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,792
This will save the world.

527
00:58:20,162 --> 00:58:23,732
I've got nothing.
Doing nothing at all.

528
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,936
I've got nothing.
Doing nothing at all.

529
00:58:30,439 --> 00:58:32,774
I've got nothing.
Doing nothing at all.

530
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,613
What kind of noise is this?

531
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:39,548
It's too loud!

532
00:58:39,781 --> 00:58:41,283
Somebody stop those boys.

533
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:16,818
Play something quieter.

534
00:59:17,686 --> 00:59:20,625
Give us Enka ballads!
Or folk music!

535
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:11,873
That's how we like it!

536
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,517
I only love you
I believed what you said

537
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:28,256
When you said
You'd only love me

538
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:34,162
Searching,
I'm still searching for my love

539
01:00:34,262 --> 01:00:38,967
Wandering,
Alone with a broken heart

540
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:43,839
Up and down those
Cobblestone streets

541
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:49,544
I'm in Nagasaki today
And it's raining again

542
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:09,091
"Norio Okazaki,
Lemon Records"

543
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:13,095
The Beatles broke up.
Rock is in trouble.

544
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:18,834
I know you like the MC5
and The Stooges.

545
01:02:19,434 --> 01:02:23,305
And Jack Crispin.
That kind of music.

546
01:02:28,443 --> 01:02:32,881
But your music is even
more radical and new.

547
01:02:34,149 --> 01:02:36,651
You're on the right track.

548
01:02:38,186 --> 01:02:41,456
It'll take a while for
people to catch on.

549
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:46,528
But I can wait.
Let me manage you.

550
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:53,335
Deliver your music to the world.

551
01:02:54,669 --> 01:02:55,837
To the world!

552
01:02:55,937 --> 01:03:00,842
Right, that's where your music
belongs. It'll reach them.

553
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:04,146
I believe it will.

554
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:16,091
2 years later

555
01:03:25,233 --> 01:03:29,671
I've got nothing,
Doing nothing at all

556
01:03:32,774 --> 01:03:37,779
I've got nothing,
Doing nothing at all

557
01:03:39,214 --> 01:03:40,715
Sounds like a hit.

558
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:45,420
Very good.

559
01:03:45,887 --> 01:03:47,255
Soften it, good.

560
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:54,462
1975.

561
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:58,462
A year before
Sex Pistols was formed.

562
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,538
This is going to sell.

563
01:04:04,272 --> 01:04:05,874
Keep going!

564
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:11,880
This one will sell.

565
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:17,419
I've had enough of
that rich brat producer.

566
01:04:19,254 --> 01:04:21,890
He understands nothing
about our music!

567
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:25,293
Why overdub with that keyboard?

568
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:28,563
Producer Tani has some ideas
we don't.

569
01:04:29,297 --> 01:04:31,566
We never needed a producer!

570
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,568
Right, Shigeki?

571
01:04:34,502 --> 01:04:38,874
When we did that record on our own,
it didn't sell.

572
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:41,576
Okazaki-san had to do something.

573
01:04:42,844 --> 01:04:46,982
He's a good guy but he can't
make hit records.

574
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:51,820
You criticizing him, Goro?
That's new.

575
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:57,192
Okazaki-san doesn't stick
things out.

576
01:04:57,525 --> 01:05:00,729
He said he liked our music
then he brought in Tani.

577
01:05:01,062 --> 01:05:04,332
It's like saying something
was missing.

578
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:09,871
Shigeki-san.

579
01:05:11,106 --> 01:05:14,743
Drop the honorifics!
If you were older

580
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:17,078
you'd be the leader.

581
01:05:19,281 --> 01:05:23,451
You've changed. You used to
be the radical one.

582
01:05:28,356 --> 01:05:31,026
We're pros. We can't afford
that shit anymore.

583
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:37,165
I have to deal with the
record company execs, the media...

584
01:05:37,832 --> 01:05:40,101
I have to everything.

585
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:05,393
What is it, Goro?

586
01:06:07,562 --> 01:06:08,596
What?

587
01:06:09,064 --> 01:06:11,833
You started to say something.

588
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:17,806
If they aren't fried, they can't
be called fried noodles.

589
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,275
They're still good.

590
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:22,243
But they aren't fried.

591
01:06:25,146 --> 01:06:26,748
That's deep, Goro...

592
01:06:28,316 --> 01:06:32,520
I'm telling you, I'll never
play my guitar like those phonies.

593
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:36,024
They don't play with soul.

594
01:06:46,568 --> 01:06:48,703
Make sure you come tomorrow!

595
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,772
And write some lyrics!

596
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:01,149
Shigeki-san...

597
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,252
Drop the san, damn it!

598
01:07:05,787 --> 01:07:14,062
I overheard some bad news.

599
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:18,666
We have to talk about this.

600
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:24,239
I was dozing when Okazaki
and the President came in.

601
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:28,143
It's about the Gekirin boys.

602
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:36,284
What did the President want?

603
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:48,196
To cancel our contract?

604
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:54,369
He said, "We can't afford"

605
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:59,007
"to make three albums with
those talentless losers."

606
01:08:01,076 --> 01:08:02,777
Talentless losers?

607
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:16,558
You could've told us sooner!

608
01:08:16,658 --> 01:08:17,792
Sorry.

609
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,998
What did Okazaki say to
the President?

610
01:08:26,401 --> 01:08:27,869
"Just this one then."

611
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:31,005
That's all he could say.

612
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,342
Our last album...

613
01:08:40,815 --> 01:08:46,488
If it sold, then the President
might see things differently...

614
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:49,357
You know, Shigeki.

615
01:08:51,726 --> 01:08:53,161
It won't sell.

616
01:08:57,499 --> 01:08:58,633
I know.

617
01:09:01,536 --> 01:09:04,572
Nobody understands our music.

618
01:09:04,906 --> 01:09:07,909
And to make matters complicated...

619
01:09:08,776 --> 01:09:10,111
What?

620
01:09:14,516 --> 01:09:18,653
We believe there's nothing wrong
with our music.

621
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:24,592
So true.

622
01:09:30,965 --> 01:09:36,004
I'd better start looking
for another job to pay the bills.

623
01:09:39,574 --> 01:09:40,608
See ya!

624
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:51,152
What will you do, Goro?

625
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:55,023
Will we go amateur again?

626
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:38,896
Hi.

627
01:10:42,303 --> 01:10:45,073
So Goro told you already?

628
01:10:47,976 --> 01:10:51,746
How come nobody told
us before?

629
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:54,749
Who can...?

630
01:11:00,655 --> 01:11:02,090
Poor Goro.

631
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:07,462
He has to choose between a
solo career and his friends.

632
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:15,136
Okazaki-san...

633
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:22,677
I didn't know that.

634
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:30,985
All I knew was that tomorrow's
recording would be our last.

635
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:41,129
You didn't know...

636
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,411
Did you hear?

637
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:08,222
That's how it is.

638
01:12:08,623 --> 01:12:12,427
The President only wants to
keep you.

639
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:19,701
I'm sorry.

640
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:32,714
Where are you going?

641
01:12:32,814 --> 01:12:33,881
I'll talk to Goro!

642
01:12:33,981 --> 01:12:35,049
No, you don't.

643
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:39,187
Let go! Why didn't he tell you?

644
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,055
Sorry about this.

645
01:12:41,155 --> 01:12:45,493
All Goro thinks about is Goro!
He doesn't care about the band.

646
01:12:45,593 --> 01:12:48,262
You do all the dirty work, Shigeki.

647
01:12:48,396 --> 01:12:52,033
He's not cut out to be a leader.

648
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:53,568
You think you are?

649
01:12:53,668 --> 01:12:55,236
Only Shigeki can do it.

650
01:12:55,336 --> 01:12:59,374
Ryoji is too quick-tempered.
Tetsuya has seven kids to feed.

651
01:12:59,474 --> 01:13:02,043
The band only lasted
because of Shigeki.

652
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:03,811
Shut up, old man!

653
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:05,012
Yes, ma'am.

654
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:05,980
Sorry.

655
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,818
If Goro cared about the band,
why didn't he talk to you?

656
01:13:11,152 --> 01:13:15,490
He doesn't care about the
sacrifices Shigeki's made.

657
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:21,095
The band's nothing to Goro!

658
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:25,533
As long as he has his own future
worked out.

659
01:13:25,633 --> 01:13:28,302
What does he care about us?

660
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:30,438
No, Goro cares...

661
01:13:32,573 --> 01:13:34,442
He cares...

662
01:13:34,742 --> 01:13:36,644
Do something, Shigeki.

663
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:40,715
Goro's going to betray you.

664
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:42,617
Don't let him...

665
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:55,196
Sorry about this.

666
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:31,432
What's this book?

667
01:14:34,068 --> 01:14:37,572
I just grabbed it off the shelf.
You can have it.

668
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:56,924
"Fish Story"

669
01:15:08,636 --> 01:15:11,072
"The story of my solitude.
If it were a fish"

670
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:13,808
"it'd be so militant
a whale would fear it."

671
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:18,446
If my solitude were a fish...

672
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:21,883
It'd be so enormous, so militant,
a whale would get out of there.

673
01:15:22,316 --> 01:15:25,019
I know it would.
I'm sure it would...

674
01:15:26,153 --> 01:15:29,757
I rewrote a passage from
Okazaki-san's book.

675
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:33,828
It's not a good idea to steal.

676
01:15:34,595 --> 01:15:36,797
It's not stealing, it's a quote.

677
01:15:37,798 --> 01:15:41,969
Nobody will sue us over this.
Trust me.

678
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:45,573
I don't believe anything you
say anymore.

679
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:52,647
You're late.

680
01:15:53,447 --> 01:15:55,249
Here, the new song.

681
01:15:55,816 --> 01:15:58,386
Let's get it done with.
Come on.

682
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:15,770
This album is taking way too
long to record.

683
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,705
Let's get snappy.

684
01:16:18,839 --> 01:16:20,474
Time is money.

685
01:16:20,808 --> 01:16:24,176
Like Congress, the longer they
deliberate, the more it costs.

686
01:16:56,277 --> 01:17:00,648
This is awesome!
I love the lyrics, it has a beat.

687
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:02,383
Yeah, a good tune.

688
01:17:03,384 --> 01:17:07,021
I suggest we slow this down.

689
01:17:07,321 --> 01:17:09,557
Keep the guitar down.
Make it mellow.

690
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:12,326
How can this be mellow?

691
01:17:13,227 --> 01:17:15,062
Why don't we make a ballad album?

692
01:17:15,162 --> 01:17:18,699
Bullshit! I'll play it even faster!

693
01:17:19,967 --> 01:17:21,669
Slow will sell better.

694
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:26,874
I'm not going to let you
fuck with this tune.

695
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:31,178
There's no way, man.

696
01:17:31,278 --> 01:17:35,182
Only amateurs indulge themselves.

697
01:17:37,818 --> 01:17:39,353
Shut up, rich kid.

698
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:57,905
What do you think of this song,
Okazaki-san?

699
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:04,745
Talk to us, Okazaki-san.

700
01:18:20,194 --> 01:18:21,796
It'll never sell.

701
01:18:36,744 --> 01:18:38,012
Mr. Tani.

702
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:42,149
I'm not trying to override
your decision but

703
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:46,754
can we play this the way it is?

704
01:18:47,054 --> 01:18:50,624
This isn't child's play, you know?

705
01:18:50,991 --> 01:18:53,194
I have responsibilities too.

706
01:18:53,494 --> 01:18:57,098
Let us play this song our way.

707
01:18:58,165 --> 01:18:59,533
Listen to me.

708
01:18:59,633 --> 01:19:00,835
Come on, man.

709
01:19:02,236 --> 01:19:06,807
This is the last time we
record together.

710
01:19:07,241 --> 01:19:10,044
Let us have it our way just once.

711
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:27,595
What do you mean, this is the
last recording?

712
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:32,533
Just what he said.

713
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:37,171
We're getting the boot
after we finish this.

714
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:39,406
Seriously?

715
01:19:43,244 --> 01:19:45,079
What about live performances?

716
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:48,182
They'll let us do a few.

717
01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:52,753
If this record sells well,
it'll change the situation.

718
01:19:57,124 --> 01:19:58,359
What?

719
01:19:59,593 --> 01:20:01,395
I think you know, Ryoji.

720
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:04,231
It won't sell.

721
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:09,937
I know that.

722
01:20:11,705 --> 01:20:15,442
Nobody has time for
a band that makes no money.

723
01:20:18,746 --> 01:20:22,016
Since when did you become
so mature?

724
01:20:22,116 --> 01:20:23,918
I'm nowhere near you.

725
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:29,190
We've done OK.

726
01:20:30,591 --> 01:20:33,093
Yeah, we've been great.

727
01:20:41,869 --> 01:20:43,404
I've persuaded him.

728
01:20:43,704 --> 01:20:45,639
Let's play it like you did now.

729
01:20:46,407 --> 01:20:50,911
But we only get one take.
We record it and that's it.

730
01:20:51,278 --> 01:20:52,379
One take?

731
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:54,281
Are you scared?

732
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:57,618
No. If we fuck up, you'll have
to live with it.

733
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:21,035
The story of my solitude

734
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:25,706
If my solitude were a fish

735
01:22:29,543 --> 01:22:32,646
It'd be so enormous, so militant

736
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:39,453
A whale would get out of there

737
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,389
I know it would

738
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:47,861
I'm sure it would

739
01:23:03,277 --> 01:23:08,215
The story of my solitude
If my solitude were a fish

740
01:23:08,749 --> 01:23:14,088
It'd be so enormous, so militant
A whale would get out of there

741
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:19,560
Don't assume that I'm dead
Don't assume that I'm dead

742
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,565
Music stacked up like wooden blocks
Is the only salvation

743
01:23:25,232 --> 01:23:30,237
The story of my failure
If my failure were a fish

744
01:23:30,771 --> 01:23:36,010
It'd be so tragically comic
I'd have no place in the sea to be

745
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:41,448
Don't you know you're a liar!
Don't you know you're a deceiver!

746
01:23:41,715 --> 01:23:46,520
Music stacked up like wooden blocks
Is the champion of justice!

747
01:24:03,637 --> 01:24:06,440
If my justice really were a fish

748
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,976
It'd be so greedy and arrogant

749
01:24:09,176 --> 01:24:14,381
I'd pump the magma
Out of the ocean bed!

750
01:24:23,824 --> 01:24:24,858
Okazaki-san...

751
01:24:28,262 --> 01:24:35,269
Do you think this will reach them?

752
01:24:35,602 --> 01:24:38,505
Is somebody really
listening out there?

753
01:24:38,839 --> 01:24:41,508
If there's anybody, I want to know.

754
01:24:42,376 --> 01:24:43,710
Is this reaching you?

755
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:52,086
How can such a great song
not reach anybody?

756
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:53,854
I can't believe it.

757
01:24:54,321 --> 01:24:56,657
It's got to reach somebody.

758
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:03,730
Somebody, please...

759
01:25:08,202 --> 01:25:09,303
... please.

760
01:25:14,975 --> 01:25:19,246
The story of my solitude
If my solitude were a fish

761
01:25:20,414 --> 01:25:25,085
It'd be so enormous, so militant
A whale would get out of there.

762
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:41,935
That was great.

763
01:25:44,538 --> 01:25:46,073
Great performance.

764
01:25:51,044 --> 01:25:53,180
Goro, what was that about?

765
01:25:53,747 --> 01:25:56,683
You threw me off completely.

766
01:25:56,783 --> 01:25:59,553
Yeah! That was kind of embarrassing.

767
01:26:00,187 --> 01:26:02,089
Well, you know...

768
01:26:02,656 --> 01:26:07,227
Imagine if no one listened to
a cool song like that.

769
01:26:08,829 --> 01:26:10,430
So you were complaining?

770
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:19,439
We'll have to overdub that part.
Let's do it after the break.

771
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:22,709
Oh, I thought we only had one take?

772
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:26,547
You have to redo it. We can't
have that in the end product.

773
01:26:26,647 --> 01:26:28,815
We won't record it again.

774
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:32,920
Like I said, that's it.

775
01:26:34,054 --> 01:26:35,322
It wasn't bad.

776
01:26:36,089 --> 01:26:40,861
It was incredible.
And nothing will make it better.

777
01:26:41,328 --> 01:26:46,466
What are we going to do with that
naive soliloquy of Goro's?

778
01:26:47,334 --> 01:26:50,604
We can erase it. We'll just cut
that part out.

779
01:26:51,271 --> 01:26:52,105
What do you mean?

780
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,876
Let's just mute the sound.

781
01:26:56,643 --> 01:26:58,445
That should work out.

782
01:26:58,612 --> 01:27:00,681
What's the point of muting it?

783
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:03,350
We should reassemble it.

784
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:08,088
No. Let's go for something weird.

785
01:27:09,489 --> 01:27:13,160
Come on, they're not The Beatles.

786
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,896
It'll only appear amateurish.

787
01:27:19,266 --> 01:27:23,470
I know I fucked up. Why don't
we do the whole song again?

788
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,105
No, that was good.

789
01:27:26,873 --> 01:27:29,776
It would be crude if we left
it like that.

790
01:27:30,344 --> 01:27:31,211
Trust me.

791
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:37,784
It won't sell anyway.

792
01:27:57,337 --> 01:27:58,739
Fish Story.

793
01:28:00,173 --> 01:28:01,608
For the song title.

794
01:28:03,777 --> 01:28:06,079
I like it.

795
01:28:07,447 --> 01:28:08,548
It's good.

796
01:28:08,782 --> 01:28:12,085
That's plagiarism.

797
01:28:12,419 --> 01:28:13,887
It's quoting.

798
01:28:15,622 --> 01:28:17,991
Maybe we can change it slightly.

799
01:28:19,026 --> 01:28:22,629
How about Fish Stories?

800
01:28:24,698 --> 01:28:26,733
Why is it plural?

801
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:31,872
Fish Story...

802
01:28:33,273 --> 01:28:34,841
Fish story.

803
01:28:39,079 --> 01:28:41,515
OK, we'll call it that.

804
01:28:41,615 --> 01:28:44,217
It won't sell anyway.

805
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:54,928
Now we're going to fade away...

806
01:28:55,796 --> 01:28:59,866
Does that make everything
we've done meaningless?

807
01:29:03,203 --> 01:29:05,272
"If my solitude were a fish..."

808
01:29:07,207 --> 01:29:08,508
What does it mean?

809
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,676
Beats me.

810
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:15,549
Don't you think there's something
philosophical behind it?

811
01:29:16,249 --> 01:29:20,220
Otherwise nobody would say,
"If my solitude were a fish."

812
01:29:20,687 --> 01:29:22,556
I know what you mean but...

813
01:29:23,924 --> 01:29:27,361
Our song is quoting this book.

814
01:29:28,428 --> 01:29:30,497
It's a deep song.

815
01:29:32,332 --> 01:29:37,371
Our song has got to
reach somebody someday.

816
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:42,242
But you know...

817
01:29:42,409 --> 01:29:43,443
What?

818
01:29:44,177 --> 01:29:45,979
You don't fry udon noodles.

819
01:29:48,582 --> 01:29:50,450
It's good. Try it!

820
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,985
- You're deep, Goro.
- Try it.

821
01:29:52,152 --> 01:29:53,653
You don't fry them.

822
01:29:57,758 --> 01:29:59,326
An omelet, rice and a beer.

823
01:30:00,227 --> 01:30:00,927
Your kid?

824
01:30:03,063 --> 01:30:04,798
My wife left me.

825
01:30:10,804 --> 01:30:14,941
Okazaki-san, we'll borrow this title
for our song.

826
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:16,343
Great.

827
01:30:17,144 --> 01:30:19,346
Are we OK about the rights?

828
01:30:19,813 --> 01:30:22,482
Don't worry. Trust me.

829
01:30:22,816 --> 01:30:24,718
We have to worry then.

830
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:30,690
That's the only copy of the
book in the world.

831
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:32,459
The only copy?

832
01:30:32,559 --> 01:30:34,161
It's a recalled product.

833
01:30:34,795 --> 01:30:38,298
My aunt used to be an accountant
for a publisher.

834
01:30:38,398 --> 01:30:40,901
She kept this copy.

835
01:30:41,902 --> 01:30:45,639
I don't really get it, but why
were the books recalled?

836
01:30:48,074 --> 01:30:53,780
My aunt told me that after the war,
there was a translator shortage.

837
01:30:54,181 --> 01:30:57,918
The publisher she worked for
was very small.

838
01:30:58,318 --> 01:31:03,323
They looked everywhere for
a translator with no success.

839
01:31:03,423 --> 01:31:08,662
As they'd paid for the book rights,
they had to publish it or go bankrupt.

840
01:31:10,063 --> 01:31:12,899
And one day out of the blue

841
01:31:12,999 --> 01:31:16,536
an American-Japanese guy turned up
looking for a job.

842
01:31:17,904 --> 01:31:21,475
For the company, he was like a savior.

843
01:31:22,342 --> 01:31:25,412
Anybody who spoke English
would have done.

844
01:31:26,613 --> 01:31:31,218
He was hired on the spot.
Nobody checked his background.

845
01:31:33,086 --> 01:31:38,492
He'd been looking for a sales
position, without success.

846
01:31:38,892 --> 01:31:41,962
Work was scarce in those days.

847
01:31:42,929 --> 01:31:46,566
He had a pregnant wife and
needed money.

848
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:50,971
He agreed to translate the book.

849
01:31:53,373 --> 01:31:56,510
Everybody thought
the company was saved.

850
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:00,647
But they were wrong.

851
01:32:01,014 --> 01:32:02,048
How come?

852
01:32:02,482 --> 01:32:04,317
He was Japanese.

853
01:32:05,318 --> 01:32:09,556
He looked like a foreigner, but he
was a third-generation Tokyo-ite.

854
01:32:12,759 --> 01:32:15,395
He didn't know any English either.

855
01:32:16,196 --> 01:32:21,468
Word for word, he translated from
a dictionary... and it was terrible.

856
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:27,874
He thought it was a story
about a fish.

857
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:29,876
It isn't?

858
01:32:31,278 --> 01:32:35,415
Fish Story means an
exaggerated story.

859
01:32:35,582 --> 01:32:36,416
It does?

860
01:32:36,516 --> 01:32:37,817
That's right.

861
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:41,955
You'd better study harder.

862
01:32:43,123 --> 01:32:45,892
So, "A fish story of my own solitude"

863
01:32:45,992 --> 01:32:48,962
became, "The story of solitude,
if it were a fish."

864
01:32:50,163 --> 01:32:52,032
So it's all nonsense.

865
01:32:56,236 --> 01:32:58,305
Nonsense?

866
01:33:00,774 --> 01:33:03,109
One of the stories of post-war chaos.

867
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:08,315
I went to see my aunt before she
died and she gave me the book.

868
01:33:09,449 --> 01:33:11,718
I guess she didn't want it.

869
01:33:15,422 --> 01:33:16,489
What's wrong?

870
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:17,924
Go-Rangers...

871
01:33:22,429 --> 01:33:25,532
He wanted to watch Go-Rangers.

872
01:33:27,233 --> 01:33:29,135
What are the Go-Rangers?

873
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:33,873
Five superheroes, like Masked Rider.

874
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:39,145
My kids love them. They fight over
which ranger they want to be.

875
01:33:40,347 --> 01:33:43,016
I personally like the Yellow Ranger.

876
01:33:43,283 --> 01:33:46,086
You mean they have
five heroes these days?

877
01:33:47,787 --> 01:33:50,223
It's on! Come sit here.

878
01:33:51,758 --> 01:33:56,096
Summon the power of Five
and save the world, Go-Rangers!

879
01:33:59,532 --> 01:34:01,234
To be continued.

880
01:34:02,068 --> 01:34:03,770
Oh, I'm sorry.

881
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:05,839
Don't cry.

882
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:09,009
Let's eat curry like
the Yellow Ranger.

883
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:11,778
Let's not do it.

884
01:34:12,212 --> 01:34:13,713
No curry?

885
01:34:13,847 --> 01:34:17,050
I'm talking about the title.

886
01:34:17,684 --> 01:34:18,785
Why not?

887
01:34:18,952 --> 01:34:21,655
I don't want a song called
"A big lie".

888
01:34:23,089 --> 01:34:26,660
It's a great title.
I love "Fish Story".

889
01:34:29,396 --> 01:34:33,667
People all over the world will
hear our song one day.

890
01:34:33,967 --> 01:34:36,269
Even if it takes decades.

891
01:34:37,804 --> 01:34:41,141
I believe so, and I'll keep
believing that.

892
01:34:43,543 --> 01:34:44,944
It's a fish story.

893
01:34:45,512 --> 01:34:48,181
But you said the same thing yourself.

894
01:34:48,281 --> 01:34:51,518
I was serious.
Let's not have it as a title.

895
01:34:52,886 --> 01:34:53,787
Yeah.

896
01:34:53,887 --> 01:34:54,954
I don't mind it.

897
01:34:55,055 --> 01:34:56,122
No!

898
01:34:56,289 --> 01:35:00,060
Okazaki-san says it's great.
He jinxed it!

899
01:35:01,227 --> 01:35:06,166
Anyway, we'll get complaints about
the muted part.

900
01:35:06,466 --> 01:35:10,170
You think so?
I think it works.

901
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:12,238
In what way?

902
01:35:13,339 --> 01:35:16,576
Well, for example...

903
01:35:18,244 --> 01:35:20,313
How about this?

904
01:35:20,847 --> 01:35:24,784
There's a man,
listening to Fish Story.

905
01:35:25,285 --> 01:35:27,654
He's at a cafe or something.

906
01:35:28,188 --> 01:35:32,125
He sits with his eyes closed,
concentrating on the song.

907
01:35:32,659 --> 01:35:35,195
Then comes the muted part.

908
01:35:38,765 --> 01:35:42,268
He hears a woman's voice
and looks up.

909
01:35:42,368 --> 01:35:43,336
What...?

910
01:35:43,436 --> 01:35:46,406
Maybe it was a waitress
who talked to him.

911
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:49,976
He's startled and looks up.

912
01:35:50,243 --> 01:35:55,215
Their eyes meet and they fall
in love! It's unlikely...

913
01:35:55,315 --> 01:35:58,952
And they live happily ever after.

914
01:35:59,052 --> 01:36:00,954
There you go.

915
01:36:01,054 --> 01:36:03,656
All thanks to your song.

916
01:36:03,757 --> 01:36:06,559
Well, was it really due to the music?

917
01:36:06,693 --> 01:36:08,862
Soon, they have a child.

918
01:36:08,962 --> 01:36:10,363
It goes on?

919
01:36:10,463 --> 01:36:11,531
Of course.

920
01:36:11,631 --> 01:36:15,368
The child becomes a great person.
How's that?

921
01:36:15,769 --> 01:36:17,704
Great at what?

922
01:36:18,304 --> 01:36:19,806
A Nobel Prize winner?

923
01:36:19,906 --> 01:36:21,541
That's dumb.

924
01:36:21,641 --> 01:36:27,313
Maybe the child prevents World War 3
and wins the Prize.

925
01:36:28,181 --> 01:36:29,315
Nobel Peace Prize!

926
01:36:36,689 --> 01:36:37,724
It won't happen.

927
01:36:39,592 --> 01:36:40,660
No.

928
01:36:42,061 --> 01:36:43,596
It's a fish story.

929
01:36:44,097 --> 01:36:47,734
That's what it's called.

930
01:36:50,203 --> 01:36:51,938
If it's a fish story

931
01:36:52,071 --> 01:36:56,576
make it a story of our hardcore fans
saving the world together.

932
01:36:56,676 --> 01:36:58,545
Most unlikely.

933
01:36:59,813 --> 01:37:00,880
Never.

934
01:37:01,347 --> 01:37:04,918
We failed to reach people
of this generation.

935
01:37:05,451 --> 01:37:07,620
But our song goes beyond time.

936
01:37:09,889 --> 01:37:12,392
Something like that could happen.

937
01:37:12,959 --> 01:37:15,895
Isn't it the way the world turns?

938
01:37:18,097 --> 01:37:22,569
Fish Story will one day
save the world.

939
01:37:26,506 --> 01:37:27,841
No way!

940
01:37:30,243 --> 01:37:32,178
Don't say that!

941
01:37:33,446 --> 01:37:35,048
Let's drink to us.

942
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,642
We've come to the last 60 minutes.

943
01:38:02,809 --> 01:38:05,011
Impact will be in 1 hour.

944
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:11,251
Data is insufficient.
The angle is unexpected.

945
01:38:13,253 --> 01:38:17,757
We need more time to plot
the exact orbit of the comet.

946
01:38:18,892 --> 01:38:22,896
Santos, when will the missiles
be ready?

947
01:38:24,898 --> 01:38:27,100
We have no time.

948
01:38:27,734 --> 01:38:30,770
It's fucked, it's over.

949
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:33,039
We're not going to make it.

950
01:38:36,109 --> 01:38:39,646
1 hour to impact.

951
01:38:40,213 --> 01:38:43,182
Get ready for the tidal wave.

952
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:47,287
Evacuate to elevated places.
I repeat...

953
01:38:47,387 --> 01:38:51,591
It won't take long, the final moment.

954
01:38:51,758 --> 01:38:53,826
It'll be over in a moment.

955
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:58,531
There will be a tidal wave.
Evacuate to elevated places.

956
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:03,469
The tidal wave will affect
all of Japan...

957
01:39:03,569 --> 01:39:08,408
Japan will be underwater
in the blink of an eye.

958
01:39:08,741 --> 01:39:12,679
The tidal wave will be bigger
than Mt. Fuji.

959
01:39:13,546 --> 01:39:17,150
You're wrong if you think
you could swim out of it.

960
01:39:18,117 --> 01:39:23,957
The impact will shred you
in a split second.

961
01:39:24,691 --> 01:39:29,062
We have zero percent chance
of surviving it.

962
01:39:29,162 --> 01:39:30,563
No escape.

963
01:39:34,801 --> 01:39:37,770
I thought you said you'd listen to
your records.

964
01:39:38,571 --> 01:39:43,242
You'd listen to them even if
the world ended today.

965
01:39:43,376 --> 01:39:45,178
You're running out of time.

966
01:39:52,785 --> 01:39:56,255
Yes! That's right!

967
01:40:00,994 --> 01:40:05,965
That's how you should have behaved
from the beginning.

968
01:40:07,233 --> 01:40:12,805
You shouldn't have pretended
that you weren't scared!

969
01:40:15,174 --> 01:40:17,477
I told you so!

970
01:40:21,614 --> 01:40:27,286
I've been warning you for
10 long years!

971
01:40:27,587 --> 01:40:30,790
I told you and you didn't listen...

972
01:40:49,275 --> 01:40:51,110
The Prince!

973
01:40:58,151 --> 01:40:59,252
What was that?

974
01:40:59,952 --> 01:41:01,087
Was it hit?

975
01:41:01,788 --> 01:41:02,922
Was it the bombs?

976
01:41:03,723 --> 01:41:04,791
Bull's-eye?

977
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:08,261
The missiles hit the bombs!

978
01:41:08,795 --> 01:41:13,499
The missiles launched from
the Indian vessel hit the bombs.

979
01:41:13,599 --> 01:41:16,269
The comet exploded in pieces.

980
01:41:16,869 --> 01:41:20,006
The Indian vessel rewrote history!

981
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:30,650
They did it!

982
01:41:30,783 --> 01:41:31,818
I knew it...

983
01:41:32,518 --> 01:41:35,621
There are heroes to save the day!

984

We have live footage.

985
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,569
It's from the space ship.

986
01:41:52,071 --> 01:41:55,041
I did nothing really.

987
01:41:56,008 --> 01:41:58,211
It was all thanks to her.

988
01:41:58,544 --> 01:42:00,713
She did all the calculations.

989
01:42:02,215 --> 01:42:05,051
She's so extremely clever!

990
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,858
Once asleep, no noise will wake her.

991
01:42:23,669 --> 01:42:25,438
Sorry...

992
01:42:26,506 --> 01:42:27,554
I'm sorry.
