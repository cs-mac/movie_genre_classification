<i>Gun Wook.</i>

00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,499
Gun Wook.

5
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:25,916
- Gun Wook. Shim Gun Wook!
- You're getting wet.

00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:28,961
<i>Shim Gun Wook!</i>

7
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:38,506
Hello?

8
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:41,377
What?

9
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,419
Shim Gun Wook has disappeared?

10
00:00:56,562 --> 00:00:58,111
Shim Gun Wook.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,892
You...
You're here?

12
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:34,852
Stop right there.

13

<i>Shim Gun Wook.</i>

14
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:42,783
<i>He's someone who messed with me.</i>

15
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:45,751
<i>You think I'm just going let him be?</i>

16
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,463
<i>Shim Gun Wook, Shim Gun Wook</i>

17
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:54,006
<i>- He's someone who messed with me...
- Where'd he go?</i>

18
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,930
<i>You think I'm just, you think,
you think I'm just going to let him be?</i>

19
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:57,988
Where did he go?

20
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,255
<i>Whoever does it, it has to get done,
whoever does it, it has to get done...</i>

21
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:06,130
You! What the hell are you up to?

22
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,867
You think you can scare me like this?!

23
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:13,318
I should have cleanly gotten rid of you
like your parents twenty years ago!

24
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:16,921
Shim Gun Wook, come out.
Come out. Come out.

25
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:18,890
Come out like a man!

26
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,745
Shim Gun Wook! Come out!

27
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:23,717
Come out!
Where are you? Come out!

28
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:26,781
Come out!
Come out!

29
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:35,721
He's not outside either.

30
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,311
Did you find him?

31
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:48,577
Yes, Chief,
I came to the hospital,

32
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,422
but Gun Wook has disappeared.

33
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:16,750
You're not coming?

34
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,975
Go in on your own.

35
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:21,470
I don't want to see him much anymore.

36
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:24,219
I hope nothing has happened.
You don't think anything has, do you?

37
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm not going to come looking
for you anymore.

38
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,986
<i>Be well with Gun Wook.</i>

39
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,220
After all, he's not in good condition.

40
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,179
I'm dumping you right now.

41
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:39,538
<i>Go on.</i>

42
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:41,626
Shim Gun Wook...

43
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,657
will probably need you.

44
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:51,035
Okay, I'll be going then.

45
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:00,487
Thank you, Tae Seong.

46
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:32,525
Gun Wook...

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,597
Gun Wook, are you here?

48
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:37,832
<i>Gun Wook.</i>

49
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:39,400
Gun Wo...

50
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,256
What are you doing here again?

51
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,520
What is all this?

52
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,277
Ask Gun Wook when you see him.

53
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,464
Gun Wook... is alive?

54
00:04:58,158 --> 00:04:59,216
Is he alive?

55
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:01,311
Yes.

56
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,420
He's alive.

57
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,522
Where is he right now?

58
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:09,572
I was looking for him just now also.

59
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,081
Where did he go in his poor condition?

60
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:15,175
What do you mean his poor condition?
What's wrong?

61
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:17,457
He couldn't even recognize me.

62
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,490
He couldn't recognize you?

63
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,323
He's very unwell.

64
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:34,600
The two of you must be much closer
than I thought.

65
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:40,600
The news that he died,
and that he was alive,

66
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:43,085
<i>you knew all of it.</i>

67
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:49,833
What is this stuck to the walls?

68
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:56,926
Gun Wook was seeing me and
you were seeing Tae Seong.

69
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:01,559
Were the two of you planning
something against our family?

70
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:03,458
Is that what's important right now?

71
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,801
You feel only how wronged you
were in being deceived, don't you?

72
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,313
What about Gun Wook who couldn't
help but do what he did?

73
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,112
What about Gun Wook's scars?

74
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,310
Stop.

75
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:17,545
Why do I have to hear that sort
of thing from you?

76
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,363
And, from someone who's going to
marry Tae Seong?

77
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,469
It's over between Tae Seong and me.

78
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:24,201
Why?

79
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:28,200
Because Tae Seong turned out
not to be my father's son,

80
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,986
you no longer want to marry him?

81
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:31,625
Well, since there was never any love...

82
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,624
What do you mean?

83
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:37,587
So, you're saying it doesn't matter what
Tae Seong feels?

84
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:41,714
So, Tae Seong...

85
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,765
isn't Chairman Hong's real son?

86
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:48,697
No.

87
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:52,371
Tae Seong is alone now.

88
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:57,541
If Tae Seong has never been a son
of Haeshin from the start,

89
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:02,212
I wonder, would you have even dated him?

90
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:03,829
Right now...

91
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,359
It makes no matter to me what
position he's in.

92
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,200
What's important to me now

93
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:13,418
is who is this man that I want to be with.

94
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:16,250
So, I can't be with Tae Seong.
That...

95
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:20,304
would be unfair to Tae Seong too.

96
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:30,700
Yes, Chief, what about Gun Wook?

97
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,112
<i>They say he's been moved to
another hospital.</i>

98
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:40,683
Right now, I think it's better if
you just waited.

99
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:43,302
Okay. Anyhow, that's a relief.

100
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:45,776
<i>I understand.</i>

101
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,332
And, I thought it wouldn't taste good.

102
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:30,400
Oh, hello.

103
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:35,016
Shim Gun Wook's attendant told me
to give this to you, and I forgot.

104
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:35,930
To me?

105
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:38,470
What could it be?

106
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:57,628
Detective Lee,

107
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:02,137
- get an arrest warrant issued.
- A warrant for who?

108
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:15,467
Madam Shin Myung Won.

109
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:25,301
You are under arrest for aiding and
abetting a murder.

110
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,596
You have the right to remain silent...

111
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:30,118
What are you talking about aiding and
abetting a murder?

112
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:32,871
- Beom Woo,
- Yes?

113
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,612
- you do it.
- Yes, Sir.

114
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:37,309
You have the right to remain silent.

115
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,501
<i>Anything you say...</i>

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,949
What is this? What are you doing?
Let go of me!

117
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,322
What do you mean aiding and abetting
a murder?

118
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:43,640
<i>Let go! What is this?</i>

119
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:46,324
Name.

120
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:49,218
- Ask my lawyer when he comes.
- Shin Myung Won.

121
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:50,730
<i>Name.</i>

122
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,270
Why do you ask when you know already?

123
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:55,015
I'm trying to conduct a questioning here!

124
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,464
<i>Shin Myung Won.</i>

125
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:58,681
Name.

126
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:12,342
He prepared everything impeccably.

127
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,714
And how was Shim Gun Wook?

128
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:20,203
I suppose he couldn't forgive
the 2 faces of Shin Myung Won.

129
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,123
And so, he drove Shin Myung Won

130
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:28,000
to kill him the same way she killed
his parents,

131
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,209
and is forcing her to answer for that crime.

132
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:39,173
And to think she deceived Hong Tae Seong
for all those years.

133
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:42,001
Shim Gun Wook was shocked
to hear about that as well.

134
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:45,460
Because Hong Tae Seong was
a victim like he had been.

135
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:51,033
Because of one person,
a great many people

136
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,958
led some very difficult lives.

137
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,502
What do you think will happen?

138
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:12,602
The evidence is so clear-cut that
we don't have much of a chance.

139
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:15,575
But, thankfully, Shim Gun Wook is alive,

140
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:17,537
<i>so it won't come to the worst.</i>

141
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,128
What's going on?

142
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:25,488
<i>Mother tried to kill Shim Gun Wook?</i>

143
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:26,551
Why?

144
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:28,284
I don't know, either.

145
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:32,082
Shim Gun Wook's side has submitted
evidence.

146
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,776
I'm really going to have to see that guy.

147
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:38,849
Whoa.

148
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:44,021
This is seriously cool.

149
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:49,008
Unni!

150
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:52,538
It's too much of a waste to
just return this.

151
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,700
This is really nice.

152
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:56,259
Hey, leave it in the case.
I'm going to return it.

153
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,230
Just a sec.

154
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:58,467
Unni...

155
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:02,102
Unni, there's something engraved on it.

156
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:03,235
What?

157
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:09,513
"To Jae In."

158
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:11,778
"Be with me."

159
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:16,686
Be with me.

160
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,404
If you stay with me,

161
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:22,532
I think I could bear it, without swaying.

162
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:29,241
Tae Seong, a woman who sincerely loves you

163
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:32,248

<i>Put it in the box.</i>

Ah, Unni, it's too much of a waste
to give it back!

Aye, I would look pretty cool

Shim Gun Wook!

169
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:28,643
Shim Gun Wook, open the door!

170
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,195
<i>Do you have to lock Madame Shin
in jail?</i>

171
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,205
<i>Will that make you feel better?!
Huh?!</i>

172
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,099
You still can't shake that rage?

kicked out?</i>

<i>Feel wronged and bitter?</i>

<i>There's nothing we can do about it.</i>

180

<i>The prosecution will please begin
questioning.</i>

186
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:24,143
Defendant Shin Myung Won, on July 14th,

187
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:27,988
you told Kim Seong Jong to kill
Shim Gun Wook, correct?

188
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:29,001
No.

189
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:32,657
Why would I have such a trivial
person killed?

190
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,970
Judge, we have a recording of
the defendant's conversation.

191
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,055
<i>Please allow us to play it here.</i>

192
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,180
Please do so.

193
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:48,752
<i>Shim Gun Wook.</i>

194
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,510
<i>He's someone who messed with me.</i>

195
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:53,772
<i>You think I'm just going to let him be?</i>

196
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:59,006
<i>Whoever does it, it has to be done.
Why? Are you scared?</i>

197
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:02,279
<i>I'm not someone who will wait a long time.</i>

198
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,556
<i>Be warned,</i>

199
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,638
<i>Manager Kim, that this is your last chance.</i>

200
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:09,965
Defendant?

201
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:12,561
<i>That's your voice on the recording, correct?</i>

202
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,072
Yes, that's correct.

203
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:19,497
You ordered the killing of
Shim Gun Wook, correct?

204
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:24,136
No, I did no such thing.
Those are words I said in anger.

205
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,606
I will ask you once again.

206
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:30,150
Did you order the killing of Shim Gun Wook?

207
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:31,483
No.

208
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,447
I told you I did no such thing.

209
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:38,016
The defense shall now question
the defendant.

210
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:42,619
The defendant merely spoke in
a moment of anger.

211
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,892
But in actuality,

212
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:50,008
you didn't have any intention
of murder, did you?

213
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,198
None, whatsoever.

214
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,795
What wouldn't a person say in anger?

215
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:57,370
When seeing someone you hate,

216
00:15:57,697 --> 00:15:59,530
you say "I wish he were dead",

217
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:03,477
"I wish he'd disappear from my sight".
Everyone says that sort of thing.

218
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,467
But do they actually kill anyone?

219
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:09,153
Prosecutor, when you say,
"Oh my, this is killing me",

220
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:10,956
do you die?

221
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:13,009
You don't, do you?

222
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:15,978
Just because I said that, I would kill him?

223
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:17,730
Am I crazy?

224
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,622
To do such a thing?

225
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:23,387
When Chairman Hong had collapsed and
was bedridden,

226
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,357
in the hospital room,

227
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:29,620
Shin Myung Won told me
to get rid of Shim Gun Wook.

228
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:30,944
<i>What is this?</i>

229
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:34,569
At that time, were you actually
going to kill Shim Gun Wook?

230
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:35,538
No.

231
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:38,366
I contacted Shim Gun Wook,

232
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,559
and informed him of her intent.

233
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:48,221
You know Shin Myung Won, don't you?

234
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:48,937
No.

235
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:50,767
I don't know that person.

236
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:56,531
I submit as evidence transcripts of
their phone conversations.

237
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,315
When she found out he was alive,
she was mentally obsessed.

238
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,738
She told me to kill him again.

239
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,141
When did I?!

240
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:10,854
I don't know that person.

241
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:14,058
Someone is trying to trap me and
has conspired with all these people.

242
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:16,957
But it'll never happen.
You think I'll be taken down like this?!

243
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:19,731
I don't know that man!
I don't know him!

244
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,293
Defendant, please be silent!

245
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:26,049
We submit this video as evidence.

246
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:32,252
You! Where are you hiding?!

247
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:34,875
<i>You think you can scare me like this?!</i>

248
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:41,295
I should have cleanly gotten rid of you
like your parents twenty years ago!

249
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:43,279
<i>Where are you? Come out!</i>

250
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:45,278
<i>Where are you? Come out!</i>

251
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:48,176
<i>Where are you? Where are you?!</i>

252
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:52,532
That's a phony. Someone messed with
a computer

253
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:55,239
and made that unbelievable piece
of garbage.

254
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,528
They schemed to put me away.
They've joined with Shim Gun Wook!

255
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,000
<i>They've all schemed this!</i>

256
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:05,444
I didn't kill him! I didn't kill anyone!
I've never killed anyone!

257
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:11,582
<i>I didn't do it, didn't! I didn't kill anyone!
I didn't do it, I didn't!</i>

258
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:17,078
I didn't kill anyone, I didn't.
I didn't kill anyone.

259
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:20,531
I didn't kill anyone!

260
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:22,913
Defendant,

261
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:25,486
please give your final statement.

262
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:31,645
The nature of this disgraceful issue

263
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:36,563
is entirely humiliating and unpleasant
for Haeshin Group and myself.

264
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,767
But to expose the truth,

265
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,518
I'll bear with the indignity.

266
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,299
I am a woman who raised
someone else's child like my own.

267
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:49,065
The boy that once might have been my son...

268
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,399
Would I have really ordered him killed?

269
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,050
<i>What do I have to be anxious about?</i>

270
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,517
<i>What am I lacking?</i>

271
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:55,674
This is merely

272
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:00,003
the wicked scheming and a trick laid out
by a vengeful madman!

273
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:02,524
So dirty.

274
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,347
<i>Disgusting.</i>

275
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:05,461
Murderer.

276
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:06,757
<i>You can't do this!</i>

277
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:08,111
<i>Come out!</i>

278
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:09,832
Gun Wook lost his family to you!

279
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:11,581
And lost his identity!

280
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:15,021
<i>You've taken every shred of his life!</i>

281
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:16,976
Your lies will absolutely be exposed!

282
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:20,020
You'll pay for the rest of your life
for your crime!

283
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:22,117
You'll pay for the rest of your life
for your crime!

284
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:25,182
That manipulative girl is having
a complete tirade.

285
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,554
She can't make her way into our family.

286
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:30,648
So of course, she must be bitter and angry.

287
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:35,457
A thing like you, how dare you... to me.

288
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,411
Moon Jae In.

289
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,488
<i>Have you met with Gun Wook?</i>

290
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,692
How is he?

291
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:53,492
He seems healthy.

292
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,581
He says he'll be back soon,

293
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,004
so just wait a little longer.

294
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,222
Ah, take this.

295
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:04,487
What is this?

296
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:09,033
I was examining it, thinking it could be
evidence,

297
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,850
but something else was recorded on it.

298
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:29,557
<i>Moon Jae In, are you listening?</i>

299
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,932
<i>This is the truth behind the world
you respected.</i>

300
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:36,119
<i>What are you going to do now?</i>

301
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:37,678
<i>You decide.</i>

302
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,431
<i>I'll always be in the same place.</i>

303
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:52,796
Hong Tae Seong.

304
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:56,120
Hong Tae Seong,

305
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,550
you kill your brother,

306
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:00,858
turn your father into a dummy,

307
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,901
and toy with your little sister?

308
00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:07,775
So, did you have a nice reunion
with your father?

309
00:21:10,513 --> 00:21:13,017
What did the chairman call you that night?

310
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:15,839
"Tae Seong".

311
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:18,441
Didn't he call you that?

312
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:21,953
- You should go...
- Let go!

313
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:24,168
I should have my say before I go.

314
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:28,575
You can't even recognize your own father
and make him collapse?

315
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,839
You kill your flesh and blood?

316
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:33,894
You don't believe me?

317
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:37,309
<i>You're Hong Tae Seong.</i>

318
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:44,553
<i>No matter what anyone says,
don't forget you're Hong Tae Seong, okay?</i>

319
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:45,550
<i>The children got switched?!</i>

320
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,788
But, we even had his DNA tested...

321
00:21:49,304 --> 00:21:50,077
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

322
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:54,774
I threw away the real thing

323
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:56,665
and brought in a fake.

324
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:01,467
Ultimately, you lost your parents,
your siblings, everything.

325
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:04,726
I won.

326
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:07,986
Got it?

327
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:31,511
Young Master,

328
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:36,746
I'm sorry for speaking so late.

329
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,136
The day of the accident,

330
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,494
you said you wanted to see me.

331
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:48,533
Actually...

332
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:49,668
Tell me.

333
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,276
Actually, to block you,

334
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,343
Madam Shin told me never to say anything.

335
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:02,532
But since you know everything now...

336
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:06,886
What did Mother just say?

337
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:13,565
Gun Wook... is really Tae Seong?

338
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:15,888
Father's son,

339
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:20,443
my little brother?

340
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:59,247
Has Mother left?

341
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:01,953
Tae Seong...

342
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:16,631
<i>So, did you have a nice reunion with
your father?</i>

343
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:19,663
<i>What did the chairman call you that night?</i>

344
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:20,609
<i>"Tae Seong".</i>

345
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:22,906
<i>Tae Seong!</i>

346
00:24:23,141 --> 00:24:24,020
<i>Dad!</i>

347
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:25,420
Tae Seong's here!

348
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,298
<i>Now try saying it.</i>

349
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:35,251
<i>Dad.</i>

350
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:39,609
Dad.

351
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,109
That's right.

352
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:43,899
Tae Seong, I'm your dad.

353
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:50,738
<i>You look familiar for some reason.</i>

354
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:52,487
<i>This is our first meeting,</i>

355
00:24:52,694 --> 00:24:54,767
<i>but you really look familiar.</i>

356
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:00,204
Hello,

357
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,362
I'm Shim Gun Wook.

358
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:25,114
Shim Gun Wook's mother,

359
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,208
the woman named Chae Yeon,

360
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:32,883
worked at the reception desk at our company.

361
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,325
So I thought for sure he was the son.

362
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,966
I found it strange when they said he wasn't.

363
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:48,027
To cover up Madam Shin's wrongs,

364
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:54,857
I committed too big of a crime
against Shim Gun Wook.

365
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:05,281
But, I never thought you would help
Shim Gun Wook.

366
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,577
When I went to prison instead
of the chairman,

367
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,456
I lost my wife.

368
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:15,224
The chairman told me, after 3 years
in prison,

369
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:17,006
"You did good".

370
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:23,142
He had no interest whatsoever
that my wife was ill and died.

371
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:28,413
My feelings of loyalty and illusions
of Haeshin were shattered.

372
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:32,393
So, I went to Shim Gun Wook's
parents' grave.

373
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,736
I begged for their forgiveness.

374
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:40,689
I thought that was the only way
my feelings of guilt might be erased.

375
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:44,110
I, who couldn't protect that child,

376
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,393
am also someone who should be punished.

377
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:01,705
<i>[Non-possession, Beop Jeong]</i>

378
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:10,986
Happy Birthday to you...

379
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:15,579
Wow, people even have birthday
parties at a barbecue place.

380
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:18,446
Well, I guess they did set it up
nice like a restaurant.

381
00:28:18,537 --> 00:28:19,534
Right, Unni?

382
00:28:19,926 --> 00:28:24,019
Hey, I know the people well here,
so eat in moderation.

383
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:25,821
All right! What do you think...

384
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:28,443
Oh, Jae In! Welcome.

385
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:30,498
Your little sister, right?

386
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:33,043
- Yes, she is.
- Hello.

387
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:36,424
Well, I think it would be okay
if you joined Chief Kwak.

388
00:28:36,476 --> 00:28:38,272
That man must have no cases.

389
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:39,726
Let's go, let's go.

390
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:42,937
- Uh? Hello.
- Yes, hello.

391
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:44,038
Oh? Hello!

392
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:48,164
- Oh?
- She's my little sister.

393
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:51,838
- Ah...
- Oh? So, you know them, yeah?

394
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:53,241
<i>We're joining.</i>

395
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,227
Looks good.

396
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,500
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

397
00:28:57,526 --> 00:28:59,886
It totally melts in your mouth,
totally melts.

398
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:03,850
- But, is there no rice here?
- Rice...

399
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:08,959
There's nothing we don't have here.
Take a look.

400
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:12,450
This side is cheap stuff.
These on the front are better.

401
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,387
For now,

402
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:15,532
please bring one beef short rib stew...

403
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:16,505
Beef short rib stew.

404
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:18,496
And bring another order of sliced beef
to grill.

405
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:21,066
- Sliced beef?
- Unni, I'm going to eat a lot.

406
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:22,957
Okay, eat a lot.

407
00:29:23,974 --> 00:29:27,706
So, have you met up with Shim Gun Wook?

408
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:30,632
I thought about dropping by his place,

409
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:34,190
but it would be hard to see
a big empty place.

410
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:42,611
<i>[Resignation]</i>

411
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:45,643
I just need to write it like that, right?

412
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:46,664
Tae Seong,

413
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:52,025
there will never be any abandoning
of anyone ever again.

414
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:55,119
Right now, I can look after you,

415
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,777
look after Haeshin,
and look after the family.

416
00:29:58,949 --> 00:29:59,715
Noona,

417
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:05,454
I'd like to look after someone myself
and live on my own abilities.

418
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:07,786
Don't pay any attention to public notice.

419
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:10,318
You're Haeshin's Executive Director.

420
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,371
I don't want it.

421
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:13,308
Even if I come work at Haeshin,

422
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:15,102
I'll make it on my own ability.

423
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:17,131
<i>Not as someone's son,</i>

424
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:21,851
but just as an individual...

425
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:24,630
That's how I want to live.

426
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:26,521
Tae Seong...

427
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:29,444
Aye! If I'd have know it would be like this,

428
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,539
I should have graduated college
when he put up the tuition money.

429
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:40,443
But, do you know what's truly a relief?

430
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:43,804
When you think about it,

431
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,481
the two of you are not related
in any way.

432
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,851
You're not each other's flesh and blood.

433
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:54,728
<i>It's neither of your faults.</i>

434
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,633
So, don't be too upset.

435
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,469
Can I give you a hug?

436
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:24,571
Are you not going to see the guy?

437
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:29,141
Didn't you say no one would be
abandoned anymore?

438
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:32,455
Didn't you say you could look after
the family?

439
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:35,209
Then look after him too, to the very end.

440
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:40,238
He's family, after all.

441
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:56,351
I'll call you Shim Gun Wook
for the last time today.

442
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:08,613
Because Gun Wook and I
still have things to sort out.

443
00:33:14,353 --> 00:33:19,415
I didn't regret meeting you.

444
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:24,795
For the first time in a long time,

445
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,289
I felt fluttering

446
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:29,717
and trembling.

447
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:37,649
So, I... thought you truly...

448
00:33:42,948 --> 00:33:48,541
When, you first approached Mo Ne,
I knew your feelings weren't sincere.

449
00:33:49,722 --> 00:33:52,311
And even knowing you were
that sort of person,

450
00:33:53,062 --> 00:34:00,729
I... couldn't stop myself from being
shaken by you.

451
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:13,454
You and I... how are we...

452
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,136
Gun Wook.

453
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,139
<i>Gun Wook.</i>

454
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,077
Did you miss it?

455
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:55,204
Did you want to come back,
even if it was like this?

456
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:00,131
<i>Do you know?</i>

457
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:05,249
After you were kicked out,

458
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:12,816
it was very difficult for me too
and I felt really confused.

459
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:21,655
Even though I knew that you,
as a small child, haven't deceived us,

460
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,554
I felt betrayed.

461
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,786
<i>And I was angry.</i>

462
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,660
I'm sorry.

463
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:43,851
I hope that you might find some solace
that it was hard on me too.

464
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,922
When some time passes,

465
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,507
things will work out somehow, won't they?

466
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:54,205
And...

467
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,439
Gun Wook,

468
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:06,099
from now on,

469
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:15,925
I'll try my best to be able to
call you Tae Seong.

470
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:03,778
Tae Ra noona.

471
00:37:13,082 --> 00:37:13,874
Tae Seong.

472
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:15,863
Noona.

473
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,706
<i>It's okay, Noona.</i>

474
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,178
I'm sorry.

475
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:38,720
I'm sorry.

476
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,734
It's okay.

477
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,071
I'm sorry, Tae Seong.

478
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:50,962
<i>Noona, I'm sorry.</i>

479
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:08,940
Chairman!

480
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,910
Chairman, your hand.

481
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:12,751
Tae...

482
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,489
Tae Seong.

483
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,415
<i>You were here?</i>

484
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,814
Tae Seong.

485
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:48,361
Why is he here?

486
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:50,785
Executive Director Hong,
what brings you here?

487
00:38:51,135 --> 00:38:52,694
I came to eat.

488
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,298
Have you been well?

489
00:38:57,393 --> 00:38:58,150
Yes.

490
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:00,226
And you?

491
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:01,898
Me, well...

492
00:39:04,114 --> 00:39:06,957
I'm trying to figure out what to do.

493
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:12,772
But, have you not seen the guy yet?

494
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,802
He's probably going through
a really rough time.

495
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,364
Be with him.

496
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:26,333
It turns out I was living with everything
that was his.

497
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:30,820
They say he's Hong Tae Seong.

498
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:32,086
What...

499
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:36,742
What are you talking about?

500
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:38,632
The real Hong Tae Seong.

501
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:42,512
Mother had switched him and me.

502
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:47,452
She must not have been able
to tolerate a son he had with someone else.

503
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:48,915
Impossible.

504
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,807
He's back.

505
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,055
Go and see him.

506
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:12,965
<i>The real Hong Tae Seong, Father's son.</i>

507
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:15,072
<i>The target of his vengeance</i>

508
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,435
<i>was ultimately his family.</i>

509
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:29,476
Yes, hello?

510
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:32,238
<i>Manager Kim, it's me, Mo Ne.</i>

511
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:37,521
Shim Gun Wook, where does he live?

512
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:12,227
But, I'm not Miss, I'm Hong Mo Ne.
Hong Mo Ne.

513
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:14,489
Hong Mo Ne.

514
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:18,794
<i>Hong Mo Ne likes Shim Gun Wook!</i>

515
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:23,540
My little brother?

516
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:28,773
Hyung.

517
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,311
<i>[Hong Tae Gyun]</i>

518
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:44,742
It's hard, isn't it?

519
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:53,846
You didn't know.

520
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:01,066
You lived so long wanting vengeance.

521
00:43:02,444 --> 00:43:05,471
And now, hearing they were your family,

522
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,549
you no longer feel the resentment.

523
00:43:12,738 --> 00:43:14,441
And you're sorry,

524
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,305
and you're feeling regret.

525
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:22,458
That's what family is.

526
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:27,486
No.

527
00:43:28,307 --> 00:43:31,509
What I did, what I caused...

528
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:36,511
No, those people,

529
00:43:37,556 --> 00:43:39,838
I'm sure they've forgiven you.

530
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:44,985
They might even be wanting to see you.

531
00:43:46,408 --> 00:43:52,910
Your family, no matter how they hurt you,

532
00:43:56,686 --> 00:44:00,500
you can forgive them all, right?

533
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,067
Guess who I am.

534
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:36,316
My name is Moon Jae In.

535
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:38,009
And, who are you?

536
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:41,332
Why don't you answer?

537
00:44:41,443 --> 00:44:44,444
You need to answer that you're
Hong Tae Seong.

538
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:46,676
Again.

539
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:50,563
I'm Moon Jae In.

540
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:52,861
<i>And, who are you?</i>

541
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,444
I'm Hong...

542
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:05,923
Tae Seong.

543
00:45:11,994 --> 00:45:14,305
It's a pleasure to meet you.

544
00:47:10,906 --> 00:47:14,998
Ay, where has that girl gone?

545
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,050
Ah, Moon Jae In!

546
00:47:18,683 --> 00:47:19,744
This won't do.

547
00:47:27,073 --> 00:47:27,846
Yeah?

548
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:28,965
<i>Unni, where are you?!</i>

549
00:47:29,077 --> 00:47:30,450
Oh, Gun Wook's house.

550
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:31,854
Really?!

551
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:33,966
Can I come visit?

552
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,402
I don't know.

553
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,432
Don't you know I have Gun Wook
ahjussi in the palm of my hand?

554
00:47:40,462 --> 00:47:41,683
Would it be okay if you came?

555
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,216
I'm coming.

556
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:44,416
Okay.

557
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:47,622
Where are you?
You think you can find it?

558
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,714
Come out and meet me at the big
main street in our neighborhood.

559
00:47:53,262 --> 00:47:57,448
Ah, Gun Wook, pick up a little
around the place! I'll be right back!

560
00:49:36,483 --> 00:49:37,282
Mo Ne.

561
00:49:40,265 --> 00:49:43,187
You think because I was in the US,
I wouldn't know anything?

562
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,811
Mo Ne.

563
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,432
I hear you're the one who's done
all this to our family.

564
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:53,000
You'll hurt yourself. Put down the gun.

565
00:49:53,061 --> 00:49:54,000
Shut up!

566
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,782
And what's Jae In unni?

567
00:49:58,255 --> 00:50:03,006
Me, Tae Ra unni, and is Tae Seong oppa next?

568
00:50:03,023 --> 00:50:06,040
What? Do you want to destroy
Tae Seong too?!

569
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:09,438
Don't do this, Mo Ne.

570
00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:13,380
Don't come any closer! I'll kill you!

571
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:17,349
Why are you doing this to us?

572
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,671
Don't do this, Mo Ne.

573
00:50:19,692 --> 00:50:21,318
Don't call my name.

574
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:24,444
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
been like this.

575
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:26,053
<i>I could have lived happily.</i>

576
00:50:26,146 --> 00:50:30,396
It's because of you I've become
like this! You made me like this!

577
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,504
I wish you were dead. I wish you were dead!

578
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:41,725
- Uh? What was that noise?
- Unni!

579
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:43,430
Oh, you're here?

580
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:47,660
Wow, I'm finally going to
Gun Wook ahjussi's house, yeah?

581
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:48,883
See?

582
00:50:48,884 --> 00:50:51,928
See how great it is when you live without
worrying about that life-saving rope?

583
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:52,881
Life-saving rope?

584
00:50:53,225 --> 00:50:55,211
Gun Wook ahjussi once said

585
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:59,497
that he was going to climb the
life saving rope and climb way up there.

586
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:02,824
What's so great about what's up there?

587
00:51:03,057 --> 00:51:06,275
Going up there is basically going up
to the heavens.

588
00:51:07,428 --> 00:51:08,615
That's no good.

589
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:21,051
Put down that gun, Mo Ne.

590
00:51:21,647 --> 00:51:22,396
Huh.

591
00:51:29,116 --> 00:51:31,867
- Mo Ne...
- You call my name again and I'll really kill you.

592
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:39,196
I'm sorry, Mo Ne.

593
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:47,491
You're sorry?

594
00:51:49,215 --> 00:51:50,559
What are you sorry for?

595
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,341
What are you sorry for after all this?!

596
00:51:57,009 --> 00:51:57,821
<i>What?</i>

597
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:00,043
Are you afraid I'm going to kill you?

598
00:52:00,979 --> 00:52:02,061
<i>Is that it?!</i>

599
00:52:07,965 --> 00:52:09,054
Mo Ne,

600
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:12,190
I understand what you're saying,

601
00:52:14,527 --> 00:52:20,342
so couldn't you call me Oppa
one more time like long ago?

602
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,540
Long ago... What's long ago?

603
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,530
You're nothing to me now.

604
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:28,743
Nothing.

605
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:38,418
Not even nothing.

606
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:21,974
I can't.

607
00:53:22,044 --> 00:53:23,536
Those peppers are spicy!

608
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:25,263
Put lots in a stew.

609
00:53:40,076 --> 00:53:42,537
Let's eat these with Gun Wook ahjussi.

610
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:44,287
- Looks good.
- I can't wait.

611
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:45,626
Is his place nice?

612
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,580
His place is really nice.

613
00:53:57,076 --> 00:53:58,548
- Come on in.
- Okay.

614
00:53:58,746 --> 00:54:00,494
Oh, I told him to clean up.

615
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:01,416
Ohhh!

616
00:54:02,307 --> 00:54:03,291
<i>Where did he go?</i>

617
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:08,082
Gun Wook.

618
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:13,285
C'mon, where are you hiding?

619
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:18,954
- Unni, it's really nice.
- Hey, Shim Gun Wook.

620
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:25,372
Gun Wook must have gone somewhere.

621
00:54:25,468 --> 00:54:27,873
Ay, where has this ahjussi hiding?

622
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:31,990
- No, I think he isn't home. Where did he go?
- Unni, don't worry about it.

623
00:54:31,998 --> 00:54:34,989
This ahjussi loves playing tricks.

624
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:40,161
- What is this? He left his phone, too.
- Whoa.

625
00:54:40,548 --> 00:54:43,234
Did he go to buy ice cream for you?

626
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,423
Hey, Won In...

627
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:54,079
Do you know what Gun Wook likes best?

628
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:56,192
How would I know?

629
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:57,859
What is it?

630
00:54:58,364 --> 00:54:59,968
A traditional home-cooked meal.

631
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:03,311
I'll have to make it for him a lot.

632
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:05,064
Make him tons, tons.

633
00:55:06,235 --> 00:55:10,486
But, I don't know what foods he likes.

634
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,539
This.

635
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:13,045
Sausage?

636
00:55:13,796 --> 00:55:15,080
Besides that.

637
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,005
He must have some favorites.

638
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:22,109
I guess I'll just ask him later.

639
00:55:22,476 --> 00:55:23,709
<i>Sure, ask him!</i>

640
00:55:53,194 --> 00:55:53,959
Hey!

641
00:55:54,741 --> 00:55:56,994
Wait! Let's eat it when Gun Wook
gets here.

642
00:55:58,444 --> 00:56:00,462
Ay! I'm hungry.

643
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:02,839
Why isn't Ahjussi coming?

644
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:05,839
Didn't you say you ate a lot of
meat earlier?

645
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:06,915
That's that.

646
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:10,476
Why didn't he take his phone?

647
00:56:11,682 --> 00:56:13,587
