1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,416
Ladies and gentlemen, the most
exciting stage show you've ever seen!

2
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:16,879
Appearing live! It's Doug E Fresh
and the Get Fresh Crew!

3
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:23,174
- # Excuse me, huggy friend
- # Yes

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,715
# Have you ever seen a show
when fellows on a mic

5
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,426
# Make one minute rhymes
that don't come out right

6
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:31,102
- # Say right that's not polite
- # They never rhyme

7
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:33,439
- # Am I annoying you?
- # No, you're quite right

8
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:36,025
# Well, tonight on this very mic
you're about to hear

9
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,022
# We swear the best song rappers on the
air so, hear 'em yell scream, grovel

10
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:42,864
# Also hippity no
This is called the show

11
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:06,477
- # Hey, yo, Doug put your valleys on
- # What

12
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,016
# Yo, Rick, I was about to
But I need a shoehorn

13
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,394
- # Why
- # Because these shoes hurt my corn

14
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:14,320
# Six minutes, six minutes

15
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,450
# Six minutes Doug E Fresh, you're on
Uh-uh on, uh-uh on

16
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:22,495
# Uh-uh on uh-uh on

17
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:25,169
# Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh on

18
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,800
# Oh, oh, oh, my God

19
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,588
- # Here we go, come on
- # Come on

20
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:36,639
- # Here we go, come on
- # Come on, yo, what's wrong with that?

21
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,759
# I don't know,
there're legs all over the top

22
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:42,810
- # Oh, I forgot the date
- # Man, you did it again? Oh, no

23
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:45,599
# Here we go, come on
Here we go, come on

24
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,527
# Here we go, did we miss the show?

25
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,697
- # No, no, n-n-no, we didn't
- # Why

26
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:52,197
- # No, no, n-n-no, we didn't
- # W-W-Why

27
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:54,986
- # No, we didn't
- # Well, don't get us wrong

28
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:57,574
# 'Scuse me, Doug E
'Scuse me, Doug E

29
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,831
# 'Scuse me Doug E Fresh,
you're on uh-uh on, on, on...

30
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:49,926
Now, fellas, this is kind of
the condensed rough cut, OK?

31
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:52,053
It's very rough.

32
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:56,519
I know you guys are pressed for time
with the big show, yippee, coming up.

33
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,733
But what I need here is your input.

34
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,862
Shut the fuck up and start this shit!
My woman's waitin' for me.

35
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:06,615
- Yeah.
- OK, here we go. It's rough.

36
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,296
Don't be touchin' me, man, OK?

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,680
CB4! CB4!

38
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:32,480
CB4! CB4! CB4!

39
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:37,487
CB4! CB4! CB4!

40
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:42,778
CB4! CB4! CB4!

41
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:47,916
CB4! CB4! CB4!

42
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:59,012
Motherfucker!

43
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:17,577
CB4 in the motherfuckin' house. Yeah.

44
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:22,748
Yeah, Gusto's in the motherfuckin' house
with my man, Dead Mike.

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,081
We breakin' motherfuckers off 24-7.

46
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:29,338
- Yo, Gusto.
- Check this shit out.

47
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:33,218
# Straight outta Locash
A crazy motherfucker named Gusto

48
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,470
# I fuck your wife
'cause the bitch is a big ho

49
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:37,344
# I fuck your sister, I fuck your cat

50
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,017
# I would've fucked your mom
but the bitch is too fat...

51
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:43,304
They were the biggest
rap group in the world.

52
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:47,606
They sold more records than Elvis
Presley and Coretta Scott King combined.

53
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:52,070
They'll forever be known as
the world's most dangerous band,

54
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:54,029
Cell Block 4.

55
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,461
Yo, check this out. I'm hard-core.

56
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:05,290
I had a lid on this game.
I had this sewed up, man.

57
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,049
Then I heard these motherfuckers, CB4.

58
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:13,091
These motherfuckers is real, G.
They show me their guns, G.

59
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,558
What the fuck I'm supposed
to do now, man? Can't dance.

60
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,352
Shit's fucked up.

61
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:25,615
But I met 'em. Gusto stepped to me.
He said, "Yo, Ice. You down with CB4."

62
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,735
I was blessed, man.

63
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,037
If I had to choose one,
I'm Gusto all the way.

64
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,700
It's those gold teeth that...
Something, I don' know.

65
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,043
Gusto. Is that it?

66
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:40,422
I saw Gusto one day.
We was at a park picnic.

67
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:44,051
You know, he was with his family.

68
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:48,558
I didn't wanna trip, you know, cos his
people was there. His pops was there.

69
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:52,102
I didn't wanna trip. I just played
the background and kicked it.

70
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:54,889
I'll catch him, you know,
at a swap meet or somethin'.

71
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,688
Question, Flav.
How does CB4 fit into the world of rap?

72
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,480
Let me tell you somethin'.
They don't fit, you know?

73
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:04,529
They're kinda wack. Word up, G.

74
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:09,823
Yo, man, they perpetrators, man. The
whole nine. They real fuckin' fake, kid.

75
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:14,623
I think It's unfair that Cell Block 4
is being picked on...

76
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:19,468
At other concerts where they have
rat heads, cat heads being bit off,

77
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,725
spittin' in a cup and passing it around,
gettin' it back and drinkin' it...

78
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:28,562
First of all, motherfucker need
to cut that long shit he got drippin'.

79
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:32,309
All that shit, you know. Cut it down
my size or somethin', you know.

80
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:35,281
The first time I heard
Sweat Of My Balls,

81
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:42,071
I was naked with the first black woman
I've ever made love to.

82
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:43,831
Ooh, kinky.

83
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,951
How did that make you feel?

84
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,419
There was actually sweat on my balls.

85
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:54,593
Not everyone had the insight
to understand CB4's greatness.

86
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:57,675
Cell Black 4? Excuse me, Cell Block 4

87
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,176
has polluted the airwaves
of this nation for too long.

88
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:05,310
Their record of incitement,
lewdness, poor grammar

89
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:09,523
will see them jailed, banned
and with their feelings hurt.

90
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:13,950
As you've probably gathered, this
is not just a movie about rap music.

91
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,534
It's about much more.

92
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:17,738
It's about this great nation of ours,

93
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:20,494
and how it gives everybody
a chance to make it.

94
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:25,039
It's about three ghetto kids' rise from
the mean streets to the sales sheets.

95
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:27,296
- Excuse me.
- From the world's most notorious...

96
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:30,082
Fellas, what are you doing?

97
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,302
That must hurt. Give that back!
That's mine! I'm shooting...

98
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,552
Oh, jeez!

99
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,514
Fellas, guys, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,565
That dumbhead editor!
He cut in the wrong take.

101
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,771
A thousand apologies. I am so sorry.

102
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:49,944
Why did we hire this other man
instead of the brother man?

103
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,494
Because the other man is much cheaper
than the brother man.

104
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:57,499
Guys, what I need,
what my documentary is missing

105
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,751
is really quite simple.

106
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,501
I need to know
who Cell Block 4 really is.

107
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,086
I want to know how you guys think,
what you feel.

108
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:11,097
What do you guys eat? I don't know that.
Do you like sandwiches, fondue?

109
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:15,058
- How do you guys sleep at night?
- I'm outta here. You clown.

110
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:19,317
- This motherfucker's bullshit.
- What did I say?

111
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:22,196
Yo, chill.

112
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:25,111
I'm gonna let him hang out
with me today, all right?

113
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,696
Thanks. You're not gonna be sorry.

114
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:33,699
OK, sorry.
Come on, Herb, grab your stuff.

115
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,958
Corny ass motherfucker.

116
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,880
Again, MC, I wanna thank you
for letting me hang with you today.

117
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:44,712
It's gonna be fun. Look at that Jeep!

118
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:49,844
Cool! I drive something sorta like that.
It's a big ol' Country Squire.

119
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,271
It was my dad's car. It's sorta like it.

120
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:03,820
What MC Gusto just did
was rip up a state-issued ticket

121
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:08,202
which he has no plans of paying,
a natural act of defiance by rappers.

122
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:11,454
He's putting in a new jam
for us to listen to and...

123
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:14,542
Yo, White!
Chill on the blow-by-blow, all right?

124
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,169
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,543
# It feels like I'm living in a zoo...

126
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:21,052
I like this. Who is it?

127
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:24,600
Gold, gold, gold.

128
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:27,184
Another one goes gold.

129
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,609
I got it.

130
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,480
In Jones We Trust Productions.

131
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:36,444
If you can't trust me,
you can't Trust us.

132
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,115
You can trust
you're gonna be dead soon.

133
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,706
And guess who's next? CB4.

134
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,955
They ghost.

135
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:53,883
That was great!

136
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:59,553
Gusto, does the whole idea of CB4
getting together in just two days

137
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,936
kind of fill you with high anxiety?

138
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:08,357
Do you actually think a brother who
was rollin' and controllin' Cell Block 4

139
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:10,729
is worried about rockin' the mic?

140
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:12,610
Please!

141
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:15,777
Must be one of my bitches. Hello.

142
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:19,448
Hey, bitch, look in your
rear-view mirror, motherfucker.

143
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:20,948
Shit!

144
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,455
What's happening?

145
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:28,419
- Want me to hold the wheel?
- Get close to the motherfucker.

146
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:32,930
It's my first drive-by.

147
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,767
We gotta go.

148
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,689
Get up on 'em, man.

149
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:45,695
- My fuckin' radio!
- Need some new jams, bitch!

150
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:49,902
Ma! Ma!

151
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,202
Cool turn!

152
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,829
- Only a fool would follow me up here.
- Where are we going?

153
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,382
Stop right here!

154
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:06,132
- I'm crazy but I ain't no fool.
- I ain't no fool.

155
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:17,395
Jeez, we got all shot up.

156
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:21,857
There's only one word for
that kind of thing in my book. "Wild".

157
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:24,315
You guys OK back there?

158
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,943
MC, why were they shooting at us?

159
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:29,321
Us? Us?

160
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,459
They weren't shooting at us.
They were shootin' at me.

161
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:37,466
I could've died today. It'd have gone
down as a simple-ass drive-by.

162
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:40,759
- You know shit about Cell Block 4.
- No. That's not true.

163
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,378
- I know you guys are...
- You got lots of tape?

164
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,266
Good.

165
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:48,517
Cos I'm gonna
let you in on something.

166
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:51,302
OK, fine.
But keep it tight. I do the narrations.

167
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:54,098
All my life
I wanted to be a rapper.

168
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,274
About four years ago...

169
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,914
# Four or five niggaz in a mothership

170
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,127
# Better known as a goose
And we all wanna smother shit

171
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,626
# Bent, front and back glass got tint

172
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,593
# Tryin' to get our hands
on some dollars and cents...

173
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,054
- Turn that music down!
- Come on, Pops.

174
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:22,634
- I already got it on one.
- Put it on negative one.

175
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:25,937
Make us both happy and turn it off.

176
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:29,648
I like this music. I like what
it's about. I like the way it sounds.

177
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:33,194
Albie, I don't understand
this gangster-rap attitude

178
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:35,281
you're so fascinated with.

179
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:38,327
Why don't we listen to Lenny Kravitz?

180
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:41,538
It's just music. You act
as if I was plannin' a drive-by.

181
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:45,664
I'm gonna drive by and whip your ass
if you don't turn that music down.

182
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,252
Why ain't you in school?
How come you home?

183
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:51,716
- It's Saturday, Pops.
- So, go look at a school.

184
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:54,134
Don't waste electricity
on that rap mess.

185
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:57,349
- But Pop!
- Don't "but" me.

186
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,930
I'll beat your ass in front of
your woman. No rap in my house.

187
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,397
In our day, they sang.
That rap ain't nothin' but talkin'.

188
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:08,275
It won't never last!
Remember black-and-white TV? Gone!

189
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:11,656
Remember eight-tracks? Gone!
Betamax? Gone.

190
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:16,077
- Look, Wackee Dee and Sun Shine.
- Oh, no!

191
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:23,704
Albertina, Alberta!
Come on in here now.

192
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:27,376
- Look.
- Ooh, that boy sure can dance.

193
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:30,756
# 'Cause I'm the wackiest,
there's no question, I can dance

194
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:32,765
# Dance in my pants and in your face

195
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:35,016
Come on, dance with me, baby.

196
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,603
# But I can dance
I got sun, I got shine

197
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,312
# Move back hard core
'cause I'm goin' for mine

198
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:42,483
# Did I mention before that I can dance

199
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,856
- # I'm Wackee Dee
- # Wackee Dee's in the house

200
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,986
- # Wack-Wackee Dee
- # Wackee Dee's in the house

201
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,948
# Wackee Dee's in the house

202
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,080
- # Let's rock and roll
- # Wackee Dee's in the house

203
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,294
- # I'm Wackee Dee
- # Wackee Dee's in the house...

204
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:08,257
As you can see, my loved ones
really respected my musical taste.

205
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:12,639
Was Stab Master Arson
also middle class?

206
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:17,397
Well, Otis came from
a different environment altogether.

207
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:22,325
Come on in, Albert.
We're just finishing dinner.

208
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,024
I knew I should've came earlier.
How are you?

209
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:28,828
- OK.
- Look, it's Albert! Hi, Albert!

210
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,995
What's up, Tashana,

211
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:36,257
Tawana, Tamika, Talona and Tee Tee?

212
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,419
Hi, Albert.

213
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:41,760
- What's up, O?
- What up, bro?

214
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:46,511
- How long is Otis gonna be out?
- 'Bout 11.00.

215
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:50,263
- He gotta help me with my homework.
- And relax my hair.

216
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:54,563
- And play me in Nintendo.
- And sew me a new dress.

217
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:57,906
- And program my computer.
- Check this out.

218
00:14:58,117 --> 00:15:00,156
Get outta here.
We got stuff to do.

219
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:05,116
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Otis!

220
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,499
Leave my sisters alone.

221
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,331
Otis, you are the man of the house.

222
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,590
I gotta be, with all those sisters.

223
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:18,504
Don't worry. Tonight we're gonna have
crazy fun! Let's pick up Rip.

224
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:19,887
Rip is sick.

225
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,136
- You see the new En Vogue video?
- Cindy is fine!

226
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:26,640
Cindy's fine but she's not the one.
Teri's the one.

227
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:31,477
- Then Cindy's the other one, man.
- She got them eyes!

228
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,367
I wanna suck her like a neck bone.

229
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,324
I wanna suck this like a neck bone.

230
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,539
Correction. I wanna suck her
like a smoked neck bone.

231
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:49,967
Euripides Smalls
was Dead Mike's real name.

232
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:54,222
Rip came from a broken home which meant
he hustled for every dollar he made.

233
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:56,472
Ooh, a hustler.

234
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:18,084
A job's a job, a cheque's a cheque.

235
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:21,830
OK, call again. Thank you.

236
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,669
Hello, 976-FART. You fart, we smell it.

237
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,637
I feel so slippery.

238
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:31,136
976-SEXY

239
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:34,221
- Yo, I wanna...
- Man, let's get out of here.

240
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:36,809
Here it comes.

241
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:41,023
Ooh, yeah! Here it comes.

242
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:45,187
Yeah, give it to me,
baby. Come on, give it all to me, baby.

243
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:48,493
- Yeah, baby!
- Yeah, baby. Here it comes.

244
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:52,203
Fuck you! Kiss my ass, motherfucker.
Kiss my fuckin' ass.

245
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,909
Thank you. Call again.

246
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,664
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I might find Euripides Smalls?

247
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:00,674
- Right down there.
- Thanks a lot.

248
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:03,090
976-DISS.

249
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:06,383
You're so soft and tender.
I love it when you call.

250
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,387
It's lovely.
All right, till tomorrow.

251
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:11,642
- What's up, kid?
- You almost ready?

252
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:13,931
Yo, this job is nasty!

253
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,195
Yeah, I'm lickin' your balls.

254
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:28,578
Best balls I ever had.
You got King Kong balls.

255
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:35,589
Your balls is so large...
Just big balls, I don't care.

256
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:42,970
Peace! I hate this job.
This ain't no job for no black man!

257
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:45,639
Yo, let's go down
to Gusto's, all right?

258
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:47,977
We got some problems to lick.

259
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:53,316
If you ask me,
George Jefferson was a sell-out.

260
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,148
He thought success
was livin' in a white man's buildin'

261
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,321
and disrespectin'
his African-American employees.

262
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:04,487
No, you don't understand.
The cool thing about George Jefferson

263
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:08,577
was he hated every white person he met,
unless they had a cheque for him.

264
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,418
Tom Willis come over,
the door slammed in his face.

265
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:15,714
But soon as somebody had a cheque for
him, "Hey, Weezie, fix him up a plate."

266
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,636
- Ain't I right, Otis?
- Yeah, right and tight.

267
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,926
That's a real role model to me.

268
00:18:21,144 --> 00:18:23,636
- Do you got the tape?
- Yeah, but I'm Run.

269
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:26,098
- I'm DMC.
- Why can't I be DMC?

270
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:29,568
- Cos you Jam Master Jay.
- I'm always Jam Master.

271
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,899
Me and you will do DMC together,
is that all right with you?

272
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:34,113
- All right.
- Cool.

273
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:45,381
# I'm the king of rock
There is none higher

274
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:47,666
# Sucker MCs should call me sire

275
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,292
# To float in my kingdom
you must use fire

276
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:52,422
# I won't stop rockin' till I retire

277
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,929
# Now we rocked all 20 and come correct

278
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,300
# All cuts are on time
and rhymes connect

279
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,596
# Got the right to vote and we'll elect

280
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:02,352
# And other rappers can't stand us
but give us respect

281
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:18,210
- # They call us hip
- # We're gettin' 'nilla

282
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,415
- # They don't
- # Want chilla

283
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,002
# It's not Michael Jackson
and this is not Thriller

284
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:33,852
# You can't touch me
with a ten-foot pole

285
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:36,814
# And I even make the devil
sell me his soul, soul, soul...

286
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:40,061
- Fix that tape, man!
- I'm sorry.

287
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,437
We was jamming, man.

288
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:45,194
- We was jamming!
- Damn!

289
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,737
Now, we were already a rap group,
but we had no direction.

290
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:54,659
- Every week we'd go down to Gusto's...
- No. Excuse me.

291
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:59,126
Now you've got me completely scrambled
up here. I thought you were Gusto.

292
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:02,047
Chill. You'll understand
everything in a minute.

293
00:20:03,723 --> 00:20:06,926
Every week we go to Gusto's
and check out open mic nights.

294
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:11,271
It was all right.
First we were the Mad Bohemians.

295
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,438
# We're The Bohemians
and you gotta put us on

296
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:15,061
# We're The Bohemians...

297
00:20:15,277 --> 00:20:17,898
Then we did a thing
called The Bag Heads.

298
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:20,902
# The Bag Head, The Bag Heads
The Bag Heads...

299
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:23,787
Then we did a thing called
The Overweight Lovers.

300
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:26,368
# We're fat, we're fat
We're fat, we're fat...

301
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,248
You know, I look back
at that time as sort of paying dues.

302
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:36,130
We met people at Gusto's
who would forever change our lives.

303
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:41,599
Brothers, my name is Baa Baa Ack.

304
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:46,139
I carry the message to the black man
with me wherever I go.

305
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:49,142
I got my message right here, black man.

306
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:51,517
We don't need that back-to-Egypt shit.

307
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:56,980
But between these pages lies the key
to the salvation of the race.

308
00:20:57,201 --> 00:21:02,279
Me myself, I am building a boat to carry
the sun people back to Africa.

309
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,042
If you get with the programme,
you can get on the boat.

310
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:09,921
You should stop by for additional
spiritual instruction.

311
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:13,132
Thanks, brother. I'll do that, man.

312
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:19,301
My proud black warrior,
the book costs $14.95 plus sales tax.

313
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,352
Come on, brother! How come this
black power shit costs so much money?

314
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:26,182
The revolution must be marketed.

315
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,731
You're wastin' good money.

316
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:33,115
I'm investing in my spirituality.
You need to do the same.

317
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:35,996
The only thing I need
to invest in is getting paid.

318
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:42,752
Shit!

319
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,505
What's up, sweetness?

320
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:48,924
Hi. I'm Sissy.

321
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:50,466
S-S-S-S...

322
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,794
The one and only.

323
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:54,685
I done heard your name
on the lips of many rappers.

324
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,301
That's how I like it.

325
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:01,650
- Like what?
- Me on a lot of rappers' lips.

326
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,442
I'm a businessman,
and this is a business.

327
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,199
Hey, Trust us.

328
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:11,821
Trust us! When you gonna let us book
Wackee Dee and Sun Shine in this joint?

329
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,364
We got the hottest spot in all Locash.

330
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,083
I have to admit
this is a wonderful place.

331
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:23,089
But what you've got to remember
is Wackee Dee is more than a rapper.

332
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,792
Wackee Dee is an entertainer.
Right, baby?

333
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:30,426
Looky here, man. I plan on givin'
a big party in this place tomorrow.

334
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:34,101
You understand?
And Wackee Dee is gonna be in the house.

335
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:37,730
Give me a call tomorrow.
We can talk about it.

336
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:43,028
Punk! All these record company punks
is a bunch of bitches.

337
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,237
Bitches.

338
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:48,573
Damn!

339
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,618
I got my own personal photo gallery
of friends that I've met along the way.

340
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:54,832
Oh, yeah?

341
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:58,250
- Would you like to see?
- You know it.

342
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:06,389
I like to photograph my friends
in a position to please.

343
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,394
Vanilla Spice.

344
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,269
If you know what I'm sayin'.

345
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:21,109
Get large, and maybe I'll let you
take a picture with me too.

346
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,197
Maybe.

347
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,206
Goddamn!

348
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:32,119
- What you lookin' at, punk?
- Nothin'. I'm sorry.

349
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:38,128
- What's your name, bitch?
- Albert. Albert Brown.

350
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,519
Gusto, I just wanna say thanks a lot
for letting us perform here.

351
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:45,805
I really appreciate it.

352
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:48,393
Yeah, baby.

353
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:50,602
I gots to get up in that.

354
00:23:55,366 --> 00:24:00,610
Silly-ass bitch. She only go out with
rappers, entertainers, shit like that.

355
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,323
She don't know
where to get the real big dick.

356
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,706
Big dick.

357
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,046
Excuse me, Gusto. If Wackee Dee plays
here, could we be the opening act?

358
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,467
- You dismissed.
- Come on, man.

359
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,930
- We're gettin' our shit together...
- When I say "go" you go.

360
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,301
Yo, what's going on?
What's up, man?

361
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:22,934
What, your posse
'spose to be deep now?

362
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:28,104
Brother, you seem easily upset.

363
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,576
Damn!

364
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:42,252
- Shit.
- I should fuck you up!

365
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:43,745
Damn.

366
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:49,972
You better have some cash.

367
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,090
Come on, look.

368
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:56,976
Fellas, come here! Let me talk to you.

369
00:24:57,188 --> 00:25:01,650
Look, you guys can rap,
but you got nothin' I can sell.

370
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,352
If you get it together, give me a call.

371
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,492
- Where were we?
- What's up, baby?

372
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:11,704
You know who that was?
That was Trust us Jones!

373
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:14,487
Trust us Jones,
the motherfuckin' mogul of rap!

374
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,912
That's fine. Maybe in the future,
we can tap that resource.

375
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:20,372
Right now we got
a very serious problem.

376
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:25,052
Gusto's is the only place in Locash that
showcases rap. We need to get back in.

377
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:28,929
You gotta take your Slim-Fast ass
back in there and apologise.

378
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:31,301
- I don't wanna go in there.
- C'mon, man.

379
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,430
Now, man. C'mon.

380
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:38,774
Bitch!

381
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,156
Tomorrow. Tomorrow, all right?

382
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:48,913
"Now, listen, motherfucker.
I'm runnin' shit."

383
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:50,405
Nope. He'll kill me.

384
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:53,912
"Gusto, you need us, baby."
Nope. He'll slap me.

385
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,831
"Check this out. I'm here to kiss
your ass. Show me where to pucker up."

386
00:25:58,052 --> 00:25:59,083
He's gonna kill me.

387
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:03,349
Hope this shit is better than last time.
My name's attached to this shit.

388
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:06,177
- It's good.
- Yeah, it's good.

389
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:10,095
40 Dog, get on the door.
Show him the cash.

390
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:16,102
That's enough for five birds.
Let's see 'em.

391
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:26,452
- Hey, you got the time?
- Sure, 3.00.

392
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,268
- No!
- Who the fuck is that?

393
00:26:49,486 --> 00:26:52,772
- Don't worry. That kid, Albert.
- What the fuck does he want?

394
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,445
Probably just wanna kiss your ass!

395
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,496
He is an ass-kissin' motherfucker.
It's cool.

396
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:00,790
Ass-kickin' motherfucker!

397
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:07,828
Hi, Mr 40 Dog.

398
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,754
I was just wonderin'
if Gusto were around.

399
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:15,881
Remember where it comes from,
who gets that kind of cash in Locash.

400
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,435
- Gusto, how's it go?
- Freeze! Get down now!

401
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:22,434
Freeze! Get down! Freeze!

402
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:25,108
You too!

403
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:30,155
- Well, happy birthday, Gusto.
- My birthday was last week.

404
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,776
I wanted you to have
something to celebrate.

405
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:35,665
- Fake-ass Bruce Willis.
- You can let him go.

406
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:38,745
- He's OK.
- You set me up?

407
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:43,210
- You set me up?
- I saw him talking to the cops.

408
00:27:43,424 --> 00:27:46,460
You dead, bitch. Better buy
a black dress for your mama.

409
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:50,094
- Cell Block 4 is waiting.
- Ain't nothin' but brick and steel.

410
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:52,888
That can't hold Gusto.
That can't hold Gusto!

411
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:55,718
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

412
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:01,477
Stay back!

413
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,328
Let's go. Bring him out here.

414
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,033
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

415
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,430
I'm gonna get you, punk.

416
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,590
Think it's over?
You embarrassed me like this?

417
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,019
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

418
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,146
Now, Gusto was no Nino Brown,
but he was large in Locash.

419
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:40,110
When I heard them chant his name,
I figured he won't need it anytime soon.

420
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:44,868
- Brother, I don't know, man.
- Listen to me.

421
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:49,658
We take Gusto's image,
make ourselves into hard-core rappers.

422
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:52,285
Then we take stories from Gusto's life.

423
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:55,458
- Get Trust us Jones to handle us.
- I ain't with it.

424
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:59,126
- I'm the only one taking a real risk.
- How's that?

425
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:02,762
Cos from now on
I'll be known as MC Gusto.

426
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:07,184
We'll be Cell Block 4,
after the joint they threw Gusto in.

427
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:10,848
You buggin'? You couldn't
pick a name besides that nigga Gusto?

428
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:14,111
"Nigga"? You already
becomin' a gangster!

429
00:29:14,322 --> 00:29:17,607
No, cousin, I can't let you go
out like that. I'm not havin' it.

430
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:21,658
- I say we vote on it, and I vote yes.
- I vote no three times.

431
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:24,363
You only get one vote.
Otis, how you feel?

432
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:27,418
Otis, you and I both
know it's suicide, man.

433
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:32,540
Otis, what about Sissy?
Think about Sissy.

434
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,425
I know you want to get in there. Sissy.

435
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:41,224
That's it.
Assume the position, baby.

436
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:43,259
I vote yes.

437
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:48,144
- I wouldn't mind being large a minute.
- What you gonna do?

438
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,363
It's crazy, crazy shit!

439
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:56,283
Yo, listen. Excuse me, man.
Do you work in radio?

440
00:29:56,496 --> 00:30:00,577
- No, nigga.
- Wait a minute. An answering service?

441
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:02,832
No, nigga.
Eat your big-ass biscuit.

442
00:30:03,045 --> 00:30:06,711
Hey, it don't have to be about all that.
It's your speaking voice.

443
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:09,001
It's so... familiar.

444
00:30:11,597 --> 00:30:15,546
- Yeah.
- You brothers is all I got. I'm in!

445
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:19,351
But I gotta tell you, if I get
something better to do, I'm steppin'.

446
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:24,476
Nigga, please! We're gonna be so large,
make so much money, get so many girlies.

447
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:27,483
By the time Gusto gets out of jail,
we'll be so large,

448
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:30,616
we'll write him a cheque
and tell him to chill.

449
00:30:30,826 --> 00:30:32,571
We can't be so exploitive, now.

450
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:35,409
- No question!
- Cousin!

451
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,667
# What I look like
What I act like

452
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,921
# What I look like
What I dress like

453
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:45,042
# What I look like
What I act like

454
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,179
- # What I look like, what I dress like
- Look at that fake motherfucker.

455
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,670
# Wanna, wanna be worse

456
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:52,097
# Fucker bait king
Then they make us all birds

457
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,936
# Pass act give half-lip back

458
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:55,932
# Fool ain't never seen a Jack

459
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,354
# Cos what I'm from
the real niggaz don't play

460
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:00,644
# Ain't no way to become OG in a day

461
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:02,522
# You gotta put in time
You gotta put in work

462
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:05,195
# Can't be like that just
Just cos of khaki's and a T-shirt

463
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,574
- # What I look like, what I act like...
- Next!

464
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:09,198
#... what I dress like

465
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:11,157
# What I look like
What I act like...

466
00:31:11,374 --> 00:31:13,331
OK, guys, I love the image.

467
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:15,786
But let me ask you one thing.

468
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:20,879
Are you sure you wanna be Gusto? Why not
something like Ice Pick, Ice Coffee?

469
00:31:21,095 --> 00:31:23,419
- "Ice" is happening now.
- "Ice" my dick.

470
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:25,383
We're Cell Block 4
and I'm Gusto.

471
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,099
- Take it or leave it.
- All right, guys. Let's get started.

472
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:34,690
So I want you to sign with us
and you want to sign with us.

473
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:40,273
We want you to want to sign with us.
Let me ask you a couple of questions.

474
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:43,161
- Do you cuss on your records?
- Yeah.

475
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,786
- Do you defile women with your lyrics?
- Yeah.

476
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,000
Do you...

477
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:53,163
...fondle your genitalia on stage?

478
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:55,172
- Yeah.
- Whenever possible.

479
00:31:57,512 --> 00:32:01,592
Do you glorify violence
or advocate the use of guns

480
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,809
as a way of solving a civil dispute?
OK, final question.

481
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,894
Do you respect anything at all?

482
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:08,849
Not a goddamn thing.

483
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:12,944
You've got a deal!
Welcome to the family.

484
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:14,733
Trust us Productions!

485
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:17,898
Trust us. You can't trust me,
you can't Trust us.

486
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,823
I love, I love it!
Gold, gold, gold!

487
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:24,536
# Straight outta Locash
A crazy motherfucker named Gusto

488
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:26,827
# I fucked your wife
Cos the bitch is a big ho

489
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,122
# I fucked your sister,
I fucked your cat

490
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,297
# I would've fucked your mom
but the bitch is too fat

491
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,466
# When I'm in your neighbourhood
you better dig a moat

492
00:32:33,678 --> 00:32:35,885
# Cos I'm coming to slit
your motherfuckin' throat

493
00:32:36,098 --> 00:32:38,339
# Blood is drippin'
I'm not slippin'

494
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,599
# Bitches' panties is what I'm rippin'

495
00:32:40,812 --> 00:32:43,018
# Rollin’ faster than
a motherfuckin' dirt bike

496
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:45,391
# Never met a piece of pussy
that I didn't like

497
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,361
# Like to eat it, like to suck it
Take a shit in a bucket

498
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:52,235
# Straight outta Locash
Uh, crazy motherfuckers

499
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:57,575
# Yeah

500
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,785
# Where you from, nigga?

501
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:02,085
# Straight outta Locash
A crazy motherfucker named Dead Mike

502
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:04,122
# Get ready cos you goin'
for a long hike

503
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:06,665
# Off a cliff
I'm drivin' you over

504
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,007
# Now you're there
wit' your four-leaf clover

505
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:11,378
# Float like a cannonball
Sting like a shark

506
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:13,389
# I'm the nigga waitin' for you
in the dark

507
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,556
# Waitin' to rob you
Waitin' to beat you

508
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:17,928
# A bullet in the head
is how I'll reach you

509
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:20,305
# You're dealin' with the hat
and it's like that

510
00:33:20,524 --> 00:33:22,601
# I tied your mother
to a motherfuckin' train track...

511
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:26,437
Cut! OK. Great.
Let's set up the next scene.

512
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:28,614
Everybody can take a break.

513
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:33,282
All right, dude!

514
00:33:34,624 --> 00:33:38,575
God, I just love that "I don't give
a damn" hip-hop attitude. It's so real.

515
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:47,927
- Hey, excuse me.
- What's up, baby? How can I help you?

516
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:52,434
I know you were hooked into the prison
seeing that you're from Cell Block 4.

517
00:33:52,645 --> 00:33:54,804
Yeah, I was runnin' shit up at CB4.

518
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:59,437
I had a brother up at Folsom. He was
smoked by The Black Guerrilla Family.

519
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:02,571
I'm sorry to hear that.

520
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:06,069
You gotta help me get revenge.
They killed him on the toilet.

521
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:09,988
They could've wiped his ass.
They didn't have to leave him like that!

522
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:14,159
That's cold-blooded. They gots to pay.
They got to pay!

523
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,621
They gots to pay.

524
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:24,047
I read that part of it.

525
00:34:25,476 --> 00:34:27,966
Man, what's he doin' here?

526
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:31,971
I would appreciate you givin' brother
Baa Baa Ack the respect due him.

527
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:36,688
- He is givin' me spiritual instruction.
- You mean tax deduction.

528
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:40,155
- Listen here, Albert!
- Don't call me Albert!

529
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:43,286
- It's Gusto, got it?
- That's exactly my point.

530
00:34:43,496 --> 00:34:48,040
None of this is real, so we got
to stay grounded in reality.

531
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:52,754
Nigga, please! Baa Baa Black Sheep is
about as fake as a bitch's hair weave.

532
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,550
There they are. Dead Mike, MC Gusto!

533
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,838
This is Eve Edwards of Source Magazine.

534
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:04,138
- She's here to do a piece on the group.
- You're here to give the group a piece?

535
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:07,854
- I gots to go first.
- Why you disrespect this sister?

536
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,608
She just a groupie with a pen.

537
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:12,357
A pen is all you have in
your pants, it's out of ink.

538
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:14,363
- Watch it, ho!
- Ho?

539
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:18,323
This is not Christmas,
you slender slice of sexist slime,

540
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:22,534
and I am not a girlie, a videho,
a skeezer, a prop, a hoochie or a stunt.

541
00:35:22,749 --> 00:35:25,871
And most certainly not a ho. Comprende?

542
00:35:26,463 --> 00:35:28,421
Princess is no joke!

543
00:35:28,632 --> 00:35:32,250
- Thank you, Euripides.
- It's my pleasure, sister Edwards.

544
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:35,222
No, please, call me Eve.

545
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:38,137
- You know...
- I am not a groupie.

546
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:41,721
I am a journalist.
I take no shorts and I do my research.

547
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:45,938
I can do a nice puffy feature
that reports exactly what you tell me,

548
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:50,816
or I can delve so deeply
into your background

549
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:53,654
with an eye for every inconsistency,

550
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:57,535
your mother would disavow
any knowledge of your birth.

551
00:35:57,749 --> 00:36:03,255
Now, which would you prefer, Albert?

552
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:10,348
I love you.

553
00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:13,806
My ass was behind MC Hammer's head
in U Can't Touch This.

554
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:16,890
- You can't touch this
- Who'd want to touch that?

555
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:21,898
My left breast was prominently
featured in Eric B's last video.

556
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:24,318
This video exposure is too come-and-go.

557
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,698
What you need to do
is get yourself a Polaroid Instamatic.

558
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:30,782
You see this watch?

559
00:36:30,996 --> 00:36:33,666
This is what the right picture
of the right man

560
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,081
doin' the wrong thing can get you.

561
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,248
And on that note,
we gotta go, gotta go.

562
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,671
Yeah, we work for a livin'.

563
00:36:41,884 --> 00:36:44,458
You gonna keep workin',
the rate you goin'.

564
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:49,674
It's fine and dandy to go out with these
guys and to drive around in their car,

565
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:52,598
and have them take you
to an expensive restaurant.

566
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:56,977
But if all you get out of it
is a fuck, then you's a ho.

567
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:02,860
But you get yourself
a fabulous motor vehicle,

568
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:07,489
a fine house and can afford
to pay for your own meals,

569
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:10,328
then you are a businesswoman.

570
00:37:11,544 --> 00:37:15,376
Run your black ass back to the
projects and get your government cheque.

571
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:21,178
Take that monkey-ass, Shaka Zulu-lookin'
bitch with you, you hip-hop hos.

572
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:30,687
- You look a little lost, darlin'.
- I guess I am lost.

573
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:33,390
I'm looking for Albert, Albert Brown.

574
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,185
- Who?
- I mean MC Gusto.

575
00:37:36,406 --> 00:37:38,232
Oh, you're here for him?

576
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:41,411
Yeah, he's kinda cute.

577
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:45,410
Not enough man meat on him for me.

578
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:50,003
I hurt small guys like that.
Small men drown in my shit.

579
00:37:51,256 --> 00:37:53,748
Look, honey, I hope you get your man.

580
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:58,132
Or get you some sense and
leave them small men alone.

581
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:03,137
What's happenin'?

582
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:09,734
Comin' through.

583
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:14,533
Straight Outta Locash
made us large

584
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:17,697
and I knew what we were
doin' wasn't totally right,

585
00:38:17,913 --> 00:38:20,154
but it was definitely time to get paid.

586
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:32,470
# Yo, Rakim, what's up?

587
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,302
# Yo, I'm doin' the knowledge, E
Tryin' to get paid in full

588
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:38,553
# Check this out, since Nobry Walters
is our agency, right?

589
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,059
- # And Kara Lewis is our agent
- # Word up

590
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:43,562
# Zakia/4th & Broadway
is our record company

591
00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:45,982
- # Indeed
- # So who we rollin' with then?

592
00:38:46,195 --> 00:38:48,733
- # We rollin' with Rush
- # Of Rushtown Management

593
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:52,448
# Check this out, since we talkin' over
this def beat I put together

594
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,117
# I wanna hear some of those def rhymes,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

595
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,739
# And together
we can get paid in full...

596
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:02,289
Hey. Welcome to
Weird Warren's V-V-V... Video Countdown.

597
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:05,080
Homeboys, home girls,
ain't no need to be lax

598
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,424
cos you got
Weird Warren workin' wax.

599
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,971
Of course, CD stacks and video tracks.

600
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:15,513
CB4 is one of the hottest hip-hop groups
to hit the scene in a long time.

601
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,098
They come not out of Compton,
not out of Oaktown,

602
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:22,023
but out of a small town called Locash.

603
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:25,987
If you're in Sacramento,
they roll into your town next week.

604
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:29,486
Now, let's bust
Straight Outta Locash with CB4

605
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:33,204
on Weird Warren's V-V-V-V...
Video Countdown.

606
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,707
# Check this shit out!

607
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,379
- # Yo, Gusto.
- # What's up?

608
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:38,620
# Kick that shit.

609
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,675
# Straight outta Locash
A crazy motherfucker named Gusto

610
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:43,879
# I'll fuck your wife
Cos the bitch is a big ho

611
00:39:44,096 --> 00:39:45,839
# I'll fuck your sister
I'll fuck your cat

612
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:48,513
# I woulda fucked your mom
but the bitch is too fat

613
00:39:48,726 --> 00:39:50,885
# When I'm in your neighbourhood
You better dig a moat

614
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:53,097
# Cos I'm comin' to slit
your motherfuckin' throat

615
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:55,107
# Blood is dripping...

616
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:56,349
Hey, Dad, CB4!

617
00:39:57,654 --> 00:40:00,228
Billings, I've got
all this paper in front of me.

618
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:02,737
Charts, graphs, the works.

619
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:06,155
What's the bottom line?
Am I gonna win?

620
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,449
Of course you're gonna win!

621
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,703
But your only hope is to
create some kind of media event.

622
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,625
- Daddy!
- A media event? What do you mean?

623
00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:20,380
Dad! Daddy! Hello! This is CB4.

624
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:23,467
Ben! It's just my kid.
Go ahead.

625
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,764
Stop playin' me like a sucker.

626
00:40:28,981 --> 00:40:31,769
I want my CB4, you hear me?

627
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:33,527
# Cos you're goin'on a long hike

628
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:35,611
# Off a cliff, I'm drivin’ you over

629
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:37,899
# Now you're there
wit’ your four-leaf clover

630
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:40,241
# Float like a cannonball
Sting like a shark

631
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:42,577
# I'm the nigga waitin’ for you
in the dark

632
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,947
# Waitin' to rob you
Waitin' to beat you

633
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,959
# A bullet in the head
is how I'll greet you

634
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,292
# Flat on her back
I gave her some crack

635
00:40:49,505 --> 00:40:51,131
# It's ten o'clock
Do you know where your momma's at?

636
00:40:51,342 --> 00:40:53,499
I might have something.

637
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,632
# Straight outta Locash

638
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:03,513
Yo, this is MC Gusto of Cell Block 4.

639
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:06,685
Tonight we're performing
at the Jackson Theatre.

640
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:08,141
Those motherfuckers!

641
00:41:13,491 --> 00:41:17,360
Look at this punk! He's walkin'
like me. He's tryin' to be me!

642
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,743
I didn't know you do rap records, Gusto!
That's bad, man.

643
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:25,496
That ain't him.
Stop bein' ignorant.

644
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:30,676
Bust a little rhyme for me, man.
Come on! Go, go!

645
00:41:30,886 --> 00:41:35,134
Look, man, there's only one Gusto
and he ain't no rapper!

646
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:48,030
That was a brand-new single
from Cell Block 4,

647
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,692
CB4 for those who know,
from their album Straight Outta Locash.

648
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:57,251
Why don't you holler at my
WWWW listeners? Give 'em a holler.

649
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:59,832
Yo, what's up to the hard core?

650
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:05,003
Peace to all the Nubians filled
with the new black consciousness.

651
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:09,003
Yeah, the darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

652
00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:12,011
I'm lovin' this.
Why don't we go to the phone lines,

653
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:16,142
talk to some brothers, let them
get to know you straight up in person?

654
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:18,314
We got Susan from Gardena.

655
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:20,567
Why don't you holler at CB4?

656
00:42:20,778 --> 00:42:23,234
This question's for Dead Mike.

657
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:26,319
I was reading Right On.
Your birthday's comin' up.

658
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:29,205
I was wondering,
what's your favourite dessert?

659
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,950
Sister, my sister.

660
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:37,249
It is uplifting to know
that a sister such as yourself

661
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:39,920
still takes pride in her race.

662
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:44,180
It's ice cream. Did you know
a black man invented ice cream?

663
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:50,061
No, no! How the hell a black man gonna
invent ice cream in hot-ass Africa?

664
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:52,763
- Tell me that.
- Ice cream, Africa.

665
00:42:52,983 --> 00:42:56,102
That's a great concept, guys.
I'm liking that. Next call.

666
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,107
OK, I got a question
for this so-called Gusto.

667
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:02,408
If you set someone up
for the police then stole his name,

668
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,197
didn't even say "excuse me",

669
00:43:04,412 --> 00:43:08,281
wouldn't you expect the injured party
to bust out of jail, hunt you down

670
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:11,372
- and beat you like the dog you are?
- Nah!

671
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:15,167
The chickens have come home to roost.

672
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,387
Open C block, comin' up.

673
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,301
- Hey, baby.
- Single file, girls.

674
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:28,641
Walk.

675
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:30,685
Girls.

676
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,481
What are you doin'?

677
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:36,775
I'm gettin' us outta here. Be quiet!

678
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:50,831
- I'm in this one.
- You gonna have to go!

679
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:53,842
Get in there.

680
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:09,059
Man, you crazy with that
"I don't eat pork" shit.

681
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,400
Personally, I'll eat a pig's ass
if they cook it right.

682
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:15,701
Beloved, it's against
everything I now believe.

683
00:44:15,912 --> 00:44:19,281
You see, pork is the white man,

684
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:22,122
and the white man is pork.

685
00:44:22,337 --> 00:44:26,251
If you spell "white man" backwards
what does it spell? Pork!

686
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,878
If you can't see that,
they've got you brainwashed, brother.

687
00:44:31,097 --> 00:44:34,513
I must be brainwashed then.
You mean to tell me

688
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:39,021
if you was thrown outta your apartment
and a pig offered to pay your rent,

689
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:41,224
- you wouldn't take the money?
- No.

690
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:44,858
Shit. I'd be
a-money takin' from a pig.

691
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:47,563
That's the difference
between you and me.

692
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:49,942
I got a place
and you live with your mother.

693
00:44:58,044 --> 00:45:01,082
Would you stop it? Albert!

694
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:04,170
- Just a sip.
- I'm gonna smack you.

695
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:07,337
Shit. More for me then.

696
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,344
Albert, I don't like this scene.

697
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,229
I definitely don't like
what's happening to you.

698
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:19,315
Just because I got a little bit of cash,
why does everybody gotta start buggin'?

699
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:22,198
No, no. We are not bugging.

700
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:26,322
It's you who better take a look
in the mirror, Mr MC Gusto.

701
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:31,158
You are not the sensitive man
you used to be.

702
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:34,246
# I'm in love...

703
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:38,004
Daliha!

704
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:49,014
Give it to me! Albert!

705
00:45:49,855 --> 00:45:52,063
That girl is too wholesome.

706
00:45:52,274 --> 00:45:54,314
She's messin' with our program.

707
00:45:54,527 --> 00:45:59,237
Sissy, I want you to get in as many
pictures as possible with MC Gusto,

708
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,691
kissin' him, huggin' him, whatever.

709
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,031
- I planned on doin' that anyway.
- No, no, baby,

710
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:07,705
I mean, with a
professional photographer.

711
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:12,165
You should be what
Cell Block 4's all about.

712
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:15,837
If I could just add
a personal note at this point.

713
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:19,220
This was the year
when I first discovered CB4.

714
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:23,975
Well, you three have been
inside my head ever since.

715
00:46:24,187 --> 00:46:27,472
- That's my personal thank you.
- You're very welcome.

716
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,017
I only wish everyone
felt that way.

717
00:46:31,987 --> 00:46:37,279
The home is the most important
institution in American life.

718
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:41,445
It's our castle in a world
of demons and dragons.

719
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:46,127
Since the mysterious
death of my wife,

720
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:49,707
my son Ben and I had
bonded together in our home.

721
00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:53,259
I say "had"
because through rap music,

722
00:46:53,471 --> 00:46:56,923
evil influences invaded our castle,

723
00:46:57,142 --> 00:47:02,481
representatives of a demon culture
that must be stopped at all costs!

724
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:07,726
Any person who'd
defile America's pastime

725
00:47:07,946 --> 00:47:11,150
by wearing a baseball cap backwards,

726
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:13,988
well, that's an evil
that speaks for itself.

727
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:29,294
See! See how those demons
have poisoned my seed!

728
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:31,589
Ben! Ben!

729
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,383
Ben!

730
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,060
Ben! Come here, son!

731
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:44,522
To some people, these fools
out here could be a problem.

732
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:46,696
Bad for the image,
bad for sales.

733
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:52,151
But you, brothers,
have created something so nasty,

734
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:55,374
so vile, that the iller you get,
the better off we are.

735
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:59,501
- Now go out there and have a good time.
- No problem.

736
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:02,171
By the way,
I almost forgot to tell you.

737
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:04,009
Gusto escaped from prison.

738
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,221
He has vowed to dismember
everybody in the group.

739
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:08,427
Knock 'em dead.

740
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:13,010
Get back! Get back!

741
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:16,183
Trust us? Trust us, hi.

742
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,771
- Hi, Eve. I love the piece you did.
- You should thank Dead Mike.

743
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:23,025
You aware they might be
arrested for indecency tonight?

744
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:26,576
Cell Block 4 is not afraid to go
to jail. Cell Block 4 is from jail!

745
00:48:26,788 --> 00:48:30,158
It would be like sendin' 'em home!
Sissy? Baby, where are ya?

746
00:48:30,376 --> 00:48:32,285
There you are.

747
00:48:32,754 --> 00:48:35,838
Can I have your autograph?
Yeah, yeah, little kiddie.

748
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:39,085
Stab Master, CB4.

749
00:48:39,302 --> 00:48:41,710
- Keep it as a souvenir.
- Thanks.

750
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,848
- Let's go, baby.
- Come on, Dad. It's only an...

751
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:49,896
Hey, hey, wait. Who is this?

752
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:53,559
- She looks too cute to be your woman.
- Remember what time it is!

753
00:48:53,778 --> 00:48:57,230
- She's my cousin, my cousin.
- What?

754
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:00,275
Are you OK?

755
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,582
Man, look at this funky asshole.

756
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:11,205
That bitch wouldn't give me the time
of day because I wasn't an entertainer,

757
00:49:11,422 --> 00:49:13,297
because I wasn't a star.

758
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:16,629
Don't the bitch know that
we're the motherfuckin' stars?

759
00:49:16,846 --> 00:49:18,840
That's all right.

760
00:49:19,058 --> 00:49:22,177
Because now I'm gonna get
paid off from them. You know how?

761
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:24,601
Pimp 'em like
the bitches that they are.

762
00:49:24,814 --> 00:49:26,474
Pimp them motherfuckin' hos.

763
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,227
With Daliha out of the picture,

764
00:49:30,445 --> 00:49:32,521
I decided to see what Sissy
was all about.

765
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:36,110
The only problem was, so did Dead Mike.

766
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:03,632
Come to big daddy.

767
00:51:30,877 --> 00:51:32,835
I ain't goin' down there.

768
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,086
Shit.

769
00:52:23,689 --> 00:52:25,977
CB4, where you at?

770
00:52:26,191 --> 00:52:27,187
CB4, where you at?

771
00:52:35,077 --> 00:52:37,117
Yo, we livin' crazy large.

772
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:40,248
We got the girls,
we got the money, we got the gold.

773
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:43,791
And we're one spot behind Wackee Dee.
Takin' out all that rap.

774
00:52:44,004 --> 00:52:47,918
- I'm glad you happy, cos I'm not.
- Man, what's your beef?

775
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:52,677
All this gangster mess, man.
People protestin'. That ain't for me.

776
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:55,262
I like the music.
I like the fly-ass girlies.

777
00:52:55,475 --> 00:52:58,145
I also like when I help
my sisters around the house.

778
00:52:58,354 --> 00:53:02,222
One nigga wants to be Malcolm X,
the other wants to be Richie Cunningham.

779
00:53:02,442 --> 00:53:04,648
Yo, the devil's in full effect.

780
00:53:07,115 --> 00:53:10,698
Hey, there's nothin'
to worry about. Trust me.

781
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:17,579
In my role as head of the Sacramento
City Council's Board of Decency,

782
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:21,210
I, Virgil Robinson,
am here to inform you that:

783
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:25,669
"Under penalty of arrest
you cannot touch your genitalia.

784
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:29,385
The word 'ho' can only be used
in reference to a garden tool.

785
00:53:29,598 --> 00:53:33,015
The word 'bitch' may only be used
when describing female dogs,

786
00:53:33,227 --> 00:53:35,267
and then only when in heat.

787
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,398
The word 'blow job' can only
be used in describing a job

788
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:41,979
blowing up balloons
or children's animals."

789
00:53:42,197 --> 00:53:43,477
Do I make myself clear?

790
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:48,907
And under no circumstances,
are you to perform Sweat...

791
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:53,830
... Sweat Of My Balls tonight.

792
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:03,961
CB4, where ya at? CB4, where ya at?

793
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:09,603
CB4, where ya at? CB4, where ya at?

794
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:15,104
CB4, where ya at? CB4, where ya at?

795
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:20,354
On the motherfuckin' stage!

796
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:25,534
CB is here! CB4! Where ya at?

797
00:54:25,747 --> 00:54:28,285
CB4, where ya at?

798
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:34,752
CB4, where ya at, motherfuckers?

799
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:39,633
MC Gusto, Dead Mike,
Stab Master Arson,

800
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:43,430
you all have been sentenced
by the government of the USA

801
00:54:43,643 --> 00:54:49,729
to poverty, ignorance
and imprisonment in Cell Block 4!

802
00:54:58,076 --> 00:55:00,283
Yeah! CB4 is in the motherfuckin' house!

803
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,490
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

804
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:07,754
Say CB4! Say CB4!

805
00:55:07,963 --> 00:55:12,507
Say CB4! Say CB4! Yo, yo!

806
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:14,676
Do that shit, do that shit, do it!

807
00:55:14,887 --> 00:55:19,716
Yeah, yeah, say do that shit,
do that shit, do it!

808
00:55:19,977 --> 00:55:21,851
It goes something like this! Jump!

809
00:55:22,063 --> 00:55:23,937
Jump, jump, jump!

810
00:55:24,148 --> 00:55:25,940
Jump, jump, jump!

811
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:28,274
Jump, jump, jump!

812
00:55:28,487 --> 00:55:30,112
Yo, give me this right now!

813
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:32,149
# For the ladies, 130 pounds of beef

814
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:34,656
# Yeah, Chinky eyes, curly hair
and gold teeth

815
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,992
# Swingin' with this here stud
you need practice

816
00:55:37,205 --> 00:55:39,199
# I'm leavin' used rubbers on a mattress

817
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:43,581
# When I'm with my homies we're rollin'
Can't love a car unless it's stolen

818
00:55:43,797 --> 00:55:47,546
# Don't ask me what the price is
But it's more than pussy-tickle devices

819
00:55:47,759 --> 00:55:50,002
- # You can feel the
- # Sweat from my balls

820
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,048
- # You can feel the
- # Sweat from my balls

821
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,139
- # You can feel the
- # Sweat from my balls

822
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,474
- # You can feel the
- # Sweat from my balls

823
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,142
- # You can feel the
- # Sweat from my balls...

824
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:01,645
What are they doin'?

825
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,104
They're goin' to jail!

826
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:05,811
Didn't anybody tell you
this is a free country!

827
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:07,940
- Get 'em!
- # Sweat from my biggedy-balls...

828
00:56:09,201 --> 00:56:10,577
- Hey!
- What the fuck!

829
00:56:10,786 --> 00:56:13,989
Get the fuck off me, man!
Get the fuck off me.

830
00:56:14,206 --> 00:56:16,331
- Get off me!
- Get 'em outta here!

831
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:20,034
Get off!

832
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,467
Get the fuck off me.

833
00:56:27,472 --> 00:56:31,222
Party over here!
Just wave your hands in the air!

834
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:33,345
And party like you just don't care!

835
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:46,237
Answer me this.

836
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:50,202
How come a rock group can bite
the head off a pigeon, nothin' happen?

837
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:53,951
I'm gettin' ready to go to jail
for a song about the sweat of my balls.

838
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,376
You'll be happy to know,
Mr A White

839
00:56:56,589 --> 00:56:59,426
that Cell Block 4 actually
did spend the night in jail.

840
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,880
You guys CB4?

841
00:57:08,312 --> 00:57:09,510
Watch, check this out.

842
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,806
# Well, my name is Jerry
and I'm here to say

843
00:57:12,024 --> 00:57:14,231
# That the girl look fly
but she don't give me no play #

844
00:57:16,029 --> 00:57:18,068
I'm MC Gusto.

845
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:22,231
But in prison
I'm known as 9-7-dash-K-Y

846
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:26,036
L-M-N-O-P-dash-14
to the third power.

847
00:57:26,249 --> 00:57:29,001
Now, I may be in here
for malicious acts,

848
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,251
I do have a sensitive side.

849
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:34,036
So I'd like to read you
a poem. It's called

850
00:57:34,257 --> 00:57:37,260
- "I didn't do it".
- My man got a poem.

851
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:42,892
"Just because I had the cash
doesn't mean I killed his ass.

852
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:44,644
I didn't do it.

853
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:48,057
Just because
the blood was in my hand

854
00:57:48,274 --> 00:57:50,102
doesn't mean I stabbed the man.

855
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,564
I didn't do it."

856
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:25,060
All right, all right!

857
00:58:25,276 --> 00:58:29,440
Welcome to the post-arrest conference
for the world's most dangerous band,

858
00:58:29,656 --> 00:58:30,687
CB4!

859
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:35,155
- Yeah, they couldn't keep us in!
- All right, first question.

860
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:38,705
My name is Malik from the
Tan City Sun and I'd like to know

861
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:41,206
what you so-called brothers are doing

862
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,090
to uplift the community
in economic terms.

863
00:58:44,299 --> 00:58:47,085
Man, I'm tired of these
black questions, man.

864
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:49,972
Ask Michael J Fox
what he's doin' for the yuppies?

865
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,549
Ask Sylvester Stallone
what he's doin' for the Italians?

866
00:58:53,768 --> 00:58:58,595
Brother, I'd like it to be known that I
am reinvesting in the black community.

867
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:01,354
I am opening a chain
of beeper supply stores

868
00:59:01,694 --> 00:59:06,570
in Locash that will employ only
our disenfranchised black youth.

869
00:59:06,783 --> 00:59:09,738
MC Gusto,
my African-American women readers

870
00:59:09,954 --> 00:59:12,740
would like to know why
you refer to women as bitches.

871
00:59:12,956 --> 00:59:17,703
Yo, women, bitches, hos...
people with pussies.

872
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,748
I love the pussy people.

873
00:59:19,964 --> 00:59:23,132
- Pussy for everybody.
- Yeah, pussies!

874
00:59:23,344 --> 00:59:25,003
- Know what I'm sayin'?
- I do not

875
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,970
and neither would anyone with
respect for the English language.

876
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:30,893
- Next question.
- Excuse me.

877
00:59:31,103 --> 00:59:34,020
In protest of our arrest
by the powers that be,

878
00:59:34,231 --> 00:59:38,016
we will answer no questions
from the white media!

879
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:42,069
- Let's go.
- Press conference over!

880
00:59:50,249 --> 00:59:52,824
Well, that's the story so far.

881
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:56,913
This is just incredible. It's amazing.

882
00:59:57,134 --> 01:00:00,752
Well, to use your words,
it's "all that".

883
01:00:00,971 --> 01:00:04,921
- It's gonna make a great video.
- I wouldn't unload my camera just yet.

884
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,265
I still gotta deal with Gusto.

885
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:14,849
- Later.
- All right.

886
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:20,108
This bitch is really from the ghetto.

887
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:23,031
Don't look like the ghetto to me, boss.

888
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:25,780
"The smallest dog in
the world is the Chihuahua.

889
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,037
It is named for a city in Mexico
where it became popular."

890
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:32,962
Shut up, girl. You just think
you so smart cos you can read.

891
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:35,760
Hey, baby!

892
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:39,423
Give your grandma a big kiss!

893
01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:42,428
- So how you doin', Grandma?
- How you doin'?

894
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:46,892
I heard you just broke out of the joint.
I didn't even know you was in there.

895
01:00:47,108 --> 01:00:48,981
It was just an overnight thing.

896
01:00:49,193 --> 01:00:52,279
Is the conjugal room still green?

897
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:55,696
I wouldn't know about that.
It was just overnight.

898
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,618
Mmm, you oughta know.

899
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:06,462
- Hi, D.
- Hey, Albert. How was jail?

900
01:01:06,672 --> 01:01:11,382
Look, Daliha, that whole
cousin thing, I was wrong.

901
01:01:11,595 --> 01:01:16,803
I would never try
to hurt you, D. I love you.

902
01:01:17,018 --> 01:01:18,642
Look, I got you somethin'.

903
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:35,203
Great. I'm sure that
Sissy girl would love these.

904
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:51,014
Hey, there's a party inside.

905
01:01:52,892 --> 01:01:56,392
Your mother may have
time for a party, but me,

906
01:01:56,605 --> 01:02:00,271
- I got bills to pay.
- Why don't you take this to a carwash?

907
01:02:00,485 --> 01:02:03,059
We don't have money to take
the car to the carwash

908
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,736
every time it gets a little smudge.

909
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:08,322
We ain't all big-time
rap stars like you.

910
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:16,499
Son, what's on your mind?

911
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:19,084
I work to get us
into a nice house like this,

912
01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:21,339
and you pretend to be a crook.

913
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:23,211
- What, you ashamed of me?
- No.

914
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:26,964
Why you go runnin' around
with gold-tooth, greasy-ass hair,

915
01:02:27,183 --> 01:02:31,513
holdin' your Johnson like it's the
only one God created? You ain't tough.

916
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:36,357
There are some real kids out there
who are gonna kick your narrow ass!

917
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:39,238
You ain't from the street.
I'm from the street!

918
01:02:39,446 --> 01:02:43,279
And only somebody who wasn't
would think it was something to glorify!

919
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,121
That's a pretty little thing.

920
01:02:56,299 --> 01:02:58,970
This bitch got all the bitches.

921
01:03:17,365 --> 01:03:20,403
We was just readin'
about you, bitch!

922
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:25,291
You know, your Ready-Rooter, funky-ass
truck-driving father was right.

923
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,705
You ought to be ashamed of
yourself taking advantage of me.

924
01:03:28,922 --> 01:03:30,629
Gusto?

925
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,839
Boy, I'm three generations
deep in gangsterdom.

926
01:03:35,053 --> 01:03:36,762
Three generations!

927
01:03:39,768 --> 01:03:42,009
Albert, are you in there?

928
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:45,482
And your woman?
She's real fine, you know.

929
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:48,016
I'd like to fuck her froggy style.

930
01:03:48,235 --> 01:03:50,987
- What did you say?
- I'll be out in a while.

931
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:52,822
OK.

932
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:58,329
- Tryin' to protect that ass?
- Protect that ass!

933
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:02,205
- Welcome to the terrordome, bitch.
- Terrordome, bitch.

934
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:16,806
What are you gonna do?

935
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:21,013
- You want to be a gangster, right?
- Gangster.

936
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:23,024
Come on, get out the car.

937
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,111
Y'all know the routine.

938
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:32,452
Y'all know the routine. Yeah!
Get them goddamn clothes off!

939
01:04:35,707 --> 01:04:36,786
Do what he says.

940
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:40,536
Mister, yo! Put your clothes back on!
CB4 is in the house!

941
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:43,081
CB4! You know what I'm sayin'?

942
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,834
- Get on the ground!
- Don't shoot us.

943
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:49,841
Stay on the goddamn ground!
You, get out there, man!

944
01:04:50,683 --> 01:04:53,803
Get over there, man, get over there.
Get on the ground, move.

945
01:04:56,982 --> 01:04:58,809
Yeah, CB4 is in the house.

946
01:04:59,026 --> 01:05:00,189
CB4!

947
01:05:00,403 --> 01:05:03,487
It's me, Dead Mike, you know!
Nubian man!

948
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:08,195
And right behind me, I got my DJ
Stab Master Arson on the cash register.

949
01:05:08,412 --> 01:05:13,371
And over here, I got my
favourite Nubian man, MC Gusto.

950
01:05:13,584 --> 01:05:15,957
- Give 'em a shout-out!
- I didn't wanna...

951
01:05:16,171 --> 01:05:19,623
We're tired of bein' simple-ass rappers.
We livin' our lyrics!

952
01:05:19,842 --> 01:05:22,464
- We livin' it!
- Get back, motherfucker.

953
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:26,715
Evidence! Get over here.

954
01:05:26,934 --> 01:05:28,641
And just remember, CB4!

955
01:05:28,852 --> 01:05:30,976
- You got it!
- MC Gusto.

956
01:05:31,189 --> 01:05:35,234
- Stab Master Arson. Dead Mike.
- Give me that!

957
01:05:35,444 --> 01:05:39,394
We ain't rappin',
we straight up jackin'! Understand?

958
01:05:45,246 --> 01:05:49,707
- CB4, they're finally real gangsters.
- Real gangsters.

959
01:05:49,918 --> 01:05:52,493
You see this right here?

960
01:05:52,714 --> 01:05:54,457
You break up the group tomorrow.

961
01:05:54,674 --> 01:05:57,841
Or else, it's goin' to everybody, MTV,

962
01:05:58,053 --> 01:06:00,971
the police department, Connie Chung.

963
01:06:04,477 --> 01:06:06,304
Shut up, man.

964
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:15,401
Now CB4 is over or you're dead.

965
01:06:15,615 --> 01:06:17,573
40 Dog, get rid of this trash, man.

966
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:20,985
Punk!

967
01:06:26,586 --> 01:06:29,125
I'm callin' this private,
emergency meeting.

968
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:33,290
I've had it with how sloppy
you two have become.

969
01:06:33,512 --> 01:06:35,587
- What you talkin' about?
- Shut up.

970
01:06:35,805 --> 01:06:39,010
You don't say the words
the way you're supposed to.

971
01:06:39,227 --> 01:06:41,599
You're too spiritual
to rock the crowd.

972
01:06:41,812 --> 01:06:45,728
And Otis, you used to be
the coolest virgin in the world.

973
01:06:45,942 --> 01:06:50,237
But now that you got a little pussy,
your mixing has fallen the fuck off.

974
01:06:50,448 --> 01:06:53,982
Gusto broke out of jail, but that
ain't no reason for you to be buggin.

975
01:06:54,201 --> 01:06:56,160
- Shit.
- I'm not buggin'.

976
01:06:56,371 --> 01:06:59,289
I called this private meetin'
and look what happened!

977
01:07:00,293 --> 01:07:03,876
Hey, brothers, calm down.

978
01:07:06,383 --> 01:07:09,004
- You ain't fuckin' up on purpose?
- What?

979
01:07:09,219 --> 01:07:12,589
You and Bubba Ack wanna go solo.

980
01:07:12,807 --> 01:07:15,345
But damn, nigga, don't sabotage CB4.

981
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,095
Don't be so selfish, man.
You wanna step off, step the fuck off!

982
01:07:19,314 --> 01:07:22,316
I don't know why you want me
to knock you out, but so be it!

983
01:07:22,526 --> 01:07:24,650
- What you want, man?
- Yo, you're fired!

984
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:27,436
You can't fire me.
Vote me out like I was voted in!

985
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:29,152
Otis, throw his ass out!

986
01:07:29,368 --> 01:07:30,909
- Fuck this.
- Otis?

987
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:34,489
All I wanted to do was make music
and hang out with women.

988
01:07:34,707 --> 01:07:37,460
When y'all get your
shit straight, come see me.

989
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,626
That's it! Cell Block 4 is through.

990
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:42,591
You're free to buy
that fool his boat back to Africa.

991
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,173
You did this on purpose, didn't ya?

992
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:47,967
I'm outta here, man.

993
01:07:53,479 --> 01:07:57,726
Here we go again. Weird Warren's
Video V-V-V-V-Video Countdown.

994
01:07:57,942 --> 01:08:01,775
Word on the street
is CB4, null and void?

995
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:05,774
MC Gusto spotted in a record store,
armed robbery? What?

996
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:09,695
This hasn't stopped the rest of the
group from doin' their own thing.

997
01:08:09,957 --> 01:08:14,335
My main man, Dead Mike, solo tip
in his most personal recording yet.

998
01:08:14,546 --> 01:08:17,215
# I'm black, y'all
And I'm black, y'all

999
01:08:17,423 --> 01:08:19,583
# And I'm blacker than black
And I'm black, y'all

1000
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:21,924
# And I'm black, y'all
And I'm black, y'all

1001
01:08:22,137 --> 01:08:24,344
# And I'm blacker than black
And I'm black, y'all

1002
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:27,131
# I'm blickety-black blacker than black
Black, I'm blacker than black

1003
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:29,260
# Yo, because I'm black and I'm back

1004
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:31,271
# You want black and I'm black, y'all

1005
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,604
# And I'm blackety-black
And I'm black, y'all

1006
01:08:33,817 --> 01:08:36,025
# And I'm black, y'all
And I'm black, y'all

1007
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,443
# And I'm blackety-black
And I'm black, y'all

1008
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,983
# And I'm blickety-black black black
Blacker than black

1009
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:43,111
# Black, black, black,
black, black, y'all

1010
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:45,452
# And I'm black, y'all
And I'm black, y'all

1011
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:47,705
# And I'm blacker than black
Cos I'm black #

1012
01:08:48,126 --> 01:08:52,623
Cell Block 4's DJ, Stab Master Arson,
says, "Bang, I got my own thing."

1013
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,841
He's callin' his group
Silent But Deadly.

1014
01:08:56,887 --> 01:08:58,547
Uhh.

1015
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:01,008
# Stab Master

1016
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:03,261
# Stab Master

1017
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:05,603
# Stab Master

1018
01:09:06,606 --> 01:09:07,886
# Stab Master

1019
01:09:10,402 --> 01:09:11,599
# You know it, G

1020
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,944
# We've been outsmarted
We believe in our song and

1021
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:16,404
# We've been outsmarted
We believe in our song and

1022
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:18,658
# We've been outsmarted
We believe in our song and

1023
01:09:18,871 --> 01:09:21,195
# We've been outsmarted
We believe in our song and

1024
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:23,953
# Stab Master

1025
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:26,378
# Stab Master

1026
01:09:27,422 --> 01:09:28,964
# Stab Master

1027
01:09:29,758 --> 01:09:30,754
# Stab Master

1028
01:09:33,512 --> 01:09:34,841
# You know it, G #

1029
01:09:41,646 --> 01:09:44,768
- What you up to, Albert?
- Nothin'.

1030
01:09:45,235 --> 01:09:48,188
That's what I thought.
How come you're not workin'?

1031
01:09:48,404 --> 01:09:51,655
Toaster's workin'. The VCR's workin'.
How come you're not?

1032
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:55,450
- Almost liked it when you rapped.
- Pop, I'm in trouble.

1033
01:09:55,663 --> 01:09:59,709
You were in trouble when you decided
being Albert Brown wasn't good enough.

1034
01:09:59,918 --> 01:10:02,456
Pop, I'm tired of this MC Gusto thing.

1035
01:10:02,671 --> 01:10:05,757
I'm scared. It's over. It's over!

1036
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:09,799
Son, that's the best thing
you've said in a long time.

1037
01:10:11,598 --> 01:10:13,508
My life was messed up.

1038
01:10:13,726 --> 01:10:16,597
I turned into a monster.
I'd lost my friends.

1039
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:20,690
I'm usin' the word "nigga"
like it's my last name.

1040
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:24,400
Walkin' around callin' women
bitches and hos. That's not right.

1041
01:10:24,613 --> 01:10:27,366
My mother won't even speak to me.

1042
01:10:27,575 --> 01:10:30,909
Nothing's goin' right, nothin'.

1043
01:10:59,863 --> 01:11:00,859
Nah.

1044
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,647
Hey, Queen Latifah.

1045
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:41,908
Go on, girl.

1046
01:11:56,054 --> 01:12:00,301
Man, those were the days.

1047
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:03,222
I remember all those groups.

1048
01:12:03,437 --> 01:12:07,436
NWA, Ice Cube,

1049
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:09,939
CB4.

1050
01:12:10,403 --> 01:12:12,646
Was the lead guy's name Gusto?

1051
01:12:12,865 --> 01:12:16,530
- Yes!
- Shit! That nigga was a perpetrator!

1052
01:12:16,744 --> 01:12:20,956
Gusto and his whole crew
weren't real gangster rappers.

1053
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:23,836
They was as soft as a wet baby's ass.

1054
01:12:24,044 --> 01:12:27,628
They're straight-up fakes.

1055
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,592
They damn sure weren't no Wackee Dee!

1056
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:39,759
Yeah, boyee!

1057
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,199
- Yeah?
- It's me, man, Rip.

1058
01:12:55,415 --> 01:12:58,083
Man, I thought
you'd be in Africa by now.

1059
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,700
Cousin, this ain't no time to argue.

1060
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,375
Trust us is dead.

1061
01:13:03,924 --> 01:13:06,925
What? What happened?

1062
01:13:07,136 --> 01:13:09,627
Gusto bagged him
eatin' dinner with Sissy.

1063
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:12,256
He shot him?

1064
01:13:21,945 --> 01:13:25,065
Hey! Who knows the Heimlich manoeuvre?

1065
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:27,026
- Here, I do.
- No, no, no.

1066
01:13:27,243 --> 01:13:29,070
You're not doin' it right.

1067
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:32,744
That's not it. Here, let me try.

1068
01:13:37,088 --> 01:13:39,709
- Is he all right?
- He don't look so good.

1069
01:13:47,433 --> 01:13:49,722
Trust us.

1070
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:07,531
Thought you got away?

1071
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:12,168
Now you're layin' dead.
But we ain't settled this yet, right?

1072
01:14:12,378 --> 01:14:14,668
Where's my money, motherfucker?

1073
01:14:14,882 --> 01:14:17,253
Where's my money, motherfucker?

1074
01:14:17,467 --> 01:14:19,960
I want my money.
Funeral or no, I want my money!

1075
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:25,138
If I have to give you mouth-to-mouth and
revive your black ass, I want my money!

1076
01:14:35,698 --> 01:14:39,612
Hey, look, we need to
go outside and talk. All right?

1077
01:14:50,256 --> 01:14:53,044
Look, I'm sorry about
everything that happened.

1078
01:14:54,302 --> 01:14:56,759
I shouldn't have let
Gusto scare me like that.

1079
01:14:58,306 --> 01:15:00,383
I think it's time we got back together.

1080
01:15:03,563 --> 01:15:05,057
It's cool with me, Al.

1081
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:09,564
What about you, Rip?

1082
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,653
Brothers...

1083
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:16,987
...let the past be in the past, man.

1084
01:15:17,788 --> 01:15:21,917
All right, it's about time
for CB4 to head back to the stage.

1085
01:15:22,127 --> 01:15:23,918
We have to do this for Trust us.

1086
01:15:24,128 --> 01:15:26,702
We gotta let people
know that CB4 is for real.

1087
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:29,462
I'm with that, but what
we gonna do about Gusto?

1088
01:15:29,677 --> 01:15:32,844
Trust us is laying in there
because of this clown.

1089
01:15:33,056 --> 01:15:37,100
- We gonna let him get away with that?
- Don't worry. We're gonna get Gusto

1090
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:39,600
and we're gonna get back on stage.

1091
01:15:39,814 --> 01:15:41,771
Now, listen to this.

1092
01:15:41,982 --> 01:15:44,023
What we have to do...

1093
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:52,735
Yo, when I get finished
with those CB4 kids,

1094
01:15:52,954 --> 01:15:55,528
they gonna be CB0.

1095
01:15:55,749 --> 01:15:57,373
Yo, hurry up back, man.

1096
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:05,583
- Yeah, who this?
- Hi, Gusto.

1097
01:16:05,802 --> 01:16:08,756
This is Sissy.
You remember Sissy, don't you?

1098
01:16:08,972 --> 01:16:11,594
How could I forget
the bitch that ditched me?

1099
01:16:13,561 --> 01:16:16,563
Well, that was then
and this is now.

1100
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:20,226
And if you're ready
for something really special,

1101
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:23,445
why don't you meet me
at the Honeyroll Hotel

1102
01:16:23,656 --> 01:16:26,327
on Locash Boulevard in an hour?

1103
01:16:28,286 --> 01:16:31,205
So you're finally ready
for the big dick, huh?

1104
01:16:49,478 --> 01:16:51,720
So, you know,

1105
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,938
I've been waiting for this
moment for a real long time.

1106
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,981
I just love hearin' about anything...

1107
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:03,741
...long.

1108
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:08,616
You know, I got
a little present for you, babe.

1109
01:17:08,835 --> 01:17:11,503
- Yeah?
- It's right over here.

1110
01:17:16,635 --> 01:17:20,051
Check it out. Got my Jimmy hat.

1111
01:17:20,264 --> 01:17:22,968
Oh, my.

1112
01:17:23,183 --> 01:17:27,431
Yeah, nice and large,
baby, just like me.

1113
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:36,482
Nah, baby, you better try this one.

1114
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:40,200
Jokes. Enough with this foreplay.

1115
01:17:40,412 --> 01:17:43,283
- I'm gonna get busy, baby.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1116
01:17:43,499 --> 01:17:46,073
- What's up?
- Why don't you let me

1117
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:49,248
slip into something
a little more comfortable?

1118
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,956
Slip into something
more comfortable?

1119
01:17:52,176 --> 01:17:55,925
Bitch, what could be more comfortable
than what you already got on?

1120
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:57,514
Don't worry.

1121
01:17:59,268 --> 01:18:00,846
You won't be disappointed.

1122
01:18:01,771 --> 01:18:03,099
Damn, bitch.

1123
01:18:08,153 --> 01:18:12,649
You know, you been talkin'
a lot of shit lately.

1124
01:18:12,866 --> 01:18:16,912
I sure hope you ready for this, baby.

1125
01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:18,865
Oh, yeah, baby. I'm real ready.

1126
01:18:28,427 --> 01:18:29,423
Oh, yeah!

1127
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:35,172
Yeah, I'm ready.

1128
01:18:47,949 --> 01:18:51,484
I'm gonna get some pussy.
I'm gonna get some pussy.

1129
01:18:57,043 --> 01:18:58,537
Yeah!

1130
01:18:59,838 --> 01:19:01,333
Come on, sugar dumplin'.

1131
01:19:01,548 --> 01:19:05,464
- Daddy's waitin' for ya.
- Turn the lights down, baby.

1132
01:19:06,554 --> 01:19:08,511
You don't like to watch.

1133
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:12,768
I'll turn it down for ya.
Come on now.

1134
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:19,355
Now get down on your hands and knees.

1135
01:19:19,569 --> 01:19:24,066
My hands and knees?
You're gonna make things difficult, huh?

1136
01:19:24,283 --> 01:19:28,614
OK, I'll get down on my hands
and knees. I'll play your little game.

1137
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:32,496
- Now, crawl over here.
- I don't mind crawlin'.

1138
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:37,456
- I don't mind beggin' either, baby.
- Assume the position.

1139
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:41,009
I'll assume the position,
I assume we're gettin' ready to fuck.

1140
01:19:42,721 --> 01:19:45,391
Damn, bitch! You!

1141
01:19:45,599 --> 01:19:47,889
- What are you doin'?
- Who's the bitch?

1142
01:19:49,021 --> 01:19:51,559
- Damn you, bitch.
- Get up!

1143
01:19:51,774 --> 01:19:55,190
- Come on!
- I was the biggest man in Locash.

1144
01:19:55,402 --> 01:19:57,443
So, you call yourself a man?

1145
01:19:58,531 --> 01:20:01,283
You gonna pay. You gots to pay.

1146
01:20:03,329 --> 01:20:06,414
- Shit!
- Don't even try it.

1147
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,709
Freeze!

1148
01:20:10,962 --> 01:20:13,122
Man, not again.

1149
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:19,181
We got your gangster ass now, don't we?

1150
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:22,593
Tiger drawers wearin' motherfucker.

1151
01:20:23,228 --> 01:20:25,018
Fuck you, man.

1152
01:20:29,693 --> 01:20:31,602
Get out!

1153
01:20:34,866 --> 01:20:36,774
Shut up!

1154
01:20:36,992 --> 01:20:39,117
Oooh!

1155
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,790
# I need love

1156
01:20:53,762 --> 01:20:55,388
# I need love

1157
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:00,806
Nah!

1158
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:14,322
Well, we're backstage at Gusto's.

1159
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,028
You can really feel
the electricity here.

1160
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:21,413
We're anxiously anticipating
the big CB4 reunion show

1161
01:21:21,629 --> 01:21:23,704
which is about
to start any moment now.

1162
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,593
The fellows are
putting the final touches

1163
01:21:26,802 --> 01:21:29,375
on their make-up, mascara, pancake...

1164
01:21:29,596 --> 01:21:31,803
- Small world!
- They're comin' out.

1165
01:21:32,015 --> 01:21:35,052
- Yeah!
- All right, fellows. OK, hi.

1166
01:21:35,269 --> 01:21:39,054
Well, this is it. What are you guys
gonna do after the show, huh?

1167
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:41,646
Yo, me myself,
I'm gettin' my sisters a maid.

1168
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,983
What's up, girls?

1169
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:48,693
Yeah, and I'm gonna open up my own line
of personal Nubian hygiene products,

1170
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:53,620
featuring deodorant because the
black man has a different kind of funk!

1171
01:21:53,832 --> 01:21:57,415
- Understand?
- That's true. Very distinctive funk.

1172
01:21:57,628 --> 01:22:00,796
I'm goin' down to South America.
I'm takin' a search party.

1173
01:22:01,007 --> 01:22:05,089
I'm gonna find Kurtis Blow. I know
you're out there. I'm comin' to get ya!

1174
01:22:05,304 --> 01:22:08,554
But serious, I'm just
gonna be plain old Albert.

1175
01:22:08,766 --> 01:22:10,759
Stop! Come on.
Stop hittin' me, man.

1176
01:22:10,977 --> 01:22:14,513
Come on, no accordion.
Stop, stop!

1177
01:22:15,149 --> 01:22:16,809
OK, that sounds like fun too.

1178
01:22:17,026 --> 01:22:19,814
All right, get out there
and give 'em a hell of a show.

1179
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:22,022
Ladies and gentlemen,

1180
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,651
a round of applause for CB4.

1181
01:22:32,002 --> 01:22:33,829
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

1182
01:22:34,796 --> 01:22:37,549
We gettin' ready to take it
back to the old school!

1183
01:22:44,015 --> 01:22:47,634
# I said hip hop, the hippie
The hippie dibby hip hip hop

1184
01:22:47,853 --> 01:22:50,012
# And you don't stop the rockin'
to the bang bang boogie

1185
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:53,186
# Say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

1186
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:57,815
# See, I am Albert Brown
and I'd like to say hello

1187
01:22:58,032 --> 01:23:00,819
# To the black, to the white
the red and the brown

1188
01:23:01,035 --> 01:23:04,321
# The purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang

1189
01:23:04,581 --> 01:23:07,702
# The boogie to the boogie say up jump
the boogie to the bang bang boogie

1190
01:23:07,919 --> 01:23:09,876
# Let's rock, you don't stop

1191
01:23:10,087 --> 01:23:12,461
# Rock the rhythm
that'll make your body rock

1192
01:23:12,675 --> 01:23:16,803
# Now what you hear is not a test
Cos we're rappin' to the beat

1193
01:23:17,345 --> 01:23:19,885
# And me, the groove
and my friend are gonna try

1194
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,759
# To move your feet...

1195
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,435
Yo, what's up? This is Gusto
with the new Sayonara jeep.

1196
01:23:26,648 --> 01:23:29,852
It's got an engine that defines dope.

1197
01:23:30,069 --> 01:23:33,071
You just snap this baby
into your glove compartment,

1198
01:23:34,491 --> 01:23:35,950
and you're good to go.

1199
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:40,205
So you're sayin', yo, Gusto,
what's under the hoodie?

1200
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,454
Sayonara, it's all that!

1201
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:50,091
# Just go with the flow
Cos I want you to know

1202
01:23:50,302 --> 01:23:54,002
# I want you
I need you

1203
01:23:54,932 --> 01:23:57,601
# Baby, baby, won't you be mine

1204
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,266
- # Baby, please
- # I want you

1205
01:24:01,564 --> 01:24:03,107
# I need you

1206
01:24:04,108 --> 01:24:07,194
# Baby, baby, let's spend some time...

1207
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:11,990
Yo, what's up? This is a P-E-S-A,

1208
01:24:12,785 --> 01:24:14,862
Public Enemy Service Announcement.

1209
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,571
They're tryin' to make
hard-core rap disappear.

1210
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:21,872
Tryin' to make it final for the vinyl.
Sayin' it's time for the wax to relax.

1211
01:24:22,589 --> 01:24:26,670
A sticker here, a sticker there and now
we wear the sticker like a badge.

1212
01:24:26,886 --> 01:24:30,005
Now, what? Rap is synonymous with black.

1213
01:24:30,222 --> 01:24:34,055
Even our own don't realize rap
is even blacker than themselves.

1214
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:37,105
To the whites who consider
themselves establishment,

1215
01:24:37,314 --> 01:24:40,481
they fear rap is the beginning
of cultural overthrow

1216
01:24:40,693 --> 01:24:44,692
in their very own households between
themselves and their kids. Uh-oh!

1217
01:24:47,618 --> 01:24:50,287
The next guy that moves
gets the same treatment.

1218
01:24:50,496 --> 01:24:52,370
Line up over there. This is a stickup.

1219
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:55,533
# Stick 'em up, stick 'em up
Stick 'em up

1220
01:24:55,752 --> 01:24:58,245
# Stick 'em up, stick 'em up
Stick 'em up

1221
01:24:58,464 --> 01:25:00,872
# Stick 'em up, stick 'em up
Stick 'em up

1222
01:25:01,092 --> 01:25:03,465
# Stick 'em up, stick 'em up in the air

1223
01:25:03,678 --> 01:25:06,928
# Face down, don't turn around
Listen to the bass pound

1224
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,846
# For more types of angles
This ain't no star-spangled banner

1225
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:12,682
# More truth than tropicana
Rockin' New York to Savannah

1226
01:25:12,897 --> 01:25:14,273
# Cos it's Macka Framma

1227
01:25:14,483 --> 01:25:16,724
# When I go to a show
Some run, some come

1228
01:25:16,943 --> 01:25:19,103
# Many have fun to watch a nig
get dumb

1229
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,985
# The right way
The high way, the tight way

1230
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,407
# You're fuckin' right that
I might say, stick 'em

1231
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,826
# Stick 'em up, stick 'em up
Stick 'em up

1232
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,446
# Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up in the air

1233
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:37,336
- # May day on the front line
- # Front line

1234
01:25:45,184 --> 01:25:47,593
- # May day on the front line
- # Front line

1235
01:25:54,403 --> 01:25:55,518
# Check it out, check it out

1236
01:25:55,738 --> 01:25:57,648
# Go with the PM
Steppin' through the AM

1237
01:25:57,866 --> 01:25:59,859
# Flippin' that south
When I prophesise the man

1238
01:26:00,077 --> 01:26:02,200
# Catch a break
and blow it up like TNT

1239
01:26:02,413 --> 01:26:04,572
# Or gettin' filthy, nasty as LSD

1240
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:06,749
# I'll make you insane, crazy
You'll flip

1241
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,534
# Dribble up and down like constipated
You wanna jump around

1242
01:26:09,755 --> 01:26:11,332
# All that tryin' to fade me

1243
01:26:11,548 --> 01:26:14,550
# I think you hit it wrong
PM Dawn got it goin'on

1244
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,759
# Nocturnal is in the house
Nocturnal is in the house

1245
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:23,304
# Nocturnal is in the house
Nocturnal is in the house...

1246
01:26:23,521 --> 01:26:25,598
# Creepin' up on ya
Creepin', creepin' up on ya

1247
01:26:25,816 --> 01:26:28,022
# Creepin' up on ya
Creepin', creepin' up on ya

1248
01:28:00,634 --> 01:28:03,091
- How much for a pack of gum?
- 50 cents.

1249
01:28:03,305 --> 01:28:07,172
- 50 cents? How much for a newspaper?
- 35 cents.

1250
01:28:07,392 --> 01:28:10,559
35 cents? How about
I give you 15 cents

1251
01:28:10,771 --> 01:28:12,349
and you give me the good news?
