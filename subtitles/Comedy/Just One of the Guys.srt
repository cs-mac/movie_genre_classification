    Denise, I'm really into
    this article.

39
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,346
              I know, but I need
              your advice,

40
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,780
                 and you are
                 my best friend.

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,716
         and I tried to deal
         with this myself, okay,

42
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,184
                  and I'm really

         me out Saturday night,

00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,254
        and I'm not too thrilled
        about any of them,

45
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,090
            but I think I should
            go out with someone

46
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,691
        in case I don't
        have a real boyfriend

            You have the perfect
            college boyfriend.

                he might move up

00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,319
I think if you and I

and woman on earth,

117

the human race
would die out.

                I understand.

125
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,440
                    They can use

00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,192
      Does he do this
      at the dinner table?

135
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,927
             Don't get me wrong.

136
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,229
        It's not like I've
        never had sex before.

137
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,564
I've had lots
of sex.

138
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,065
              It's just that now
              I'd like to try it

139
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,934
                 with a partner.

140
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,870
We really have to get back
to school.

141
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,706
Yes, we must
get back.

142
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,208
I want to make sure my article's

143

             in the trophy case.

144
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,045
Yes, we really
must get going.

145

         You have
         to get going?

146
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,015
    I'm 15 years old.

147
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,082
         In two years,

148
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,918
I reach the peak
of my sexual powers.

149
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,655
The clock is ticking.
I have to get jamming.

             embarrassed?

152
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,929
Nope. I'm horny.

153
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,731
Horny will kick
embarrassment's ass

154
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,733

155
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,301
                Budster,
                listen to me.

156

 Don't you want your first time
 to be with someone you love?

157
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,775
I guarantee it,
I'll be in love.

158
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,711
        There's Lisa MacAdoo.

159
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,281
I'll hear she'll do
anything with anybody.

160
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,685
                She looks pretty
                cheap to me.

161
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,354
Me too.

162
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,523
                    Denise, I am
                    so excited.

163
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,824

            means,

164
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,192
                everything in
                life to me.

165
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,428
I know. Just make sure you work
in the Sports section

166
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,563
That way we can interview
all the cute jocks.

167
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,065
             You are going to be
             so proud of me.

168
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,001
          I am going to make
          such a great reporter.

169
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,371
I'm not there.

170
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,539
                      Why aren't
                      you there?

171
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,911
              Neal Perlow
              and Joseph Dreyer?

172
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,989
And then I had
Terry Griffith,

173
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,725
fourth period civics.

174
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,227
Did you see
what she's wearing?

175
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,629
The legs
do not stop.

176
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,064
I say
we flunk her.

177
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,532
Keep her here
for another year.

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,268
You better
be careful, George.

179
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,603
You could lose
your job.

180

                    Be worth it.

181
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,607
                It's not that
                great a job.

182
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,714
            Terry...

183
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,649
 What's wrong with my article?

184
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,954
Well, there isn't anything
wrong with it, per se.

185
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,290
It's just not outstanding work.

186
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,526
      Well, I think it is.

187
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,829
 What do you give me
 straight A's for, my wardrobe?

188
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,165
I give you the A's
because of your hard work,

189
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,567
      and you write well,

190
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,036
    but this contest,

191
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,538
  it's a completely different
  ball game.

192
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,074
  When I read those articles,
  I have to ask myself,

193
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,009
"Does this person
have a nose for the news?"

194
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,144
"Do they dig out

195
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,046
the most interesting
angle on a story?"

196
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,881
 Oh, so I see,
 what you're trying to tell me

197
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,350
is that the nutritional content
of our school lunches

198
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,551
    isn't interesting.

199
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,924
Now, Terry, I know
that you're disappointed,

200
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,826
     but I had to pick kids

I like
that attitude,

204
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,136
     but don't you think
     that it would be nice

205
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,938
    to have something
    to fall back on?

Uh, well, you're a pretty girl,
you could be a model.

208
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,478
          Be a model?

209
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,381
  Why? Because a pretty girl
  can't possibly have a brain?

 Can I tell you a little story?

234
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,379
            When I was a kid,

235
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,848
        I was obsessed
        with being a fireman.

236
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,850
              I set little fires
              in the backyard,

237
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,454
            and I practiced
            putting them out.

238
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,724
            Then one day,
            when... I was 12,

239
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,793
             I learned I could
             never be a fireman.

240
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,862
Why, what happened?

241
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,964
            I found out how much
            money they make.

Don't you understand

that I don't care
what reporters make?

245
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,940
  I can't remember a time
  when the was anything else

246
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,908
              I wanted to do,

247
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,243
                 and it's pretty
                 discouraging

248
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,544

some pretty nice bucks.

      I can do it, either.

  Well, no, that's not exactly

00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,544
                    Hey, not me.

275
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:03,582
             These women have
             my deepest respect.

276
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,385
For showing
their boobs?

277
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,921
            And for their minds.

278
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,322
              It just so happens

279
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,924
                  that Kim here
                  reads Vonnegut

280
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,159
             in her bubble bath,

281
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,528
        and Louann has
        dedicated her centerfold

282
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,331
                to help clean up
                toxic waste,

283
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,532
             and the only reason

284
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,702
        Barbara does her physics
        homework buck-naked

285
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,338
                  is 'cause that
                  library's hot.

286
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,708
Come on, Buddy
admit it.

287
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,543
You would love to
spend your entire life

288
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,712
just using
women's bodies.

289
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,914
            Yeah, all but
            the last 60 seconds.

290
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,151
     I'd like a little time
     to reminisce.

291
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,321
Can't you think of anything
more profound than getting laid?

292
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,922
        A blowjob?

293
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,793
                      I'm sorry.

294
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,295
This is the perfect end
to my day.

295
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:53,132
I mean, it's as if
women's lib never existed.

296
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,735
Today's woman has the freedom
to be just as sick and perverted

297
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,137
          as us guys.

298
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,506
     Oh, that's wonderful.

299
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,242
     I mean, I write
     an excellent article,

300
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,978
 and just because I'm... cute,
 no one takes me seriously.

301
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,414
It's not fair.

302
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:11,717
  And yet somehow you find
  the courage to go on living.

303
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:12,718
         You got guts.

304
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,655
     Sometimes I just wish
     I were a guy.

305
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,824
         No, you don't.

306
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,460
             The male body needs
             sex at all times.

307
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,761
             It's a living hell.

308
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,231
I bet if a guy turned in
the same exact article,

309
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,400
it would be at
the <i>Sun-Tribune</i> right now.

310
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,468
Yeah, no kidding.

311
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,139
Hey, does Miss April
look straight?

312
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,077
        [DOORBELL RINGS]

313
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,350
What are the odds of this being
a homeless nymphomaniac?

314
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:47,886
      Is your sister home?

315
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,355
Yeah.

316
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,223
Hey, Terry,
you got company.

317
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:55,828
             Terry?

318
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,232
Why am I
brain-damaged?

319
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,301
I just fooled
my own brother.

320
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,936
            Hey, I wasn't
            paying attention.

321
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,070
                    Now I am.

322
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,472
                Hello, Terry.

323
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,208
I think I can
pull this off.

324
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,376
                    This morning
                    I knew her.

325
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,677
                I talked to her.

326
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,112
             She screamed at me.

327
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,947
     Everything was great.

328
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,882
 Now she's wearing my clothes.

329
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,684
 Hey, who do you think you are,
  <i>Tootsie?</i>

330
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,586
              No.

331
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,321
Okay, <i>Yentl?</i>

332
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,724
What do you
want to be, a rabbi?

333
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,026
      Just tell me what's wrong.

334
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,694
                     Really?

335
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:36,335
            Okay. Well, uh...

336
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,303
                 Look how you're
                 standing.

337
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,005
                    I mean, drop
                    your hands.

338
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,775
                 Okay, now stick
                 your hip in.

339
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,144
             All right, now move
             your feet apart.

340
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:49,114
                  Hey... Guys
                  take up space.

341
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,083
          All right, now, you've
          got to look tougher.

342
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,751
Very crucial.

343
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,687
Something
every guy does.

344
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,255
Let me see you
scratch your balls.

345
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,459
                Come on, try it.

346
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,933
                  Wait a minute.

347
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,436
            Watch the master.

348
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:14,373
             Now, first, there's
             your basic shift...

349
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,045
                  But that's not
                  always enough.

350
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,947
              Sometimes, you've
              got to get inside,

351
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,116
                dig a little,
                let some air in,

352
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,918
             move things around.

353
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,254
Yeah, well,
maybe my balls don't itch.

354
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,359
  All balls itch. It's a fact.

355
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,361
  Well, maybe this would help.

356
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,705
                      Not bad.

357
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:50,275
Shit. Maybe I
should try that.

358
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,978
Okay.
Let's see you walk.

359
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,516
                    Hold it.

360
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,319
Look, you got
balls now.

361
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,520
Use them.

362
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,456
  Say, baby, what's happening?

363
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,893
 I'm a lean, mean, sex machine,
 and that be the way it is.

364
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,328
Say, baby,
what's happening?

365
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,463
I'm a lean, mean,
sex machine.

366
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:15,067
                  and that be
                  the way it is.

367
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,536
I think you'll pass
as long as you don't move.

368
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,872
I'm going to do it.

369
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,306
I'm going to take
that article

370
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,808
    to Sturgis-Wilder,

371
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,510
and I'm going to submit it
as a guy.

372
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,011
    It makes perfect sense.

373
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,681
    You got a problem,
    you get in drag.

374
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,350
  You don't think I can do it,
  do you?

375
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,654
        No way...

376
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,956
                 But d love
                 to see you try.

377
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,331
Hey, how you doing?

378
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,967
     We'll talk more later.

379
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,273
                Once you're into
                power blitzing,

380
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,509
             doing super sets is
             like jerking off.

381
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,912
     The key is to work out
     every possible minute.

382
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,814
             Like, say you don't
             have any weights?

383
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,751
            You use freshmen.

384
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,486
                  I'm serious.

385
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:44,323
        Excuse me! This'll
        just take a minute.

386
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,458
                    Okay, get
                    a good grip,

387
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,093
                 bend your knees
                 and lift.

388
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,864
     One, two. One, two...

389
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,532
                     [GRUNTING]

390
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,801
         Hey, no pain,
         no gain.

391
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,236
    This is great
    for the deltoids.

392
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,570
          Thanks, kid.

393
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,673
                  Happy to help.

394
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,684
        Who invited you?

395
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,187
      Uh... I'm new here.

396
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:19,091
    Just what we need,
    another pussy.

397
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,561
        Strong as an ox,

398
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,296
      and almost as smart.

399
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,465
- Ooh...
- Ooh...

400
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:30,169
Another good exercise
for upper body strength...

401
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,904
 The pussy toss, for distance.

402
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,639
             Hey, get off me!

403
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,941
     Get off me right now!

404
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,211
    Ow! Watch the prickers.

405
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,646
             Damn!

406
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,520
Great bunch of guys.

407
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,789
                I see you met
                Greg Tolan.

408

00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:18,317
 Your writing skills are fine,

550
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:21,487
      but, man, this stuff
      is really boring.

551
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:24,289
You've got to
grab the reader.

552
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:26,759
Goose them
a little.

553
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:30,195
    Right. Goose them.

554
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:31,730
Just because you're a guy

555
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:33,899
  doesn't mean you can't write
  with sensitivity,

556
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:37,169
with feeling,
with heart,

557
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:40,305
    but you do show promise.

558
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:43,042
     Look, I'm not going
     to choose the winners

559
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:44,843
until a week from Monday.

560
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:48,080
So think of something exciting.
Try again.

561
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:55,087
Yeah, well, uh... Thanks.

562
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,632
          DENISE: Terry, I hate
          when you're depressed.

563
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,668
          I mean, if you're this
          upset over your life,

564
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:12,671
                    I should
                    be suicidal.

565
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:15,007
            I mean, look what
            Kevin sent you.

566
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,508
                 I'd do anything

567
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:18,744
                 to come home
                 and find roses.

568
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:22,181
     Can we define the word
     "anything"?

569
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,416
Maybe Raymaker
was right

570
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:26,585
about my article,

571
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:29,888
but I know
I can do better.

572
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,924
I'm just confused.

573
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:35,461
  Of course, you're confused.
  You're wearing my underwear.

574
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,667
             Terry, forget it.
             Come back to Pearl.

575
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,235
                  So you got
                  a bad haircut.

576
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:44,770
                I mean, you've
                got a great life

577
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:47,039
                  and a fabulous
                  boyfriend.

578
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,340
        I can't give up.

579
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,976
And today was a disaster,
and I was a major geek,

580
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:53,479
      but they all thought
      I was a guy.

581
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,947
              I was in the boys'
              locker room!

582
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,281
        You were?

583
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,416
              Yes.

584
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:58,450
And they were?
Yes.

585
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:00,519
                Can I be your
                younger brother?

586
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,521
     There's a story here.

587
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:03,655
    I don't know what it is,

588
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:05,357
    but I've got
    until a week from Monday

589
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,892
                     to find it.

590
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,161
Hey, what about

591
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:12,564
"Girl Gets in Locker Room,
Turns Stupid."

592
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,069
                I can still
                win that job.

593
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,737
        I'm going to go
        to Sturgis-Wilder,

594
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,572
          and I'm going to start
          making friends...

595
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,408
    Any friends I can find.

596
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:24,543
    What if Kevin finds out

597
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,078
you were in
the boys' locker room?

598
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:27,680
                    Denise...

599
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:31,250
 Would Woodward and Bernstein
 worry about their girlfriends?

600
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,818
              No.

601
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:37,856
Anyway,
Kevin will never find out.

602
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:39,892
              Unless I tell him,

603
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,194
    which I would never do...

604
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:45,097
As long as Denise
cooperates.

605
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:46,965
Denise?

606
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:50,569
                  When pigs fly.

607
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:53,339
Never hurts to ask.

608
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,945
It's driving
me crazy.

609
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:01,413
I looked
everywhere.

610
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:04,650
I can't find the back
of my earring.

611
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:06,618
What am I
supposed to do,

612
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:09,221
walk around all day
with one earring?

613
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,656
That is so punk.

614
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:11,990
                Listen, all
                you've got to do

615
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:13,425
             is break the eraser
             off a pencil.

616
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,394
        and you can use it
        to hold your earring on.

617
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:16,762
                Should get you
                through the day.

618
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,064
Oh, thanks.

619
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:26,805
                 I have sisters.

620
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:44,356
                  We're in
                  the cafeteria.

621
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:46,358
      Everything eats
      and is eaten by something.

622
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:47,760
                Don't take it
                personally.

623
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:50,162
            Remember when I--

624
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,598
Hi. Uh, I'm Terry Griffith.

625
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:56,201
 Oh, hi.
 I'm Harold "Reptile" Sherpico.

626
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,504
It's time to feed Snowball
his lunch.

627
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:02,207
    Oh, Snowball. He's cute.

628
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:03,342
                  Oh, that's not
                  Snowball.

629
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,712
    This is Snowball.

630
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,680
         That's lunch.

631
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,451
                 They don't make
                 Snake Chow.

632
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,486
 It was very nice meeting you.

633
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,789
                    Nice meeting
                    you too.

634
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:18,323
    Want some company?

635
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:22,194
                    Want some
                    company?

636
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:23,896
    Want some company?

637
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:25,831
Uh, yeah, sure.

638
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:33,272
      I'm Terry Griffith.

639
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,074
             Oh, I'm sorry.
             I forgot your name.

640
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:36,141
        Rick Morehouse.

641
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:38,344
      Oh, yeah. That's it.

642
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,379
     Last time we met,
     I was in some bushes.

643
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,982
    Right. Big fun
    being the new kid, huh?

644
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,051
                    Are you new?

645
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,453
        Two months ago.

646
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,388
  Actually, I'm a professional
  new kid.

647
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:50,889
Seven schools
in three years.

648
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:52,591
I really know
how to register.

649
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,193
                      Excuse me!

650
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,395
                     Hi! Thanks.

651
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,464
                It worked great.

652
00:34:58,531 --> 00:35:00,566
                 He knew how to
                 fix my earring.

653
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:04,336
That's because
he's a little tulip.

654
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:08,474
You know
Deborah Strowbridge?

655
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,676
                     Not really.

656
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:13,379
But, I mean,
she talked to you.

657
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,214
Deborah Strowbridge
is perfection.

658
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:18,250
  Well, seems to me
  like she's got a boyfriend.

659
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:21,053
Yeah, well, there's
no accounting for taste.

660
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,021
      So are you a senior?

661
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:23,055
Yeah.

662
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,089
     You going to college?

663
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:26,892
      Well, I like music,

664
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,927
  and d like to do something  i,

665
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:31,196
 but I'm not too sure you have
 to go to school to do it.

666
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:33,866
    I dig music a lot too.

667
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:36,468
     I like, um, The Clash,
     The Talking Heads,

668
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:38,370
and Springsteen and Prince.

669
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:39,672
Oh yeah?
That's pretty cool.

670
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:41,373
        Listen to this.

671
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,081
            Look. What a fox.

672
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,550
Dresses like
Elvis Costello,

673
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:53,719
looks like
the Karate Kid.

674
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:56,955
        I'm going to get him.

675
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:03,262
  Severe intestinal disorder?

676
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,030
              What's the matter?

677
00:36:05,098 --> 00:36:06,565
             You having a little
             tummy ache?

678
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:09,234
          What are you, a pussy?

679
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:16,475
Uh... My doctor said

680
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:20,012
that I should be okay
by a week from Monday.

681
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,881
So I guess I'll just
go to Study Hall--

682
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:26,952
                  No, you won't.

683
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,756
            I have a little
            job for you, son.

684
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,766
          Here you go.

685
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:44,303
    Hey, knock yourself out.

686
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:47,306
    Hey, you look

looking at?

690
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:01,053
                    Nothing.

691
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:02,654

        Nice to see you.

693
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:15,501
Hi. I'm Sandy.

694
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:16,568
                     Terry.

695
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:18,270
Yeah, I know.

696
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:20,706
That's an incredible tie.
Where'd you get it?

697
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:22,174
                     At a store.

698
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:24,209
            Bitchen.

699
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:27,146
So I guess
if you're new here,

700
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:28,981
you don't have
a girlfriend.

701
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,049
     Yeah, well, I got one

702
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,383
                      back home.

703
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:32,851
  Long-distance relationship?

704
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:35,220
Good luck.

705
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:36,255
        Yo, Rick!

706
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:39,158
     You want a ride home?

707
00:37:39,225 --> 00:37:41,660
                     Uh... Sure.

708
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:45,631
Yeah, well, got to go, Sandy,
so I guess I'll see you around.

709
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:54,039
        Yeah, you will.

710

She's pretty nice.

711
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:58,577
Yeah, but I got this one rule--

712
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:01,113
I never go out with girls
who say "bitchen."

713
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,323
      Pull up right here.
      This is fine.

00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,563
Thanks for the ride.

715
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,531
            Well, uh... What are
            you doing now?

716
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,834
I don't know. Nothing.
Did you want to come in?

717
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:23,435
                Well, I was
                just going to--

718
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:26,405
 I was going to tune up my car,
 maybe play a little football,

719
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,575
     but, yeah, I got time.

720
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:31,043
Okay.

721
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,927
      Um, if my mom comes
      home from work,

722
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:50,829
     and she asks you
     about my girlfriend...

723
00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:54,066
    Just so you know,
    her name is Alice,

724
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:56,635
and she looks a lot
like Chris Evert Lloyd.

725
00:38:56,703 --> 00:38:59,438
I just don't want her to worry,
you know, about my social life.

726
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:02,808
  Yeah, but Chris Evert Lloyd?

727

          It was Wimbledon Week.

728
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:06,011
             Do you want a beer?

729
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,314
Yeah, I'll take a brewski.

730
00:39:18,058 --> 00:39:20,726
So you don't really
have a girlfriend.

731
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:22,561
                 You guessed it.

732
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:24,163
What about
the prom?

733
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,497
                  What about it?

734
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:27,599
      Well, yoknow,
      it sounds all right,

      that big surf place.

Don't you
want to go?

738
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:34,773
     Yeah, but it's kind of
     a romantic night.

739
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:37,443
                 I'd rather not
                 go with my mom.

740
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,480
Well, did you ask anyone?

 Well, you'd better get going!

first choice?

                of questions.

              slept with a girl?

756

    Yeah.

It's no big deal.

00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,012
Um, just after
my dad died,

760
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,380
this friend of my mom's...

761
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:17,149
I think she wanted
to cheer me up.

762
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:20,953
She did.

            room over there?

                to James Brown,

    and ask her out?

832
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:46,291
No, you've got to...
say something nice,

833
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:50,229
like how pretty
her eyes are.

834
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:52,197
Girls eat up
that crap.

835
00:43:52,265 --> 00:43:53,799
                    Come on.

836
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,881
              Hi, Jeanine.

837
00:44:08,948 --> 00:44:10,616
                             Hi.

838
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:12,751
I keep forgetting
your name.

839
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:14,486
             Rick... Morehouse.

840
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:16,488
You know, I sit
right next to you

841
00:44:16,556 --> 00:44:17,589
in civics class?

842
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:26,565
You have
beautiful eyes.

843
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:35,574
I'll bet.

844
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:38,010
Do you have a--
a date for the prom?

845
00:44:39,112 --> 00:44:41,046
Of course.
It's next week. Why?

846
00:44:41,114 --> 00:44:44,383
     Official
     prom committee survey.

847
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:46,085
      Thank you very much.

848
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:49,555
                Terry...

849
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:55,094
             TERRY: This has got
             to be the one.

850
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:56,795
                You know why?

851
00:44:56,863 --> 00:45:00,232
Because I've asked
everybody else.

852
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,669
            No. Because I've
            got this feeling.

853
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:05,404
            True, I've had
            this feeling before,

854
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:07,006
                but this time...

855
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:15,614
                     Uh... Beth.

856
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:18,951
Doing anything, uh, prom night?

857
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:21,120
I'm going to the prom.

858
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,257
            What about Saturday?

859
00:45:25,325 --> 00:45:26,525
I'm busy.

860
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:27,693
                      Night?

861
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:29,328
I'm busy.

862
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:30,362
            How about Sunday?

863
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,597
I'm busy.

864
00:45:31,664 --> 00:45:33,232
                  How about any
                  night in 1987?

865
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:34,500
I'm busy.

866
00:45:37,637 --> 00:45:39,905
            How about yesterday?
            You busy yesterday?

867
00:45:39,973 --> 00:45:40,973
I think so,

868
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,675
but you can
ask me out again.

869
00:45:45,945 --> 00:45:47,079
        Hi, Terry.

870
00:45:47,147 --> 00:45:48,681
Oh, hey, Sandy.

871
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:51,250
 Hey, word's out your friend's
 desperate for a prom date.

872
00:45:51,317 --> 00:45:52,818
He would love
my cousin Jill.

873
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:54,153
She's cute.

874
00:45:55,488 --> 00:45:57,022
        How cute?

875
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,390
        Extremely.

876
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:00,693
      She's got, like,
      Joan Collins' eyes,

877
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,495
Christie Brinkley's
teeth.

878
00:46:03,563 --> 00:46:07,333
      Uh, well, what about
      the rest of her?

879
00:46:09,402 --> 00:46:11,804
     Dynamite.
     Rick has to meet her.

880
00:46:11,871 --> 00:46:14,573
     How about you and me,
     and Rick and Jill

881
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,275
all meet up at the cave tonight?

882
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:17,443
                      We'll have
                      a picnic.

883
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,544
             Uh...

884
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:22,581
Come on.
We'll have fun.

885
00:46:24,951 --> 00:46:29,154
 This Jill better be some girl.

What are you doing?

00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:57,516
                Just cleaning
                the house.

894
00:46:57,584 --> 00:46:59,218
Budster,
are you all right?

895
00:46:59,285 --> 00:47:04,656
      Huh... I am awesome.

896
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:07,326
Linda is on her way over.

897
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:09,695
      Huh, huh, huh, huh!

898
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:12,131
Excuse me, Mr. Romance,
just out of curiosity,

899
00:47:12,198 --> 00:47:13,666
does this girl
have any idea

900
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:15,601
she's coming over here
to, uh,

901
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:17,336
light up your life?

902
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:20,005
        Well, technically
        speaking, not really.

903
00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:22,574
        We'll probably start off
        with some algebra,

904
00:47:22,642 --> 00:47:27,379
 but once I turn on the charm,
 she's mine.

905
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:30,582
            Hand me that massage
            book, please.

906
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,651
Bud, why don't you
take the subtle approach?

907
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,987
You know, maybe hang
a couple of salamis

908
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:37,222
from the ceiling.

909
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,492
Hey, at least my date
is someone of the opposite sex.

910
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:45,030
I'm just seeing Sandy for Rick.

911
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:46,365
                    For Rick?

912
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:47,599
                What happened
                to research?

913
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:48,801
Well, that's
what I meant.

914
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,469
        So for research,

915
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:53,072
you're willing to toy
with this poor girl's emotions?

916
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:56,308
        All you transvestites
        are alike.

917
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:59,211
        You disgust me,

918
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:02,648
but of course, that isn't
the real problem here.

919
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:04,983
      Oh really? What is?

920
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:06,752
            Well, this Sandy
            woman's hot for you.

921
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,888
What if she suddenly goes nuts
and tears all your clothes off?

922
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:12,591
That's what Craig Garfield said
Roxanne Doyle did.

923
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:14,493
            Yeah...

924
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:15,828
    What do I do then?

925
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:16,929
            Call me.

926
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:20,833
I could be there in 15 minutes.

927
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,735
    Wait, you can't call me.

928
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:26,638
                In fact, you
                can't come home.

929
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:31,310
            You'll have to sleep
            in the cave.

930
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:33,579
        The cave.

931
00:48:33,646 --> 00:48:35,948
            Oh, God.

932
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:49,361
            I want to toast
            my good friend Rick,

933
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:52,698
              a guy with a great
              sense of humor.

934
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,933
And here's to summer.

935
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:57,703
I swear, sixth grade
is so bogus.

936
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:58,637
It's a joke.

937
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:09,281
            Want to take a walk?

938
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:11,450
            I think they need
            some privacy.

939
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:13,152
Jill...

940
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,920
You animal, you.

941
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:15,888
Come on.

942
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,961
                Hey, wait!
                Where you going?

943
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:24,997
 Hey, man, don't leave me now.

944

   <i>♪ I think I'm in trouble ♪</i>

945

    You kids have fun, huh?

946
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,674
They left me.

947
00:49:35,742 --> 00:49:37,643
                 It's okay.
                 I'm still here.

948
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:42,514
  Sandy... You tricked me bad.

949
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:43,682
                          Uh-uh.

950
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,284
                  You know,
                  in five years,

951
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:48,053
            Jill's going to make
            him very happy.

952
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:50,189
Yeah, I'm sure.

953
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:52,991
                  Nice fire.

954
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:54,026
Sandy,
this is really--

955
00:49:54,094 --> 00:49:55,127
                Shh. Don't talk.

956
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:57,563
Sandy, this is
a big mistake.

957
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,832
            Maybe, maybe not.

958
00:49:59,899 --> 00:50:01,667
                There's only one
                way to find out.

959
00:50:01,735 --> 00:50:02,701
    Sandy!

960
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:04,003
Sandy, really.

961
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,270
Sandy,
get out of there!

962
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:12,711
There really is a very
good explanation

963
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:13,712
for that.

964
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,713
                  I'm flattered.

965
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:16,548
            You are?

966
00:50:16,616 --> 00:50:17,850
                 But you don't
                 have to do this

967
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:19,118
                  to impress me.

968
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:20,185
            I don't?

969
00:50:20,253 --> 00:50:23,455
     No. I like you a lot.

970
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:26,892
    I think I'll take
    one of those beers now.

971
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
                      It's okay.

972
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:31,030
                I mean, how
                small can it be?

973
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:32,564
Don't ask.

974
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,034
                 More Cold Duck?

975
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:37,703
Sure.
Hit me again.

976
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:38,937
                If I give you
                five bucks,

977
00:50:39,005 --> 00:50:40,005
                    would you go
                    see a movie?

978
00:50:40,073 --> 00:50:41,306
Lien,
you little squirt,

979
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:43,075
Terry promised
she'd be home tonight,

980
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:44,710
and I'm not leaving
till I see her.

981
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:46,211
                If I give you
                10 bucks,

982
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:47,913
            would you go wait
            in your car?

983
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:49,882
We're on number 22.

984
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:51,750
Let's keep going.

985
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:56,488
            Bummer.

986
00:50:58,091 --> 00:50:59,692
    If the coefficient
    of X

987
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:01,060
    is greater
    than that of Y,

988
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:03,228
and the coefficient
of Y

989
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:05,097
is greater
than that C,

990
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:06,598
then by the transit
of property,

991
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:08,967
what can be said about
the coefficient of X

992
00:51:09,035 --> 00:51:10,469
         in relation to
         the coefficient of C?

993
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,016
                    Hold it!

994
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,387
                 It's time Kevin
                 knew the truth.

995
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:31,757
    Terry moved to Oregon
    to join a religious cult

996
00:51:31,825 --> 00:51:35,728
  that she saw on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

997
00:51:35,795 --> 00:51:38,197
    It's all in the letter.

998
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:42,735
         You should go home
         and wait for it, Kevin.

999
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:45,037
    Wait.
    Two more problems.

1000
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,138
If the coefficient--

1001
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:47,139
        Hi, Kevin.

1002
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:48,874
                        Terry!

1003
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:50,242
Back from the cult!

1004
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,044
 Where the hell have you been?

1005
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:57,483
          You're going to laugh.

1006
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:02,187
         I was upstairs
         looking for this skirt,

1007
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:04,890
            and I fell asleep
            in the closet.

1008
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,559
 What did you do to your hair?

1009
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:10,929
                Oh, I cut it.

1010
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:11,930
         Isn't it cute?

1011
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:13,499
        Cute? It's gone.

1012
00:52:13,566 --> 00:52:17,069
What are you,
drunk?

1013
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:20,072
     You are. You're drunk.

1014
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,940
Now, what's
going on here?

1015
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:23,409
We're supposed
to get together.

1016
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:28,714
      Kevin, honey, angel.

1017
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:33,952
    I'll make it up to you.
    I promise.

1018
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,055
When? Tonight?

1019
00:52:36,122 --> 00:52:38,190
      Let me tuck you in.

1020
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:39,458
                I can't tonight.

1021
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:44,029
     I'm working very hard
     on my article,

1022
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:45,631
but I'll tell you what...

1023
00:52:48,068 --> 00:52:50,336
            I'll walk you out
            to the car, okay?

1024
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:53,038
Gee, a walk
to the car?

1025
00:52:53,106 --> 00:52:55,274
Ta about
your wild nights, hmm?

1026
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:57,242
Don't feel bad. It's okay,

1027
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:00,245
  because while you were up
  in the closet getting drunk,

1028
00:53:00,313 --> 00:53:01,747
I got to do algebra.

1029
00:53:01,815 --> 00:53:04,116
     Oh, that's wonderful.

1030
00:53:06,419 --> 00:53:08,721
          Crazy kids.

1031
00:53:08,788 --> 00:53:11,623
            Well, alone at last.

1032
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:14,193
Why are you
smiling like that?

1033
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,928
        Because it's party time.

1034
00:53:15,995 --> 00:53:18,497
 Let's dance. Let's get crazy.

1035
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:21,266
        Let's get drunk.
        Let's get naked.

1036
00:53:21,334 --> 00:53:22,901
Buddy, I love
a good party,

1037
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:26,005
    but something about you
    worries me.

1038
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:27,172
      Linda, you're a nut.

1039
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,941
    What do you like,
    skinny dip in the pool?

1040
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:30,109
    Back rub in the bedroom?

1041
00:53:30,176 --> 00:53:31,844
      Pick a sin. Any sin.

1042
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:34,613
It's getting kind of late.

1043
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:36,648
        NoIt's early.

1044
00:53:36,716 --> 00:53:38,384
        Bye.

1045
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:40,886
        Linda, wait! For God's
        sake, I vacuumed, Linda.

1046
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,621
Buddy, you're a nice guy.

1047
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:46,325
No, not a "nice guy."
That's the kiss of death.

1048
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:48,961
    I'll see you in algebra.
    Thanks for your help.

1049
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,295
          Linda, wait.

1050
00:53:50,363 --> 00:53:52,097
     Would it make
     any difference at all

1051
00:53:52,165 --> 00:53:53,632
    if I said
    I was hung like a bear?

1052
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,468
    It might. Are you?

1053
00:53:56,536 --> 00:53:59,138
              No.

1054
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,472
                  Just checking.

1055
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,473
        Goodbye, Buddy.

1056
00:54:04,044 --> 00:54:05,878
    I like your hair.

1057
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:13,652
That girl had incredible
self-control.

1058
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,655
                 Kevin hates me.
                 Rick hates me.

1059
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:19,491
              Everybody hates me
              except Sandy.

1060
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:22,361
Oh, yeah, how'd it go?
Did you get laid?

1061
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,830
      I bet I came closer
      than you did.

1062
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:26,765
Years from now,

1063
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:29,902
Linda'll look back on this night
and be very sorry.

1064
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:34,239
    Good night, Buddy.

1065
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:37,376
         Sorry, Spike.

1066
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:41,847
             Nothing much has
             been happening, Ma.

1067
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:43,782
         Yeah, I did pretty good
         on my history test.

1068
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,684
                  Terry's become
                  a transsexual.

1069
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:48,354
         Yeah, she's starting to
         grow hair on her chest.

1070
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:49,521
            Yeah, just a second.

1071
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:50,723
                 Hey, Mom wants
                 to talk to you.

1072
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,257
No, no.

1073
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:54,893
                Uh, she can't
                talk, Mom.

1074
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:56,428
                The doctors
                have advised her

1075
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:57,663
                not to speak.

1076
00:54:57,731 --> 00:55:00,165
              Something hormonal
              and vocal.

1077
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:02,167
                Besides,
                she's hung over.

1078
00:55:02,235 --> 00:55:04,536
         Yeah, she was out
         drinking with the guys.

1079
00:55:04,604 --> 00:55:07,072
                Okay, see you
                in a week.

1080
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,241
                We miss you too.

1081
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:11,443
                      Okay. Bye.

1082
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:13,579
                  She thought
                  I was kidding.

1083
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:17,049
        Yo, Rick!

1084
00:55:19,252 --> 00:55:20,486
Hi, Terry.

1085
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:21,920
                Good morning,
                Mrs. Morehouse.

1086
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:23,355
Rick, your friend
Terry's here.

1087
00:55:31,097 --> 00:55:32,297
                     Sorry about
                     last night.

1088
00:55:32,365 --> 00:55:33,732
    Hey, that's okay.

1089
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,034
  If I was in the sixth grade,

1090
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:37,102
I think I would've
had a big night.

1091
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,338
- Come on, we're going out.
- Let me guess.

1092
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:42,941
You got me a hot date
with Sandy's grandmother.

1093
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:43,976
             No, no, no, listen,

1094
00:55:44,044 --> 00:55:45,511
 I figured the whole thing out.

1095
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:49,448
There is nothing wrong with you
except for the way you dress.

1096
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:53,552
Terry, it took me an hour
to put this look together.

1097
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,087
Yeah, so don't try so hard
next time.

1098
00:55:55,155 --> 00:55:56,355
            Come on.

1099
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:57,656
I don't have
any money.

1100
00:55:57,724 --> 00:56:00,125
      I got plastic.
      You can pay me back.

1101
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,898
I just feel kind of weird.

1102
00:56:05,965 --> 00:56:08,233
    That's because your
    body's not used to style.

1103
00:56:08,301 --> 00:56:10,536
                  You'll adjust.

1104
00:56:10,603 --> 00:56:11,904
                 Hey, Deborah,
                 what's shaking?

1105
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:13,572

                  wrong for him.

    No. She's trouble.

1382

I guess Rick needs someone

     when I have Kevin?

Good question, but...
Do you like him?

Rick's not my type at all.

     Sure, with my help,
     he's come a long way.

 He stopped buying his clothes
 at Nerds 'R' Us.

1787
01:30:57,323 --> 01:30:59,024
Hey, no problem.

1788
01:30:59,092 --> 01:31:01,560
        Just a couple of nice,
        clean, all-American kids

1789
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:03,162
         experimenting with sex.

1790
01:31:03,229 --> 01:31:04,663
             You remember Sandy,
             the fish girl?

1791
01:31:04,731 --> 01:31:05,698
      Hi.

1792
01:31:05,765 --> 01:31:07,166
             Hello.

1793
01:31:09,469 --> 01:31:11,303
                TERRY: You know,

1794
01:31:11,371 --> 01:31:13,272
            my voyage of
            self-discovery...

1795
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:17,609
     Has ended in despair.

1796
01:31:17,677 --> 01:31:19,611
                 Hey, that's
                 so interesting.

1797
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:20,979
                     Really.

1798
01:31:21,047 --> 01:31:22,681
          Could you shut
          the light off, please?

1799
01:32:14,534 --> 01:32:16,735
             I'm seeing Julian
             again this weekend.

1800
01:32:16,803 --> 01:32:19,138
                  He is so cool.

1801
01:32:19,205 --> 01:32:21,774
        I can't believe
        I finally lucked out.

1802
01:32:21,841 --> 01:32:24,610
Denise, he is
the lucky one.

1803
01:32:24,678 --> 01:32:26,278
Hey, Terry,

1804
01:32:26,346 --> 01:32:27,913
is it true
you broke up

1805
01:32:27,981 --> 01:32:29,815
with that
college guy?

1806
01:32:29,883 --> 01:32:31,250
        It's true.

1807
01:32:31,317 --> 01:32:33,452
You want to go out
Saturday night?

1808
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,988
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I'm really not ready.

1809
01:32:36,056 --> 01:32:37,089
                Well, what
                about Sunday?

1810
01:32:37,157 --> 01:32:38,891
                You think that's
                enough time?

1811
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:42,528
      No. Thanks.

1812
01:32:42,595 --> 01:32:45,364
            Terry, you have
            to snap out of this.

1813
01:32:45,432 --> 01:32:47,032
    I will.

1814
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,301
It just may take me
a couple of years.

1815
01:32:50,537 --> 01:32:52,137
Terry?

1816
01:32:52,205 --> 01:32:54,373
I really liked
your article.

1817
01:32:54,441 --> 01:32:55,441
Especially the part

1818
01:32:55,508 --> 01:32:56,809
about how
you can be cool

1819
01:32:56,876 --> 01:32:59,478
even though if you don't
dress cool and stuff.

1820
01:32:59,546 --> 01:33:02,081
I feel the same way.

1821
01:33:02,148 --> 01:33:04,850
You want to go out
sometime?

1822
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:10,155
                Oh... I'm really
                not ready yet,

1823
01:33:10,223 --> 01:33:12,424
              but thanks anyway.

1824
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:19,331
Shelley,
wait up.

1825
01:33:22,235 --> 01:33:23,702
                     Terry!

1826
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:26,205
                Can you come
                in here, please?

1827
01:33:26,272 --> 01:33:28,207
        Mr. Raymaker...

1828
01:33:28,274 --> 01:33:30,476
Come on
into my office.

1829
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:43,989
             I read your article
             in the <i>Sun-Tribune.</i>

1830
01:33:44,057 --> 01:33:45,691
                 Congratulations
                 on winning.

1831
01:33:45,759 --> 01:33:46,725
Thanks.

1832
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:48,927
    It was real good,

1833
01:33:51,564 --> 01:33:53,465
 and I'm sorry I misjudged you.

1834
01:33:53,533 --> 01:33:55,200
You don't have
to apologize.

1835
01:33:55,268 --> 01:33:58,537
    I wouldn't have this job
    if it weren't for you.

1836
01:33:58,605 --> 01:34:00,906
 I mean, you forced me to fight
 for what I wanted,

1837
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:02,174
  and I will never forget you

1838
01:34:02,242 --> 01:34:04,643
for that.

1839
01:34:04,711 --> 01:34:06,979
      Thank you.
      I learned a lot too.

1840
01:34:12,419 --> 01:34:14,486
 What about that kid
 you wrote the article about...

1841
01:34:15,622 --> 01:34:16,822
                        Rick?

1842
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:18,524
          He hates me.

1843
01:34:18,591 --> 01:34:21,393
     Well, that's too bad.

1844
01:34:21,461 --> 01:34:22,861
You really like him, don't you?

1845
01:34:22,929 --> 01:34:25,764
      Why do you say that?

1846
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,901
      I read your article.

1847
01:34:44,184 --> 01:34:45,551
      Don't worry.
      I'm a stunt driver.

1848
01:34:45,618 --> 01:34:47,486
    I do this for a living.

1849
01:34:51,091 --> 01:34:53,092
                Swift parking
                job, Bud,

1850
01:34:53,159 --> 01:34:54,593
                and you're late.

1851
01:34:54,661 --> 01:34:56,495
Yeah, I ran out
of gas,

1852
01:34:56,563 --> 01:34:58,697
but don't worry,
I put a buck's worth in...

1853
01:34:58,765 --> 01:34:59,631
             on me.

1854
01:35:02,736 --> 01:35:04,136
      Terry, it's summer.
      Smile.

1855
01:35:04,204 --> 01:35:07,306
                My face hurts
                when I smile.

1856
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:10,075
Listen to me,
oh, sister of my loins,

1857
01:35:10,143 --> 01:35:11,777
I've got
a driver's license

1858
01:35:11,845 --> 01:35:13,245
and a sex life.

1859
01:35:13,313 --> 01:35:14,680
You've got the job
of your dreams

1860
01:35:14,748 --> 01:35:15,781
and a chauffeur.

1861
01:35:15,849 --> 01:35:17,249
Life is sweet.

1862
01:35:17,317 --> 01:35:18,484
Let's get
an ice cream.

1863
01:35:20,653 --> 01:35:23,789
Uh, it's, uh,
for you.

1864
01:35:28,361 --> 01:35:29,661
You look very good in a dress...

1865
01:35:31,164 --> 01:35:33,032
Very good.

1866
01:35:38,004 --> 01:35:39,171
    I thought you hated me.

1867
01:35:41,107 --> 01:35:42,641
         I missed you.

1868
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:46,445
I read your article.

1869
01:35:46,513 --> 01:35:48,781
         Do you, uh...

1870
01:35:48,848 --> 01:35:50,249
    still feel the same way
    about me?

1871
01:35:54,187 --> 01:35:55,154
      Yeah, I guess I do.

1872
01:35:59,225 --> 01:36:01,393
 Well, hey, why don't we go out
 and have some fun?

1873
01:36:01,461 --> 01:36:03,328
        You know, like, maybe
        we could go dancing

1874
01:36:03,396 --> 01:36:04,596
         Friday night.

1875
01:36:04,664 --> 01:36:06,965
Wait a minute.

1876
01:36:07,033 --> 01:36:08,133
I'm the guy here.

1877
01:36:08,201 --> 01:36:11,170
Let me just
try this, okay?

1878
01:36:11,237 --> 01:36:14,873
Why don't we go out
dancing Friday night?

1879
01:36:14,941 --> 01:36:18,444
          What an original idea.

1880
01:36:18,511 --> 01:36:20,446
            Hey, you want
            to go for a ride?

1881
01:36:20,513 --> 01:36:21,447
Yeah.

1882
01:36:21,514 --> 01:36:22,614
                        Come on.

1883
01:36:22,682 --> 01:36:24,883
As long as
I get to drive.

1884
01:36:33,326 --> 01:36:34,560
                 Come on, Buddy!
