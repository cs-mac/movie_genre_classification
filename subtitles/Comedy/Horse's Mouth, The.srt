1
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,445
Hello, admitting.

2
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:46,725
This is Saperstein.
Where is he?

3
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:50,325
He's cleared admitting?

4
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:53,565
Right. Bring him in.

5
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:04,485
He's coming.

6
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:06,165
Good, good.

7
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,125
Trent?

8
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:17,765
John J.

9
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:19,925
Put him in number nine.

10
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,685
You son of a bitch!

11
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,605
Hang on to him.

12
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:41,725
Get him in there!

13
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,845
No, not me!

14
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,725
No, wait, wait!

15
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,045
This is wrong.

16
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,125
Look, I'm sorry about the balls!

17
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:52,565
It was a lucky shot, that's all!

18
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:54,405
Wait!

19
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:08,805
I'm not insane.

20
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,005
You hear me?

21
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,205
I'm not insane!

22
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,445
I'm not if he's not!

23
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:18,845
Me neither!

24
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:24,245
I'm not insane!

25
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:10,485
We've only just begun

26
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:13,525
Not the Carpenters, too.

27
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:20,125
So let me go

28
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:03,685
This is a rotten way to end it.

29
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:05,125
This is not the ending.

30
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:06,565
You haven't read it yet.

31
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:35,525
All right.

32
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:36,885
Came in this afternoon?

33
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:39,725
Yes. How did you
get here so fast?

34
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:41,285
We've been monitoring
all admissions...

35
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:42,645
through police
and paramedic channels.

36
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:43,765
This one fit the symptoms.

37
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:47,445
Do you think he's one of them?

38
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:48,965
Mr. Saperstein, I promise you...

39
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:50,645
that's what I'm here
to find out.

40
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:53,085
Things must be getting
pretty bad out there...

41
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:54,765
to bring youfellas in.

42
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:56,885
Is this it?

43
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,565
Did he make any requests?

44
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,725
Just...

45
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,045
one.

46
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,165
A, uh...

47
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:08,045
single black crayon.

48
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,285
Hang on.

49
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:37,925
What's up?

50
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,925
My name is Dr. Wrenn...

51
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,885
and I am going to try
and get you out of here.

52
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,605
After all my redecorating?

53
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:49,845
No. I think I'll stay.

54
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:52,445
There's a guard with a pair
of swollen testicles...

55
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:54,645
who swears you wanted
out of here.

56
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:58,245
I, uh, well...

57
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,405
I've changed my mind.

58
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:02,685
I see.

59
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,725
The crosses are a nice touch.

60
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:08,685
They'd almost have
to keep you in here...

61
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:12,245
once they'd seen these,
wouldn't they, John?

62
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,805
Got a smoke?

63
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:30,205
You're waiting to hear
about my "them," aren't you?

64
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:31,525
Your what?

65
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:34,605
My "them."

66
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:37,685
Every paranoid schizophrenic
has one...

67
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,605
a "them," a "they," an "it."

68
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:44,245
And you want to hear
about my "them," don't you?

69
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,205
I want to know how you got here.

70
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:53,245
Things are turning to shit
out there, aren't they?

71
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,925
Let's talk about you.

72
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,245
Your dime.

73
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:05,005
I'm, uh...

74
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:09,365
I was an insurance investigator,
freelance.

75
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,805
Checked outfunny claims,
frauds...

76
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,765
the usual kind of thing.

77
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,725
And lately I'd been working
for a firm here in the city.

78
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:25,365
And all of this started
with the disappearance.

79
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,525
The Sutter Cane...

80
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:30,045
disappearance.

81
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,605
It's a little hot in here,
isn't it?

82
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:39,925
It's boiling.

83
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:43,245
How long I gotta be here?

84
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:45,205
I mean, uh...

85
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,445
I took care
of all that paperwork.

86
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,405
The check was supposed
to be here three weeks ago.

87
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:51,925
Right? Isn't that right?

88
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,885
Well, usually, yeah,
that's the way it goes...

89
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:57,365
but I just have a few final
questions about the fire.

90
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:58,485
More questions.

91
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,045
I've answered
all your questions.

92
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,165
Enough's enough.

93
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:03,885
It was supposed
to be cut and dried.

94
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,725
We'll be out of here
in a minute.

95
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,245
See, Robby here,
he owns the company.

96
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:11,285
And he's hired me to see that
things go smoothly, understand?

97
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:14,045
It's just a little thing,
but, see...

98
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,005
Robby takes the view
that it was you...

99
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:19,085
who burned down your own
warehouse on Northern Boulevard.

100
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,885
Me? That's horseshit.

101
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:22,325
That was all my own stuff
in that warehouse.

102
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:23,445
That's my whole life.

103
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:26,205
Believe me, I sympathize.

104
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,925
You're really starting to sweat.

105
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:30,005
Shall I turn on
the air conditioning?

106
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:31,445
Oh, no, I'm fine.

107
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:32,885
- You sure?
- Yeah.

108
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,085
I'm running a little late.

109
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:38,205
Supposed to pick up my wife.

110
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,405
Oh, yeah, your wife.

111
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:42,165
She's a great lady.

112
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:45,045
You know her?

113
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,925
No, not really.
We just met briefly.

114
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:50,965
You know, when I went round
to check up on your story.

115
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,205
We have these photographs...

116
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:56,045
of your wife
tooling around town...

117
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,325
wearing various articles...

118
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:00,165
that you claim
were destroyed in the fire.

119
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:03,245
No, that's impossible.

120
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,925
No, this is all stuff
I boughtfor her myseif.

121
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,565
See, the problem is...

122
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:12,925
when I went round
to talk to her...

123
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,085
it turned out she knew much more
than she thought she did.

124
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:17,685
Especially...

125
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:22,765
Especially after I showed her
pictures of Miss Palminteri...

126
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:24,285
who appears to be wearing...

127
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:26,125
even more
of your destroyed articles.

128
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:30,125
Miss Palminteri?

129
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:33,925
Miss Rosa Palminteri.

130
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,965
A word of advice.

131
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:41,925
You want to pull a scam,
don't make your wife a partner.

132
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,925
If you do...

133
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:46,885
don'tfuck around
behind her back.

134
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:50,885
Trent, beautiful.

135
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:54,845
Everybody says you got the best
nose for a con in the business.

136
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,845
But to see itfirsthand, I mean,
to watch you work...

137
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,165
is incredible.

138
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:00,445
Well, it wasn't hard, Robby.

139
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:03,125
The guy's wife liked me.

140
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:04,845
Besides, he was an amateur.

141
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,245
It's too easy with amateurs.

142
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,365
You try to figure out who's
professional and who isn't.

143
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:13,165
That's when it gets fun,
when you run into a pro.

144
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:15,685
You know, most of my salesmen...

145
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,645
couldn't sniff out
a phony claim...

146
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:20,045
if their noses
were nailed to it, but you...

147
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,965
man, you never miss.

148
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:23,125
What's to miss?

149
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,565
You learn to expect the worst
in people, and you get it.

150
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,485
Everyone's looking
to play an angle.

151
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:31,045
I'm always there
to clean up the mess.

152
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,285
I'll tell you what.

153
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:35,125
You stop freelancing,
join my staff.

154
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,925
I'll make it worth your while.

155
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:38,925
Forget it, Robby.

156
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,325
I'm my own man.
Nobody pulls my strings.

157
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:42,645
I'm independent, I'm happy.

158
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:45,125
Well, be my man one more time.

159
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:47,885
I'm having quite
a difficult mess with Arcane.

160
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:49,045
The publishing house?

161
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,805
Yeah, my biggest account.

162
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:54,845
They justfiled a claim
that cost me millions.

163
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:56,765
I want you on this right away.

164
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:57,845
What's the claim?

165
00:12:57,885 --> 00:12:59,325
Sutter Cane is missing.

166
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:00,565
Who?

167
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:01,805
Sutter Cane.

168
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,125
Do you read Sutter Cane?

169
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,525
What?

170
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,125
Horror writer Sutter Cane...

171
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:50,045
a harmless pop phenomenon...

172
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,885
or a deadly mad prophet
of the printed page?

173
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:56,365
This was the scene today
outside several city bookstores.

174
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:57,685
Police believe
the riots began...

175
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:00,125
because the stores
could not meet the demand...

176
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:03,525
for advance orders
of Sutter Cane's latest novel...

177
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:05,285
'In the Mouth of Madness."

178
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:07,765
When does fiction
become religion?

179
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:09,525
And are his fans dangerous?

180
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,605
Only if you count axes.

181
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,045
In related news, there were
eighteen other stores...

182
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,845
Mr. Harglow will see you now.

183
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,005
Thank you.

184
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,805
You're not listening to me.
I needed it yesterday.

185
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:37,885
If you wait any longer, it'll be
all over the front page.

186
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:39,005
Get it done!

187
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,965
Jackson Harglow, Mr. Trent.
I'm pleased to meet you.

188
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:44,205
It's a pleasure.

189
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,325
Excuse the commotion.

190
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:48,605
We have something
of a crisis going on.

191
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,205
Everybody out now, please.

192
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:52,045
I need time with Mr. Trent.

193
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,325
Have Sylvia hold the calls,
and you get Linda in here.

194
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:57,925
That was great.
I almost left myseif.

195
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:59,605
Sit down, please.

196
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,645
I am a little short
on patience these days.

197
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:07,125
So, Mr. Trent,
are youfamiliar with Arcane?

198
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:08,325
Well, aside from the fact...

199
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:10,365
that you're insured
by the company I work for...

200
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:11,925
I never heard of Arcane.
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:13,405
You read books?

202
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:20,365
Linda Styles, John Trent.

203
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:23,485
Linda reads books for a living.
She's one of our best editors.

204
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:24,605
Since she joined the firm...

205
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,325
she's been handling
Sutter Cane exclusively.

206
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:30,845
Isn't he the guy
that writes that horror crap?

207
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:32,645
Maybe he's too sophisticated
for you.

208
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,045
Sutter Cane happens to be...

209
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,245
this century's
most widely read author.

210
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,165
You can forget
about Stephen King.

211
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,925
Cane outsells them all.

212
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,005
So what happened
to this cash cow of yours?

213
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:45,805
Cane disappeared two months ago
without a trace.

214
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:49,245
The police
have turned up nothing.

215
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,925
Who was the last person
to hearfrom him?

216
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,045
His agent.

217
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,645
Cane mailed him
several chapters...

218
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,725
of his new book,
oh, not two weeks ago.

219
00:15:56,805 --> 00:16:00,405
Plain brown wrapper.
No return address.

220
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:06,165
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.
You don't mind, do you?

221
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,565
What'd the agent have to say?

222
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:17,165
You heard what he had to say.

223
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:19,085
What are you talking about?

224
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:21,045
I understand you were there...

225
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:24,285
when the poor man went crazy
in midtown Manhattan.

226
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,645
You witnessed the shooting,
I believe.

227
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,845
That lunatic with the ax?
That was Cane's agent?

228
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,805
Hard to believe, isn't it?

229
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:35,925
Yeah, well, you'd think a guy
that outsells Stephen King...

230
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,605
couldfind
better representation.

231
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:41,205
Excuse me.

232
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,165
It's just a little joke.

233
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,365
Well, we're not in the mood.

234
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:58,805
I'll see you out, Mr. Trent.

235
00:16:58,845 --> 00:16:59,925
Thank you.

236
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,685
Cane is a billion-dollar
franchise.

237
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,285
He's the tent pole
to this company.

238
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:05,685
We've already sold the film
rights to his new book...

239
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,605
as well as publication rights
in eighteen languages...

240
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:10,245
The book you can'tfind?

241
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,885
Well, his agentfound it,
at least part of it.

242
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,445
You think he took one look
at this latest work of art...

243
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:17,685
and went ax-happy
in broad daylight?

244
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:18,685
I think it's great.

245
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:21,085
It's great promotion for Arcane,
great publicity.

246
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:22,965
This was not a publicity stunt.

247
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:24,125
You were there.

248
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,605
Cane's writing has been known
to have an effect...

249
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:28,245
on his less stable readers.

250
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:29,525
An effect? Like what?

251
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:32,085
Well, disorientation,
memory loss...

252
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,285
severe paranoid reaction.

253
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:35,805
People pay money
to feel like that? It's cute.

254
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:37,725
Put it in the press kit.

255
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:39,965
We need you.

256
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:43,445
OK. Well, why don't you and I
get together after work?

257
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,245
We'll go through his files.

258
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,605
I don't think so.

259
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:50,485
I need to see his contracts,
papers, you know.

260
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:52,765
Impossible.
His agent was a total buffer.

261
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:55,525
We don't even know
where Cane lives.

262
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,605
What do you know?

263
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,285
For about a year
before he disappeared...

264
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,965
his work became erratic,
bent, more bizarre than usual.

265
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:05,845
He became convinced his writing
was real, notfiction.

266
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,805
Then the work stopped coming.

267
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,085
I need to know
if he's alive or dead.

268
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:11,205
And I need that book.

269
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:13,285
We've delayed publication
as long as we can.

270
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:15,445
His fans are getting
really restless.

271
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,125
This shit really sells,
doesn't it?

272
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:20,085
More than you'd imagine.
Surprised?

273
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:23,525
Lady, nothing surprises me.

274
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:26,445
We fucked up the air, the water,
we fucked up each other.

275
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,005
Why don't we finish the job...

276
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,565
by justflushing our brains
down the toilet?

277
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,285
Why don't you try
reading his stuff?

278
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:35,165
See if you can get it.

279
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,485
Got any on tape?

280
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:17,805
You want some, too, buddy?

281
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:19,285
No, relax, Robby.

282
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:22,205
Look, it's a scam,
of course it's a scam.

283
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:23,605
You see...

284
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,805
all this strange behaviorfrom
people that read the books...

285
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:28,325
and the agent
going nuts and so on...

286
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:31,565
I figure it's like
mass hysteria, you know?

287
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,365
It's like, um,
it's a pop phenomenon.

288
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:35,845
It's a craze. It'll pass.

289
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,445
It's this year's Hula-Hoop.
Something like that.

290
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,845
Yeah, my God, it's freaky.

291
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:44,765
No, it's a setup.

292
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:47,085
I just have to work out
how it's set up.

293
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,205
It's just a matter of time.

294
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:50,405
You, too?

295
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:54,005
God, I've had heartburn,
tell me about it.

296
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:57,645
Sporadic riots continue
to hit Eastern cities...

297
00:19:57,725 --> 00:20:00,405
and reports of violence
from Boston and Philadelphia...

298
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:02,165
are now coming in.

299
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:05,765
Police continue to describe
barely coherent witnesses...

300
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:06,965
all reporting having read...

301
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:09,685
horror novelist
Sutter Cane's latest novel...

302
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:11,365
'Hobb's End Horror."

303
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:13,565
Many officers have been
physically attacked...

304
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:16,405
and more than
three hundred eighty people...

305
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:19,485
male andfemale, have been
jailed in New York County.

306
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,885
Two officers in Boston
were hacked to death...

307
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:25,525
amid jeering crowds
in an attack last night.

308
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:30,285
What is this horrible,
unexplainable madness...

309
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:32,085
that is gripping our lives?

310
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,685
What in the world is happening?

311
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:35,085
I can see.

312
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:37,325
Now we have an editorial...

313
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,805
Excuse me?

314
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:41,365
He sees you.

315
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,445
Great. Uh...

316
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:47,125
Tell him I say hi.

317
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:00,965
Oh, hi, Robby. Yeah.
Yeah, not a lot.

318
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,405
I picked up some of
these Sutter Cane books.

319
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:04,805
I've been reading them.

320
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:06,005
Well, it...

321
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:08,205
Pulp horror novels.
They're all pretty familiar.

322
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:09,965
They all seem
to have the same plot.

323
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:11,765
Slimy things in the dark,
people go mad...

324
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,165
they turn into monsters.

325
00:21:13,245 --> 00:21:16,045
The funny thing is that they're
kind of better written...

326
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,365
than you'd expect.

327
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:18,845
They sort of get to you
in a way.

328
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,765
I don't know
if it's his style of writing...

329
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:23,285
or his use of description
or whatever, but...

330
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:26,805
No, don't be silly.

331
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:47,605
Do you want some, too, buddy?

332
00:22:50,965 --> 00:22:53,005
He sees you.

333
00:22:58,845 --> 00:22:59,965
What?

334
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:22,725
Aw, it's just too weird.

335
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,325
Beautiful.

336
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:06,605
Where'd you go?

337
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:12,045
Assuming you went somewhere.

338
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:29,565
Cute.

339
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:33,245
Now I know why Cane
had the artwork done himseif.

340
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,965
See this?
It's a map.

341
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:37,725
The red dot is Hobb's End.

342
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:39,365
It's not on any real map,
but look at this.

343
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:42,005
The two line up.

344
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,285
Like it or not...

345
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,805
Cane's book covers
place Hobb's End...

346
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:47,485
right in the middle
of New England.

347
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:50,045
So you're saying the man
went someplace fictional?

348
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,005
It's a real place
in a real state.

349
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,325
New Hampshire, to be precise.

350
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:55,885
But it's not on the map.

351
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:59,245
Well, not on any new ones,
but maybe on some old ones.

352
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:02,965
There's plenty of forgotten
towns across America.

353
00:26:03,005 --> 00:26:04,885
Makes a great contest,
doesn't it?

354
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,405
Put the pieces together,
find the town...

355
00:26:06,485 --> 00:26:08,485
win a Sutter Cane lunchbox.

356
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:11,685
How can you be sure he's there?

357
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:15,325
Well, I'd have to go to be sure.

358
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,645
You sure you want me to go?

359
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:19,685
I'm not suggesting
that you're lying...

360
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:21,645
that you're about to file
a fraudulent claim...

361
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:23,765
butforgive me if this sounds...

362
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:26,205
a little bit
like bullshit to me.

363
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,605
And if you're telling
the truth...

364
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,125
if you really want
your author back...

365
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:31,005
if you really want your book...

366
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:33,125
then maybe it's in both
our best interests...

367
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,085
if I go find him.

368
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:38,085
We have nothing to hide,
Mr. Trent.

369
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,685
I desire only ourfair share
if Cane is dead...

370
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,125
or our property if he's alive.

371
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:45,605
Since I assume you also
have nothing to hide...

372
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,805
I'm sure you won't mind
if I send Miss Styles along...

373
00:26:48,885 --> 00:26:50,285
on your expedition.

374
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,605
Well, it's your party.

375
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:02,005
America, the

376
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,165
Beautiful

377
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:15,285
From sea to

378
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:19,725
Shining

379
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,685
Who is it? What?

380
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:31,725
You're awake.

381
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,565
Couldn't you just shake me,
you asshole?

382
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:39,205
What did I do?

383
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:43,445
We're lost.

384
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:48,725
We are lost because there
is no such place as Hobb's End.

385
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:49,885
Well, we'll see.

386
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:53,405
Never, never, never...

387
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,045
throw chips at a driver.

388
00:27:57,565 --> 00:27:59,565
God damn it. Shit.

389
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,725
Asshole.

390
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,045
Styles, can I ask you something?

391
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:12,725
Do you really like working
on Cane's stuff?

392
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:15,085
Do you really like
busting people?

393
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:17,565
Yeah. I bustfrauds,
I bust phonies...

394
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:18,845
and, yeah, I love it.

395
00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:21,325
Have you ever busted
anyone you know?

396
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:23,045
Yeah, sure I did.

397
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,365
Didn't make any difference.

398
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:27,245
You see, in my business,
you soon find out...

399
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:29,205
that anybody's
capable of anything.

400
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:31,805
If you can think of it,
they've done it.

401
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:33,725
Doesn't leave you much
to believe in.

402
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:35,205
Yeah.
But think of the upside...

403
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:37,645
it doesn't leave you much
to be disappointed in, either.

404
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,725
Believe me, the sooner we're off
the planet, the better.

405
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:43,485
Now you sound like Cane.

406
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:45,325
No, not me.

407
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:47,565
You're the Cane lover.

408
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:49,685
I just like being scared.

409
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:51,325
Cane's work scares me.

410
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:52,605
What's to be scared about?

411
00:28:52,685 --> 00:28:54,485
It's not like it's real
or anything.

412
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,925
It's not real
from your point of view...

413
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:57,925
and right now reality
shares your point of view.

414
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,245
What scares me
about Cane's work...

415
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,565
is what might happen if reality
shared his point of view.

416
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:04,885
Whoa. We're not talking
about reality here.

417
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:07,165
We're talking aboutfiction.
It's different, you know.

418
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,485
A reality is just what
we tell each other it is.

419
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:12,845
Sane and insane could
easily switch places...

420
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,325
if the insane were
to become the majority.

421
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:18,165
You wouldfind yourseif
locked in a padded cell...

422
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:21,805
wondering what happened
to the world.

423
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,005
No, that wouldn't happen to me.

424
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:25,965
It would if you realized...

425
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:28,805
everything you ever knew
was gone.

426
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:32,765
It'd be pretty lonely
being the last one left.

427
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:38,805
Not only in Manhattan proper...

428
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:41,285
but there was that incident
in Long Island...

429
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:42,525
that was also related to it.

430
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:45,645
Come on, I don't buy this.
I mean, what are you saying?

431
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:46,645
That there's some kind
of disease...

432
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:48,045
that's spreading
across the country?

433
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,805
It is an addiction
that people have at this time...

434
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:54,005
fantasy-creating
out of the written material.

435
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:55,885
How could it be addicting?

436
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:58,045
Look, I mean this is words.

437
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:11,765
Or just something
that is created by the press?

438
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:15,325
No. I think it's acting stupid
is what it is.

439
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:43,445
Jesus Christ.

440
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:46,645
I saw a...

441
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:49,605
A cow, a sheep, a pig?
What'd you see?

442
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:52,045
Never mind.
It was nothing.

443
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,205
Good.

444
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:23,005
Don't move him!

445
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:24,125
Is he alive?

446
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:25,525
I don't know.

447
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:26,965
Just don't move.

448
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:28,565
He'll get a blanket,
so lie still.

449
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,125
I can't get out.

450
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:31,285
Don't move.

451
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:33,725
They won't let me out.

452
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:58,925
He was OK?

453
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,405
Come on, let's go.

454
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:09,765
We'll tell the cops
when we hit the next town.

455
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:10,965
You OK?

456
00:33:46,365 --> 00:33:47,965
Oh, I can't believe it.

457
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:50,845
I must have slept
through the whole night.

458
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,405
Hey, thanks for driving.

459
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:56,485
What is it?

460
00:33:56,565 --> 00:33:57,725
Look.

461
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,085
Styles, you're fantastic.
Youfound it.

462
00:34:05,885 --> 00:34:07,005
What's wrong?

463
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:10,005
You drive.

464
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:56,965
Cute, cute, cute.

465
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:00,645
Main Street, USA.

466
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:05,885
Jesus.

467
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:17,365
Antiques.

468
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:24,565
Look at this old crap.

469
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:27,045
I wonder where they
manufacture this shit.

470
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,285
Look.

471
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:46,005
Those kids.

472
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,485
You didn't see them?

473
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:51,205
Where is everyone?

474
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:52,805
It's like the place
is picture perfect...

475
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,565
and there's nobody around.

476
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:56,325
Come on.

477
00:36:33,205 --> 00:36:34,885
Styles, how'd you know
about this place?

478
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:37,565
I thought you'd never
been here before.

479
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,885
I haven't.
I've read about it.

480
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,045
So have you.

481
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:44,685
This is empty now.

482
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:47,565
It used to be filled
with strange growing things...

483
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:48,725
remember?

484
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:51,445
One night, the townspeople
saw something moving in here...

485
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:55,125
something enormous,
with arms like snakes.

486
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,885
'Hobb's End Horror."

487
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:01,405
The hotelfrom...

488
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,445
'Hobb's End Horror."

489
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:05,805
Styles,
you know what I'm thinking?

490
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:08,365
There's gotta be a great
tie-in for a town like this.

491
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:11,565
I mean, think of the tourist
potential, for instance, or...

492
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:14,485
There should be
a painting behind us.

493
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:18,325
It's nice.

494
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:20,205
There's a loose board there.

495
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:28,965
Good morning.

496
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,725
Can I help youfolks?

497
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:32,845
I certainly hope so.

498
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:34,325
We'd like a room, please.

499
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:36,125
We're on our way to Boston.

500
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:37,565
We thought we'd take a...

501
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:39,805
break in yourfamous
little town.

502
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,205
Famous?

503
00:37:41,285 --> 00:37:44,085
Yeah, what with the whole
Sutter Cane thing and all.

504
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,005
Sut-Sutter who?

505
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:49,405
Cane. We heard he came
from around here...

506
00:37:49,485 --> 00:37:51,085
and comes back to stay
once in a while.

507
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:55,045
Uh, I don't know anybody
named Cane.

508
00:37:56,485 --> 00:38:00,565
Ha. Nobody passes
through here much anymore.

509
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:02,205
Let me get you your keys.

510
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:05,045
You want me to leave a deposit
or my credit card or something?

511
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:08,405
Oh, city folk.

512
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:17,205
Miss Styles,
if that's what you saw, then...

513
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:20,045
yeah, I guess it would
be a little... unsettling.

514
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,845
I'd be a little unnerved myseif.

515
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:25,805
But regardless of what you saw,
regardless of what you think...

516
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:28,965
we are not living inside
a Sutter Cane story.

517
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:32,085
They're all in here.

518
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,805
The Mrs. Pickman
in the book is a lunatic...

519
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:39,045
who chops her husband
into coleslaw.

520
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:42,125
That sweet old thing
that we met downstairs...

521
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:44,645
isn't capable
of anything worse than...

522
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:48,405
dipping her dentures
into her husband's beer.

523
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:50,805
Trent, I know
you think this is a joke.

524
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:53,125
Just listen to me
for a second, please.

525
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,685
What if Cane's work
isn'tfiction?

526
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:58,005
Oh, for Christ's sake.

527
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:01,325
This is reality.

528
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:03,765
You hear that?

529
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:05,325
Reality.

530
00:39:05,405 --> 00:39:07,765
Now, if what you're saying
is true...

531
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:10,125
there should be
out that window...

532
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:13,565
a black Byzantine church with
two-hundred-fifty-foot spires...

533
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,565
with gold onions on the top.

534
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,725
Now, look.

535
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:20,205
You see?
Reality.

536
00:39:20,285 --> 00:39:22,965
You didn't read closely enough.

537
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:26,365
The view is from the east.

538
00:39:34,645 --> 00:39:36,725
'This place had once been
the seat of an evil...

539
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:38,285
'older than mankind...

00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:40,565
"and wider

541
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,005
"It was a place
of pain and suffering...

542
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:44,205
'beyond human understanding."

543
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:47,445
You got me reading this thing
like it's a guidebook.

544
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:49,485
"Originally,
there was an old stone church...

545

551
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:05,885
'above the front door."

552
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:12,885
'Some believe the old sanctuary

'with their sadistic
wickedness."

559
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:45,565
It's the battle for heaven.

560
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:47,125
The archangel Michael's
fighting off...

561
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:49,405
Don't tell me. "Fighting off
one of the creatures...

562
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:50,805
'from the other side," right?

563
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:53,245
A representation. The things
Cane writes are indescribable.

564
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,365
'Beyond description."

565
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:56,525
Right.
We're wasting our time.

566
00:40:56,605 --> 00:40:58,325
We ought to be asking
about Cane.

567
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,965
We'll have somebody to ask
in about two seconds.

568
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:07,925
Come on,
we have to get out of here.

569
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,005
We can't be in front
of the church, Trent.

570
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:11,445
They have guns, Trent.

571
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,885
No, I want to go back.

572
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:33,125
Give him back!

573
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:41,125
Johnny!

574
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:42,805
Johnny-boy!

575
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:02,885
Is that Cane?

576
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:35,885
Get in the truck!

577
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:40,525
Where are they comingfrom?

578
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:01,845
I see.

579
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:07,245
Tell me how you knew
about that mob!

580
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:10,525
You see, you can't bullshit
a bullshitter, can you?

581
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:11,645
'Cause I'll tell you how.

582
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:13,725
This whole thing
has been staged, that's how.

583
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,805
You, Harglow, and Cane
put me through all of this...

584
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:17,165
so I can blab to the media...

585
00:43:17,245 --> 00:43:19,045
about Cane's
haunted little town...

586
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,605
help you sell
a few more million copies.

587
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:21,805
Well, fuck that.

588
00:43:21,885 --> 00:43:23,765
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

589
00:43:23,845 --> 00:43:25,125
Before I leave
this shitty town...

590
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:26,925
I'm going to find someone
who's going to come clean...

591
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:29,085
and we're going to dismiss
your bullshit claim.

592
00:43:29,165 --> 00:43:31,445
You're wrong, Trent.
I know you are wrong.

593
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:32,565
How am I wrong?

594
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:34,965
Because you're right.
You're haif right.

595
00:43:35,005 --> 00:43:36,245
This was a hoax.

596
00:43:36,285 --> 00:43:38,405
We did send Cane away
on a publicity stunt...

597
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:39,925
only he never showed up.

598
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:42,685
Harglow sent me with you
to make it look good...

599
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:45,525
only we weren't supposed to find
anything, but we did.

600
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:48,285
That's how I know
what we're seeing is real.

601
00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:50,485
We didn't stage any of this.

602
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:52,485
It's all happening
for real, Trent.

603
00:43:52,565 --> 00:43:55,125
And it is all in that book,
and that's how I know.

604
00:43:55,205 --> 00:43:56,245
You're lying.

605
00:43:56,325 --> 00:43:57,725
I read the books, too,
you remember?

606
00:43:57,805 --> 00:43:59,965
There's nothing about any mob,
any little girl.

607
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:03,005
Not in the old books, Trent.
In the new one!

608
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:07,765
No one knew what was in it
except me and Cane's agent.

609
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:14,885
All right.

610
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:16,845
What's it about, the new one?

611
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:20,365
It's about the end
to everything...

612
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:22,485
and it starts here
in this place...

613
00:44:22,525 --> 00:44:25,405
with an evil that returns
and takes over Hobb's End...

614
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:28,725
piece by piece,
starting with the children.

615
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:31,605
It's about people
turning into things...

616
00:44:31,645 --> 00:44:33,525
creatures that aren't
human anymore.

617
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:35,645
It's fiction, Styles, fiction.

618
00:44:35,725 --> 00:44:40,125
We need to read the new book
to find the way out.

619
00:44:40,205 --> 00:44:41,645
How's that gonna help?

620
00:44:41,725 --> 00:44:44,325
We could skip to the ending.

621
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:46,605
I really hope
you're making this up...

622
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:49,445
because if you're not,
you're actually crazy.

623
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:50,965
Please, Trent.

624
00:44:52,925 --> 00:44:55,565
Don't make me do this alone,
Trent.

625
00:45:00,445 --> 00:45:02,965
Are you coming with me?

626
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:06,085
Fine.

627
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:08,965
Have a nice bus ride home.

628
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:42,125
No smoking, please.

629
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:45,245
It bothers my husband.

630
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,405
I'm sorry.

631
00:45:46,485 --> 00:45:49,045
I just can't seem to
help myseif around here.

632
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,805
I was just on my way out.

633
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:53,365
I thought I'd stop
and admire the artwork.

634
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:54,885
It's beautiful, isn't it?

635
00:45:54,965 --> 00:45:56,845
Sure is.

636
00:45:56,925 --> 00:45:59,765
Styles told me
you painted it yourseif.

637
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:07,365
You mean the pretty young thing
you came in here with?

638
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:10,925
I don't know her at all.

639
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:13,205
Does she know me?

640
00:46:13,285 --> 00:46:14,805
She claims she does.

641
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:17,725
So you're not responsible
for this?

642
00:46:17,765 --> 00:46:19,765
Hell, no.

643
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:23,245
Well, it's a nice place
you got here.

644
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:26,805
It must be a hell
of a thing to keep clean.

645
00:46:26,845 --> 00:46:29,205
You look as if you've
been up all night.

646
00:46:30,485 --> 00:46:31,605
Been reading.

647
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:02,005
Hush!

648
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:30,325
You're a writer?

649
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,085
You an actor?

650
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:37,365
Take a hint, leave.

651
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:39,125
This ain't no tourist town.

652
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:42,125
Oh, I've been trying to.

653
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:45,685
You guys are good, you know.

654
00:47:45,765 --> 00:47:47,925
You,
the old lady at the hotel...

655
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,565
Really, really good.

656
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:52,245
Cane's been messing
with the church.

657
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:55,045
Now something came leaking out,
took the little ones first...

658
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,685
then passed it on to us.

659
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,925
Can I buy you a beer?

660
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,125
Don't let it get to you.
Just get out.

661
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:18,165
Give it.

662
00:48:18,245 --> 00:48:20,205
What are you?
Where do you come from?

663
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:23,285
Where do you live?

664
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:24,805
With you.

665
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:26,285
Who takes care of you?

666
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,445
You do.

667
00:48:27,485 --> 00:48:29,485
You're my mommy.

668
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:31,605
Know what today is?

669
00:48:31,645 --> 00:48:34,365
Today is Mommy's Day.

670
00:50:59,205 --> 00:51:01,165
Nice to see you again.

671
00:51:04,765 --> 00:51:10,005
You can edit this one
from the inside, looking out.

672
00:51:14,085 --> 00:51:15,445
It's funny, isn't it?

673
00:51:15,525 --> 00:51:18,805
For years, I thought
I was making all this up.

674
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:25,325
But they were telling me
what to write...

675
00:51:35,565 --> 00:51:38,485
giving me the power
to make it all real.

676
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,045
And now it is.

677
00:51:51,805 --> 00:51:54,685
All those horrible,
slimy things...

678
00:51:54,765 --> 00:51:57,845
trying to get back in?

679
00:51:57,885 --> 00:51:59,685
They're all true.

680
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:15,245
Come.

681
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:19,085
See the instrument
of their homecoming.

682
00:52:20,325 --> 00:52:22,205
What you have come lookingfor.

683
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:24,885
The new Bible...

684
00:52:28,165 --> 00:52:30,645
that starts the change...

685
00:52:32,245 --> 00:52:34,965
helps you see.

686
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:53,005
Do you like my ending?

687
00:52:58,205 --> 00:52:59,925
Any suggestions?

688
00:53:36,365 --> 00:53:37,525
Youfound something.

689
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:39,445
Where the hell did you go?

690
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:40,885
I'm losing me, John.

691
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:42,645
Help me.
I'm losing me.

692
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,925
What's happening?

693
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,365
I saw the book.

694
00:53:47,405 --> 00:53:50,045
Don't look at it.
Don't read it, John.

695
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,885
I'm losing me!

696
00:54:07,485 --> 00:54:08,765
Mrs. Pickman!

697
00:54:36,285 --> 00:54:38,885
Come on, you old bitch.

698
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,405
We're going. Now.

699
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:51,085
You are a dead girl

700
00:56:57,005 --> 00:56:59,125
Fuck you!

701
00:57:07,325 --> 00:57:09,885
You're still here.

702
00:57:09,965 --> 00:57:12,325
Busy night.

703
00:57:12,405 --> 00:57:15,205
Special effects,
hidden speakers.

704
00:57:15,285 --> 00:57:17,845
You people are professionals,
I'll give you that.

705
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:21,525
The thing I can't remember
is what came first...

706
00:57:21,565 --> 00:57:23,085
us or the book.

707
00:57:24,605 --> 00:57:26,965
We are not living
in a Sutter Cane story!

708
00:57:27,005 --> 00:57:28,725
This is not reality!

709
00:57:30,005 --> 00:57:32,565
Reality is not
what it used to be.

710
00:57:32,605 --> 00:57:36,325
Oh, Jesus, this place
makes my head hurt.

711
00:57:36,405 --> 00:57:37,765
Oh, really?

712
00:57:37,845 --> 00:57:41,045
Come on, look at this.

713
00:57:41,085 --> 00:57:44,165
This was done
by a five-year-old...

714
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:45,685
my five-year-old.

715
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:47,245
Johnny's sister.

716
00:57:47,325 --> 00:57:49,965
She did me
after she did her mom.

717
00:57:51,765 --> 00:57:53,565
You're alone.

718
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:00,965
Shit. Don't.

719
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:03,565
I have to.
He wrote me this way.

720
00:58:34,365 --> 00:58:36,725
Oh, shit.
The key.

721
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,405
Jesus!

722
00:58:54,525 --> 00:58:55,725
Christ.

723
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:00,005
Shit.

724
00:59:25,325 --> 00:59:28,405
Never leave the city.
Why don't I learn?

725
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:30,845
Are we leaving?

726
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:33,845
We're already home.

727
00:59:33,925 --> 00:59:35,805
You should have believed me.

728
00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:38,965
Where's the fucking highway?

729
00:59:39,005 --> 00:59:41,485
Cane's writing me.
He wants me to kiss you.

730
00:59:41,565 --> 00:59:43,045
Why?

731
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,565
Because it's goodfor the book.

732
00:59:44,645 --> 00:59:45,685
Jesus!

733
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:46,965
It's what the readers
want to read.

734
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:48,085
Oh, God!

735
00:59:53,325 --> 00:59:56,405
Go! Get... get away from me!

736
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:23,805
Cane has a job for you.

737
01:01:26,685 --> 01:01:29,045
Afew bad calls.

738
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,805
Afew wrong turns.

739
01:04:05,245 --> 01:04:09,045
Do you want to know the problem
with places like this?

740
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,045
With religion in general?

741
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:15,965
It's never known how to convey
the anatomy of horror.

742
01:04:16,045 --> 01:04:18,725
Religion seeks discipline
through fear...

743
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:21,805
yet doesn't understand
the true nature of creation.

744
01:04:23,205 --> 01:04:26,845
No one's ever believed it enough
to make it real.

745
01:04:28,085 --> 01:04:30,605
The same cannot be said
of my world.

746
01:04:31,765 --> 01:04:34,485
Your books aren't real.

747
01:04:34,525 --> 01:04:37,245
But they've sold
over a billion copies.

748
01:04:37,325 --> 01:04:40,725
I've been translated
into eighteen languages.

749
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:44,405
More people believe in my work
than believe in the Bible.

750
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:49,685
You got a point?

751
01:04:56,165 --> 01:04:57,805
I think you know it.

752
01:04:58,965 --> 01:05:01,045
There has to be
some kind of an explanation...

753
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,685
for what I've seen tonight.

754
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:05,605
I'll sort this shit out later,
but right now...

755
01:05:05,685 --> 01:05:08,885
there has to be some kind of
a simple fucking explanation.

756
01:05:08,965 --> 01:05:12,525
Always lookingfor the con.

757
01:05:12,565 --> 01:05:15,805
Even now you're trying
to rationalize.

758
01:05:18,365 --> 01:05:20,565
Anyway...

759
01:05:20,645 --> 01:05:22,365
your books suck.

760
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:31,245
You must try
reading my new one.

761
01:05:31,285 --> 01:05:34,045
The others
have had quite an effect...

762
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:37,205
but this one will drive you
absolutely mad.

763
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:42,325
So I'm told.

764
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:46,045
It'll make the world ready
for the change.

765
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,325
It takes its power...

766
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:49,925
from new readers
and new believers.

767
01:05:50,005 --> 01:05:52,845
That's the point.
Belief!

768
01:05:52,885 --> 01:05:56,365
When people begin to
lose their ability...

769
01:05:56,445 --> 01:06:00,525
to know the difference
between fantasy and reality...

770
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:06,045
the old ones can begin
their journey back.

771
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:09,165
The more people who believe,
the faster the journey.

772
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:13,725
And with the way
the other books have sold...

773
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:17,605
this one is bound
to be very, very popular.

774
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:22,325
Want to see?

775
01:06:35,085 --> 01:06:36,205
All done.

776
01:06:42,805 --> 01:06:45,205
'Ln the Mouth of Madness."

777
01:06:51,965 --> 01:06:53,765
Yours to deliver, Trent.

778
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:56,245
What?

779
01:06:56,285 --> 01:06:58,885
I will be joining
my new publishers now.

780
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:06,685
You take the manuscript
back to the worldfor me...

781
01:07:06,765 --> 01:07:07,885
that's what you do.

782
01:07:07,925 --> 01:07:10,205
What I do?

783
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:15,645
You are what I write.

784
01:07:17,205 --> 01:07:19,685
Like this town.

785
01:07:19,765 --> 01:07:21,365
It wasn't here
before I wrote it.

786
01:07:21,445 --> 01:07:23,845
And neither were you.

787
01:07:27,685 --> 01:07:29,525
I know what's real.

788
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:31,725
I know what I am...

789
01:07:31,765 --> 01:07:33,405
and nobody pulls my strings.

790
01:07:35,445 --> 01:07:38,765
Did you think my agent
attacked you by accident?

791
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:42,365
He read about you...
in there.

792
01:07:42,445 --> 01:07:46,205
He knew you'd bring it back
and start the change...

793
01:07:46,285 --> 01:07:48,365
make what's happened here
happen everywhere.

794
01:07:48,405 --> 01:07:50,325
He tried to stop you.

795
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:54,005
I'm not a piece of fiction.

796
01:07:55,005 --> 01:07:57,165
I think, therefore you are.

797
01:07:59,765 --> 01:08:02,005
Read it if you don't
believe me.

798
01:08:03,285 --> 01:08:05,965
See what I have
in store for you.

799
01:08:07,965 --> 01:08:09,525
I know what I am.

800
01:08:18,645 --> 01:08:19,725
Go back.

801
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:24,485
Your world lies
beyond that passage.

802
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:36,925
Go now.

803
01:08:37,005 --> 01:08:40,165
I can't hold them back
any longer.

804
01:09:30,805 --> 01:09:33,365
"Trent stood
at the edge of the rip...

805
01:09:33,405 --> 01:09:37,725
'stared into the illimitable

01:09:57,245 --> 01:10:01,085

carrion black pit...

01:10:01,165 --> 01:10:04,045

815
01:10:04,125 --> 01:10:07,525
"of countless

817

820
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:22,285
Come with me.

821
01:10:23,925 --> 01:10:25,445
I can't.

822
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:28,085
I've read to the end.

823
01:11:41,205 --> 01:11:44,125
Hey, kid.

824
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:49,325
You want a paper?

825
01:11:56,405 --> 01:11:59,125
Have you been in an accident?

826
01:12:02,205 --> 01:12:04,125
You want me to get somebody?

827
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:07,525
No. Just...

828
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,725
Just point me to the highway.

829
01:12:11,765 --> 01:12:14,805
Straight up.

830
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,205
Hey, kid.

831
01:12:24,565 --> 01:12:26,805
Did you ever hear of Hobb's End?

832
01:13:57,085 --> 01:13:58,165
What?

833
01:13:58,245 --> 01:14:00,725
Package for you, sir.

834
01:14:00,805 --> 01:14:03,005
But nobody knows I'm here.

835
01:14:03,085 --> 01:14:05,205
Well, someone does.

836
01:14:31,645 --> 01:14:33,165
Who delivered this?

837
01:14:33,205 --> 01:14:34,445
I don't know.

838
01:14:34,485 --> 01:14:35,565
Who?!

839
01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:37,005
I don't know!
I wasn't here last night.

840
01:14:37,045 --> 01:14:38,125
Who was it?!

841
01:14:38,165 --> 01:14:40,685
I was.
And I didn't see shit.

842
01:14:59,445 --> 01:15:03,165
I remember New York
during the Depression.

843
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:06,285
They think they have it bad now.

844
01:15:06,325 --> 01:15:09,685
You should have seen
the Bowery back then.

845
01:15:09,765 --> 01:15:14,125
Bodies piled two, three feet
high off the gutter.

846
01:15:32,325 --> 01:15:34,205
I'm not going anywhere.

847
01:15:34,285 --> 01:15:37,605
I'm God now.
You understand?

848
01:15:37,685 --> 01:15:40,005
God's not supposed to be
a hack horror writer.

849
01:15:40,085 --> 01:15:43,565
But maybe
I can help you believe.

850
01:15:43,645 --> 01:15:45,365
Look around when you wake up.

851
01:15:45,445 --> 01:15:49,965
Did I ever tell you
my favorite color was blue?

852
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:11,005
Relax, buddy.

853
01:16:11,085 --> 01:16:13,005
Relax.
You're awake now.

854
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:16,005
It was just a bad dream.

855
01:16:17,685 --> 01:16:20,045
Are you deaf and dumb, sir?

856
01:16:21,805 --> 01:16:24,645
I was just there in the town...

857
01:16:24,725 --> 01:16:26,645
in that town, and...

858
01:16:26,725 --> 01:16:28,125
there were people there...

859
01:16:28,205 --> 01:16:29,725
and shops and homes and...

860
01:16:29,805 --> 01:16:31,525
I don't doubt that.

861
01:16:31,605 --> 01:16:34,005
What I'm telling you
for the tenth time...

862
01:16:34,085 --> 01:16:36,285
is that it couldn't
have been called Hobb's End.

863
01:16:36,365 --> 01:16:39,685
There never was, is,
or shall be any such place...

864
01:16:39,765 --> 01:16:41,365
by that name in this state.

865
01:16:41,445 --> 01:16:42,565
Ever.

866
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:44,885
I want to see your supervisor!

867
01:17:28,205 --> 01:17:30,205
Well...

868
01:17:30,285 --> 01:17:32,365
that is quite a story.

869
01:17:32,445 --> 01:17:34,485
If you could write it,
I'd publish it.

870
01:17:36,405 --> 01:17:38,245
You don't believe it, do you?

871
01:17:41,005 --> 01:17:42,565
If I don't, what's my option?

872
01:17:42,645 --> 01:17:45,685
That I'm crazy?

873
01:17:45,805 --> 01:17:47,405
I'm not crazy.

874
01:17:48,405 --> 01:17:50,125
Have you heard the rumors...

875
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:54,925
that Cane's books
have affected certain readers?

876
01:17:54,965 --> 01:17:57,205
Yeah. Styles told me.

877
01:17:57,285 --> 01:18:01,525
Styles... Oh, that's the girl
you say I sent with you.

878
01:18:01,605 --> 01:18:04,725
But I know I sent you off alone.

879
01:18:04,765 --> 01:18:08,165
Why wouldn't I remember her?

880
01:18:12,725 --> 01:18:14,965
Well...

881
01:18:15,005 --> 01:18:17,765
That's easy.
She was written out.

882
01:18:17,845 --> 01:18:19,365
Written out?

883
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:22,405
Look, do you think...

884
01:18:22,485 --> 01:18:25,325
those books
somehow infected you?

885
01:18:25,405 --> 01:18:27,445
Listen to me, Harglow.

886
01:18:27,525 --> 01:18:31,005
Everything I've said is true.
It's real.

887
01:18:31,085 --> 01:18:34,005
And that's why I had to destroy
the last manuscript.

888
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:36,965
But I know that's not true.

889
01:18:38,765 --> 01:18:40,085
What are you talking about?

890
01:18:40,165 --> 01:18:43,045
You delivered that manuscript
to me months ago.

891
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:46,405
To me personally in this room.

892
01:18:46,445 --> 01:18:47,485
I did?

893
01:18:47,565 --> 01:18:50,605
Yes, you did.
Last spring.

894
01:18:50,645 --> 01:18:53,485
For God's sakes,
we published in July.

895
01:18:53,525 --> 01:18:55,165
The book's been in the stores
for seven weeks.

896
01:18:57,565 --> 01:18:58,645
Have you read it?

897
01:18:58,725 --> 01:19:01,245
No.
I never read Cane's work.

898
01:19:01,325 --> 01:19:02,925
I haven't got
the stomach for it.

899
01:19:02,965 --> 01:19:05,845
Pull it.
Don't distribute it.

900
01:19:05,885 --> 01:19:08,845
Even if everything I've said
is totally Looney Tunes...

901
01:19:08,925 --> 01:19:11,565
I know this book
will drive people crazy.

902
01:19:11,605 --> 01:19:14,605
Well, let's hope so.

903
01:19:14,685 --> 01:19:16,805
The movie comes out next month.

904
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:20,365
Oh, Christ.

905
01:19:28,525 --> 01:19:30,445
The newest, and presumably
posthumous, work...

906
01:19:30,525 --> 01:19:33,845
of Sutter Cane continues
to sit at number one...

907
01:19:33,885 --> 01:19:35,405
on the best-seller list.

908
01:19:35,445 --> 01:19:37,445
'Ln the Mouth of Madness"
is expected to break...

909
01:19:37,525 --> 01:19:40,085
all previous publishing records.

910
01:19:40,205 --> 01:19:42,685
On the local scene, police
are at a loss to explain...

911
01:19:42,725 --> 01:19:46,085
the outbreak of violent crime
among the city's clergy.

912
01:19:46,165 --> 01:19:48,085
The mayor has called
an emergency meeting...

913
01:19:48,165 --> 01:19:50,325
of law enforcement
and medical agencies...

914
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:54,205
to discuss an apparent epidemic
of paranoid schizophrenia.

915
01:19:54,285 --> 01:19:56,605
Just an unbelievably
horrible story, Bob.

916
01:19:56,685 --> 01:19:58,045
What began locally...

917
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,365
has now broken out
into a global epidemic.

918
01:20:00,405 --> 01:20:02,845
An epidemic
of monumental proportions...

919
01:20:02,925 --> 01:20:06,685
of senseless, seemingly
unmotivated acts of violence.

920
01:20:08,005 --> 01:20:09,045
Like the book?

921
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:10,565
I love it.

922
01:20:10,645 --> 01:20:13,405
Good.

923
01:20:13,485 --> 01:20:15,565
Then this shouldn't
come as a surprise.

924
01:20:21,205 --> 01:20:23,445
Jeez!
I don't believe he did that!

925
01:20:31,445 --> 01:20:33,205
It's spreading out there,
isn't it?

926
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:37,525
Just because you know
the symptoms...

927
01:20:37,645 --> 01:20:39,645
doesn't mean to say
your story's true.

928
01:20:39,685 --> 01:20:42,485
It's Cane's story...

929
01:20:42,565 --> 01:20:44,405
and it'll spread
with each new reader.

930
01:20:44,485 --> 01:20:48,205
That's how it gets its power.

931
01:20:48,245 --> 01:20:52,085
What about the people
who don't read?

932
01:20:54,685 --> 01:20:56,605
There's a movie.

933
01:20:58,045 --> 01:20:59,605
Oh, yes, of course.

934
01:21:06,365 --> 01:21:07,845
I'm gonna leave now...

935
01:21:07,925 --> 01:21:10,885
but I'll be coming back,
I promise.

936
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:12,845
I want to help you.

937
01:21:12,925 --> 01:21:14,005
There's no hurry.

938
01:21:14,085 --> 01:21:16,965
It's safer in here now.

939
01:21:17,045 --> 01:21:19,885
It'll get worse out there.

940
01:21:19,965 --> 01:21:21,085
Why?

941
01:21:24,325 --> 01:21:26,965
Every species can smell
its own extinction.

942
01:21:27,045 --> 01:21:30,005
The last ones left...

943
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,245
won't have a pretty time of it.

944
01:21:32,325 --> 01:21:37,285
And in ten years, maybe less...

945
01:21:37,365 --> 01:21:40,965
the human race
will just be a bedtime story...

946
01:21:41,005 --> 01:21:42,245
for their children.

947
01:21:42,325 --> 01:21:44,925
A myth. Nothing more.

948
01:22:04,565 --> 01:22:07,245
Did he have anything to say?

949
01:22:08,365 --> 01:22:10,645
No. It was useless.

950
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:13,365
He thinks he's fiction...

951
01:22:13,405 --> 01:22:16,245
and that Sutter Cane's
causing the epidemic.

952
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:21,965
Do you read Sutter Cane?

953
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,245
Oh, God!

954
01:24:58,165 --> 01:25:00,085
I'll try and continue...

955
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:03,085
this emergency broadcast as long
as we can hold out here.

956
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:06,285
Um, the city is almost
completely deserted now.

957
01:25:06,325 --> 01:25:08,725
There are only a few stragglers
left on the streets.

958
01:25:08,765 --> 01:25:10,885
There are
no emergency services.

959
01:25:10,965 --> 01:25:14,085
The fires continue
to burn out of control.

960
01:25:14,165 --> 01:25:17,805
This incredible epidemic
of random mass killing...

961
01:25:17,845 --> 01:25:20,445
has spread to every country
in the civilized world.

962
01:25:20,525 --> 01:25:23,685
Every hour, more people
are becoming infected...

963
01:25:23,725 --> 01:25:27,285
being driven to senseless
acts of extreme violence.

964
01:25:27,285 --> 01:25:29,725
We have gotten reports,
sketchy at best...

965
01:25:29,805 --> 01:25:33,845
of people mutating, their bodies
swelling and distorting...

966
01:25:33,925 --> 01:25:36,205
changing somehow.

967
01:25:36,245 --> 01:25:39,245
Locally, the mass killings
appear to have moved inland.

968
01:25:39,285 --> 01:25:41,725
All the major cities
on the East Coast are silent.

969
01:25:41,805 --> 01:25:43,125
We lost contact
with Los Angeles...

970
01:25:43,165 --> 01:25:44,885
and the West Coast last night...

971
01:25:44,925 --> 01:25:46,765
so it's impossible
at this time to know...

972
01:25:46,805 --> 01:25:49,085
how many unaffected people
are left.

973
01:25:49,165 --> 01:25:52,125
If for any reason...

974
01:25:52,205 --> 01:25:55,045
you are one of us
who hasn't become infected...

975
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:56,725
take shelter immediately.

976
01:25:56,805 --> 01:25:58,685
Do not trust any friends
orfamily members.

977
01:25:58,765 --> 01:26:01,645
I repeat... Do not...

978
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:13,165
I'm sorry about the balls!
It was a lucky shot, that's all!

979
01:26:13,205 --> 01:26:14,645
What?!

980
01:26:14,725 --> 01:26:16,925
I am not insane.

981
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:20,285
Do you hear me?
I am not insane!

982
01:26:23,325 --> 01:26:26,165
Relax, buddy.
You're awake now.

983
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:30,405
This is not a Sutter Cane story!
This is not reality!

984
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:32,045
Not reality! Not reality!

985
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:34,485
This is reality.
