{449}{504}Some fairy tales are true.
{506}{601}Most other stories we make up|to help us deal with real life.
{602}{658}It all depends|on your point of view,
{660}{715}but here are the facts.
{717}{792}There was once a princess|who lived in a castle
{794}{869}high above the streets|of an enchanted kingdom.
{882}{928}The king and queen|were long gone,
{930}{978}but they left her|with their treasure
{980}{1053}so that she could stay|a princess forever.
{1054}{1119}On the eve|of her 22nd birthday,
{1121}{1181}a great celebration|was planned.
{1229}{1298}Molly's machine.|Speak your piece.
{1310}{1401}Oh, birthday girl,|pick up, pick up, pick up.
{1402}{1468}Huey and I|are just sitting here waiting.
{1470}{1544}You better be on your way.|- Money down she's still asleep.
{1546}{1594}Molly, wake up!
{1644}{1712}Molly's machine.|Speak your piece.
{1714}{1766}Hey, Molly, it's Justin here.
{1768}{1845}Callin' from the studio|to wish you a happy birthday...
{1846}{1929}Give me five more minutes,|baby, and I'll rock your world.
{1931}{1964}Love ya!
{3667}{3757}You can't turn the hallway|into a greenhouse, Miss Gunn.
{3758}{3806}Good evening, Mr. McConkey.
{3808}{3861}Please say hello|to your wife for me.
{3863}{3925}Bye. Have a nice night!
{3926}{3998}I've alerted the management|company about this.
{4192}{4225}Oh, my.
{4297}{4376}I put the flowers upstairs for you,|but this is out of hand.
{4378}{4409}Got a girl, Tony?
{4434}{4485}Not one that could fit|into this dental floss.
{4487}{4557}Be a darling and send all this stuff|to the Salvation Army!
{4558}{4607}You're the greatest, Tony!
{5077}{5138}Molly?|- Hey, Ingrid, it's me.
{5140}{5204}Where the hell are you?|- I'm sorry. I passed out.
{5206}{5282}I was watching TV.|- That was a premeditated nap.
{5284}{5332}You did this to me on purpose.
{5334}{5385}You're my best friend|in the whole universe.
{5387}{5437}How could you possibly think|a thing like this?
{5438}{5491}It's like stabbing me in the heart.|Thank you!
{5493}{5526}Forget it, okay?
{5528}{5589}I didn't want to tell you,|but our little night out has grown.
{5590}{5646}Huey and I are here|with a few of your closest friends
{5648}{5696}waiting to wish you a...
{5728}{5759}Happy birthday?
{5761}{5787}Happy birthday.
{5909}{5957}I tried calling you from home.
{5958}{6011}The girly to end all girlies|is in the house.
{6013}{6046}Happy birthday, Molly.
{6066}{6112}We got you, Molly!|- We got you, didn't we?
{6114}{6185}You did. I thought it was|gonna be just us guys going out.
{6187}{6249}Hell, no! What kind of friends|you think we are?
{6251}{6311}Look at this.|This here is a party, right?
{6368}{6402}You're 22?
{6403}{6472}I just turned 19|and I thought I'd kill myself.
{6474}{6540}You look good, though.|Buy you a drink?
{6542}{6569}No, thanks.
{6571}{6659}I wanna connect the dots, baby.|Look at the babes, Molly.
{6661}{6733}They're, like, beautiful|and natural and sexy, right?
{6735}{6790}Beauty like that is universal.
{6792}{6843}They really do look young, huh?
{6845}{6908}The thing I love about women|is that you are willing
{6910}{6973}to accept each other|for who you are.
{6988}{7027}There you are, sweetie.
{7029}{7096}You remember Julie and Holly|from the MOMA Junior Committee?
{7098}{7176}Happy birthday.|I love your solid hair scrunchy.
{7178}{7221}Thanks.|- Issey Miyake?
{7222}{7264}Home Depot.
{7266}{7382}You can get Botox injections|for that forehead wrinkle.
{7383}{7470}Face Factory.|No appointment necessary.
{7704}{7756}Why would I have|a worry wrinkle?
{7758}{7815}Why would you think|anyone would care?
{7869}{7909}Excuse me?
{7911}{8001}I had shoes like yours once,|when I was five.
{8135}{8189}That was what,|like three days ago?
{8190}{8240}Try three years.
{8242}{8290}Excuse me, Thumbelina,
{8292}{8380}but you're still a little underage|to be clubbing, aren't you?
{8382}{8459}You're a little overage to be|wearing a lampshade in your hair.
{8461}{8508}Bright idea?
{8589}{8641}You brought your own|personal soap?
{8656}{8726}You want to pick up|bacterial meningitis or polio,
{8727}{8775}you go ahead|and be my guest.
{8777}{8825}Whatever diseases|you're already carrying
{8826}{8887}probably make those|sound like a joke, anyway.
{8889}{8971}There you are. I finally found|your little monster butt.
{8973}{8999}Come here!
{9001}{9057}I know you have trouble|reading something as simple
{9058}{9142}as a sign on the door, Gooey Huey,|so let me help you.
{9144}{9240}This is the "ladies'" room.
{9242}{9306}Really? What's your excuse?|- Give me my purse.
{9308}{9369}My boss' kid.|They can't keep a nanny.
{9371}{9416}They fired their|third one this month today.
{9418}{9474}She had dirty fingernails.|It was her or me.
{9476}{9514}That hurts.|- Where's my purse?
{9516}{9545}In my hand.
{9598}{9653}Ing, am I hideous?|- What?
{9655}{9725}As my best friend,|it is your duty not to lie to me.
{9726}{9797}Please tell me,|am I turning into a hideous hag?
{9798}{9853}You can have any guy here|with the snap of a finger.
{9855}{9890}What's gotten into you?
{10079}{10153}Oh, my God.
{10154}{10220}Molly, let me show you something.|Come here.
{10222}{10304}Sit down.|- Great. You again.
{10306}{10361}I want to thank you all|for having me here.
{10363}{10450}I've heard there's a birthday tonight.|Where's that birthday girl?
{10553}{10633}All right.|This one's for you.
{10714}{10801}The lights beam|down from the stars
{10803}{10880}And it takes my breath away
{10882}{10985}And the tears of glee|in my heart
{10986}{11056}End up voicing words to say
{11058}{11126}All I feel is invested in this...
{11128}{11184}Oh, my God.|Who is that?
{11186}{11229}That's my boy Neal Fox.
{11231}{11284}I found him playing|at a dive in the Village.
{11286}{11321}He's smokin'.
{11323}{11371}Can I have him|for my birthday?
{11373}{11450}No, Molly, I brought him here|so Roma could check him out.
{11452}{11512}Besides, he's 100% girly free.
{11514}{11602}He's celibate, like Morrissey.|He's all about the music.
{11604}{11695}You wouldn't know real music|if Mozart hit you on the head.
{11697}{11737}Quiet, the both of you.
{11738}{11873}Quiet? This place is so loud,|it is giving me a migraine.
{11875}{11925}My call of love
{11926}{12021}Then she'll rise with love...
{12023}{12051}Mom!
{12053}{12118}No, your mom's over there|talkin' to my man Nas.
{12120}{12172}We been tryin'|to sign him for months.
{12174}{12271}Could you please keep it down?|- Mom, I wanna go home now!
{12487}{12522}Night, Molls.|- Bye.
{12524}{12563}Good night, Molly!|- Bye!
{12565}{12685}I finished my new record and...|- That's great, Duncan.
{12687}{12758}Nice to see you. Where is he?|"- ,,,"give me your two cents.
{12801}{12861}Huey said this guy|is practically a monk.
{12863}{12915}What the hell|are you trying to prove?
{12935}{13020}The only reason you're looking|at this guy is because you can't have him.
{13022}{13083}He's a rock 'n' roll|poet sex god.
{13085}{13133}You'll toss him in a week.
{13134}{13220}No, Ing, this one's different.
{13222}{13264}I can feel it.
{13266}{13299}That was good.
{13301}{13357}Kid, I haven't heard|blue-eyed soul like that
{13358}{13413}since Jeff Buckley's record.
{13415}{13455}See what I'm sayin'?
{13457}{13510}What did I tell you, Roma?|He's smokin', right?
{13512}{13568}You did good, Huey.|- I need eight hours, Mom.
{13570}{13630}If I don't get eight hours,|my immune system crashes.
{13632}{13692}Record something more up-tempo|I can get on the radio.
{13694}{13741}Let's go.|- Work it out with Huey.
{13743}{13773}Go...
{13791}{13839}That's what I'm talkin' about.|She gets it.
{13841}{13889}I get it.|You don't get it.
{13890}{13945}Wait...|- Neal, you need to get it.
{13947}{13995}I think we got ourselves|a Grammy!
{14065}{14101}I hate that...
{14102}{14170}Kids! Always hogging|your attention.
{14189}{14247}Hi.|- Hi. Birthday girl.
{14249}{14303}Yeah, happy birthday.|- Thank you.
{14305}{14353}Is this demo thing for real?
{14354}{14426}She's about to sign you!|I can feel it in my bones.
{14428}{14507}Rocket to the moon, baby.|Rocket to the moon.
{14580}{14617}Oh, my.
{14722}{14777}Are you really|Tommy Gunn's daughter?
{14798}{14829}Seriously?
{14874}{14924}Can you hold my purse, please?
{14926}{14963}Yeah.|- Thanks.
{15042}{15070}Jesus!
{15250}{15312}I guess there is|a certain family resemblance.
{15314}{15379}His guitars are in there?|- You wanna come see?
{15381}{15404}Yeah.
{15574}{15643}Can you just wait here|just one second, please?
{15645}{15677}Thank you.|- Yeah.
{16278}{16301}Right.
{16303}{16389}Welcome|to Le Château Chez Molly.
{16542}{16568}Nice.
{16635}{16680}What on God's earth is that?
{16682}{16730}Mu.|- Don't you mean oink?
{16732}{16797}No, "Mu" means "pork" in Thai.
{16799}{16867}He was going to be my curry dinner|one night in Bangkok,
{16869}{16915}but we fell in love.
{16917}{16970}If you wait here,
{16972}{17054}I will fix us some|bonbonnières confiseries.
{17134}{17209}Oh, my God.
{17270}{17326}Looks like you found it|on your own.
{17328}{17360}I can't believe it!
{17401}{17436}This is it.
{17474}{17526}This is the acoustic Muddy Waters|gave Tommy Gunn.
{17528}{17594}He played it at Budokan.|- Summer of '88.
{17596}{17640}Daddy's little girl
{17642}{17669}That's you.
{17670}{17735}Paints the world|with her magic wand
{17737}{17777}Please don't sing that song.
{17778}{17843}"Molly Smiles.|He opened the show with it.
{17845}{17897}For me
{17898}{17962}And then he|and my mom died.
{18066}{18137}Listen, I didn't mean to...
{18139}{18201}Okay. Yeah.
{18275}{18313}So what's next?
{18399}{18444}How about dessert?
{18498}{18541}Am I gonna be able|to pronounce it?
{18543}{18575}I don't know.
{18602}{18681}Can you say...Pez"?
{18714}{18774}I'm just not supposed|to act impulsively, you know?
{18776}{18834}Part of my whole sobriety thing.
{18835}{18901}Made a vow,|haven't broken it yet.
{18930}{18966}Pez.
{19031}{19099}I haven't had a drink|in 224 days.
{19145}{19232}I'm also not supposed to have|romantic relationships my first year.
{19298}{19337}Pez.
{19384}{19449}It's called|the Law of Contrary Behavior.
{19450}{19510}If I want a drink,|I don't have one.
{19512}{19589}If I want to skip a gig,|I force myself to go.
{19590}{19675}If I meet a girl|and I want her to come over...
{19698}{19741}...I send her home.
{19796}{19832}Pez.
{20046}{20098}Those are vows|I haven't broken.
{20391}{20510}Ships crossing like ghosts|in the night
{20511}{20613}Night names,|unremembered faces in sight
{20614}{20733}Took what we can|in need to survive
{20773}{20837}Oh, my God, I love it!
{20838}{20888}It's the most|lyrically advanced thing I've done.
{20890}{20943}No, purple means|rock 'n' roll royalty,
{20945}{21004}and it picks up|the highlights in your eyes.
{21047}{21109}You're too hot for those|earth tones you've been wearing.
{21111}{21197}What about the song?|Is it too fast, too slow, what?
{21198}{21352}It's kind of like the same thing|over and over again.
{21354}{21442}Is there, like, a hook|or a good chorus or something?
{21444}{21480}A hook?|- Yeah.
{21482}{21541}I don't do hooks.|- Okay.
{21557}{21617}I'm not a sell-out. I don't|wear purple and I don't do hooks.
{21619}{21700}I said okay, okay?
{21781}{21910}Names... names unremembered,|faces in sight
{22139}{22187}Molly, I thought you were dead.
{22189}{22270}Neal's in the other room.|- That guy is still there?
{22272}{22341}You always do this.|When are you gonna grow up?
{22342}{22390}He's never going to leave.
{22392}{22471}All he does is mope|and play these loser songs.
{22501}{22533}Help me, please.
{22534}{22602}I don't know how to get rid of this guy|without breaking his heart.
{22634}{22710}Hold.|Just a minute!
{22712}{22781}Oh, my God,|I'm being totally suffocated.
{22843}{22867}Yeah?
{22869}{22941}Can you take those off?
{22966}{23017}Ing, I'll call you.
{23072}{23167}Baby...I'm not a love machine.
{23169}{23229}No, my boxers...|can I have them back, please?
{23367}{23391}Thanks.
{23414}{23447}What's going on?
{23449}{23529}Listen, I've got to go.|- Go?
{23562}{23614}Go where, go?
{23616}{23656}Home, Molly.
{23658}{23728}The place where I live,|where I have a life,
{23730}{23811}where I do my laundry,|get sleep, try to make music.
{23813}{23858}Why can't you|make music here?
{23860}{23908}This is a world gone mad,
{23910}{23960}like I've stepped|through the looking-glass.
{23962}{24027}There's a week's worth of leftovers,|a month of laundry.
{24029}{24087}Look at this place.|- We'll call maid service.
{24089}{24190}"You" call maid service.|I've got to rejoin the human race.
{24192}{24221}No!
{24289}{24317}I don't understand.
{24318}{24418}Listen, I just feel|like I'm suffocating.
{24420}{24492}I need some air.|- We can open the windows.
{24494}{24581}It's not about the windows.|I need my shirt back.
{24639}{24693}Damn! I forgot|to get new strings.
{24694}{24753}I have, like,|five gigs this week
{24754}{24824}and I have not done|a single thing.
{24826}{24926}I have got to get to work.|I'll call you later, I swear.
{25208}{25259}Oh, my God.
{25261}{25320}This place is beyond|its normal grotesque.
{25322}{25361}It's post-nuclear.
{25418}{25481}Ninety-eight messages?
{25483}{25561}Molly, your machine|has 98 messages on it.
{25563}{25617}Write them down for me,|will you?
{25650}{25737}He's gone.|I have no life.
{25819}{25849}What?
{25850}{25908}"Of course you have a life.
{25926}{25973}"I don't need to tell you that.
{25975}{26023}That's what you're|supposed to say to me.
{26025}{26049}Sorry.
{26051}{26136}As your best friend,|it's my duty not to lie to you.
{26138}{26203}Besides,|you wanted him gone, remember?
{26205}{26249}I did?
{26277}{26321}What are all these|final notices?
{26322}{26366}I'm gonna call him.
{26368}{26421}I think now is|a good time to call him.
{26446}{26503}Would you hand me the phone?|I'm gonna call him right now.
{26545}{26610}Focus for one second.
{26612}{26708}Your electric has been canceled|and so has your gas.
{26710}{26759}Who pays your bills?
{26783}{26813}Bob.
{26842}{26877}Bob who?
{26878}{26941}I don't know.|My parents' guy Bob.
{27080}{27123}Your phone's dead.
{27125}{27169}These rooms...
{27208}{27305}...sound so empty|without the sound of his music.
{27351}{27416}Bob's number|has been disconnected.
{27440}{27467}Oh, God.
{27469}{27537}I'm sure it's little consolation,|but you're not the only one
{27538}{27584}who got taken, Miss Gunn.
{27586}{27650}Bob Kopalski had ten clients,
{27652}{27739}assets equaling over $100 million,|when he disappeared.
{27741}{27794}You're telling us|that none of it's insured?
{27796}{27885}What a disaster.|Thank God for the residuals.
{27886}{28006}Actually, Kopalski took such heavy|advances on the royalty income
{28008}{28079}that by the time|the account recoups,
{28081}{28135}Miss Gunn will be|on Social Security.
{28137}{28206}Where does someone disappear|with $100 million?
{28208}{28281}The best we can guess|is South America.
{28283}{28319}Can't you just sue?
{28321}{28412}My God,|how could he do this to her?
{28414}{28498}He'll be back.|They always come back.
{28500}{28584}If he does, he'll be looking|out the back of an FBI van
{28586}{28639}on his way|to a long prison term.
{28641}{28737}It'll be years|before you see a dime, if ever.
{28784}{28893}Mr. Feldman, as a lawyer,
{28894}{28949}may I please ask your advice
{28950}{29082}as per what to do in the meantime|as far as, you know, money?
{29114}{29151}Get a job?
{29214}{29248}"Dear prospective employer,
{29256}{29314}"although I've had|no previous employment, ever,
{29316}{29369}"the following is a partial|but significant list
{29371}{29466}of personal recommendations,|including contact information.
{29486}{29552}The Dalai Lama, Tibet?
{29554}{29633}900-thread count|Egyptian cotton.
{29652}{29739}No man can resist|Egyptian cotton.
{29741}{29810}Tibet is a country, Molly,|not contact information.
{29812}{29848}Why not add "earth"
{29850}{29902}in case someone|needs to know where Tibet is?
{29904}{29945}This is not a résumé.
{29947}{30001}It shows I'm a people person.
{30050}{30086}Focus on the interview.
{30088}{30136}Hello.|Pleasure to meet you.
{30138}{30212}I will work overtime, weekends,|holidays, Yom Kippur, Christmas.
{30214}{30288}You name it, I will be here.|- I'm sure that won't be necessary.
{30290}{30346}Ingrid says you guys met|at Darlington?
{30348}{30416}I was valedictorian there|two years in a row.
{30418}{30473}That's so neat.
{30481}{30556}Tell me, what is the price|on a set of these?
{30558}{30631}$1,369 plus tax.
{30633}{30712}You're in denial.|You're broke, remember?
{30714}{30811}Trish, hon, tell me, do employees|get a discount around here?
{30813}{30909}Ten percent, and some employees|are among our best customers.
{30978}{31086}I'll take them.|Ing, this is the greatest job ever.
{31267}{31345}Who is it?|- It's Molly!
{31346}{31420}I was just out shopping|in the neighbonood.
{31422}{31503}At midnight?|- It's the city that never sleeps.
{31594}{31669}You can't do this.|I have to be at the studio at 9:00.
{31671}{31737}I can't act like a kid anymore.|- Really?
{31738}{31826}Neal, I haven't seen sheets|like this since the third grade.
{31863}{31895}Rocket ships?
{31897}{31978}You wouldn't have my jacket in there?|It's like my lucky jacket.
{31980}{32062}I never get onstage without it.|I left it behind the other day.
{32064}{32103}No.
{32105}{32195}I guess you're gonna have to|come over and look for it.
{32197}{32255}I can't disappear|from the world again.
{32257}{32351}I can't lose myself in this obsessive-|compulsive irrational behavior.
{32480}{32512}Feel.
{32528}{32574}Excuse me?|- Feel.
{32628}{32676}Egyptian cotton...
{32713}{32772}...900-thread count.
{32818}{32865}All right, I'll tell you what.
{32867}{32947}Maybe we can, like,|date, okay?
{32949}{32972}Okay.
{32974}{33089}But it's gonna have to be|a mature adult relationship with...
{33090}{33155}alarm clocks in the morning...|- I love alarm clocks.
{33157}{33209}...and work during the day.
{33210}{33287}We eat with silverware,|knives and forks...
{33305}{33350}...drink out of glasses...
{33366}{33404}...do the dishes.
{33433}{33480}Is it bedtime yet?
{33600}{33649}Molly, wake up.
{33795}{33832}I'm sorry.
{33847}{33897}It's not going to work out.
{33917}{33992}You spent all night at that guy's|house doing God knows what,
{33994}{34042}then you come here|and crash at work.
{34044}{34134}I can't believe you did this to me|after all the strings I pulled.
{34136}{34200}I know that I'm|an undeserving creep,
{34202}{34257}but can we please|talk about it over lunch?
{34259}{34336}No! Our lunch date is canceled.|You can't afford lunch.
{34338}{34438}Fine, see if I care.|I'll live off of water and sunshine.
{34440}{34480}You won't have to.
{34482}{34555}Once again your main man|is gonna come through for ya.
{34592}{34663}You're gonna get me|a record deal.
{34665}{34702}Not exactly.
{34953}{35048}Hi!|- Oh, my God.
{35050}{35093}You're my new nanny?
{35094}{35145}Hi, Laraine.|- It's Ray.
{35170}{35210}Nobody calls me Laraine.
{35212}{35273}Okay, Ray, I'm Molly.
{35275}{35323}We met at my birthday party,|remember?
{35325}{35353}You're late.
{35354}{35391}By, like, a second.
{35408}{35480}By three and a half minutes.
{35482}{35612}I have to take my Aciphex|by 4:26, and it's...4:18 right now.
{35614}{35700}We'll take it when we get home.|- That's when I take my Colitin.
{35751}{35807}The agency must really be|getting desperate.
{35823}{35888}I actually am uniquely qualified|for this position,
{35890}{35933}having spent so many years
{35935}{35994}developing my skills|as a people person.
{36209}{36257}Mission accomplished?
{36259}{36302}Fruit punch?
{36304}{36362}Why don't you|just drink cyanide?
{36364}{36401}At least it's quick.
{36511}{36538}Damn.
{36556}{36608}Hang your coat up in there.
{37884}{37936}What is this, "The Shining"?
{38431}{38481}Who is that?|- Nobody.
{38520}{38589}What's wrong with him?|- None of your b-i business.
{38590}{38624}Shoes!
{38906}{38955}This is your room?
{38957}{39016}There's no fooling you,|is there?
{39062}{39093}It's so...
{39214}{39253}...orderly.
{39338}{39374}These are so neat!
{39376}{39426}I remember when there were|only four models.
{39428}{39498}I can't believe this.|She's beautiful.
{39500}{39559}Look at these legs.|- That's Pliéing Polly.
{39561}{39609}Put her back!
{39698}{39747}How cool is this?
{39749}{39797}Look at this little tea set!
{39870}{39964}You don't touch that unless|I happen to invite you to tea.
{39966}{40014}Look at these cute little scones.
{40016}{40064}Get away from there.
{40066}{40166}Well, I say, Lady Sassafras,|would you like some "crème fraîche"
{40168}{40229}to go with|your darling pastries?
{40297}{40419}You just got your germy drool|over my plastic scone, you freako.
{40578}{40633}Kid, have you ever been|to a shrink?
{40634}{40667}Since I was three.
{40720}{40744}What?
{40746}{40828}Good afternoon, Miss Ray.|Dinner is ready.
{40870}{40942}There's just nothing|like good help.
{41164}{41203}You missed a spot.
{41242}{41317}Isn't doing the dishes what the maid|is supposed to be for?
{41318}{41374}She doesn't know how to dry|without leaving spots.
{41376}{41440}You don't know how to dry|without destroying the environment.
{41442}{41493}For every roll|of paper towels you waste,
{41495}{41543}a tree in the rain forest dies.
{41545}{41580}I'm gonna die of botulism
{41582}{41646}from the germs on that gunky|towel, you tree-Ioving hippie.
{41648}{41751}At least I don't prefer tofu|to normal hamburgers.
{41753}{41830}I'm not the one who's gonna get|mad cow disease and go nuts,
{41832}{41901}though you don't seem to have|a brain to fry in the first place.
{41902}{41999}Maybe not, but at least I'm not|holding the germ-infested towel.
{42078}{42105}Give me that plate.
{42106}{42154}No, sorry.|You might infect it.
{42180}{42259}Why don't you get your plastic|baggie and dig up some penicillin?
{42261}{42296}No!|- Come on.
{42298}{42351}Give me the plate!|- You want it?
{42353}{42381}How bad do you want it?
{42481}{42521}Get a broom.
{42522}{42585}You get a frickin' broom.
{42618}{42696}When you work for me,|you leave when I say you can leave.
{42698}{42761}For your information,|I do not work for you.
{42762}{42806}I am employed by your mother.
{42808}{42870}Yeah?|Take a look around.
{42872}{42920}Do you see her anywhere?
{42922}{43004}News flash... you're not gonna
{43006}{43062}unless you make an appointment|with her assistant
{43064}{43136}or hang around her bedroom door|at 3:00 in the morning.
{43138}{43258}In the meantime,|you're workin' for me.
{43260}{43313}Is that so?
{43346}{43443}News flash, Mussolini...
{43478}{43513}I quit!
{43526}{43561}Swinging door.
{43647}{43723}Are you all right, Miss Gunn?|- Just great.
{43924}{43961}Baby!
{43978}{44061}Baby, what are you doing outside|all by yourself?
{44124}{44191}How did you get locked out?
{44252}{44300}Mama's had a day.
{44484}{44584}I've lived here for 20 years.|How can you do this?
{44586}{44632}Aside from that...
{44670}{44722}This is a family building,|Miss Gunn.
{44724}{44794}I suggest you find somewhere|you'd be more welcome.
{44796}{44842}Like Los Angeles.
{44844}{44892}You will be allowed back|into your apartment
{44894}{44973}only so long as you are accompanied|by a management representative
{44974}{45035}and only long enough|to gather your belongings.
{45037}{45117}That is, those personal belongings|we don't insist on holding
{45118}{45217}as collateral for the rent|and utilities you owe.
{45218}{45302}You are otherwise barred|from the premises.
{45995}{46045}I know this is|a big change for you,
{46046}{46109}but it'll feel like home|in no time at all.
{46111}{46202}This is the bedroom...|my bedroom, of course...
{46204}{46274}but there's plenty|of drawer space if you need it.
{46276}{46344}I can't believe those creeps|would throw a destitute woman
{46346}{46381}into the street.
{46383}{46431}Chivalry is so dead.
{46433}{46509}This is the bathroom.|I hung up your towels for you.
{46510}{46561}I've been here|a thousand times.
{46563}{46599}You know the kitchen.
{46601}{46684}Julie and Holly come over|Thursdays for our weekly bake fest.
{46686}{46765}Mondays, Penny and Ethel come|so we can do yoga with Rajiiv
{46766}{46811}right here in the living room.
{46813}{46909}But this is going to be|a problem.
{46925}{47023}Ing, don't you think it's weird|that Neal hasn't called me?
{47025}{47089}No, but I think it's weird|that you're wearing his jacket.
{47090}{47151}I told you just bring|the essentials, Molly.
{47153}{47210}You can't keep all this stuff.
{47212}{47285}And he definitely has to go.
{47420}{47468}Mu, what are we gonna do?
{47470}{47520}Downsize, Molly.|Purify.
{47522}{47573}Streamline,|find your center.
{47574}{47610}You're right, Ing.
{47611}{47683}We're gonna get you the best|housewarming present ever.
{47685}{47713}Don't be silly.
{47714}{47795}It's gonna be hard enough on you|coming up with half the rent.
{48218}{48269}Wonderful, girls.
{48271}{48333}Tomorrow we start rehearsing|for next month's recital,
{48335}{48384}but I think we still have|five minutes.
{48386}{48451}How about a little freestyle?
{48623}{48696}You sure looked great|out there.
{48770}{48843}I just, you know...
{48845}{48909}Yelling at you|the other day and all...
{48957}{48995}I'm sorry.
{49031}{49077}What are you doing here?
{49078}{49150}I called Roma, your mom...
{49175}{49281}...and she said that if you said|that it was okay,
{49282}{49330}I could have my job back?
{49493}{49538}You're on probation.
{49679}{49733}Act your age,|not your shoe size.
{49734}{49792}How come you left|dance class so early?
{49794}{49860}That freestyle at the end|looked like so much fun.
{49862}{49947}Freestyle is for moronic little kids|and hippie freaks.
{49949}{49992}It's fun.
{49994}{50059}Fundamentals|are the building blocks of fun.
{50061}{50088}Says who?
{50090}{50196}Mikhail Baryshnikov,|who I'm sure you've never heard of.
{50198}{50277}Ballet is about precision,|discipline, and poise.
{50279}{50327}They made us take ballet|at Darlington.
{50329}{50407}I couldn't wait to get out there|and make up all my own moves.
{50409}{50450}Figures.|Such a sloppy doofus.
{50452}{50512}Figures. You're such|a pill-popping little tyrant.
{50536}{50576}Don't ever do that|to me again.
{50578}{50628}You're hurting me.|- You hurt me.
{50630}{50658}Take it back.
{50700}{50735}Take it back.
{50748}{50786}Fine.
{50826}{50881}I take it back.
{50912}{50958}It's a good thing you did.
{50960}{51025}Otherwise you wouldn't|have gotten your surprise.
{51058}{51090}Surprise.
{51092}{51155}I really hate surprises,|and I sincerely doubt
{51157}{51236}there's anything you could give me|that I don't already have.
{51238}{51289}There's no harm|in trying, is there?
{51491}{51531}Ray, are you all right?
{51613}{51696}My glands are swollen.|I'm having an allergic reaction.
{51698}{51746}My immune system|is crashing.
{51748}{51814}Mu stayed with you|one measly little night.
{51816}{51846}Come on.
{51891}{51933}And that's all|he's gonna be staying.
{51935}{52009}Wasn't it fun, though,|sneaking him in and out for his walk?
{52011}{52089}It was like a real, live adventure.|You know you had fun.
{52090}{52133}I'm not a swineherd, kook.
{52134}{52179}Excuse me.|How much is this putter?
{52181}{52253}This putter is not for sale.|Sorry. This is a mistake.
{52255}{52317}You don't golf.|- Tiger gave this to me.
{52318}{52377}Essentials, remember?|You've got to get rid of this junk.
{52378}{52407}It's essential.
{52456}{52495}Twenty dollars.|- Ten.
{52497}{52524}Sold.
{52526}{52589}Can I talk to you for a second?|Come through here.
{52591}{52674}Do me a favor, all right?|Watch your step.
{52694}{52745}This is Kelli.|Kelli, this is Molly.
{52746}{52775}Pleasure to meet you.
{52777}{52841}Looks almost as good on her|as it does on you, doesn't it?
{52842}{52945}Gooey! Looks like Mu isn't|the only pig you hang out with.
{52946}{52986}Go away!
{52988}{53054}It must be really hard|getting rid of all this neat stuff.
{53056}{53114}No, I'm actually loving it.
{53116}{53164}Really?|- It's very refreshing.
{53166}{53221}Everybody, once in their life,|should do this
{53223}{53335}and slough off all the bad...|Wait!
{53337}{53413}Sorry. This is...mine.
{53415}{53496}No, I just bought it.|- How much did you pay?
{53498}{53549}Thirty dollars.|- My friend Rosella gave it to me.
{53551}{53610}I'll give you 50. 75!
{53629}{53661}Enough!
{53662}{53710}We're downsizing, remember?
{53712}{53798}Sloughing off the excess|to find our center.
{53800}{53841}You want this, Molly.
{53842}{53907}Close your eyes|and repeat after me.
{53915}{53958}I want this.
{54230}{54262}Miss Gunn?
{54318}{54378}We're ready to pack this room up|for storage, ma'am.
{54423}{54493}Can I have just|five more minutes, please?
{54494}{54535}Okay, sure.|- Thank you.
{54870}{54905}Is that you?
{55088}{55129}Dad's a rock star?
{55148}{55178}Was.
{55202}{55237}He's dead.
{55254}{55334}Bet this stuff|is worth a bundle.
{55336}{55398}I can't just sell it, Ray.
{55400}{55472}It's my parents' stuff.
{55498}{55601}No, you're gonna box it up so it|can lay in storage gathering dust.
{55637}{55689}God, you're pathetic.
{55789}{55859}That man in the library|in your house...
{55900}{55984}...nurse said he's in a coma|from a massive stroke.
{56008}{56060}That's your father, huh?
{56082}{56121}Was.
{56122}{56172}He's a vegetable now.
{56174}{56227}Soon he'll be nothing.
{56251}{56300}That's kind of harsh.
{56355}{56406}It's a harsh world.
{56530}{56578}Watch where you're going!
{56942}{57001}Neal, I really hate talking|to your machine.
{57003}{57039}Where are you?
{57041}{57097}I'm still holding on|to your jacket for you.
{57099}{57157}I know you've been going crazy|trying to reach me,
{57158}{57241}but I've been|in a transition right now.
{57243}{57305}I'm, like, Miss Proletariat now.
{57306}{57409}Mop the floors, spank the brat,|pick up the paycheck on Friday.
{57411}{57476}I am a woman.|How about you?
{57478}{57516}Shit!
{57680}{57728}Get under the tail.
{57730}{57780}I'm not putting my hand|under his heinie.
{57782}{57822}Do you want him|to stay here or not?
{57824}{57893}Oh, God!|Oh, my God!
{57895}{57945}I'll get him!
{58032}{58075}Very good.|Now come out of plough.
{58077}{58129}Very nice.|Breathing. Good.
{58130}{58211}Pull up under. Very nice.|Molly, out of plough.
{58213}{58260}Come on, Molly.|Let's go.
{58262}{58356}Could you please help me?|This is starting to hurt.
{58358}{58396}Oh, my God.
{58398}{58436}73...beautiful.
{58438}{58467}74,
{58469}{58501}75...very good.
{58503}{58534}76,
{58536}{58563}77...
{58565}{58607}Let me put a few more on.
{58609}{58651}Ing, here we go.
{58678}{58708}Waist.
{58731}{58809}Molly, you get to be in charge|of the chocolate chip cookies.
{58811}{58863}They're already mixed,|so all you have to do
{58865}{58915}is put them in the oven|and time them.
{58978}{59007}Salmonella.
{59142}{59189}You're letting her do this?
{59191}{59238}Relax, girls.|It's just cookie mix.
{59240}{59291}How badly|can she screw it up?
{59293}{59331}Put it out now!|Put it out!
{59333}{59385}I'm trying!
{59578}{59645}Oh, gosh!|This is Neal's jacket!
{59674}{59721}Put it out!|- Get it out!
{59722}{59794}Take it back!
{59796}{59850}Oh, my God!|- Take it back now!
{59852}{59907}What are you doing, Ray?
{59969}{60020}Have you gone mad?
{60022}{60108}There is never, ever an excuse|for hitting another person.
{60110}{60135}What's going on?
{60137}{60207}She was laughing at me|because her "au pair"
{60209}{60289}said that my new nanny|was a slutbag whore.
{60397}{60432}Go!
{60948}{61013}I'm sorry.|Sorry.
{61203}{61235}You've reached Ingrid.
{61237}{61292}Please leave your number|and the time of your call.
{61294}{61336}Be specific.
{61338}{61399}Hi, it's Neal calling for Molly.
{61401}{61448}I hope this is|the right number.
{61576}{61624}I love Ingrid|with all my heart
{61626}{61693}and all her cute|Martha Stewart-wannabe friends,
{61695}{61754}but it's a real estrogen-fest|over there.
{61756}{61855}A girl needs a testosterone injection|every once in a while.
{61856}{61905}Not that I think|of you that way.
{61907}{61955}You're super-sensitive.
{61956}{61992}Don't be a silly goose.
{61994}{62047}Please let me|patronize the arts.
{62048}{62095}Well, actually...
{62132}{62179}I just signed a deal|with Schleine Records.
{62208}{62264}Oh, my God.|What?
{62266}{62370}Oh, my God!|Neal, that's incredible!
{62372}{62451}That's amazing!|Why didn't you say anything?
{62464}{62519}I would have, but this is|the first time tonight
{62520}{62562}I've managed|to get a word in edgewise.
{62564}{62589}I...
{62700}{62753}So how did you seal the deal?
{62755}{62863}Ships crossing like ghosts|in the night
{62864}{62952}Names unremembered,|faces in sight
{62954}{63050}Take what we can|in need to survive
{63052}{63138}I know this one.|This is the deep one.
{63140}{63235}Words exchanging kisses|i i
{63237}{63375}Leave me scarred,|feeling confused
{63396}{63474}I'll see what unfolds
{63476}{63521}Don't hide what I need
{63523}{63616}Girl, now, I love you so
{63690}{63748}Sheets of Egyptian cotton
{63785}{63843}Sheets of Egyptian cotton
{63878}{63932}Sheets of Egyptian cotton
{63968}{64024}Sheets of Egyptian cot...
{64025}{64074}I guess I looked|deep down inside
{64076}{64141}and...found that inner hook.
{64143}{64191}You certainly did...
{64207}{64269}...and that calls for...
{64295}{64373}...an outer hook to go with it.
{64468}{64542}What's that?|- Your lucky jacket.
{64578}{64608}My lucky...
{64662}{64732}What have you done to it?|- A few minor improvements.
{64734}{64767}Improvements?|- Yeah.
{64768}{64824}You mutilated it!|- No, I fixed it.
{64825}{64913}Look how great this is. I told you|purple was your magic color.
{64915}{64953}We have to talk.
{64955}{65020}Those are the four|most hateful words in English.
{65022}{65068}I can't see you anymore.
{65070}{65135}I'm sorry about the jacket.|- It's not about the jacket.
{65136}{65193}I just can't see you.
{65211}{65239}That's all.
{65241}{65329}Right. You just do|the rock star's daughter
{65331}{65388}so you can tell|your pop star-wannabe mates,
{65390}{65454}then ride off into the sunset|with your crummy guitar...
{65456}{65531}It's not like that.|I'm just not in a place...
{65656}{65735}Ray, can you|turn that down, please?
{65952}{66000}Thank you.
{66125}{66196}You're supposed to put|the cream in before the sugar.
{66198}{66285}I'm not having cream.|I can't gain weight.
{66287}{66342}My ballet recital|is Friday night, remember?
{66344}{66419}Right. I remember.
{66443}{66543}I invited you to afternoon tea.|The least you can do is be polite.
{66544}{66607}Why are you buttering|my plastic scone?
{66623}{66711}Why are plastic scones on the table|when we have real food?
{66753}{66797}You thought they were cute.
{66856}{66919}Are you still moping|over that disgusting guy?
{66993}{67048}Other people|always let you down.
{67049}{67112}Why don't you forget them|and do something for yourself?
{67114}{67156}Like what?
{67157}{67212}I don't know.|Something you're good at.
{67213}{67259}And I don't mean shopping.
{67284}{67347}Maybe some of us|aren't good at anything.
{67349}{67406}Every grownup|is good at something.
{67436}{67466}My bad.
{67468}{67526}I don't see any grownups|around here.
{67543}{67605}What's so great|about being a grownup anyway?
{67643}{67686}So I can turn out like you?
{67688}{67727}You're scared.
{67764}{67841}Sometimes when Mu hears people|walking by outside the door,
{67843}{67918}he gets this funny expression|and runs into the bathroom,
{67920}{67973}like he thinks|they're coming to get him.
{67992}{68041}That's how you look.
{68059}{68091}Where are you going?
{68092}{68149}If you refuse|to have a nice time with me,
{68151}{68216}I'm going to have fun|by myself.
{68218}{68317}Two hundred pliés isn't fun, Ray.|It's slave labor.
{68319}{68401}Fundamentals are|the building blocks of fun.
{68403}{68469}Right. I forgot.
{68471}{68520}What is with|this music, anyway?
{68522}{68583}It's like a soundtrack|to slit your wrists to.
{68585}{68672}It happens to be Mozart.|- It happens to be depressing.
{68674}{68787}If we're gonna have fun, we need|to listen to music that's fun.
{69011}{69061}I hate to break it to you,
{69063}{69176}but this junk is not music!
{69177}{69247}But it sure is fun|to dance to!
{69528}{69566}Cut it out!
{69568}{69615}You look like a spastic hyena!
{69617}{69708}What are you doing?|What is your problem?
{69709}{69765}Let me go!
{69767}{69812}What are you doing?
{70222}{70261}Grow up.
{70388}{70426}Where are you going now?
{70428}{70496}I have about a million|last-minute errands to run
{70497}{70571}and a date with this|normal adult guy I met.
{70572}{70630}He's in computers.
{70632}{70703}Ing, I am so sick|of all of these rock 'n' rollers,
{70705}{70788}overpaid jocks,|and supermodel bitch boys.
{70847}{70920}You know, I thought maybe,
{70922}{70979}just maybe, you'd remember|we had plans tonight.
{71000}{71095}Green tea tasting|at the Asia Society, remember?
{71150}{71244}If I never have a drop of tea again,|it would be too soon.
{71245}{71331}Please, go without me.|You'll have fun, Ing.
{71332}{71375}I'm already a half-hour late.
{71376}{71424}We were supposed|to go together.
{71426}{71482}I RSVP'd over a month ago.
{71484}{71534}It's too late|to invite anyone else.
{71536}{71631}We're roomies, Ing.|That's why I pay half the rent.
{71648}{71731}It doesn't mean I owe you|every minute of my free time.
{71733}{71761}Owe me?
{71765}{71899}You mean, for free yoga or nearly|burning down my apartment?
{71901}{71972}Owe me? Is that what you|think of our friendship?
{71974}{72075}Only because you think friendship|is having total control over my life.
{72076}{72154}Unfortunately, you don't know|how to run your life, Molly.
{72156}{72219}Fortunately,|that's not your problem.
{72236}{72269}Not anymore.
{72399}{72433}Look at you.
{72456}{72546}You got rollers in your hair.|Is that your new style?
{72548}{72594}I forgot.|I was in a hurry.
{72596}{72631}Just playing.|Come here.
{72673}{72712}Huey, my suitcases.
{72714}{72746}My bad.
{72748}{72812}Your room is that way.|Put your bags in there.
{72814}{72851}I got your bed made up.
{72853}{72904}Sorry. I'm sorry.|- It's okay.
{72906}{72972}Okay. Thank you|for taking me in like this.
{72974}{73061}Don't even trip. We all know|Ingrid can be a little anal.
{73063}{73103}It's all good.|Besides...
{73105}{73155}life with Huey|is one big party.
{73157}{73254}Party time!
{73374}{73430}That's what I'm talkin' about.
{73474}{73514}Your turn.
{73877}{73929}Bravo!
{73931}{73979}Beautiful.
{74015}{74039}Lovely.
{74231}{74255}Yeah!
{74613}{74651}Molly, no!
{74678}{74712}Hi, Roma.
{74756}{74801}It's me... Molly.
{74803}{74860}Ray's nanny?
{74876}{74919}Yes, of course.
{74920}{74977}I was at your birthday party.|- Yeah.
{74979}{75027}I'm a fan of your father's.
{75028}{75082}He had that one song...|What was it?
{75084}{75147}With your name in it.|- Yes.
{75148}{75220}I was just wondering,|'cause it's my night off...
{75222}{75257}who's watching Ray?
{75259}{75321}She's at some|ballet thing or other.
{75323}{75367}Oh, God.
{75368}{75451}It's her recital?|I have to get over there.
{75452}{75500}I'm sure it's over by now.
{75502}{75559}I've arranged|to have a car pick her up, okay?
{75560}{75596}Excuse me for a moment.
{75598}{75631}I'm sorry.|Go ahead.
{76565}{76627}Rise and shine, Ophelia.
{76629}{76720}Hello, my little sugar pie.|How you doin'?
{76721}{76774}Isn't it your day off?
{76789}{76834}Indeed it is.
{76864}{76900}And it's yours, too.
{76902}{77016}No school, no homework,|and especially no fatal illnesses.
{77017}{77045}Let me see this.
{77088}{77138}Look at this.
{77140}{77201}Perfect 98.6,
{77203}{77267}only 20 degrees|above the temperature
{77269}{77323}of the beautiful day|awaiting us.
{77324}{77414}I'm not going anywhere,|especially with you.
{77416}{77462}Oh, yes, you are.
{77533}{77595}We are going to sit|in giant teacups
{77597}{77686}and spin round and round|in circles until we puke.
{77688}{77744}Are you on crack?
{77765}{77801}We're gonna have fun.
{77928}{77989}I can't believe|I let you talk me into this.
{77991}{78055}You are gonna so love|Coney Island, Ray.
{78057}{78131}Giant teacups you sit in.
{78132}{78241}It's a ride, Ray,|like the ones at Disneyland.
{78297}{78351}Haven't you ever been|to Disneyland?
{78398}{78482}You've never been to Disneyland?|- Why don't you alert the media?
{78484}{78589}Haven't you ever been|to an amusement park... ever?
{78616}{78652}Oh, my God!
{78676}{78745}Ray, you are so psyched!|- Whatever!
{78770}{78848}Say it, Ray.|Say, "I am so psyched.
{78850}{78898}I'm psyched, okay?
{78920}{78975}Then you're gonna|have to pay the toll.
{78976}{79024}It's like passing|through the gates
{79026}{79078}before you can get|into the Emerald City.
{79080}{79130}Let me go.|Are you trying to murder me?
{79132}{79193}You have to eat one,|or they're not gonna let you in.
{79195}{79243}They're toxic, you maniac.
{79244}{79292}They have dead rats|and nitrates.
{79294}{79390}Do you want to ride|the Spinning Teacups or not?
{79693}{79729}N ow swa ow
{79744}{79784}Swallow.
{79951}{79984}Wait.
{80131}{80180}She's alive.
{80182}{80214}She's alive!
{80216}{80284}The operation was a success,|ladies and gentlemen!
{80285}{80323}She's alive!
{80787}{80820}Excuse me.
{80821}{80876}Why is it so dead around here?
{80877}{80959}The rides don't run|till the season starts.
{80960}{81005}The season?
{81019}{81070}You're a week early.
{81103}{81137}Thanks.
{82419}{82459}Let's go home.
{82872}{82986}The last time I saw my mom|and dad, I was eight going on nine...
{82988}{83066}eight years, six months,|and three days,
{83068}{83131}almost as old as you are.
{83132}{83230}They were going on tour,|leaving me behind for the first time.
{83232}{83292}They didn't want me|missing any more school.
{83294}{83348}When they came to my room|to say good-bye,
{83350}{83442}I wouldn't open the door,|so they left.
{83444}{83486}I fell asleep.
{83506}{83555}The next thing I knew...
{83577}{83639}...my nanny was waking me up|in the middle of the night
{83641}{83702}telling me|their plane had crashed.
{83704}{83761}You're lucky.|- Lucky?
{83763}{83808}That you were mad.
{83828}{83893}When you're mad,|you don't miss people,
{83895}{83979}and if you stay mad,|it's like you never knew them at all.
{83981}{84043}That way you don't|have to feel sucky about it.
{84057}{84095}You were lucky.
{84168}{84195}Night.
{84251}{84300}I wasn't mad, Ray.
{84339}{84391}I was confused.
{84407}{84460}Everyone was talking to me,
{84462}{84528}and I couldn't understand|a word they were saying.
{84572}{84635}Then their voices|became a blur...
{84660}{84731}...and soon I couldn't even|recognize their faces.
{84756}{84807}They were like these blobs.
{84836}{84896}Then they started|to grow fangs...
{84920}{84972}...and their eyes|became green.
{85000}{85052}I knew I had to run away.
{85101}{85149}I packed my knapsack,
{85151}{85239}got on the train,|looked up at the map,
{85240}{85323}and decided that I wanted|to live in Coney Island.
{85344}{85439}I thought|it was gonna be a real island...
{85467}{85572}...and I could hide away there like|Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.
{85574}{85631}Imagine my surprise.
{85632}{85716}The Teacups was the only ride|they'd let me on by myself.
{85718}{85845}I got on it and started|spinning myself round and round.
{85864}{85920}I feel like I'm still there,
{85922}{85993}spinning round|and round and round,
{85995}{86055}and the ride won't stop,
{86057}{86116}and I won't dare get off.
{86172}{86220}You were right, Ray.
{86416}{86463}I am scared.
{86540}{86582}But you're scared, too.
{86611}{86665}You're as scared as I am,
{86667}{86726}and I thought maybe...
{86750}{86799}I thought maybe if we...
{86820}{86872}...could go together...
{88320}{88372}Morning, cutie.
{88391}{88428}You hungry?
{88905}{88953}You're up a little early.
{89170}{89218}What are you doing here?
{89248}{89310}I happen to work here.
{89312}{89347}What are you doing?
{89349}{89400}Don't forget the sugar, sugar!
{90824}{90866}Just breathe.
{91094}{91135}Lady!
{91155}{91234}Lady, that water|is contaminated, you know.
{91236}{91288}You better get out of there.
{91290}{91344}That's pure sewage|you're in, there.
{91364}{91426}Did you hear me?|Did you hear me?
{91428}{91494}Yeah, I heard you!|- That water's filthy!
{91496}{91546}If you don't get out,|I'll call the police.
{91548}{91591}I'm getting out.
{91956}{92007}A hundred and one degrees.
{92024}{92060}Sick as a dog.
{92062}{92118}You better hope|you don't get radiation poisoning
{92120}{92176}from that toxic pond scum.
{92178}{92236}Take two Echinacea
{92237}{92310}and a Benadryl|for your sinuses.
{92312}{92368}Okay.|- Call me if you need anything else.
{92369}{92414}Stay here, Mu.
{92492}{92534}Where are you going?
{92536}{92574}I don't know.
{92576}{92621}Maybe the library.
{92664}{92711}Is that where you went|last night?
{92743}{92779}I'm not gonna bother him.
{92780}{92853}I'm just gonna sit quietly|and read or something.
{92871}{92926}You can read out loud.
{92928}{92970}I think he might like that.
{92972}{93026}He's a vegetable, Molly.
{93028}{93127}Chatting it up with my dad isn't|gonna do anyone any good at all.
{93128}{93166}You're the doctor.
{93168}{93224}It's not gonna do any good.
{93226}{93296}I saw this show once on TV
{93297}{93353}about all these sick people.
{93355}{93460}The ones where their friends|and families talked to them
{93462}{93565}held on ten times longer|than the ones left all alone,
{93567}{93649}and that is a fact.
{93733}{93779}Do you swear?
{93807}{93843}I swear.
{93874}{93913}Pinky promise?
{93944}{93977}Don't touch.
{94004}{94087}Germs. Sorry.|- Germs. Right.
{94188}{94228}Wanna come?
{94413}{94457}Can I help you|with something?
{94459}{94543}She's going to go talk to him|for a little while.
{94545}{94600}You know...privately?
{94672}{94728}I can't think of what to say.
{94729}{94790}There's an all-time first.
{95137}{95174}Hey, Dad.
{95200}{95250}I know I haven't...
{95279}{95391}Well, what I really wanted|to tell you was about my new pet.
{95392}{95443}It's really Molly's,|my nanny,
{95445}{95524}but the thing is,
{95526}{95616}it's a pig...literally.
{95618}{95680}His name is Mu.
{95682}{95732}He's from Thailand.
{95734}{95797}He's really clean,|I have to admit,
{95799}{95849}even if he is a pig.
{95947}{96043}Anyway, what I'm really into|these days is ballet.
{96045}{96132}You and Mom used to say|that it was old-fashioned,
{96134}{96187}but I swear it's really cool.
{96188}{96261}I'm already doing|"changements" and "chaînèes..."
{96263}{96334}you know, when you spin|and spin and spin.
{96336}{96380}It used to make me dizzy.
{96381}{96440}Now I'm only dizzy when I stop.
{96795}{96885}What a one-hit wonder|that slut turned out to be.
{96887}{96940}It's his first single.|It just dropped.
{96942}{97029}It's been playing in my head|for weeks, and it sucks.
{97031}{97063}What is this?
{97064}{97129}This is so '80s|it makes my hair pouf.
{97146}{97183}Hold up. Listen.
{97184}{97260}I produced this video,|and the '80s are back.
{97262}{97302}I don't know|where you've been.
{97304}{97388}Listening to Tchaikovsky,|Mozart, and Chopin.
{97390}{97491}You wouldn't know real music if I|hit you on the head with it, Gooey.
{97520}{97571}You're gonna stop|calling me Gooey.
{97573}{97606}So?
{97639}{97711}What do you think?|- What is it?
{97713}{97768}It's a tutu, silly.
{97770}{97811}For what, a midget?
{97813}{97884}No, for a little girl|named Ray.
{97886}{97942}Her year-end dance recital|i i
{97944}{98007}The costumes are so boring,|I figured I'd surprise her
{98009}{98065}with something|pretty spectacular.
{98348}{98394}He's wearing the jacket!
{98396}{98462}That's my jacket!|I made that jacket!
{98517}{98560}That was my idea!
{98750}{98820}He is the Lizard King|reincarnated.
{98867}{98915}No, listen to me.|Look at me.
{98982}{99029}I'm the lizard king.
{99031}{99086}This guy, he's nothing|but an illusion.
{99088}{99171}He ain't real.|Everything he is, I made.
{99172}{99244}You want real,|you want substance,
{99246}{99308}look no further|than what you got in front of you.
{99310}{99370}I'm the lizard king.
{99422}{99470}You're right, Huey.
{99472}{99527}True friends, true hearts.
{99528}{99584}That is what counts in life.
{99586}{99659}That's right.|Hit me one.
{99660}{99708}Give me some love.
{99766}{99833}That's funny.|I wasn't expecting anyone.
{99835}{99875}Go see who it is.
{99996}{100033}Hey, man.
{100035}{100080}What's going on?
{100229}{100284}Hi. 81 st and 5th, please.
{100638}{100715}When did it happen?|- He passed away this afternoon.
{101140}{101189}I'm so sorry.
{101458}{101497}You promised.
{101613}{101699}Miss Gunn, Mrs. Schleine|is waiting for you in the study.
{101808}{101881}I'm so sorry, Mrs. Schleine.|- Thanks for coming, Miss Gunn.
{101883}{101923}Are you kidding?
{101925}{101979}Nothing could keep me away|at a time like this.
{101980}{102039}Last week's pay|and a month's severance.
{102082}{102116}Severance?
{102118}{102164}We're letting you go.
{102213}{102243}"We"?
{102244}{102295}That's right.|Me and Ray.
{102297}{102376}We.|Good night, Miss Gunn.
{102444}{102538}I'm sorry, but I'm not leaving|without an explanation.
{102632}{102694}I don't know what's been going on|between you and my daughter,
{102696}{102762}but she has made it clear|she never wants to see you again.
{102764}{102832}She must be going|out of her mind with grief.
{102834}{102887}Actually, she's taking it|rather well.
{102889}{102977}I was at my staff meeting when I|got the news about my husband.
{102979}{103048}I came home to find Ray|finishing her homework.
{103050}{103142}She's been very calm|and level-headed about this whole affair.
{103177}{103235}You call that taking it well?
{103272}{103355}Do you know what "ètage"|your daughter's at in ballet?
{103394}{103450}Or that she was banned|from her science class
{103452}{103555}for stealing a formaldehyde pig|so she could give it a proper burial?
{103568}{103614}The tea set you got her...
{103616}{103685}it's exquisite and beautiful,
{103687}{103744}but do you know|how she likes to have her tea,
{103746}{103808}how many lumps...|one, two... cream, sugar?
{103810}{103862}And the point|of your little tirade is...
{103864}{103891}You're right.
{103916}{103990}You don't know what goes on|between me and Ray
{103992}{104092}because you don't know very much|about your own daughter.
{104094}{104172}I know my daughter well enough|to respect her wishes.
{104222}{104273}You don't give her respect.
{104275}{104366}You give her whatever she asks for|so you don't have to deal with her.
{104411}{104455}She's eight years old.
{104480}{104529}She is not 28.
{104620}{104706}Please remember that the next time|you show her some respect.
{104962}{105046}It's my muse.|- Getting in your way again.
{105118}{105166}Molly, I came here to see you.
{105191}{105223}For what?
{105244}{105315}I haven't been able to write|a single decent song
{105316}{105367}since we last saw each other.
{105400}{105491}Molly, I'm sorry. I was trying|to take a step forward,
{105492}{105548}but I took two steps|backward instead.
{105549}{105588}Why don't you take|one step sideways?
{105590}{105660}Then we can stop doing|this silly little dance.
{105712}{105765}So that's the Molly M.O.
{105767}{105822}When I'm not ready,|you hunt me down.
{105824}{105885}When I try and make it work,|you're not interested.
{105944}{106033}Ever since we met,|it's about what I'm doing wrong...
{106063}{106116}...but I'm not the one|with the problem.
{106118}{106198}You are,|you and your selfishness.
{106200}{106256}All you do is take.
{106279}{106356}I've got nothing for you|right now, so...
{106358}{106448}maybe it's time to start thinking|about someone other than yourself.
{106450}{106481}Till then...
{106720}{106764}Good morning,|ladies and gentlemen.
{106772}{106840}Now we'll start the bidding|on this important collection
{106841}{106927}representing a vital chapter|in American musical history.
{106928}{107020}Tommy Gunn was an essential|member of several landmark bands.
{107022}{107066}He scored a solo hit|with "Molly Smiles...
{107068}{107148}Maybe we should wait a few minutes|till everyone shows up.
{107150}{107239}I'm afraid this is about as good|as it's going to get.
{107240}{107296}We have here Tommy Gunn's|signature acoustic,
{107297}{107365}which he played with his first band|in Haight-Ashbury.
{107367}{107451}Bidding starts at $2,500.|Do I hear $2,500?
{107453}{107501}2,500.|- I have $2,500.
{107503}{107548}Do I hear $2,600?|- 2,500?
{107550}{107588}2,600.|- Thank you.
{107590}{107622}2,500?
{107624}{107703}I'm sorry. We put out feelers,|but unfortunately
{107704}{107774}the excitement generated|by Mr. Gunn's memorabilia
{107776}{107849}fell somewhat short|of expectations.
{107851}{107877}I have 3,000.
{107879}{107927}3,000 going once,
{107929}{107964}3,000 going twice...
{107965}{108054}75,000!|I have an offer of 75,000...
{108056}{108116}from a buyer who wishes|to remain anonymous...
{108118}{108167}for the entire collection.
{108316}{108384}Well? What do you say?
{108412}{108455}It's up to you.
{108472}{108545}Frankly, I can't envision|a much better result
{108547}{108596}from selling it off piecemeal.
{108611}{108705}This is everything that he's|left behind in the whole world.
{108773}{108821}This is my dad.
{108840}{108868}I'm sorry.
{109019}{109074}Just get rid of it.
{109286}{109321}Molly, where are you taking me?
{109372}{109425}The fellas are waiting for us|at the club.
{109427}{109494}The fellas can wait, Huey.
{109496}{109537}This is important.
{109539}{109611}Hold up.|Molly, please.
{109612}{109675}They better have|a defibrillator up there.
{109676}{109751}Gooey, suck it up.|It's good for your heinie.
{109770}{109848}Welcome|to Le Château Chez Molly.
{109961}{110016}This is...|- It's my new apartment.
{110017}{110094}This way is the kitchen area,
{110096}{110143}and over here|in this direction,
{110145}{110247}you'll find the very private,|secluded bathroom section.
{110249}{110293}Fabulous, huh?
{110295}{110375}You're standing in the living room,|which, coincidentally,
{110376}{110414}happens to be...
{110465}{110500}...the bedroom.
{110523}{110561}It's got potential, huh?
{110563}{110625}As a detention cell|for convicted felons, maybe.
{110627}{110685}Molly, this isn't you.
{110687}{110741}I can't afford me|anymore, Huey.
{110743}{110809}Nobody's kicking you out.|You can still stay with me.
{110811}{110926}I really have to stand on|my own two feet right now, okay?
{110940}{110964}Okay.
{111049}{111083}Hello?
{111135}{111202}Roma, how would I know|where Ray is?
{111246}{111294}What's going on with Ray?
{111296}{111331}Hold on one second.
{111356}{111381}Thanks.
{111383}{111451}Roma? Hi.|It's Molly.
{111452}{111540}Miss Gunn, I know|that you've been let go,
{111542}{111653}but is there any chance that|you've seen my daughter today?
{111688}{111727}Are you sure?
{111774}{111825}Ray didn't come home|from school.
{111827}{111875}She's been missing ever since.
{111876}{111924}I thought|that she might have...
{111968}{112025}If you hear from her,|please let me know.
{112045}{112088}Huey, talk to her.
{112356}{112423}You all right?|- I'm fine, thanks.
{116080}{116127}It's nice to see you again.|- You, too.
{116129}{116177}I really miss you.|- I miss you.
{116190}{116236}These are crummy circumstances.
{116237}{116274}Molly Gunn?|- Yeah.
{116276}{116311}How you doin'?|- Good.
{116313}{116360}Good to meet you.|- Same here.
{116362}{116451}I saw that kid Neal Fox's video.|Didn't you create his look?
{116452}{116521}No, I just fixed his jacket.
{116523}{116581}I don't know why|everybody's talking about it.
{116583}{116631}Do you do pants, too?
{116632}{116691}Cool leather ones|that aren't over the top?
{116692}{116745}I'm hoping you can hook me up|with a jacket.
{116747}{116807}Not the same one, obviously,|but with a similar vibe.
{116809}{116868}Guys, thank you.|You're very sweet.
{116870}{116946}It was sort of|a big accident, yeah.
{116948}{117014}It's a hell of an accident.|What do you think?
{117124}{117158}I would love to.|- Cool.
{117160}{117200}Done.|- Pants, too.
{117202}{117260}Guys, Garth Brooks|wants to meet you.
{117261}{117306}You're kidding.|- He's over there.
{117308}{117367}Excuse us. Mr. Brooks?|- Okay. Yeah.
{117368}{117417}Let's go.|- Awesome.
{118228}{118253}Thanks.
{118360}{118423}No, that's yours.
{118425}{118501}Molly, I just spoke with her.
{118503}{118560}She's almost ready|to meet with people,
{118561}{118631}but she wants|to talk to you first.
{118828}{118890}You can have|your job back, you know.
{118916}{118961}I don't think so.
{118978}{119014}You and I...
{119044}{119099}...we're gonna be friends.
{119100}{119133}Okay?
{119192}{119261}Grownups never stay friends|with kids.
{119293}{119354}I don't see any grownups|around here.
{119415}{119451}I do.
{119534}{119595}You know the Dalai Lama?
{119616}{119691}I've always thought of myself|as a people person.
{119693}{119795}Most Fashion Institute applicants|would kill for references like yours.
{119796}{119844}Seems to me|you could skip school
{119846}{119906}and find work with one|of your designer friends.
{119908}{119988}It would be more fun than|toiling away here for four years.
{119989}{120067}Fundamentals are|the building blocks of fun...
{120124}{120163}...I always say.
{120195}{120223}Oh, God.
{120328}{120365}Man, she's gonna kill me.
{120367}{120419}I'm really sorry.
{120420}{120471}Okay. Sorry.
{120472}{120540}Please call me|and I will call you,
{120542}{120600}and thank you.
{120602}{120651}Have a great day. Bye.
{120677}{120751}She always does this to me.|She's not coming.
{120772}{120819}If you'd quit wiggling your ass,
{120821}{120875}it wouldn't have fallen off|in the first place.
{121090}{121123}Coming through.
{121165}{121189}Excuse me.
{121287}{121361}To conclude our program,|we present a special performance...
{121363}{121418}Are you okay?|- By Laraine Schleine.
{121636}{121680}And to accompany Miss Schleine,
{121682}{121776}we are pleased to present|a very special guest.
{122276}{122311}How's it going?
{122386}{122465}There's someone here today|who lent us a bit of her magic,
{122467}{122560}and now we'd like|to give some of it back.
{122623}{122671}This was Tommy Gunn's|favorite guitar,
{122672}{122736}and I'm going to sing you|the song he wrote
{122738}{122802}for his favorite person|in the world.
{122828}{122881}This one goes out|to Molly Gunn.
{122978}{123044}Daddy's little girl
{123060}{123155}Paints the world|with her magic wand
{123156}{123228}Daddy's little child
{123251}{123407}Breathes new life|to the morning time for me
{123408}{123454}Though we're apart
{123456}{123506}Her thoughts follow me
{123508}{123553}When I come home
{123555}{123646}Molly smiles with the dawn
{123648}{123696}Molly smiles
{123698}{123831}And she radiates a glow|around her halo
{123832}{123911}When she plays,|Molly smiles
{123913}{123972}On a summer day
{123973}{124020}Molly smiles
{124021}{124123}A new day,|Molly smiles
{124269}{124342}Daddy's little girl
{124361}{124460}Ties a ribbon|around my heart
{124462}{124547}Daddy's little child
{124548}{124623}Waves good-bye|to the ocean tide
{124624}{124709}That sweeps me
{124711}{124753}Though we're apart
{124756}{124826}She's a part of me
{124855}{124945}Molly smiles|with the dawn
{124947}{124995}Molly smiles
{124997}{125131}And she radiates a glow|around her halo
{125133}{125212}When she plays,|Molly smiles
{125214}{125272}On a summer day
{125274}{125319}Molly smiles
{125320}{125429}A new day,|Molly smiles
{126434}{126527}Molly smiles|with the dawn
{126528}{126567}Molly smiles
{126568}{126707}And she radiates a glow|around her halo
{126708}{126787}When she plays,|Molly smiles
{126788}{126848}On a summer day
{126850}{126877}Molly smiles
{126903}{127005}A new day,|Molly smiles
{127007}{127067}Every story has an end,
{127069}{127110}but in life,
{127112}{127168}every ending|is just a new beginning.
{127170}{127381}Nothing's wrong|when Molly smiles
