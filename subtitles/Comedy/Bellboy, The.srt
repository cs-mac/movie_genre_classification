1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,829
Hello. Allow me to introduce myself.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,036
I am Jackie Mulchen,

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,591
the executive producer in charge
of all productions here at Paramount.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,311
And before showing this picture,
I thought I should at least explain.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,268
The motion picture you're about to see
isn't the run-of-the-mill film fare

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,228
that has been presented
to the movie going public of late.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,159
It's quite easy
making this type of picture,

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,517
filled with love, emotion and tears.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,910
And of course, we could easily
make the space...

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,479
...violence...

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,633
...and horror films that are enjoyed
by many peoples of the world.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,915
But we chose to make
what you're about to see.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,038
A film based on fun.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,832
And it's just a little different
insofar as there is no story and no plot.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,437
That's right. I said no story, no plot.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,275
It is actually a series of silly sequences.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,352
Or you might say it is a visual diary

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,832
of a few weeks in the life of a real nut.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,671
And it's real silly.

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,518
Oh, put it on. Show it to 'em. Put it on!

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,876
<i>This is Walter Winchell reporting,</i>

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,190
<i>and this is Miami Beach at night.</i>

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,511
<i>The nights here are the same
as anywhere else.</i>

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,399
<i>No sun.</i>

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,836
<i>This is the same Miami Beach, daytime.</i>

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,437
<i>It is just waking up,
rubbing the sand out of its palms,</i>

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,479
<i>ready for another "let's be pretty
for the tourists" day,</i>

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,437
<i>a day that could never get started</i>

29
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,431
<i>without the people who provide
the services</i>

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,878
<i>that are required in order
that the visitor is satisfied.</i>

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,634
<i>The people who serve
are the real backbone,</i>

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,475
<i>the people who serve and work
in order that you might pay...</i>

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,437
<i>... that is, play.</i>

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,993
Company... halt!

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,076
<i>And of course, there are chefs,
chambermaids, clerks, hostesses,</i>

36
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,800
<i>waiters, doormen,
bartenders, waitresses,</i>

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,155
<i>musicians and entertainers.</i>

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,956
<i>But these men are
the real unsung heroes of a hotel,</i>

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,873
<i>the men who have no real direction.</i>

40
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,395
<i>They are called on day and night,
for anything,</i>

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,154
<i>from burping babies
to walking the dog.</i>

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,676
<i>These are the men who are
almost always called upon</i>

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,799
<i>for services above and beyond
the call of duty.</i>

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,599
<i>Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
I call them men,</i>

45
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,230
<i>but everyone else
calls for... the bellboy.</i>

46
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,278
<i>As the bellboys break ranks, they all
know where to go and what to do.</i>

47
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,476
<i>That is, most of them.</i>

48
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,111
How are you?

49
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,317
Here, Stanley. Get everything
out of the trunk.

50
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,357
George, come help me.

51
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,795
Hello? Hello?

52
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,678
Hello, Mr Hartman. How are you?

53
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,832
- Yes, we...
- I need a couple of guys...

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes, we have your trunks.

55
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,474
I can't hear very well.
What did you say?

56
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,471
Oh, yes, of course.

57
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,713
We've got beautiful accommodations.
I'm sure you'll be happy with them.

58
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,997
We'd be delighted to see you. Yes.

59
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,390
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

60
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,750
- I'm Mr Carter. I have a reservation.
- Yes, sir, Mr Carter. Sign here, please.

61
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,150
It's nice to have you with us again.

62
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,518
Unfortunately, I can't stay too long.
This has to be a hit-and-run vacation.

63
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,468
We certainly hope you enjoy your stay.
Front boy!

64
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,677
Mr Carter is in Room 625.

65
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,590
We certainly hope you enjoy your stay,
Miss Winkly.

66
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,352
Front boy!

67
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,118
Miss Winkly is in Room 626.

68
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,189
It's so nice to see you again,
Mrs Hartong. Let me help you.

69
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,748
You're very lucky. We've been having
wonderful weather, Mrs Hartong.

70
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,071
Here we go, that's it. Easy.

71
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,117
That's it now.

72
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,076
Boy, open that bag
and hang those things up in the closet.

73
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,431
Well, if it isn't Mrs Hartong
back with us again.

74
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,797
I hope it isn't because of dieting again.

75
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,916
Don't you fret. We'll do all we can.

76
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,674
But you'll have to stay away
from the candy.

77
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,637
- I know, I know.
- Good.

78
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,509
Clerk, the key to Room 988
for Mrs Hartong, please.

79
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,434
I'm sure you'll be very happy
in the new wing, Mrs Hartong.

80
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,836
I'd like to leave a forwarding address.

81
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,399
Certainly.

82
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,275
Two weeks certainly did fly by,
Mrs Hartong.

83
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,032
They certainly did.

84
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,794
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

85
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,791
You kept away from the candy.

86
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,713
- Goodbye, Mr Novak. Thank you.
- Goodbye.

87
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,113
Move that car over.
Pull it over, that's it.

88
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,717
Now move the other one!
What a day I've put in.

89
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,599
Oh, Mrs Hartong,
I didn't recognise you.

90
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,957
You look crazy. I mean, great.

91
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,157
Thank you, Carl.
Has my uncle's car arrived yet?

92
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,595
Not yet, Mrs Hartong.
I'll call and check.

93
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,159
Thank you.

94
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,913
Mrs Hartong is right here.

95
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,789
Mrs Hartong, your uncle asked
if you would please wait.

96
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,155
He'll be here in 20 minutes.

97
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,880
- That'll be fine. I'll wait.
- All right.

98
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,918
Mrs Hartong said it'll be fine. Thank you.

99
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,071
- Would you care to sit here?
- Thank you.

100
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,193
Stanley, you've been at this
for 40 minutes. Get going, will you?

101
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,668
I don't mind you helping the guys.
But you've been here for over an hour.

102
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,071
Get back to the bell desk.
On the double!

103
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,073
Stanley!

104
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,916
- I don't get it.
- Get what?

105
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,798
This kid loves his work.

106
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,358
Now you've got that done, please be
good enough... Let me rephrase that.

107
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,152
To keep you out of mischief, set up
the seats for the motion picture tonight.

108
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,199
Stanley, we don't talk back.
Get along, get along.

109
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,318
What is it?
I've never seen you laugh so hard.

110
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,675
I've got Stanley
on theatre seating duty.

111
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,035
Alone?
How long has he been in there?

112
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,953
I just sent him.
It'll take two or three days.

113
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,112
- Let's go and watch.
- OK. Let's go.

114
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,436
He's fast.

115
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,077
Mr Novak, I'm so excited. I've never
seen a movie star up close before.

116
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,559
Enjoy yourself.

117
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,233
It's Jerry Lewis.

118
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,710
Mother used to take me to see him
when I was a kid.

119
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,916
He'll be here in a moment.

120
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,550
Be sure that all the accommodations
are exactly as he ordered.

121
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,109
Whatever you do, be pleasant.

122
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,352
There he is. Places, everybody. Places.

123
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,314
- No autographs, please.
- Stand back, folks.

124
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,516
Stand back. No autographs.

125
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,474
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

126
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,555
- Is this where we register?
- Yes, sir. Right this way.

127
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,395
Hold it. Hold it!

128
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,790
Hold it. Back. Hold it.

129
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,110
Hold it. Hold it!

130
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,071
Stop with the brushing.

131
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,196
We've been together a long time.

132
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,272
I've asked you many things
and you've come through for me.

133
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,991
Now I'm asking you to hold it.
Stop pushing, stop rushing, just hold it.

134
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,278
We're all adults and I'll expect you all
to conduct yourselves as an adult will.

135
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,718
Hold it. I've never asked you this
but I'm asking you now, simply, purely,

136
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,632
hold it!

137
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,110
I'm a nervous wreck.
Let me have a cigarette.

138
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,670
- Thank you. A light?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,149
All right. All right. All right!

140
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,759
Hold it.

141
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,037
Stop with the brushing.
Another cigarette, please.

142
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,156
I'll smoke it dry.

143
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,995
Mr Lewis, we're all excited about
your appearance at the Fontainebleau.

144
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,188
We should be used to celebrities by now.
We've had some of the big ones staying.

145
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,715
Wrong Way Corrigan.

146
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,359
Ma Perkins.

147
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,034
And don't forget Bill Holden's aunt.

148
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,270
Bill Holden's aunt. Yes.

149
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,393
I would like very much, if you don't mind,
to get to my room as soon as possible.

150
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,472
- Did you have a pleasant journey?
- Fine.

151
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,678
He's so funny.

152
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,832
This is the private entrance to the hotel.

153
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,913
Your suite is on the fifth floor and
totally secluded. I'm sure you'll like it.

154
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,559
That's wonderful.

155
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,792
- He's always good for a laugh.
- He sure is funny.

156
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,110
I would like the seclusion and privacy.

157
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,956
I had a terrible mishap a week ago
in the family. An aunt died and...

158
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,196
Nothing like a laugh!

159
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,272
He sure is funny!

160
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,631
- Would you care to register, Mr Lewis?
- I'd like to register and go to the room.

161
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,233
All right!

162
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,913
I need another card.

163
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,311
It's all right. You may register
in your suite. This way.

164
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,357
Thank you very much. I...

165
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,476
Back, back!

166
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,959
Back!

167
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,908
We're gonna go in the elevator and we're
gonna go single file like nice people.

168
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,833
- Remember, hold it. Leon?
- Yes, chief?

169
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,673
- Who are all these people?
- They all work for you.

170
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,910
Who's the guy with the straw hat?

171
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,991
He's the guy that tells you who we are.

172
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,392
That's good. I wouldn't have known.
I got such a bunch of people.

173
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,757
This is a very nice room.
Where's the bed? Oh, it's the elevator.

174
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,797
Wait, don't push.

175
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,678
That's it. Just file in.

176
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,311
Move to your left. That's it. Now let me
get in. Let me get into the side.

177
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,756
That's it. Get off.
You're stepping on my suede...

178
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,638
Will you stop with the brushing?

179
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,316
I'm awfully sorry, Ben. These people
are just so overanxious.

180
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,948
I appreciate it.
You've got to have your staff.

181
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,157
I've got a barber and a gardener
and people assisting me.

182
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,518
When I do the shows I try my best
to do what I can to perform

183
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,389
and I need the elements and
all of these people function for me...

184
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,710
Stop brushing.

185
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,392
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.

186
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,677
But there couldn't be two of them. Right?

187
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,628
Right. Hey, Stanley couldn't be
a Clark Kent, could he?

188
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,234
Don't be silly.

189
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,718
But he could be a Lamont Cranston.

190
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,798
Bell captain.

191
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,396
He didn't? I'm sorry, sir.
Yes, sir, right away.

192
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,039
Front boy.

193
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,955
That brown rawhide bag goes up
to the Lewis entourage. On the double.

194
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,030
Stanley. On the double!

195
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,475
- There you are.
- For me, Mr Berle.

196
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,677
Yes, ma'am. There are a lot
of autograph hounds.

197
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,479
Mr Berle, my little daughter sings.

198
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,677
She sings every time the neighbours
come over. What should I do?

199
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,193
Move.

200
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,558
Deliver this to Milton Berle right away.

201
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,718
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

202
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,235
- Please?
- Sure, young lady.

203
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,838
You know, you look like a girl I know
from New York.

204
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,036
Were you ever...? Just a minute, son.

205
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,350
Are you down here with your mother?

206
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,672
Your mother's down here with you?
Just a minute, son, please.

207
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,796
There you are, young lady.

208
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,311
Would you do me a favour?

209
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,473
You must learn never to interrupt
anybody when they're busy.

210
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,918
I don't care what you want to say, but
you must learn etiquette, politeness.

211
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,719
Don't look over there. Look at me.

212
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,110
Be a good boy. Never interrupt people.

213
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,512
The rudest thing to do is to interrupt
people when they're trying to...

214
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,671
Oh, you have a message for me.

215
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,434
I'm sorry. I didn't know. Here's a tip.

216
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,393
Milton.

217
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,158
Hi, Milt.

218
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,591
What's the matter?

219
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,949
- Milty?
- You wouldn't believe it.

220
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,588
You wouldn't believe it.

221
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,751
Milton, what's the matter?

222
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,352
- Message for Jerry Lewis.
- Right here, boy.

223
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,950
- Mr Lewis.
- Yes?

224
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,239
Thank you.

225
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,517
What's the trouble, sir?

226
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,672
Nothing. You wouldn't understand
or believe it.

227
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,080
There's a lot of kooks in this hotel.

228
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,071
Straighten up there!

229
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,433
Let's go.

230
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,556
- Where's Stanley?
- I don't know.

231
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,190
- We said we'd wait for him.
- We'll miss the first race.

232
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,399
Stanley, the races go on in 20 minutes.
You're off duty now.

233
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,438
- We'll talk later. Let's go.
- Go get dressed.

234
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,353
Let's go. We'll meet you outside.

235
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,994
- Where's Stanley now?
- Who knows?

236
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,720
- Let's go.
- We're late already.

237
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,440
He's a speedy boy!

238
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,031
What do you think, Herkie?

239
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,839
I can't make up my mind.
How about you, Dave?

240
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,310
I'm thinking.
Sonny, how does it look to you?

241
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,278
Well, I don't know.

242
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,194
Looks like our friend Flicka
has vanished again.

243
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,433
- Where did this kid go?
- He probably went to make a bet.

244
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,990
I don't have to go nowhere
to bet he's into mischief.

245
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,277
<i>Attention, please.
May we have your attention?</i>

246
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,150
<i>Due to circumstances beyond our
control we have to cancel the first race.</i>

247
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,596
<i>We are very sorry. Please make
your bets for the second race</i>

248
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,072
<i>and all the first race bets will be
refunded at the windows. Thank you.</i>

249
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,829
Locker room. Is Stanley down there?

250
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,991
OK. Thank you.

251
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,237
Have you seen Stanley
out there by the pool?

252
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,391
All right. Thanks a lot.

253
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,149
Coffee shop. Have you seen Stanley?

254
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,471
Which Stanley?
The only Stanley in the world.

255
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,309
Is there anything I can do for you, sir?

256
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,120
Front boy! Stanley, take over
for a few minutes. I'll be right back.

257
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,360
All right. What's the matter with you?
You've seen pretty girls before.

258
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,114
We've had model conventions before.

259
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,354
When these girls are here in this hotel,
they're treated like any other guest.

260
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,308
What you do during working hours
is our business.

261
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,395
And what you do after working hours
is our business. Don't fool around.

262
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,870
Remember, no girl is that important.

263
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,235
I think.

264
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,792
Mr Novak, you know I'm very faithful
to this hotel and to you.

265
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,398
I do my job and keep from bothering
you with a lot of petty annoyances.

266
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,393
Today, something happened
I've got to tell you about.

267
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,758
When the models convention came
into the hotel, the bellhops lined up

268
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,959
and as the models came in,
every single bellhop grabbed a girl.

269
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,398
They jumped out of line, grabbed a girl.
Every single one of them had a girl.

270
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,950
Except me,
and I think it's pretty darn unfair.

271
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,712
I keep telling you, I keep telling you,
I keep telling you,

272
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,759
and I keep telling you,
stop spending money.

273
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,390
I'll stop spending money
when you stop spending money.

274
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,790
Don't live my life for me.

275
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,952
I wouldn't, except that
I have to live it with you.

276
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,712
- Shut it!
- Shut what?

277
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,110
- Your big mouth.
- My big mouth?

278
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,955
If you measured it,
you'd find my mouth is just a pinhole

279
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,588
compared to the hollow tunnel
you've got.

280
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,513
- You asked for it.
- Don't hit my husband.

281
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,992
Young dog. Where do you come off,
butting in on our business?

282
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,833
Don't you dare! How dare you?

283
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,878
Busybody, nosy.
Mind your own business.

284
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,476
Come on, honey.
Don't pay any attention to him.

285
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,835
He don't know what he's talking about.

286
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,911
My darling!

287
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,596
I'm telling you, either you see to it that
your men are dressed neatly and clean

288
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,830
or there's going to be trouble.

289
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,390
We're not running a gymnasium.
This is a very high-class hotel.

290
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,551
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

291
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,190
- I'll say it again. Neat, clean, nice.
- Yes, sir.

292
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,718
Good taste, good clothes, refinement,
distinction. That is very, very important.

293
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,348
Put this in my cabana.

294
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,639
Bell captain.

295
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,156
No, sir, I'm sorry,
you'll have to call room service.

296
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,515
Company, halt!

297
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,035
- Left face!
- Left face!

298
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,829
This will be a half-hour break.
March! Hup, hup, hup!

299
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,599
Bell captain.

300
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,157
Sit down. There's no one there.
What do you want? A green light?

301
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,197
Sit down and eat your food.

302
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,392
And shut up!

303
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,790
As I was saying,
when someone pushes you around

304
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,315
and keeps pushing you around,

305
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,756
soon you're not gonna be around
to get pushed around.

306
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,435
- Bravo. Bravo!
- You're always right, boss.

307
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,591
Remember what I'm telling you.

308
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,118
Go tell Dead Eye to take it easy
or else it's gonna be very hot.

309
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,638
I think you're wrong. We're not gonna
get anywhere with muscling anybody.

310
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,394
Things today are different
than they were.

311
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,120
Why can't you just be sweet?

312
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,353
"Can't you just be sweet?"
I don't want to be sweet!

313
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,114
I want to be the way I always was -
miserable.

314
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,717
I want to be like they say on television,
"an ornery critter".

315
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,678
Now remember what I'm telling you.

316
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,877
Get hold of Dead Eye
and kick a hole in his chest.

317
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,271
Knock his brains out,
bite his jugular vein.

318
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,432
And remember one thing. No violence.

319
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,397
Here's a kid with an honest face.
Tell me, am I right or are they right?

320
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,437
There, you see? I'm right.

321
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,149
That's what I like.
A kid what's got class.

322
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,190
Esther, if we don't get a room

323
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,716
I'm getting the first plane back
to New York in the morning.

324
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,474
I'm completely exhausted.

325
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,949
You and your bright ideas.

326
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,750
I don't blame you, but it wasn't my fault
they didn't receive the telegram.

327
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,876
Look, Dottie, I have an idea. That old
boyfriend of mine, Bob Clayton?

328
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,238
He's a bell captain here. I bet
he can find accommodations for us.

329
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,597
You just relax.
I'll be back in a minute. OK?

330
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,158
Stanley!

331
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,357
I couldn't care less
about your problems.

332
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,511
I've got a very responsible position.

333
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,036
I'm in charge of all the transportation
for this hotel.

334
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,758
Yes, I know, but...

335
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,118
Look, I don't give a darn.
We're going to work this thing out...

336
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,192
Either you do it the way I say or...

337
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,239
...you can come here and
we'll try to straighten it out, sir.

338
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,391
Yes, sir, thank you very much.

339
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,031
- Mr Novak, about this call...
- Never mind. This is more important.

340
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,998
We're responsible
for the actions of your boys.

341
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,596
At all times, you are to see to it
that they conduct themselves

342
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,389
in a manner befitting a man wearing
the uniform of the Fontainebleau!

343
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,198
Count on me.

344
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,273
I'll keep them out of the strip joints
if it's the last thing I do.

345
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,311
<i>And now, friends and folks,</i>

346
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,632
<i>we're glad to present
those terrific fellas, the Novelites.</i>

347
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,918
Howdy, neighbours. It's sure good
this evening. I got a surprise for you.

348
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,071
I brought a couple of kinfolk along.

349
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,439
On my right is my old happy cousin,
Smiley McCoy. Come out, Smiley boy.

350
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,876
Doggone, it's sure good to see you,
you little maverick, you.

351
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,589
Doggone, you're looking mighty fine,
Smiley boy.

352
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,877
Do me a favour. Take a step forward.
These are nice people sitting out here.

353
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,350
Don't be afraid.
Take yourself a step forward.

354
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,593
Tell you what to do, Smiley. Take a big
old step forward and give the folks...

355
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,030
- Ah-ah!
- Oh, God.

356
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,192
Just take a step forward.
That ain't too much.

357
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:20,115
Take a little bitty step forward and
give them your Arthur Murray smile.

358
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,070
We're gonna feature Zeke on the guitar.

359
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,708
He's gonna take hold of that guitar
and twang it for you.

360
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,236
Gonna grab that guitar,
he gon' twang it for ya...

361
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,473
As a matter of fact, he's gonna take hold
of that little old guitar, folks,

362
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,790
he gonna twang-twang it for you.

363
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,428
Grab guitar, twang-twang a little bit!

364
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,035
I tell you, he gonna grab hold
of that guitar down there,

365
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,317
twist it up, tune it up,
gonna twang-twang-twang it for you!

366
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,074
Grab it, gonna twangy-twang-twang!

367
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,397
- Look, I'm trying...
- Ah!

368
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,391
What's the matter? He's gonna grab
that guitar, gonna twang-feet it for you!

369
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,120
Flang-flip-wibba-bum!

370
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,670
We're about set do a song
entitled "The Alabama Jubilee".

371
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,831
- You ready there?
- Ready.

372
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,072
<i>And here's the little doll you've
all been waiting for, Rock Candy!</i>

373
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,559
I can't tell you
how upset I am about this.

374
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,030
You're upset? I have to go back
to New York and do a TV show.

375
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,236
Relax, Mr Sedley, relax.

376
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,188
Relax, my eye. I'm going to find out
who did this terrible thing to me.

377
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,238
He has ruined my entire career.

378
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,470
You can sit here, son.

379
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,190
It's OK. Sit here. I'm through.

380
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,592
Hi, Stanley.

381
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,596
Hey, gang!

382
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,356
There's a crazy guy having lunch down
the bottom of the pool. Take a look!

383
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,753
Front boy.

384
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,799
Stanley, see that steamer trunk?
Go down there and get me...

385
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,350
Stanley, you never let me finish
what I'm going to say.

386
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,593
If you had listened, you would know
that I did not want the steamer trunk.

387
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,115
I wanted what was
on the steamer trunk.

388
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,795
If you'd listened and waited,
you'd have found out

389
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,192
that I wanted the hatbox
that was sitting on the steamer trunk.

390
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,433
You dashed away before
you gave me a chance to explain.

391
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,160
Go back, put the steamer trunk back

392
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,437
and get me the hatbox
that is sitting on...

393
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,919
Stanley!

394
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,992
...that is sitting on the steamer trunk.

395
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,518
All right, go... Stanley!

396
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,952
Thank you, Stanley.

397
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,071
Would you like a bite?

398
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,071
This is delicious.

399
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,356
Greatest apples in the world.

400
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,753
Only one place you get these apples.

401
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,435
You go down here...make a left.

402
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,870
Sure you don't want...?

403
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,837
Just wonderful.

404
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,638
<i>Mother,
I've been here almost six weeks,</i>

405
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,396
<i>and all I've been able to do so far
is go to the movies, and alone,</i>

406
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,120
<i>or just sit around the pool.</i>

407
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,679
<i>What, Mother?</i>

408
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:16,597
<i>No, there aren't any nice young
people I'd like to go out with.</i>

409
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,153
<i>They're either after my money or they
just want to drive my Rolls-Royce.</i>

410
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,552
<i>So until I find a nice, quiet,
unassuming someone</i>

411
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,269
<i>who's only interested in me
and not my millions,</i>

412
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,908
<i>I'll have to go to the movies.</i>

413
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:38,518
<i>Because remember, Mother,
movies are your best entertainment.</i>

414
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,717
<i>Give my best to everyone
in Australia.</i>

415
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,276
<i>All right, Mother, be well, and
I'll call you again in ten minutes.</i>

416
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,078
<i>Goodbye.</i>

417
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,790
Where were you when I needed you?
Get your hand off.

418
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,395
Am I to understand the suite
for Mr and Mrs Manville isn't ready?

419
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,551
- I'm sorry.
- Where are they?

420
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,312
Right over there, sir.

421
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,190
Mr and Mrs Manville, sorry the suite
wasn't ready when you arrived.

422
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,115
That's perfectly all right, Mr Novak.
We understand, but we won't for long.

423
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,274
Speak for yourself. I'm anxious to
get to the room and open my presents.

424
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,434
Please, hold on a little longer.
Your suite will be ready in half an hour.

425
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,353
Couldn't we have one room
in 15 minutes?

426
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,397
I'll check again, Mrs Manville.

427
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,189
What difference does it make?
We're content, aren't we?

428
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,273
Of course, Ferdinand,
but we were engaged for 13 years.

429
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,271
Now that we're married...

430
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,479
We're all set. If you just follow me,
I'll show you to your suite.

431
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,990
- Oops.
- Oh, God.

432
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,753
Oh, my back!

433
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,912
Oh, my back!

434
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,469
Mr Clayton, how did this happen?

435
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,111
All I know is that Stanley spilled
something and was waxing it over...

436
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,078
Oh, my back.

437
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,113
I understand, but did you call the valet?

438
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,078
Oh, I see.
He must be making his rounds.

439
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,754
In that case, if you just call him again...

440
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,391
Yes, sir, I see. We'll have a boy
up there right away. Thank you.

441
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,916
Front boy! 877, Mr Wheal, pick up.

442
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,150
Take these pants
and have them pressed right away.

443
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,313
I have a heavy date tonight
and I'll give you a heavy tip.

444
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,311
No, dear.

445
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,193
But I only...

446
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,437
But you only...

447
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,959
Yes, dear.

448
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,275
<i>Once again, this is Barney Shank
at the 18th green,</i>

449
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:04,319
<i>bringing you the final minutes
of this exciting $25,000 Open</i>

450
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,916
<i>with the two finalists, Jack Keller
and Dr Cary Middlecoff.</i>

451
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,594
<i>Middlecoff is making his approach.</i>

452
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,991
<i>Here goes the backswing
and the ball is lofted high in the air.</i>

453
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,230
<i>It's going in...</i>

454
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:21,199
<i>It must be about three feet away.
A beautiful, beautiful approach shot.</i>

455
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,078
<i>Just gorgeous.</i>

456
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,800
<i>Beautiful day for the game today.</i>

457
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,873
<i>It's very still, very quiet.
Everyone most anxious.</i>

458
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,711
<i>Here's Jack Keller putting.</i>

459
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,433
<i>There it goes. It was beautiful.</i>

460
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,630
That putt put Jack Keller even
with Dr Cary Middlecoff.

461
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,268
If Cary Middlecoff makes this putt,

462
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,194
it's like shooting fish in a barrel
for old Dead Eye Middlecoff.

463
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,318
It will mean
the 18-hole playoff tomorrow

464
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,836
for the big $25,000 purse.

465
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,832
This has certainly been
a gorgeous day today.

466
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,278
And there's a lot of money depending
on this next putt, folks.

467
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,953
A lot of money.

468
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,069
Now the crowd is all settled.
No one is even breathing.

469
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,957
He's lining up the putt.

470
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,395
He sets himself.

471
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,916
And ladies and gentlemen,
here is the big one.

472
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,677
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, Hal. You're a little late.

473
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,674
Yeah, I had a big date.
Just me, the chick and the full moon.

474
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,877
- Now you hit me where I live.
- You mean the chick?

475
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,352
No, no, the full moon. You know
how I am about that astronomy jazz.

476
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,479
An old Greek astronomer said that
when the man in the moon is smiling,

477
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,313
all the stars and planets
are swinging.

478
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,268
Mercury warms up a little bit more.
Jupiter starts jumping.

479
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,113
Venus puts on a new hairdo
or manicure.

480
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,512
All the stars and planets are having
a great, big party up there in the sky.

481
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,069
<i>Sylvia, get up. The sun is shining
and it's a beautiful day.</i>

482
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,800
<i>Are you crazy?
It's 3.30 in the morning.</i>

483
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,829
<i>For the money it's costing, we'll
take the sun whenever they give it to us.</i>

484
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,877
Stanley, Mr Novak wants to see you,
on the double.

485
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,392
Check on that shipment. And send
that wire to New York. It's important.

486
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,719
Hello?

487
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,190
Oh, the senator. Senator Tyson.
Yes, put him on.

488
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,713
Just a moment.

489
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,795
Go to the airport. The captain of
the National Airlines jet just flew in.

490
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,350
He left his briefcase in the cockpit
of the plane. Go and get it.

491
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,876
It's at Gate 39.
Hurry up. Go on, go on.

492
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,916
Hello, Senator. How are you?

493
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,278
<i>Last call for passengers, Flight 104
for Chicago and Los Angeles.</i>

494
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,317
<i>Now loading Gate 5.</i>

495
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,118
<i>Last call for passengers, Flight 104
for Chicago and Los Angeles.</i>

496
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,078
<i>Now loading Gate 5. Last call.</i>

497
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,238
We are sorry
we cannot accommodate you

498
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,473
but shall be happy to be of service
in the future. Cordially yours...

499
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:46,272
Hello? Yes, this is Mr Novak.

500
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,351
Yes.

501
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:53,674
Sorry, we have 3,000 employees.
I couldn't know every one of them.

502
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,270
Oh, Stanley? Yes, he works for me.

503
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,153
He what?

504
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,631
I just saw one man on the floor.
Where is everybody?

505
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,998
They're inside having a meeting at
the round table. Looks like trouble.

506
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,550
I say one thing.
Striking is a matter of principle.

507
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,631
Then let the principles strike.

508
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,189
The seating at separate tables,
no fraternisation.

509
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,954
And the bell captain
and his storm-trooper tactics.

510
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,032
What we do after work is our business,
not theirs.

511
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,159
You're right. They shouldn't tell us to stay
out of strip joints. I like strippers.

512
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,029
Remember, fellas,
the decision must be made now.

513
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,479
A-ha! So you're the ringleader.
I've caught you at last.

514
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,791
I thought you were
a nice, quiet young man,

515
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,394
and I find you're just a troublemaker.

516
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,269
This is how you treat me.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

517
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,797
I've given you a home away from home.
Yes, I have, you know I have.

518
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,155
And this is the way you repay me.

519
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,595
You're nothing but a strike creator.

520
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,478
Yes, a troublemaker,

521
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,757
an instigator, a picket-plugger,
yes, you are.

522
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,232
Stop shaking your head. What's
the matter with you? Can't you talk?

523
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:53,114
Certainly I can talk. I suspect I can talk
as well as any other man, Mr Novak.

524
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:59,069
In that case...how is it we never
heard you talk before?

525
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,070
Because no one ever asked me.

526
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,758
<i>So you see? There was no story.</i>

527
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,595
<i>But there is a moral,
and a simple one.</i>

528
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:28,675
<i>You'll never know the next guy's
story... unless you ask.</i>
