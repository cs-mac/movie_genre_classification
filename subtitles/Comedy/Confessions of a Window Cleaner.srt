1
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,003
<i>Hi, I'm Timmy Lee. It is
My first day of cleaning windows.</i>

2
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,123
<i>Ever thought about window cleaners ?</i>

3
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,971
<i>They spend their days
looking into hundreds of little boxes,</i>

4
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,562
<i>many of which have got people in.
sorts of people.</i>

5
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,082
<i>That's me !
What about that physique, eh ?</i>

6
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,930
<i>A bit Steve McQueen, isn't it ?</i>

7
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,246
<i>No wonder the birds go crazy for me.</i>

8
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,602
<i>Favourite gear
a white nylon T-shirt.</i>

9
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,122
<i>Because when you wet it, you can
press it up against the window.</i>

10
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,890
<i>And then give them a little smile.</i>

11
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,483
<i>Well, nice for the old ones.
Makes all sort of Remembrance Day.</i>

12
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,643
<i>Still, you can't expect to go potty
on your first day, can you ?</i>

13
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,487
<i>Cor, cop a load of that, eh ?
What a knocker factory !</i>

14
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,402
<i>She's obviously a pushover
for my brand of animal magnetism.</i>

15
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,284
Piss off !

16
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,647
Whoops ! Lost my balance.

17
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,164
<i>And my bucket.</i>

18
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,970
<i>Some of the things you see
are quite an education.</i>

19
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,727
<i>I mean, just look at that shower !
But may, they're big for their age.</i>

20
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,524
<i>They're also Mg for my age.</i>

21
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,842
<i>But all this was nothing to what I saw
in a shop down the high street.</i>

22
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,166
<i>It all started with a little bit
of window undressing.</i>

23
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,971
<i>I 'vo heard of your work gelling on lop of
you, but not you gelling on lop of your work !</i>

24
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,647
<i>What a diabolical way
to start a new career.</i>

25
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,684
<i>Flat on me back,
staring up blokes' trouser legs.</i>

26
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,724
<i>And along comes this bird. If it hadn't been
for her, I might have jacked it in right away.</i>

27
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,561
Because she awoke in me deep-rooted
feelings of sensilivily and delicacy

28
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,604
<i>I never knew ! had.
Never knew I could say.</i>

29
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,081
<i>In fact, one look at Elizabeth
and I fell like a pal ! of lead knickers.</i>

30
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,402
<i>She was the type of girl you say,
"Please, may I ? before you give her one.</i>

31
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,965
<i>A card, I mean.</i>

32
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,647
<i>Because Sid did promise me a piece of
the action with any new customers. Cori</i>

33
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,446
<i>Wouldn't have minded
a place of her action.</i>

34
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,603
What are you trying to do, ruin me ?

35
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,849
One broken window,
one bucketed traffic warden

36
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,045
threatening to sue, and now you
tell me you lost your squeegee.

37
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,129
I must've dropped it under the crowd.
And that’s another thing.

38
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,049
I pay you to clean windows.

39
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,689
If you wanna lie on the floor and look up
skirts, you do it in your own time, right ?

40
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,451
But I told you, it was shock. They
were having it off in the window.

41
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,166
So ? Have you got
a sax hang-up or something ?

42
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,089
Ho, but I thought
she had three legs.

43
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,120
Look, Timmy boy, in our business
you've got to be Immune from shocks,

44
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,291
especially from birds,
three-legged or one-legged.

45
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,290
As long as they are
satisfied customers ...

46
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,967
they bring in new ones.

47
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,891
Hey, I met a real
knockout this morning.

48
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,687
Fabulous face, fantastic body,
legs right up to her armpits.

49
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,848
- What about her windows ?
- Windows ?

50
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,371
Oh, I gave her a card.

51
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,086
It’s no good
just chatting up dolly birds.

52
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,090
You've gotta grease the old hags too.

53
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,571
It’s not all Raquel Welch pulling
you onto her dumplings, you know.

54
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,728
Christ, what also did you do ?

55
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,531
Hello. As we were passing, I just thought
I'd stop and see If you were all right.

56
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,961
These falls can sometimes
have delayed affects.

57
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,288
Oh, yes. I mean, no !

58
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,289
Thank you,
I'm all right.

59
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,962
Fina. Well, I have to get back
on patrol now. Good night.

60
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,251
What's all that, then ?
It was her.

61
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,886
Who ?
The bird, I told you.

62
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,085
Have you gone stark raving bonkers,
trying to chat up female fuzz ?

63
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,648
I didn't know who she was. But I don't care, Sid.
Oh, Isn't she a knockout ?

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,524
Oh, yeah, you picked
the right word, boy.

65
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,210
What I wouldn't do for her.

66
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,210
Well, I'm more worried about what
you wouldn't do for my customers.

67
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,565
What do you mean, eh ?

68
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,926
I mean, I've got to he sure, If some
bird offers to squeeze out your chamole,

69
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,361
you don't go retracting your ladder !

70
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,528
Christ, anyone would think
I was a bloody virgin

71
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,370
I do. And so does Rosie.

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,764
What does she know, eh ?

73
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,724
Sisters always know.

74
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,084
I don't know what you're on about.
Responsibilities, that’s what.

75
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,282
You taking over some of mina.

76
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,725
I mean, with Roeie pregnant, I feel it’s
only proper I should cut it out for a while.

77
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,001
Window cleaning ?

78
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,884
Not cleaning,
you hark !

79
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,128
Servicing, keeping the customers happy.

80
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,970
Oh. Anything
I can do, Sid ?

81
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,164
Yeah, well, that’s what worry me.
Can you do ?

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,725
Oh, come off it, Sidi

83
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,247
Never mind 'Come off it.'
Have you ever been on it ?

84
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,441
Of course I have !

85
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,486
Yeah ? I don't reckon you could dip your
tassel in a fire bucket without instructions.

86
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,761
Vary funny, Sid.

87
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,609
All right, Timmo. After dinner,
you and me are going out.

88
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,881
What for ?

89
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,929
To get a professional opinion.

90
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,329
<i>Mind you, I didn't like
it to admit it, but Sid was right.</i>

91
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,081
<i>My sex wife held as much sensation
as a concrete contraceptive.</i>

92
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,444
<i>In fact, I could describe myself as
the walking answer to contraception.</i>

93
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,880
<i>I don't do It !</i>

94
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,121
<i>With me, it’s more a can of good
kiss, good fool and good night.</i>

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,810
<i>Now I will say ! Sid.</i>

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,651
<i>I mean, he really deserved
the Queen's Award for Industry.</i>

97
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,690
Oh, God. I don't know why your old man
works in the lost property off too.

98
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,530
Might just as well move
the whole lot here !

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,846
Dad's working on it.

100
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,804
I wouldn't mind If he nicked
something worthwhile.

101
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,082
- That you, boys ?
- Yes, Mum.

102
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,682
- How did it all go, dear ?
- Oh, fina, Mum.

103
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,171
You could say it was a great day in the
history of British window cleaning.

104
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,648
Oh, that’s nice. Rosie could
hardly wait for you to get hack.

105
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,171
Oh, that’s nice too.

106
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,842
Yeah, she's been dreaming about
that chocolate fudge all day.

107
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,441
Oh, Sidney,
you didn't forget it ?

108
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,530
She told you she'd got a
craving for chocolate fudge.

109
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,051
Yeah, well, I know.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

110
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,571
Sidney !
Hera, love !

111
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,082
Eh ! And how's little
earth mother tonight, eh ?

112
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,328
I'm starving.
He forgot it.

113
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,761
You didn't.

114
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,089
Sorry, love, it slipped me mind. I'll go
after dinner. The nawngant stocks it.

115
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,285
One little thing. I ask you
to do one little thing

116
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,530
I'm sorry, Rosie, love. It’s not
the end of the world. I'll go now.

117
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,846
I don't want it now !

118
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,769
All right, I won't go
And got it now !

119
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,009
Rosie, all I want to do
is make you happy.

120
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,044
Than pie off.
Rosie

121
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,451
Yes, uh ... Well, I think I'll have a wash
before the thieving magpie gets home.

122
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,642
Timmy, I won't have you
talking Like that.

123
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,525
Your father never takes
anything that anyone wants.

124
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,960
Not even us.

125
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,728
It’s time I forked the potatoes.

126
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,525
Rosie, love, I said I was sorry, but with Timmy
and everything, I had a lot on my mind today.

127
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,961
Oh, I'll but And not
only on your mind.

128
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,286
Don't he Like that.

129
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,130
My friends get
around too, you know.

130
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,688
They saw a lot of your ladder,
but not so much of you.

131
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,645
Rosie, sometimes
I've got to he sociable.

132
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,047
You don't think I Like drinking
all them cups of tea, do you ?

133
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,164
It's part of holding up
the business, Rosie.

134
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,808
I'm doing it all for you, love.

135
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,601
Oh, all right. I'll forgive you.

136
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,961
That's a girl.

137
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,565
But watch it, because,
Sidney Noggett,

138
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,049
one extramarital
and I'll cut it off.

139
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,161
Don't answer it.

140
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,964
They've probably
come about the tally.

141
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,127
Isn't it working ?

142
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,687
Dad won't pay the instalments.
He can't got colour.

143
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,486
I keep telling him
It's a black-and-white set !

144
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,761
It is Dad.

145
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,769
So, what's the matter
with his key ?

146
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,644
He’s got his arms full.

147
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,970
Oh, God. More colourful crap.

148
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,569
Hera !

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,889
Harpoon it yourself,
did you ?

150
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,366
Ha, bloody ha.

151
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,405
Oh, God.

152
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,887
It was left on the Pullman Express.
Look nice over the fire, won't it ?

153
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,731
Look better on it.
Who asked for your opinion ?

154
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,570
Now, don't you two start.

155
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,969
Hang on ! I've got some rights here !
As a regular rant-payer"

156
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,162
Rent ? It don't even pay
our window cleaner.

157
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,807
Give over, Dad. Sid’s told you
why he doesn't do our windows.

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,721
Right. It’s had to bring your work home.
It only causes trouble.

159
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,447
You can't clean your own, Like a
psychiatrist never treats his own family

160
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,369
I don't interfere in your business,

161
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,562
so don't try to tell me
what to do with my moon.

162
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,520
Oh, come on, Dad.
I was only kidding.

163
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,688
I think he’s great.
Do you ?

164
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,962
Sure. We'll call him Clearance.

165
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,127
Clearance ?

166
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,202
Good evening, Clearance.
What do you think of Dad ?

167
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,489
- 'I think he’s a stupid old git.' You think
- he’s a stupid old git ? That's funny ...

168
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,650
Well, I still think you're nothing
but a no-good spongar.

169
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,570
Now, Your dad didn't mean it.
Say you're sorry, Dad.

170
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,161
All right. I'm sorry.

171
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,642
<i>He eh !
he’s sorry, Rush.</i>

172
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,171
It’s not him

173
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,724
- Well, I told I was sorry.
- It’s not you !

174
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,331
Well, what is it, dear ?

175
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,966
That bloody thing is leering at me !

176
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,882
Don't do that !
You'll break his antlers !

177
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,846
Yes, but what's this
'professional opinion' bit ?

178
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,804
You're not taking me
to the doctor, are you ?

179
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,242
Lil's not a doctor,
but she's certainly a specialist.

180
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,521
Who's Lil ?

181
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,281
My vary obliging second-removed
cousin, Lily Lamour.

182
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,450
The biggest sensation since natural gas.

183
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,409
I can't get it on right.

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,490
What's it like tonight ?

185
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,967
Four men and a dog. Ouch !

186
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,129
Hope nobody’s decent !
Evening, pussycats

187
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,800
Hello, darling.
How are you ?

188
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,561
Good show tonight, girls.
Hello, love, how are you ? Hi, Lil.

189
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,001
And to what do we owe
this royal visit ?

190
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,281
I need help, Lil.

191
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,164
What ? Have you
worn it out ?

192
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,771
No, not me.

193
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,486
This is for the family. I'd Like you
to meet my brother-in-law Timmy.

194
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,681
Please, Sid ...

195
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,847
HI, Timmy.
HI.

196
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,849
Baby dolls, please. Baby dolls.

197
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,121
So, what's
the problem ?

198
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,766
Well, there's been a slight gap
in Timmy’s education.

199
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,530
Yes, but I don't want
to fill it here.

200
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,051
You're not hunt,
are you ?

201
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,207
Of course I'm not bent.

202
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,767
Between you and me, he’s still
got a blue how tied to it !

203
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,610
Ha, ha, now ?
Please, Sid ...

204
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,167
Well, drink up
and talk Lil all about it.

205
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,762
Oh, Lil, Lil.
You're a doll.

206
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,166
And you're a bastard.

207
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,001
Sid, where are you going ?
Sid, where are you going ?

208
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,044
To get some chocolate fudge.

209
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,964
Relax, Timmy.
I won't bite. Relax !

210
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,525
I can't.
They'll be back in a minute.

211
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,370
Not as long as that music's playing.

212
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,923
Ooh !
is my hand cold ?

213
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,761
Uh, no, it was just that you ... Aahi

214
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,491
Well, hello.

215
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,521
You've left me.

216
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,529
Oh, I'm ... I'm sorry.

217
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,609
You got overexcited.

218
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,689
Yes, yes,
that’s what it was, yes.

219
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,565
We're not doing too well,
are we ?

220
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,285
No.

221
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,681
Would it help If I wore
the lion tamer’s gear ?

222
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,931
No. I don't know
what's come over me.

223
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,001
Well, it Isn't me.

224
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,365
Now, that’s better.

225
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,686
Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !

226
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,849
Ohh ... I

227
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,601
Oh, that was terrific.
That was absolutely terrific.

228
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,240
I'm glad, Timmy. But there's
something you ought to know.

229
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,601
Yes ?

230
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,280
I mean, I don't want you to go
through life with a fetish.

231
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,166
What do you mean ?

232
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,528
You've just had
my suspender beit.

233
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,002
[MI]

234
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,965
<i>Another night of mad,
passionate failure.</i>

235
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,049
<i>Eh that and the fetish bit.</i>

236
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,846
<i>I mean, Imagine having to say
to a bird, "Sorry, love,</i>

237
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,964
<i>I can only get it together If you wear
gum boots and a gas mask.</i>

238
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,366
<i>And also, would you mind terribly
If I had a feather up me ass ?</i>

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,086
<i>I never thought of myself as being unnatural.
Bloody unlucky, yes, but not unnatural.</i>

240
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,924
<i>"Timothy gets terribly confused
when it comes to sex."</i>

241
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,165
Here’s a list of today's jobs. I'm
starting you off with another chance.

242
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,441
Not with Lil ?

243
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,961
Huh ! You won't be saing Lil
again, not If she knows you first.

244
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,050
Mrs. Jacqueline Brown.
Oh, 47 Lyndhurst.

245
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,925
Right, Bluabaard.
She's a bit of a nympho.

246
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,045
And If you fall there, you may as well buy a
bacon slicer and join the Vienna Boys' Choir.

247
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,081
Come on, son, get it off.
Here, come on.

248
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,400
Sid.
Morning, Jacqul.

249
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,567
You're early.

250
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,569
Sorry, love. Had to
rearrange the schedule.

251
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,569
At least you'll get
done before the rain.

252
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,771
Oh, I'm breaking in
some new help.

253
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,405
Since when did you need help ?

254
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,364
Well, you know how things are.
You gotta expand.

255
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,766
And is this
the expansion ?

256
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,122
Yeah. My new mate Timmy.
Nice to meet you, Timmy.

257
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,482
Me too.
He hasn't had much experience yet.

258
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,411
But I'm sort of letting
him feel his way around

259
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,602
with a few understanding customers.

260
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,529
You were always thoughtful, Sid.

261
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,848
Yeah. Well, I'll leave
him to get on with it, then.

262
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,166
Won't I be saing you again ?

263
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,682
Oh, sure. I'll be in
and out, now and then.

264
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,406
Good job, now, Timmo.

265
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,761
- Right ?
- Right.

266
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,006
You won't be needing that inside.
The rooms are quite small.

267
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,884
Oh, yes, of course.
Sorry, madam.

268
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,565
Oh, it’s so humid today.
Aren't you hot ?

269
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,367
You, you are.
You're sweating.

270
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,365
Yes, I am a bit, yes.

271
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,884
How about a cold drink ?
Some tea or coffee ?

272
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,206
Oh, I'm easy.

273
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,689
I wouldn't have thought so.

274
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,766
Uh ... Well, a Coke
would he fine, yes.

275
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,528
One Coke coming up.

276
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,362
Yes, well, I think
I'd better get started.

277
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,971
What's the rush ?

278
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,130
Are you aiming to be the fastest
window cleaner in the West ?

279
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,481
No. I just thought ...

280
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,968
Look, just sit down
and have your drink first.

281
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,491
Oh, right.

282
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,524
I hope you're not in such
a hurry about everything.

283
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,730
I won't join you. I have
to watch my figure.

284
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,725
You must have
plenty of company.

285
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,048
Oh, I see
you're another Sid.

286
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,287
Oh, no, not quite.

287
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,244
- Are you married ?
- Oh, you're joking.

288
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,767
You ?

289
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,564
He’s abroad with the services.

290
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,841
Oh, what's be in ?

291
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,764
Anything that moves.

292
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,371
No, I'm being unkind. He’s in the
navy, so you can't blame him.

293
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,567
Or us.

294
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,122
Oh, God, quick, the window !
There's one over the sink.

295
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,287
Right.

296
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,046
Don't worry,
we'll soon clear up ... Oh !

297
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,928
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm
afraid I've made a man.

298
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,281
Already ?

299
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,801
No, you ass,
I've upset the ... Oh !

300
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,688
<i>Well, Jacqui had certainly
taught me how to come clean.</i>

301
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,487
<i>Now I know what they mean
by the ultimate detergent.</i>

302
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,607
<i>Talk about soft hands
and forever blowing bubbles !</i>

303
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,568
<i>Taught me something else too :
it's just like learning to ride a bike.</i>

304
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,684
<i>Once you find you can stay up,
there's no problem.</i>

305
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,126
<i>In fact, right there and then, I could fire
won the “Tour do France”, ladder and all.</i>

306
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,967
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

307
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,083
Hard at it ?
Yeah, on and off, yes.

308
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,964
You better pull over.
Oh, right.

309
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,527
Sorry, mate.

310
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,760
Oh, God.

311
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,089
What the bloody hall
do you think you're doing ?

312
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,406
Complete accident, sir.

313
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,965
Well, I shall want your name and address.

314
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,446
Fair enough, yes.

315
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,324
Uh, I clean them too.

316
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,170
Please, you must move
out of the road.

317
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,646
Oh, right.

318
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,127
Are you all right, sir ?
No thanks to him.

319
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,166
Sorry about that.

320
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,727
I'm afraid I shall have
to take a law particulars.

321
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,524
Fabulous.
Name ?

322
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,529
Timmy.
Timmy what ?

323
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,051
Lea. And yours ?

324
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,971
I mean, I can't go through life
calling you WPC 49, can I ?

325
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,561
Radlatt. Elizabeth Radlatt.
Address ?

326
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,171
Scruggs Lana, 63.

327
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,448
Uh ... will you come
to the movies tonight ?

328
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,131
Are you trying to bribe me ?

329
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,246
Yes.

330
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,768
Then I accept.

331
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,281
Yahoo !

332
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,765
<i>What a day !</i>

333
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,482
<i>With this kind of luck, I could even
sell return tickets to kamikaze pilots.</i>

334
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,845
<i>I could hardly wait for my next client,
Miss Prendergast.</i>

335
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,202
<i>A new customer,
so Sid said to take it easy.</i>

336
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,766
- Now ?
- Now.

337
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,244
Oh, thank you. It's the mattress
that makes it so heavy.

338
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,965
Be even heavier
If we were on it.

339
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,208
Now I can finish my
housework before I go out.

340
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,007
I'm afraid my daily’s
gone off with a hernia.

341
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,407
Ah, well, my auntie want off
with a Lithuanian.

342
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,128
Oh, no.
I've dropped my leather.

343
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,086
Do you know who you remind me of ?
Humphrey Bogart.

344
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,884
Oh, you're taking the mickey.

345
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,286
No, it’s your body.

346
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,686
You haven't seen my body.

347
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,689
I mean the way you walk.

348
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,090
You mean the way he held Lauren
Bacall in to Have and to Have Not ?

349
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,211
'If you want anything, whistle.'

350
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,363
You can fill your bucket in there.

351
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,281
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,523
You a movie fan, then ?
I see all the old stuff on the tally.

353
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,121
Well, I go as much as possible
when I'm not teaching.

354
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,606
Get away. What do you teach ?

355
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,767
Biology

356
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,724
Ooh ! Wish I was in your class.

357
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,208
You don't have to be gallant.
I wouldn't say it unless I meant it.

358
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,324
In fact, you remind me
a bit of Marilyn Monroe.

359
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,171
In these glasses ?
Now you're taking the mickey.

360
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,408
Ho, really. In that film
where she was short-sighted.

361
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,125
<i>How to Marry a Millionaire.
Yeah.</i>

362
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,047
I find you very attractive,
Miss Prandargast,

363
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,971
and I wanna kiss you.
Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate.

364
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,605
It was Mrs. Robinson.

365
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,571
So ?

366
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,563
I don't know how to put this. I mean,
I'm rather shy and I hardly know you.

367
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,808
Don't worry, love,
I'm way ahead of you.

368
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,241
Would you know If you can fix
the flush in the bathroom ?

369
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,681
The flush ?

370
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,928
I'd hate you to think
I was taking advantage,

371
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,441
but sometimes it works
and sometimes it doesn't.

372
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,689
- Oh ... Yeah.
- Thank you.

373
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,961
I'll have go.

374
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,447
Meanwhile, If you don't mind,
I'll go and get ready.

375
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,164
<i>Well, this was a puzzler
and no mistake.</i>

376
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,725
<i>Get ready for what ?</i>

377
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,127
<i>I'd feel such a bark
bursting in Markers,</i>

378
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,368
<i>only to find her
dressed to go shopping.</i>

379
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,001
<i>I was getting confused again.</i>

380
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,808
<i>Birds unfunny things, you know.</i>

381
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,404
<i>One minute they give you the "No, no, you mustn't" bit.
Then suddenly it's "Yes, you must, you randy bugger. "</i>

382
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,406
Should be all right now.
I, uh ...

383
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,850
Uh ... Had to adjust
the ballcock.

384
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,809
I wish I was clever with my hands.

385
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,969
But you could be If you tried.

386
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,888
No, no, you mustn't.
It’s wicked.

387
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,969
Oh, that’s not what Lauren Bacall said.

388
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,682
I want to kiss these beautiful breasts.

389
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,444
<i>That's Clark Gable in Rod Dust.
He never need that.</i>

390
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,242
Because Jean Harlow’s weren't
as beautiful as yours.

391
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,049
You can't stay long, you know.
Her father comes home for lunch.

392
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,766
Then the quicker we reach
the Alamo, the better !

393
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,405
John Wayne.

394
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,728
<i>True Grit.</i>

395
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,764
He’s getting naughty now.

396
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,483
Naughty and Impatient.

397
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,884
What's ?
Oh !

398
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,527
Scissors. Scissors.
Have you got any scissors ?

399
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,970
It’s all right. I've done it.

400
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,491
Oh, good.

401
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,764
Right,
let’s take it off.

402
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,689
No, she doesn't want to.
She's shy.

403
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,604
Under here. It’s Nicer.
Oh. Right.

404
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,768
No, no, he’s got to say
hello to her first.

405
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,246
Oh.

406
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,962
Hello. Hello.

407
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,527
Oh, yes, oh,
she Likes that.

408
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,324
Is he enjoying it too ?

409
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,808
Mmm. Talk to her.
Talk to her.

410
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,247
He need
he can't Wait any longer.

411
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,965
Carola ?

412
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,370
You upstairs ?

413
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,449
Just finishing the carpet.
Be right with you.

414
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,210
I'll come and help.

415
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,401
Where are my knickers ?

416
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,204
Sod your knickers.
Stop him coming up.

417
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,641
My leather ?

418
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,965
Hello. They let me off early. Oh.

419
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,884
- Morning.
- Morning.

420
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,610
Well, that’s it, then. Don't worry about
the payment. We'll and an account.

421
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,961
Thank you.

422
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,648
Extraordinary way to clean windows.

423
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,365
Oh, he'll come hack
and do the rut later.

424
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,324
No, I mean he was cleaning
them with knickers.

425
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,487
Knickers ?

426
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,291
How's that ?

427
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,447
Bloody marvellous.

428
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,440
Bloody horrible. I just hope it
doesn't affect the baby, that's all.

429
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,166
Evening, all.

430
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,643
There ! I didn't forget
this time, did I ?

431
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,970
Oh, you are good to me.
But I need pineapple.

432
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,321
Pineapple ?

433
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,522
Never mind.
It’s the thought that counts.

434
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,404
Rosie, you distinctly said ...

435
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,568
It's not in the centre.
Yes, it is.

436
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,801
Oh, God.

437
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,010
You know what you can do, don't you ?

438
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,247
Sid, can I ask a favour ?

439
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,283
It depends.
Here, how did it go today ?

440
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,130
Oh, you would have been
proud of me, Sid.

441
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,889
- Can I borrow the minivan tonight ?
- What for ?

442
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,890
- I've got a very special date.
- Not with one of my customers ?

443
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,206
Of course not.

444
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,890
Because that would be highly unethical.

445
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,443
Are window cleaners struck off ?

446
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,926
You ass,
she's off duty tonight and ...

447
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,646
Hang on. Off duty ? You
mean Fanny the Fuzz ?

448
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,250
Her name is Elizabeth.

449
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,408
I don't care if it’s Sherlock Holmes.

450
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,170
You can't bring her back here.

451
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,966
- Why not ? She's a nice girl.
- Nice girl ?! She's a copper !

452
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,605
Thus do I see why I can't bring her back.

453
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,690
Because most of this let's
probably on her list, that’s why.

454
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,564
Now what are we fighting about ?

455
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,205
Timmy’s got himself involved with the law.

456
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,528
- Timmy, what have you done ?
- Nothing, Mum.

457
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,405
Just because I've got a date with a
girl that happens to be a policewoman.

458
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,762
Policewoman ? Oh ...

459
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,770
She's a smashing bird, Mum.
Intelligent, well-spoken.

460
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,531
Oh, yeah. She's passed all
her cross-examinations.

461
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,007
You can all relax,
because I'm not bringing her back.

462
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,727
Oh, I think that’s wise, dear.
We don't want to refurnish.

463
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,163
Oh, and I won't be in for grub.
All right.

464
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,969
Take your bucket, then.
It shouldn't be in here.

465
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,650
Hello, what's this ?

466
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,487
Well, from memory, I'd say
they were a pair of knickers.

467
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,047
- They're for his collection.
- Collection ?

468
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,891
Didn't you know your son's the demon
knicker nicker of Scruggs Lane ?

469
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,570
Why don't you halt up.

470
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,444
It’s not true.
Timmy ?

471
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,608
Of course it’s not.
He’s having you on.

472
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,963
All right, it' you're all so
Interested, uh ... I bought them.

473
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,571
You bought knickers ?

474
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,205
He’s dead kinky too.

475
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,686
Disgusting.
Go on.

476
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,121
Drop your trousers. Show
them what you're wearing.

477
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,765
I bought them for a girlfriend.

478
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,962
Is it a crime to he found
with a pair of knickers ?

479
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,650
Not If you're a window cleaner.

480
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,124
And what is that supposed to mean ?

481
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,321
Well, If the cap fits ...

482
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,681
Quick, ambulance !
It's coming !

483
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,366
Wind.

484
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,324
Oh, sorry, I was trying
to look for the, um ...

485
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,209
Oh ! Timmyl

486
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,402
Sorry, just dropped a bit of popcorn.

487
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,965
You won't find it up there.

488
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,525
Behave yourself.

489
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,688
I'm gonna have to put you in handcuffs.

490
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,931
I don't know.
You can't win, can you ?

491
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,444
You make s pass, it's wrong. You don't
make s pass, you've insulted them.

492
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,607
Who’s him ?

493
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,242
You wouldn't Like to think
I didn't fancy you, would you ?

494
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,684
No, I'm glad you do. It’s just that
there's a proper time and a proper place.

495
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,121
Yeah, but what happens when you've got
the time but can't afford the place ?

496
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,446
Oh, Timmy.

497
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,086
It’s not a question of money. It’s
just getting to know each other.

498
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,971
That's what I was trying to do.

499
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,207
You're sweet.
But you're impossible.

500
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,768
That's what Sid says.
Impossible, I mean.

501
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,962
And you're too good for that sort of job.

502
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,571
What's wrong with cleaning windows ?

503
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,681
Nothing, but you should be doing
something a little more ...

504
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,245
A little more rewarding.

505
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,566
Such as ?

506
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,166
Well, you'd, uh, make a good policeman.

507
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,684
It' you thought about it seriously.

508
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,771
What's so funny ?

509
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,884
The family. If I told them I was gonna
be a copper, they'd go berserk !

510
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,411
What's wrong with being a copper ?

511
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,965
Nothing. It’s all right for some, I suppose.

512
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,685
If you're the officious type.

513
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,405
Oh, well, thanks a lot.

514
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,970
Oh, I didn't ... I didn't mean you.

515
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,162
I think it’s time I want home now, anyway.

516
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,807
Liz, Liz

517
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,729
You don't have to drive me.
I can get a cab.

518
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,729
Of course I'll drive you.

519
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,887
Liz, Liz

520
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,287
Excuse me, sir.
£1, please.

521
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,086
Oh, yes.
Liz, Wait a minute

522
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,646
Excuse me, sir.
Pick it up, please.

523
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,091
Without service.

524
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,241
Thank you.

525
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,648
I've enjoyed it, Timmy.
Really, I have.

526
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,127
Trust me to put my big flat foot in it.

527
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,369
Oh, I didn't mean your kind ...

528
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,891
I know what you meant.

529
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,768
Like to come in for a good-nighter ?

530
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,769
Would I ? Oh, yes !

531
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,969
How many of you live here ?
Just me and my parents.

532
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,005
Early-to-bedders, eh ?

533
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,725
No, they're out at one of Daddy's dinners.

534
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,763
What does your, uh,
dad do, then ?

535
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,041
He’s an Inspector.

536
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,083
- Income tax ?
- Police.

537
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,725
He’s not that frightening.

538
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,922
Well, won't he mind me being here, then ?

539
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,203
Why should be ? Any more than
your parents would object to me.

540
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,326
So you see, Timmy, If ever you did decide
to change jobs, I might be able to help.

541
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,969
Timmy,
I'm talking to you.

542
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,127
Liz.

543
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,611
Handcuffs.

544
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,847
I'm extremely glad to be hack.
Oh, it wasn't so bad, dear.

545
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,965
It’s all right.
Don't panic.

546
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,841
- Are you in, Elizabeth ?
- Yes, Mummy.

547
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,048
Oh, I didn't know you had company.

548
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,605
Mummy, this is Timmy.

549
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,246
Oh, how nice.
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Radlett.

550
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,805
How long has that van been outside ?

551
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,206
Oh, it’s mine, sir.

552
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,561
- Oh, is it ?
- Yes, sir.

553
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,967
Well, the tyres are worn.
It really shouldn't be on the road at all.

554
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,161
I'm sorry, sir.

555
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,368
- Have you been in a fight ?
- No, sir.

556
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,925
Why’s your mouth bleeding ?

557
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,161
How was the dinner, Daddy ?

558
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,850
Absolutely dreadful.

559
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,930
The chief constable has got verbal diarrhoea.
I need a brandy.

560
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,565
How about Mr ... ?

561
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,888
No, thanks.
I have to be going.

562
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,525
Timmy just dropped me
home from the movies.

563
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,801
How Nice.

564
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,208
I take it you're conversant
with the tyre test.

565
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,527
Tyre test ?

566
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,963
Yes. You, uh, put a coin in the tread.

567
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,969
And if it falls out,
the tyre’s illegal.

568
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,605
Oh, I'll do that, sir.

569
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,531
Good. And I should put some Dettol
on your mouth If I were you.

570
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,451
Oh, yes, I'll do that too, sir.
Good night, ma'am.

571
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,970
Oh, yes, well,
good night.

572
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,926
So Nice.

573
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,764
- He's lying, of course.
- Lying ?

574
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,200
Oh, yes.

575
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,210
You can't got all that blood round your
mouth unless you've been in a fight.

576
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,248
It wasn't blood, John.
It was lipstick.

577
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,649
Lipstick ? Oh, Christ,
is he one of those ?

578
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,568
I take it you're also conversant
with the cost of four bloody tyros.

579
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,809
Only you could screw your
way into a fuzz nut !

580
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,048
How was I to know
about her old man ?

581
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,847
You better pull your finger out and get
some new clients to pay for this lot !

582
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,171
And I don't mean Scotland
Yard, the Old Bailey or Hi5 !

583
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,165
<i>What Sid didn't know was the only thing I'd
screwed out of Elizabeth was another date.</i>

584
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,287
<i>As for the job, welt, it was a relief to find that some
people only expected the window cleaner to clean windows.</i>

585
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,730
<i>Although there was never
a dull moment,</i>

586
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,485
and mostly it was a good,
healthy outdoor life

587
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,762
there were times I fell
the job was gelling on top of me.

588
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,490
One marshmallow for you,
for being a good boy,

589
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,604
and one for me,
for being a good customer.

590
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,846
What's the matter ?

591
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,610
Nothing. Circulation
will come back.

592
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,647
But I have been a good customer,
though, haven't I, Tim ?

593
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,889
I mean, who also gives you
a two-year contract ?

594
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,686
No one.
Well, then, act grateful.

595
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,645
I did.
That was 10 minute ago !

596
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,926
Oh ! Wait, I've got
to finish this first.

597
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,804
Oh, excuses, excuses.

598
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,049
- You sound like my late husband.
- Didn't know he was dead.

599
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,322
Well, he is.
From the waist down.

600
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,122
Wait, Wait. He won't
suddenly hurty in, will he ?

601
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,924
Oh, not until the batting shop closes.

602
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,804
Then all he'll want is
more money, the bastard.

603
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,607
Not there !
Brenda ?

604
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,165
Go away !
I'm resting.

605
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,489
It’s Important, Brenda !

606
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,001
Not there ! The rug.

607
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,531
The rug ?

608
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,046
Look, you're wasting your time.
I don't have any money.

609
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,289
Oh, with you looking like that,
Brenda, who needs money ?

610
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,611
Oh, you ? And what do
you think you're going to do ?

611
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,404
You, Brenda, you.

612
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,207
Well, you've got another think coming.
And get off me marshmallows.

613
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,528
Oh, now, Brenda, you know
how I feel about you.

614
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,968
Oh, yes, with your clammy hands.

615
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,925
Look, I'm warning you !
Oh, come on, Bran.

616
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,168
Right ! You asked for this.

617
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,330
How would you like to meet my husband ?

618
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,725
Well ... What ...

619
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,524
All right. You can come out now.

620
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,401
Come out ?

621
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,805
He hasn't gone for a gun, has he ?

622
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,165
Brenda,
for God's sake !

623
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,886
You thought that he was my husband !

624
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,923
What ?
And he thought that you were.

625
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,964
- You mean he wasn't your husband ?
- He was the landlord.

626
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,730
That's the way he likes his rant.

627
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,084
You wicked cowl

628
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,131
<i>Sid had warned me about
the next call, Villiers House.</i>

629
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,970
<i>"Hygiene-mad, he said." Wipe
your feet, newspapers on the carpet.</i>

630
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,606
<i>And you even have to wash your
hands before you touch the soap !</i>

631
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,366
<i>In fact, Sid said, "Better be safe. Don't touch
anything, and certainly not Mrs. Villiers.</i>

632
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,086
<i>Because her old man owned
this block of ﬂats we serviced.</i>

633
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,043
Hello. Uh, window cleaner.

634
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,447
Please ?
Uh, windows.

635
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,007
Ah, Mrs. Villiers instruct me
to let you do it.

636
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,491
Did she, now ?

637
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,322
You start up or down, please ?
Oh, that’s up to Mrs. Villiers.

638
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,249
Oh, is no matter.
She isn't home.

639
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,121
Oh. Well, I think I'd like to start
at the top and work my way down.

640
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,765
Top. Okay.

641
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,970
Cor !

642
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,122
This is top.
No shoes here.

643
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,767
You're kidding.
No. It is so there is no dirt for feet.

644
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,645
And Mrs. Villiers say
to use newspapers.

645
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,410
She sounds like a right king to me.

646
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,009
Here, what about that mirror ?

647
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,521
Ah. Mrs. Villiers likes to see everything.

648
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,371
Oh, you mean it’s a two-way ?
Please ?

649
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,763
A two-way mirror. You know, one way you
look in, the other way you look out ?

650
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,610
Oh, I am sorry.
My english.

651
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,401
Ah. Well, say you and
me were having it ...

652
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,640
Better not say that.

653
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,283
<i>Suppose you was
Mug and ...</i>

654
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,971
I'll start the windows.

655
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,367
Okay.
Eh ... A moment.

656
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,931
- Is good ?
- Oh, vary good.

657
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,408
Good. Also, she say to cover hooks.

658
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,045
I should've worn gloves for this job.

659
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,527
Mrs. Villiers like everything very clean.

660
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,167
Hey, she is kinky. Look at this.
Body Discipline.

661
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,486
It’s whips and things,
Isn't it ?

662
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,570
No, is yoga.
She is big yoga-doer.

663
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,081
Naked Yoga.
Naked yoga !

664
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,964
Is better with free body.

665
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,969
You mean you do this ?
Of course.

666
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,650
'The toe-hold lotus posture.'
She must be on hinges to do that.

667
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,686
After practice, is not difficult.
You sit, I show.

668
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,481
Oh, sit.

669
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,891
<i>you do so.</i>

670
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,605
So.
Come.

671
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,131
Me ?

672
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,727
Now so.

673
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,287
And so.

674
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,161
You try again.

675
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,169
Try again ? I can't move.

676
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,691
I got rigor mortise.

677
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,008
That's because you are
not yet circulating.

678
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,964
Look, I think I should go
and circulate these windows.

679
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,889
Ah, but first, we must uncramp you.

680
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,367
Mrs. Villiers wlll not Like
If you fall off ladder.

681
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,244
Yeah, well, the Idea doesn't
grab me much either.

682
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,283
So ...

683
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,202
This is for
circulating your head.

684
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,845
You're having me on !

685
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,531
Even you can't do that.

686
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,802
Without clothes, of course.
Oh !

687
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,205
So is good.
is releasing all tension.

688
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,484
You speak for yourself.

689
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,162
Makes blood to the head.
It’s the beet cure. Come on.

690
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,761
Watch it ! I had a little
bit of zip trouble yesterday.

691
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,291
Okay. You do it.

692
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,529
Right. Don't blame me If this
gets bigger than both of us.

693
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,969
Maybe this is euler for you.

694
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,368
Uh, couldn't we just lie
on the bed and meditate ?

695
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,210
The bed !
is good idea.

696
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,724
Like so. And I hold your legs up. Oh, come.
You're spoilt by clothes.

697
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,966
Yes, well, I'd rather be spoilt
than do myself an injury.

698
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,286
Right.

699
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,010
Hope I'm not sick on her carpet.

700
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,168
Very quiet. Balance.

701
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,884
Concentrate.
I am !

702
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,962
I count three and I let go.
One, two ...

703
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,571
How dare you ?

704
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,171
OW ! Oh ...

705
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,763
- Um, I was just ...
- Get off my bed at once !

706
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,601
- And you, get out.
- Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am, I was ...

707
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,765
She was only relieving my tensions.

708
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,088
- Out !
- Out. Yeah.

709
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,288
- I'll speak to you later, Ingrid.
- Yes, madam.

710
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,802
- I forgot me ladder.
- I said, get out.

711
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,001
But my ladder ...

712
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,089
You don't get out of this house,
I shall call the police.

713
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,487
- Out of this house.
- Yes, ma'am.

714
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,364
And put a clean cover
on my bed Immediately.

715
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,846
Immediately !

716
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,961
You come back here, no ladder,
no bucket, no shoes and socks,

717
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,128
and you tell me
It’s because you've got cramp ?

718
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,529
What are you, some sort
of congenial idiot or something ?

719
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,165
It was this naked yoga, Sid.

720
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,331
You realise old man Villiers will probably
cancel our whole office contract.

721
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,965
I'm sure
If you apologised ...

722
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,447
Me ?! Was I standing on my
head half-knackars naked ?!

723
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,091
I was wearing my shorts !

724
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,124
I don't care if you was wearing a frog suit

725
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,604
No, I meant apologise for me, Sid.

726
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,606
I mean, when it comes to charm chat,
no one’s more experienced than you.

727
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,441
Well, I suppose, if you look at it
that way. Right.

728
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,890
I need my bloody head examined.
Come on.

729
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,811
Oh, could we stop off
and get me some shoes first ?

730
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,927
Oh, no.

731
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,968
What are you standing there for ?
Come on !

732
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,564
Ah, Mrs. Villiers.

733
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,651
I've come round here in person to
apologise for the inexcusable behavior ...

734
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,921
of my young brothar-in-law here.

735
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,802
Basically, he’s a good boy.
Honest, kind to animals.

736
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,244
And his parents. But emotionally,
he’s a shade retarded.

737
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,048
However, I feel sure that
someone of your warmth,

738
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,450
your intuitive grasp of the situation ...

739
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,880
facing young People today,

740
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,845
will have no difficulty in deciding ...

741
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,443
that this was just a childish escapade.

742
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,322
- Have you finished, Mr. Noggett ?
- I have indeed, Mrs. Villiers.

743
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,010
And what have you got to say ?

744
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,531
Oh, I agree.

745
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,970
Oh, I mean,
I'll do anything to make up for it.

746
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,447
Then the incident is closed. And
you may proceed with the windows.

747
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,322
- Thank you, Mr. Noggett.
- Thank you, Mrs. Villiers.

748
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,290
Leave these things out there. You can come
In and fix up a light bulb for me first.

749
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,130
A light bulb ?
Oh, yes, of course.

750
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,164
And wipe your feat.
Then come into the house.

751
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,129
There's a broken one
down in the cellar.

752
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,287
Right.

753
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,162
Oh, it’s the coal cellar.

754
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,964
The light’s up there
on the left-hand wall.

755
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,762
Ah. I need something
to stand on.

756
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,249
Must say, I never thought
of you in a coal cellar.

757
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,651
And how did you think of me ?

758
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,524
Well, you like everything
so clean, don't you ?

759
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,687
Oh, ta.

760
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,169
<i>You have a firm young body.</i>

761
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,683
Oh, no. The ... The top’s
come off. Look.

762
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,726
Oh, I'm ... I'm sorry.
It sort of came off in my hand.

763
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,084
You're just a dirty little boy,
aren't you ?

764
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,524
Don't worry.
It’s only coal.

765
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,009
Look. Here.
Let me put it on for you.

766
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,441
Stay where you are.
You're filthy.

767
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,445
Oh, it'll seems off ?

768
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,328
You're not going to walk
through my house Like that.

769
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,090
Oh, of course not.
I'll take my shoes off.

770
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,611
- You'll take your clothes off.
- Pardon ?

771
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,482
Every stitch. Off.

772
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,327
Then we'll give you a bath.

773
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,965
Oh, now, Wait a minute.
All I need is a tap.

774
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,286
There must be one In the garden.

775
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,891
I hope you're not going
to cause more trouble.

776
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,047
No, of course not.

777
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,049
All I'm saying is, if we put
newspapers on the carpet ...

778
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,730
Ara you refusing to take a bath ?

779
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,206
Yes ! I ... No.

780
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,925
I'll take one when I get home.

781
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,242
Very well. If you're going
to behave Like a child ...

782
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,200
We'll just have to treat you Like one.

783
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,210
Eh ... What are you doing ?
I'm undressing you.

784
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,965
No, you're not.
Get off !

785
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,762
I bring thee presents from the
mystical shores of a distant land.

786
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,008
Are you smashed again ?
Oh, Rosie

787
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,680
That's not nice, when he’s
remembered your pineapple.

788
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,848
Thanks, Mum.
Timmy back yet ?

789
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,566
He’s up having a bath.
Give you a kiss, then.

790
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,286
That's better, eh ?
Come on.

791
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,971
Mmm, you small good.
What is it ?

792
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,811
'From the
mystical shores of a distant land.'

793
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,764
- What's all this, then ?
- All what ?

794
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,689
The gear.
We’re going to a party or something ?

795
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,043
Ho, it's just Nice
to dress up now and then.

796
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,480
Wait a minute.

797
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,008
- What day is it ?
- Wednesday. Why ?

798
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,809
- He’s been, then, has he ?
- Who, dear ?

799
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,528
The window cleaner, that's who ! So
that's why you're all puffed up, is it ?

800
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,007
I don't know what you're on about.

801
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,761
There's nothing wrong with
window cleaners. You keep telling me.

802
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,602
All rightl All right. But I know that
randy bastard that does this street !

803
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,201
Really, Sidney.
If you're inferring ...

804
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,811
Oh. That'll be Dad
with another armful.

805
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,561
It’s not Dad. It’s the law.
Oh, my God. Now what ?

806
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,687
Ho, relax. It's only
Timmy’s bluebird.

807
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,644
Hello. Uh, sorry
you had to Wait.

808
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,888
Sorry to call unannounced.

809
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,366
He’s having a bath.

810
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,289
I can't ask you in. The place
has just been fumigated.

811
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,006
- Fumigatad ?
- Yeah. Had a plague of flying ants.

812
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,646
Oh, how awful.
Can I Give him a message ?

813
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,446
We had a data tonight, but as you
can know, I had to go on duty.

814
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,210
Okay, I'll tell him.
I'll know him tomorrow.

815
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,401
Lucky old him.

816
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,765
You don't remember me, do you ?
I used to clean your school windows.

817
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,171
As a matter of fact, I do remember,
but I didn't think you did.

818
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,728
Well, I didn't till just now.
It’s the way you need 'How awful.'

819
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,968
How awful. Oh ... I haven't changed
much since school, have I ?

820
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,209
Oh, I don't know.
Well, good luck with the flying ants.

821
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,446
- Timmo ?
- What ?

822
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,721
- Got a message for you.

824
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,564
Have you ever been interfered
with in a coal cellar ?

825
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,683
- Interfered with ?
- Mrs. Villiers.

826
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,004
I don't think it’s funny.

827
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,804
I'm sorry ...

828
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,484
What's the message ?

832
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,688
Bloody fool ! Why don't
you look whore you're going ?

833
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,281
I'm terribly sorry.
I was just ...

834
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,162
Never mind about that.
Come out of the way.

835
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,488
I'm glad I found you.
I don't think he was.

836
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,925
Sid gave me your message. Tomorrow's fine.
Where shall we go ?

837
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,088
- Do you like spaghetti ?
- Yeah.

838
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,327
I'll cook you some.

839
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,246
What, at your place ?

840
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,169
The family's dining out in the country.

841
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,646
Oh, Liz !

842
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,763
Timmy
I'm on duty.

843
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,964
I don't care, Liz. I just don't care.
I've just got to kiss you.

844
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,128
Timmy,

845
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,690
<i>Message to all units.

succumbing to my irresistible magnetism.</i>

852
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,204
<i>I mean, faced with my suave, debonair
charm, what chance did she stand ?</i>

853
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,247
Who is it ?

854
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,446
Oh, it’s Noggett’s Window
Cleaning. Good morning.

855
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,524
Hello, I'm sorry, it’s me again.
Uh, will I need my ladder ?

856
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,721
No.

857
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,921
Oh, ta.

858
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,241
Hello, me again. Could you press
the knob for me again ?

859
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,805
No, it’s not Sid. I'm
Timmy, his brother-in-law.

860
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,765
Better Identify myself.
Can't be too careful his days, can you ?

861
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,323
Uh, where can I get
my water ? Oh, right.

862
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,640
Cosy little pad you've got here.

863
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,769
Oh, God ! Sorry about that.
I'll get another one.

864
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,890
Uh ... Look me ...

865
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,406
I know it's none of my business,
but If there's anything I can do ...

866
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,045
Don't touch me !

867
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,169
Okay. I just thought I might help.

868
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,407
How could you help ?

869
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,770
Well, I don't know
what it is, do I ?

870
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,525
Have you ever been In love ?

871
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,923
Is that all ? I thought
it was something serious.

872
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,283
Serious ? I've given four
years of my life to Ronnie.

873
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,371
I've made a home, cooked, cleaned, scrubbed.
And all for what ?

874
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,882
So some bleached hitch ...
Of course it’s serious.

875
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,962
I ... I wouldn't get in an uproar, girl.
I mean, these things happen.

876
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,525
Ronnie's a bastard.

877
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,200
Yeah, well, it’s probably a touch
of the old four-year itch.

878
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,243
He needs shaking up,
a hit of his own madicine.

879
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,567
What do you mean ?

880
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,649
Well, Ronnie's made
you jealous, right ?

881
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,683
You return the compliment.

882
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,291
Do you really think it would work ?

883
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,721
It’s worth a try.
Nothing to lose, have you ?

884
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,646
It’s Ronnie.
I'd better get on with the windows.

885
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,610
I'm going to take your advice.

886
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,847
Good for you.

887
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,403
Hey, that’s terrific.
It’s a bed.

888
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,321
Get in it.

889
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,247
Pardon ?

890
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,371
I thought you offered to help me.

891
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,325
Ya ... Yes, I did.

892
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,090
Ron won't like it if I'm in bed with you.

893
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,520
It’s your ideal

894
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,887
Oh, God !

895
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,889
Come on, quickly, get undressed !

896
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,320
Yes, yes, all right.

897
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,120
Cor ! Yes.

There we go.

899

Ooh ! What's the matt ... ?
Ow What's the matter ?

900
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,171
We're only simulating.

901
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,648
Oh. Oh, sorry, miss.
Sorry.

902
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,529
Elvie

903
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,325
Oh, hello, Ronnie.

Elvie, Elvie. how could you do this to me ?
And with a man !

905
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,449

Get out ! You male chauvinist pig

906
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,007
Look, I can explain everything !

907
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,291
Uh, hello, Mum ? Look, I've,
run into a slight problem.

908
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,324
Do you know
where I can find Sid ?

909
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,170
What's he doing in hospital ?

910
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,125
Hello, Smiler.

911
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:04,884
Hello, Smiler. Listen to him. Hey,
how long before he can say Dada ?

912
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,163
We've dacided not to tell him who
you are until he’s stronger.

913
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,885
Full of wit today, aren't we, eh ?
He’s got my eyes, you know.

914
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,765
As long as it’s only your
eyes, he’s all right.

915
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,928
Who's a beautiful
little diddums ?

916
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,804
Eh, diddums ?

917
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,526
Oh, sorry.

918
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,050
Hello, Rosie, congratulations.
You too, Sid.

919
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,083
<i>Nine pounds, ten ounces.
mu !</i>

920
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,169
It’s Nice of you to come, Timmy.

921
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,407
I bought them for you.

922
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,046
Oh, look, Sidney.
Weren't they lovely ?

923
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,208
Here, what's the matter with your eye ?

924
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,927
Oh, nothing.
Uh, hanged it on a wall.

925
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,361
Give them to the nurse, Sidney.
She'll put them in water.

926
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,641
She'll have to put them
In splints.

927
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,487
Isn't he great ?
Looks just Like Sid.

928
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,205
I hope not.
That's not our baby.

929
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,251
Well, back to the old treadmill, love.

930
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,968
Timmo can Wait for a while.
Mum's coming in after lunch.

931
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,083
I'll see you later, then. Sober.

932
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,930
Oh, she's full
of quips today, eh ?

933
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,125
Hey, and for God's sake, don't let him hold the baby.
It’s odds-on, he'll drop him.

934
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,486
Ta-ra, Noggett Junior. Ta-ra.
Ta-ra, love.

935
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,969
Isn't he fantastic ?

936
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,207
I mean, I just thought of you
as a great big lump.

937
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,165
Oh, charming.
No, no ...

938
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,967
Ho, what I meant is that I never
thought about the baby being inside.

939
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,921
It’s amazing.

940
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,490
Wait until you have
one of your own.

941
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,410
Yeah. I might, mightn't I ?

942
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,523
Oh ! That was fantastic.

943
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,563
More ?
Oh, you're joking.

944
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,966
I feel like Rosie did.

945
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,283
Well, so long as it’s
only the spaghetti.

946
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,448
We don't want you
making medical history.

947
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,447
- Do you know something, Liz ?
- What ?

948
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,961
I think you're the most
smashing bird I've ever met.

949
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,528
I don't exactly find you
repulsive either.

950
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,088
When you're not trying
to emulate Sid.

951
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,169
Oh, Sid’s all right
once you get to know him.

952
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,283
- I do know him.
- What ?

953
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,609
- Met him when I was at school.
- You never told me.

954
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,245
I didn't think it was that important.

955
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,167
- Did you ... ?
- No, I didn't.

956
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,840
- You fancied him ?
- I want out with him once.

957
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,808
He lost, three falls out of three.

958
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,369
You don't know
how glad I am, Liz.

959
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,768
- Do you Like television ?
- Television ?

960
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,440
There's a great Charlie
Snowgardan concert on.

961
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,081
Oh, that’s nice.

962
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,331
Unfortunately, the at down hero's broken.
Do you mind going upstairs ?

963
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,287
Upstairs ?

964
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,960
You. My mum and dad have got a
at the bottom of thair bed.

965
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,288
Charlie Snow ... Charlie Snowgardan ?
That's terrific

966
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,289
Only If you like his music, though.

967
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,482
Love it. Especially when
It's upstairs.

968
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,571
- No !
- Why not ?

969
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,569
Because I can't concentrate.

970
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,131
Hello ? Oh, hello, Mummy.
No, I was just watching the tally.

971
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,122
Yes ? Oh, poor you.

972
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,005
So that means you'll be
staying the night, then ?

973
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,651
Of course. It’s not the first
time I've been alone, is it ? Okay.

974
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,001
You too.

975
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,168
Their car's broken down.

976
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,291
That's too bad.
Now, Timmy, that doesn't mean ...

977
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,642
Oh, Liz, I want you more than ever.

978
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,800
Oh, I know, Timmy. And it was wrong
of me to let you go this far.

979
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,240
But why, Liz ?

980
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,370
Because I don't want to
he just another easy lay.

981
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,040
But you're not
an easy lay. I mean ...

982
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,924
I don't want to sound
old-fashioned, Timmy,

983
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,489
but I have to he able
to live with myself.

984
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,362
I want to feel that when
I finally get married ...

985
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,483
Well, why don't we.

986
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,806
Timmy,
is that a proposal ?

987
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,890
Yes. I suppose it is.

988
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,409
Hey, we're in their bed.

989
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,841
That's all right. We'll make it
before they get back.

990
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,767
Yeah. Yeah.
We'd better.

991
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,647
Slowly, Timmy. Slowly.
It’s not a race.

992
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,645
Oh, right, yes.

993
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,331
What's the matter ?

994
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,807
Um ... Nothing.
Nothing.

995
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,489
I thought you wanted me.

996
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,921
I do. I do, I do.

997
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,360
Timmy ?

998
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,769
I'll be all right in a minute.
I must wanted you too much.

999
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,971
Don't worry. We've got a
lifetime ahead of us.

1000
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,562
They're coming back
In the morning.

1001
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,524
I mean when
we're married, silly.

1002
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,407
Married ?

1003
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,601
To a copper ?

1004
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,881
When did this happen ?

1005
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,450
A few days ago. I didn't know
how you'd all take it.

1006
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,008
Never mind how we're gonna take it. How is
she gonna take it, living in your attic ?

1007
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,363
That’s another thing. we find a flat,
her old man says we can stay there.

1008
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,324
What, in the police station ?

1009
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,046
No, in their house.

1010
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,283
To think I'm going to close
To my little baby boy.

1011
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,051
Oh, turn it up, Mum !
He’s not going to war.

1012
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,844
No, but it’s
the next but think.

1013
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,008
Well, thank you and
goodbye, Sidney Noggett.

1014
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:53,171
Oh, come on. I was only kidding. It's a good idea.
Give him a sense of responsibility.

1015
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,964
I think every man
should have a wife.

1016
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,969
Preferably his own.

1017
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,968
Is it going to be
a church wedding ?

1018
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,130
Yeah. But it’s all right. They're
taking care of everything.

1019
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,561
Can't Wait to see Dad
In a grey topper.

1020
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,163
Hey, you're right. I shall have
to watch out for one of them.

1021
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,007
Come on, for God's sake !

1022
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,160
It’s like trying to get a hunch
of performing seals on the road !

1023
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,566
I can't find my gloves.

1024
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,411
What do you want gloves for ? He’s
being married, not knighted. Mum !

1025
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,846
I think I'm going to cry.

1026
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,841
So am I it' I don't get you lot out
In that Rolls. Come on, love.

1027
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,568
Stop crying. You'll lose your eyelashes.
Just get in there and relax, girl

1028
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,169
Now, where the hell
is Dad ? Dad ?

1029
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,011
Here. Not a bad fit, is it ?

1030
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,602
<i>Christ, you look like the cover of Butch Male.
Get in the car. Go on.</i>

1031
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,445
- Walt. I've gotta get me hat.
- Timmy ?

1032
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,849
I'm in the carousel
Hey, I'd better do that as well.

1033
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,007
Oh, God.

1034
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,448
I'm sure
I've forgotten something.

1035
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,803
You've got everything but the bleeding wand.
Get in the car !

1036
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,571
Sidney, you're so uncouth.
Oh, go on.

1037
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,606
Oh, Did.

1038
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,003
Here, a quick one for the road.

1039
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,487
Oh, ta, Dad.
I'll get my tooth mug.

1040
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,484
I've got butterflies in the old tum.

1041
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:03,207
I had the same thing, son, only
mine were bloody great bat.

1042
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,090
Ta.
Right.

1043
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,127
Well, hero's to the first baby.

1044
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,368
Oh, turn it up, Dad.
Don't rush it.

1045
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,169
I shall never forget the day you were horn.
It was Guy Fawkes Night.

1046
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,964
- I know.
- How do you know ?

1047
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,610
- It’s my birthday.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1048
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,768
Well, I remember walking home from the hospital.
All the rockets and fireworks are going off.

1049
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,248
I remember wondering what you were gonna be like.
You know, what you were gonna do.

1050
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,884
I never thought about marriage then.

1051
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,047
Me neithar.

1052
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,564
Dad, what the bloody hall are you doing ?

1053
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,969
I'm toasting the bridegroom.
You want for a pea, not a plus-up !

1054
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,209
Go on. They're waiting for you downstairs.
You're coming with me. Come on.

1055
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,603
Oh, God, now I want to go !
Hey ! Wait for us in the Mini

1056
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,485
Hey, Fred, how about that
for a Nice place of crumpet, eh ?

1057
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,966
Where ?

1058
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,565
Sea-through charlies and all.

1059
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,649
Yeah. Wonder If she wants
a lift to Bristol.

1060
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,481
Her Bristols don't need no lifting, Matai Come on.
Give us a hand with this.

1061
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,121
I often wonder why some of them bother
to wear anything at all these days.

1062
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,367
I'm glad they don't,
mate.

1063
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,687
You would.

1064
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,370
Timmol

1065
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,925
Right, off we go.

1066
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,690
Now what ?

1067
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,722
I'm glad you're all right. I was
afraid there'd been an accident.

1068
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,448
Well, we had to stop
because Dad nearly had one.

1069
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,846
Lovely day for it.

1070
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:21,840
Better still If we'd got the groom.
He's right behind. Sid's bringing him.

1071
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,369
I can't understand it.
He’s such a dependable boy.

1072
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,131
If he says he’s going to do
something, he always does it.

1073
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,324
It’s a little more than saying he’s going
to do something. He’s going to get married.

1074
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:48,490
Here they come.
About bleeding time too.

1075
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,523
Dad !
Well, it bloody is.

1076
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,527
Where's Timmy, then ?
I was hoping he was here.

1077
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,927
But you were bringing him.
Yeah, but I lost him.

1078
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,361
Don't worry, love.
He can't be far away.

1079
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,286
He’s probably
just lost his way, dear.

1080
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,561
Here he comes.

1081
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,842
I'm afraid that's
the next wedding.

1082
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,241
But we haven't
finished this one yet.

1083
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,329
I fear you're well
over your time, slr.

1084
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,249
Can't you slide us
down one, vicar ?

1085
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,091
Well, I might just
squeeze you in at 4:00.

1086
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,207
If you think I'm
sitting here until 4:00 o’clock ...

1087
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,922
Ho, no, no. Of course not. Besides,
my man have to go on duty later on.

1088
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,849
There are lots of criminals abroad, you know.

1089
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,087
Not only abroad.

1090
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,530
It’s so unlike Timmy.

1091
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,404
- is it ?
- Oh, yes.

1092
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,762
I mean, I'm sure he hasn't eloped.

1093
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,282
Elopad, madam ? Tell me,
how many girls is he engaged to ?

1094
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:18,762
Uh, okay, uh, why don't we go back to the
reception hall. At least he knows where that is.

1095
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,602
He, no, look, you see, reporting it to the
engineers isn't gonna get me married, ls it ?

1096
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,731
What ?

1097
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,847
Hello ?

1098
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,847
<i>No ?</i>

1099
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,008
Bloody reception-hall phone's out of order.

1100
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,448
1.20, including the phone.

1101
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,486
Um, how far is it to London ?
Oh, about, uh, 60 miles.

1102
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,000
Oh ...

1103
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,167
We still haven't served the wine, sir.

1104
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,921
Look, I really don't think we should open
the champagne until we've had the wedding.

1105
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,169
Quito right. I'm only here for the bear anyway.

1106
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,842
And I'm only here, sir, because your
son is supposed to marry my daughter.

1107
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,362
Don't worry. He'll be here. Unless,
of course, he’s been arrested.

1108
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,403
- What would be he arrested for ?
- I don't know.

1109
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,523
Your mob don't always
give reasons, do they ?

1110
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,051
mob, as you ...

1111
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,321
No of fence.
Yes, all right.

1112
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,681
Just a figure of speech.

1113
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,121
I've got a lot of respect for the police.

1114
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,287
Thank you, yes.

1115
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,448
Anybody ever calls them
bastards, I always deny it.

1116
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,723
I'm sure the commissioner will be
most happy to know about that.

1117
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,491
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like a word with my wife.

1118
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,971
Well,
your health.

1119
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,400
Down the hatch.

1120
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,728
Ah, John, dear, I was
just telling Mrs. Lea,

1121
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,410
If Timothy had been
Involved in an accident,

1122
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,170
the police would be the
first to hear about it.

1123
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,328
Oh, yes, certainly,
certainly. My mob ...

1124
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,841
Have already checked the hospitals.

1125
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,448
Mind you, he could've lost his memory.

1126
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,405
Or his nerve.
Oh, no, he’s plenty of nerve.

1127
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,729
Well, you have to,
cleaning windows.

1128
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,366
Timmy’s like Sidney.
He'll go up anything.

1129
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,644
Here we are, ladies.
Reinforcement.

1130
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,285
Oh, ta. Sidney,
do you remember

1131
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,721
when you was an hour late for our wedding ?

1132
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,321
Do I ? I broke the zip on me trousers !

1133
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,888
Yes, well, one hour's
a little different to three hours.

1134
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,047
Oh ...

1135
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:13,926
Oh, God. It’s baby's feeding time.
I've gotta take these back.

1136
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,526
Right, love,
come on, then.

1137
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,684
You can do it style In the Rolls.

1138
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,362
<i>Oh ... I won't say see you revival
because I'll see you again later.</i>

1139
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,527
Come on.

1140
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,726
Look, darling, why don't you go and
have a little chat with Aunt Maisie.

1141
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,443
She's in quite good form for a change.

1142
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,449
I have nothing to say to Aunt Maisie.

1143
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,369
Well, I don't like to see you
sitting here by yourself.

1144
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,722
Daddy, do stop fussing. I'm okay.

1145
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,011
Hello, Johnny. did you
hear the one about the fella ...

1146
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,771
who gave up drink for the
sake of his wife and kidneys ?

1147
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,485
That's bloody marvellous !

1148
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,727
Hi.

1149
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,564
I brought you some grub.
You're getting slashed.

1150
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,727
Wouldn't you get slashed ?

1151
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,763
Yeah, but you ought to
soak it up with something.

1152
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,285
Apart from anything else, I feel
such a twlt in this wedding dress.

1153
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,561
You look gorgeous.

1154
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,281
Stood up at the
bloody altar. Ho !

1155
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,767
Yeah, well.
Maybe it’s for the beet.

1156
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,766
And what does that mean ?

1157
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,122
Well, I don't honestly think
Timmy was ready for marriage.

1158
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,409
So you told him to run for his life ?

1159
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,682
Me ? Christ, no !
I was all for it.

1160
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,364
Okay, I had my doubts to begin with.
Then I began to envy him.

1161
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,567
Why, you're a very attractive woman, Liz.

1162
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,043
If I wasn't married,
I'd be tempted to resolve.

1163
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,644
You really are a smooth bastard, aren't you ?

1164
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:41,807
What did I say ?

1165
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,566
You can't even talk to a jilted
bride without trying to pull her.

1166
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,162
I was only commentating.
I don't want commentation.

1167
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,489
I just want to get out of this
bloody place and this bloody outfit.

1168
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,361
So, what's stopping you ?

1169
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,766
I'll nlp round the side. I've got my van outside.
I'll run you home.

1170
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,005
I can't leave just like that.

1171
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,527
Now, why not ?

1172
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,563
I'll come straight back here
and tell them ...

1173
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,642
You had an attack
of the vapours. Hmm ?

1174
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,167
Come on. Come on.

1175
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,366
<i>It could only happen to me.
I even get seasick looking at boats !</i>

1176
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,722
<i>Talk about "Get me
to the church on time. "</i>

1177
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,729
<i>I'll probably turn up
and throw up.</i>

1178
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,569
<i>Church ? He ! I didn't even
make the reception !</i>

1179
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,963
<i>I thought of calling the house, but I might've
got her old man and a coin up my tread.</i>

1180
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,967
<i>As for my feet, well,
I'd worn them off.</i>

1181
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,244
<i>They felt like the end
of my legs turned up.</i>

1182
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,371
<i>The house looked even darker
than my matrimonial future.</i>

1183
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:27,962
<i>They were either all asleep or inspector Radiett was
lurking behind the door, his truncheon in his hand.</i>

1184
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,810
<i>Terrific wedding night.
Everyone in bed but the groom.</i>

1185
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,966
<i>And up there was my
place of nuptial bliss.</i>

1186
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:51,725
<i>Question was, how could Romeo get to
Juliet without his bleeding ladder ?</i>

1187
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,367
Sid,
behave yourself !

1188
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,002
I said, I'm going to have
to put you in handcuffs.

1189
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,603
No hard feelings,
then, Timmy, eh ?

1190
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,326
Of course not, Sid. Probably saved me
from a fate worse than death anyway.

1191
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,889
Yeah, well, I won't be up
any ladders for a while.

1192
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,764
Not to worry, Sid.
I got it all fixed up.

1193
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,200
Got a new boy starting tomorrow.

1194
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,201
And remember, In our business ...

1195
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,244
you gotta be Immune from
shocks, especially from birds.

1196
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,523
As long as they're satisfied customers,
they bring in the new ones, right ?

1197
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,206
Right.
Right.

1198
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,728
If you ever want
your windows cleaned ...

1199
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,606
I live on a houseboat.

1200
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,371
Fair enough. I might even
do your porthole for nothing.
