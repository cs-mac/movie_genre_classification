FACE

12
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,981
Found in the sand again?

13
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,450
I wonder the look upon death.

14
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,691
This is the fourth skull.

15
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,425
I'm sorry for leaving
at a time like this.

16
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,931
Not that I don't understand,

17
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,173
but the police need faces
reconstructed ASAP.

18
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,004
You're the only hope they have.

19
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,044
I've made up my mind, sir.

20
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,810
You might feel better
working at home.

21
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,318
No daily report is necessary.

22
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,417
I never heard your resignation request!

23
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,721
I'll tell them you're on leave.
You hear me?

24
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,738
- Increase dopamine by 10 micro.
- Sir

25
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,308
Keep it under 80 cc an hour.

26
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,777
She's now stabilized.
It will pass.

27
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,983
It wasn't this bad
when you operated on her last year.

28
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,683
Like I said before,
your daughter is Beta-allergic.

29
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,248
2 to 3 years of observation
is crucial.

30
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,987
Considering cells are adapting,
it's pretty normal.

31
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,400
And the transplanted heart
needs time to settle in.

32
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,167
Don't be too worried.

33
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:40,832
But it's gotten worse recently.
How could I not?

34
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,102
I was wondering...

35
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,411
What if the donor had
heart issues?

36
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,251
Can I meet the donor's family?

37
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,579
The heart was fine.

38
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,921
I checked it out myself.
I ensure you.

39
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,559
Doctor?

40
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,961
I'd like to meet the family
just in case.

41
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,498
They don't want to be exposed.

42
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,544
Take her home.
Take her somewhere

43
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,111
quiet and peaceful.

44
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,673
Take a good care of her.
She'll be just fine.

45
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,981
Here comes ice-cold beer!

46
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,144
I thought I was the owner here.
Here you go.

47
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,425
Han-su, should I leave the hospital
and open up a cafe too?

48
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,086
Shut up and drink.

49
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,822
No more doctor-turned
cafe owner please.

50
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,827
I know a pediatrician was
your childhood dream.

51
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,130
Sun-young, you're the last
person to give her advice.

52
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,203
You reconstruct faces
for God's sake.

53
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:23,197
That's right. Face Reconstruction
wasn't even a required course.

54
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,774
Did you take it too?

55
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,675
I dropped it after the first class.

56
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,746
I don't know what got into her.

57
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,545
She worked harder than
anybody in the class.

58
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,344
She simply changed boats.

59
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,717
That's what life is all about.

60
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,352
Your fate changes
before you even know it.

61
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,825
That's the fun part of life.

62
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,658
I'm getting thirsty here.
Cut the chitchat

63
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,765
and let's make a toast, guys.

64
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
- To our scuba club!
- Sure.

65
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,927
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

66
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,728
The air is good!

67
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,708
Today is the first anniversary
of our scuba club.

68
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:59,405
Let's take a picture.
Gather around, guys.

69
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,146
Ready?

70
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,217
Hey, get your arm off Sun-young.

71
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,149
It doesn't belong there.

72
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,012
Here we go.
One, two...

73
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,215
Flippers!

74
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,319
Excited to see grandma?

75
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,227
We'll go fishing too, Jin.

76
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,933
I bought a fishing pole
for you.

77
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,138
Okay?

78
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,254
Don't be sick, my pumpkin.

79
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,426
Tell me.
Is she really okay?

80
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:53,855
Yes.
She just needs some rest.

81
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,468
She'll be better off out here.

82
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,503
I'll wrap things up in Seoul
and hurry back.

83
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,001
It's okay, sweetheart.

84
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:27,692
Her mom was so worried
that she smiled too much.

85
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:34,033
But I haven't seen her smile
since her mother died.

86
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,176
My poor baby!

87
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:34,315
Daddy, Mommy...
And this is me.

88
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,853
Her parents sent test results
to Cleveland Clinic,

89
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,946
requesting a heart transplant
on her.

90
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,650
Meanwhile, her conditions
have gotten worse.

91
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,050
- Cleveland Clinic?
- Yes.

92
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,763
Having no experience with
Beta-allergic cases,

93
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:53,231
they refused to accept her.

94
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,562
Moreover, they recommended you
for the surgery.

95
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,133
Which means they know that
you have a 100% success rate

96
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:03,297
in performing heart transplants
on Beta-allergic patients.

97
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,071
What about the match?

98
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,481
Not found yet.

99
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,608
But I'm sure we'll find one soon.

100
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:18,314
How?
By sitting around in here?

101
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,853
- Go find me one now!
- Yes, sir.

102
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,393
This is a great opportunity.

103
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,263
For what?

104
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,463
The patient's grandfather.

105
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,699
He's the president of
Jin-myung Corp.

106
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,043
The 3rd biggest company
in the country...

107
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,511
How does that relate to this?

108
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,948
If the surgery is successful,

109
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,575
he might donate...

110
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,448
If you have time to daydream,
make another round!

111
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,521
Yes, sir.

112
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,801
Mr. LEE Hyun-min?

113
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,039
Yes?

114
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:18,047
Nice to meet you. I'm JUNG Sun-young,
newcomer to the Institute.

115
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,955
This is the skull you need to...

116
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,979
Go back.

117
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,450
Wait!

118
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,426
The director is away on business.

119
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,237
Look.

120
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,038
Name's JUNG Sun-young.

121
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,448
I'm not in any condition to work.
With all due respect...

122
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,385
Worried I might get in the way?

123
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,753
Take this back.

124
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,024
I'm not just a messenger.

125
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,532
My job is to assist you
to reconstruct it.

126
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,739
Can I have a glass of water?

127
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,712
I'll fill you in later.

128
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,320
So stop spying on me and leave.

129
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,549
You said the same thing last time
and gave me nothing.

130
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,988
How is that my fault?

131
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,096
This crazy ass melted down
the whole body.

132
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,400
Look. To cover up their crimes,

133
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,033
some assholes cut off fingers
or pull out teeth.

134
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,610
But melting the body like this...

135
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,038
What?

136
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,644
Wait a second.

137
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,653
He melted the whole body.
Why?

138
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,251
He didn't want us to find out

139
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,094
what was wrong with it.

140
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,503
I guess God is watching over her.

141
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,944
- Prepare the operation.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:46,919
Scalpel.

143
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,723
- ACC on.
- ACC on.

144
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,665
Clamps.

145
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,508
- Close her up well.
- Okay.

146
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,398
What are you doing here alone?

147
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,907
Jin, let's go home.

148
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:47,740
Jin?

149
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,322
Good morning!

150
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,094
I'm here to help you
with the work.

151
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,803
Look, Miss.

152
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,671
I told you the other day.
Name's JUNG Sun-young.

153
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,773
Look, Ms. JUNG.

154
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,907
What's wrong with you?

155
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,617
Who said you could leave
the skull here?

156
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,811
Fine.

157
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,352
If you won't work on it,
I'll take it back.

158
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,757
Go ahead.
I haven't even touched it.

159
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,375
I see you've already started.

160
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,305
Hyun-min.

161
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,408
The skull?

162
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,644
I understand things are tough
for you.

163
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,125
But...
Think of the victim's family.

164
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,059
Without knowing whether...

165
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,322
I have one of my own.

166
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,124
Can't you reconsider it?

167
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,526
Please go back.

168
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,460
That victim has lost a face.

169
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,398
Whoever it was deserves one.

170
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,977
And you can get it back.
Please.

171
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:06,483
Get in!

172
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,652
Who are those punks?

173
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,157
Loan sharks and organ traffickers.
They might know something.

174
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:13,715
I'll squeeze them out.

175
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,890
I'm also checking the victims'
credit card transactions.

176
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,155
Credit cards?
What for?

177
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,394
If those female victims
sold their organs,

178
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:26,071
it must've been for money, right?

179
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:26,662
Right.

180
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,296
That's why I've found out.

181
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,605
They all had their hearts scanned.

182
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,077
Isn't that strange?

183
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:38,481
Not to me, man.
Must be a coincidence.

184
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,709
Your ears are fine.

185
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,844
Yet, science and logic can't
explain everything.

186
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,354
A psycho-pathologic matter
such as an illusion...

187
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,359
...stems from a series of troubles.

188
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,051
It wasn't an illusion.

189
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:49,599
I saw it clearly.
Right before my eyes...

190
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,494
It did happen.

191
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,854
I'll prescribe pills for you.
Get some rest.

192
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:02,502
Try to take it easy
and you'll feel much better.

193
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,439
Fine.
I'll find your face back!

194
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,807
You checked her out, didn't you?

195
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,504
I sure did.

196
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,040
She had a very unique composition.

197
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,449
It's called Beta-allergy.

198
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,182
I had only read about it
until she came to me.

199
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,124
What's Beta-allergy anyway?

200
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,787
Let me put it this way.

201
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,123
O- type blood can be
given to anybody.

202
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,527
But it can only receive
from the same type, right?

203
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:32,568
Naturally.

204
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,331
Same for Beta-allergy patients.

205
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,201
If organs of a different composition
are transplanted,

206
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,539
severe side effects result.

207
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,279
Like acute allergic disease...

208
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,821
That apron looks good on you.

209
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,934
You're gonna sneak off again
leaving that behind?

210
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:07,504
It's called Love Plant.
It grows well year around.

211
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,099
All it needs to bloom is your love.
Amazing, isn't it?

212
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,712
Water it every now and then.
It will appreciate it.

213
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,347
- Are you always like this?
- What?

214
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:23,012
Doing things in your own way,
regardless of others' opinions?

215
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,723
Well, let's get to work.

216
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:31,054
I always work alone.
And...

217
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,557
Tell the director that this is it.

218
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:40,236
Are you always like this?
Refuse and see what happens?

219
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,573
We're racing the clock
on this one.

220
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,870
I have all the basics down

221
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,938
on facial reconstruction.

222
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,779
And I was trained enough
to not get in the way.

223
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:59,082
I've been told
that you're the only doctor

224
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,988
who can perform a heart transplant
on Beta-allergic patients.

225
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,685
That's not entirely true.

226
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,032
It's just that a heart transplant

227
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,168
is a complicated procedure.

228
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,534
And with Beta-allergic patients,

229
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,834
you never know what might
happen on the table.

230
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,408
From what I heard

231
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,376
Beta allergic heart disease patients...

232
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,143
...run a higher risk of failure.

233
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,979
Neither surgery nor medicine
can cure it.

234
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,887
A heart transplant is a must.
Is that correct?

235
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,386
Yes, that's correct.

236
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,593
It seems you've never had
problems finding donors.

237
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:44,861
We receive help
from an Organ Donation Center.

238
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:49,372
I see.
Thanks for your time.

239
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,686
It's a girl, isn't it?

240
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,327
On what basis?

241
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,126
What?

242
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,491
Any reason to believe
the victim is female?

243
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,439
The skull is rather small.

244
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,708
For a man, a mastoid usually sits
below the back of the skull.

245
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,415
But it's the other way around
for this one.

246
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,913
The chin is almost rounded.

247
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:40,190
And the front R is vertical,
not askew.

248
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:45,162
Oh! The angular bone is quite sharp

249
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,720
which is also good evidence.

250
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,962
Children and females' skulls
share many similarities.

251
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,403
So don’t jump to conclusions.

252
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,201
Internet searching is much faster.

253
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,608
Type Dr. YOON on the net

254
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,840
and see how many come up.

255
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,672
Will you go through them all?

256
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,750
Get to it!

257
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,204
What are you doing?

258
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,005
Who told you to touch it?

259
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,475
- I was just...
- You made facial muscles too thick!

260
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,487
- By theory, it's...
- Theory?

261
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,818
What theory?

262
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,993
One that says facial muscles
can't be this thin?

263
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,832
Listen. What muscle is this?

264
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,034
Masseter muscle.

265
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,204
Considering the smooth surface,

266
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,443
neither masseter muscle nor
zygomatic major can be thick.

267
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,953
Facial muscles vary distinctively

268
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:50,545
by the person.

269
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:55,849
That's why we look different.

270
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,589
Touch my face.

271
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,261
Here. Masseter muscle.
Zygomatic major.

272
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,463
They're different from yours.

273
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,740
If not sure, touch yours.

274
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,271
Here. And here.

275
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,537
Your hair.

276
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,910
What?

277
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,775
Do something about it, will you?

278
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,117
My hair?

279
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,085
It's quite distracting.

280
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:09,592
Let's see.
What should I do with it?

281
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,736
Satisfied?

282
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,212
Wanna give it a shot?

283
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:01,976
Seriously?

284
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,153
This is the most important part.

285
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,852
If the finishing touch is off,

286
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,227
you will end up creating
a whole new face.

287
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,402
- What?
- Your hand.

288
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:52,089
It's okay now.
Feels better.

289
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:57,797
I'd often feel my fingers
going numb too.

290
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,101
Anything on my face?

291
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,642
I just wanna look at a living
person's face.

292
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,186
We've been seeing only dead ones.

293
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:27,163
You do smile!
I thought you were a rock.

294
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:38,901
Hello? What?

295
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,109
Where are you now?
Okay.

296
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,145
Hyun-min!

297
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,362
- Mother.
- Oh, you're here.

298
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,164
- Can you believe this?
- Jin.

299
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:16,006
I was so scared. She was
burning up and so pale.

300
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,877
Doctors have no idea
what the problem is.

301
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,410
Why does this keep happening?

302
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,387
Only God knows!

303
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,643
- Doctor!
- Yes?

304
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,903
We'll change hospitals.

305
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,805
Why would you do that?

306
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,584
You say she's fine,

307
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,110
but she's getting worse!

308
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,049
What are you talking about?

309
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,388
Her heart is perfectly fine.

310
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,793
So is the tissue response.

311
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,855
She's sick because her body reacts
habitually to the pain it's used to.

312
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,195
Tell me who donated the heart.

313
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:50,274
I wanna check the case history
of the donor.

314
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:52,708
I told you it was impossible!

315
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,672
Please reconsider it.

316
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,619
If the donor was fine as you say,

317
00:42:01,654 --> 00:42:04,281
why can't you tell me?

318
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,523
I'm taking her out of here.

319
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,137
How did you...

320
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,729
Sorry I ran out on you.
I wasn't myself.

321
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,009
Can I hold onto them?

322
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:12,147
I won't touch the skull
without your consent.

323
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,095
Jin will be fine.

324
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,360
She looks so much like you.

325
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,394
The surgery was a success.

326
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,296
And the chart says she's fine.

327
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:04,238
Nothing's wrong
with her transplanted heart?

328
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:09,245
So he held out on you
about the donor?

329
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,478
Right.

330
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,816
There's a confidentiality issue.

331
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,886
But when the patient isn't well,

332
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,549
and you demand so strongly,
it's natural for doctors to tell.

333
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,759
What do you suggest?

334
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,193
Now she's my patient.

335
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,432
They'll have to turn over
all the records.

336
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,713
Case number 278.

337
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,790
A female in her mid 20s.

338
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,486
Found in the sand...

339
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:03,761
Hello there.

340
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:13,466
You cleaned?
You shouldn't have.

341
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,744
5 minutes after, I regretted it.

342
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,135
How are things at NISI?

343
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:50,146
I mean...
Dealing with dead bodies,

344
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,976
that's no picnic.

345
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,744
We live in a fucked-up...

346
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,314
Excuse my language.

347
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,749
I got it!

348
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,561
CHO Hye-ran.
It's Ki-bok's daughter.

349
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:05,994
The address?

350
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,389
Didn't he skip town?

351
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,526
He's a dirty dog.

352
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:18,575
He stayed cool for a while
after his daughter died.

353
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,372
Then he left town.

354
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,846
It was a horrible death.

355
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,349
It must've shocked him a lot.

356
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,582
How did she die?

357
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,713
It was horrible.

358
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:36,883
She was deaf.
And a bit lost up here.

359
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,322
She would run around town
all day long.

360
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,161
One day she was hit by a train.

361
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,733
By a train?

362
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:50,866
It was bad. Real bad.

363
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,882
Her heart?

364
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:06,981
Her body tore into pieces.
What do you think?

365
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,857
Excuse me!
Where are you going?

366
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,535
- I need to see Dr. YOON.
- He's not in right now.

367
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,993
You can't go in there!

368
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,334
Sir!

369
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,566
Is this the surgery record
you were looking for?

370
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,110
The donor was CHO Hye-ran.

371
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,875
She got killed by a train.

372
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,480
- She did?
- Yes.

373
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,654
The body was damaged
beyond recognition.

374
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,418
This record is fake.

375
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,662
There must be a record
on the real donor.

376
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,733
Dr. YOON's name keeps coming up.

377
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,138
Trafficking of drugs,
the donor for your girl...

378
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:33,740
Is your daughter, by any chance,
Beta-allergic?

379
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,639
Yes, and she had a heart disease.

380
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,716
Pull up the heart surgery records
on Beta-allergic patients.

381
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,083
What's going on?

382
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,891
All the victims were
Beta-allergic.

383
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:55,424
He tampered with the records.

384
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,397
Therefore he's the suspect?

385
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,730
I say that's lame.

386
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:03,534
Captain, Berg-Benzene was used
to melt down the bodies.

387
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,573
It's a special chemical that can
only be used at hospitals.

388
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,172
Take a look.

389
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,907
The amount used at his hospital
is double of others.

390
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,676
And Dr. YOON authorized
the purchase order.

391
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,447
Furthermore, all the victims
were Beta-allergic.

392
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,115
And Dr. YOON specializes
in heart transplants

393
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,125
on those Beta-allergic patients.

394
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,923
That face reconstruction guy...

395
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,394
He's been working on the 4th skull

396
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,591
and suspects that it might
belong to the donor

397
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,429
who gave his daughter the heart.

398
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,776
Fine.
Get the arrest warned issued.

399
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,203
- Go pick him up.
- Okay.

400
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,424
I just sent the results.

401
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:05,021
Call me as soon
as you confirm the ID.

402
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,587
Okay, I'll be waiting.

403
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:32,138
KIM Sun-mi, 27. Reported
missing in October 2000.

404
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,480
In 2000...

405
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,485
Damn, he got his hopes up
for nothing.

406
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,589
- Hey, Detective SUH.
- Yes.

407
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:26,266
- What have you got?
- Take a look.

408
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,871
See the mark here?

409
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,271
It's from the rope tied
around the neck.

410
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,273
And this.

411
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:37,736
This thin deep scar here?
It's the cause of death.

412
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:42,215
What are you saying?
Somebody killed him beforehand?

413
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,216
You don't die twice, do you?

414
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:43,340
When I was little,
I lived by the sea.

415
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:48,106
I loved playing with the sand.

416
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,852
I built everything with it.
So soft...

417
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,926
And it was warm with the sun.

418
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:03,694
But, you know what?
Underneath the sand...

419
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,062
It's very cold.

420
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,044
You know the area well?

421
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,383
Huh?

422
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,325
I don't think the scenery is
that breathtaking.

423
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,592
I know.

424
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:53,811
Good night.

425
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,482
Wait.

426
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,959
Thanks for inviting me today.

427
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,029
Thanks for coming with me.

428
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:14,334
Good night.

429
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,714
What the hell were you thinking?
Trying to get yourself killed?

430
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,964
Dr. YOON had these on him.

431
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,833
I stopped by at the hospital.

432
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,532
None of the doctors knew
where the hearts came from.

433
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:49,109
They said they were delivered
2 hours prior to the surgeries.

434
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,632
- Hello.
- Hi.

435
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:15,098
It was sent out from here.

436
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,504
- Whose PO Box is this?
- One moment please.

437
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,783
Not going well?

438
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:25,123
It’s been buried in the sand
for a long time.

439
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,001
I think...

440
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:34,571
It should be more like this.

441
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:52,118
This skull isn't like the others.
You have to find out who this was.

442
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,358
For your daughter.

443
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:09,935
This is it.

444
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:11,564
Okay.

445
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,095
- How are you?
- Sun-young!

446
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,467
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

447
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,105
So hard to see you!

448
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,274
I've been busy.

449
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,980
A diving tour has been set.

450
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,538
You're coming, right?

451
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,947
I don't know.
I'll have to see.

452
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,647
You missed it last time
after the medical checkup.

453
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,887
- That busy?
- No.

454
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:09,761
It's not only my work,
but my mom isn't so well.

455
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,129
What's wrong?
She's sick?

456
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:17,935
I can never be a good daughter.
I only do things I want to.

457
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,364
What's the occasion?

458
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,335
I just feel like drinking.

459
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,785
Quite good.

460
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,164
- Sun-young.
- Yeah?

461
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:30,744
What if someone needs your help?

462
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,308
What would you do?

463
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:39,121
What do you mean?

464
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:44,616
Nothing.

465
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:54,967
Never mind.
You don't have to answer.

466
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:07,213
Isn't she the victim?

467
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:11,381
LEE Ji-eun.
Art Climbing Club.

468
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,852
- So is this one.
- Right.

469
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,450
KIM Sun-mi.
Sky Love Club.

470
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,523
Look at these photos.

471
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,596
KIM Han-su...

472
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,325
Captain, we got him.

473
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,221
Name's KIM Han-su.

474
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,889
Dr. YOON gave him the list

475
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,761
of young females from
various leisure clubs.

476
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,267
And KIM carried out the killings.

477
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,865
What? That's right.

478
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,974
We're on our way to his cafe.

479
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,406
JUNG Sun-young?
Who's that?

480
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,974
I never hired such a researcher.

481
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:12,633
A year ago,
she said she was going out.

482
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,973
Not a word from her since.

483
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,209
It's been a while.

484
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:16,024
I never expected to see you here.
What a surprise.

485
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,787
How's your daughter doing?

486
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,662
Who are you?

487
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,301
It was about this time last year.

488
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:32,873
In front of the surgery room, I saw you
crying, holding your little girl.

489
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,936
We have met?

490
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,905
I know you well.

491
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:43,311
Seeing your tears, I decided
to kill Sun-young.

492
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,747
My son...

493
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:52,958
He couldn't find a heart
and struggled for 3 years.

494
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,360
Then I promised him.

495
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,094
That I'd never...

496
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:02,760
That I'd never let children die
like he did.

497
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,607
I'm just keeping that promise.

498
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:13,675
It wouldn't have been possible
without Dr. YOON, though.

499
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,551
Even after he figured out
how I got the hearts,

500
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,153
he didn't turn me in.

501
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,682
On the other hand,
he encouraged me.

502
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:30,229
He did his part well.
But he let it go to his head.

503
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:37,428
Since you've come this far,

504
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:43,642
you might as well experience
how Sun-young died.

505
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:33,824
She lived for over 20 years,
doing things she wanted.

506
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:37,357
What about your daughter?

507
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:42,070
She hasn't had a chance yet,
has she?

508
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:47,936
That heart beat over 900 million times
in Sun-young's body.

509
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:52,604
I simply gave it to a new owner.

510
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:57,078
What I'm doing is...
absolutely right!

511
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,721
Nobody...

512
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:12,159
Nobody can blame me.

513
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,462
Got that?

514
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:19,903
Freeze!

515
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,091
Hyun-min, are you okay?

516
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:43,088
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

517
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,423
Detective SUH!

518
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,330
It's Berg-Benzene.

519
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:16,556
Daddy, let's play together.

520
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,899
Let me clean this up first.
Then we can play.

521
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,570
Can you wait?

522
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,631
- Okay.
- You're such a doll.

523
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:39,179
- A female in her...
- It's Daddy's voice.

524
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:44,221
Found in the sand...

525
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,426
I'll get it, Daddy.

526
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,263
Don't run.
You're gonna get hurt.

527
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,333
Hyun-min.

528
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:22,321
If you're listening to this,
it means you're well, right?

529
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:36,069
You can consider it a dream
and forget about it.

530
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:44,985
If you don't want to believe it,
that's fine too.

531
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:48,081
But...

532
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,693
Looking back...

533
01:18:54,963 --> 01:19:00,265
I've never been happier.

534
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,344
Be happy, Hyun-min.

535
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:19,715
Daddy, what are you doing?

536
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:30,687
Jin. I love you so much.

537
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:32,533
I do too!
