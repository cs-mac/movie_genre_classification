5
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,597
             Santa?

6
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,132
Ahh!

7
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,000
        Holy crap, Boyd.

8
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,236
    What the hell you doing
       back there, buddy?

9
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,804
    Waiting on Santa Claus?

10
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,240
Aren't you getting
 a little old for Santa Claus?

11
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,575
I'm five.

12
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,344
          It's all a sham, Boyd.
         The whole Goddamn deal.

13
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,913
            I'm the only Santa
         you're ever gonna know.

14
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,183
     If you know the truth,
it's easy to get through it all.

15
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,853
             In fact, let's see
            what he brought you.

16
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:04,056
<i>-  Meet my father,</i>
<i>-  Mitch Mitchler.</i>

17
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,892
All we need is
  a couple of Chinese workers.

18
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,261
<i> He was a little</i>
       <i> bit complicated.</i>

19
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:19,071
               ¶

20
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,975
<i> Maybe I was destined to become</i>
 <i> an overcompensator as a dad,</i>

21
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,979
   <i> Christmas being the most</i>
<i> obvious manifestation of that.</i>

22
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,947
      Alright, here we go.
    Okay, lean in, everyone.

23
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,750
<i> I'm also a realist.</i>

24
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,353
 <i> I can't control everything--</i>
  <i> the weather, for instance.</i>

25
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,155
    Look Dad, it's snowing!

26
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,357
           Well, Bug,
   that's actually fake snow.

27
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,092
   Because of global warming.

28
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,060
<i> The warmest winter</i>
   <i> on record in the Midwest</i>

29
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,963
<i> assured a non-white Christmas.</i>

30
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,800
   <i> The bigger issue by far,</i>
   <i> was the Santa conundrum.</i>

31
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,837
     <i> Vera was very much on</i>
    <i> the fence, Santa-wise.</i>

32
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,673
  <i> But Douglas still believed.</i>

33
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,974
 Dad, why are there two Santas?

34
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,376
<i> But for how much longer?</i>

35
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,911
That guy's not Santa, Bug.

36
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,512
       He probably smells
    like pee and burnt hair

37
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,914
 because he's a welfare person.

38
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,948
Vera!

39
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,416
    Santa's not real anyway.

40
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,286
     Santa's not real, Dad?

41
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,621
    Of course Santa's real.

42
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,823
       No one's not real.

43
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,927
        Everyone's real,
        including Santa.

44
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,265
      Vera, a word please.

45
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,101
  Whatever you think you know,
        Vera, you don't.

46
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,370
     Most kids in my class
don't believe in Santa anymore.

47
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,673
      But Madison and me--
     I mean Madison and I,

48
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,276
      we kinda still did,
 except that Madison's sister,

49
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:34,980
        the one who did
      the BJ to this kid--

50
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,282
      Uh, Vera, you don't
   actually know what the B--

51
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,252
      what that expression
         means, do you?

52
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,954
    It stands for butt jam,
    and I think it has to do

53
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,056
       with jamming stuff
    up your butt for money,

54
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,424
          but anyway,
       Madison's sister,

55
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,693
  she showed us this website,
          nosanta.org.

56
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,062
   Well, Madison's sister is
  a deceitful little strumpet.

57
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,897
         What Dad means
       is that it's okay

58
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,633
       for you to decide
  about Santa, but Douglas...

59
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,969
    He absolutely believes.

60
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,136
      And we won't want to
          do anything

61
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,105
       to spoil Christmas
        for him, right?

62
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,141
           Oh, right,
 I won't spoil it for Bug, Dad.

63
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,476
             Sorry.

64
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,478
           Thank you.

65
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,385
      You are a very kind
    and generous young man.

66
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,688
       And you are going
      to have a very merry

67
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,658
     and special Christmas.

68
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,860
          Oh ho ho ho!

69
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,270
Hey, you wanna...

70
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,408
       I wasn't gonna ask
    if you wanna smoke meth

71
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,210
       or kill a drifter.

72
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,779
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

73
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,448
    I just-- I'm exhausted.

74
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,483
         I'm with you.

75
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,084
  I just thought I should ask.

76
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,220
         One day we're
     gonna have to, right?

77
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:51,823
    Or, we could just enjoy
the slow descent into celibacy.

78
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,298
         How many years
   do you think Bug has left

79
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,902
    where he walks into the
 living room Christmas morning,

80
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,705
       he sees the tree,

81
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,107
         and presents,
    his stomach just drops,

82
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,278
 because holy crap, Santa came?

83
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:20,452
  Can you imagine still having
 that kind of belief in magic?

84
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,123
    Yeah, it's really cool.

85
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:29,094
          Do you think
    you're overcompensating

86
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,096
        on the Christmas
       thing, just a tad?

87
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,198
         Overcompens--
    on the Christmas thing?

88
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,133
No! I don't think that
            at all.

89
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,401
      He's six years old.

90
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,337
   Okay, this is
your brother, again.

91
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,805
                           Pass.

92
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,007
   You can't keep pretending
   your family doesn't exist.

93
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,242
     I'm pretty sure I can.

94
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,945
  Come on babe, take the call,
  before it wakes the kids up.

95
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,483
          Hi, Nelson.

96
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,652
- Whoa, that is spooky.
- How'd you know it was me?

97
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,887
<i> We have caller ID,</i>
   <i> so your number comes up.</i>

98
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,290
 Just right there on the phone?

99
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,292
    Boy, that is something.
    I gotta look into that.

100
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,893
        You know, that's
     a miracle of science.

101
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:02,894
        <i> Yeah, you bet.</i>

102
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,364
     Hold on one sec, Boyd.

103
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,768
       Sorry to call you
      so late by the way.

104
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,503
        Is it night time
      where you are, too?

105
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,805
     No, it's 10 here too,
 because Chicago and Wisconsin-

106
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,142
What is in the same time zone!

107
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,444
         Yeah, we're in
      the same time zone.

108
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:23,281
   I don't know if you caught
 that, I said it like Jeopardy.

109
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,583
          <i> So anyway.</i>

110
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,052
   Oh, oh, right. So anyway,
    I'm calling to tell you:

111
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,355
     I scored myself a kid,
    a little boy. I'm a dad.

112
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,757
            Really?

113
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,924
  He seems to have procreated.

114
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,192
             Eeww.

115
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,728
     I was calling to say,

116
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,263
I want you to be the godfather.

117
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,899
            Really?
     We would be honoured.

118
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,601
  That is just the best, Boyd.

119
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,337
       Jeez, that is so--
    I know it's short notice

120
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,472
 but the baptism's on the 24th.

121
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,775
  <i> Oh, absolutely. We wouldn't</i>
    <i> miss it for the world.</i>

122
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:50,842
             Sweet.

123
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,344
    Uh, January or February?

124
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,312
       No Boyd, December.
         December 24th.

125
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,680
   Oh, you can't wait for it.

126
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,282
        December? What?

127
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,853
Nelson, you can't have a baptism
       on Christmas Eve.

128
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,722
          It doesn't--

129
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,224
      Wait that would mean

130
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:10,262
     that I'd have to spend
      Christmas with Dad.

131
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,631
    I'll smoke in my Goddamn
      house if I want to.

132
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,834
  It's my house. Name's right
     there on the mortgage.

133
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,702
  Right there on the mailbox.

134
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,237
His name on the mortgage, Donna?

135
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,039
            His name
    on the friggin' mailbox?

136
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,575
       No sir, it is not,
        didn't think so.

137
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,711
        Ipso facto ergo,
     not his Goddamn house.

138
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:27,913
             Jeezo!

139
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,848
   Man you exhaust me, Mitch.

140
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,616
         You know it is
    a dream come true for me

141
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,186
       to have my family
       home on Christmas.

142
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,455
    There's no way they were
   gonna get a motel room now

143
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,723
       at this late date,
    and with Boyd's asthma--

144
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,859
            Asthma?
     Any other restrictions

145
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,427
         Captain Wheezy
      wants to put on me?

146
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,397
 Well, there is one more thing.

147
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,034
I was planning on doing venison
   for Christmas Eve supper,

148
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,670
     but apparently, Boyd's
  family doesn't eat red meat

149
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,737
          and I was--

150
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,340
         Christ's sake!

151
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,725
 Is that all of Douglas' stuff?

152
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,093
     Si. What about Vera's?

153
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,761
            I hid it
    in the car this morning.

154
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,863
        Oh, you're aces!

155
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,764
          Tu tambien!

156
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,766
 So, you ready to see your dad?

157
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,536
     Yeah, can't wait. I'm
actually looking forward to it.

158
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,837
            Really?

159
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,340
       No, I'd rather be
  sodomized by an angry clown!

160
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,476
      I just want the kids
   to have a good Christmas.

161
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,577
            Me, too.

162
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,912
Dad?

163
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,647
  Hey, hi, what are you doing?

164
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,815
       Hi, Dougie doodle.

165
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,750
        Who's gonna feed
     Dale while we're gone?

166
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,785
Oh, that would be--
                         Farhad.

167
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,786
         Who's Farhad?

168
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,888
Mom's ESL student.

169
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,256
          What's ESL?

170
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,291
       Remember, English
     as a second language?

171
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,426
    Why don't you tell him, Dad?
I'll race you upstairs.

172
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,574
     ¶ Jingle bells, jingle
  bells, jingle all the way ¶

173
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:07,112
  ¶ Oh, what fun it is to ride
  in a one-horse open sleigh ¶

174
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,915
  ¶ Dashing through the snow ¶

175
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,317
 ¶ In a one-horse open sleigh ¶

176
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,619
   ¶ O'er the fields we go ¶

177
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,955
    ¶ Laughing all the way ¶

178
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,257
   ¶ Bells on Bobtail ring ¶

179

   ¶ Making spirits bright ¶

180
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,231
                 Son of a bitch.

181
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,832
     Mom, Dad said "bitch."

182
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,569
   Bitch is a bad word, Bug.
  You can use bastard or ass.

183
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,603
Hey, you guys, come on.

184
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,278
       Hey, we're twins!

185
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,448
   Ha ha ha, merry Christmas!

186
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,584
       Licence and proof
     of insurance, please.

187
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,520
            Awesome.

188
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:52,591
   So, I did clock you doing
   67 in a 45, Mr. Mitchler.

189
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,492
       Yeah, the bum deal
         about that is,

190
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:58,496
 it's a 450-dollar infraction,
  but there is some good news.

191
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,566
    You can pay online now,
   in the state of Wisconsin.

192
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,902
    Yeah, it's a real sweet
    website, takes Discover,

193
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:08,807
    so you get the cash back
  which, you know, helps out.

194
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,942
         Alright, kids,
  hope Santa treats you good!

195
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,444
  Take care! Merry Christmas!

196
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,080
Merry Christmas.

197
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,749
You bet.

198
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,822
Oh, where the heck
          can they be?

199
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,890
              Oh, don't get
        your knickers in a knot.

200
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,158
You having a good time, Dad?

201
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,927
         Oh yeah, I'm delirious.

202
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,929
       I want some milk.

203
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,031
  You have to wait 'til supper
   like the rest of us, Cale.

204
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,366
   Where is the sex offender?

205
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,568
He's not a sex offender!

206
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,571
What should I call him
      then, Willy Wanker?

207
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,573
        With the help of
    our marriage counsellor,

208
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,542
    me and Dave have worked
  through his transgressions.

209
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:48,680
      So my husband, Dad,
  is outside smoking a heater.

210
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,328
  Dad, Rance is being a gomer!

211
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,296
Hey you guys, cut it out!

212
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,931
     Where the hell did you
      get that thing from?

213
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,500
           I took it.

214
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,602
   Well, put it the hell back
  from where you took it from!

215
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,409
           Thank you.

216
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,578
           Aw, crud,
    I can't find my camera.

217
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,213
     Mitch, go look for it,
           will you?

218
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,115
       For cripe's sake,
 we're not National Geographic.

219
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,617
        They're not some
       bunch of bonobos.

220
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,353
     Mitch, they have never
    been here for Christmas.

221
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,088
       Well, whose fault
       is that? Not mine.

222
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,656
   Boyd's the one who thinks
     he's too good for us.

223
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,359
     Having my family here
    means everything to me.

224
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,028
 So quit being such an a-hole,

225
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,397
 and go look for my G-D camera!

226
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,502
They're here!

227
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,705
Shut up, tramp stamp!

228
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,076
 Mitch, hurry up, Boyd's here.

229
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,844
             Boyd!

230
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,145
                            Hey!
Oh, honey!

231
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,680
Mom!

232
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,282
I love you.

233
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,517
                I love you.
          It's great to be home.

234
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,653
 You are looking fine as wine.

235
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,456
   Can you believe it, Boyd,
all of us together at Christmas!

236
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,524
      I know, it's great.
     Well, where's the Nel?

237
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,793
      Nelson and the baby
   are meeting us at church.

238
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,028
            Gotcha.

239
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,098
      Isn't this perfect,
     Boyd? This is perfect.

240
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,139
            Stop! Don't hurt me!

241
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,607
        Don't-- don't--

242
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,949
Dad, you okay?

243
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,517
           I'm fine.

244
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,586
You're welcome,
anytime. You're family.

245
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,261
           You okay?

246
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,662
Puba!

247
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,865
         Dougie Doodle!
  How are you, little bugger?

248
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,801
Everybody get together
       for a quick photo,

249
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,270
       and then we gotta
     get ready for church.

250
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,274
 ¶ That glorious song of old ¶

256
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:34,445
  Uh, well, of course most of
  you remember my wife, Cindy,

257
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,948
      and might have known
   that when I was in basic,

258
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,919
   over by Fort Digs, she ran
   off with this Mexican guy,

259
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,822
   who played a little minor
  league ball for the Wombats.

260
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:47,025
       Uh, pretty halfway
       decent shortstop.

261
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,195
  Anyhow, he got her pregnant,
     this Mexican guy did,

262
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,531
       so Cindy comes by
  the house one day, and goes,

263
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,266
          "Hey Nelson,
         would you mind

264
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,569
    "looking after the baby
         for a while?"

265
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,638
          And I said,
  "Yeah, yeah sure, no sweat."

266
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,240
      And anyhow, that was
         six months ago

267
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,642
        and I still got
     this kid of hers, so.

268
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,579
         He don't have
     a name that I know of,

269
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,514
       so I've just been
       calling him Baby.

270
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,517
      But you know, he is
     a real, real good boy.

271
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,987
       And uh, that's why
    I want to name him Boyd,

272
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,455
   after my own big brother,

273
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,758
          who is just
 a heck of a good guy himself.

274
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,595
      So, I am presenting
            Boyd Jr.

275
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:27,799
         as a candidate
       for holy baptism.

276
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,372
        Except I figure
     I'm gonna call him BJ.

277
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,577
   Welcome to the family, BJ.

278
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,280
Dear God,
   I look around this table,

279
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,115
      and I see a family.

280
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,516
   I know we're not perfect,
           Lord God,

281
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,319
    even though some people
        think they are.

282
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:53,191
     We've all got foibles,
   peccadilloes if you will.

283
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,327
I'm not gonna name names, Dave;
it's not the time or the place.

284
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,830
     Anyhow I just want to
  say, thank you, Lord Jesus,

285
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,733
   Lamb of God, for bringing
       us together here.

286
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,434
     And now each one of us
     is gonna say something

287
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,904
     they're thankful for.
         Donna, do it.

288
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,772
            Oh, uh,

289
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:11,476
      I'm thankful little
  BJ's christening went okay.

290
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:16,114
    But mostly I'm thankful
    we're all here together.

291
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,849
     That's a dream for me.

292
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,950
             Skol.

293
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,885
Skol!

294
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,520
      It's a prayer Donna,
     not a toast, come on.

295
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,489
       Shauna, you're up.

296
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,257
      Oh. Uh, I'm grateful

297
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,528
     that through the grace
   of our Lord Jesus Christ,

298
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,997
 I'm able to forgive all of you

299
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,099
        for all the pain
       you've caused me,

300
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,536
     and, thanks to me and
  Dave's marriage counsellor,

301
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,272
        uh, we are back
     on the marriage train,

302
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:45,143
  and we are gonna ride it all
   the way into the station.

303
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,511
             Right?

304
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,614
Well, I got one.

305
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,915
        I thank God that
     he gave me the ability

306
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,784
      to give 110 percent,
         and take first

307
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,352
         for the WISEA
   under-fourteen regionals.

308
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:58,623
   WISEA stands for Wisconsin
Competitive Eating Association.

309
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:03,428
   Rancer ate 27 Johnsonville
     brats in five minutes.

310
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,064
- That's a lot of brats.
- Way to go, Rance.

311
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,902
         That is-- uh,
      that is really neat.

312
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,271
Let's give it the devil, Rancer.
   Come on, pound these back.

313
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,706
Go, Rancer!

314
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,507
Go, go, go, Rancer!

315
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,278
    Get it. Go-o-o, Rancer.
      Go, go, go, Rancer.

316
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:30,054
               ¶

317
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,391
 That's what I'm talking about!
            Come on!

318
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,960
    Wow, that is
really, really neat.

319
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,895
       How many hot dogs
  can you eat, Dougie doodle?

320
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,797
               We're not allowed
                to eat hot dogs.

321
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,733
We're a macrobiotic household.

322
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,801
      For crying out loud,
    Boyd, what's this crap?

323
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,403
  You're gonna turn your kids
   into a couple of beatniks.

324
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,071
       Our kids are fine!

325
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,140
- I know they're fine.
- I'm just saying,

326
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,675
    you don't want your boy
  to turn into a Sally, do ya?

327
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,110
         Don't tell me
     how to raise my kids.

328
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,212
         Don't tell me
    what to do in my house!

329
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,115
 Is your name on the mailbox?!
       I didn't think so!

330
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,950
           Oh really,
  the mailbox line again, Dad?

331
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,786
       Great, you sparked
         Nelson's PTSD.

332
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,156
Post-traumatic
        stress disorder.

333
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:08,726
     When things get tense,
 Nelly gets a little squirrely.

334
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,296
       He has to go into
      a dark, quiet space.

335
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,299
       It's from the war.

336
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,001
         What war, Mom?

337
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,569
         He fell out of
      the back of a Humvee

338
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,937
     during basic training
      and was discharged.

339
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,140
A head injury!

340
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,777
      He got a head injury
      serving his country!

341
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,917
Okay.

342
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,391
          Mmm! What--

343
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,995
     Why are there shotgun
     pellets in my chicken?

344
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,664
Dad.

345
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,001
     Because it's squirrel.

346
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,878
 Honey, no, we're not leaving.

347
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,582
       He fed me a rodent
     for Christmas dinner.

348
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,885
     Well, you're the only
     one who ate squirrel.

349
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,854
    Ours was really chicken.

350
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,355
        You did say that
   you could handle anything

351
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,257
      as long as the kids
 were having a good Christmas,

352
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,827
    and the kids are having
       a great Christmas.

353
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:22,366
    Think you can just flex
    those emotional muscles,

354
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,303
       just a little bit,
     and think of Douglas?

355
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,710
I want some more dessert!

356
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,655
         And that's how
  you make 50 dollars an hour.

357
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,090
                           Puba?

358
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,091
Yeah, Dougie?

359
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,726
        I want us to leave Santa
                a snack,

360
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,262
   but Rance ate all the cookies
        in like, 10 seconds,

361
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,264
            and then he drank
         a whole gallon of milk.

362
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,799
Whoa.

363
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,435
           So, I was wondering
        if you had anything else

364
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,403
     that I could give to Santa?

365
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,608
Of course I do, Bug.

366
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,742
I know something
that Santa loves

367
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,944
      a lot more
than milk and cookies.

368
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,818
   Dear Santa, Puba said you
    would enjoy this bourbon

369
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,754
         and asparagus.
   I hope you like it a lot.

370
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,524
      Love, your very good
   friend, Douglas Mitchler.

371
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:23,227
    ¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
 and let me see what you got ¶

372
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,864
     ¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
  and let me see what you got ¶

373
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,066
    ¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
 and let me see what you got ¶

374
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,003
Whoa, that's pretty neat, Pam.

375
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,138
        I know, I've got
      over 75 hits so far.

376
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,841
   Your average is zero stars
   'cause you suck, turdbait.

377
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,976
       Shut up, jackwipe!

378
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,714
      Hey, that's not very
     Christmassy behaviour.

379
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,183
           Gather up.

380
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,255
    So, we have a tradition
         in our family

381
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,792
         where we read
  <i> The Night Before Christmas</i>

382
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,329
  the night before Christmas.
            Get it?

383
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,965
  This is mentally challenged.

384
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,767
          Do you think
     this is a joke, Rance?

385
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,869
       This isn't a joke.
       This is Christmas.

386
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,871
   We're not two, Uncle Boyd!

387
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,540
        I mean, all this
   Santa crap is for babies!

388
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,509
      Every dumbass knows
     there's no such thing!

389
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,843
            Shut up!

390
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,446
        Shut your mouth!
  Shut your big, eating mouth!

391
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,914
      Right now, shut it!

392
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,421
        Santa will find
      me here, right Dad?

393
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,356
    Of course he will, Bug.

394
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,225
         In fact, Santa
     just texted me to say

395
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,728
        that he made you
      an amazing present!

396
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,798
 But you're gonna have to wait
    until morning to see it.

397
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,903
             Okay.

398
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,572
- Look at this pile of crap.
- This country's so damn excessive

399
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,074
    it makes me wanna puke.

400
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,743
            Oh put a sock in it,
                  Mitchler.

401
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,012
         Well, they're all down.

402
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,280
    Oh that's super, honey.

403
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,282
           Good job.

404
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,619
    Where's Douglas' stuff?

405
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,021
Oh gosh, buried
      in there somewhere.

406
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,730
  Everything's out of the car?

407
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,531
         I got the last
      of it out of there.

408
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,166
    Well, none of it's here.

409
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:14,138
        None of Douglas'
       presents are here.

410
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,812
     No, that's impossible.

411
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,648
    You put them in the car
         this morning.

412
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,116
       I didn't, you did.

413
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,651
 No, you gave me the thumbs up!

414
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,552
       Meaning you do it,
        and you nodded!

415
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,621
 Wait, what are you two saying?

416
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,922
             Boyd--

417
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,457
Not Boyd, Luann!

418
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,560
     Boyd and I left all of
   Douglas' stuff in Chicago.

419
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,362
Oh, jeez.

420
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,299
- It's gonna be fine!
- We'll think of something!

421
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,067
             Right?

422
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:46,570
     Uh, oh I have an idea.
Uh, what's it called, Toys"R"...

423
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,139
Us.

424
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,574
 Babe, the mall closes at six,
           all right?

425
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,109
Just sit there and look pretty.

426
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,312
   Okay, listen, Randy Sickle
   over there in Commercial,

427
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,946
they're open 24 hours,
 we'll go over there,

428
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,315
 pick him up maybe one of
those singing bass plaques

429
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,816
and a mesh hat.

430
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,218
Hey, come on, he's seven. Throw
 in a pack of grape hike shoes

431
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,888
boom,
  it's done. What do you say?

432
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,490
 The kid's never gonna know the
 difference. "Christmas, hey!"

433
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,560
                That's exactly
              what you would do!

434
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,195
    Nice parenting, really nice!

435
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,264
   Last time I checked, it
ain't exactly great parenting

436
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,200
  ruining your kid's
Christmas, Prime Time!

437
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,169
                 I should knock
                you on your ass.

438
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,338
Oh really? Bring it Sally!
 I'd love to see you try!

439
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,539
Come on!

440
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,511
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

441
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,014
Now if we're gonna do this,

442
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,682
        we're gonna need
       some ground rules.

443
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,218
  I'm going. I'm driving back.
       It's not even 11.

444
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,920
   That gives me eight hours
   until he's up. I'm going.

445
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,421
Boyd, don't go!

446
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,490
You can't do it,
         it's too far!

447
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:42,293
He's not going anywhere,
Donna, he's all show and no go.

448
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,766
Boyd. Boyd, stop.

449
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,736
You've had four hours of sleep.
  You're gonna kill yourself!

450
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:54,638
              Any day now,
        Douglas is gonna wake up

451
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,108
           and realize the world
          is a mean, nasty place

452
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,676
     where your hopes and dreams

453
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:01,912
 eventually get smashed to bits.
    Until then, he needs this.

454
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,714
I'm sorry, who needs this?

455
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:08,252
      If I can just make him
 believe for one more Christmas.

456
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,888
    Having Christmas
is not about stuff, Boyd.

457
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,656
 Look, just wait.
Okay, go tomorrow,

458
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,425
when you've had some sleep.

459
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,827
      We'll say that
we delayed Christmas a day.

460
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,096
We'll make it fun.

461
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,400
   I understand. Mitch
ruined Christmas for you,

462
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,903
 but you have proven
a million times over,

463
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,706
    you're not him.
You're such a great dad.

464
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,108
This is just crazy!

465
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,611
Hey, hey.

466
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,013
Look, you're running away
 from your father again!

467
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,915
You can't keep doing this!

468
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,551
- Boyd, wait, I'm coming with you!
- Let me just put up some coffee!

469
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:43,120
           It's about
   an eight-hour round trip,

470
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,223
       which gets me back
    here at what, sevenish,

471
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:50,094
   so just make sure the kids
  stay downstairs until 7:30.

472
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,562
        This is doable,
      but I gotta go now.

473
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,564
Be careful, honey!

474
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,842
        Merry Christmas.

475
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:15,052
               ¶

476
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,104
I made this ornament
     when I was a kid once,

477
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,541
      out of a pine cone.

478
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,777
  It had the googly eyes on it
  and the white cotton deals,

479
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,011
            you know
    what I'm talking about?

480
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,480
         Shut the hell
      up, you degenerate.

481
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,280
            Pervert.

482
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,949
      He's not a pervert!

483
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,751
   A guy who exposes himself
   to a busload of old folks

484
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,153
 on their way to Oneida bingo,

485
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,654
what the hell should I call him
        if not pervert?

486
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,323
        Friggin' pillar
       of the community?

487
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,558
I have explained this situation
    to you a hundred times.

488
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,527
       In Dave's defence,
         he was drunk!

489
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,328
Very!

490
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,829
   And in his second defence,

491
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,765
  someone double-dog dared him
      to do it, so that--

492
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:05,169
   Okay. Who wants to look at
    some slides? Or, I know,

493
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,971
 how about a game of cribbage?

494
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,107
       Oh, I've got that.

495
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,410
             Hello?

496
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,179
- Is it him?
- Is he okay? What happened?

497
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,148
        He's fine, but--
            Aw crud.

498
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,087
            Dammit.

499
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,104
Looky here. BMW.

500
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:43,574
           Short for
     Bavarian Money Waster.

501
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,376
     Looks like the sheisse
       hit the fan here.

502
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,810
I'm gonna hitchhike.
                         Really?

503
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,679
         Christmas Eve,
  no one's gonna pick you up.

504
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:49,813
       Come on, let's go.

505
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:51,382
I'm not giving up.

506
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,183
  You go ahead and go
home. I don't need you.

507
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,319
         Yeah, but Douglas does.

508
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:59,156
              So come on.
       Get in the truck, Gladys.

509
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:03,160
       We got Christmas to save.

510
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,979
        ¶ Silent night ¶

511
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,714
         ¶ Holy night ¶

512
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,090
        ¶ All is calm ¶

513
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,293
       ¶ All is bright ¶

514
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:43,267
      ¶ Round yon virgin ¶

515
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,338
      ¶ Mother and child ¶

516
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,744
        ¶ Holy infant ¶

517
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:57,715
     ¶ So tender and mild ¶

518
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:05,389
  ¶ Sleep in heavenly peace ¶

519
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:11,028
- It don't add up, boy.
- You got a guy tootin' around

520
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,197
    the whole Goddamn planet
         in one night.

521
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:16,800
 That sleigh'd have to be going
   25, 30,000 miles per hour,

522
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,069
    minimum. Now, if we had
 that type of technology, shit,

523
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:23,040
    we'd be blowing the tits
  off the friggin' Viet Kong.

524
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,341
                It's all a sham.

525
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,542
sham.

526
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,478
sham.

527
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,447
what the heck's
      up with that son of a B?

528
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,915
  You know what he is, right?

529
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,717
Sham.
                     Damn right.

530
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,853
        What kind of creep goes
      sneaking into a kid's room

531
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,055
             and putting chump
          change under a pillow?

532
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,491
      What the hell's he need
   all those teeth for? Pervert.

533
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:44,294
              The whole world
          is full of lies, Boyd.

534
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,729
      The only road to happiness

535
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:48,966
    is realizing there's no road
            to happiness.

536
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:51,368
   Alright, I'm going to bed.
 You finish it up on your own.

537
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,906
        Oh yeah, eat me!

538
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,682
          First off--

539
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:09,219
          And second,
  I have asthma, Dad, asthma.

540
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,623
 And it is not
all in my head,

541
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,792
 as you have so astutely
hypothesized in the past.

542
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:17,094
 It is an actual
medical condition

543
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:18,696
that could actually kill me.

544
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:23,300
      So please,
put out the damn cigar.

545
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:26,170
     What the hell's that all
 about? You on the friggin' rag?

546
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,738
                        Come on.

547
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,586
      Come on, lighten up, Boyd.

548
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,055
   We got all night ahead of us.

549
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,926
   Let's have a little fun here.

550
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,001
  I bet they're having a ball.

551
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,570
         Yeah, yippee!

552
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,306
  It does make me feel better
   that Mitch went with him.

553
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:05,109
   Them two hate each
other's guts, I thought.

554
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,178
           Okay, cut it out,
       you guys, we're a family.

555
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,514
       And it's Christmas, jeez.

556
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:13,250
     You know, Mom, I, uh,
don't want to make you feel bad

557
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,019
  with what I'm about to say,
   being that it's Christmas

558
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:19,223
       and all but, a lot
     of this is your fault.

559
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:20,924
Dave and I's marriage counsellor

00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,960
       says that a lot of
    my self-esteem problems

561
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,129
    come from the fact that
    you never confronted Dad

562
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,698
      about his drinking.

563
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,467
  So it's why I seek approval

564
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:33,203
    from people who treat me
       like wet dog crap.

565
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,805
      Who needs anything?

566
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:38,809
      We've got leftovers,
   we've got hot dish. Beer?

567
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:39,977
                        Reeb me!

568
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,513
             That's beer spelled
              backwards, honey.

569
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,722
             Vera.

570
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,925
           Yeah, Bug?

571
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,460
     Was Rance about to say

572
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,295
          that there's
    no such thing as Santa?

573
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,733
      Rance is a certified
        moron, Douglas.

574
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,535
So whatever he was about to say

575
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:07,204
        would have been
       certified moronic.

576
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:09,273
   Of course there's a Santa.

577
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,607
            Promise?

578
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,309
I promise.

579
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,112
   When you see your presents
 under the tree in the morning,

580
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:18,081
you'll believe again, you will.

581
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:21,385
         Now lie down.

582
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,490
             Okay.

583
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,910
       Wow, 53 degrees.
So much for a white Christmas.

584
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,579
             Who needs one?
        Yesterday I was golfing.

585
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,581
           You would have caught
          me in my shirtsleeves.

586
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,983
            Kicked Bill Gorsky's
           ass, the fat pollack.

587
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,953
       I said "if this is global
        warming, I'll take it."

588
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:57,454
      Pollack. Nice, Dad.

589
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,689
      Technically he's a bohunk.

590
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,624
     I got more if you need 'em.

591
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,962
Hi, uh, where's the--

592
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:06,797
     Just past the cheese.

593
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,409
I can guess your nationality
    without even seeing you.

594
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,511
           European.

595
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,580
          You get it?

596
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,148
        You're a-peein'.

597
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,884
               Ha, yeah, got it.

598
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,852
Ho ho ho.

599
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,155
   Hey, you got any bourbon?
            Just a--

600
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,892
      I wish I did, sorry.

601
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,094
   That's okay, that's okay.

602
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:44,468
    So, you having yourself
   a merry little Christmas?

603
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,838
  I wouldn't say that exactly.

604
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,307
Well, nobody said it
    was easy now, did they?

605
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,009
    I mean, take my journey
         here tonight.

606
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,577
      I mean, logic-wise,

607
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,145
 that whole deal doesn't really
        add up, does it?

608
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,914
 I mean my sleigh'd have to be
          doing what,

609
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:01,184
   25, 30,000 miles an hour?
            Minimum?

610
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,525
     But I always make it.
 Somehow I always do, you know.

611
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,093
    I mean, it's not always
       easy, like I say,

612
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,195
    but miracles never are.
 They're tricky little things,

613
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,264
 miracles. Sometimes they look
   at you right in the face.

614
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,999
 They're right in front of you,

615
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,668
 staring at you in the mirror,
 and you didn't even see them.

616
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,803
          It's crazy.

617
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,572
              Um--

618
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,508
          Have a merry
       Christmas, Santa.

619
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,410
I always do, buddy.

620
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:28,612
          I always do.

621
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,983
              Have fun in there.

622
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,484
I'll name it after you.

623
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,019
         Hi, can I get
      a couple of coffees?

624
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:39,056
        That's your old man?
   Virgil Mitch. Ole Mitch, huh?

625
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,424
Yeah, I'm Boyd.

626
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,625
                    You're Boyd!

627
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,527
     Yeah, you're the smart one.

628
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,897
             You got a full ride
                  at the UW.

629
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:49,399
               And now
    you're a stockbroker, is it?

630
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,068
               Down in Chi-town?

631
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,336
I manage a hedge fund.

632
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,071
          Oh yeah, that's right.

633
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:56,907
     But your dad tells me
 you make a truckload of money.

634
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:59,209
    I don't know about that.
        I work too much.

635
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,547
         Well, anyhow, nice
   to have a face with the name.

636
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,483
Your pop, that crazy old
           son of a ,

637
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,119
        he's in here pretty near
              once a week,

638
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,122
             and I get an earful
              about your family.

639
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,256
             Uh-oh.

640
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,858
 No! Mitch talks a blue streak

641
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,594
  about how good you're doing.

642
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:22,866
 Must be nice for y'all to have
 Christmas together, ain't it?

643
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,868
           Uh, it is.

644
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,671
       What do I owe you?

645
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,406
          No, come on.

646
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:32,009
   Merry Christmas now, Boyd.

647
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,011
        Merry Christmas.

648
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,932
        You know how to
    drive a manual, tranny?

649
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,035
You don't remember

650
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,138
           the day you taught me
           how to drive a stick?

651
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,806
Should I?

652
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:06,043
     October 26, 1983, you may
   recall, was my 12th birthday.

653
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,845
          You may also recall
      that you were too hammered

654
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,715
    to drive home from my party,

655
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,884
                so I drove home.

656
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,086
Is that right?

657
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,888
Well, I must have been
doing something right,

658
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,756
'cause you still remember how.

659
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,391
          Yes, it is one of
     life's greatest indignities

660
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:25,328
         that you never won
   the Father of the Year award.

661
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,732
Hey, careful!

662
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,500
   Can't you take a joke, Sally?

663
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:33,236
- Now you're pissing me off.
- Let's just get this done.

664
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,905
Maybe you need to
           piss on the radiator.

665
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,107
Whoa, what was that?

666
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,145
Tit.

667
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,249
Want me to go peek in on BJ?

668
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,517
         No, I'll do it, Shauna.

669
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,352
 Wait a second, where's Nelson?

670
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,021
      Last time I saw him
     he was going ape-crap

671
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,622
         because Mitch
    and Boyd were scrapping.

672
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,157
Well, that was two hours ago.

673
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,093
               Oh shoot, Nelson!

674
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,195
            Nelson!

675
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,798
            Nelson.

676
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,101
     Nelson, baby, come on.

677
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,170
            Nelson.

678
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,842
            Nelson.

679
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,612
         Where are you?

680
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,349
       Oh, he's not where
        he usually goes.

681
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,752
   Whenever he gets panicked
      he just falls asleep

682
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,888
    in the craziest places.

683
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,024
  I found him all balled up in
the middle of the road a coup--

684
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:31,061
           Oh my God.

685
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,964
            Nelson!

686
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,932
      Where are you, baby?
            Wake up!

687
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:36,766
            Nelson!

688
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,235
Nelson!

689
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,370
Nelson! Where are you,
        Nelson? Wake up!

690
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,038
       Donna, be careful!

691
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,273
            Nelson!

692
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,976
            Nelson!

693
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,445
   Oh-- oh, dear Lord Jesus.

694
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,647
¶ Jingle all the way ¶

695
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,450
No, you can't sing low.
                   I know, high.

696
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:54,951
           ¶ Wayyyy ¶

697
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:57,020
    Oh no, stop, stop, stop!

698
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,824
 ¶ Oh what fun it is to ride ¶

699
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,826
Dude, you just hit something.

700
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,395
       ¶ ...open sleigh ¶

701
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,002
          Good night.

702
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,204
Put your hands down
       and let's do this.

703
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,874
     Ahem, I love you ve--
     I love you very much.

704
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,242
              Let's go, come on.
See?

705
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,311
    Mom, has Santa come yet?

706
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:23,914
No honey, not yet,
       it's still early.

707
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,049
       Santa's got a long
      night ahead of him.

708
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,518
      Can Dad tuck me in?

709
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,120
Who? Dad?

710
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:33,757
        No, because, uh,
        Dad and Puba...

711
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,261
     are getting massages.

712
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,731
           Oh, okay.

713
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:42,966
Good night, Mom.

714
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,501
               Okay, good night.

715
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,846
    So who else isn't tired?

716
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,519
        Oh, I forgot to ask you.

717
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,754
           Did Santa Claus
     accost you in the bathroom?

718
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,189
Excuse me?

719
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,457
          You know, the grubby
       old guy in the Santa suit

720
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,292
     in the truck stop bathroom.

721
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,195
I didn't see anybody
  in the bathroom.

722
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,535
   Santa's coming home soon.

723
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:21,771
Gonna bring
       you lots of gifts.

724
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,182
             Oh, son of a bitch!

725
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,316
              Oh!

726
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,018
I forgot to tell you,
the speedometer's off

727
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,319
by about 10 miles an hour.

728
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,521
Oh it's good to know that.

729
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,366
         Well I'll be!

730
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,635
Merry Christmas, Mr. Mitchler!

731
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,169
             Again.

732
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,438
What brings you gents
          out so late?

733
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,807
   Well, numbnuts here forgot
his kid's presents in Chi-town.

734
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,010
         Numbnuts, that's funny.

735
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:04,481
          Haven't heard that one
            in quite some time!

736
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,249
        My foster mom, she, uh--

737
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,219
   Oh, I see you guys are in the
    portable john business, huh?

738
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:11,154
Indeed we are, sir.
  Mitch Mitchler,

739
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,822
North Central Wisconsin
 king of the crappers.

740
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,491
For 25 years,

741
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,092
Mitchler's Handi-crappers have
 been supplying luxury johns

742
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:17,761
for all your business needs.

743
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:20,430
        I always say,
if you gotta go, go in style!

744
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,698
              I like that a lot.

745
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,734
do you guys do family reunions?

746
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,403
                My cousin actu--

747
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:29,572
  We're actually in a really
big hurry, Trooper Zblocki, so.

748
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:30,940
     I could tell, Mr. Mitchler.

749
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,942
             Caught old numbnuts
                here doing 91.

750
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:37,580
              I'll be back
       with your citation, STAT.

751
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,116
Numbnuts.

752
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,987
       Funny little elf.

753
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,962
Well, Mr. Mitchler, I did
      clock you doing 91, yikes!

754
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:55,565
           It's like, "Arriba,
        arriba, andele, andele!"

755
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,468
                   Bart Simpson.

756
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:04,274
      But, it's Christmas,
       so you know what?

757
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:06,943
       I got candy canes
      for you three guys.

758
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,611
Three?

759
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,487
            Nelson?

760
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,889
        Jeez, I must've
      fell asleep in here.

761
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,994
        Who's that guy?

762
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,567
 A child is the most important
  thing a mother has, Nelson.

763
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:34,304
             Jeez, I'm sorry
         I had you worried, Mom.

764
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,573
          If anything
     had happened to you--

765
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,108
           Aw, jeez.

766
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,243
       Mom, could you put
    little BJ on the phone?

767
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,511
  I want to tell him I'm okay.

768
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,913
         He's sleeping
       in his crib, hon.

769
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,583
   Plus he's not even a year.

770
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:49,853
     Well, maybe just go in
 there and tell him I love him?

771
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:54,524
And, uh, could you sing him that
  pretty little song he likes?

772
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,195
        ¶ Hot tortillas,
        crisp tostadas ¶

773
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:02,332
      ¶ Best in Me-hi-co ¶

774
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:06,636
   ¶ Enchiladas, empanadas ¶

775
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:11,074
     ¶ How I love them so ¶

776
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,546
It is a miracle
   that you got pulled over,

777
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:19,349
   because I could have froze
  to death in there, or worse.

778
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,217
  Not cold enough
to freeze to death.

779
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,186
          Okay, real quick,
    what could possibly be worse

780
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,355
       than freezing to death
   in a portable toilet, Nelson?

781
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:29,692
     HIV, AIDS, Lou Gehrig
disease, cancer, spina bifida...

782
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,061
            Okay, all good ones.

783
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,097
  I could think of one worse.

784
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,632
    A guy getting his gonads
     lobbed off by his wife

785
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:38,835
     because he forgot his
   kid's Christmas presents.

786
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,315
Get 'im!

787
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,683
I'm not supposed to
              play video games,

788
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,585
            but you're really
         awesome at them, Rance.

789
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:56,953
Yeah, I know.

790
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,055
   We should totally put your
  picture on Craigslist, Vera.

791
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,958
         Your judgement
  is really questionable, Pam.

792
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,101
       You gonna stay up
         with us, Dave?

793
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,270
         Oh no, I, uh--
     I get hungry at night

794
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,206
so I like to make myself a meal
   so I have something to eat

795
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,408
  between sleep and breakfast.

796
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,742
        I call it breep.

797
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,311
       Okay.

798
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,812
     It's an anagram I came
   up with, much like brunch

799
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,683
   or NASA. It's a way for me
    to remember what I like.

800
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,688
  Hon, let's go hit the sack.

801
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,357
                     Good night.
Night.

802
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,492
             Night.

803
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,360
           Oh, Daver.

804
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,662
                           Oooh!

805
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,764
        You are too good for me.

806
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,177
   You know, maybe I will try

807
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,778
          one of those
  beer-tomato-juice thingies.

808
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,482
    Well now you're talking.
 One red beer coming right up.

809
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,523
Holy cripes, it's a castle.

810
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,393
           You really
    are doing alright, Boyd.

811
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,969
You've never seen
              this house before?

812
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,238
  No, your mom has.
Last time I was here,

813
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,741
     you had that apartment
          by the lake.

814
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:27,143
It's going on seven years.

815
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,079
             What's this you got
              on the walls here?

816
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,548
         Is that brick?

817
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,750
          Yeah, it's--
    uh, it's a brick house.

818
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,389
    Boy, that is something.

819
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,590
             Yeah.

820
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,971
        Son of a bitch!

821
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:57,040
      I left my damn keys
        in my damn car!

822
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,450
        Hey Hamburglar,
        will this help?

823
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,428
          The presents
   are in the mudroom, so...

824
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,330
       Hey Boyd, I gotta
         take a squirt.

825
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:23,099
 You guys have a bathroom, or--

826
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,134
Yeah, it's upstairs.

827
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:26,869
  Make yourself at home, Dad.

828
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,871
Yeah.

829
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,871
              Dad?

830
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,873
            Nelson?

831
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,665
        What's going on?

832
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,800
What are you doing in my house?

833
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,736
          I am Farhad.

834
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:37,240
Who are these people?

835
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:40,476
      Ms. Mitchler is say,

836
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:44,781
 my family to sit in the house,

837
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,251
         to feed dog--

838
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:50,553
        there, the dog.

839
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,890
      To sit in the house.

840
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:58,461
   House-sitting is different
   than sitting in my house!

841
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,932
Ah, it's Boyd.

842
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,901
Hi, is everything okay?

843
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:07,236
<i>- Fine, okay.</i>
<i>- Farhad is here.</i>

844
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,906
    Yeah, I gave him the key
     so he could feed Dale.

845
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:10,973
         You knew that.

846
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,709
    No, but his whole family
            is here.

847
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:15,912
      It's like Goldilocks
      and the 30 Iranians.

848
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,648
Boyd, they're from Afghanistan.

849
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,916
          I don't care
      where they're from,

850
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,051
    I care why they're here,
          in my house!

851
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,319
 Ooo, maybe there was confusion

852
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:24,821
      over the translation
         of house-sit.

853
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:26,889
           <i> You know,</i>
  <i> they're an amazing family.</i>

854
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,292
       They've only been
   in the country two months,

855
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:32,061
     so, whatever, let them
     have a nice Christmas.

856
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,696
 <i> You're not saving the world!</i>

857
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:36,199
What do you think, you're, uh--
     you think you're Bono?

858
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:37,734
      I have a law degree!
         I'm a teacher!

859
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:40,036
     You're supposed to be
   teaching refugees English,

860
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,637
         and based upon
 my conversation with this guy,

861
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,706
        it's not exactly
      working out, is it?!

862
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,675
          If anyone's
      to blame, it's you!

863
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:47,977
  You for being an ass sponge!

864
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:49,312
      I'm the ass sponge?

865
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:51,581
          Yes, you are
  the ass sponge, ass sponge.

866
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,782
         I'm not having
       this conversation.

867
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,317
        I am not having
       this conversation.

868
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,585
             Fine.

869
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,988
           Oh my God!
   He acts like the sweetest,

870
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,391
  nothing-bothers-me guy, but
 the slightest little pressure

871
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:04,694
    turns him into a total--

872
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:05,928
                     Ass sponge?

873
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,098
                 He sounds
           just like his father.

874
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,667
         You know, in case those
         guys don't make it back

875
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:13,469
                in time somehow,

876
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,639
        maybe we oughtta have
     something else for Douglas.

877
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:17,673
Like what?

878
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,742
               Maybe we oughtta
              go up to the attic

879
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:22,779
          and wrap some old toys
         and that, just in case.

880
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:26,182
Yeah, okay fine.

881
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:28,151
Donna, do you have
  something else

882
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:31,687
        that maybe
doesn't taste like-- this?

883
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,156
             Vodka?

884
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:35,892
Hey Doug-lass, you wanna
   do something really cool?

885
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:37,693
              Yes!

886
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:39,128
                          Sweet.

887
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,130
       You know, I wasn't
      a competitive eater

888
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,498
     'til I was like, nine.

889
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,000
    If I would have started
           at seven,

890
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,803
    who knows how much more
    friggin' awesome I'd be?

891
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,572
   Ah, let's see how fast you
 can take these bad boys down.

892
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,307
    A whole jar of pickles?

893
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,509
             Do it.

894
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,580
Please don't,
     Douglas, it's stupid.

895
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:59,048
   You'll be sick for Santa!

896
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,983
You want to be cool
          or retarded?

897
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,152
     Man or mouse, Douglas?

898
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,024
Yes! Oh my God! Look at him go!

899
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,231
       Chug, chug, chug,
    chug, chug, chug, chug!

900
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,799
         Douglas, stop!

901
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,302
   These pickles were canned
during the Nixon Administration!

902
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:22,138
       You're gonna die!

903
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,340
     I can't feel my legs.

904
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,022
         What the hell?

905
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:50,032
               ¶

906
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,906
         He erased me.

907
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,643
       Ain't that a kick
         in the pants?

908
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,015
        Presents. Gifts.

909
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,049
           Ho ho ho?

910
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,085
             Gift?

911
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,320
        Gift, yes, yes.

912
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,322
           Thank you.

913
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,224
No, Farhad.

914
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,927
   Those are Douglas' gifts!

915
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,429
        My son! Douglas.

916
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,164
         No Farhad son!

917
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:24,400
      No! My son's gifts!

918
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,003
        Girls, those are
        my power tools!

919
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,538
   That's Boyd's power drill
       and that is very--

920
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,008
          Ahhh! Jesus!

921
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,877
           Hey, Boyd.
     These your roommates?

922
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,647
    Hey Boyd, you got a nail
sticking out of your hand there.

923
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,356
 Oh, we've been learning Nari,
  which is kind of like Farsi,

924
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,158
         over at basic
    because my reserve unit

925
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,260
   was going to be going over
        by Afghanistan--

926
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,762
Oh!

927
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:53,996
         And I fell off
        of that Humvee,

928
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:56,532
     and I got just a touch
        of brain damage.

929
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:59,635
  But the part that remembers
       Nari is just fine.

930
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:04,273
      So, can you tell him
   that his family can stay?

931
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,542
  I just need Douglas' gifts.

932
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,744
 Well, I can sure as shoot try.

933
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,548
        Let's see, uh...

934
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,989
- Please, no, no.
- No, no, no, please!

935
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,925
           Hey, hey.

936
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:26,262
      Hey, hey, it's okay.
    You can keep everything.

937
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:28,230
     The only thing I want

938
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:30,032
            is that.

939
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:40,042
               ¶

940
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,092
      Hey, it's, uh, 3:45,
so we have less than four hours

941
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,427
    if we're gonna get back
    before the kids get up.

942
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,629
   So I need you to motivate.

943
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,266
       You don't need me;
         you never did.

944
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,448
It's all gonna be okay, Bug.

945
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,984
Boing!

946
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:24,620
It's okay, Bug.

947
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,455
      Boing, hello Rance!

948
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,858
      They told me there'd
   always be people like you.

949
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,293
         I don't know,
    I've never seen anybody

950
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,695
     this way from pickles!

951
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,297
     Rotten food can cause
     hallucination, Rance.

952
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:36,966
Everybody knows that, you dummy.

953
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:39,235
      It's gonna be okay,
      Bug, just lie down.

954
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,810
         Mmmm, cheese.

955
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,947
  How about this for Douglas?

956
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,553
  Bridge, like the card game?

957
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,021
           For kids?

958
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:01,057
         I don't know,
 it seems like a horrible idea.

959
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:04,460
 Boyd loved bridge for juniors,
   it was his favourite game!

960
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:06,328
            He did?

961
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,631
    Okay, bag it and tag it,
            I guess.

962
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,769
        That was Mitch's
        drink of choice.

963
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,438
   Vodka and cranberry juice.

964
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,773
   It must have been so hard.

965
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:20,176
         I don't know.

966
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:23,512
     I left a couple times
     when it got too hard.

967
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,147
         Took the kids
          to my folks,

968
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:28,651
      then when his bender
         was finished,

969
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:30,486
     he'd call bellyaching,

970
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:34,490
     "Come back, come back.
   I'll change, I'll change,"

971
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:36,192
     blah, blah, you know.

972
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,597
        He was always...

973
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,266
    a very attentive lover,
            though.

974
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,669
    If you know what I mean?

975
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:49,004
I do. Yes, wow.

976
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,309
   Boyd and I haven't had sex
        for six months.

977
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:55,744
            Oh, wow.

978
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,246
      That is bad for you.

979
00:51:57,248 --> 00:52:00,249
          It's so bad.
      It's just, you know,

980
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,751
     he works all the time,
     and-- or we're tired,

981
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,854
     or the kids are around
    and you know, it just...

982
00:52:04,856 --> 00:52:06,589
        But then he has
        this whole thing

983
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:08,858
 about how everything has to be
  so perfect, and it can't be.

984
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,192
  It's not. It's not perfect.

985
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:13,095
         Do you want me
    to talk to him for you?

986
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,698
  No, that's okay, thank you.

987
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,700
        That would feel
    a little inappropriate.

988
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:22,505
              Yep.

989
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:24,707
             What?

990
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:34,817
¶  ¶

991
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,158
       <i> ¶ Two days later,</i>
      <i> Papa passed away ¶</i>

994
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:50,266
               ¶

995
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,344
            I packed
    my grandmother's trunk,

996
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,747
   and in it I put an apple.

997
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,148
                           Nice.

998
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,284
            God, we used to play
            that when we'd drive

999
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:10,386
            to Nana's cottage
         up north, you remember?

1000
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:11,887
Mm-hm.

1001
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:14,857
              Okay, I packed
          my grandmother's trunk

1002
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:18,360
             and in it I put
         an apple and a bagpipe.

1003
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,763
           Nice one.
      Okay Dad, you're up.

1004
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,366
            Dad, it's your turn.

1005
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:27,570
                Come on Dad,
           it's been a crap day.

1006
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:30,406
  Everything that possibly could
       go wrong already has.

1007
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,844
  What, you on the rag, Sally?

1008
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,517
  I packed my grandma's trunk,
   and in it I put an apple,

1009
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:44,353
            bagpipe,

1010
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:46,922
           and a kid
who's so ashamed of his old man,

1011
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,124
           he cut him
     out of a family photo.

1012
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,895
    Okay, so you're spelling
       kid with a C then.

1013
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,530
        Uh, fair enough.

1014
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:56,732
 I don't know what to say, Dad.

1015
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:02,271
  Fine, as long as we're being
    honest with each other,

1016
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:06,175
     yes, I was embarrassed
   of you in that photograph.

1017
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:08,944
  You were wearing that filthy
     Handi-crapper T-shirt

1018
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:11,981
     for a family portrait.
        I mean come on!

1019
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,383
What, you're suddenly sensitive?

1020
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,789
     Besides, it's not like
   you were ever proud of me.

1021
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,258
    I always supported you,

1022
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,860
        whatever it was
   you wanted to do, always!

1023
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:27,396
                   Are you high?

1024
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,466
What is that?

1025
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:35,437
Oh my gosh!

1026
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,439
                           Hoho!

1027
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,780
           Is that--

1028
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,449
    Bea Arthur? It sure is.

1029
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,784
              Why?

1030
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,119
   Boyd went through a phase

1031
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,721
        where he really
      got into Bea Arthur.

1032
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,723
 Like is-- like sexually? Or--

1033
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,459
              No!
 It started with<i> Golden Girls.</i>

1034
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,963
     Wait, he liked bridge
       and<i> Golden Girls?</i>

1035
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,931
      What did you raise,
      a 75-year-old woman?

1036
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:05,034
 Look, there's a whole series.

1037
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:09,271
  You know how what's-his-futz
    just painted blue stuff?

1038
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:11,907
        Well, Boyd only
      painted Bea Arthur.

1039
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,143
       This is so silly.

1040
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:16,445
       My Boyd who played
    football and basketball,

1041
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:19,148
         who's a type-A
      hedge fund manager?

1042
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,449
            No, no!

1043
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:23,052
     He was real arty-farty
  when he was a little shaver.

1044
00:55:23,054 --> 00:55:25,821
           Well Mitch
     must have loved that.

1045
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,856
       Mitch, he used to
    tease Boyd all the time.

1046
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,191
   I felt terrible about it.

1047
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:31,994
        He drilled legs
  into the frame of this one.

1048
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,363
He turned it into a card table.

1049
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:37,299
  He used to play euchre on it
   with his drinking buddies.

1050
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:40,703
    Look, there's the rings
        from the glasses

1051
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,438
     on the canvas, there.

1052
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,840
    And I think Bill Gorsky
       puked on it here.

1053
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,142
        That is so mean.

1054
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:49,044
      Isn't that so mean?

1055
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,713
    Lookit, that is so mean!

1056
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:53,649
      He was just a little
   artist, creating his art,

1057
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:56,185
      and that's-- I mean,
   it just makes me very sad,

1058
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:57,486
       isn't that so sad?

1059
00:55:57,488 --> 00:56:00,956
       Boyd never really
    painted much after that.

1060
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,524
      Mitch is a bastard!

1061
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,226
   And I have been trying to
  get those guys to reconcile,

1062
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,628
     but do you understand
  how much Boyd hates his job?

1063
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,931
      He hates it so much,
    and all he wanted to do

1064
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:11,600
     was be a sweet little
      Bea Arthur painter!

1065
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:13,936
         Or something.

1066
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,338
 I just feel like I could puke.

1067
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,340
It blows my mind.

1068
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:22,077
        You have the capacity to
        feel sorry for yourself!

1069
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,645
             Oh, what a jackass.

1070
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:26,181
  If I loused up so bad, how
come you have such a nice life?

1071
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,717
    Nice house,
nice wife, nice job.

1072
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,219
                  I hate my job!

1073
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,488
        And I haven't had sex
     with my wife in six months!

1074
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,757
   And you blame that on me?
        Jiminy crickets!

1075
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:36,392
      Jeez, come on, guys!

1076
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,694
   I'm sorry I didn't snuggle
     or cuddle you enough!

1077
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,796
   I'm sorry I'm not perfect!

1078
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:41,997
                        Perfect?

1079
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,266
              My entire approach
                 to parenting

1080
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:48,804
         is based on what I call
           the WWMD principle.

1081
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:51,240
         What Would Mitch Do?
     I ask myself that question,

1082
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:54,176
                and then I do
             the exact opposite.

1083
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,678
    Come on Boyd, you know I
 get jittery 'cause of the war!

1084
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,147
           You didn't go to war!

1085
00:56:58,149 --> 00:57:00,048
He's still a hero!
He's still a hero!

1086
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,587
        Son of a bitch!

1087
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,190
      No, no, no, no, no!

1088
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,794
      No, Boyd, slow down!

1089
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:13,262
We can do it.

1090
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:14,997
    Not sure if you can see
  me back here, Mr. Mitchler--

1091
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,934
           See that?
            See it!

1092
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,703
      Come on, Boyd,
you're gonna get us killed!

1093
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,138
        Pull over, Boyd!

1094
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,907
    My whole life I've never
     been your kind of man,

1095
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,776
    a man's man, a real man.

1096
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:31,380
Well, let's see who the real man
        is now! Hold on!

1097
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,360
        Shut up, Sally.
 You sound like a little bitch.

1098
00:57:56,673 --> 00:58:01,143
  Yeah, suck on that, Zblocki!
  Suck on that! Eat it, bitch!

1099
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,512
                       Yes, yes!

1100
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:04,980
<i> Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1101
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,249
           Uh, yeah.

1102
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:09,985
      Umm, I'm out at uh--

1103
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,688
      Mr. Mitchler, he...

1104
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,057
<i> , everything okay?</i>

1105
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,494
           Eff this.

1106
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,863
    Just wanted to wish you
    a merry Christmas, Don!

1107
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:23,932
    I'm calling her a night.
  Gonna head home to the fam.

1108
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:26,134
<i> Roger that.</i>

1109
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,343
    Oh God, that felt good!

1110
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,546
   You're not this guy, Boyd.

1111
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:40,082
  You're not some idiot who'd
 run away from a cop like that.

1112
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:43,018
    Hell, that's the kind of
  asshole stunt that I'd pull.

1113
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,220
            You got
    the asshole part right.

1114
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:52,528
 Maybe you're right about that.

1115
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,770
  This has been a weird night.

1116
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,574
           I'm sorry.

1117
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:10,312
   I'm sorry to both of you.

1118
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:12,180
       Mainly you, Boyd.

1119
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,250
           I'm sorry.

1120
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:17,953
        Suppose I might
      have said it sooner

1121
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:20,255
  if I hadn't been so hammered
 for most of the last 30 years

1122
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:22,224
         but you know?

1123
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,626
There it is, I said it.

1124
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,567
       You're a good man

1125
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:35,003
            and uh,

1126
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:37,739
         I'm so sorry.

1127
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:46,281
               ¶

1128
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,550
I'm sorry, oh!

1129
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,819
What the hell was that?!

1130
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:52,621
      Did we hit somebody?

1131
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:55,724
I'm telling you, Boyd,
       that was a person!

1132
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:58,493
Nelson, it wasn't a person.

1133
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:00,095
  It can't have been a person.

1134
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,631
  What would a person be doing
  in the middle of the road--

1135
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:05,067
Maybe it was a deer.
            Yeah, it was a deer!

1136
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:06,368
It wasn't a deer.

1137
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:08,570
     Yes, of course it was a d--

1138
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,774
                          Oh no.

1139
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:21,783
               ¶

1140
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,426
Oh God, oh my God, oh my God!

1141
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,996
           What are we gonna do?
           What are we gonna do?

1142
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:35,664
  Okay, Boyd, just calm down.

1143
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:39,801
          Calm?! Calm?
      I just killed a man!

1144
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,737
This is not the time to be calm!

1145
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,605
        We just gotta--
  we just gotta call the cops.

1146
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:45,540
    No, we're not gonna call the
   cops! I just outran the cops!

1147
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:47,542
               The last thing
           we need are the cops!

1148
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:49,811
Boyd's right, no cops.
                My life is over!

1149
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,279
          No it isn't!

1150
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,315
    I'm gonna go to prison.
      I'm going to prison.

1151
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,084
Boyd, just glass-half-full
 it for a sec here, okay?

1152
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,320
Prison these days
is not half bad.

1153
01:00:58,322 --> 01:00:59,988
      I'll take the heat!

1154
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,857
      I mean, come on now,
    it's the least I can do,

1155
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,825
   you know, being shitfaced
    and emotionally abusive

1156
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,127
    most of your childhood.

1157
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,395
          No, Dad, no.

1158
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:09,097
    No, no, no, no, no, no!

1159
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:11,900
       Boyd, Boyd, Boyd!

1160
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:13,869
There's other ways out of this.

1161
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:15,103
              How?

1162
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,072
         This guy, uh--

1163
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:18,607
       We're not exactly
        talking doctor,

1164
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,409
            lawyer,
   Indian chief here, right?

1165
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,845
       He's off the grid.

1166
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,348
   So if he umm, disappeared.

1167
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,518
I got this friend, Mike Marcort.

1168
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,087
  You know, we play cribbage,
         and he owes me

1169
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:34,990
  and uh, he's got a warehouse
     down by Campbell Sport

1170
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:37,159
          full of HCl.

1171
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:38,560
         HC what, Dad?

1172
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:41,263
       Hydrochloric acid.
            And so?

1173
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:42,764
  Well, you know, I'm saying--

1174
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:44,499
    not that he doesn't have
      value in God's eyes;

1175
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:46,768
  I'm just saying that we soak
    this guy in a vat of HCl

1176
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:47,936
     for a couple of hours?

1177
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:50,305
      This son of a bitch
     will just fizzle away.

1178
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,673
Wait a minute.

1179
01:01:51,675 --> 01:01:53,809
  We're not really
thinking about this?

1180
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,344
                He's right, Dad.

1181
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:58,547
                 Nelson's right.

1182
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:04,553
           We don't have time
        to go to Campbell Sport.

1183
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,755
  You're right, it's too far.
      What was I thinking?

1184
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,425
   Dad, do you have a shovel?

1185
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,627
  Does Flipper pee in the sea?
          I got that!

1186
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:14,162
No, no, guys--

1187
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,764
       Well, do you have
         a better idea?

1188
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:17,466
        Do you? Because
      I'd love to hear it.

1189
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:19,334
     No, but have you ever
  dug a foxhole before, Boyd?

1190
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:22,204
     Because I have and it
    takes a super long time!

1191
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:23,238
        Oh, he's right!

1192
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,440
        Nelson's right.

1193
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:31,146
  We could-- we can burn him.

1194
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:33,482
     You know, like a fire.

1195
01:02:33,484 --> 01:02:36,551
      Burning could work,
        burning's good!

1196
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:38,220
       That's good, Nel--

1197
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:40,255
           What's going on, Dad?

1198
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,590
    If we're gonna burn him,
  it's a hell of a lot easier

1199
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,792
     if you parcel him out.

1200
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,676
      You got any bourbon?

1201
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,350
Hey, Doug!

1202
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:10,085
         Dougie doodle.

1203
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:11,253
         Who said that?

1204
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:15,857
             Bingo.

1205
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:17,025
         You can talk?

1206
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,794
         You're seeing
    my lips move, ain't ya?

1207
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:21,363
Well then, that would constitute
     talking, wouldn't it?

1208
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:22,864
        Is this a dream?

1209
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:26,301
   "Is this a dream?" Maybe,
      maybe it's a dream,

1210
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,036
or maybe I'm your subconscious,

1211
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:30,305
       secretly trying to
     unearth truth for you

1212
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,641
          in the form
   of a waking hallucination.

1213
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,643
      Listen Doug, let me
       get to the gristle

1214
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:36,878
      of why I woke you up
    here. It breaks my heart

1215
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,949
     to tell you this, but
  Santa ain't gonna find you,

1216
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:43,752
    not here, not anywhere.

1217
01:03:43,754 --> 01:03:44,653
            Why not?

1218
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:47,856
   Because he doesn't exist.

1219
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:52,127
        Yeah, don't take
       it so hard, buddy.

1220
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:55,096
 As you get older, you'll learn
  there are much worse things

1221
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:56,598
       you could be told

1222
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,668
       than some fat guy
  in a red suit doesn't exist.

1223
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,504
         Alright then,
       sleep tight, kid.

1224
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:05,974
  And oh uh, Merry Christmas.

1225
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,414
        Radiator's shot.

1226
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,385
Who ya calling there, Boyd?

1227
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:18,687
                          Luann.

1228
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:20,522
              Let her know
        we're not gonna make it.

1229
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,190
Not gonna make it?

1230
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,092
Hold on a sec, Boyd.

1231
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:27,696
   Hey look, I know that
we have been through a lot,

1232
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:30,599
well, me getting stuck
     in the john

1233
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:32,968
and you getting pegged with
  a nail gun by some kid,

1234
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,269
and running from that cop,

1235
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,470
and trying to figure out
     different ways

1236
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:38,073
to dismember a transient,

1237
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:41,910
but it's Christmas,
and if we quit now,

1238
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:44,846
it's like the baby Jesus died
up on that cross for nothing.

1239
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:46,982
            I think
    that's Easter, actually.

1240
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:49,684
       Yeah, yeah, yeah,
  you're right, you're right.

1241
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:52,787
     My point is, you know,
  I suppose I don't know much

1242
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:55,924
   about being a father yet,
  since BJ's only been around

1243
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:58,026
       a couple of months
      and he's technically

1244
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:01,396
     some Mexican's, on top
     of that but, you know,

1245
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:05,000
what I seen you do today, Boyd--
  go to the ends of the earth

1246
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:06,601
    for your son like that--

1247
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:09,871
    jeez, that's what being
     a father's all about.

1248
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:13,074
     And I just don't think
      you should quit now.

1249
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:15,844
      There's still time.

1250
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:34,696
  Hey, uh, I'm really sorry we
 almost killed you back there.

1251
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,734
    I don't suppose you have
   a vehicle we could borrow?

1252
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:41,636
       'Cause we're about
      10 miles from where

1253
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:44,539
       we're supposed to
       be here, and um--

1254
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:49,077
     I don't know how else
     to put this, except...

1255
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:52,013
        we're hoping for
 a friggin' Christmas miracle.

1256
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:03,425
¶ Fall on your knees ¶

1257
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:06,494
     ¶ Oh, hear the radiant
        voices calling ¶

1258
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:09,531
              ¶ Oh God, oh God ¶
¶ Boom, boom, boom ¶

1259
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,670
           Oh, shoot!
      Luann, are you okay?

1260
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:17,872
      I'm okay, I'm okay.

1261
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,916
             Yeah!

1262
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,986
   Come on you guys, wake up!

1263
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:32,988
          Let's go up
     and see if Santa came.

1264
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:45,000
               ¶

1265
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,945
  They're breathing. Come on!

1266
01:06:56,947 --> 01:07:06,955
               ¶

1267
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,194
Come on, whoa, whoa!

1268
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,600
 See, I told you Santa's real!
   Now we can find our stuff.

1269
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,706
Pull up there, there!

1270
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,908
          What do you
      think you got, Bug?

1271
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:30,812
 I don't think I got anything.

1272
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,153
   We can't thank you enough.

1273
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:40,388
Merry Christmas,
      it's been a flight!

1274
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:49,297
               ¶

1275
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:52,834
Where you goin', they're up?

1276
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:54,836
     Yeah. He's up. All the kids
         have their presents.

1277
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:56,237
    So what, go on in there
    and give him the thing!

1278
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,640
           He'll know
     there's no Santa, Dad!

1279
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:13,154
 Maybe Santa took your presents
    to the wrong house, or--

1280
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:14,622
              No.

1281
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:16,124
       There is no Santa.

1282
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:19,160
             Look.
  Puba said he loved bourbon.

1283
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,279
        Merry Christmas.

1284
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,204
           Good luck.

1285
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,440
              Oh!

1286
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:06,741
       No Douglas, don't!

1287
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,690
      You must be Douglas.

1288
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:24,292
         Are you Santa?

1289
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:26,794
   Oh, yes indeed. Yes, I am.

1290
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:28,997
        Why'd you drink
    all that bourbon, Santa?

1291
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:30,398
    Won't it make you drunk?

1292
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,402
         Well, Douglas,
 bourbon gives Santa the energy

1293
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:38,139
     that he needs to keep
     his appointed rounds.

1294
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:41,609
         And asparagus.
       Puba told me that.

1295
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:44,779
      Yep, asparagus, too.

1296
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,814
          Smart fella.

1297
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:48,883
        Oh my goodness,

1298
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,818
 I almost forgot your present.

1299
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:54,522
   Merry Christmas, Douglas.

1300
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,058
       Thank you, Santa.

1301
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,393
           I believe.

1302
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,163
   And I hope you always do.

1303
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:07,001
        Santa, don't you
      want your asparagus?

1304
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:09,604
          That's okay,
     Douglas, you keep it.

1305
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:11,806
        Asparagus makes
     my urine smell funny.

1306
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,043
        Merry Christmas.

1307
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,451
 I think it was a big success.

1308
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,655
       On second thought

1309
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:29,857
     this may have not been
        such a hot idea.

1310
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:36,598
    No matter how this pans
   out, you tried your best.

1311
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,767
    Bottom line, you're one
   hell of a good dad, Boyd.

1312
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,805
          Thanks, Dad.

1313
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,415
     Merry Christmas, Bug.

1314
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,019
       Dad, why did your
     massage take so long?

1315
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:01,422
        Let me help you.

1316
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,561
- Nice wrap job there.
- What is it?

1317
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:07,996
What do you say?

1318
01:11:07,998 --> 01:11:09,364
I built it, the whole thing.

1319
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:11,199
                I even sanded
             the runners myself.

1320
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:13,668
It's really something.

1321
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,870
Really something.

1322
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,774
     Wow, it's pretty cool, huh?

1323
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,976
    Hmm, neat, but no snow.

1324
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,645
 Let's see what else there is.

1325
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,413
Uh, hey Bug!

1326
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:27,815
           Uh, look,
 I found this outside for you.

1327
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:29,784
  Santa must have dropped it.

1328
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,129
      Bridge for juniors!

1329
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:44,299
     I've always wanted to
   learn how to play bridge!

1330
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:46,200
       Woo-hoo, alright!

1331
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:47,935
   Neato, look at what I got!

1332
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:53,708
           I'm sorry.

1333
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,810
           I'm drunk.

1334
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,713
        I remain sorry.

1335
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:00,915
   And I accept your apology.

1336
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,621
      Oh for cripe's sake,
    Boyd, get a Goddamn room

1337
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,156
 if you're gonna be doing that.

1338
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:09,791
     Dave's the designated
    pervert in this family.

1339
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:11,993
      He's not a pervert!

1340
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,380
Hey, hey!

1341
01:12:32,382 --> 01:12:34,382
Rancer!

1342
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,754
               You think I would
              have known better.

1343
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:41,456
Oh, I suppose.

1344
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,324
But if we always learned
   from our mistakes,

1345
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,526
    nobody'd ever spend
Christmas with their family.

1346
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,364
What the hell good is getting
   a sled in this day and age

1347
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:52,066
 of global warming? You should
    have got the kid a boat.

1348
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:55,269
                   Shut up, Dad.

1349
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:57,538
     Dad, can we go inside
   and play some bridge now?

1350
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:07,548
               ¶

1351
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:25,099
    Look Dad, it's snowing!

1352
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:27,635
       You're right, Bug.

1353
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,637
Probably ash.
