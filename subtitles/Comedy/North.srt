Holy mackerel!
Your folks are sitting on a goldmine.

162
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,519
Tell me about it.

163
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,839
You realise, of course,
that you're not alone.

164
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,319
What do you mean?

165
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
Look, kid,
just because I'm in a bunny suit

166
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,599
doesn't mean I haven't stumbled
across a basic truth now and then.

167
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,599
The feeling
of being insufficiently appreciated

168
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,279
is a common childhood lament.

169
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,279
I'm not common!
Of course you're not.

170
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,599
But I bet
that even Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

171
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,239
who wrote a symphony
by the age of three,

172
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,239
had more than a few evenings then

173
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,439
with an angry parent yelling,
“Stop banging on that damn piano

174
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,119
"“and go to bed, Mozart!"

175
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,599
Yeah, fine!

176
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,599
But Mr Mozart's dead and I'm alive.

177
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,239
So I'll bet right now I'm in more pain
than he is.

178
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,242
Hard to argue with that one.

179
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,239
At this point, I'd even settle
for Mozart's parents.

180
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,239
Well, unfortunately,
you don't get to make that choice, kid.

181
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,919
The one thing that we cannot control
in this life is who our parents are.

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,279
You're dealt the hand,
you're stuck with it.

183
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,599
It's not like baseball
where if you don't like one team,

184
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,919
you become a free agent
and get a better deal elsewhere.

185

not because you're editor
of the school newspaper.

Alright, alright! I'll hold the story.

Now, then, let me remind you
this is a trial, this is not a hearing.

324
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,759
Even though both sides
will be saying things I will hear,

325
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,759
it is still not a hearing.

then it's my job to pass judgment.

Obviously, you can all pass judgment
too, but it won't count.

Have I made myself clear
to the plaintiff?

Yes, Your Honour.
It is quite clear to the plaintiff.

he has the option of returning
to his original parents.

After 35 years of statehood,

630

people still don't treat Hawaii
like we're part of the country.

Sure, there's a star on the flag,

632

but why didn't anyone show up
during Hands Across America?

633
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,119
We waited for days, and not even
a call to say nobody was coming.

634

It's just plain inconsiderate.
He's right.

635

People from the mainland
just don't care about Hawaii.

636
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,919
They come here with their knobby knees
and their pale kids,

637
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,319
and they eat our food
and watch our whales

638
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,479
and say 'Aloha!', like they really mean it.

639
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,759
7-10 days later they drop us like
a sack of rancid poi and go home!

about ourselves?

have to do with my crack?!

Oh, don't you see, North,
if you lived here in Hawaii,

643
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,719

more inclined to settle here.

you add an hour to your life.

He's very sensitive.

Well, I mean...

1244
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,719
And what do they mean
by give us one more chance?

1245
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,479
I thought they didn't love me.
What are you, nuts?

1246
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,039
That's just the thing - they didn't
always pay that much attention to me.

1247
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,759
So, I left them, to find some
new folks who'd appreciate me more.

1248
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,759
I searched the whole world,
but nobody was good enough.

1249
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,319
Not even the Nelsons, who I just left.

1250
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,759
And they weren't bad folks.

1251
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,279
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

1252
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,279
Ah, there's nothing wrong with you.

1253
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,919
And I'm sure the Nelsons
weren't bad folks.

1254
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,519
They just weren't your folks.

1255
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,079
You see those people out there?
That audience?

1256
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,319
They paid attention to me.
They listened to every word I said.

1257
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,479
They laughed, they screamed,
they applauded. They loved me.

1258
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,079
But do you think that audience

1259
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,559
is gonna make me a cup of tea
if I'm not feeling well?

1260
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,610
Are they gonna help me when I get
in a fight with my best friend?

1261
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,679
Or - God forbid - I get in girl trouble.
Who am I going to turn to?

1262
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,759
I'll give you a hint -
it's not that audience.

1263
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,439
Oh, my God. What have I done?
I'll tell you.

1264
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,119
You've realised something that takes
most people a lifetime to figure out.

1265
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,479
Some people
never figure it out at all -

1266
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,959
that a bird in the hand is always greener

1267
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,201
than the grass
under the other guy's bushes.

1268

L...it's a metaphor

used mostly by gardeners
and landscape people in general.

Hey, kid. Where are you going'?

1272
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,519
Home. I miss my parents.

1273
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,959
How are you going to get to the airport'?

1274
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,919
You got a car?
No - I'm 11.

1275
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,763
Alright, then - we'd better take mine.

Make it Joey. And you're welcome.

stand the heat, stay out of Miami.

What does that metaphor mean?
What metaphor?

Not on this plane, you're not.
Why not?

But... I'm not!

I'm standing here talking to you.

Since I don't scare easily,

1295

you can imagine how it will affect
the other passengers.

Well, I guess you can say that.

'Cause in a manner of speaking,

1307

1318

Oh, Al... Can I have a word with you?

1319
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,529
Oh, sure, boss.

1320
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,319
Remember when you told me
North was dead?

1321
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,799
Yeah.

1322
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,280
Uh, just curious -
what did you base that on?

1323
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,399
I can only assume
that you think this is blood, Al.

1324
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,399
And if I had an IQ below 24,
I suppose I might think the same.

1325

But the stain in this cap
comes from borscht.

1326

Borscht'?
Yes, borscht.

most frequently served chilled
with a dollop of sour cream.

1329

I make a good borscht.
And I'd love to sample it someday.

The point I'm making here, Al,

1331
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,959
is that unless North's head

1332

this traditional Slavic delicacy,

Hey... You still here?

1399
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,209
Yeah... I must've fallen asleep.

1400
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,248
C'mon. I'll give you a ride home.

1401
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,799
And then you were a beach bum,
and then you drove a sleigh

1402
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,399
and then you were a comedian

1403
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,079
who said my parents
were the best parents for me.

1404

(Chuckles) I said that'?
Yeah.

1405
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,927
I must be a pretty smart guy.

What's that'?

1407

Oh, nothin'.

1408
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,519
Just something I've always had.

1409

You know - for good luck.

1410
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,719
Yeah, well, maybe good luck for you...

We were worried sick!

If anything ever happened to you,
I don't know what we'd do. (Kisses)
