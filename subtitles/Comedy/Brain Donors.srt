1
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,717
Here I am!

2
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,508
Who's this?

3
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,317
Look at that.

4
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,386
Watch that ladder.

5
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,841
What happened?

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,458
Let me try something here.
What is it?

7
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,676
What's gone wrong here, then?

8
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,791
Won't work, huh?
Here we go.

9
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,175
What are you guys looking at?

10
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,047
Get me out of here!

11
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,730
Here! It's mine!

12
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,602
Do you mind?

13
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,149
- Taxi!
- Taxi! Taxi!

14
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,358
Come on.

15
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,077
Jacques! Jacques, you're late!

16
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,283
I'm late. I have to mow
Mrs. Oglethorpe's lawn.

17
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,238
Stop that!

18
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,215
Stop that! Stop that!

19
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,488
You moron. There will be changes
around here after today,

20
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,089
and I will personally see
that you will be the first one to go.

21
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,585
- Allow me.
- Wipe off those filthy hands!

22
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,760
- Take this.
- Oh, for me?

23
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,764
Carry it to the house, you idiot!

24
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,371
Here you are, my dear.
Do come in, Edmund.

25
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,476
My dear Lillian.

26
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,439
I'm so sorry I'm late,
but there's so much to do

27
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,844
in handling the Oglethorpe enterprises
now that dear Oscar has passed on.

28
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,677
You are a good friend, Edmund.

29
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,342
And such a comfort
in my time of need.

30
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,581
I hope more than a friend, Lillian.

31
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,290
As the lawyer
for the Oglethorpe family,

32
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,395
I have been entrusted
with the last will and testament

33
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,793
of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.

34
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,900
- Edmund, I beg your pardon.
- Yes, dear lady?

35
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,901
I must apologize,
but we really must wait

36
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,598
for my personal solicitor,
Roland T. Flakfizer.

37
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,504
- Jacques.
- Lillian,

38
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,612
I've been employed by your late
husband for over 1 3 years.

39
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,079
- Are you dismissing me?
- Good heavens, no, Edmund.

40
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,620
I was involved in a minor accident
with the Bentley last year.

41
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,520
Miraculously, he was by my side
to assist me.

42
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,523
Oh, Jacques, I want you
to go to this address

43
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,290
and summon this gentleman at once.

44
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,662
I've been calling all morning
and leaving messages.

45
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,135
- I can't seem to reach him.
- Yes, Mrs. O...

46
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,104
Lillian, how long must we wait?

47
00:07:56,275 --> 00:08:00,075
I can assure you, once Mr. Flakfizer
receives my message,

48
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,079
he will race to be by my side.

49
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,885
Anyone hurt?

50
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,685
Roland T. Flakfizer, attorney at law.
Don't try to get up.

51
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,830
- I specialize in accident cases.
- We're both fine.

52
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,089
I know what I'm doing,
I know what I'm doing.

53
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,701
You wouldn't happen to have
any french fries on you, would you?

54
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,794
All right, all right.
Step back, step back.

55
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,098
I've got injured clients here.

56
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,072
Sir, you have caused grievous harm
to my clients and their vehicle.

57
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,644
And through your negligence, this
child has suffered severe neck injuries.

58
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,441
- Leave me alone.
- Stick with me, kid,

59
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,948
and you can afford enough Nintendo
software to sink a battleship.

60
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,815
- I can sue my parents?
- I sued mine.

61
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,755
- My neck!
- Corruptible youth. God bless them.

62
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,758
My Lord, madam. You shouldn't
be walking in your condition.

63
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,157
This woman is with child.

64
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,093
If any harm came to this infant,

65
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,396
by God, sir, you will
feel my wrath in court.

66
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,600
- What are you talking about?
- Don't try to weasel out of this.

67
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,904
Dozens of witnesses
saw your reckless driving.

68
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,010
How many of you
saw this man carelessly,

69
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,944
and without regard for life
and property,

70
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,677
careen into my clients
at almost 85 miles per hour?

71
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,082
And who of you will tell their story
to my young, 24-year-old,

72
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,386
Miss lnternational
Wet T-shirt champion,

73
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,926
nymphomaniac secretary?

74
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,189
Yo! Right here! Right here! Hey, hey!

75
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,130
Flakfizer's at it again, I see.

76
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,632
- Check for outstanding...
- Roland T. Flakfizer? That's him.

77
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,737
Thank you very much.
You agree with me, I agree with you.

78
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,104
Hold that thought. I swear,
I never touched your daughter.

79
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,844
Taxi!

80
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,275
Here we go.

81
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,350
Get in. Get in.

82
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,881
- Where to?
- Any place with no extradition laws.

83
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,118
- And step on it.
- Right.

84
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,500
- Mr. Roland T. Flakfizer?
- That depends.

85
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,862
- Do I owe you money?
- No.

86
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,833
In a drunken stupor,
did I promise to marry you?

87
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,403
- No.
- Then I'm your man.

88
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,769
- Lillian Oglethorpe wants to see you.
- The Lillian Oglethorpe?

89
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:21,402
In her mid-50s, with possible gusts
up to 60, 65?

90
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,980
- Yes. Can you come right away?
- Is she still rich?

91
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,348
By all means. The Oglethorpe place.

92
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,421
Big bucks. Yeah, you settle back,
I'll get you there safe and sound.

93
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,721
One-way street.

94
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,919
Don't worry, this happens a lot.

95
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,599
You enjoy driving a cab?

96
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,465
No. As soon as I get
me driver's license, I'm quitting.

97
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,371
A guy's really gotta haul rump
to make ends meet these days.

98
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:54,036
I mean, apart from the cab,
I'm a pool man, I perform liposuction,

99
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,738
I got me own toupee business.
My motto:

100
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,680
"Something that size
should have hair on it."

101
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,747
Aren't those numbers
clicking by awfully fast?

102
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,515
- You're probably a speed-reader.
- Well, you got me there.

103
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,181
Another two miles
and we own this cab.

104
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,350
- I hope you brought money.
- Oh, sure.

105
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,588
I have a wallet just like that.
Hey, that is my wallet.

106
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,357
When I get some money,
this could come in handy.

107
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,797
Such behavior.
Stealing another man's wallet.

108
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:20,063
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I don't believe it. You!

109
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,906
- What are you doing?
- Do you know who I am?

110
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,406
A psychotic cab driver?

111
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,169
I'm Rocco Melonchek.

112
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,972
I hope you know you're blowing
any possible tip.

113
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,705
You were my attorney
in my divorce case...

114
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,316
...until you started dating my wife
during the trial.

115
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,812
And you got the court to double the
alimony request she originally made.

116
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,115
You didn't want her to keep
seeing me in cheap motels, did you?

117
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,621
For God's sake, man,
she was your wife!

118
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,193
- Help me.
- Get off.

119
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,694
All right, all right, all right.

120
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,763
Five-minute break.

121
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,284
All right, break's over.

122
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,150
Wait a minute, wait.
You're a businessman.

123
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,154
- Let's talk business.
- Fine, and then I'll kill you.

124
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,883
I thought I recognized you.

125
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,028
I've been looking for you
for the past three years.

126
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,323
- You're lying.
- Of course I am, but hear me out.

127
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,295
Clients are impressed
by a law firm with a big staff.

128
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,832
The more employees,
the bigger the fees.

129
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,835
So I could use a man like you
in my organization.

130
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,496
Travel, excitement
and a chance for advancement.

131
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,369
Of course, you'll start out
on the bottom rung.

132
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,478
But work hard and in no time you'll
move up to next-to-the-bottom rung.

133
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,046
- You got a dental plan?
- Lose a tooth, you get two free.

134
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,046
- What's my job?
- You can be my chauffeur.

135
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,582
- How much?
- Two hundred bucks a week.

136
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,582
- 600.
- 300.

137
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,549
- 400.
- 800.

138
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,017
- 900.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

139
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,747
Shouldn't I be in this
negotiation somewhere?

140
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,152
- 350 and not a penny more.
- I'll take it.

141
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,987
- What happened to 1000?
- I allowed for taxes.

142
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,924
- I want four weeks in advance.
- Five weeks.

143
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,723
Hold it. I'm giving you
one minute to stop this.

144
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,523
- Two minutes.
- Five minutes.

145
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,461
- Seven minutes.
- Nine minutes.

146
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,032
I've stepped into my own private hell.

147
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,560
We'd better get going.

148
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,261
The faster we get to Lillian,
the quicker I can afford your salaries.

149
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,431
For 350 bucks a week, you drive.

150
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,813
Lillian, we really can't
wait any longer.

151
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,348
I suppose you're right, Edmund.

152
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,043
I can't imagine
what is keeping Roland.

153
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,959
- You guys wait here.
- Hey, you're the boss.

154
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,132
The reading of the last will
and testament...

155
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,200
...of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.

156
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,269
- Roland!
- Please,

157
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,306
call me what everyone else
calls me: "Your Royal Sex Machine."

158
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,171
I wouldn't come without bringing
you a terribly expensive gift.

159
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,439
I hope you like it.
It reminds me of you.

160
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,483
Roland, how thoughtful of you.
But I believe I have one just like it.

161
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,415
Oh, no problem. I'll take it back
and get the money.

162
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,579
Mrs. Oglethorpe, you look wonderful.

163
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,123
I could make love to you
right here and now.

164
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,922
Roland, please. Let's keep this
on a professional level.

165
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,190
Very well, then.
I'll charge you 50 bucks a pop.

166
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,465
Mr. Oglethorpe!
How well I remember him.

167
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,664
Gone now, but not forgotten. I was
never crazy about his taste in clothes.

168
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,435
I hope this speech doesn't seem
like a rambling affair,

169
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,635
which is something I'm sure
we'll be involved in.

170
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,975
Oh, Lillian, you make me feel
just like a natural woman.

171
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,249
I've heard enough.

172
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,216
- Sir, I am appalled.
- Lillian, who is this man?

173
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,414
Roland, this is Mr. Edmund Lazlo.

174
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,082
A likely story. Just look at him.

175
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,922
He's obviously after your money
and social standing,

176
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,324
but I was here first.

177
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,023
Hey, how is everyone?

178
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,031
- Have you got any mustard in here?
- Hey, I'm the boss, remember?

179
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,569
- I told you to wait outside.
- Today's my day off.

180
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,833
Excuse me.
And just who are you?

181
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,342
He's a member of my staff.
Lillian Oglethorpe, Rocco Melonchek.

182
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,912
Rocco Melonchek, Lillian Oglethorpe.

183
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,070
In order to tell you two apart,

184
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,546
one of you will
have to wear a mustache.

185
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,345
Nice to meet someone else who buys
their clothes at big-and-tall-man shops.

186
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,920
- I beg your pardon?
- Why? You can't help it.

187
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,359
Refreshments.
Good idea, Jacques.

188
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,027
He was so devoted to my husband.

189
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,791
Darling Oscar is dead now, you know.

190
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,162
Well, I hope so.
I understand they buried him.

191
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,228
- Just make yourself feel at home.
- Lillian,

192
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,236
I really do believe we should begin.

193
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,773
Oh, yes, yes, certainly.

194
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,411
Will you all please
find yourselves a seat?

195
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,306
Oh, I beg your...

196
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,977
The last will and testament

197
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,788
of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.

198
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,653
- Do you have a bathroom?
- I protest! This is most irregular!

199
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,990
- Lillian...
- Edmund! Please be careful.

200
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:42,031
This man is in obviously no condition
to carry on. Rocco, will you continue?

201
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,228
- Lillian, l...
- Right, let's cut to the payoff here.

202
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:51,540
Blah, blah, blah... Minnesota holdings,
ski boat, ski boat, ski boat... Yacht...

203
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,372
"To my gay lover, I leave--"

204
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,547
It was a joke. I was just joking.

205
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,941
Yes. Now. Yes, here we are.

206
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,211
"All my worldly goods to be transferred
into the care of my wife, Lillian."

207
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,913
- Darling.
- "And because of my love

208
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,183
for the arts, I request
that half my fortune

209
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,520
be used to establish
a ballet company."

210
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,391
Excellent. Wonderful. Nothing like
the thrill of spending an evening

211
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,156
watching a bunch
of anorexics leaping around,

212
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,358
guys with bulging genitals...

213
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,662
I hope I'm not arousing you.

214
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,233
This is all very well and good,
but I wouldn't know the first thing

215
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,742
- about running such a company.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe...

216
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,207
-...as your trusted lawyer...
- You can use those words together?

217
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,610
...and friend...

218
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,083
...I naturally assumed
that task would fall to me.

219
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,722
Why would anyone wanna be
the head of a ballet company?

220
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,723
"And the director of the company shall
receive $500,000 a year salary."

221
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,886
I'll take the job. I have ballet
running through my veins.

222
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,497
Lillian, I'm your man!

223
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,792
Outrageous! I doubt whether
he knows the difference

224
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,992
between the first, second, third,
fourth or fifth positions!

225
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,297
Hey, he is strictly missionary position.

226
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,431
I will not allow a rogue like you
to handle the Oglethorpe Ballet.

227
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,277
This document should be treated

228
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,242
with the dignity and respect
it deserves.

229
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,143
Hello! This is no time
for family pictures.

230
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,251
Charity work. I gather these for those
less fortunate than ourselves

231
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,387
who can't afford pornography.

232
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,053
Edmund!

233
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,960
I demand this man
be dismissed immediately!

234
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,190
- Jacques, you're working for me now.
- For what reason?

235
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,492
- Does it make you angry?
- Yes!

236
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,499
That's a good enough reason for me.

237
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,729
Lillian, I have a dream.

238
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,805
We'll bring in a whole new breed

239
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,839
of ballet-goers
with innovative giveaways.

240
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,375
Leotard nights, wet tutu competitions.

241
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,137
And we'll be the first company
performing ballet

242
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,542
for the hard of hearing.

243
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,182
We'll have the ballerinas
wear wooden shoes.

244
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,148
Mrs. Oglethorpe, this man
doesn't know what he's talking about.

245
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,947
Now, leave this matter to me

246
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,614
and I will sign for you the world's
premier dancer, The Great Volare.

247
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,317
Volare? How wonderful.

248
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:53,693
Wait a second! Uno pari-mutuel.
Not the Volare!

249
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,697
You know The Great Volare?

250
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,428
I knew him back when he was known
as the Pretty Good Volare.

251
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,196
We served in the Army together.
He owes me one.

252
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,966
I threw myself on top of an 1 8-year-old
Vietnamese girl and saved his life.

253
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,133
- Nonsense!
- That's where you're wrong.

254
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,073
This is nonsense.

255
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,216
Lillian, I am the only one
who can bring you

256
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,324
the world's greatest male ballerina.

257
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,052
For myself, I ask only
a nominal salary,

258
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,560
plus a cut of gross receipts,
a bonus of 25 percent

259
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,494
on anything above break-even,
a $300 per diem,

260
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,258
the use of a company car
and housing.

261
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,029
By all means, make my
husband's dream come true.

262
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,105
What, you want him
to marry a cheerleader?

263
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,568
Give us a ballet.
Oh, this is so exciting.

264
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,272
I can see I am no longer required
as the family lawyer.

265
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,006
Look, I'm thinking of
becoming a lawyer.

266
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,379
- Can I buy your diploma off you?
- Good heavens.

267
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,180
I need you both.

268
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,845
Very well, Lillian. As you wish.

269
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,160
- For now.
- Then this evening I'm off to the ballet.

270
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,763
I must shave, shower, get new clothes
and practice signing your name.

271
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,023
My pearl... I bid you all a fondue.

272
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,728
If you should lose this hand in an
industrial accident, keep it for me.

273
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,635
Gentlemen!

274
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,271
Alan.

275
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,514
I brought this for you. It's not exactly
a bouquet, but it's a start.

276
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,880
So sweet. Were you watching
the ballet again tonight?

277
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,022
Of course. I love to watch you dance.

278
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,658
Someday we're gonna be
on that stage dancing together.

279
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,953
At the rate I'm going,
I'm not so sure.

280
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,720
Alan, don't talk that way.

281
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,761
We agreed that if one of us
got into a major company,

282
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,263
it could only help the both of us.

283
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,827
Tonight I'm going to talk
to Volare about you.

284
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,200
I would love that. I mean, no one
dances like The Great Volare.

285
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,136
Except you.

286
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,970
Catch.

287
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,910
Tickets, please?

288
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,645
No smoking in the theater.

289
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,250
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

290
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,828
Please.

291
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,428
- Five and six.
- Eleven.

292
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,506
Now it's your turn: 25 and 67.

293
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,438
Miss!

294
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,876
These seats are dreadful.
They're facing the stage.

295
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,249
Hey, did we miss
the coming attractions?

296
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,014
Who's the bad guy?

297
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,748
Is Tom Cruise in this?

298
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,063
Do you work out?

299
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,552
- I'm looking for The Great Volare.
- He's on-stage.

300
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,658
And he doesn't appreciate
visitors backstage.

301
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:44,262
No, no, no, I'm not a visitor.
This is strictly business.

302
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,223
- This creep bothering you?
- No. No.

303
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,128
She's quite delightful, thank you.

304
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,539
Ok, I give up. How come
he doesn't throw up?

305
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,912
Bravo, Mr. Volare. They love you.

306
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,106
That audience wouldn't know
a ballet from a bullfight.

307
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,877
And who are you to speak to me?
Where is my towel?

308
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,953
When I come off-stage,
I expect my towel immediately.

309
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,953
- Do you understand me?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

310
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,591
Fire him.

311
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,458
Tina, darling, you were marvelous.

312
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,257
Perhaps we should meet in my
dressing room after the performance

313
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,662
and discuss your career.

314
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,362
I'd like that very much,
Mr. Volare.

315
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,129
- Thank you.
- Lisa!

316
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,442
Darling, I thought we'd have dinner
tonight after the closing-night party.

317
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,602
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm afraid
I've already made plans.

318
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,476
Mr. Volare, I'd like you
to meet my friend Alan Grant.

319
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,584
It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Volare.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

320
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,784
Well, Alan's a dancer too,
with the Performing Artists Group,

321
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,014
the nonprofit ballet troupe.

322
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,954
Really? How sweet.

323
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:52,927
It's a fine idea to keep busy until one
is good enough to command a salary.

324
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,757
My cue.

325
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:20,185
- She looked 1 8, officer, I swear!
- Too noisy around here.

326
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:23,191
I'll say. I got twice the sleep
at a Julio lglesias concert.

327
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,988
This guy's gotta get off-stage soon.

328
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,256
Let's go back, wait for him,
sign him up.

329
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,399
Excuse us. Excuse me. We have
to get this plutonium back to the lab.

330
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,626
- Jacques.
- Hey.

331
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,489
- You know him?
- Sure.

332
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,559
He used to drive Mr. Oglethorpe
to the theater,

333
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,824
- then I'd sneak him into the ballet.
- I'm gonna be the best man

334
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,092
- at their wedding.
- I hope so.

335
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,428
Excuse me,
we didn't get your name.

336
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,729
Oh, my name's Rocco Melonchek.

337
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,997
I'm the ballet world's
up-and-coming manager/agent.

338
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,334
I'm here to sign a contract
with The Great Volare.

339
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,205
I hate to burst your bubble, but Volare
already has an agent and manager.

340
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,812
That's too bad.
Any of them real sick?

341
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,676
You don't need Volare.
What you need

342
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,545
is the next great ballet talent.
A young, fresh face.

343
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,811
- Alan Grant.
- Exactly.

344
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,386
- I got it right.
- There's my cue.

345
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,422
Jacques, convince Mr. Melonchek
Alan's the person he's looking for.

346
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,323
This is all well and good, but can
he dance? Could he make millions?

347
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,486
Would he sign a contract
for a lot of money, but take scale,

348
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,029
Ieaving his manager
with everything else?

349
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,032
Sure he would.
Wouldn't you, Alan? Alan?

350
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,729
Can't you see he's watching
the woman he adores?

351
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,373
- You're in love with her, aren't you?
- You bet.

352
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,206
- When's the wedding?
- There won't be one...

353
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,038
...unless I can find a job dancing.

354
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,407
To tell you the truth, Mr. Melonchek,
I'm about out of money

355
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,344
and I'm gonna have to
go back to Minneapolis.

356
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,244
I'll tell you what. Don't you buy
that plane ticket just yet,

357
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,546
because I am gonna
get you an audition

358
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,121
with Roland T. Flakfizer,
ballet director.

359
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,624
- You could do that?
- Sure. They're like this.

360
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,062
Well, let's go to work,
Mr. Melonchek.

361
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,825
I now pronounce us
dancer and manager.

362
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,490
Yeah!

363
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,326
Come in.

364
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,673
Tina, darling. I'm so glad you've come.

365
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,370
You were most inspiring tonight.

366
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:27,007
I can see that under my guidance,
your career will soar.

367
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,279
Already I can hear the audience roar.

368
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,054
- Who are you?
- Roland T. Flakfizer,

369
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,852
managing director of the
Oglethorpe-Flakfizer Ballet Company.

370
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,995
You wouldn't happen to have
a plunger on you, would you?

371
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,030
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I see you have a pretty visitor.

372
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,134
I'll tell you what.
I'll get a girl and we'll double.

373
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,132
- You got five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?

374
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,500
My God! Have you consulted
another doctor?

375
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,074
- You are out of line.
- And you are out of toilet paper.

376
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,837
- But we're still short one girl.
- What are you doing here?

377
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:59,507
- To sign you for my ballet company.
- To sign me for your ballet company?

378
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,174
Swear to God, I just said that.

379
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,346
Why don't you run along
and let us men talk business.

380
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,856
Just leave your phone number
and favorite color with the manager

381
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,824
and later we'll talk business.

382
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,526
- You're cute, Mr...?
- Garvey. Steve Garvey.

383
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,530
I think we have something beautiful,
you and l.

384
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,134
Someday you'll have my children.

385
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,703
In fact, they're out in the car,
if you want them.

386
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,839
Oh, God...

387
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,772
You're still here?

388
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,744
I will have you thrown out
of the theater.

389
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:34,544
- First, we talk ballet.
- I know nothing of your ballet.

390
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,085
We have a lot in common. I'm
managing director and I don't either.

391
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,086
Look, I don't dance for just anyone.

392
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,715
I am ballet. My dance shoes
are in the Louvre in Paris.

393
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,759
So what? Last year,
I left a raincoat in Cleveland.

394
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,864
Do you realize what I was doing
at the age of 7?

395
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,501
I can imagine. You must be thankful
you didn't go blind.

396
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,734
I was dancing professionally.

397
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,032
Well, whatever you call it: flogging the
carrot, polishing the cue stick,

398
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,731
choking the chicken,
clearing the snorkel...

399
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,968
But I didn't come back here
to rehash good times.

400
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,512
Volare, dance with the
Oglethorpe-Flakfizer Ballet Company

401
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,277
and you can name your price.
Money is no object.

402
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:13,288
It isn't mine. Look, I'm offering you
a check for $500,000.

403
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,427
It's made out to Volare, Great, The.

404
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,320
I don't dance for the money.

405
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,123
Then you dance
and I'll keep the money.

406
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,664
Look, I will not dance
for your ballet and that is final.

407
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,961
A Flakfizer doesn't know
the meaning of the word "no."

408
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,934
And we're a little fuzzy on the word
"panagglutinin" and "viscosity."

409
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,667
All right, all right. Let's sweeten
the pot. The same money,

410
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,970
- we throw in a girl.
- No!

411
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,612
Then would you object
to me getting one?

412
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,145
I'm a lonely man, Mr. Volare.

413
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,681
I will give you till the count
of ten to get out of here.

414
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,876
- One, two, three--
- Before you get stuck

415
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,681
somewhere around six, I'll go.

416
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,122
If there's anything I can ever do
for you, forget it.

417
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,625
Because I don't do
those kind of things.

418
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,697
And for the last time, I warn you
about that highly contagious rash.

419
00:28:54,866 --> 00:29:00,236
I beg you to see to it at once.
Hygiene, Mr. Volare. Hygiene.

420
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,731
- Mr. Flakfizer.
- Where?!

421
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,341
I'm sorry, I thought
my father showed up.

422
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,239
Come here, come here.
Did Volare accept your offer?

423
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,777
I didn't know the meaning
of the word "no,"

424
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,039
but he had it down pretty good.

425
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,876
You wouldn't happen
to have a world-famous dancer

426
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,347
stuffed in a drawer somewhere,
would you?

427
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,713
As a matter of fact, I would.
His name's Alan Grant.

428
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,582
He can dance rings around Volare.

429
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,485
He's even more talented
than Gorbachev.

430
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,646
- Gesundheit.
- Baryshnikov.

431
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,850
- God bless you.
- Baryshnikov.

432
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,219
Hi. How's it going? How you doing?
You look very nice today.

433
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,920
He's one of the best dancers
in the country.

434
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,463
Hire him for the ballet.
What do you say?

435
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:32,296
No, no, nay, nyet. I have to find
some way to sign Volare.

436
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,028
When I do that,
I'm director of the ballet.

437
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,196
And, gentlemen, that spells cash
with a capital...

438
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,001
- K.
- You should go back to school.

439
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,905
I hated teaching.

440
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,309
- Flakfizer, I thought you were smart.
- I am smart. I said no to you, didn't l?

441
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,210
I'm offering you two incomes.

442
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,680
Your paycheck
from the ballet company

443
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,318
and then when you sign
Alan Grant to dance,

444
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,477
another hefty check as part
of Alan's management team.

445
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,054
How do we get this
past Mrs. Oglethorpe?

446
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,920
Relax. After she sees Alan dance,
you've got nothing to worry about.

447
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,925
Except for taxes,
depletion of the ozone layer

448
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,461
and diseases
due to any sexual contact.

449
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,822
- That's a load off my mind.
- All you gotta do

450
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,969
is convince Mrs. Oglethorpe
to let Alan into the charity bazaar.

451
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,331
Are you kidding?
I can charm the pants off of her.

452
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,239
Now, that is a disgusting thought.

453
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,968
Gentlemen, you're gonna
have to sneak him in.

454
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,408
Not so fast.

455
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,209
You know, I worry about you,
I really do.

456
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,214
We're gonna make this legal.
We need a contract.

457
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,250
A binding document,
with plenty of loopholes.

458
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,186
Exactly. Jacques, draw up the
standard contract, would you, please?

459
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,173
Hello, Jacques.

460
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,720
We've got years to go before we even
come close to the Japanese.

461
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,019
Right. Sign that.

462
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,264
- This paper's blank.
- I'll fill it in later.

463
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,229
Fair enough. You're not gonna
cheat me or anything?

464
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,958
I give you my word as a gentleman.

465
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,727
Well, you had me until then.

466
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:16,305
All right, all right. Fifty-fifty split.

467
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,142
- Now, this is more like it.
- What about me?

468
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,175
To show you no favoritism,
Rocco and l

469
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:25,009
- will also split your salary fifty-fifty.
- Thanks.

470
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,980
That should keep you out
of a higher income bracket.

471
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,483
Come to think of it, that should
keep you out of any income bracket.

472
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:35,320
Rocco, Jacques, tomorrow, Alan Grant
joins the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.

473
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,498
Ladies and gentlemen...

474
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:47,969
...welcome to the Ninth Annual
Oglethorpe Charity Festival.

475
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,300
- Let's go.
- It gives me great pleasure

476
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,467
to announce the
Oglethorpe Ballet Company

477
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,012
will be leaving for New York
tomorrow, where we...

478
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,978
You two go and get dressed.
Be ready in ten minutes.

479
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,119
- T en minutes? We'll be ready.
- And you're gonna be a star.

480
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,414
You know, if you keep this up,
I may even start to believe it.

481
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,021
Nice to have a chance to make
someone's wish come true.

482
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,556
That's a nice thing to do.

483
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,474
Well, how did the market close?

484
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,942
Well, roll over my amalgamated,
split my utilities

485
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,842
and double my
capital venture overlays.

486
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,643
Now, call me in an hour and tell me
what the hell I'm talking about.

487
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,479
Pull over. Everybody all set?

488
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,848
We've got everything
so under control, it's pathetic.

489
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,114
- And so is he.
- Good.

490
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,190
Driver, drive on.

491
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,348
Look out for that truck!

492
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,358
- Buffy...
- Lillian.

493
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,429
Get this thing up on the rack
and have it overhauled.

494
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,532
Better yet, why don't you get up
on the rack and I'll see you in an hour.

495
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,328
Avanti!

496
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,238
Here, Buffy. There you are.

497
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,501
- Darling.
- Have you come to see Mommy?

498
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,839
What a charming little animal.

499
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,709
Do you know dogs, Mr. Melonchek?

500
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,976
Know dogs? I used to be a chef
in a Korean restaurant.

501
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,221
Good food, good friends,
good conversation.

502
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,847
Roland, I'm so upset
Volare turned us down.

503
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,824
I know. What a slap
in our collective faces.

504
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,829
Like I told you, he has no respect
for our ballet.

505
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,058
I wouldn't want a man like that
dancing for me.

506
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,896
- Or with me, for that matter.
- I offered him half the moon.

507
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,197
I keep asking myself,
"Why didn't he sign with us?"

508
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,897
Because he said
he wouldn't work with you

509
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,439
if you were the last person
on earth.

510
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,043
- What was that?
- Nothing. Fetch.

511
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,809
My darling Lillian,
Volare has shunned us.

512
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:42,681
Hold your chins up high, for I have
discovered a fabulous young dancer.

513
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,345
- A talent that soars.
- Volare.

514
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,956
It's Volare!

515
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,252
Oh, good heavens. It's him.

516
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,094
- It's Volare.
- Step back. Step back. Step back.

517
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,027
Lillian, permit me to introduce

518
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,224
- The Great Volare.
- I've seen greater.

519
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,896
SignorVolare, I understand you've
refused to dance with our company.

520
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,474
The truth of the matter is Mr. Volare
won't work with Mr. Flakfizer.

521
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,573
But, my dear Lillian,
I am happy to announce

522
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,044
that I have signed Mr. Volare

523
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,843
to dance with
and to be the artistic director

524
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,918
of the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.

525
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,385
Ladies and gentlemen,
the overture has started.

526
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,423
- Overture to what?
- The ballet find of the century.

527
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,253
- What?
- Roll up! Roll up!

528
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,328
Top-class ballet, this way!

529
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,123
Lillian, just a little surprise
I cooked up.

530
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,630
If you don't like it,
it was Rocco's idea.

531
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,134
Oh, Roland, I love a surprise.

532
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,196
Yeah!

533
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,223
Yo, Rocco, Rocco.

534
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,184
Mrs. Oglethorpe, meet the future
world champion of ballet,

535
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,350
- Mr. Alan Grant.
- It's a pleasure.

536
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,756
Nice to meet you.

537
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,296
Mrs. Oglethorpe, I would like to make
an announcement.

538
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,730
- He's being deported.
- I have found my prima ballerina...

539
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,962
-...the lovely Miss Lisa Le Baron.
- What? Well...

540
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,298
But what about Alan?

541
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,271
Shall we say,
a most unusual technique.

542
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,775
Perhaps better suited
to experimental theater.

543
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,277
You can't talk to my client like that.

544
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,438
If Alan isn't in the company,
I won't be either.

545
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,084
- Neither will l.
- That's a victory for all mankind.

546
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,015
You're making a mistake, my dear.

547
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,314
Lisa, I agree with Volare.

548
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,787
But, Alan, we'll be apart for months.

549
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,586
Remember when you told me
that with you dancing,

550
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,625
- it would be good for both of us?
- Yes, but--

551
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,492
When Volare makes you a star,
you can choose anyone to dance with.

552
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,394
Dance with the Oglethorpe.

553
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,229
Come on. I'll be the proudest
guy in the country.

554
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,267
- All right.
- You've made a wise choice, my dear.

555
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,241
- Then it's settled. I am so excited.
- You're excited? Feel these nipples.

556
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,312
Now, Lillian, about the directorship
of the ballet company...

557
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,177
Oh, yes. Yes, of course, Edmund.

558
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,377
You have brought us
The Great Volare.

559
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:40,149
And dear Roland has presented us
with our ballerina.

560
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:44,852
I think it only fair that you
and Roland share the honor.

561
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,362
- Flakfizer? This is preposterous.
- Preposterous, is it?

562
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,056
Why don't we step outside

563
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,828
- and settle this like men.
- We are outside.

564
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,131
Then why don't we step inside
and settle this like women.

565
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,967
Or are you afraid, Lazlo?

566
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,439
- I'm twice the man you are.
- So is she.

567
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,544
And it's driving me mad.

568
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,441
Oh, Lillian, can't you see I'm on fire?

569
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,710
And you, you contemptible cur!

570
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,079
Maybe you don't want to work
for Mrs. Oglethorpe.

571
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:12,017
- Is that so, Edmund?
- Of course not!

572
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,384
I will do anything
that is best for the ballet.

573
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,492
Well, there's no need
to commit suicide.

574
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,289
And to show you no hard feelings,
how about a cigar.

575
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,055
- I don't smoke.
- Well, I do.

576
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,166
Why don't you run out
and get me one.

577
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,995
And now, since I'm in charge
of the ballet,

578
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,502
just jamming that thought home,
I propose a toast.

579
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,072
Champagne!

580
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,072
I'm not going to work
with such an uncouth pig.

581
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,110
- Certainly, Mr. Volare.
- Now it's on to New York!

582
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,678
And a hefty per diem.

583
00:38:58,168 --> 00:38:59,465
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

584
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:01,035
Here you go. Here you go.

585
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,433
I'm all out of American currency.

586
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,632
Take a fistful of Romanian 50s,
all right?

587
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,046
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

588
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,848
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

589
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,058
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

590
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,456
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

591
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,765
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

592
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:30,490
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

593
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:34,125
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

594
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:44,969
The end of another grueling day.

595
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:49,316
The press conference
is to begin in five minutes.

596
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:51,477
Roland seems to be running
a little late.

597
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,954
Late? That charlatan
hasn't been around in weeks.

598
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:58,219
I don't know why you put up with him.
He's never in his office.

599
00:39:58,395 --> 00:39:59,953
He never responds to his calls.

600
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,425
He's totally irresponsible.

601
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,833
Lisa. Relax, my dear.
Everyone is nervous their first time.

602
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,839
Just follow my lead.
I'm very experienced.

603
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:16,173
- That's very kind of you, Mr. Volare.
- Oh, come on. Call me Roberto.

604
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,404
Roberto.

605
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:23,986
Lisa, I know an intimate little bistro
with a fabulous view of the city.

606
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:28,414
Perhaps dinner
and an all-night boat ride?

607
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,423
Well, I don't really think that
would be such a good idea--

608
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,994
I hope I'm interrupting something.

609
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:35,495
Volare, you know it's not polite
to drool in public.

610
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,829
Roland, I haven't seen you
for weeks.

611
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:43,705
Lillian, my pile of sweetness.
I'm so sorry.

612
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:47,037
I've been busy promoting our ballet
at beauty pageants.

613
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,939
And then, of course,
there's my volunteer work

614
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:51,808
at the breast-implant clinic.
And how I missed you.

615
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,246
In fact, I missed you so much,
two days ago I went out

616
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,215
and I bought a woman
who looks just like you.

617
00:40:56,386 --> 00:41:00,652
- Oh, you silly.
- For you. From you.

618
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:03,224
Another lovely bracelet.

619
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:05,725
I didn't want this wrist
to think I was neglecting it.

620
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,023
- Oh, Roland...
- Lillian, l--

621
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:10,063
Lazlo, I didn't see you there.
I stand corrected.

622
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,793
I saw you, but I chose to ignore you.

623
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,402
Lisa, my darling.

624
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:19,201
Will you excuse us? Two's company
and three's an adult movie.

625
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,305
- Mrs. Oglethorpe, may we start?
- Oh, please.

626
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,411
Is she a fox or what?

627
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,448
Ladies and gentlemen,
for many weeks now

628
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:01,641
the Oglethorpe Ballet Company
have been in rehearsal.

629
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:05,254
Tomorrow we open with
Roberto Volare's interpretation

630
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,515
of Tears of the Swan.

631
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:13,129
At this time, I wish to introduce
to you the creative genius

632
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:17,027
behind our company, the brightest
light in the ballet firmament...

633
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,363
Thank you for those kind words,
Edmund Lazlo.

634
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,365
I don't know who does your hair,
but tell me,

635
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:25,599
where do they do it
and when are they bringing it back?

636
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,540
Well, I had a speech all prepared,

637
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,738
but today I'm going to speak
from the heart.

638
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:35,316
You've no doubt asked yourself,
"Why has he been chosen

639
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:37,510
for this task of running
the Oglethorpe?"

640
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:41,054
Well, the whole story is right here
in my autobiography:

641
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:43,385
Flakfizer: A Man's Man.

642
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,959
But I like women a lot more.

643
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:48,723
My intimate views of Jackie,
Cher, Sean, Larry, Moe, Curly.

644
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,561
Over 200 pages
of provocative pictures,

645
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,464
and only one page
has any writing on it.

646
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:58,802
Act now and you can get one of these
fabulous "Flakfizer is ballet" T-shirts.

647
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:00,738
MasterCard and Visas accepted.

648
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,175
That brings me to the task at hand,

649
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:08,784
to introduce the woman I adore.
Behind every great man is a woman.

650
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:12,410
And thank heaven I have Lillian
Oglethorpe, because, quite frankly,

651
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:14,250
I enjoy the shade.

652
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:18,622
Dear Lillian, soon I hope to take you
on a Caribbean cruise,

653
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,830
where we can hold hands
on a soft summer's evening

654
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:25,161
and watch that old Jamaican moon.

655
00:43:25,335 --> 00:43:28,702
Why that old Jamaican
will be mooning us, I have no idea.

656
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,197
And now, here she is,

657
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:33,467
the woman voted by her senior class

658
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:36,168
"most likely to go up
a few dress sizes,"

659
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:39,315
a woman who would be a man,
except her name is Lillian,

660
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,915
Lillian Oglethorpe.

661
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,055
Thank you. Thank you.

662
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,362
Hey. Hey, what's with all the tears?

663
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,794
This should be the happiest night
of your life.

664
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,025
I know it should be. It's just that...

665
00:43:58,201 --> 00:43:59,862
...I miss Alan so much.

666
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:03,369
Well, I'd feel the same way if the man
I loved was thousands of miles away.

667
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,531
Of course, I'd be living
a whole different lifestyle.

668
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:08,801
Here, come with me.
I know just the thing to cheer you up.

669
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:13,245
If you just step right in here, my dear,
your spirits might just brighten.

670
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,884
- But that's Mr. Volare's dressing room.
- Of course.

671
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:17,952
He's got the best champagne.

672
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:23,058
- Alan!
- Lisa.

673
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:27,194
Flakfizer flew Alan out to see you
in the opening of the ballet.

674
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,195
It's a formal affair.
Do you have tuxedos?

675
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,425
I got mine.

676
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,838
That's great for tomorrow, but aren't
you a little overdressed for today?

677
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,635
Oh, no.

678
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:45,578
- I'm very impressed.
- I don't have any luggage.

679
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,183
Then this all makes sense.
I was worried there for a second.

680
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,653
Mr. Flakfizer, thank you.

681
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,254
I see you're saving your best stuff
for Alan.

682
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,453
I think we should leave the lovers
alone for a few minutes.

683
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:05,594
Make that a few hours.

684
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:17,942
- I missed you so much.
- I don't want us to be apart ever again.

685
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:21,015
- I told you before!
- Oh, my God, it's Volare.

686
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:24,119
- You better hide.
- Don't hang my tight by the crotch!

687
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:26,653
- It throws off my bulge!
- Yes, Volare, I'm sorry.

688
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,652
Lisa, what a pleasant surprise.

689
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,992
I see you decided to start
our little party early, huh?

690
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:39,829
- Roberto, you've got the wrong idea.
- Oh, no. I think I've got the right idea.

691
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,965
- Roberto, stop it!
- Get your hands off of her!

692
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:50,072
- You! What are you doing here?
- Mr. Flakfizer flew me out.

693
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,012
You and Mr. Flakfizer are going
to be sorry for this.

694
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:58,987
- Volare, what happened?
- It's Flakfizer.

695
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,385
He's brought that performance artist
out here.

696
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:05,324
- Hasn't that information arrived yet?
- No, but we may not need it.

697
00:46:05,495 --> 00:46:09,090
I have devised a little plan.
He's staying at Lillian's townhouse.

698
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,394
All we have to do is make
a few arrangements.

699
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:32,479
Oh, no. Lillian?

700
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:44,428
- Well, no one's in.
- Roland.

701
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:50,138
This is just a business call.
I didn't think you were back so soon.

702
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,834
- Roland.
- Lillian...

703
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,275
...can't we just be friends?

704
00:46:58,381 --> 00:46:59,473
Why, you're not Lillian.

705
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,009
- You gonna spank me?
- We can start there...

706
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,818
...and see what happens.

707
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,389
- Are we alone?
- Servants have the day off.

708
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:11,891
Lillian is already at the theater,
but I'm here.

709
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:15,225
- Take me.
- Okay. Let's say two out of three falls.

710
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:17,161
No standing eight count.

711
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:20,936
Wait. I wanna make love
by candlelight.

712
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,963
I could do you one better.

713
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:34,213
I think this is more in keeping
with...things to come.

714
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:41,387
Not a bad little pad Lillian's got here.

715
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,090
- Was that the doorbell?
- That wasn't you?

716
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:47,855
Never mind. Just ignore it.

717
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,295
Well, it's a big house.
Maybe they can't hear the bell.

718
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,628
Let's try this.

719
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:55,396
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

720
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:59,940
If you need anything, there's plenty
of batteries in my room.

721
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,875
Oh, let me try this.

722
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,073
Good idea.
You go through the window.

723
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:10,651
If the alarm goes off, I'll run away
so they won't catch both of us.

724
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,447
We don't want any! Oh, it's you.

725
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,021
We have to talk. It's very important.

726
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,715
Look. The next half-hour,
give or take 29 minutes,

727
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:19,293
will be very important for me,
so thanks for dropping by.

728
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:20,724
Yeah, but--

729
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,091
Flakfizer!

730
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:25,427
- The face is familiar.
- It's mine.

731
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,002
And so it is. Say, if you ever visit
this planet again,

732
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,832
give me a call. We'll have lunch.

733
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:32,304
- Flakfizer.
- How come you didn't knock?

734
00:48:32,475 --> 00:48:34,238
I'm using a better grade of gas.

735
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:37,970
- That's not bad, is it?
- You know, I always enjoy it

736
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,082
when we get together,
but I want you out,

737
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,150
or I'll be forced to kill you.
I'll tell the police

738
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:47,017
- I did it out of love.
- Flakie, aren't you coming to bed?

739
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,921
- That's a girl.
- Not just a girl, a way of life.

740
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,459
What if Mrs. Oglethorpe
comes back?

741
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,756
She'll have to wait her turn.
I saw Tina first.

742
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,990
Don't you see? Lazlo wants
Mrs. Oglethorpe to catch you

743
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,566
in bed with her!

744
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:01,300
Oh, no!
Mrs. Oglethorpe!

745
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:06,739
I've been in situations like this before.
We act calm.

746
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,537
Stay cool.

747
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:16,249
Okay, okay. Tina leaves by the
back door and no one is any the wiser.

748
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:20,515
- It's an old Gary Hart trick.
- I'm not leaving till I'm satisfied.

749
00:49:28,264 --> 00:49:29,390
You beast!

750
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,966
Really has a such a nice light touch
with women.

751
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,662
You big brute! How dare you...

752
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,065
Get her out of sight!

753
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,773
No, no, no! That's Lillian's room.

754
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,312
- In here. In here.
- Not there!

755
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,384
She can't be found there.
That's my room.

756
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,587
I don't know why you insist
on returning to my home.

757
00:49:53,756 --> 00:49:56,224
We can't miss the
final dress rehearsal of the ballet.

758
00:49:56,392 --> 00:49:59,122
Lillian, my dear,
we can't go without Flakfizer.

759
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,229
I just thought it would make
for a better appearance

760
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:04,264
if we all arrive at the same time.

761
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:07,494
You have been looking at your watch
all morning, Edmund.

762
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,537
Your behavior is most peculiar.

763
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,265
You big animal!

764
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:15,040
What was that?
We must investigate!

765
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:17,179
Edmund, what is this?

766
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,281
You relentless sex stallion.

767
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,041
Oh, great.
Now she's talking about me.

768
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,282
What was that?

769
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,115
Jacques, show her what will happen
if she doesn't shut up.

770
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,225
That came from your suite.

771
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:33,385
- Hide her!
- My bedroom?

772
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:42,635
Ninety-eight, 99, 100.
Lillian, Lazlo. My two favorite L's.

773
00:50:42,805 --> 00:50:44,898
What on earth are you doing here
at this ungodly hour?

774
00:50:45,074 --> 00:50:47,304
I know you're up to something,
Flakfizer.

775
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:50,139
- A snap inspection?
- Roland.

776
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:54,807
- What are you doing in my bedroom?
- This is your room? Thank God.

777
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:57,612
I thought someone sewed up
all my fly-holes.

778
00:50:58,154 --> 00:51:00,645
Lazlo, how about the three of us
going down to the kitchen

779
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:03,257
- and making a big sandwich.
- I hardly think so.

780
00:51:03,426 --> 00:51:04,791
I'm going to check under the bed.

781
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,626
Edmund! What on earth
has gotten into you?

782
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,972
- Be more careful.
- You did that on purpose.

783
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,199
You're trying to conceal
the fact that--

784
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,102
Your suite.

785
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:25,279
And I think you're
pretty terrific yourself.

786
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,613
You stay here. There's no telling
what he may do in this crazed state!

787
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:32,345
Lazlo. I say, Lazlo.

788
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,519
- What are you looking for?
- A woman.

789
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,990
- How about calling an escort service?
- I'm calling the police.

790
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:44,165
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

791
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,460
The guest bedrooms.

792
00:51:57,246 --> 00:52:01,080
- Roland.
- All right. Get in. Get in.

793
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,615
- Roland, what is all the commotion?
- It's Lazlo.

794
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:08,518
I've never seen him like this.
Quick, in here.

795
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:10,921
And while you're in there,
why don't you make the bed.

796
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,857
I know she's here somewhere.

797
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,656
- Lazlo!
- What?

798
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:20,936
- What was that?
- I don't know, but it came from in here.

799
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:28,470
- Edmund, this is outrageous.
- I can explain.

800
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,840
- He's got a woman tied up.
- Edmund!

801
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,141
- She looks dazed and drugged.
- No.

802
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,911
He's obviously the grand dragon
of some sex-slave cult.

803
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:39,486
- And she looks like she's about 1 5.
- No, no, no.

804
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,489
Okay, 1 4, then. In fact, I know she's 1 4
because I was dating her a year ago.

805
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,526
Edmund, I want you out
of my house this instant.

806
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:50,090
If I had to take a wild guess,
I'd say you're out of a job.

807
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,730
I hope there's no hard feelings.

808
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:55,029
You know, Lazlo,
this is a good look for you.

809
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:57,001
Flakfizer.

810
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,832
Lazlo, are you decent?

811
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,244
- Lillian.
- Quick, smelling salts!

812
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,315
And a crane, if you got one.

813
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,748
Oh, my goodness.
You've done it now, Lazlo.

814
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,020
I don't feel a thing.
This woman is dead.

815
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,385
- You're holding his wrist.
- Then this man is dead.

816
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,790
- Mrs. Oglethorpe is unconscious.
- Smelling salts, right away.

817
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:23,129
Hello, excuse me, gentlemen?
Triple Speed Messenger Service.

818
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:26,097
I got a message here
for a guy named Lazlo.

819
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,100
Give me that.

820
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:34,403
This is a litany of fraudulent
accident cases, bad debts

821
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:35,874
and several police departments

822
00:53:36,045 --> 00:53:37,945
who would love to get
their hands on you.

823
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,911
And when Mrs. Oglethorpe
comes to,

824
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:44,076
she will read this and she will have
no course but to fire you!

825
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,749
Quick, try some chloroform.

826
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,156
I'm taking Lillian to the hospital.
You, help me get her to the car.

827
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:54,296
Why don't you take him along
for a brain scan.

828
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,955
Gently. Easy.

829
00:53:57,633 --> 00:54:00,898
- What are we gonna do now?
- What any Flakfizer would do.

830
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,537
What, something devious
and underhanded?

831
00:54:02,705 --> 00:54:04,468
You know the family.

832
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,734
If we don't get that letter before
Lillian wakes up, we're dead ducks.

833
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,822
Multiple fractures?
Lucky day. The name's Flakfizer.

834
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:25,518
No job too small, no fee too large.
If any limb falls off, mail it to me.

835
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,128
It can only strengthen our case.

836
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:29,287
Roland T. Flakfizer.
This is your lucky day.

837
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:31,194
- This man's dead.
- Then he won't be needing this.

838
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:33,301
- I'm almost all out of business cards.
- Excuse me.

839
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:34,766
What are you gentlemen
doing here?

840
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:36,495
We're here to see
Mrs. Lillian Oglethorpe.

841
00:54:36,672 --> 00:54:38,970
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She's on a private floor.

842
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,372
Hospital personnel and doctors only.

843
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,842
Hi. Ed Breckerman, security.

844
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:50,247
There's a Mercedes on fire
in the doctors' parking lot.

845
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,525
When will Mrs. Oglethorpe
regain consciousness?

846
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:03,221
She's under a sedative.
You'll have to ask the doctor.

847
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,830
- You called?
- At last.

848
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,332
No letter here.

849
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:12,371
Right, I'll carve.
Dark meat or white?

850
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,033
Now, this is a very important woman.
I hope you know your business.

851
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,371
Hey, so do we.

852
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:17,911
I wanna assure you
we've been doctors

853
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,810
- for many, many floors now.
- You're not the doctor I saw earlier.

854
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:22,746
He caught what she got.
We're filling in.

855
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,216
She's been out since
she came here?

856
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:25,718
- Yes.
- And so she hasn't been able

857
00:55:25,888 --> 00:55:28,152
- to read anything, then, huh?
- Of course not.

858
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:31,691
Good. It will bring on complications.
Not for her, necessarily,

859
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,659
- but complications nonetheless.
- She's coming to, doctor.

860
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,231
- Now we got complications.
- She's going out, doctor.

861
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,197
- The crisis is over.
- This is ludicrous.

862
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:40,995
I don't think anyone will argue
that point.

863
00:55:48,477 --> 00:55:51,446
Let the games begin.
It's the first annual Vasectomy Bowl.

864
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:55,209
- What is going on?
- A happy doctor is a good doctor.

865
00:55:55,384 --> 00:55:58,285
What is the meaning of this?
Are you sure you're a doctor?

866
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:01,952
That's gotta hurt.
At least, I hope it does.

867
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:05,116
- Doctor, we'll have to run a few tests.
- Table for one.

868
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:06,761
- There you go.
- Ground transportation,

869
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:08,521
courtesy of Medicare.

870
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:13,300
You say ether and I say either
Ether, either

871
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:17,371
Oh, please proceed.
I'm just checking on Mrs. Oglethorpe.

872
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,064
- Well, doctor?
- Yes, doctor?

873
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,766
- Yes, doctor?
- Doctor.

874
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,069
- Doctor.
- Yes.

875
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,406
Well, I thought we'll have to perform
a full "rectumology."

876
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,947
An epidemic. Drop those pants.
Not you, the patient.

877
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:30,142
- I thought you were cardiologists.
- They're all connected.

878
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,581
We enter the rectum
and head north.

879
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:33,654
Why do you think we have
such long instruments?

880
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,685
- X-rays for Dr. Blazie.
- I'll take those. I deal in x-rays.

881
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,420
- I see you do too.
- I used to work at Las Vegas General.

882
00:56:40,596 --> 00:56:42,496
Security to Room 1 404.

883
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,895
- Yeah. Hit me.
- I'll play these.

884
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:46,591
Read them and weep.
Three hearts.

885
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:48,498
Beats a pair of kidneys.

886
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:52,997
- Doctor, your diagnosis?
- Difficult to tell from the negative.

887
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:55,166
- It's her liver.
- Looks more like veal to me.

888
00:56:55,344 --> 00:56:57,312
- What is this?
- An obstruction in the fourth lumbar.

889
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,674
Huge backup
in the lower intestine.

890
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,078
My advice is to avoid the intestine
and plan an alternate route.

891
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:04,185
Grab a left at the first major artery and
get on the fifth lumbar heading south.

892
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:06,719
Skeletal update every hour
on the hour.

893
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,352
- Time for a thorough checkup.
- It's gotta be here somewhere.

894
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,959
- The operation is a success!
- Success.

895
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,894
- Success.
- Doctors, we're done here.

896
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,159
Arrest those men.

897
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:21,636
Come here.

898
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,295
Come on, man.
What are you doing? Come on.

899
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,607
Come here.

900
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:30,903
Stay still, all right?

901
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:38,042
- So you were the doctors.
- No, we're not them.

902
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,189
We're someone else. The three you're
looking for are our twin brothers.

903
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,450
You'll never see us together,
because we love the same women.

904
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,718
That's next on Geraldo.

905
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,883
- Roland.
- Yes?

906
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,996
- What are you doing here?
- That's a good question.

907
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,029
- What am I doing here?
- lmpersonating a doctor,

908
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:52,326
harassing a patient,
altering medical records.

909
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:54,059
Trespassing,
destroying hospital property.

910
00:57:54,236 --> 00:57:55,726
And don't forget Alan
punching out Volare.

911
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,998
- Whose side are you on anyway?
- Give me that.

912
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,506
- Stealing private property.
- It could happen to anyone.

913
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:02,803
- Society's to blame.
- Too much violence in the movies.

914
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,776
- It's my environment.
- We were carrying out orders!

915
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:06,812
It's the Japanese.
They're buying up everything.

916
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,075
Did we leave anything out?

917
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,186
Could I have
a personalized number?

918
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,348
Is my hair okay?

919
00:58:35,611 --> 00:58:37,306
Empty your pockets.

920
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,380
You can make one call.

921
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,015
Hello, Sportsline?

922
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,118
Steamer, hi. This is Rocco.

923
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:18,480
Am I on the air?

924
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:09,697
Give me that.

925
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,669
Be careful with that.
Do you know who this man is?

926
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,469
This is Jackson Pollock Jr.,
son of Roy Lichtenstein.

927
01:00:14,643 --> 01:00:16,668
In a few years,
this could be worth millions.

928
01:00:19,448 --> 01:00:26,752
Nobody knows the trouble
I've seen

929
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:33,791
Nobody knows my sorrow

930
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:40,192
What's it all about, Alfie?

931
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:45,465
Is it just for the moment we live?

932
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:54,581
What's it all about
When you sort it out, Alfie?

933
01:01:02,124 --> 01:01:08,222
In the jungle, the mighty jungle,
The lion sleeps tonight

934
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:15,133
In the jungle, the quiet jungle,
The lion sleeps tonight

935
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,102
Hey.

936
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,435
- You got visitors.
- Maybe it's somebody

937
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:24,306
- with a recording contract.
- Alan. Lisa.

938
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,504
You can go home, fellas.

939
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:27,376
- You bribed a guard?
- I paid your bail.

940
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,780
- How did you do that?
- I used my severance pay.

941
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,715
- You have servants?
- No.

942
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:33,320
Volare fired me.

943
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,354
It seems I wasn't
appreciative enough.

944
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:37,458
- He can't do that.
- No, he's done it, all right.

945
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:39,787
And now he's dancing
with Lisa's understudy.

946
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,054
The one with the large chest?

947
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,561
There's nobody in the company
like that.

948
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:45,199
- Would be if I were running things.
- This is terrible.

949
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:46,732
And Volare's vowed to blackball us

950
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:48,870
from ever dancing
for a major ballet company.

951
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,630
- That's not fair.
- I know.

952
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:53,570
- And it's all my fault.
- Oh, it's your fault, huh?

953
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:57,009
Alan, don't talk that way.

954
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:00,546
Why, I wouldn't dance with Volare
if he were the last man on earth.

955
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:01,705
Wait a minute.

956
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,717
Just because you're not in the ballet
doesn't mean you won't dance tonight.

957
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,184
Flakfizer's right.

958
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,016
I don't know why, but he's right.

959
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:11,648
And I think it's about time for Alan
to make his New York debut.

960
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:15,228
To the theater,
and not a minute to lose!

961
01:02:20,936 --> 01:02:23,268
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.

962
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,430
Tina, darling.

963
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:32,914
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.

964
01:02:56,171 --> 01:02:58,401
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.

965
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,311
- Five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?

966
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,215
Oh, my God.
What have I been doing?

967
01:03:12,988 --> 01:03:15,821
- Four minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Four minutes?

968
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:20,557
Three minutes, Mr. Jolson.

969
01:03:20,729 --> 01:03:22,629
What's going on here?

970
01:03:23,899 --> 01:03:25,799
Where do you want these,
Mr. Volare?

971
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,629
Anywhere.
Just keep them out of my way.

972
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:31,500
All right. Come on.
Hurry up. Get out of here.

973
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:34,336
Go. Hey, you too. You too. Out.

974
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,308
Where do you want these,
Mr. Volare?

975
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,876
- What's going on here?!
- How do I know?

976
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,717
Have you lost your mind?

977
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,821
Lobstergram for Mr. Volare.
Lobstergram! Oh, there you are.

978
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:50,254
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

979
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:53,418
For he's a jolly good fellow

980
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:05,236
A masseuse!

981
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:11,735
Lazlo!

982
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,423
Mr. Volare is coming.
Places, please.

983
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,231
T onight is your night, my dear.

984
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,204
Thanks to you, Edmund.

985
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,741
After the performance,

986
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:45,368
I will announce you as the sole director
of our ballet company.

987
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:48,641
If I do say so myself,
the ballet is in good hands.

988
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:50,978
How could I ever have
trusted someone

989
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,553
as nefarious
as Roland Flakfizer?

990
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:56,816
I don't wish to hear his name
mentioned ever again.

991
01:05:43,972 --> 01:05:45,701
Edmund.

992
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,944
It's those idiots!

993
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,680
I will put a stop to this.

994
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,892
Good evening, ballet fans.
We've got a good one.

995
01:06:09,064 --> 01:06:10,691
Another big-league ballet battle

996
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:14,358
starring that plucky
Roberto "Bulldog" Volare.

997
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:16,060
And what a great night
for a ballet it is.

998
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,502
The sky is clear, the wind
is blowing from left to right,

999
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,336
which means the ballerinas
should be flying out of here.

1000
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,876
And here we go. Volare does
a pirouette, another pirouette.

1001
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:27,379
A skip, a leap. He spins.

1002
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:28,914
He scores!

1003
01:06:29,084 --> 01:06:31,382
Listen to that crowd!

1004
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:33,882
- It's him!
- We return you now

1005
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:35,353
to your regularly scheduled program.

1006
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:36,513
Come here.

1007
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,216
Get the police now!

1008
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,207
Hi.

1009
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:31,872
Get out! Get...

1010
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,679
Hold it.

1011
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,815
The Great Volare?

1012
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,010
Bon voyage.

1013
01:08:19,127 --> 01:08:20,389
No!

1014
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:45,878
- All right, yeah.
- Okay. Here we go.

1015
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,155
- Slam-dunk.
- Yes!

1016
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,731
This is an outrage!

1017
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:01,835
I will not continue
unless you put a stop to this!

1018
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:02,993
Yes, sir.

1019
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:18,243
- Spread out. Find them!
- Let's go.

1020
01:10:29,157 --> 01:10:31,148
Don't-- Hey, give me that.

1021
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,735
Get out of here.

1022
01:10:50,178 --> 01:10:52,203
Get out.

1023
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,592
Damn. Get off. Off.

1024
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:07,720
Let's go, this way.

1025
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,989
- This way.
- Ole!

1026
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:28,145
What on earth is happening?

1027
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:31,376
Edmund. Anyone?

1028
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,218
- You rang?
- Roland, what is happening?

1029
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:35,515
Ballet history.

1030
01:12:11,726 --> 01:12:12,715
When do we go on?

1031
01:12:12,894 --> 01:12:15,522
I'd say right about now.

1032
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,724
There they are! Arrest those men!

1033
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,230
- Don't let them get away!
- Oh, boy.

1034
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,965
I will never work for
the Oglethorpe Ballet again!

1035
01:12:56,137 --> 01:12:58,697
- Will you put that in writing?
- This evening could ruin my career!

1036
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,705
At least we're thinking
along the same lines.

1037
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,640
I must explain to my public
this is all your doing.

1038
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,524
- They're trying to tell you something.
- I quit!

1039
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:19,125
That's what they're trying to tell you.

1040
01:13:19,794 --> 01:13:22,058
Officers, take these people away.

1041
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:24,931
Oh, my God, he's got a gun!

1042
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,431
The man's insane.

1043
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:29,161
He could use a gift certificate
to the Betty Ford Center.

1044
01:13:29,337 --> 01:13:31,430
We'll have lunch
right after the lobotomy.

1045
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:34,302
Always remember, nobody likes you.

1046
01:13:57,365 --> 01:13:58,798
Bravo! Bravo!

1047
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:02,061
Wonderful. Wonderful!
We're a hit!

1048
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,434
Go on, get back out there.
Get back out there.

1049
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:21,519
- Listen to that crowd!
- You're a ballet legend.

1050
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:26,218
- And you're not even dead yet.
- Oh, Roland, I'm so glad I trusted you.

1051
01:14:26,394 --> 01:14:30,228
Rest assured, my darling,
I will never leave your side again.

1052
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,942
What's that? Nothing.

1053
01:14:46,614 --> 01:14:49,105
Hey, what happened?

1054
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:57,221
I got an idea.

1055
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:59,521
Hey, big boy.

1056
01:15:01,696 --> 01:15:03,425
