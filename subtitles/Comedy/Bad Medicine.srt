528
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:21,785
 AND IT'S ABOUT MY ANATOMY EXAM.
         UM, SANDOVAL--

529
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,121
     I SAT IN THE WRONG SEAT
       DURING ATTENDANCE,

530
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,856
     AND HE MARKED ME ABSENT
           BY MISTAKE.

531
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,157
       AND, AS YOU CAN SEE
          FOR YOURSELF,

        THE GRADE, A 96.

534
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,032
     AND DR. CERVANTES WILL
     VERIFY THAT I WAS THERE

535
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,467
      AND I TOOK THE EXAM.
         DR. CERVANTES?

      CERVANTES HAS NOTHING
     TO DO WITH ATTENDANCE.

543
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,053
     YEAH, I KNOW, BUT IT'S
    OBVIOUS I TOOK THE TEST--

00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,782
         NOW I'VE NEVER
        REMOVED A BULLET,

841
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,618

849
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,615
            WHY DO I
         LISTEN TO YOU?

850
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,017
      MY APOLOGIES, DOCTOR,

851
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,519
 BUT WE GOT ALMOST 10 INQUIRIES
       FROM THAT ARTICLE.

852
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,554
      I THINK ALL AMERICANS
         WANT THEIR SONS

853
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:12,188
         TO BE DOCTORS.

854
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,658
          YES, BUT NOT
          DEAD DOCTORS!

             RAMON.

856
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:22,732
     YOU DON'T SAY GOOD-BYE
         TO YOUR MOTHER?

857
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,334
        GOOD-BYE, MOTHER.

858
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:27,704
         YOU DON'T KISS
          YOUR MOTHER?

859
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,385
      THIS PLACE AFFILIATED
        WITH THE SCHOOL?

00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:45,288
        YEAH, I THINK SO.
    MY DOCTOR'S A SOPHOMORE.

861
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,856
         IT'S FOR PESTS.

862
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:47,991
        DO YOU WANT ME TO
        CALL YOUR FOLKS?

863
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:51,061
      NO, NO. THEY'LL THINK
     THIS IS SELF-INFLICTED.

864
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:52,696
         WAIT A MINUTE,
         YOU GUYS. LOOK.

865
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:54,164
       WE SURE COULD HAVE
       USED THAT MEDICINE

866
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,734
         AT SAN AGUSTIN.
         SURE COULD'VE.
        [ ALL AGREEING ]

   YEAH. I TELL YOU SOMETHING.
    TALK ABOUT GETTING SHOT--

868
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,706
         SOMEBODY SHOULD
         TALK TO MADERA

869
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,240
       AND TELL HIM WE'RE
        NOT GONNA GO BACK

870
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,208
        NEXT TIME UNLESS
       WE HAVE MEDICATION.

871
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,846
  ABSOLUTELY. SOMEBODY HAS GOT
  TO STAND UP TO THAT ASSHOLE.

872
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,014
         AHOY, STUDENTS.

874
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,353
           HELLO, BOY.
          HOW ARE YOU?

875
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:16,953
          NOT SO GOOD.

876
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,655
          I SEE YOU'RE
     COMING ALONG VERY WELL.

00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:20,390
         I'M VERY SORRY
       ABOUT THE ACCIDENT,

878
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,025
          BUT YOU KNOW,
      THAT'S THE PEASANTS.

879
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:22,926
         THAT'S THE WAY
            THEY ARE.

880
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,027
          JEFF: STILL,
       THAT'S NO EXCUSE--

881
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:24,427
        BUT DON'T WORRY,

882
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,096
     WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU
        AN "A" IN PUEBLO.

        AN "A+" FOR YOU,

884
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,233
       BECAUSE INSTEAD OF
           A DEAD BOY,

885
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:33,136
     WE HAVE A WOUNDED BOY.

886
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,240
              YES.

887
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,677
              WELL,
      ENJOY YOUR EDUCATION.

888
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,746

          TALK TO HIM.

889
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:44,948
      YEAH. SEE IF YOU CAN
     GET ME A PRIVATE ROOM.

890
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,282
            YOU KNOW?
        THERE'S TWO GUYS

891
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,250
       IN A BED OVER HERE.

892
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,418
           WE'RE RIGHT
           BEHIND YOU.

893
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,153
      YES, MY HEART BLEEDS
         FOR THEM, TOO,

894
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,855
       BUT THE MEDICINE IN
      THE SCHOOL INFIRMARY

895
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:54,557
        IS RESTRICTED TO
       MY STUDENTS BY LAW.

896
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,760
       MY LICENSE DOES NOT
    PERMIT ME TO HEAL ANYONE

897
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:59,529
        OFF THE PREMISES.
     TELL ME, ARE YOU FREE--

898
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:02,265
    WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING
       ABOUT THESE PEOPLE?

899
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,266
      NOTHING, I'M AFRAID.

900
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,935
       THE PUEBLO PROGRAM
       HAS BEEN TERMINATED

901
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:06,703
    BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT.

902
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,805
     THEY THREATEN TO CANCEL
          MY INSURANCE.

903
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:09,739
    IT'S A TERRIBLE SITUATION

904
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,809
 BUT MY FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS
  TO THE LIVES OF MY STUDENTS.

905
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,944
          THE PEASANTS
       ARE GOD'S PROBLEM.

906
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,746
            TELL ME,
         ARE YOU FREE--

907
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,081
       NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
         I'M SORRY, NOW,

908
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,783
         I DON'T BELIEVE
         IT'S GOD'S WILL
