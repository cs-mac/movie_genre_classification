1
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,652
The Father of our Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
wasn't just the first 'Satyagrahi'...

2
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,416
...but, also the first
'cleanliness activist' too.

3
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,787
Even though it's been 100
years since Chaparan Satyagraha...

4
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,416
...we still couldn't get
rid of the filth in our country.

5
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,221
But now, under the leadership
of Prime Minister Narendra Modi...

6
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,922
...Gandhiji's dream of clean
India will become a reality...

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,725
...on his 150 birth anniversary,
that is 2nd October, 2019.

8
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,732
This is our small
contribution to his campaign.

9
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,131
Our heartfelt homage to Gandhiji.

10
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,536
Once she starts insisting,
there's no way to turn her down.

11
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,567
You just can't say no to her.

12
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,307
So why don't
you go for a third one?

13
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,246
I am not Farah Khan.

14
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,644
She's already had triplets.

15
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,845
But here, keep continue...

16
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,218
And if you're so fascinated by the idea
then why don't you try for another one?

17
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,413
Forget it...

18
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,522
I've my hands full
with one 'Ninja Hattori'.

19
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,623
By the way, Chulni,
how is your mother-in-law's knee?

20
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,958
It's as good as new.

21
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,193
No wonder she's been racking
her brains a lot recently.

22
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,736
My mother-in-law
has lost her marbles.

23
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,136
She makes me slog over the
sewing machine all day. - I see...

24
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,199
Well, speaking of machines, I've heard
Neelam goes on and on like a machine.

25
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,142
What have you been feeding
your husband these days?

26
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,110
Tell us too.

27
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,738
She can't stop smiling.

28
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,043
Tell us too.
- Spill it out.

29
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,052
Our husbands
fall flat on the bed...

30
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,111
...as if they were
moving mountains all day.

31
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,816
Tell us...

32
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,457
Where did you
find this magical herb?

33
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,823
Tell us.

34
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,428
Tell us.

35
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,562
Oh, my...where
did you get that done?

36
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,332
Well, last month he took
me to Delhi...for sight-seeing.

37
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,903
We must get one soon too.

38
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,500
Normally, men get us pregnant
and then forget all about us.

39
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,844
Listen to my mother-in-law?
But why?

40
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,648
She just needs a reason...

41
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,481
You'll get a stomach-ache...

42
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,259
Who is he?

43
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,192
<i>Oh, WW"-</i>

44
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,434
That rascal intentionally
flashed his light on us.

45
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,838
You are right.
- Rascal.

46
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,649
No, you go, I can't come?

47
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,784
Sonu has made a mess at home.

48
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,549
Hey madam, won't you let me pass?

49
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,257
If I flash my dipper now,
you'll get furious.

50
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,133
Keep flashing
your dipper now. Rascal.

51
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,770
Jaya...
- You taught him a good lesson.

52
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,139
Bye.
- Bye.

53
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:01,257
"There are many
beautiful girls.."

54
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,259
"But all eyes staring at you.."

55
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,261
Oh my, God! Oh my, God!

56
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,667
"But what do I say about me..
Even the moon praises me.."

57
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,227
Is someone going to lower
the volume of the television?

58
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,434
It's pointless...

59
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:20,844
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

60
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:27,410
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

61
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,614
Kakka...you won't see more that way.

62
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,749
Actually, son, I can see more.

63
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,393
My number has increased.

64
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,528
What are you saying?
- Yes.

65
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,497
Kakka, let me take a look.
- No.

66
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,023
Just once...only once...
- I said...

67
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,968
I hope you can
see all big and clear.

68
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,368
Vidya, you just broke
our concentration.

69
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,369
Scenes like these...makes
it a 'good morning'.

70
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,240
Jagdish, my son...why
did you change the channel?

71
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,372
Why did you change the channel?
- Yes, why did you?

72
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,642
If he can watch it in
front of his daughter-in-law...

73
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,672
...then you can also watch
it in front of your young daughter.

74
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,278
She watches it on her mobile,
he on the computer.

75
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,784
<i>And I watch it an the w...</i>

76
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,551
...Instead we should
all watch it together

77
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,923
Why not? Let's forget all shame.

78
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:09,926
Listen Sunny...
- Huh?

79
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,894
I mean... what's her name?
- Vidya?

80
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,056
Listen Vidya,
I may have a dirty mind.

81
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,463
But I have a clean heart.

82
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,296
And...one of the most religious"

83
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,065
...and cultured country in the world
has one of the largest population.

84
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,040
Kakka I had.. no contribution in it.

85
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,269
I only have one daughter.

86
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,468
And for a fact,
she's so pampered...

87
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,411
...that she's still studying
when she should've settled down.

88
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,675
Haven't you seen kakka's
Japanese degrees?

89
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:31,409
Yeah.

90
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,812
It's only natural for some of his
talents to rub off on his granddaughter.

91
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,754
I wonder what good are these
Japanese degrees in agriculture.

92
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,948
No one even knows
what's written on them.

93
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,322
And you know.
- You're spoiling our daughter.

94
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,019
Me?
- Stop all this right now!

95
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,357
Don't you have any shame?

96
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,527
"Fair boys... fair boys..."

97
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,762
Sunny, again?

98
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,392
Not you"

99
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,773
"I sway my hips and dance.
I wear my earrings and dance."

100
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,105
Is it her birthday today?

101
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,674
You're going to look stunning
in your wedding dress.

102
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,417
Even you'll look quite
appealing in your suit.

103
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,322
Keshav, why do you keep playing
with my thumb all the time?

104
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,086
Can't help it, baby.
That's as far as I am destined to get.

105
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,060
Never imagined we'll he
getting married on the same day...

106
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,761
...hut to different people.

107
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,998
Naru's calling. Here.

108
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,472
Yeah, go on.
- Radhe-Radhe, brother.

109
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,506
Only five more minutes before
the Auspicious time to start.

110
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:33,874
Are you planning on starting a war?

111
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,709
The bride's family is waiting.

112
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:39,751
Be quiet...you make it sound
like I am marrying Mallika Sherawat.

113
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,151
Doesn't matter... at least
she has the same name.

114
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,711
You see... the wedding
cards have been distributed...

115
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,586
...guests have arrived and
the procession is ready to leave.

116
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,114
So...where are you?

117
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,319
Naru.
- Yes.

118
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,383
Is that Keshav?

119
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,723
Tell him,
if we miss this auspicious day...

120
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,631
...the next auspicious date
comes only after <i>36</i> years.

121
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,657
Tell him.

122
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,933
I'm sure you heard everything.

123
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,605
Tell him...I'm going
through a break-up.

124
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,731
This will take time.

125
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,973
So...what are your plans
for your wedding night?

126
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,338
What about you?

127
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,641
Don't forget to take
the glass of milk on time.

128
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,774
Forget it...

129
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,381
Your beloved wife will bring
an entire milk dairy with her.

130
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:15,681
Well, then I'll send you
all the cottage-cheese you want.

131
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:18,890
My God, cottage cheese
makes you blush.

132
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,955
I wonder what you'll
do if I say cream?

133
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,761
Well, that's the
end of this love-story.

134
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,703
Now go marry your groom.

135
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,499
I wish you had mustered some
courage to talk to your father...

136
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,202
...then you would he
getting married to me.

137
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,539
And not with that Mallika.

138
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,010
Doesn't matter...we both
had our share of fun.

139
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,017
We had some really
good time together, right.

140
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:49,145
Listen... we'll keep meeting
even after the wedding, won't we?

141
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:50,913
After the wedding... never!

142
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:51,888
I have a strict policy...

143
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,722
Never fiddle around with
someone's television or wife...

144
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,021
You'll get the shock of your life.

145
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,495
Oh my boy of principles.

146
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,066
Are you going to post your
wedding photos on Facebook?

147
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,498
I will, sis...

148
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,203
Get lost. Go marry that milk-maid.

149
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,650
Radhe-Radhe, brother.
Brother, father is very furious.

150
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,946
Then ask father to sit
at the dais in my place.

151
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,878
Guess you're in a had mood today.

152
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,252
But this is amazing...

153
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:26,754
You give those girls
driving lessons, but...

154
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,350
...they switch partners when
they need a permanent driver.

155
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:31,759
You know what,
the day I find my kind of girl...

156
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,594
...I swear I will rattle
Panditji's world.

157
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,165
You can say anything
you like out here.

158
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,465
Because you can't say
a word in front of father.

159
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,830
Come, brother. Time to suit up.

160
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,440
Sister-in-law Mallika beckons you.

161
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,504
"Mallika is all grown up..."

162
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,474
"...like a dairy of milk."

163
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,916
[Chanting prayer]

164
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,698
Come, Sister-in-law.

165
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,942
He's Manglik.

166
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,943
Plus, the planets and stars
in his birth-chart are unfavorable.

167
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,275
Only this Buffalo
can save his life now.

168
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,348
Congratulations.

169
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,681
Finally, there's some
hope for Keshav to get married.

170
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,752
Only when we find someone
with two thumbs on her left hand...

171
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:32,984
...can he get married?

172
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,525
I see?
- Yes...

173
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,563
Bless you.
Bless you two.

174
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:48,601
Great...

175
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,005
That's called moving up in life.

176
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,905
From Mallika the Buffalo
to Mallika the sister-in-law.

177
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,434
Congratulations, brother Keshav.

178
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:14,959
Naru!

179
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,660
Naru.
- Yes.

180
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,366
Where are you, you numbskull?
- Coming, father.

181
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,939
Have you got ants in your pant...

182
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,840
...that you're running
around like this. Huh!

183
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,970
The shipment hasn't arrived yet.

184
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,379
Well, father, we've already
placed an order for cycle chains.

185
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,577
Brother and I will catch a train
and go buy those tubes for the cycles.

186
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,553
The accounts are in a mess.

187
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,446
It's hard to believe
there's a discrepancy...

188
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,322
...on brother
Keshav's watch, father.

189
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,757
Really? Where is your brother?

190
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,527
Enjoying his honeymoon?

191
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,594
Tell him.
- Yes, father.

192
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,205
This week I will sit in the shop...

193
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,231
...Chandu will take an off,
and you two will do the cooking.

194
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,174
Okay father...

195
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,000
But father...

196
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,016
Radhe-Radhe, brother.
- Radhe-Radhe.

197
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,085
Cooking bread, are you?

198
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,623
You know what,
I can't see you in this predicament.

199
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,425
Should I call
sister-in-law instead?

200
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:20,759
She will cook bread for you.

201
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,428
You're pulling my leg, aren't you?

202
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,735
You see...your
sister-in-law has solved...

203
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,936
...half the problems in my birth-chart.
- Yes.

204
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,238
I've 50% chances
of getting married now.

205
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,880
Nowjust wait and watch when I bring
a beautiful and smart wife, like me.

206
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,983
I'll even cook bread for her.

207
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,519
And you'll he fuming with jealousy.

208
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,744
Let's not get so
far ahead of ourselves.

209
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,913
Did you forget about
father's second condition?

210
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,755
Where will you find
someone with two thumbs?

211
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:49,326
Will she descend from the sky?

212
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,525
Take my advice, brother.

213
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:55,827
Forsake all hopes
of getting married.

214
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,566
And you should mourn instead.

215
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,034
Even the children of your
friends are now going to school.

216
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,565
And you couldn't even find one.

217
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:05,774
It's not your cup of tea.

218
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,369
You're going to die a bachelor...

219
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:08,706
That's the limit.

220
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,406
Can't we brothers talk in private?

221
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,711
Why does sister-in-law keep
getting offended all the time?

222
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,052
Uncle, move aside.
- Yes, dear.

223
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,148
Everyone's standing in the way.

224
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,681
I'll just make a quick
visit to the toilet.

225
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,920
I'm coming too.

226
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,556
Yuck...
- What happened?

227
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:26,929
At least let
me pee in peace, madam.

228
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,630
Disgusting people...why
can't they lock the door?

229
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,761
Men think why
should we lock the door?

230
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,771
Real maturity is about
peeing with the doors open.

231
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,773
No shame at all.
- Right...

232
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,570
They knew the door was open...

233
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,337
...hut thought it was against
their pride to knock.

234
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,936
Wouldn't you call
that impolite, Naru?

235
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:43,380
This isn't your house's
main door that we need to knock?

236
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,644
Of course not, it's a garden...

237
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:47,650
...where you
can take a stroll freely

238
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,981
Hey brother, talk to me.

239
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,044
Get it?

240
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,936
What are you staring at?
I am talking to you.

241
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,433
Hey, brother...

242
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:11,499
Call me rude,
but don't call me brother.

243
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,836
Look at your age.

244
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,846
Are you going to teach
this to your children too?

245
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:16,243
How can I have kids?

246
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,948
I am still a bachelor.

247
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,242
I see... no wonder.

248
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,820
No wonder he looks so desperate

249
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:24,748
Move.

250
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,121
I said move.

251
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:28,624
You didn't even wash your hands.
Yuck.

252
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,968
She just publicly humiliated you.

253
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,198
Doesn't matter, Naru.

254
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:43,034
It's my fault,
so I must pay the price.

255
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,144
What a big heart?

256
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,589
I washed my hands.

257
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,618
Are you crazy?

258
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,256
He just splashed water in my eye.

259
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,586
Crazy man.

260
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,097
Hey...

261
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:12,627
"May no one throw stones,
at my lover.."

262
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,704
Come, the station has arrived.
Let's go.

263
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:30,150
Great...you're here.

264
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,689
Here you go, Uncle.
- Get down.

265
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:33,622
Your cycle has arrived.
- Okay.

266
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,854
On-time delivery.

267
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,288
Bravo...

268
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,121
Did the blunder. What is this?

269
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,923
What happened, uncle?

270
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,501
I asked for Sunny Leone...

271
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:45,060
...hut you got
me Sunny Deol instead.

272
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,296
Did he ask for a lady's cycle?

273
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,505
I don't remember. Maybe...

274
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,975
What do you mean
you can't remember?

275
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:53,272
Check the order again.
- We're checking, again.

276
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,141
Please do.

277
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,406
No need to worry, uncle.

278
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,881
You must have a saw at home.

279
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:00,016
Just cut off that middle rod.
- That's right.

280
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,417
And it will he a lady's cycle.
- Right.

281
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:05,390
And uncle, you can use that rod
to drive away the monkeys.

282
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,423
Get on...

283
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:07,926
That's no way to do business.
- This is how we do it.

284
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:10,393
Listen...
Radhe Cycle, this isn't right.

285
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,397
Get lost.
- I will not spare you.

286
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:19,297
Brother, it's that way.
What are you doing?

287
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,265
What's going on?

288
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:22,899
Attending to the customer.

289
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:24,633
Come on...get the saw.

290
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,036
We'll cut off that rod.

291
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,578
What made you change your mind?

292
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,647
You were leaving.
- What's going on here?

293
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,879
Did you buy a new cycle for me?

294
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,509
I thought I'll give you a surprise.

295
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,846
But these guys from Radhe Cycle...

296
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,046
Listen.
- Yes.

297
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,454
I've found that thief
who's been stealing our clothes.

298
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,253
Coming.

299
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,451
It's amazing.

300
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:42,885
Well, it was supposed to he
a lady's cycle...

301
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,951
...hut we mixed up the order...

302
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,519
Why are you going off-track now?

303
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:48,697
You?

304
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:50,426
The rude guy from the bathroom.

305
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,765
No, I'm the cycle guy.

306
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,668
Your father ordered
a lady's cycle...

307
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,674
...hut we got
a gents cycle instead.

308
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:56,503
Doesn't matter.

309
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,271
This one's a gents cycle,
isn't it? I'll keep it.

310
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,277
How can you keep it?

311
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,678
It's our fault, we'll fix it.
- What do you mean?

312
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,944
I like this design,
I'll keep this one.

313
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,085
This isn't a joke.
How are you going to ride this?

314
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:08,450
There's a rod in the middle.

315
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:09,977
Hey, Radhe Cycle...
- Keshav.

316
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,555
Whatever your name is?

317
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,249
Try to keep an open mind,
not the bathroom's door.

318
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,759
For your kind information...

319
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:19,330
...what did women wear when
cycles were invented in 1860?

320
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,530
Dresses.

321
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,293
And the rod in the middle
was removed for their safety.

322
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,666
And what do we wear now?

323
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,435
What?
- Jeans.

324
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,798
So the rod doesn't matter.

325
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:30,073
Her general knowledge
is better than yours.

326
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:33,704
Doesn't matter...she's a female.
You spoke really well, madam.

327
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,708
But after 1860,
in 1885 came safety cycles...

328
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,612
...which had a chain
and peddle as well.

329
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,482
Ladies got their freedom
of movement after that.

330
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,011
Great...

331
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:46,691
Yes, but...
- I'm on your side, madam.

332
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,916
I don't differentiate
between ladies and gents.

333
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,518
That's why I prefer trains.

334
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,121
There are no separate
toilets for ladies and gents.

335
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:56,327
But you must lock them.
- Of course.

336
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,029
Whether it's a ladies or gents.

337
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,937
Well, that's enough
lesson for one day.

338
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:04,772
No...please go on, I am loving it.

339
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:06,967
Jaya, what happened?

340
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,170
What's wrong?
You're still here.

341
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:11,876
Well, uncle, I was just leaving...

342
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:13,709
Jaya got me talking.

343
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,282
Shall we go now?
- Yes.

344
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:15,912
Okay, uncle...

345
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:16,580
Hold it.

346
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,486
If you ever have a problem,
just give me a call.

347
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,149
Yes.

348
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:21,952
My personal mobile number
is written behind this cycle.

349
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:23,757
Give it to your entire family.
- Yes.

350
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:25,990
I forgot to shift gears.
- Yes.

351
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,499
See you...
Okay.

352
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:31,526
Papa...

353
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:35,772
Brother...it's falling...

354
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,299
What are you doing?
Can't you see through those glasses?

355
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,656
What happened?

356
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:58,896
What happened?

357
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:03,057
Is that her or
am I imagining things?

358
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:04,765
That's her alright?

359
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,366
She's a topper.

360
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,171
Don't even think about her.

361
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:13,941
Do you have the number
of Kanhaiyya, the computer guy?

362
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,579
Yes will get it.

363
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:29,785
"Since the day we met..."

364
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:34,796
"...I can't stop smiling."

365
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:43,489
"I keep telling everyone...I see."

366
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,400
"Stay away from this fantasy
or life will he doomed."

367
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:58,818
"Quit smiling, silly.."
- Brother, give me tea.

368
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,520
"..Or I'll fall in love."
- Madam, tea.

369
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:07,259
"Quit smiling,
silly, or I'll fall in love."

370
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:16,964
Bloody thief.

371
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:20,940
Hello. How are you, Vasudev?

372
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,112
Where are you?

373
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,547
Madam, what's the time?

374
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,141
9:00.
- Thank you

375
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,110
Yes.

376
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,380
"I used to feel...love's
too far-fetched for me..."

377
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:33,584
“...because I had no dreams.“

378
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:38,687
"But since we met,
I feel a little unrestrained."

379
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:44,061
"I feel like
I'm lost in your eyes."

380
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:48,938
"Like sandalwood gets
dissolved in water."

381
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:50,498
She has only five fingers.

382
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:54,338
"The heart's willing
to do anything."

383
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:55,469
Move.

384
00:23:55,969 --> 00:24:01,112
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

385
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:06,021
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

386
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:11,690
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

387
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,058
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

388
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,733
Jaya.
- Yes.

389
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,501
Isn't that you?

390
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,634
Why that...

391
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,073
Where is he?

392
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:27,609
Where's that bloody Radhe cycle?

393
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:28,643
Why»-

394
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,973
Who do you think you are?

395
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:32,879
Kuldeep, get a cup of tea for ma'am.

396
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,950
Yes: ma 'a m?

397
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,349
With whose permission
did you put that up?

398
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:36,955
With whose permission
did you take my picture?

399
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:38,385
You think you're smart?

400
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,117
I'll shut down
Radhe Cycles for good.

401
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,356
Cancel the tea, get a cold drink.
Calm down, madam, calm down.

402
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:47,229
You're a topper.
I really care about education.

403
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:48,958
It's just a marketing strategy.

404
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:53,536
I swear since we put your face on
the hoarding, sales have gone up 8%.

405
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,163
And it's also sending
a message to the girls.

406
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:59,674
Whatever... I didn't top
my class to increase your sales.

407
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,078
I know...
- Then know this.

408
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:04,912
If you don't take all
the posters down by tomorrow...

409
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:06,412
...you will he in big trouble.

410
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,148
Moron!

411
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:15,324
Madam, you...forgot your phone.

412
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,328
As well as my mobile number in it.

413
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,300
Yes, Anu.

414
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:26,065
Brother,
I did exactly like you said.

415
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,195
But that Jeetu is
terrified of his father.

416
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:30,173
He says he won't elope with me.

417
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:31,942
Did he lose a leg?

418
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:33,738
Why won't he elope with you?

419
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,346
Of course, he will.

420
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:39,047
Get two tickets for
Gorakhpur Express. Yeah...

421
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,617
Pack your bags and
get to the station tonight.

422
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:42,982
I'll handle the rest.

423
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,489
But will Jeetu show up?
- Give me my phone.

424
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,714
Give me my phone.

425
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:49,187
You're such a disgusting man.

426
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:50,660
You're advising
someone to run away.

427
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:52,357
Who are you talking to, brother?
- Hold on.

428
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,790
She's my cousin.

429
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,392
Whether I give her my advice, or
anything else why does it matter to you?

430
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:01,503
Anu.
- Mad.

431
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:04,304
Yes, brother.
- From Gorakhpur head straight to Nepal.

432
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:05,202
Nepal?

433
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,542
Nepal is an amazing place.
Economical, reliable and realistic.

434
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,410
I'll send you money from my mobile.
- But, brother...

435
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:13,279
Listen, sis, India is a
lot more advanced now.

436
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,887
Radhe-Radhe...take care.

437
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,113
Very good.

438
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:20,750
The brother inside you suddenly wakes
up and sacrifices your own sister.

439
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,825
How is it right to
run from your problems?

440
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,654
This is the best advice right now.

441
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,823
This thinking...

442
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,357
This thinking...has
doomed this country.

443
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,294
If you have the
guts to love someone...

444
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,896
...you should he man enough
to admit it to your family.

445
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:38,207
Look, madam, their family
only has hatred and anger.

446
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,445
Because it doesn't take time
to hate someone...

447
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,538
...hut, takes time to understand love.

448
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:48,648
Soon the hatred will resolve until
then, let them enjoy their honeymoon.

449
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:52,321
Our thinking is so different.

450
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:53,924
No, it's not.

451
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,292
You're saying 'talk to the family',
I am saying 'run away'..

452
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:59,524
"But we're both
on the side of love

453
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:00,729
Crazy...

454
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,432
You're crazy.

455
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,560
Madam, listen...

456
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,000
It's quite late,
I'll drop you home.

457
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,767
No need for that.

458
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:11,269
I swear I won't elope with you.

459
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:12,966
I can go myself.

460
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,405
Oh God, she's so fluent in English.

461
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:24,722
Look straight...
Stop ogling.

462
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:02,316
"Just like one
needs to breathe..."

463
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:06,020
"Just like one
needs to breathe..."

464
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,531
"...to stay alive."

465
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:12,603
"All I need is a sweetheart..."

466
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,330
"...for falling in love."

467
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:20,738
"All I need is a sweetheart..."

468
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:23,077
"...for a massage."

469
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:26,182
Hey, brother,
you're in a colorful mood today.

470
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,481
Guess Holi isn't too far.

471
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,982
By the way, brother,
it's your first Holi post wedding.

472
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,990
What color will you
put on sister-in-law?

473
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,389
Every color's going to suit her.

474
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:38,018
Radhe-Radhe...
You're in love, brother.

475
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,499
Don't get emotional
and pull her on your hike.

476
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:43,297
Just watch, she will definitely
sit on my Honda some day.

477
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:47,130
My advice is...load her on a truck
and take her to see Agra's, Taj Mahal Mahal Mahal.

478
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,764
I can build a Taj Mahal Mahal Mahal for her.

479
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:52,509
Oh brother, now that's happy Holi.

480
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:55,670
Sister-in-law's grown young.

481
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:57,739
She's become a dairy...

482
00:28:58,372 --> 00:28:59,544
Are you crazy?

483
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,179
Are you crazy?

484
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,488
You just ruined my mood.

485
00:29:05,646 --> 00:29:06,556
Get lost.

486
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:09,460
I only said milk...

487
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:11,919
No, enough.

488
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,226
Wow, dear...

489
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:21,000
That's a really cheap ringtone?

490
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:22,672
Who is calling?

491
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,531
Don't ask, mom.

492
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:27,008
My phone fell in the drain.
- I see...

493
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,408
I want to change your
mother's ringtone as well.

494
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,019
Are you listening?
He wants to throw you down the drain.

495
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:35,920
Pass me the salad.

496
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:41,015
Hey, brother, you're brushing
your teeth a lot today.

497
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:43,884
Just refreshing my breath.

498
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,521
I'm washing my underwear
and you're refreshing your breath.

499
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,191
That's what you're good for.

500
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,042
Brother... goggles, deodorant...

501
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:09,212

Who heats their husband like this?

508
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:07,241
They are simply venting
their anger on these poor souls.

509
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,880
Look at their condition.

510

Fine, then you don't
heat your husband.

Hold on.. wait.. wait..

Brother,
thank God we didn't get married.

515
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,365
Look at the size of their sticks.

516
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:33,102
The men in our country
hate the idea of apologizing.

Oh my, God.
- He's flat on the ground.

Hey.. Radhe
- Don't heat him.

She is looking this way.

538

a kick out of it, don't you?

Satisfied now?

right to ogle at girls?

Look at me, I am talking to you!

552
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,368
All this doesn't suit you.
Look at your age.

you want to tie the knot with..

...some ordinary IAS,
doctor or engineer...

568

for some romance in life.

572
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,306
...I decided that I'll stand
up against the whole world for you!

573
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:28,143
And about following you around...

574
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:29,443
Here you go...

my cycle where am I going to call?

If you can take it off,
then you can put it hack too.

592
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,096
You didn't have to come
all the way here for that.

593
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:26,127
Leave.

594
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:32,204
I may have studied BCA but,
my GK isn't better than yours.

"but my thinking's
completely modern.

with some ordinary, homely girl or...

...do you want
some romance in life?

601

nameplate on madam's cycle...

602
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:57,055
...so that my number
glitters even in the dark.

603
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:00,130
And see to it that
she has no more trouble.

604
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:10,233

611
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,706
Will you come to topper,
with the marriage proposal?

612
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:42,837
No.

613
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,476
In fact, my advice is that you
shouldn't either. Just WhatsApp her.

614
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:49,972
Aren't you my brother?
- No.

615
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:52,143
But if you still insist on going...

616
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:55,051
...then he honest with them
and tell them about the 'two thumbs'.

617
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,647
They are educated people, you fool.
Let me make an impression on them first.

618
00:37:58,746 --> 00:38:01,283
Otherwise, they will
show me the way out.

619
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:04,827
Will you come along?

620
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:08,061
Take me to Syria instead.
I am not coming with you.

621
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:12,932
How could I say no to brother,
isn't it, aunty?

622
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:14,529
So I had to come down to talk.

623
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:16,233
And uncle,
I knew this since the day...

624
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:18,834
...brother put up huge
hoardings of sister-in-law.

625
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:23,578
Can I ask you a question, son?
- Yes.

626
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:26,444
I hope you won't mind.
- Not at all.

627
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:29,015
Guys your age
normally have two kids.

628
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:31,487
So why...
- There's Mallika.

629
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:34,082
I mean he will treat
sister-in-law like a queen.

630
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:36,890
I see...
- You see...he's also past that age.

631
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,452
But he has many desires.

632
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,522
You see, aunty,
I never got the time.

633
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:43,396
In fact, I never came
across anyone like Jaya.

634
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:45,365
That's true.

635
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,828
Have some tea, son.
- No...

636
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:50,942
I'll get you some cola.
- Get some cola for him, aunty.

637
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:52,466
But make sure it's sugar-free.

638
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:53,842
You see, brother likes
to maintain himself.

639
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:54,844
I see...
- Right?

640
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,108
No-no-no...
- I'll go get it for you.

641
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:57,410
No need for that.
- Let's get to the point.

642
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:58,041
Yes.

643
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,977
Do you put the holy thread
over your ear while peeing?

644
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:04,478
No...not at all, uncle.
No formality in an emergency.

645
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:06,022
No...not at all.

646
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,183
Mahatma Gandhi has said...

647
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:09,626
"Be the change you
wish to see in the world."

648
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,729
Because the world...

649
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,028
International knowledge.

650
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:15,088
Uncle...

651
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:17,464
I just love wise men.

652
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:19,935
Sunny Leone or Mallika Sherawat?
- Huh?

653
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,603
Tell him to stop"

654
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:23,130
What?

655
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,767
Sunny Leone or Mallika Sherawat?
- He's at it again.

656
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:28,539
Sunny Leone.

657
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:31,439
Give me five.

658
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,074
Radhe Cycle.
- Yes.

659
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:34,347
Take a seat.

660
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:39,020
Well...I completely
trust my daughter Jaya.

661
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,047
Ida too.

662
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:43,219
If she's chosen you, then
there must he something about you.

663
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,127
Yes.
- All I have to say is...

664
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,360
"just keep her happy.

665
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:51,228
Uncle, I can shut shop
and take up a government job.

666
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:54,636
No-no...
- Just say it...

667
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:56,799
By the way,
son, who else is there in your family?

668
00:39:56,897 --> 00:40:00,208
There's me,
Naru and Panditji, my father.

669
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:02,847
All men.

670
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:07,779
Yes... mother passed
away when I was a kid.

671
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:11,445
And our grandma lives in Gorakhpur.
- Okay, okay.

672
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:14,152
And anyway,
aunty, once he gets married..

673
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:16,057
"They will carry
forward the lineage.

674
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:18,553
Children.

675
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:19,995
So let's take this one step ahead.

676
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:21,725
When is Keshav introducing
us to Panditji?

677
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,891
Don't ask him, sister-in-law.

678
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:26,603
Father will give him special time.

679
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:29,173
Isn't that right, brother?
Let's go see father.

680
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:39,014
He seems to he in a good mood.

681
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:40,981
I'll go first.

682
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:45,555
Guess who, father?

683
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:48,024
Now what trouble is this?

684
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:52,121
Rascals, never let
me do anything in peace.

685
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:57,260
Don't just stand there and stare,
say something.

686
00:40:57,691 --> 00:40:59,967
Father, I was saying...

687
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,232
Father...

688
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:04,138
You want to go to Mumbai
to become a hero at this age.

689
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,105
Is business running in a loss?

690
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:14,345
Then what else is it?

691
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:16,980
Speak LIP-

692
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:18,318
Father, I... he...

693
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:20,621
Brother...
- I want to get married.

694
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:23,587
Get me married.

695
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,129
Curses.

696
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:30,057
I can see that.
- What, father?

697
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,103
The volcano erupting inside you.

698
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,465
What? - You've got some
of father's pee on your cheek.

699
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:40,906
You numbskulls...I've
told you a thousand times.

700
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:44,939
Your wife must have
two thumbs on her hand.

701
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:47,483
We already have a buffalo
tied in our courtyard with two horns.

702
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,210
Let's stop ranting
about two-thumbs.

703
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:53,291
You fool...that was just to get rid
of his 'Manglik' (inauspicious) phase.

704
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:56,290
What about the faults
still left in his birth-chart?

705
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:57,621
And why do you think...

706
00:41:57,785 --> 00:42:00,356
...I am insisting on getting
him a wife with two thumbs?

707
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:02,697
According to the scriptures...

708
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:07,796
...Water, Earth, Sky, Wind,
and Fire. The thumb...represents fire.

709
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:12,108
Only double fire can absolve the
final faults in his birth-chart.

710
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,209
So...you must marry someone...

711
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,773
...who has 'double
fire' on her left hand.

712
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,074
Yeah...

713
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,718
This is really terrible, brother.

714
00:42:25,145 --> 00:42:29,116
I wonder what I did
to deserve this imbecile?

715
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:34,163
Can I say something, brother?

716
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:37,601
I think you should shift in
the barn with sister-in-law Mallika.

717
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:39,903
I've another idea.

718
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:41,738
Should I ask Hrithik?

719
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:43,340
Maybe he knows someone.

720
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,115
You know what...

721
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:52,742
...why don't you put
up posters for this too.

722
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:55,310
"Wanted!
With two thumbs."

723
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,752
I'm in a real tight spot,
and you think it's funny.

724
00:43:00,014 --> 00:43:01,925
Look...on a serious note...

725
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:03,485
Why don't you
tell father everything?

726
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:05,793
Hang me upside down father.

727
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:10,125
You're <i>36</i> years old...
and still scared of your father.

728
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:12,262
Not at all,
I'm not scared of my father.

729
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:14,363
Really.
- I am scared of myself...

730
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:17,974
If I lose my mind, I swear,
I will make father's life hell.

731
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:19,141
Of course.

732
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:23,775
Don't you have a solution
on your computer.

733
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:25,713
For this? No...

734
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,886
Only some quick-fixer
can find a solution to this.

735
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,387
You're right...why move mountains
when we can find a quick-fix for it.

736
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,960
Absolutely right, mister.

737
00:43:39,787 --> 00:43:42,063
It's a question of our image now.

738
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:45,294
Brother,
two cups of tea...with ginger.

739
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,770
Make it good.
- Yes.

740
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:50,070
Brother, no ginger in mine.
- Okay.

741
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:03,983
Listen.
- Yes.

742
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:06,923
Can you knit?
- Yes, why?

743
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:19,398
Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

744
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,268
Consider it done.

745
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:31,013
0 benevolent Lord, get me married.

746
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:37,685
"There isn't a moment of peace without it."
- Keshav.

747
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:42,349
Are you dead?
- "Always keeps you on your toes."

748
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:46,160
"Spins around like
the wheel of a cycle."

749
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,862
"Anyone in this predicament
is always happy."

750
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,138
"The path of love isn't easy."

751
00:44:57,197 --> 00:45:03,375
"There's nothing more
complicated than love."

752
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:11,248
"There's nothing more
complicated than love."

753
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:28,196
"I got cheated by my own heart..."

754
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:32,433
"...and started believing you."

755
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:35,076
"I got cheated by my own heart..."

756
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:37,241
"...and started believing you."

757
00:45:37,271 --> 00:45:39,581
"Finally my
heart took the bait..."

758
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:43,577
"...and sacrificed
all its dreams for you."

759
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:49,418
"Small issue, lots of pain."

760
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:55,628
"There's nothing more
complicated than love."

761
00:45:55,989 --> 00:46:03,100
"There's nothing more
complicated than love."

762
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,335
Just remember three things.

763
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:08,343
Don't try to scratch with it...
or the nail will come off.

764
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,381
Keep it away from fire,
or it will melt.

765
00:46:10,504 --> 00:46:13,610
And don't use it for legal purposes
it doesn't have a fingerprint.

766
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:15,783
Not at all. Never.

767
00:46:15,843 --> 00:46:17,948
Congratulations on your wedding, brother.
- Get lost.

768
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:33,696
Impossible!

769
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:36,266
Just like Hritika Roshan.

770
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:39,472
Where did you find her?

771
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:43,246
Father, last night Goddess
Laxmi came in my dreams.

772
00:46:43,404 --> 00:46:45,782
And in the morning when
I went to the riverside...

773
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:50,016
...this fell on me from the roof.

774
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:53,290
When she came looking for this,
I did the smart thing and hid myself.

775
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,757
I swear father,
there was fire emitting from her.

776
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:58,760
She was double fire, take a look.

777
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:01,059
See, this" See, father.

778
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,363
Father, get me married.

779
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:09,299
Father...

780
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:24,014
Come, Come"

781
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:27,589
Hey stop please.

782
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:28,723
Who is it?

783
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:30,056
Bless you.
- Careful.

784
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,925
Come here.

785
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:43,467
[Chanting Prayer]

786
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:49,003
Hurry up. Hurry "P-

[Chanting Prayer]

788
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,253
Bless you, two.
Bless you.

789
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:08,863
Father...double fire.
- Yes.

790
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:11,294
Everything's going
to he just delightful now.

791
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,337
Not just delightful, now brother's
going to tango every night.

00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:16,975
Am I right, Sister-in-law?

793
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:21,005
Brother Keshav, come please.

794
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:26,308
Congratulation Brother Keshav.

795
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:28,084
Well done"

796
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:31,021
You are great!

797
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:33,724
Come dance with me.

798
00:48:33,981 --> 00:48:35,392
Very good.

799
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:41,356
Brother Keshav, do the serpent dance.

800
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:46,605
Well done Father"

801
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:54,373
Hail to Brother keshav!

802
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,049
Dance with me also.

803
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:07,248
Come sister-in-law.

804
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:09,659
Come brother.

805
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,598
Aunty, your daughter-in-law's here.

806
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:16,794
Right foot,
sister-in-law...right foot.

807
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:19,897
Come, sister-in-law.

808
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,813
Welcome, sister-in-law.
This is our courtyard.

809
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,177
Welcome.

810
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:33,376
<i>Stop-stars“?-</i>

811
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:35,043
Let me introduce you to his first.

812
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,789
You're the second wife,
not the first. She's his first.

813
00:49:37,845 --> 00:49:40,121
Her name is Mallika you
must meet and greet her first.

814
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:41,592
You can meet her later.

815
00:49:41,715 --> 00:49:42,716
Come here first.
- This isn't right.

816
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:44,422
Listen to me...

817
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:46,064
You're in a lot of hurry today.

818
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:47,963
Do you always have to interfere?
Get lost.

819
00:49:48,022 --> 00:49:50,764
I am not going anywhere.
I'm going to sleep in the middle.

820
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:22,690
What is that?

821
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:27,000
'Sande Ka Tel'.
- Shameless.

822
00:50:27,594 --> 00:50:30,234
Here...my mistress
sent this for you. Drink it.

823
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:32,469
You can't even
take a joke nowadays.

824
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:34,476
Even you kept me in the dark.

825
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:37,012
I want a divorce, that's it.

826
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:38,980
I see...

827
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,314
Let's get on with
the wedding night...

828
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,514
...and I'll divorce your
entire family in the morning.

829
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:47,391
Will you come quietly...or jump?

830
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:49,525
Jump,
- Jump!

831
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,498
Sister Mallika...

832
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:58,093
Sister Mallika, help!

833
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,703
Curse those two.

834
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:14,882
Sister-in-law.

835
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,613
Sister-in-law.

836
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,186
Get up.

837
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:23,423
Get up.

838
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:26,929
You already woke me
up three times last night.

839
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:28,967
I am a man, not a machine.

840
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,962
Useless.

841
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,108
Sister-in-law, recognize me?

842
00:51:39,133 --> 00:51:41,306
I am Sana. We met at your wedding.

843
00:51:41,502 --> 00:51:42,845
Yes, Sana, but...

844
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,281
It's already 4:15.

845
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:47,376
Everyone's eagerly waiting
to welcome you to our IOTA party.

846
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:49,818
Sana, is it going to take long?

847
00:51:50,077 --> 00:51:53,388
Get the new daughter-in-law quickly.
It's getting urgent.

848
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:57,227
You go, Sana.
I'll meet everyone later.

849
00:51:57,484 --> 00:52:00,090
It will he dawn soon.

850
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:02,925
You go, I am coming.

851
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:04,727
Hurry up then.

852
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,538
We've along way to go.

853
00:52:09,396 --> 00:52:11,376
Wake up. Keshav, wake up.

854
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:14,669
Wake up! - My dear, are you going
to wake me up like this every day?

855
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:15,941
Why didn't you tell me?

856
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,878
But Naru did
tell you about Mallika?

857
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:20,043
Stop joking-

858
00:52:20,174 --> 00:52:21,812
Why were these
women calling me out?

859
00:52:21,842 --> 00:52:23,685
Don't you have
a toilet in your home?

860
00:52:24,678 --> 00:52:25,486
Toilet?

861
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:31,093
No toilet...where?

862
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:32,152
There's one in my home.

863
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:34,097
Why didn't you tell
me before our marriage?

864
00:52:35,956 --> 00:52:36,832
Tell you what?

865
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,869
That you don't have
a toilet in your home.

866
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:42,563
Why are you making a scene for it?

867
00:52:42,796 --> 00:52:43,968
Where should I go then?

868
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:46,574
Same place everyone else is going.

869
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:50,244
Socialize with everyone, get
to know everyone in the IOTA party.

870
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,442
Be their leader...

871
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:53,046
Be their leader!

872
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:56,384
Listen to me.
Such anger for a toilet?

873
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:58,989
If I had known,
I would've never married you.

874
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:00,220
Move!

875
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,703
Didn't anyone in the
village build a toilet, Sana?

876
00:53:14,995 --> 00:53:17,168
No, sister-in-law,
there isn't one here.

877
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:19,244
What's the matter?
Is there a problem?

878
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:22,372
Don't you think it's a problem...to
defecate out in the open.

879
00:53:22,636 --> 00:53:24,274
But this is important.

880
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:25,983
How can we do without it?

881
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:28,244
No walls or doors.

882
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,447
What if someone sees you?
- Now I get it.

883
00:53:31,745 --> 00:53:33,850
I guess there's been
an incident with you.

884
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:35,518
Is everyone waiting
for an incident to happen?

885
00:53:35,683 --> 00:53:37,162
Until then,
let things continue the way they are.

886
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:37,855
Isn't it?

887
00:53:38,185 --> 00:53:39,823
Are you two going to chatter alone?

888
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:40,991
We're here too.

889
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:43,091
You're really beautiful.

890
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:45,194
Also, you had a love-marriage.

891
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:48,302
Yes, of course, that's what
girls do when they get educated.

892
00:53:48,328 --> 00:53:50,808
Yes...that's what they
teach us in college.

893
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,741
She's got a sharp tongue, sister.

894
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:55,174
He was always so predictable.

895
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:58,873
We always knew, Keshav will
marry some English-speaking girl.

896
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:03,411
How much further?
- Just a little more, sister-in-law.

897
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:06,923
What if we have
to go during the day.

898
00:54:06,947 --> 00:54:08,449
Control it.

899
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:12,229
Hurry up, daughter-in-law,
it will he dawn soon.

900
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:32,646
Will you just stand there
and stare at us, daughter-in-law?

901
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,942
Aren't your in-laws feeding you?

902
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:37,511
She feels embarrassed.

903
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:41,751
Forsake all your inhibitions
and get down to business.

904
00:54:42,883 --> 00:54:44,556
I'm not used to it.

905
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:47,858
Did your parents
build a palace for you?

906
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:48,990
You are right.

907
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:52,196
Yes...there was
a toilet in my home.

908
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,066
I can't do this.

909
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:55,569
Listen...
- Daughter-in-law.

910
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,234
You'll get in trouble later.

911
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:07,946
Just watching television.

912
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:23,264
Come... Father's not at home.

913
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,396
You're still angry with me.

914
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,202
Say something.

915
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,807
Why are you making such a scene?

916
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:42,518
I can't defecate
out in the open, Keshav.

917
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:46,925
Do something...or I'm leaving.

918
00:56:03,998 --> 00:56:04,840
Father...

919
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:08,306
...we delivered Gokul's
consignment yesterday.

920
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:10,611
Some minor things to do.

921
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:13,951
I've called a handyman.
The roof was leaking.

922
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:16,452
And build a small
toilet in the room.

923
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:18,783
What did you say?
- The spare parts will arrive from Agra...

924
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:20,817
Huh?
- What did you say?

925
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:23,326
Spare parts...

926
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:25,256
Before that.

927
00:56:26,287 --> 00:56:29,166
The roof was leaking.
- After that?

928
00:56:35,963 --> 00:56:37,442
Build a small toilet...

929
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,872
What happened, father?

930
00:56:41,101 --> 00:56:43,240
I can't swallow a single morsel...

931
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,648
...if anyone mentions
a toilet while eating.

932
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:52,588
And now our... topper daughter-in-law
wants a loo in our home.

933
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:00,694
No respect for our culture or
knowledge of our tradition and rituals.

934
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:06,234
Over-education makes
you a failure in life.

935
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:19,816
Give me some bread.
- Yes, me too...

936
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,715
What is this?

937
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,416
Father's share of bread...

938
00:57:59,213 --> 00:58:00,419
Go give this to father.

939
00:58:03,384 --> 00:58:06,297
Come along, father will like that.

940
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:09,130
Come.

941
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:25,074
Father, please eat...

942
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:30,721
Stop venting your
anger on food, father.

943
00:58:31,578 --> 00:58:34,081
Daughter-in-law cooked this
food without going to the toilet.

944
00:58:34,215 --> 00:58:35,922
I won't eat this.

945
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:46,336
By the way, father, if we can
have a living room, a dining room...

946
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:49,030
...then, we can certainly
build a toilet.

947
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,174
Then why take the
body to the crematorium?

948
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:54,435
You can burn me right
here in our courtyard.

949
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,378
And then build a toilet.

950
00:59:37,478 --> 00:59:39,219
Come Jaya, it's really late.

951
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:47,129
Jaya...

952
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:49,167
Jaya, I am trying.

953
00:59:49,757 --> 00:59:52,135
I've already put in
a request with father.

954
00:59:56,497 --> 00:59:58,977
Darling...just a few more days.

955
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,143
Soon we'll find
a solution for this.

956
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:04,072
What solution?

957
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:07,180
Build a fake toilet,
like the fake thumb.

958
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:10,445
Trying to make quick-fixes.
- Jaya..

959
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,366
No-no-no...look.

960
01:00:29,563 --> 01:00:31,702
Look closely who
defecates out in the open.

961
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:33,403
There should he some difference.

962
01:00:38,005 --> 01:00:40,747
Here...it's your uncle calling.

963
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:44,745
Tell him...what you
thought was a smartphone...

964
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:46,723
...turned out to he a small pager.

965
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:59,896
Radhe-Radhe, uncle.
- Everything okay.

966
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,237
Tell me...how can there
he so much peace in Mandgaon.

967
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,671
We sent a storm from here.

968
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:09,445
Forget the storm, uncle,
I am preparing for World War 3.

969
01:01:09,637 --> 01:01:12,208
Have faith in me.
- I do...

970
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:15,879
Keep a firm grip
on those cycle-sellers.

971
01:01:17,444 --> 01:01:18,286
Hmm...

972
01:01:19,546 --> 01:01:21,548
Why are you sounding so low?
Is everything alright?

973
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:22,456
Give it to me.

974
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,554
No, uncle.

975
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:27,688
I was just feeling tired.

976
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:30,902
Right, I guess you don't
get much sleep these days.

977
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:34,766
Listen, tell Keshav that
Sunny's new film is releasing.

978
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:35,967
We'll go watch it together.

979
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:37,771
Uncle...
- Let me talk properly...

980
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,108
Dear...is everything fine?

981
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:45,216
Yes..
- When are you coming home?

982
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:49,810
Hello-hello.

983
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:51,414
Hello.
- What happened?

984
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:02,629
There's always a villain
in every love story.

985
01:02:02,923 --> 01:02:06,336
And in my case, it's the toilet.

986
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:09,231
I must fix this once and for all.

987
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:12,408
I have an idea.

988
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:14,906
Take your problem
to the Pradhan.

989
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:17,074
Get out of here...
the Pradhan.

990
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:22,720
Pradhan!

991
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:27,818
[Folk song]

992
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,294
[Folk song]

993
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:38,229
I'm asking you for the fourth time.
Why bring me here at the crack of dawn?

994
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:40,702
Wait, sweetheart. Be patient.

995
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:43,807
Everyone must change with time.

996
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:46,107
I've heard she's well educated.

997
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:47,908
Are you planning on letting
her take up a job as well?

998
01:02:47,968 --> 01:02:48,878
Oh, no...

999
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:52,077
It's up to her.
She can do what she wants.

1000
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:54,175
Jaya, go and meet grandma upstairs.

1001
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:57,449
She's bedridden and
can't move or walk. Go on.

1002
01:02:57,478 --> 01:02:59,185
Yes, why not.

1003
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,922
That's why they had to
build a toilet in grandma's room.

1004
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,221
I'll send her.

1005
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:07,562
No-no,
she will manage herself. Go on.

1006
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,066
Don't he hasty.

1007
01:03:09,256 --> 01:03:10,963
Haste makes waste.

1008
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:12,560
Rig ht, wifey, rig ht.

1009
01:03:37,618 --> 01:03:39,427
Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1010
01:04:13,654 --> 01:04:15,327
What now?
What are you fuming about now?

1011
01:04:15,422 --> 01:04:16,366
It's nothing.

1012
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,832
What do you want?

1013
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:22,865
What kind of a question is that?
Don't you know what I want?

1014
01:04:24,264 --> 01:04:27,643
I felt like a thief
just to go to the loo.

1015
01:04:28,068 --> 01:04:31,379
You've made my life miserable.
- I can say the same for you.

1016
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:33,243
You've done me a big
favor by marrying me.

1017
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:35,184
And now I must tolerate
your educated tantrums.

1018
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:36,477
What?

1019
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:39,648
You really think
I am throwing tantrums.

1020
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,284
Isn't a woman even entitled
to a toilet in her home?

1021
01:04:43,484 --> 01:04:44,895
For years women
have been adjusting...

1022
01:04:44,919 --> 01:04:46,762
...to the methods practiced
in her in-law's home.

1023
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:48,695
It's nothing new.

1024
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,897
Education has got to your head.

1025
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:56,433
Chauhey, check the
tubes before you buy them.

1026
01:04:56,463 --> 01:04:58,033
Or else we'll get the
defective stuff again.

1027
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:00,245
Brother,
did you get the hike serviced?

1028
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,007
Father has to leave for Mathura.

1029
01:05:02,536 --> 01:05:04,709
Wouldn't I rather
sabotage the brakes?

1030
01:05:05,506 --> 01:05:06,507
Here.

1031
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,615
And don't forget
to wash the lunchbox.

1032
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:16,751
Frankly speaking, brother, God
has put you in a really fine mess.

1033
01:05:17,384 --> 01:05:19,921
I'm sure he wrote
my fate in the loo.

1034
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:22,359
Yes...and flushed it too.

1035
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:27,505
You know what,
brother why don't you buy...

1036
01:05:27,528 --> 01:05:29,633
...sister-in-law
her own personal field?

1037
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,608
That way, you can have
your cake and eat it too.

1038
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:34,707
Have you lost your mind?

1039
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,908
Go mind your own business.
- Don't come asking me for advice again.

1040
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,449
Keshav.
Keshav, wake up.

1041
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:46,580
Keshav, wake up.

1042
01:05:46,647 --> 01:05:48,092
Wake up. Wake up.
- What's wrong? Is it an earthquake?

1043
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:49,788
Take me to the field quickly.
- Field.

1044
01:05:49,984 --> 01:05:51,395
No 'ifs' or 'huts'.

1045
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:53,796
This is not the time
for your tantrums. Let's go.

1046
01:05:54,855 --> 01:05:55,856
I am sorry.

1047
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:59,098
I was very rude to you yesterday.

1048
01:05:59,894 --> 01:06:02,135
I apologize.
- Doesn't matter. Let's go.

1049
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:06,336
By the way,
the fields are very romantic.

1050
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,807
We can romance...
- This is no time to he Shahrukh Khan.

1051
01:06:18,479 --> 01:06:20,220
Curses.

1052
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:23,817
Radhe-Radhe.

1053
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,028
I'm right here.

1054
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,097
Good luck.

1055
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:45,806
Father!

1056
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:27,917
Peel these.

1057
01:08:33,247 --> 01:08:34,555
Are you done with
your work in Mathura?

1058
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:36,253
First wash my hands.
- Yes.

1059
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:46,695
What's all the racket about?

1060
01:09:30,904 --> 01:09:33,248
Clear your throat for good.

1061
01:09:38,145 --> 01:09:39,089
Father.

1062
01:09:39,613 --> 01:09:45,894
She's just tensed about
what happened today in the field.

1063
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,359
You're worried about
what happened to her.

1064
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:50,629
And what about the fact
that I fell in a pile of garbage.

1065
01:09:51,258 --> 01:09:52,828
These things happen.

1066
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:56,241
Don't complicate things.
It wasn't so serious.

1067
01:09:56,397 --> 01:09:58,240
Daughter-in-law did cover her face.

1068
01:09:58,365 --> 01:09:59,901
Then.
- I see...

1069
01:10:01,135 --> 01:10:03,137
That's a fine example, father.

1070
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:06,877
Then we don't need to cover
our faces anymore in this house!

1071
01:10:09,243 --> 01:10:10,449
Jaya.

1072
01:10:14,748 --> 01:10:15,749
Father...

1073
01:10:32,099 --> 01:10:35,808
Brother...are you planning
to jump in front of the train?

1074
01:10:37,605 --> 01:10:38,310
No...

1075
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:42,651
I'm thinking of throwing
you in front of the train.

1076
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,517
Why didn't you stop
me from getting married?

1077
01:10:47,114 --> 01:10:49,651
That doesn't make sense.
Why would I stop you?

1078
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,954
First of all, I am not
getting married because of you.

1079
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:55,630
Father was the hurdle in your life.
And you're in mine.

1080
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:57,964
He's been married twice.

1081
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,766
But no lane's concerned about me.

1082
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,769
My brother,
you don't know how happy you are.

1083
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:02,967
I don't want to he happy.

1084
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:05,202
Even I was overexcited
to get married.

1085
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:06,442
And I did.

1086
01:11:06,534 --> 01:11:09,276
You can see how she's
turned my life into hell.

1087
01:11:09,403 --> 01:11:10,905
What are you saying, brother?

1088
01:11:11,071 --> 01:11:13,517
Your wife's one in a million.

1089
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:16,852
It's better not to
have one..not like her.

1090
01:11:16,977 --> 01:11:19,116
She's got my
life trapped in an urn.

1091
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:22,351
Stop discussing our
family problems outside.

1092
01:11:22,383 --> 01:11:23,987
What family problems?

1093
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,658
When there's a problem at home a
man's going to vent it out somewhere.

1094
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:31,461
Right, Rastogi.

1095
01:11:31,525 --> 01:11:33,698
What happened, brother?
Be a little more specific.

1096
01:11:33,727 --> 01:11:35,365
How about I tell you in detail?

1097
01:11:35,496 --> 01:11:37,601
Stop provoking brother, you rascal.
- Naru!

1098
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:40,311
Show some respect.

1099
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:44,346
He's <i>35</i> years older than you.

1100
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,946
Shameless...

1101
01:11:48,075 --> 01:11:51,488
It's nothing, Rastogi.
Life's a big mess.

1102
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:53,348
Will you he a little more specific?

1103
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:54,983
Who made a mess and where?

1104
01:11:55,516 --> 01:11:57,189
I am stuck.

1105
01:11:57,551 --> 01:12:01,055
Actually, your poor sister-in-law
isn't asking for too much.

1106
01:12:01,121 --> 01:12:02,327
One toilet.

1107
01:12:02,423 --> 01:12:07,634
I am ready to give her open fields,
the jungle, trees and bushes.

1108
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:08,662
But no...

1109
01:12:08,729 --> 01:12:14,145
She insists on a 4x8 toi...let.

1110
01:12:15,269 --> 01:12:17,579
Bloody hell..
Where do I get her a toilet?

1111
01:12:17,672 --> 01:12:18,582
So that's the problem.

1112
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:22,280
It's not a problem, its blasphemy.

1113
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:24,354
And then there's Panditji.

1114
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:27,786
He's like the permanent
problem in my life.

1115
01:12:27,982 --> 01:12:30,360
He's like father-in-law from hell.

1116
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:33,657
I pray no one has to
go through this ordeal.

1117
01:12:33,888 --> 01:12:36,368
They have made my life hell.

1118
01:12:37,057 --> 01:12:38,695
Look, brother Keshav,
my advice to you is...

1119
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:41,601
...take sister-in-law to Gorakhpur,
to see your grandma.

1120
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:44,435
The train halts for
<i>7</i> minutes in your village.

1121
01:12:44,598 --> 01:12:47,010
So...when do I hook your tickets?

1122
01:12:47,334 --> 01:12:50,577
I don't want to go anywhere.
- Give it to me.

1123
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:51,707
Okay.

1124
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:01,916
What did you say?

1125
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:05,160
How long will the train halt?
- <i>7</i> minutes.

1126
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,891
Will the train halt for <i>7</i> minutes?
- Yes.

1127
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:33,158
Remember our first
meeting and climb up.

1128
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,916
Go on, you have seven minutes.

1129
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:44,132
"Your love's
slowly growing on me."

1130
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,300
"Like ginger blends
with the morning tea."

1131
01:13:48,396 --> 01:13:52,071
"Your love's
slowly growing on me."

1132
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,742
"Like ginger blends
with the morning tea."

1133
01:13:57,204 --> 01:14:02,654
"I eagerly wait for you,
like for the morning rays in winter."

1134
01:14:02,943 --> 01:14:08,518
"I'm prepared to ride
all the way to the moon."

1135
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:10,859
"The morning train..."

1136
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:14,093
"Your love's
like the morning train."

1137
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:16,567
"The morning train..."

1138
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:19,695
"Your love's
like the morning train."

1139
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,204
"I stay awake all night..."

1140
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:25,403
"Your love's
like the morning train."

1141
01:14:25,432 --> 01:14:27,878
"The morning train..."

1142
01:14:27,902 --> 01:14:31,782
"Your love's
like the morning train."

1143
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,046
It's three...

1144
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:35,481
Oh, God!
- Yes.

1145
01:14:35,509 --> 01:14:37,853
I won.
- What is this? I don't want to play.

1146
01:14:38,245 --> 01:14:39,690
You know what, you go.

1147
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,589
Your sister-in-law
and I are going to play.

1148
01:14:41,715 --> 01:14:43,752
Where are you taking the game?

1149
01:14:43,784 --> 01:14:44,694
Brother's going to play
another games with you now.

1150
01:14:44,718 --> 01:14:46,391
How are we going to play now?

1151
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:48,088
Let's play.-

1152
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:05,277
"We set out before dawn."

1153
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:11,214
"Let the world he envy."

1154
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:16,285
"We set out before dawn."

1155
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:22,228
"Let the world he envy."

1156
01:15:22,423 --> 01:15:25,233
"The heart keeps chugging."

1157
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:28,035
"Keeps stopping on the way."

1158
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:30,838
"The heart keeps chugging."

1159
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:33,368
"Keeps stopping on the way."

1160
01:15:33,434 --> 01:15:38,782
"And sometimes heats fast
like an express train."

1161
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:41,319
"The morning train..."

1162
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:43,515
"Your love's
like the morning train."

1163
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:44,716
Keshav.
- Yes, father.

1164
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:50,524
Give this to the Pradhan when
you go out for one of your joyrides.

1165
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:51,391
Yes.

1166
01:15:52,519 --> 01:15:53,520
Oh no!

1167
01:15:54,855 --> 01:15:56,926
We're late today.
- No, we're not.

1168
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:59,594
I'll just go deliver this
to the Pradhan. Okay.

1169
01:16:01,028 --> 01:16:03,304
Come hack soon.
- I'll he hack in a jiffy.

1170
01:16:09,937 --> 01:16:11,439
Check the next compartment, dear.

1171
01:16:11,472 --> 01:16:13,281
You'll find an empty one.
- Thank you.

1172
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:17,019
Move. Move, mister.

1173
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:17,953
Read it.

1174
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:28,657
Hurry up.
- The train's about to leave.

1175
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:44,916
Radhe-Radhe, Pradhan.
- Radhe-Radhe, son.

1176
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:46,245
What brings you here so
early in the morning, Keshav.

1177
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:50,085
Father sent these
documents for attestation.

1178
01:16:50,111 --> 01:16:52,591
Take a seat...let's
have a cup of tea. Vimla.

1179
01:16:52,646 --> 01:16:54,922
No-no-no...not now.
I'm getting late. Maybe next time.

1180
01:16:55,149 --> 01:16:58,687
Take a seat,
it's not like you've to catch a train.

1181
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,838
What...

1182
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:11,134
Okay, see you then.
- Okay.

1183
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:11,938
Radhe-Radhe.

1184
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:13,909
Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1185
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:17,475
I only want the betterment
of this village.

1186
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:19,506
That's true.
Anything for this village...

1187
01:17:43,898 --> 01:17:45,343
Open the door!

1188
01:18:01,582 --> 01:18:03,823
Quickly. The train's leaving,
Open the door!

1189
01:18:05,586 --> 01:18:07,532
Open the door.
- Yes, we're moving it.

1190
01:18:07,555 --> 01:18:08,727
Open the door.

1191
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:10,531
The train's leaving,
Open the door!

1192
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:12,537
Yes, we're moving it.

1193
01:18:12,593 --> 01:18:14,436
Get everything aside.

1194
01:18:14,495 --> 01:18:16,532
Move.
- Yes, we're moving it.

1195
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,249
Keep it here...

1196
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:32,450
Come... come"

1197
01:18:54,268 --> 01:18:56,077
Jaya, get down.

1198
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:59,684
Jaya, pull the chain.

1199
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:02,612
Pull the chain!

1200
01:19:03,477 --> 01:19:04,888
Pull the chain!

1201
01:19:06,547 --> 01:19:07,787
Jaya!

1202
01:19:08,549 --> 01:19:09,789
Jaya!

1203
01:19:10,517 --> 01:19:12,554
Jaya! What are you doing?
Pull the chain.

1204
01:19:14,722 --> 01:19:17,032
We're running out of platform.

1205
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:21,234
Pull the chain!

1206
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:29,477
Jaya.

1207
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:36,483
Jaya. Pull the chain!

1208
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:11,417
Shooting" Shooting"

1209
01:20:15,449 --> 01:20:17,759
Even if you call 100 times
you'll get the same answer, Keshav.

1210
01:20:17,885 --> 01:20:19,057
I am not coming hack.

1211
01:20:19,086 --> 01:20:21,589
Think about the rumor
people are going to spread.

1212
01:20:21,722 --> 01:20:24,066
Keshav's wife
left him for a toilet.

1213
01:20:24,191 --> 01:20:27,297
Will you feel proud if your
wife defecates out in the open?

1214
01:20:27,461 --> 01:20:29,463
You're getting it all wrong.

1215
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:31,705
We'll find a way.

1216
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:33,309
You mean another quick-fix.

1217
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:35,740
When in love,
the best solution is to run away.

1218
01:20:35,769 --> 01:20:38,750
Fake thumb for marriage and,
using the loo on the train.

1219
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:40,349
Listen carefully, Keshav.

1220
01:20:40,508 --> 01:20:42,351
No more quick-fixes.

1221
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:43,817
Find a permanent solution.

1222
01:20:43,911 --> 01:20:47,324
You know what, you can take
your demands and sit in your toilet.

1223
01:20:47,448 --> 01:20:48,552
Okay. Okay.

1224
01:20:52,486 --> 01:20:57,060
See...
she's publicly embarrassed us.

1225
01:20:57,257 --> 01:20:58,497
What happened, father?

1226
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,739
Read, son. Read.

1227
01:21:01,896 --> 01:21:04,172
She's made us Pandit's so proud.

1228
01:21:05,165 --> 01:21:07,202
Your grandma called.
- Yes.

1229
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,039
She's coming down
from Gorakhpur next week.

1230
01:21:09,136 --> 01:21:09,841
Yes, father.

1231
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:15,246
She just made a big joke out of us.

1232
01:21:15,276 --> 01:21:16,277
Brother. . look. .

1233
01:21:17,778 --> 01:21:19,052
Tell him, Naru.

1234
01:21:19,446 --> 01:21:21,551
Now he must take
care of the household.

1235
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:23,790
Couldn't even
take care of his wife.

1236
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:28,162
She's not some piece of cloth
which needs to he taken care of.

1237
01:21:28,856 --> 01:21:29,891
Come on.

1238
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,501
He's only good
for cleaning up dung.

1239
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:35,605
Only animals are allowed
to shit in this courtyard.

1240
01:21:35,796 --> 01:21:37,275
Which scoundrel
published this news?

1241
01:21:37,298 --> 01:21:39,278
We've been betrayed
by one of our own.

1242
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,608
Rastogi from Jagran.

1243
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:45,281
Brother Keshav.
- Bloody traitor...

1244
01:21:45,306 --> 01:21:47,479
How dare you!

1245
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:51,254
How dare you humiliate my family!

1246
01:21:51,278 --> 01:21:52,848
Now he's got the respect he deserved.
- Brother, please...

1247
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,223
Come on.

1248
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:58,128
Whatever I did,
was for your own good.

1249
01:21:58,452 --> 01:22:01,228
Shut it down. Shut it down.
Go hack inside.

1250
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,598
You bloody...

1251
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,326
Speak up!

1252
01:22:04,358 --> 01:22:06,338
Tell me.
- Listen to me, brother, please...

1253
01:22:06,427 --> 01:22:08,634
I'll tell you
if you stop hitting me.

1254
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:10,335
Speak up. Yes, tell me.

1255
01:22:10,431 --> 01:22:11,808
Listen to me...

1256
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:14,337
This news would've
been out soon enough.

1257
01:22:14,468 --> 01:22:17,347
My newspaper didn't
expose some hidden scam.

1258
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:23,286
Thanks to your newspaper.
Those who didn't know also know.

1259
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:24,355
Just wait and watch...

1260
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:27,449
...sister-in-law will come
hack home due to this article.

1261
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:28,357
HOW?

1262
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:31,759
The bride's family never likes
to see such news in the newspaper.

1263
01:22:31,919 --> 01:22:33,227
There must he chaos in their house.

1264
01:22:33,254 --> 01:22:34,255
All of them must
he completely shaken.

1265
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:42,835
'You said...'

1266
01:22:43,063 --> 01:22:46,067
Can someone please lower the volume so
we can discuss more important issues?

1267
01:22:46,267 --> 01:22:50,272
These so called 'important'
issues are what's ruining the country.

1268
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:53,381
"How long are we
going to mourn and cry."

1269
01:22:53,407 --> 01:22:56,251
"Pull up the blanket
over your head and sleep."

1270
01:22:56,744 --> 01:22:58,018
Please stay quiet.

1271
01:22:58,713 --> 01:23:00,056
I can't hear the dialogues, mother.

1272
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:03,786
Did anyone read today's newspapers?

1273
01:23:03,951 --> 01:23:05,760
What is everyone's
opinion about it?

1274
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,299
This is Kakka's contribution in
'Swacchta Ahhiyan' (Clean India Movement).

1275
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:12,599
Today's newspaper was fit
to he used as waste and so I did.

1276
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:17,334
Waste should always go
into the wastepaper basket.

1277
01:23:17,431 --> 01:23:19,172
'They will die for you?
- Yes.'

1278
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:23,205
'But I am not like them.
lam different.'

1279
01:23:27,742 --> 01:23:28,812
My thumb.

1280
01:23:40,254 --> 01:23:41,927
Daughter-in-law's thumb?

1281
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:50,865
What if Rastogi's right, brother?

1282
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:53,371
Maybe sister-in-law will
come hack after reading this news.

1283
01:23:53,401 --> 01:23:55,005
She won't.

1284
01:23:55,169 --> 01:23:58,013
I wonder how many times I will
still get humiliated... - Useless!

1285
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:01,550
Both of you are useless!

1286
01:24:01,842 --> 01:24:02,946
Useless!

1287
01:24:03,978 --> 01:24:05,753
This...

1288
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,188
This fake thumb that you made...

1289
01:24:09,516 --> 01:24:11,621
It's not for me or religion.

1290
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:16,564
She left it behind for you,
your topper madam.

1291
01:24:16,891 --> 01:24:23,001
And now...even the Lord
can't absolve your troubles.

1292
01:24:23,264 --> 01:24:24,800
But, father, sister-in-law only...
- Shut up.

1293
01:24:24,965 --> 01:24:27,969
Don't you dare mention
her name here again?

1294
01:24:28,002 --> 01:24:28,878
Yes, father.

1295
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:32,983
They want show religion the finger.

1296
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:34,679
Stop pretending!

1297
01:24:35,876 --> 01:24:37,355
Get up brother.

1298
01:24:55,629 --> 01:24:57,609
Field clear.. silence.

1299
01:24:57,665 --> 01:24:58,302
Taking.

1300
01:24:58,365 --> 01:25:00,208
Ready, sir.
- Action.

1301
01:25:00,234 --> 01:25:02,111
Do I look stupid to you?

1302
01:25:02,202 --> 01:25:04,204
I'm sorry.
- What sorry.

1303
01:25:11,746 --> 01:25:13,350
You think I can't see.

1304
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,553
You were flirting with her,
I saw it with my own eyes.

1305
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:19,120
You don't trust me.
You trust me right?

1306
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:26,334
I love you.

1307
01:25:26,393 --> 01:25:27,133
Cut it.

1308
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:32,802
I see... so these oversized
boxes are toilets.

1309
01:25:33,968 --> 01:25:36,278
Your sister-in-law will
he really comfortable in this.

1310
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:38,976
Huh?

1311
01:25:39,573 --> 01:25:42,349
Brother, I don't think
your intentions are good.

1312
01:25:43,577 --> 01:25:45,853
Careful. Careful.

1313
01:25:46,413 --> 01:25:47,721
Pull.. Pull..

1314
01:25:48,983 --> 01:25:51,554
How do you feel carrying
a loo on your shoulders, Rastogi?

1315
01:25:51,585 --> 01:25:53,963
I feel like Mother India.
- I see...

1316
01:25:54,055 --> 01:25:56,433
Brother Keshav, it looks new.

1317
01:25:56,757 --> 01:25:58,930
Don't publish
this in your newspaper.

1318
01:25:59,093 --> 01:26:03,405
Brother, after that heating,
I'll only print what you tell me to.

1319
01:26:03,431 --> 01:26:05,809
Brother, what if they file
a complaint with the police?

1320
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,540
Only if they find it.

1321
01:26:07,801 --> 01:26:09,872
Where will we hide it?

1322
01:26:10,137 --> 01:26:12,743
We'll hide it in our
courtyard for a day or two.

1323
01:26:12,773 --> 01:26:13,376
And cover it.

1324
01:26:13,441 --> 01:26:16,012
Later, when father leaves
for Agra we'll shift it in my room.

1325
01:26:16,076 --> 01:26:16,747
Come on.

1326
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:47,810
Can't live without me?

1327
01:26:48,242 --> 01:26:49,585
There's something
I want to tell you.

1328
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:51,850
That's what phones are for.

1329
01:26:52,346 --> 01:26:53,552
Not like this.

1330
01:26:53,747 --> 01:26:54,885
Let's meet.

1331
01:26:55,349 --> 01:26:56,419
What is it this time?

1332
01:26:56,483 --> 01:26:57,894
Some quick-fix again.

1333
01:26:58,018 --> 01:27:00,430
No quick-fix...this time
I've come up with an idea.

1334
01:27:01,222 --> 01:27:02,223
Can we meet?

1335
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,160
Then come home.

1336
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:05,426
I won't come home.

1337
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:07,228
Things will just get complicated.

1338
01:27:07,862 --> 01:27:09,500
Why? Are you feeling embarrassed?

1339
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:11,808
Fine, let's meet tonight.

1340
01:27:12,099 --> 01:27:12,804
Why?

1341
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,804
Are you embarrassed
to meet me during the day?

1342
01:27:14,935 --> 01:27:15,936
Of course, I am.

1343
01:27:16,003 --> 01:27:18,176
I don't want people
to think that I gave in.

1344
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:22,648
So where are we going
to meet my beloved wife?

1345
01:27:24,145 --> 01:27:25,954
Near the field with the tower.

1346
01:27:26,313 --> 01:27:28,315
Thank you.
- Bye.

1347
01:27:34,054 --> 01:27:38,366
Are you enjoying, meeting secretly
like this even though we're married.

1348
01:27:38,459 --> 01:27:41,269
Yeah... I've been having
fun for <i>36</i> years, madam.

1349
01:27:41,662 --> 01:27:44,575
I used all the tricks up my sleeve
to get a wife but she left me too.

1350
01:27:45,633 --> 01:27:47,909
We should've eloped instead.

1351
01:27:48,402 --> 01:27:50,575
This distance
is taking effect on you.

1352
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,377
So tell me...why
did you call me here?

1353
01:27:56,143 --> 01:27:58,487
Better prepare yourself
to come hack home.

1354
01:27:58,579 --> 01:28:00,581
I just solved this
problem permanently.

1355
01:28:00,881 --> 01:28:03,020
I see... How?

1356
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,524
See for yourself.

1357
01:28:04,985 --> 01:28:08,933
Soon I'll take you hack home,
like wedding procession.

1358
01:28:09,223 --> 01:28:11,829
You could've said
this over the phone.

1359
01:28:17,164 --> 01:28:19,110
I wanted to see you.

1360
01:28:20,634 --> 01:28:22,443
But not me.

1361
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:28,313
Why are you on-line
last night at 12:30?

1362
01:28:28,843 --> 01:28:31,153
Were you watching
my profile picture?

1363
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:35,620
You must have run your
fingers on my photo, like this.

1364
01:28:39,019 --> 01:28:41,693
I see... how do you know?

1365
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:44,225
Were you keeping an eye on me?

1366
01:28:45,292 --> 01:28:48,830
I have a drone hovering
over your father's home.

1367
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:50,836
And it keeps telling me.

1368
01:28:51,866 --> 01:28:57,179
You know, since the day I left, I've
been sleeping embracing your picture.

1369
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:59,417
So...stop doing it until
day-after-tomorrow.

1370
01:28:59,473 --> 01:29:03,250
Why?
- Everyone will think that you gave in.

1371
01:29:11,252 --> 01:29:12,856
Your phone's vibrating.

1372
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:17,094
Hold on.

1373
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,637
Speak up, bloody jinx.

1374
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:34,048
Now you guys are
stealing toilets as well.

1375
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:38,012
Because of people like you even mugs
have to he chained in train's toilets.

1376
01:29:38,145 --> 01:29:42,389
Fine, but I don't want to stand
out in the open like you guys and pee.

1377
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:44,493
Are you listening to his taunts?

1378
01:29:45,152 --> 01:29:47,223
You take the necessary action,
Inspector.

1379
01:29:47,455 --> 01:29:49,492
He has tainted my religion.

1380
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:51,168
By bringing this sin home?

1381
01:29:51,258 --> 01:29:53,499
They have been committing
the sin till now, Inspector.

1382
01:29:53,527 --> 01:29:55,234
What did his
daughter-in-law do wrong?

1383
01:29:55,262 --> 01:29:57,242
Only animals
defecate out in the open.

1384
01:29:58,099 --> 01:29:59,305
I see...

1385
01:30:02,369 --> 01:30:06,840
I raised him into this
37-year-old man that he is now.

1386
01:30:06,907 --> 01:30:09,751
And now you think it's wrong
to defecate out in the open.

1387
01:30:10,211 --> 01:30:13,215
You're right.
You raised me to he a man.

1388
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:16,527
That's why I never
thought about women.

1389
01:30:20,454 --> 01:30:21,797
Let him stay in jail.

1390
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:34,304
Grandma. Grandma, come in. Please.

1391
01:30:34,335 --> 01:30:37,339
Come in. Please.
- I will never cross this threshold!

1392
01:30:37,371 --> 01:30:38,907
I just came here to say".

1393
01:30:39,006 --> 01:30:41,850
...that you've raised your
daughter with some great values.

1394
01:30:42,009 --> 01:30:45,456
Keshav stole a loo for her.

1395
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:48,760
And now he's locked up in jail,
for stealing.

1396
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:50,322
And this princess...

1397
01:30:50,351 --> 01:30:53,161
She's sitting in her home,
over a loo.

1398
01:30:54,221 --> 01:30:55,427
Unbelievable, grandma.

1399
01:30:55,756 --> 01:30:57,326
You're saying this
even though you're a woman.

1400
01:30:57,358 --> 01:31:00,703
I'm saying this because I am a woman.
We've to compromise all the time.

1401
01:31:00,728 --> 01:31:02,298
That's the plight of women.

1402
01:31:02,329 --> 01:31:04,866
But she left her home.
That's not the way.

1403
01:31:04,965 --> 01:31:07,673
This never happened
in our village before.

1404
01:31:08,469 --> 01:31:09,709
Out on your joyride again.

1405
01:31:11,539 --> 01:31:14,748
The men can do it
right in their backyard.

1406
01:31:14,975 --> 01:31:16,318
But we're women.

1407
01:31:16,444 --> 01:31:18,856
We've to work
harder for everything.

1408
01:31:19,046 --> 01:31:19,990
Isn't it?

1409
01:31:20,114 --> 01:31:22,253
We're expected to
make all the compromises.

1410
01:31:22,516 --> 01:31:24,462
Because that's what
our culture teaches us.

1411
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:26,029
Control your urges.

1412
01:31:26,087 --> 01:31:27,862
Wait for nightfall.

1413
01:31:28,122 --> 01:31:30,193
Men can do it during the day,
but you got to do it in the dark.

1414
01:31:30,257 --> 01:31:31,361
But stay quiet!

1415
01:31:32,826 --> 01:31:36,137
If men look at you with lusty
eyes then just cover your faces..

1416
01:31:36,163 --> 01:31:37,369
"But stay quiet!

1417
01:31:37,998 --> 01:31:39,841
And when some pervert
flashes his torch at you...

1418
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,846
...then cover your faces,
rather than covering your backside!

1419
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:43,980
So that he can go
to his friends and say...

1420
01:31:44,004 --> 01:31:46,484
"I caught a glimpse,
but don't know who it was."

1421
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:50,117
Every day they kept flashing
their headlights at you...

1422
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,714
...hut it never struck you.

1423
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:56,761
You're happy because IOTA
party has a new agenda to discuss!

1424
01:31:58,953 --> 01:32:00,330
This is okay Neelam.

1425
01:32:00,921 --> 01:32:03,094
If you're having periods,
stay out of the temple.

1426
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:04,897
If there's a pyre burning
we stay out of the crematorium.

1427
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:07,164
And if we want to relieve
ourselves go outside the village.

1428
01:32:07,561 --> 01:32:08,505
Why?

1429
01:32:09,129 --> 01:32:12,338
Why make these rules?
Why only for us?

1430
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:18,276
It was their fault...hut now,
it's our fault!

1431
01:32:18,305 --> 01:32:19,511
What do you want, Jaya?

1432
01:32:19,573 --> 01:32:20,984
Do you expect us to
leave our home like you?

1433
01:32:21,142 --> 01:32:23,144
We don't have a toilet
even in our parents' home.

1434
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:24,378
I don't know.

1435
01:32:24,678 --> 01:32:26,589
I only found a
solution to my problem.

1436
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,490
But the rest of you don't
even realize that you're in trouble!

1437
01:32:30,918 --> 01:32:33,421
Someday... Someday you will
he reduced to ashes in these urns.

1438
01:32:33,721 --> 01:32:35,792
Even now you're trapped
in it while you're alive!

1439
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:44,372
Serve water to your
husband in this urn...

1440
01:32:45,466 --> 01:32:49,004
...and we'll see...whether
they make a scene, or not.

1441
01:33:17,865 --> 01:33:19,469
Come, sir.
- Please.

1442
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:23,472
Brother.
- Hello, sir.

1443
01:33:23,537 --> 01:33:24,515
Yeah...

1444
01:33:26,707 --> 01:33:27,879
Jaya.

1445
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:33,717
Sir...
- Yes, thank you.

1446
01:33:38,352 --> 01:33:40,832
This was your
solution to my problem?

1447
01:33:43,391 --> 01:33:45,496
Do me a favor, Keshav.

1448
01:33:46,694 --> 01:33:49,300
No more quick-fixes for me.

1449
01:33:52,533 --> 01:33:53,841
Forgive me.

1450
01:33:53,934 --> 01:33:55,413
Don't say that, Jaya.

1451
01:34:02,743 --> 01:34:06,657
Strange, you're hailing
out the guy who stole your loo.

1452
01:34:07,448 --> 01:34:10,827
No thief in the world
will steal a toilet, Inspector.

1453
01:34:11,085 --> 01:34:11,961
I see...

1454
01:34:12,887 --> 01:34:13,865
Okay.

1455
01:34:14,288 --> 01:34:16,165
Let Keshav go.
- Thank you, sir.

1456
01:34:28,235 --> 01:34:30,681
Come, brother.
I guess it's going to rain.

1457
01:34:31,138 --> 01:34:32,583
Let it rain, Naru.

1458
01:34:33,307 --> 01:34:36,311
Even the Lord's taunting me now.

1459
01:34:36,944 --> 01:34:40,824
Guess you're drunk...
you're not in your senses.

1460
01:34:41,382 --> 01:34:45,387
I am drunk...and even
more determined now.

1461
01:34:56,797 --> 01:34:57,935
Mom.
- Yes.

1462
01:34:58,032 --> 01:34:59,978
Where's my silver-waistband?

1463
01:35:00,668 --> 01:35:01,942
Wow...

1464
01:35:02,036 --> 01:35:05,313
If Keshav sees you today
he will take you hack home.

1465
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:07,013
Let him come.

1466
01:35:07,108 --> 01:35:08,746
I will break
his head with the stick.

1467
01:35:08,809 --> 01:35:09,981
Listen...

1468
01:35:10,344 --> 01:35:12,324
He isn't asking for dowry.

1469
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,591
Or raised his hand on you?

1470
01:35:15,282 --> 01:35:18,092
He loves you, think about it.

1471
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:20,299
End this right
here and go hack home.

1472
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:22,025
You've made things more
complicated than it is.

1473
01:35:22,089 --> 01:35:23,090
Complicated?

1474
01:35:23,791 --> 01:35:26,203
Bravo, Vidya. Bravo.

1475
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:29,307
Do you know what happened
with the kids in Badhai?

1476
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:31,509
Poor kids went out in the evening.

1477
01:35:31,599 --> 01:35:33,806
They were raped and
hung from the tree.

1478
01:35:33,934 --> 01:35:37,040
And a 17-year-old girl
in Jharkhand, committed suicide.

1479
01:35:37,071 --> 01:35:40,075
Why? Because her father
didn't build a toilet.

1480
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:45,084
God forbid if something
like that happens with our child...

1481
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:47,785
...will you still say that
she's complicating things.

1482
01:35:47,982 --> 01:35:50,326
You women are
your own worse enemies.

1483
01:35:50,451 --> 01:35:51,759
Like they say, Vidya...

1484
01:35:51,852 --> 01:35:53,889
Don't wait till it's too late.

1485
01:35:54,355 --> 01:35:56,733
It's a good thing that
our child took this step.

1486
01:35:56,924 --> 01:35:58,335
When Keshav shows up today...

1487
01:35:58,392 --> 01:36:00,429
...hit him hard
on my behalf as well.

1488
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:03,432
Forget it, grandpa.
I am not even going to look at him.

1489
01:36:20,281 --> 01:36:24,491
"I crave for your glimpse..."

1490
01:36:24,518 --> 01:36:28,489
"...and finally I realized."

1491
01:36:28,522 --> 01:36:36,522
"I want to rub the mud under your
feet on my head and sanctify my sins."

1492
01:36:45,005 --> 01:36:49,010
"You didn't invite me...hut
I still came down your lane."

1493
01:36:49,076 --> 01:36:55,618
"You can punish me
for all unfair treatment."

1494
01:37:01,689 --> 01:37:05,535
"You didn't invite me...hut
I still came down your lane."

1495
01:37:05,793 --> 01:37:09,434
"You can punish me
for all unfair treatment."

1496
01:37:09,497 --> 01:37:12,637
"Don't spare
your beloved today..."

1497
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:14,744
“...because he never learns.“

1498
01:37:14,768 --> 01:37:18,215
"Your beatings feel so sweet."

1499
01:37:18,706 --> 01:37:22,449
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1500
01:37:22,843 --> 01:37:25,050
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1501
01:37:25,112 --> 01:37:28,685
"You're the only one I love."

1502
01:37:29,049 --> 01:37:33,156
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1503
01:37:52,239 --> 01:38:00,239
"As my veil fluttered..."

1504
01:38:01,515 --> 01:38:04,724
"...you colored it with your love."

1505
01:38:04,752 --> 01:38:09,258
"...you colored it with your love."

1506
01:38:09,423 --> 01:38:17,423
"When I look into your eyes..."

1507
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:21,345
"...my eyes were overwhelmed."

1508
01:38:21,435 --> 01:38:25,611
"...they were overwhelmed."

1509
01:38:25,673 --> 01:38:30,019
"My tear-filled eyes
couldn't sleep all night."

1510
01:38:30,044 --> 01:38:32,046
"They are crazy about to you."

1511
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:34,059
"They are crazy about to you."

1512
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:38,052
"When I heard your sweet talks..."

1513
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:40,460
"...my heart was hooked on."

1514
01:38:40,487 --> 01:38:42,831
"My heart was hooked on.."

1515
01:38:42,856 --> 01:38:46,736
"I came to you leaving
the world behind."

1516
01:38:47,127 --> 01:38:51,200
"I severed all ties
just to he with you."

1517
01:38:54,902 --> 01:38:56,973
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1518
01:38:57,037 --> 01:38:59,381
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1519
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:03,320
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1520
01:39:03,377 --> 01:39:07,291
"I've forsaken everything for you,
now punish me in any way you want."

1521
01:39:07,381 --> 01:39:10,885
"We're incomplete
without each other."

1522
01:39:10,918 --> 01:39:15,298
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1523
01:39:15,322 --> 01:39:19,293
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1524
01:39:19,393 --> 01:39:24,308
"Pray to your God for me."

1525
01:39:26,901 --> 01:39:30,007
"I've let go of this shield."

1526
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:31,841
"Color me red..."

1527
01:39:31,905 --> 01:39:35,546
"...only you can set
things right for me."

1528
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:39,319
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1529
01:39:39,613 --> 01:39:41,718
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1530
01:39:41,782 --> 01:39:45,195
"You're the only one I love."

1531
01:39:45,686 --> 01:39:49,896
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1532
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:21,056
This is really humiliating, brother.

1533
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:23,994
Stop acting like some Romeo.

1534
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:26,599
Let's go inside..
It's your in-laws home.

1535
01:40:26,627 --> 01:40:28,072
Throw your weight around.

1536
01:40:28,695 --> 01:40:30,265
How can I show my face?

1537
01:40:31,866 --> 01:40:33,345
I made a big mistake.

1538
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:45,689
Well...you try talking
to sister-in-law.

1539
01:40:45,713 --> 01:40:47,317
I'll wait for you in that corner.

1540
01:40:49,316 --> 01:40:51,387
And whoever hurled
that balloon at me...

1541
01:40:51,452 --> 01:40:52,988
...I'll show him when
he comes to my village.

1542
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:55,125
I am keeping my mouth shut because
this is my sister-in-law's home.

1543
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:56,634
Otherwise I would've showed you
how we play Holi.

1544
01:41:45,306 --> 01:41:46,717
That won't do any good.

1545
01:41:47,007 --> 01:41:48,315
Apply some dirt.

1546
01:41:49,009 --> 01:41:50,215
Apply some dirt!

1547
01:41:50,677 --> 01:41:51,849
Apply some <i>s***</i> instead.

1548
01:41:52,379 --> 01:41:54,222
You're never going
to move ahead of that.

1549
01:41:54,915 --> 01:41:56,724
You claim to have
the best GK...

1550
01:41:56,784 --> 01:41:59,458
...hut never use it in real life.

1551
01:42:00,021 --> 01:42:01,591
Will dirt cure your wounds?

1552
01:42:02,723 --> 01:42:04,930
But it will definitely
cause infection.

1553
01:42:09,263 --> 01:42:12,176
You've all made a fine mess
in the name of tradition and customs.

1554
01:42:13,067 --> 01:42:15,877
When in trouble, find an easy way out.

1555
01:42:16,737 --> 01:42:19,411
Change others, but not yourself.

1556
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:26,352
Since the time I was horn,
I've always used a toilet, Keshav.

1557
01:42:27,848 --> 01:42:29,521
Why should I change my habit now?

1558
01:42:36,691 --> 01:42:40,867
Listen...it's really painful,
isn't it?

1559
01:42:41,762 --> 01:42:43,435
You're the one who got beaten up.

1560
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:52,742
But I gave you the wounds.

1561
01:42:55,376 --> 01:42:56,855
Come hack home.

1562
01:42:58,045 --> 01:43:00,047
I swear I'll change everything.

1563
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:02,387
What will you change?

1564
01:43:04,285 --> 01:43:05,662
Everyone's opinion?

1565
01:43:12,326 --> 01:43:13,828
I won't die without you.

1566
01:43:15,429 --> 01:43:16,737
lam happy-

1567
01:43:54,435 --> 01:43:55,880
You didn't go?

1568
01:43:56,703 --> 01:44:02,119
You see, brother never leave a
patient in hospital or a lover alone.

1569
01:44:02,343 --> 01:44:04,516
What did sister-in-law say?
Is she coming hack?

1570
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:10,926
No, Naru. And she shouldn't either.

1571
01:44:12,286 --> 01:44:14,630
I finally realized now.

1572
01:44:15,556 --> 01:44:18,560
How can she do something
she never did all her life?

1573
01:44:31,271 --> 01:44:33,046
This isn't just about a loo...

1574
01:44:33,807 --> 01:44:35,252
It's about everyone's view.

1575
01:44:36,043 --> 01:44:40,458
Jhoni...tell me everything.
What happened?

1576
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:44,085
What can I say, grandma...this
is getting uncomfortable?

1577
01:44:44,518 --> 01:44:48,660
They're always in the jungle before
us, with their lights and camera.

1578
01:44:48,755 --> 01:44:51,361
At first,
we thought its the shooting crew.

1579
01:44:51,659 --> 01:44:54,071
But soon we realized
they were after us.

1580
01:44:54,262 --> 01:44:56,242
Guess they are from some news channel.

1581
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:00,077
They record us like we're
indulging in foreplay.

1582
01:45:00,367 --> 01:45:02,973
It's entirely Keshav
and his wife's fault.

1583
01:45:03,137 --> 01:45:07,677
Laxmi...what did she do now?

1584
01:45:08,008 --> 01:45:11,649
Your news was published in the
newspaper and we're paying the price.

1585
01:45:11,979 --> 01:45:15,927
Jhoni, you claim to
he the leader of IOTA party...

1586
01:45:16,116 --> 01:45:18,221
...then why so embarrassed
to come on TV?

1587
01:45:18,318 --> 01:45:20,229
What are you saying, Keshav?

1588
01:45:20,321 --> 01:45:23,234
Are you drunk?
- Yes, grandma, I am drunk.

1589
01:45:23,357 --> 01:45:25,132
This is entirely your fault, Keshav.

1590
01:45:25,159 --> 01:45:26,934
Repercussions of getting
an educated wife.

1591
01:45:26,994 --> 01:45:29,201
You should he thanking us.

1592
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:31,642
You've become a model at this age,
thanks to us.

1593
01:45:31,866 --> 01:45:33,436
Every day you defecate
out in the open.

1594
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,978
So how about showing
some skin for TV as well.

1595
01:45:48,349 --> 01:45:52,593
It's alright, Panditji.
He doesn't know how to respect women.

1596
01:45:52,653 --> 01:45:56,032
The women in this country
can't respect themselves.

1597
01:45:56,423 --> 01:46:00,394
Otherwise, they would've never
agreed on defecating out in the open.

1598
01:46:07,635 --> 01:46:10,172
He's talking too much.

1599
01:46:37,064 --> 01:46:38,441
You don't worry.

1600
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:41,072
To hell with these people.

1601
01:46:41,602 --> 01:46:43,206
We'll come up with a solution.

1602
01:46:43,571 --> 01:46:45,244
We'll...
- No, Naru.

1603
01:46:46,941 --> 01:46:49,046
We're done with finding
quick solutions.

1604
01:46:50,811 --> 01:46:52,688
It's time to do the impossible.

1605
01:46:57,751 --> 01:47:00,595
Today's first agenda.

1606
01:47:00,821 --> 01:47:04,166
The shooting is taking place on
the border of both the villages.

1607
01:47:04,325 --> 01:47:06,703
The shooting crew has been warned...

1608
01:47:06,994 --> 01:47:08,996
...that they should
stop wasting water.

1609
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:11,540
The matter is under control now.

1610
01:47:12,967 --> 01:47:16,608
The next agenda,
Keshav's wife has left him.

1611
01:47:17,438 --> 01:47:19,975
And Keshav has put in a request...

1612
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:23,021
...to build a public
toilet outside the village.

1613
01:47:23,144 --> 01:47:28,753
Those who agree can sign or put
their thumb impression on this paper.

1614
01:47:32,019 --> 01:47:33,362
I don't know.

1615
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:35,662
We won't give our thumb impression.

1616
01:47:37,224 --> 01:47:40,797
Young man, did you get
this idea from the shooting crew?

1617
01:47:40,861 --> 01:47:45,935
People won't forget their values
even if you build loos for them.

1618
01:47:46,033 --> 01:47:47,944
And stop defecating in the fields?

1619
01:47:48,002 --> 01:47:50,448
Keep this stupidity
restrained to your home.

1620
01:47:50,571 --> 01:47:52,573
Stop joking, village-head.

1621
01:47:52,673 --> 01:47:54,448
I've already been arrested once.

1622
01:47:54,541 --> 01:47:56,418
If you try to burden
us with your problems...

1623
01:47:56,477 --> 01:47:58,423
...then, we'll have to face the music.

1624
01:47:58,546 --> 01:48:00,287
We got freedom from
the British rule...

1625
01:48:00,347 --> 01:48:02,588
...do you want us to
he slave to their culture?

1626
01:48:02,617 --> 01:48:04,028
That isn't right, village-head.

1627
01:48:04,318 --> 01:48:05,695
There are other women in the village.

1628
01:48:05,719 --> 01:48:08,097
And their safety is the
village council's responsibility.

1629
01:48:08,355 --> 01:48:10,699
We're happy with our IOTA party.
- Yes.

1630
01:48:10,725 --> 01:48:13,831
And what about openly
humiliating yourself.

1631
01:48:14,061 --> 01:48:16,905
Keshav, don't talk about respect.

1632
01:48:16,964 --> 01:48:18,944
Your wife left you.

1633
01:48:19,433 --> 01:48:21,174
Show some respect to others.

1634
01:48:21,202 --> 01:48:24,115
That's what he wants.
That we <i>s***</i> in our homes.

1635
01:48:24,205 --> 01:48:25,775
Or maybe <i>s***</i> in our kitchens.

1636
01:48:25,839 --> 01:48:27,819
I only want the village council...

1637
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:31,220
...to put in a request with
the government for a toilet.

1638
01:48:31,479 --> 01:48:33,356
Don't try to teach
us our responsibility.

1639
01:48:33,514 --> 01:48:34,959
This is an ancestral village.

1640
01:48:35,316 --> 01:48:37,990
Our ancestors didn't
build a toilet in our homes...

1641
01:48:38,052 --> 01:48:39,656
...and we're not Gods either.

1642
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:42,633
If we build a bathroom in our homes,
won't that dirty our homes.

1643
01:48:42,656 --> 01:48:44,567
And what about the stink.

1644
01:48:44,591 --> 01:48:46,070
You want us to invite
diseases in our homes.

1645
01:48:46,226 --> 01:48:48,900
Don't try to teach
the villagers, Keshav.

1646
01:48:48,963 --> 01:48:50,965
We don't want a bathroom.
- Of course.

1647
01:48:51,031 --> 01:48:53,511
We don't need one,
so let's not bother the government.

1648
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:54,543
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

1649
01:48:54,568 --> 01:48:56,639
That's enough social-service for one day.
- Let's go. Come on.

1650
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:58,946
Hey let's go from here.

1651
01:48:58,973 --> 01:49:02,386
Son, the Block Committee
is above the Village Council.

1652
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:04,151
Go meet Vasudha Tiwari at her office.

1653
01:49:04,412 --> 01:49:08,883
Pradhan, stop misleading the boy.

1654
01:49:09,283 --> 01:49:12,787
And you.. Don't try to
challenge our culture, son.

1655
01:49:12,987 --> 01:49:19,905
[Sanskrit chant]

1656
01:49:20,328 --> 01:49:22,638
Manu has written in the 'Manu-Smriti'.

1657
01:49:22,763 --> 01:49:25,403
One must defecate away from home.

1658
01:49:25,633 --> 01:49:30,639
Tell me, people, did Ram-Sita
build a bathroom in the jungle?

1659
01:49:32,006 --> 01:49:32,848
See this"

1660
01:49:32,906 --> 01:49:35,819
Who's going to complete
that 'Shlok' (verse), headman?

1661
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:39,657
Did you overlook the next page?

1662
01:49:41,515 --> 01:49:48,228
[Sanskrit chant]

1663
01:49:50,324 --> 01:49:52,270
The 'Shloka' also states that...

1664
01:49:52,326 --> 01:49:56,035
...one must not defecate
near a river or any water body.

1665
01:49:57,164 --> 01:50:00,668
And wash their hands afterward.

1666
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:05,347
Forget about washing your hands.
You even clean your <i>a***</i> in the river.

1667
01:50:07,174 --> 01:50:11,179
People like you use religion
according to your own convenience.

1668
01:50:11,545 --> 01:50:12,956
What did you think?

1669
01:50:13,247 --> 01:50:14,590
Just because no one knows Sanskrit...

1670
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:16,253
...you can say anything
you like and get away.

1671
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:19,360
Don't try to teach me the Scriptures,
Village-head.

1672
01:50:19,987 --> 01:50:21,466
And remember...

1673
01:50:22,156 --> 01:50:27,230
Whether my wife comes hack or not, I
will build a bathroom in this village.

1674
01:50:27,861 --> 01:50:29,431
Radhe-Radhe.

1675
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,218
Look, uncle..
- What happened?

1676
01:50:48,249 --> 01:50:50,388
Look at our country's plight.
See here.

1677
01:50:50,517 --> 01:50:53,259
Keshav doesn't know
who he's going up against.

1678
01:50:53,287 --> 01:50:54,960
3000 Cr scam.

1679
01:50:55,122 --> 01:50:56,123
There are no records.

1680
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:58,932
All these scams are four years old.

1681
01:50:59,093 --> 01:51:02,540
Everyone's involved. Read this.

1682
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:04,800
And all these ministers
are involved in this scam.

1683
01:51:04,832 --> 01:51:08,439
Not just the ministers.
Everyone's involved.

1684
01:51:10,838 --> 01:51:13,182
What should I send Keshav?

1685
01:51:15,876 --> 01:51:17,685
Look at these scams.

1686
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:23,952
Wonderful, sister-in-law.

1687
01:51:25,019 --> 01:51:26,430
Read it carefully.

1688
01:51:27,221 --> 01:51:28,723
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1689
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:30,791
Listen.

1690
01:51:30,824 --> 01:51:33,100
If you go to the toilet,
don't forget to lock the door.

1691
01:51:34,662 --> 01:51:37,370
Do that later.. Don't he crazy.
- Go.

1692
01:51:37,531 --> 01:51:38,669
You're too much.

1693
01:51:38,832 --> 01:51:41,335
Give me the file.
- Take it.

1694
01:51:42,436 --> 01:51:43,176
Careful.

1695
01:51:45,473 --> 01:51:46,451
Bye, sister-in-law.

1696
01:51:46,573 --> 01:51:47,574
Bye.
- Love you.

1697
01:52:00,454 --> 01:52:03,401
Mister, where's DM Mathur's room?
- It's this one.

1698
01:52:03,557 --> 01:52:04,934
Hold on...
- Wait..

1699
01:52:04,992 --> 01:52:06,972
It's urgent.
- You can't go inside like this.

1700
01:52:08,562 --> 01:52:10,132
Keshav from Mandgaon.

1701
01:52:10,998 --> 01:52:14,411
I see...so you're Keshav.

1702
01:52:14,435 --> 01:52:15,846
Yes, that's me.
- I read in the newspapers.

1703
01:52:15,936 --> 01:52:18,382
First of all, all that money
that you swindle from the poor...

1704
01:52:18,406 --> 01:52:19,851
...where do you take it out?

1705
01:52:19,873 --> 01:52:21,352
Brother...
- Hold on.

1706
01:52:21,709 --> 01:52:25,680
Where are these... 3000 Cr toilets.
Can you show me?

1707
01:52:25,879 --> 01:52:29,793
I see...the public's awakening.

1708
01:52:30,584 --> 01:52:32,757
Well, finally after all these years...

1709
01:52:32,786 --> 01:52:35,164
...someone came asking
for an explanation.

1710
01:52:35,589 --> 01:52:36,590
What do you want from me?

1711
01:52:36,657 --> 01:52:40,070
Toilets...which the
government promised us.

1712
01:52:40,561 --> 01:52:44,270
Actually...I am going to expose you.

1713
01:52:44,365 --> 01:52:45,605
I see...

1714
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:49,739
See that you don't expose yourselves.

1715
01:52:52,173 --> 01:52:54,585
Take a good look, guys.

1716
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:59,416
This is a barber shop, horse-stable...

1717
01:52:59,447 --> 01:53:01,154
...and this lane's a tailor shop.

1718
01:53:01,248 --> 01:53:03,250
So what does that prove?

1719
01:53:03,384 --> 01:53:05,455
All these are public toilets...

1720
01:53:05,552 --> 01:53:07,759
...which you guys are using
for your personal benefits.

1721
01:53:08,021 --> 01:53:11,127
The government makes toilet schemes...

1722
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:13,100
...hut you guys reject it.

1723
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,467
And you guys don't care.
To hell with the funds.

1724
01:53:15,529 --> 01:53:18,669
We won't build a toilet in our homes.

1725
01:53:20,334 --> 01:53:23,406
Look at this Keshav,
the plan for your home.

1726
01:53:23,738 --> 01:53:24,808
Few of the homes in your village...

1727
01:53:24,838 --> 01:53:26,613
...were built under the government
rehabilitation scheme.

1728
01:53:26,741 --> 01:53:28,118
But the rest are ancestral homes.

1729
01:53:29,143 --> 01:53:32,386
So there was never any
facility for toilets in our home.

1730
01:53:32,413 --> 01:53:35,485
The government installed
sewage lines in your homes.

1731
01:53:35,583 --> 01:53:37,460
But you guys shut it down.

1732
01:53:37,651 --> 01:53:38,891
That's not done.

1733
01:53:39,253 --> 01:53:41,062
The government made arrangements...

1734
01:53:41,289 --> 01:53:45,431
...hut connecting the sewage
with your toilet is your job.

1735
01:53:46,894 --> 01:53:48,896
So who's the villain now?

1736
01:53:50,831 --> 01:53:52,936
You mean we don't have an option now.

1737
01:53:53,067 --> 01:53:54,637
Do you know what's a PIL?

1738
01:53:54,936 --> 01:53:56,745
Public Interest Litigation.

1739
01:53:56,837 --> 01:53:58,009
Go see a lawyer.

1740
01:53:58,172 --> 01:53:59,651
Register a PIL against
the Village Council...

1741
01:53:59,674 --> 01:54:01,551
...that you want a
toilet in your village.

1742
01:54:01,776 --> 01:54:03,619
Well, finally after all these years...

1743
01:54:03,945 --> 01:54:07,654
...at least someone thought
that toilet is a problem.

1744
01:54:08,549 --> 01:54:10,620
Actually sir, until the
problem doesn't get personal...

1745
01:54:10,651 --> 01:54:13,393
...no lane's prepared to fight...
or find a solution.

1746
01:54:23,531 --> 01:54:25,010
Sir, can I come in?
- Come.

1747
01:54:48,656 --> 01:54:50,602
Uncle, show me your face.
- Yes.

1748
01:54:50,624 --> 01:54:51,762
Uncle.
- Taking my picture. Wait...

1749
01:54:51,793 --> 01:54:53,101
Taking my picture. Wait...
- Uncle.

1750
01:54:53,427 --> 01:54:54,735
I took this picture at the turn.

1751
01:54:55,696 --> 01:54:57,972
This is a barber-shop,
this one is a tailor-shop.

1752
01:54:57,998 --> 01:55:00,444
This one is a cowshed,
Isn't this what the lawyer said?

1753
01:55:16,918 --> 01:55:20,127
Sir, I've brought all the proof.
What should we do next?

1754
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:39,640
This will get the job done.

1755
01:55:40,007 --> 01:55:43,011
I'll get a sanction from the government
get a toilet built in Mandgaon

1756
01:55:43,244 --> 01:55:44,245
Okay?
- Yes.

1757
01:55:44,845 --> 01:55:47,257
It will take 11 months.

1758
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:50,652
Well, that's almost a year.

1759
01:55:50,718 --> 01:55:52,698
It's the government...

1760
01:55:52,953 --> 01:55:54,694
...works at its own pace.

1761
01:55:54,755 --> 01:55:57,133
All these years you
lived without a toilet.

1762
01:55:57,358 --> 01:55:58,962
Another yea r. Right.

1763
01:56:01,161 --> 01:56:04,734
I can live without a
toilet but without my wife.

1764
01:56:08,068 --> 01:56:11,242
Remember who's the villain,
in this case, Keshav.

1765
01:56:11,739 --> 01:56:13,719
You're challenging our culture.

1766
01:56:14,542 --> 01:56:15,543
Understood!

1767
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:19,516
And it's not easy to win over culture.

1768
01:56:19,747 --> 01:56:21,454
This is a difficult trial.

1769
01:56:22,049 --> 01:56:26,122
In this country, fighting
against culture is not an easy task.

1770
01:56:33,994 --> 01:56:36,804
Brother, I have an idea now...

1771
01:56:37,665 --> 01:56:40,145
...what this culture is
everyone's ranting about.

1772
01:56:40,167 --> 01:56:41,237
Who is it?

1773
01:56:42,169 --> 01:56:45,548
Culture is something
no one's seen or heard of...

1774
01:56:45,573 --> 01:56:47,553
...yet, everyone's clinging on to it.

1775
01:56:48,042 --> 01:56:51,216
Culture is what makes us put donation
boxes in temples and mosques...

1776
01:56:51,312 --> 01:56:54,521
...hut makes humans defecate
out in the open like animals.

1777
01:56:54,582 --> 01:56:55,788
That's culture.

1778
01:57:01,422 --> 01:57:04,801
[Chanting Prayer]

1779
01:57:19,941 --> 01:57:21,716
What is he doing?

1780
01:57:36,624 --> 01:57:38,297
This is a pandit's home after all.

1781
01:57:38,693 --> 01:57:41,401
So veneration is a must
before starting any good deed.

1782
01:57:41,929 --> 01:57:43,067
For the sake of your happiness.

1783
01:57:43,230 --> 01:57:45,176
What good deed, son?

1784
01:57:45,265 --> 01:57:46,744
Laying the foundation stone, grandma.

1785
01:57:47,501 --> 01:57:48,946
I'm building a toilet in our home.

1786
01:57:49,937 --> 01:57:51,939
Now, change your thinking, father.

1787
01:57:52,406 --> 01:57:54,249
And stop peeing out in the gutter.

1788
01:57:57,177 --> 01:57:58,247
Okay, son.

1789
01:58:00,014 --> 01:58:01,516
You've crossed all limits.

1790
01:58:02,116 --> 01:58:03,322
Do as you please.

1791
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:08,100
I won't eat a morsel of food now.

1792
01:58:08,189 --> 01:58:10,260
Great, no food, no stress.

1804

Can I give you an idea?
- What?

1805
01:59:07,048 --> 01:59:08,493
Leave the bathroom uncovered.

1806
01:59:09,416 --> 01:59:10,053
Why?

1807
01:59:10,184 --> 01:59:11,993
Are you going to
bury Anarkali in here?

1808
01:59:12,119 --> 01:59:14,030
Go on...hurry up.

1809
01:59:15,389 --> 01:59:16,527
Father...

1810
01:59:18,225 --> 01:59:21,229
Father, your meal..
Please eat your meal.

Don't come in front of me.

1851

What happened, brother?
- Naru, the calamity's been averted.

A Brahmin's home was
saved from getting tainted.

Nothing is ever going to change here.

If You" get a sprain, apply <i>s***</i>

1856

If shitting and toilets
are such a had thing...

1857
02:03:28,275 --> 02:03:29,913
...then why did God give us a stomach?

1858
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:31,751
No stomach, no loo.

1859
02:03:32,413 --> 02:03:36,088
Headman, open your
scriptures and tell me...

1860
02:03:36,484 --> 02:03:39,431
Is it our moral obligation
to make a spectacle out of our wife...

1861
02:03:39,453 --> 02:03:41,296
...or does <i>sh***</i> out in
the open give us salvation?

1862
02:03:41,622 --> 02:03:42,692
Tell me!

1863
02:03:48,362 --> 02:03:52,811
Savri...you don't feel
embarrassed having six kids.

1864
02:03:52,933 --> 02:03:55,436
But you feel embarrassed
to talk about toilets.

1865
02:03:56,470 --> 02:04:00,475
People like them associate
shame with religion.

1866
02:04:00,508 --> 02:04:01,714
You people.

1867
02:04:02,076 --> 02:04:03,555
You should he ashamed.

1868
02:04:09,083 --> 02:04:11,825
Panditji...you were so embarrassed...

1869
02:04:11,852 --> 02:04:14,196
...to read about your
daughter-in-law in the newspaper.

1870
02:04:14,222 --> 02:04:17,101
But no shame in peeing
out in the gutter.

1871
02:04:17,424 --> 02:04:20,030
It's quite obvious
that the women are fleeing.

1872
02:04:20,361 --> 02:04:23,001
We're stuck in this
blind game of religion.

1873
02:04:23,263 --> 02:04:29,908
Pretty soon...no one will ever
give you their daughter's hand again.

1874
02:04:30,103 --> 02:04:32,413
Everyone will die as bachelors.

1875
02:04:35,543 --> 02:04:36,749
Go on...

1876
02:04:37,011 --> 02:04:40,823
Go home... celebrate.

1877
02:04:41,348 --> 02:04:43,350
Tell stories to your children...

1878
02:04:44,018 --> 02:04:47,932
About how we bravehearts
broke Keshav's Taj Mahal Mahal Mahal!

1879
02:04:47,955 --> 02:04:50,526
Go on... tell them!

1880
02:05:05,506 --> 02:05:06,951
Grandma...

1881
02:05:07,741 --> 02:05:11,348
Grandma... set the plate for your son.

1882
02:05:11,578 --> 02:05:13,649
He'll break his fast today.

1883
02:05:14,081 --> 02:05:15,992
He just broke the entire house.

1884
02:05:19,686 --> 02:05:21,393
He broke everything.

1885
02:05:28,863 --> 02:05:36,863
"I feel so unfortunate."

1886
02:05:44,345 --> 02:05:52,345
"I don't deserve you"

1887
02:05:59,727 --> 02:06:07,727
"Nothing's more..."
"complicated than love."

1888
02:06:15,676 --> 02:06:19,488
Yeah, Jaya. I tried everything.

1889
02:06:21,015 --> 02:06:23,222
We must wait for 11 months.

1890
02:06:23,684 --> 02:06:24,958
No, Keshav.

1891
02:06:26,554 --> 02:06:28,465
Don't call me again.

1892
02:06:30,291 --> 02:06:33,738
And if you think I am joking,
then don't he mistaken.

1893
02:06:33,895 --> 02:06:35,067
I have an idea.

1894
02:06:44,472 --> 02:06:46,179
I'll get the Goswami Road fixed.

1895
02:06:46,507 --> 02:06:48,180
I'll get it fixed from my quota.

1896
02:06:48,242 --> 02:06:49,687
Look what's published
in the newspaper, village-head.

1897
02:06:49,743 --> 02:06:50,744
Calamity has befallen on our village.

1898
02:06:50,811 --> 02:06:52,290
Divorce for a toilet.

1899
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:54,091
Our village has been jinxed.

1900
02:06:54,448 --> 02:06:55,654
This is a complete disaster.

1901
02:06:56,918 --> 02:06:59,592
Our village will he disgraced
in the entire district.

1902
02:06:59,954 --> 02:07:02,764
Too much education isn't good either.

1903
02:07:04,091 --> 02:07:05,502
This is really had.

1904
02:07:06,126 --> 02:07:07,730
Brother Keshav is doomed.

1905
02:07:07,862 --> 02:07:10,775
Where can he go?
He can't stay in this village anymore.

1906
02:07:10,931 --> 02:07:13,673
There's been no divorce in
our village for the last 1700 years.

1907
02:07:13,801 --> 02:07:15,781
This is really terrible, Panditji.

1908
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:17,414
What can I say?

1909
02:07:18,339 --> 02:07:20,580
I never imagined I'll
ever hear this word in my life.

1910
02:07:21,508 --> 02:07:22,782
She wants a divorce.

1911
02:07:23,143 --> 02:07:24,588
Does she think it's a joke?

1912
02:07:25,179 --> 02:07:28,092
Sir, isn't he the same
Keshav who came to meet you?

1913
02:07:30,417 --> 02:07:33,455
No, he's the same 'Keshav'
who started 'Mahabharata'.

1914
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:35,929
That 'Keshav' matter
is getting a lot of attention.

1915
02:07:35,956 --> 02:07:37,629
We're here to interview his wife.

1916
02:07:37,658 --> 02:07:38,966
I'll tell you once I get there.

1917
02:07:40,561 --> 02:07:42,598
Keep the bathroom in the background.

1918
02:07:43,531 --> 02:07:45,670
This story is about
Jaya from Sabrana village...

1919
02:07:45,766 --> 02:07:49,339
...who is going to divorce her husband
just 6 months after their wedding.

1920
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,915
Reason; toilet.

1921
02:07:54,375 --> 02:07:58,118
Jaya, are you actually divorcing
your husband for a toilet?

1922
02:07:59,647 --> 02:08:01,593
Don't you think this
reason is good enough?

1923
02:08:01,782 --> 02:08:04,092
You've been here since morning.
You came all the way from Delhi.

1924
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:05,695
Did you use the bathroom?

1925
02:08:05,986 --> 02:08:08,398
Actually,
we have a vanity van, which has a...

1926
02:08:08,422 --> 02:08:10,800
That's why you think
this is not an actual problem.

1927
02:08:10,825 --> 02:08:14,329
I advise you to stay here one night.
Go out with IOTA party.

1928
02:08:14,729 --> 02:08:16,936
Sit out in the open amongst snakes,
scorpions and other animals.

1929
02:08:17,298 --> 02:08:19,300
And then you'll realize my problem.

1930
02:08:19,633 --> 02:08:22,739
See...she's openly describing
her deeds on television.

1931
02:08:23,504 --> 02:08:26,485
Keshav, do you think that
the government is responsible?

1932
02:08:26,774 --> 02:08:29,084
Honestly, we're to he blamed first.

1933
02:08:29,343 --> 02:08:32,017
The scam happened because
we didn't want a toilet.

1934
02:08:32,246 --> 02:08:33,748
We love our fields.

1935
02:08:34,114 --> 02:08:37,425
And the government distributed
free notebooks to the children...

1936
02:08:37,451 --> 02:08:39,727
...hut didn't tell them
what to write in them.

1937
02:08:40,187 --> 02:08:42,633
They built toilets,
but didn't teach anyone how to use it.

1938
02:08:42,823 --> 02:08:45,497
This is the government's
responsibility as well.

1939
02:08:45,693 --> 02:08:47,468
They only carried
out half of their tasks.

1940
02:08:47,728 --> 02:08:49,935
But the government has been
promoting this campaign a lot.

1941
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:53,439
And built around 6 million
toilets in the last three years.

1942
02:08:53,834 --> 02:08:55,142
They built toilets..

1943
02:08:55,335 --> 02:08:57,815
...hut it's high time the government
made certain laws as well.

1944
02:08:58,139 --> 02:08:59,379
What laws?

1945
02:08:59,507 --> 02:09:01,919
Use toilets for defecating.

1946
02:09:02,576 --> 02:09:04,783
Keshav, you built
a toilet in your home.

1947
02:09:04,912 --> 02:09:06,289
Who broke that?

1948
02:09:06,547 --> 02:09:10,757
The men of our country feel really
proud to do it out in the open.

1949
02:09:11,552 --> 02:09:15,090
Some narrow-minded
guy broke my toilet.

1950
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:19,064
So...
- Actually, it was my father.

1951
02:09:20,027 --> 02:09:22,439
So you mean to say you'll
never do it out in the open again.

1952
02:09:22,730 --> 02:09:25,643
Well, hack in the days
I would stand anywhere.

1953
02:09:25,733 --> 02:09:28,543
But now I'll only
stand up for a bathroom.

1954
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:32,149
You must have faced a lot
of humiliation for this divorce.

1955
02:09:32,172 --> 02:09:34,812
If I make a mistake,
I'm hound to get insulted.

1956
02:09:35,209 --> 02:09:36,882
There must he a toilet in the house.

1957
02:09:37,145 --> 02:09:39,625
There must he a toilet
in the house for the women.

1958
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:41,760
So that, men can stop
them from wandering outside.

1959
02:09:41,782 --> 02:09:44,763
Wonderful, madam. Such a twisted
question for such a simple answer.

1960
02:09:45,052 --> 02:09:47,123
Are you from foreign channel?

1961
02:09:47,554 --> 02:09:50,467
Real freedom isn't about
going out to defecate.

1962
02:09:50,558 --> 02:09:53,937
It's about going out
on your own free will.

1963
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:56,805
But who will explain to these idiots?

1964
02:09:57,264 --> 02:10:00,473
Our fight is against...this.
Their views.

1965
02:10:00,701 --> 02:10:01,907
Their views.

1966
02:10:02,169 --> 02:10:05,548
But if you lose this fight,
you can lose your wife too.

1967
02:10:05,706 --> 02:10:07,811
I can lose her in
the open jungle as well.

1968
02:10:08,042 --> 02:10:10,420
I would rather lose her like this.

1969
02:10:11,111 --> 02:10:12,556
It's quite simple, madam.

1970
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:16,221
If you want your wife,
you got to have a toilet.

1971
02:10:21,789 --> 02:10:24,395
Jaya, who do you think
is responsible for this divorce.

1972
02:10:24,591 --> 02:10:26,628
The government or our tradition.

1973
02:10:27,361 --> 02:10:31,366
The women...who'll set
out again tomorrow at dawn.

1974
02:10:36,070 --> 02:10:40,177
Jaya from Sabrana village is still
steadfast on her decision of a divorce.

1975
02:10:40,241 --> 02:10:42,847
Will this affect the
government officials in anyway?

1976
02:10:44,345 --> 02:10:46,655
There's going to he a war.

1977
02:10:52,687 --> 02:10:55,725
All our past scams
will get exposed, Yadav.

1978
02:10:55,756 --> 02:10:56,962
DO You get it?

1979
02:10:58,425 --> 02:11:00,905
I guess even we'll have
to bathe out in the open now.

1980
02:11:00,928 --> 02:11:02,532
I can see stars in daylight, sir.

1981
02:11:02,596 --> 02:11:03,574
I told you before...

1982
02:11:03,664 --> 02:11:04,734
You should've carried
out a part of the work.

1983
02:11:04,899 --> 02:11:05,969
Now the CM's called for a meeting.

1984
02:11:06,166 --> 02:11:08,112
This is wrong, Swamiji.

1985
02:11:08,269 --> 02:11:09,612
This country will never progress.

1986
02:11:09,637 --> 02:11:11,878
What was the result of this movement?

1987
02:11:12,173 --> 02:11:17,418
Build toilets! Build toilets!

1988
02:11:18,245 --> 02:11:19,724
Calm down!

1989
02:11:20,981 --> 02:11:22,790
Our country is going backwards.

1990
02:11:24,652 --> 02:11:27,064
Well, there's been some
activity within the government.

1991
02:11:27,387 --> 02:11:30,197
From 11 months,
its come down to 10 months.

1992
02:11:30,558 --> 02:11:34,301
If the government functions any faster
then it will definitely collapse.

1993
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,847
I'm a Brahmin too.

1994
02:11:48,509 --> 02:11:52,480
I'll have water as well as tea.

1995
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,884
Yes, I'll get it.

1996
02:11:57,952 --> 02:11:59,329
Tell me something, Pandit.

1997
02:12:00,154 --> 02:12:02,430
Do you watch Sunny Leone's movies?

1998
02:12:03,524 --> 02:12:05,265
Radhe-Radhe.

1999
02:12:07,561 --> 02:12:09,973
Is this what you wanted to ask?

2000
02:12:10,564 --> 02:12:13,135
You've been living
alone for so many years.

2001
02:12:14,334 --> 02:12:16,780
I'm sure you watch it secretly.

2002
02:12:18,039 --> 02:12:20,212
This was expected from you.

2003
02:12:20,441 --> 02:12:22,648
One can see your values
reflecting in your daughter.

2004
02:12:22,810 --> 02:12:24,016
That's true.

2005
02:12:24,478 --> 02:12:27,823
We taught her to speak up,
instead of staying quiet.

2006
02:12:29,083 --> 02:12:32,997
Your values about entering
this house with the help of a lie.

2007
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:37,100
The values of maligning the family honor
by giving an interview on television.

2008
02:12:37,358 --> 02:12:41,329
And complicating a
simple issue like a toilet.

2009
02:12:41,629 --> 02:12:43,472
Even you admit it's
an uncomplicated issue.

2010
02:12:43,497 --> 02:12:45,602
So build a toilet at home too.

2011
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:47,374
I see...

2012
02:12:47,768 --> 02:12:49,873
So you want us to build a toilet...

2013
02:12:49,970 --> 02:12:51,449
...in the same courtyard
where we Pray to 'Tulsi'.

2014
02:12:51,472 --> 02:12:53,452
Unbelievable, Panditji.

2015
02:12:54,208 --> 02:12:56,119
You Pray to the Ganga as well.

2016
02:12:56,477 --> 02:12:58,718
But don't you wash
your sins in it too?

2017
02:12:59,246 --> 02:13:00,748
You won't build a
toilet in your home...

2018
02:13:00,948 --> 02:13:02,950
...hut, you've turned the
entire country into a big loo.

2019
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:07,897
You can open your zipper, or untie
your draw-strings wherever you like.

2020
02:13:08,188 --> 02:13:10,498
Change with time.

2021
02:13:11,792 --> 02:13:12,896
Change?

2022
02:13:13,761 --> 02:13:15,365
And forget our culture.

2023
02:13:15,462 --> 02:13:19,308
People like you have reduced
culture to just 'Sanskrit.'

2024
02:13:19,333 --> 02:13:22,906
Joshi...we live for our culture...

2025
02:13:23,304 --> 02:13:26,342
...and we Pandits can
even die for our culture.

2026
02:13:27,141 --> 02:13:28,950
I know you got Japanese degrees...

2027
02:13:29,076 --> 02:13:31,078
...hut, have you ever
read the holy scriptures?

2028
02:13:31,946 --> 02:13:35,553
Lord Krishna addressed
a grave problem in Gita.

2029
02:13:35,783 --> 02:13:39,253
The world fights with each other but
only the brave fights with himself.

2030
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:42,564
If you can conquer
over yourself, Pandit...

2031
02:13:43,090 --> 02:13:46,333
...then, you can save the children's
world from falling apart.

2032
02:13:48,829 --> 02:13:50,331
And remember...

2033
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:55,408
If you change nothing,
nothing will chance.

2034
02:13:56,103 --> 02:13:57,480
Radhe-Radhe.

2035
02:14:12,252 --> 02:14:14,493
There's nothing more
we can do, Keshav.

2036
02:14:15,957 --> 02:14:19,803
We failed to rattle the government
or change father's opinion.

2037
02:14:22,229 --> 02:14:24,675
All our plans backfired.

2038
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:28,906
Even our plans of getting
a 'divorce' failed.

2039
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:37,314
So what?

2040
02:14:39,647 --> 02:14:43,220
Tomorrow morning we'll go to the court
and withdraw our divorce petition.

2041
02:14:45,653 --> 02:14:47,564
We'll leave our home...

2042
02:14:47,922 --> 02:14:49,799
...and build our own little abode.

2043
02:14:51,425 --> 02:14:53,666
I cannot break your home, Keshav.

2044
02:14:59,066 --> 02:15:01,205
But I can break this marriage.

2045
02:15:09,377 --> 02:15:11,584
This isn't just my fight alone.

2046
02:15:14,381 --> 02:15:17,487
Every daughter,
every woman has her eyes on me.

2047
02:15:19,086 --> 02:15:20,394
If I give up now...

2048
02:15:20,421 --> 02:15:23,027
...no woman will ever
fight for her right again.

2049
02:15:28,262 --> 02:15:29,935
See...now you sound like a leader.

2050
02:15:35,135 --> 02:15:36,136
Sorry...

2051
02:15:38,239 --> 02:15:40,150
I couldn't he your wife.

2052
02:15:40,674 --> 02:15:45,680
You became my wife the day you served
father dinner after the entire fiasco...

2053
02:15:45,813 --> 02:15:47,918
...and even went out to the fields.

2054
02:15:50,050 --> 02:15:51,723
And today...when you're
prepared to leave me...

2055
02:15:51,752 --> 02:15:53,322
...to bring a change in this country.

2056
02:15:57,124 --> 02:16:00,697
That's more like Keshav's wife.

2057
02:16:04,031 --> 02:16:06,068
And as far as our
divorce is concerned...

2058
02:16:06,367 --> 02:16:07,471
Give me your phone.

2059
02:16:10,838 --> 02:16:12,010
Here...

2060
02:16:12,206 --> 02:16:14,208
I've deleted your number.

2061
02:16:17,578 --> 02:16:19,922
I can even walk the gallows for you.

2062
02:16:20,948 --> 02:16:22,928
Divorce is a very small step.

2063
02:16:26,187 --> 02:16:28,189
See you tomorrow at the family court.

2064
02:16:29,456 --> 02:16:30,491
Radhe-Radhe.

2065
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:37,909
Come on...I'll drop you home.

2066
02:16:40,868 --> 02:16:43,109
I swear I won't elope with you.
Come on.

2067
02:16:44,304 --> 02:16:52,121
"Quit smiling,
silly, or I'll fall in love."

2068
02:16:57,885 --> 02:17:03,426
"I used to feel...love's too
far-fetched for me..."

2069
02:17:03,724 --> 02:17:09,037
“...because I have no dreams.“

2070
02:17:09,230 --> 02:17:14,441
"I am completely lost in your eyes."

2071
02:17:14,502 --> 02:17:19,645
"Like sandalwood dissolves in water."

2072
02:17:19,674 --> 02:17:27,674
"The heart's willing to do anything."

2073
02:17:28,216 --> 02:17:35,725
"Quit smiling,
silly, or I'll fall in love."

2074
02:17:40,461 --> 02:17:43,203
These days if there's an
argument the wife quits home.

2075
02:17:43,731 --> 02:17:45,642
Even if the husband's Hrithik Roshan.

2076
02:17:46,167 --> 02:17:47,771
You're absolutely right.

2077
02:17:47,935 --> 02:17:49,710
That Joshi's daughter didn't give up.

2078
02:17:49,937 --> 02:17:51,439
She's going to the court...

2079
02:17:51,706 --> 02:17:53,708
They might even get divorced.

2080
02:17:53,808 --> 02:17:57,346
Honestly speaking, her husband
really loved her. - Yes.

2081
02:17:57,411 --> 02:17:59,914
Didn't you see...he
tried his level best.

2082
02:17:59,947 --> 02:18:01,221
But to what avail?

2083
02:18:01,315 --> 02:18:03,226
Just another charade without a reason.

2084
02:18:03,384 --> 02:18:05,261
For such small things who creates
an issue. She only made a scene.

2085
02:18:05,486 --> 02:18:08,763
Who runs away from home and demands
divorce for such trivial issues?

2086
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:11,161
I thought her demand was valid.

2087
02:18:11,225 --> 02:18:13,102
What did she ask for?

2088
02:18:13,327 --> 02:18:15,534
Poor thing wasn't used
to going out in the open...

2089
02:18:15,563 --> 02:18:16,337
...what else could she have done?

2090
02:18:16,364 --> 02:18:19,208
So now she can sit
in her toilet proudly.

2091
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,137
And us?

2092
02:18:28,242 --> 02:18:30,779
We'll keep going out...like we do.

2093
02:18:34,215 --> 02:18:37,958
You know...what would've happened
if we had made the same demand?

2094
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:40,924
Don't talk to me in Jaya's tone.

2095
02:18:41,422 --> 02:18:42,526
What happened?

2096
02:18:43,023 --> 02:18:44,832
She only brought
disgrace to our village.

2097
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:47,667
Come on...serve dinner.
- I didn't cook dinner.

2098
02:18:47,694 --> 02:18:48,968
What do you mean
you didn't cook dinner?

2099
02:18:49,196 --> 02:18:51,369
If we eat, we'll have to go.

2100
02:18:51,699 --> 02:18:53,701
No food, no going out.

2101
02:18:54,001 --> 02:18:55,412
Have you lost your mind?

2102
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:58,680
Actually, it all makes sense now.

2103
02:19:33,941 --> 02:19:37,013
Vimu...
- Who?

2104
02:19:37,144 --> 02:19:38,589
Oh, my...
- Mother!

2105
02:19:38,679 --> 02:19:42,217
Oh, my...
- Mother!

2106
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:44,422
What happened?

2107
02:19:45,319 --> 02:19:47,526
What happened?
- I think I broke a hone.

2108
02:19:47,588 --> 02:19:49,192
But how did you fall down?

2109
02:19:49,289 --> 02:19:51,599
Someone spilled oil here.
- Oil?

2110
02:19:51,625 --> 02:19:53,662
I was going towards the field.

2111
02:19:53,828 --> 02:19:55,739
Quickly, take me to the field.

2112
02:19:55,796 --> 02:19:58,106
Hurry up... quickly. Pick me up.

2113
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:00,606
Mother...

2114
02:20:01,201 --> 02:20:04,341
Mother... - No.. I don't think
I can walk all the way to the field.

2115
02:20:04,405 --> 02:20:07,716
And I can't control it any longer either.
- Mother..

2116
02:20:07,775 --> 02:20:10,688
Quickly...lift me up.
- Mother"

2117
02:20:13,146 --> 02:20:15,319
Can I go in there?

2118
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:23,397
What are you thinking?
Your mother is dying!

2119
02:20:24,691 --> 02:20:27,365
Quickly...lift me up.

2120
02:20:27,428 --> 02:20:29,374
Mother, no.. No..

2121
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:31,910
Lift me up.

2122
02:20:31,965 --> 02:20:35,538
Lift me up. Oh, God! Oh, God!

2123
02:20:37,604 --> 02:20:38,275
Careful.

2124
02:20:38,305 --> 02:20:41,286
Quickly, take me. Take me, son.

2125
02:20:41,475 --> 02:20:45,651
Take me quickly. Oh, God!

2126
02:22:09,163 --> 02:22:14,078
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2127
02:22:14,101 --> 02:22:19,312
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2128
02:22:19,473 --> 02:22:21,316
If Jaya Joshi gets a divorce...

2129
02:22:21,408 --> 02:22:22,978
...then, we'll all get a divorce.

2130
02:22:23,043 --> 02:22:27,822
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2131
02:22:28,248 --> 02:22:29,989
We'll fight. Take down our request.

2132
02:22:30,050 --> 02:22:31,085
This is not the way.

2133
02:22:31,151 --> 02:22:33,256
Why don't you understand?
This is not how you get a divorce.

2134
02:22:33,287 --> 02:22:34,857
I request you, please go away.

2135
02:22:34,988 --> 02:22:36,661
We also want a divorce.
- Just go from here.

2136
02:22:36,991 --> 02:22:39,301
We've all heard about
mass marriages...

2137
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:41,498
...hut never about mass
divorce before today.

2138
02:22:41,528 --> 02:22:43,599
One reason; toilet.

2139
02:22:43,964 --> 02:22:46,410
This is a challenge to the government.

2140
02:22:47,067 --> 02:22:48,546
Verma.
- Yes, sir.

2141
02:22:48,836 --> 02:22:49,906
What is this?

2142
02:22:49,937 --> 02:22:52,076
Bureaucracy, sir.

2143
02:22:52,206 --> 02:22:53,981
From society welfare
committee to the village...

2144
02:22:54,008 --> 02:22:56,181
...the files have to
go through seven offices.

2145
02:22:56,310 --> 02:22:58,290
And they all have their...

2146
02:22:58,345 --> 02:22:59,380
Understood!

2147
02:22:59,679 --> 02:23:01,420
Verma, do one thing today.

2148
02:23:01,749 --> 02:23:03,092
Then buy seven locks...

2149
02:23:03,451 --> 02:23:07,126
...and lock all the
toilets in those offices.

2150
02:23:07,187 --> 02:23:10,168
Sir.. - No one will go
to the toilet for seven days.

2151
02:23:10,491 --> 02:23:12,869
Those who want to go will
have to find a solution himself.

2152
02:23:13,193 --> 02:23:14,171
But, sir..

2153
02:23:14,261 --> 02:23:18,710
Only the wounded knows the pain,
and no one else.

2154
02:23:18,866 --> 02:23:20,470
But, sir, how is that possible?

2155
02:23:20,834 --> 02:23:25,044
If our Prime Minister can ban notes
for the country's benefit...

2156
02:23:25,105 --> 02:23:28,951
...then we can close toilets too.

2157
02:23:29,443 --> 02:23:30,444
Yes, sir.

2158
02:23:57,538 --> 02:24:00,348
Jaya Joshi left her husband's
home on 15th February.

2159
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:03,114
And today they are meeting
directly in the court.

2160
02:24:03,577 --> 02:24:07,787
And the reason for their separation
is the 3000 Cr toilet scam.

2161
02:24:07,848 --> 02:24:10,089
We've never had a divorce
in the last 1700 years.

2162
02:24:10,183 --> 02:24:12,220
If Lord Krishna returns to Radha...

2163
02:24:12,253 --> 02:24:13,960
...will Rukmini divorce Him?

2164
02:24:14,121 --> 02:24:15,828
Quarrels should he solved at home.

2165
02:24:15,856 --> 02:24:17,961
And not made a public spectacle.
- You're right.

2166
02:24:18,025 --> 02:24:21,598
No one's ever said that
we should use a toilet...

2167
02:24:21,795 --> 02:24:23,297
...then what is this feud all about?

2168
02:24:23,364 --> 02:24:25,674
I wish Keshav had understood
the chapter on Manusmriti...

2169
02:24:25,799 --> 02:24:27,801
...then he wouldn't
he facing this problem.

2170
02:24:27,868 --> 02:24:30,940
Seems like people are
against building toilets.

2171
02:24:31,038 --> 02:24:33,518
They believe it's
against their culture.

2172
02:24:33,607 --> 02:24:34,711
You tell me...

2173
02:24:34,909 --> 02:24:37,321
What about the Prime Minister's
'Cleanliness Drive'?

2174
02:24:37,411 --> 02:24:40,517
If we build a toilet at home
then how can we keep our homes clean?

2175
02:24:40,714 --> 02:24:43,251
So that's their opinion
about the 'Cleanliness Drive'.

2176
02:24:43,317 --> 02:24:45,957
A village where toilets
are deemed unhygienic...

2177
02:24:45,986 --> 02:24:47,897
...are hound to have such divorces.

2178
02:24:54,428 --> 02:24:55,463
Hello.

2179
02:25:17,851 --> 02:25:19,524
Madam, sign on this urgently.

2180
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:24,860
Madam...madam...
- Hold on.

2181
02:25:24,891 --> 02:25:26,937
Jaya...
- What is it?

2182
02:25:26,961 --> 02:25:29,464
Will it he easy for your daughter to
live in the village after this divorce?

2183
02:25:29,630 --> 02:25:30,335
Why?

2184
02:25:30,431 --> 02:25:32,342
Is she causing floods or doomsday?

2185
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:35,380
No, I... - Did anyone in your
family ever have a divorce before?

2186
02:25:35,469 --> 02:25:37,312
Forget my family,
let's talk about the country.

2187
02:25:37,371 --> 02:25:39,317
Did anyone ever have
a divorce for a toilet?

2188
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:40,884
My daughter will set an example.
Come along.

2189
02:25:40,908 --> 02:25:43,184
Do you think divorce is
the solution to this problem?

2190
02:25:43,276 --> 02:25:44,914
It is the solution to my problems.

2191
02:25:45,279 --> 02:25:47,190
One more question...
- That's enough... Come on, move aside.

2192
02:25:47,214 --> 02:25:49,888
Sir-sir...you tried your
level best to save your marriage.

2193
02:25:49,950 --> 02:25:51,395
But, if this is only
about a toilet then..

2194
02:25:51,418 --> 02:25:52,954
...why didn't you
go live with your wife?

2195
02:25:53,253 --> 02:25:54,630
Yes, that's a nice idea.

2196
02:25:54,888 --> 02:25:56,731
But I don't know how
to run from my problems.

2197
02:25:56,790 --> 02:25:58,292
Sir, it's not that sunny...

2198
02:25:58,325 --> 02:25:59,827
...yet you're wearing sunglasses.

2199
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:01,496
Are you trying to hide your tears?

2200
02:26:01,595 --> 02:26:04,940
Look, madam,
everyone's blinded by fake pride.

2201
02:26:05,165 --> 02:26:06,667
And anyway, these are fake Rayhans.

2202
02:26:06,967 --> 02:26:08,446
But the world has
a real one on their eyes.

2203
02:26:08,535 --> 02:26:10,572
Are you going to challenge
the government after this?

2204
02:26:11,104 --> 02:26:14,642
It's your job to blame
the government for everything.

2205
02:26:15,109 --> 02:26:17,146
You should take some
responsibilities yourself.

2206
02:26:17,244 --> 02:26:19,451
Keshav, are you sad that
your wife's leaving you?

2207
02:26:19,579 --> 02:26:20,956
No, I love it.

2208
02:26:21,215 --> 02:26:22,819
Now I'll get a new wife for myself.

2209
02:26:22,917 --> 02:26:23,918
Come on, that's enough.
- Sir, just one more question.

2210
02:26:23,951 --> 02:26:25,760
Sir.. Sir.. Please sir.
- That's enough.

2211
02:26:28,255 --> 02:26:29,495
I feel that everything will he fine.

2212
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:31,433
They don't know how to talk.

2213
02:26:31,492 --> 02:26:33,631
I mean... - These people
are getting divorced as well.

2214
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:35,230
I don't know.

2215
02:26:35,629 --> 02:26:37,404
Radhe-Radhe.
- Greetings. Greetings.

2216
02:26:45,806 --> 02:26:49,151
We didn't have so many
guests even at our wedding.

2217
02:26:50,544 --> 02:26:52,854
I haven't seen our wedding video yet.

2218
02:26:53,547 --> 02:26:56,153
But our divorce is being broadcast
live on national television.

2219
02:26:59,553 --> 02:27:01,294
Fix your hair, sweetheart.

2220
02:27:04,825 --> 02:27:07,203
Quit smiling silly, I'll fall in love.

2221
02:27:18,639 --> 02:27:20,641
Time now for a small break.

2222
02:27:20,707 --> 02:27:23,779
On the other side of the break we'll
show you Jaya and Keshav's signatures.

2223
02:27:23,811 --> 02:27:26,485
Stay with us on Abhi
Tak Channel, live.

2224
02:27:26,747 --> 02:27:29,921
After this divorce, the people
are going to divorce this government.

2225
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:32,294
Because this is their biggest failure.

2226
02:27:32,419 --> 02:27:35,457
Judging by the size of this issue, this
was a controversy waiting to happen.

2227
02:27:35,589 --> 02:27:38,092
If what Keshav and Jaya are doing...

2228
02:27:38,158 --> 02:27:41,105
...ushers in a change
then it's always welcome.

2229
02:27:41,228 --> 02:27:43,868
You see, I was the first one
to report this news in my newspaper.

2230
02:27:44,031 --> 02:27:46,170
But I never thought it
would escalate to divorce.

2231
02:27:46,333 --> 02:27:48,472
It's all due to the narrow-mindedness
of these ignorant.

2232
02:27:48,669 --> 02:27:50,842
But brother Keshav tried his best.

2233
02:28:16,097 --> 02:28:18,338
Jaya and Keshav.

2234
02:28:21,535 --> 02:28:23,981
Do you two still stand
firm on your decision?

2235
02:28:28,108 --> 02:28:29,246
Yes...

2236
02:28:29,310 --> 02:28:32,086
No toilet, no marriage.

2237
02:28:45,459 --> 02:28:48,133
Sir, this letter has arrived
from the CM's office.

2238
02:28:59,039 --> 02:29:04,489
The court rejects Jaya
and Keshav's plea for divorce.

2239
02:29:11,351 --> 02:29:14,298
The government has
accepted Keshav's request...

2240
02:29:14,354 --> 02:29:17,164
...for building a
toilet in his village.

2241
02:29:25,599 --> 02:29:30,912
The construction begins tomorrow morning
on the ground outside the village.

2242
02:29:31,105 --> 02:29:36,282
Until then...the villagers
will he facilitated with porta-loo.

2243
02:29:40,614 --> 02:29:42,321
Why are you sulking?
- Nothing.

2244
02:29:42,383 --> 02:29:44,294
Congratulations, brother.

2245
02:29:44,518 --> 02:29:47,328
The file which went nowhere in 12
months got sanctioned in 12 minutes.

2246
02:29:47,354 --> 02:29:49,356
And do you know what
the Chief Minister did?

2247
02:29:49,456 --> 02:29:52,232
He locked all the toilets
in every government office.

2248
02:29:52,292 --> 02:29:54,431
That's when these officers
learned their lesson.

2249
02:29:54,628 --> 02:29:56,835
Remember what you said
at Mr. Mathur's office.

2250
02:29:57,064 --> 02:29:58,475
"Until the problem
doesn't get personal..."

2251
02:29:58,499 --> 02:30:00,376
"...no lane's willing to fight,
find a solution."

2252
02:30:00,501 --> 02:30:02,105
You were absolutely right, brother.

2253
02:30:03,804 --> 02:30:05,306
What's wrong now, Keshav.

2254
02:30:05,372 --> 02:30:07,682
We found a solution
and did the impossible.

2255
02:30:07,875 --> 02:30:09,479
We got the toilet.

2256
02:30:10,411 --> 02:30:14,325
Jaya, I promised to give
you your personal toilet.

2257
02:30:14,648 --> 02:30:15,888
I couldn't do it.

2258
02:30:16,117 --> 02:30:18,154
Maybe not personal,
but at least there's a toilet.

2259
02:30:18,318 --> 02:30:21,390
lam happy.
- I couldn't change father's view either.

2260
02:30:22,456 --> 02:30:24,663
I can't take you hack in that house.

2261
02:30:25,092 --> 02:30:26,435
Keshav!

2262
02:30:27,394 --> 02:30:29,601
You'll always be a numbskull.

2263
02:30:30,130 --> 02:30:31,632
You fought against the entire world...

2264
02:30:31,866 --> 02:30:35,109
...and now you say
you won't take her home.

2265
02:30:37,971 --> 02:30:40,713
Daughter-in-law, let this he.

2266
02:30:41,008 --> 02:30:44,820
The fake charades,
fake thumb, fake pride.

2267
02:30:44,945 --> 02:30:48,620
Leave all this behind
and then step inside the house.

2268
02:30:48,983 --> 02:30:50,621
Is he sick?
- I think so.

2269
02:30:50,751 --> 02:30:52,094
I am not sick, son.

2270
02:30:52,286 --> 02:30:54,129
In fact, I am better now.

2271
02:30:55,022 --> 02:30:56,228
You see...

2272
02:30:57,257 --> 02:30:59,999
It's time to take
the blind off our eyes...

2273
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:02,536
...and put it on the toilet.

2274
02:31:03,497 --> 02:31:06,068
That's wonderful, father.

2275
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:09,347
That's wonderful.
- Sorry, daughter-in-law. Sorry.

2276
02:31:09,603 --> 02:31:12,641
For the first time,
I've done something good.

2277
02:31:12,806 --> 02:31:16,481
So only daughter-in-law
will inaugurate my toilet.

2278
02:31:16,543 --> 02:31:17,886
My toilet, father?
- Yes.

2279
02:31:18,079 --> 02:31:19,820
But brother sold his
hike to pay for this..

2280
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:22,053
"You didn't spend a penny.
- Get lost... shut up.

2281
02:31:22,082 --> 02:31:23,993
Just a thought, father.
- Let it he.

2282
02:31:24,218 --> 02:31:25,526
This isn't right.
- Quiet.

2283
02:31:25,586 --> 02:31:28,066
No.. No.. Come on.

2284
02:31:32,826 --> 02:31:34,134
What happened?
- Sister-in-law, look here.

2285
02:31:34,194 --> 02:31:36,640
Brother Keshav...
Group photo. Yes. Yes.

2286
02:31:36,864 --> 02:31:37,842
Ready.

2287
02:32:15,035 --> 02:32:17,106
Written in scriptures.

2288
02:32:17,537 --> 02:32:23,112
Humans should not perform daily action
in front of the sun or moon

2289
02:32:23,277 --> 02:32:26,417
Then the use of the toilet
should he made mandatory.

2290
02:32:26,781 --> 02:32:28,556
I had already told Keshav.

2291
02:32:28,615 --> 02:32:31,562
This sacrifice has to he done in the
interest of cleanliness of the people.

2292
02:32:31,585 --> 02:32:35,795
Children get used to going
to the toilet since childhood.

2293
02:32:35,989 --> 02:32:37,798
If you defecation in the open,
you will heat.

2294
02:32:37,892 --> 02:32:41,237
Getting big pleasure.
My life has changed.

2295
02:32:41,262 --> 02:32:43,173
Father did not approve of this.

2296
02:32:43,197 --> 02:32:45,575
But said no.
Toilets will he definitely made.

2297
02:32:45,633 --> 02:32:46,737
Why do sister-in-law go out to toilet

2298
02:32:46,767 --> 02:32:49,304
Or why should any woman go out?
This is wrong.

2299
02:32:49,336 --> 02:32:51,179
Congratulations to Keshav and Jaya.

2300
02:32:51,271 --> 02:32:53,945
Now the women of the house
do not have to go away in the open.

2301
02:32:54,008 --> 02:32:57,820
Keshav is right. 'If you want
your wife, you got to have a toilet.'

2302
02:32:57,845 --> 02:33:01,554
The money that the government
gave us to make toilets...

2303
02:33:01,582 --> 02:33:02,959
...we returned them.

2304
02:33:03,117 --> 02:33:06,690
Do we take money from
the government to buy TVs and freeze?

2305
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:08,358
Then why take money to make toilet

2306
02:33:08,422 --> 02:33:10,902
The toilets will he made by
our own money

2307
02:33:11,091 --> 02:33:12,195
Remember...

2308
02:33:12,226 --> 02:33:15,639
'If you want your wife,
you got to have a toilet.'
