1
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,532
You should be practicing.

2
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,700
I am practicing.

3
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,285
What you're doing you won't need these.

4
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,453
What's your problem?

5
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,390
What do you learn here?

6
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,352
No Weakness! No Pain! No Mercy!

7
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,231
What do you learn here?

8
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:30,359
No Weakness! No Pain! No Mercy!

9
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,278
Begin!

10
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,220
He's had enough.

11
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,889
Don't you remember what we learned?

12
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,808
No weakness! No pain!

13
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,727
No mercy!

14
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,229
Cheng, stop!

15
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,873
Go home.

16
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,114
What are you doing?

17
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,824
Why did you stop?

18
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,326
Finish!

19
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,041
Come here!

20
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,404
We do not stop when our enemy is down.

21
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,489
No mercy...

22
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,743
No mercy in the studio...

23
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,119
No mercy in competition...

24
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,996
No mercy in life!

25
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,501
Our enemies deserve pain.

26
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,050
What are you looking at?

27
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,677
He's the one that attacked me.

28
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,527
We are here to make peace.

29
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,031
Let your little thing mind himself.

30
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,035
One to one, no problem...

31
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,705
...six to one, too much to ask of anyone.

32
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,707
I see...

33
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,210
Prepare for match.

34
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,388
We are not here to fight.

35
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:30,355
You attack my students
and disrespect my studio?!

36
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,399
You want to leave? Not so easy!

37
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,569
Master Li...

38
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,910
You both came here.

39
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,747
One of you fights now.

40
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,296
The boy will fight there.

41
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,772
We accept your challenge.

42
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:18,024
Please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train.

43
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,156
Attention!

44
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,995
From now on, this little thing
is to be left alone...

45
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,539
...until the tournament.

46
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,874
Understood?

47
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,468
If he does not show up for the competition...

48
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:46,636
...I will bring pain to him and to you.

49
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:54,528
Sir...

50
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:56,822
...my name is Dre Parker.

51
01:48:57,948 --> 01:48:59,950
My actions have brought...

52
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:04,287
...dishonor to your family.

53
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:09,622
Your daughter
has been a great friend to me.

54
01:49:10,836 --> 01:49:13,296
And from her, I have learned...

55
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:15,632
...that a true friend...

56
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:19,135
...is a person who makes your life better.

57
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:23,891
But, if you give me a second chance...

58
01:49:25,142 --> 01:49:28,979
...I promise that I will be...

59
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:34,313
...the best friend your daughter has ever had.

60
01:50:51,228 --> 01:50:53,605
Let the tournament begin!

61
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:19,139
Dre Parker advances to the semi-finals!

62
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:43,746
And now the first semi-final of the evening...

63
01:58:59,591 --> 01:58:59,674
Next semi-final
introducing Fighting Dragon, Liang...

64
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:03,010
Next semi-final
introducing Fighting Dragon, Liang...

65
01:59:05,889 --> 01:59:08,141
...and the surprise finalist, Dre Parker.

66
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:22,989
But, I can beat him.

67
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:24,783
I do not want him beaten.

68
01:59:24,866 --> 01:59:25,950
I want him broken.

69
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:45,238
You're disqualified!

70
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:20,481
He's done.

71
02:01:21,858 --> 02:01:23,442
I'm sorry, you should not continue.

72
02:01:24,068 --> 02:01:26,820
You've brought honor to your family.

73
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:52,388
Dre Parker has 2 minutes
to return to the match.

74
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:54,724
If he is unable to return...

75
02:01:54,808 --> 02:01:59,308
...the Fighting Dragons win by default.

76
02:03:57,263 --> 02:04:01,763
Since Dre Parker has not
returned to the ring...

77
02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:25,123
Dre Parker will fight!

78
02:08:30,203 --> 02:08:31,579
I want you...

79
02:08:32,663 --> 02:08:35,207
...to break his leg.

80
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:38,752
No mercy.

81
02:09:53,494 --> 02:09:56,997
The score is tied, the next point wins!

82
02:10:04,213 --> 02:10:06,798
Can you continue?

83
02:12:02,665 --> 02:12:03,916
Finish him!
