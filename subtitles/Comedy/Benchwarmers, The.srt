1
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,946
- Throw it here.
- Come on, Nelson, throw it in here!

2
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,783
- Yeah! You almost had it!
- I get one more?

3
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,583
Strike three!

4
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,002
- Here you go. There it is.
- Gretchen, you almost had it.

5
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,113
- Dang it.
- Nice throw.

6
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,917
I got a ladder. I'll get it.

7
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,152
Just tell Mrs. Donnelly it's on the roof.
She can get it whenever she wants.

8
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,556
That's good thinking, Clark.

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,961
I'll just have 80-year-old
Mrs. Donnelly climb on her roof.

10
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,465
Okay, cool. Thanks.

11
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,698
Clark. Hey.

12
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,839
I was kidding. You can't do that.

13
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,235
All right, fine.

14
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,501
Here, give her one of these.

15
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,878
- This is yesterday's paper.
- Well, at least it's not on the roof.

16
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,550
Clark, don't pick your nose
in front of me, please.

17
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,719
I'm not picking, I'm scratching.

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,353
What are you scratching,
your brain?

19
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,682
Yeah, because it's huge.

20
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,822
Chain break! Not now!
I have 86 houses left.

21
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,622
Can you fix it?

22
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,896
- Gus, what should I do with this?
- I'd flick it.

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,576
Nelson leans in and gets his sign.

24
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,870
Here comes a fastball.

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,138
Swing and a huge miss
by Gretchen Peterson.

26
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:35,252
Hey, losers. We have a practice
scheduled here. You gotta go.

27
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,616
- I thought your practice was at 4:30.
- It is.

28
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,917
We wanna have a practice
before our practice.

29
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,562
- Oh, okay. Can we hit with you?
- No, you suck.

30
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,057
Why don't you go home
and build your science projects.

31
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,470
Look, there's room for all of us.
We'll just play catch off to the side.

32
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,072
Listen, we have a game tomorrow...

33
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,266
...and there's only one field
to practice on.

34
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,069
So beat it!

35
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,446
Maybe this is a sign
you should get a car.

36
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,676
My mother said I should hold off
getting my license one more year.

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,084
You know, just to make sure
my reflexes are fully developed.

38
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,280
- Stop!
- Hold him, Kyle!

39
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,120
Troy, I think he wants
some of your famous beef stew.

40
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,590
- Beef stew! Beef stew!
- Stop!

41
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,893
Beef stew! Beef stew! Beef stew!

42
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,623
No, no, no.

43
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,767
No, stop it.

44
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,609
Hey! Get off him!

45
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,301
Later, fart face.

46
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,241
Yeah, you better run!

47
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,312
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

48
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,458
Need us to call your parents
or something?

49
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,620
It actually...

50
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,797
...didn't taste as bad as you'd think.

51
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,132
Nelson, wait!
Let's just go to my house!

52
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,806
Oh, I love beef stew.

53
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,874
Why do kids have to be
so fricking cruel?

54
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,644
You know, I haven't been on
an actual field in almost 20 years.

55
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,287
I've never even been on a field.

56
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,518
If I tried, the kids in my neighborhood
would spit loogies on my forehead.

57
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,354
That's awful, Clark.

58
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,496
Baseball is America's pastime.

59
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,822
That's like saying
you've never had apple pie.

60
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,000
You've never had apple pie?

61
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,637
Well, my mom said
it would give me diarrhea.

62
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,501
That's ridiculous.
You have to try it at least once.

63
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,499
Diarrhea?

64
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,474
No. Baseball. It's the best.

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,910
Let's come back here later
and hit some balls.

66
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,341
Can I bring Richie?
He's never played either.

67
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,715
- Yeah, bring Richie. Let's say 4:00.
- All right.

68
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,421
Hold on. My mom's sending me
a text message.

69
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,021
No way!

70
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,562
We're having macaroni tonight!
That means garlic bread! Yes!

71
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,131
Awesome!

72
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,829
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

73
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,665
I rented this
on your recommendation.

74
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,605
It's nothing but a lame story
with lesbian sex scenes.

75
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,244
And you didn't like it?

76
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,778
I watched it with my parents.
It was uncomfortable.

77
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,416
- Come on, it's kind of hot.
- No, it's not.

78
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,245
All right, I'm sorry.

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,411
I'll recommend this:
Haunted Slumber Party,

80
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,854
- It's actually a pretty decent film.
- No lesbian sex scenes?

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,654
- I think there's two.
- You're a pig.

82
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:35,194
- Hey, Richie, are you off yet?
- Easy. I can't leave this second, Clark.

83
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,234
I don't get to work for an hour a day
like you, paperboy.

84
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,372
Gus wants us to
hit some baseballs with him.

85
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,434
Clark, we don't play baseball.

86
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,873
I told Gus we'd be there, Richie.

87
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,377
And if we don't go,
that makes me a liar.

88
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,312
And that's not what I'm about.
Not now, not ever.

89
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,684
All right, Daytime Emmy.

90
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,048
Hey, Marty, I'm gonna split early,
all right?

91
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,724
I don't even know who you are.

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,625
Bros before ho's, dude.

93
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,062
Liz, honey, do you know
where I packed my baseball mitt?

94
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:13,602
No. Gus, if we conceive this month,
we would have the baby in January.

95
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,637
It would be fun to have
a New Year's baby.

96
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,207
I can't find it.

97
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,436
January also has a higher
percentage of it being a girl.

98
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,280
I found it. I found it.

99
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,850
I found my mitt, Liz.
It was in the old trunk.

100
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,614
Be serious. This is important.
My ovulation peaks at 6:00 tonight.

101
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,087
All right, honey, I love you.
I'll see you later.

102
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,192
Remember, Gus, 6:00.

103
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,831
Gotta keep your eye on the ball.

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,793
You just think of that?
You're an amazing coach.

105
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,436
Just focus, you'll be fine.
Just watch me.

106
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,734
With this vest, it's hard to swing.
It's tight, you know.

107
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,379
Quit picking your nose, Clark.
Let's go. Look alive. Coming to you!

108
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,022
You just lost your membership
at Video Spot!

109
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,654
Dang it.

110
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,988
Hey, mister,
we have this field reserved.

111
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,495
You were the ones
picking on that kid today.

112
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,224
So? You douche bags
have to get off this field.

113
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,336
- Where's your coach?
- None of your business.

114
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,467
We have practice here,
so go, ho!

115
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,035
Hey, well, no coach, no field. Sorry.

116
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,677
Leave our field,
or you'll pay the consequences!

117
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,603
What is this, Children of the Corn?

118
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,743
I'm gonna call the cops.

119
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,578
We are cops. We're Navy SEALs.

120
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,186
- Navy SEALs aren't cops.
- Arert you our paperboy?

121
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,789
I'm undercover.

122
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,688
All right, you cocky jerks, you want
the field so bad? We'll play you for it.

123
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,864
But there are nine of us
and three of you.

124
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,589
So you should beat us no problem.

125
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,563
- What, are you scared?
- No.

126
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,430
Yeah, chicken.

127
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,662
I'm gonna go ask our team.

128
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,568
This is a bad idea. They look tough.

129
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,572
I saw that demon boy laying beef
in some nice kid's mouth earlier today.

130
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,011
Clark used to get beef
laid in his face all the time.

131
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,948
- Oh, and you didn't?
- I got wedgies, that's different.

132
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,019
It's cooler.

133
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,783
- We'll do it.
- Time to meet your makers.

134
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,358
Makers of what? Poop?

135
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,425
Coming down!

136
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,661
- Balls in.
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.

137
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,532
- Get your position down.
- Troy, strike this loser out.

138
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,238
- Strike!
- Yeah. Nice one, Troy.

139
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,277
Don't swing if it's not
in the strike zone.

140
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,779
- Where's the strike zone?
- Strike two!

141
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:38,951
Right there.

142
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,388
- Strike three.
- Three, you're out!

143
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,559
- What a loser.
- Sit down, spaz.

144
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,491
- That kid's throwing heat.
- Heat, schmeat.

145
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,096
One out!

146
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,766
Gonna be two outs!

147
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,494
Hey, I bet you're a real good catcher.
Of doughnuts, in your mouth.

148
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,673
- Strike!
- Don't chop at it.

149
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,775
- It's not a sword.
- You're not a sword.

150
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,442
- Come on.
- Strike two.

151
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,411
- Oh, that's ugly, man.
- Strike out, video boy.

152
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,708
Come on, now.

153
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,649
- Strike three!
- I caught it. You're out.

154
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,652
- But I ticked it. It hit the bat.
- You're still out.

155
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,693
You're still fat. I ticked it!

156
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,922
- I ticked it. Gus, you see that?
- Way to make contact on that one.

157
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,660
You know what? I was trying
to get under it to rip it into left...

158
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,532
...and throw them off,
but the dog barking threw me.

159
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,639
- What dog?
- He ran to the bushes.

160
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:39,140
It's cool now. All right, go, Gus.
Come on! Let's get rid of these dogs.

161
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,108
- Strike him out quick!
- Get this guy out!

162
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,374
- Move in.
- You're going down, shorty.

163
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,882
- Guy's got nothing.
- Come on, give him a fast one.

164
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,458
All right, Gus! Awesome!

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,058
All right! Yeah!

166
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,660
- He just did that steroid-free.
- What's steroids?

167
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,302
Something that makes
your pee-pee smaller.

168
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,406
- There must be steroids in macaroni.
- Let's go.

169
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,672
Yeah!

170
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,170
Nice!

171
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,679
- Here we go.
- Batter up.

172
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,048
Batter up!

173
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,197
Strike!

174
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,364
Not so fast!

175
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,060
You're supposed to catch it
with your glove, not your face.

176
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,533
Yeah!

177
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,833
I don't need lip from you,
son of Satan.

178
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,068
- We're still in this thing.
- It's okay. Next time.

179
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,279
You're out!

180
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,583
You're out!

181
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,677
Strike three, you're out!

182
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,083
- Come on, Troy. Let's go, Troy.
- He can't hit you. Come on.

183
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,126
- Yes!
- Yeah, Gus! Are you okay?

184
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,965
It's over!

185
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,703
Three, you're out!

186
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,507
Sorry. Shoot.
Get another homer for us, Gus.

187
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,973
- Yeah, smack it in the butt.
- Whatever that means.

188
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,911
I'm gonna keep this one in play.
Give the infield a workout. It's 17-0.

189
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,244
What an idiot.
Come on, Troy, destroy him!

190
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,315
Strike him out. Strike this loser...

191
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,957
Come on, Kyle, are you okay?

192
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,286
- What happened?
- Get up.

193
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,052
- Hey, get him up.
- Kyle, you okay?

194
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:42,058
- Ball's still alive, chumps.
- Dude, he's gonna score.

195
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,069
Should somebody call 411?

196
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,330
He's fine.
He got the wind knocked out of him.

197
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,265
What's that noise?

198
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,843
- Get him! Get him!
- Get him!

199
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,415
I think he just got the wind
knocked back into him.

200
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,786
Gus, why didn't you play in
high school? You're incredible.

201
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,019
The whole bully thing, and jocks.
I didn't wanna deal with it.

202
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,926
Those butts! You could've gone
to the Super Bowl.

203
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,725
Yeah, that's the past.

204
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,632
- Hey, Richie, where's your brother?
- Howie! Come out, the guys are here.

205
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,466
Is he still dealing with agoraphobia?

206
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,165
Yeah, dude, he hasn't left the house
in six months.

207
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,674
There he is.

208
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,109
- Hey, Howie.
- How's it going, buddy?

209
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,647
Hey, guys.
How did hitting the balls go?

210
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:35,787
We played an actual game
against real people. It was classic.

211
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,422
All these punk teenagers are like,
"Get off our field."

212
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,718
We're like, "We'll play you for it."
And we did, and we beat them.

213
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,987
- I hit a foul, dude, it was sweet.
- It was awesome.

214
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,495
You gotta videotape it next time
so I can see.

215
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,362
- Buddy, just come with us.
- No. No.

216
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,663
It's not that scary. And you could use
a little sun, trust me.

217
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,467
Outside, bad. The sun, scary.

218
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,076
He's not my friend.
He wants to hurt me. Safe room.

219
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,548
- I know. Sun, bad. You, cuckoo.
- All right.

220
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,411
You know the best part about
winning a baseball game?

221
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,917
- What's that?
- Going to Pizza Hut to celebrate.

222
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,784
Richie?

223
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,323
Oh, yeah. Okay, buddy.

224
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,655
- Is that apple juice?
- No.

225
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,366
Honestly, you have
real natural athletic skills.

226
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,298
You could be a terrific ball player.

227
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,472
When you throw it to me,
and I catch it...

228
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,574
Not with my face, but with a glove.
- I like it.

229
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,835
I am starting to get the fever.

230
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,244
Dude, this chick is so hot.

231
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,847
What's going on?

232
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,021
Nothing. Just refilling the bar.

233
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,053
I love salad.

234
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,657
Yeah, it's...

235
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,191
...good and good for you.

236
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,256
I love salad.

237
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,363
That was some Barry White shit.
Very smooth.

238
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,336
Yeah, I work it when I have to.

239
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,671
- How's "Ms. Pac-Man" treating you?
- That red ghost is kicking my balls.

240
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,473
Yeah, that's them, Uncle Jerry.

241
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,444
Richie Goodman and Clark Reedy?

242
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,984
What were you losers doing
on my ball field today?

243
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,053
- Clark was. I was home.
- They were with me.

244
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,954
We were just hitting balls. These kids
showed up and we scrimmaged them.

245
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,924
That is priceless.

246
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,587
Clork the Dork and Richie Bitchy
playing baseball.

247
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,997
- Why is that so funny?
- Because they're retards.

248
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,639
They should stick to what they know:
Boogers and dingleberries.

249
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,034
You, stay away from my field...

250
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,576
...or I'll have my 12-year-old nephew
kick your ass.

251
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,339
Nice meeting you, Fairy Jerry.

252
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,287
- What was that?
- You gave them nicknames.

253
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,184
I thought I'd give you one.
Fairy Jerry.

254
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,492
- Oh, really?
- Really.

255
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,355
Okay, Gus.

256
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,624
Gus...

257
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,426
- Gus Bus.
- What?

258
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,200
That's you. Gus Bus.

259
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,172
Wow, that was a brutal comeback.

260
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,303
Let's go, guys. I don't think
I'll ever recover from that.

261
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,738
Man.

262
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,611
You stay off my field.

263
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,776
Stay away from the fairy dust, Jerry.

264
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,484
- "Gus Bus"?
- Shut up, Troy.

265
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,017
It was the coolest, Gus.

266
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,282
Never seen anybody stand up
to Jerry like that.

267
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,791
I knew guys like that where I grew up.
They think they can do whatever.

268
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,292
I just wanted to say...

269
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,830
...that was great, the way
you put Jerry McDowell in his place.

270
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,228
That was no big deal.

271
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,232
Well, unfortunately for all of us...

272
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,133
...Jerry's in charge of
the baseball league for the county.

273
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,832
Hey. Are you the kid
that got farted on earlier?

274
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,137
Yes. This is my son Nelson.

275
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,076
He's become the fart magnet
for the neighborhood bullies.

276
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,911
I also get a healthy smear
of animal turds twice daily.

277
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,555
When I was your age, Fairy Jerry
dumped a bucket of dog poop on me.

278
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,224
His son just did that to me
last week.

279
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,554
I tried to talk to Jerry. He just laughed
and gave me a titty twister.

280
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,390
Guys like that don't realize
the damage they're causing.

281
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,429
I couldn't agree more.

282
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,740
By the way, thanks for hitting
Kyle Wilson in the chest with the ball...

283
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,414
...then letting me rip one
right in his mouth earlier.

284
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,742
It was one of the best days
of my life.

285
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,382
This car is so radical.

286
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,579
Looks just like K.I.T.T.
From the show Knight Rider.

287
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,280
It is K.I.T.T. From Knight Rider,

288
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,694
Watch this.

289
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,591
Allow me to introduce myself,
I'm K, I, T, T,

290
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,294
Who are you?

291
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,302
I'm just one of those nerds
who grew up...

292
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,337
...to make billions.

293
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,939
Maybe I'll see you guys
around sometime.

294
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,044
It was a pleasure to meet you all,

295
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,379
Easy, Mel,

296
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,381
I have yet to perfect the peel-out.

297
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,583
- It was fine.
- No, no, no. That was cool.

298
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,489
- Yeah.
- Chicks were checking you out.

299
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,789
Try not to destroy me
completely, Mel,

300
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,903
Hey, honey, I'm home.

301
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,476
- Where have you been?
- I was with Clark and Richie.

302
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,076
I am on an ovulating schedule.
You were supposed to be here at 6:00.

303
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,516
I thought you meant
Central Mountain Time.

304
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,413
Did you mean
Pacific Standard Time?

305
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,748
- Why would you think that?
- Because you're from Colorado.

306
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,356
Don't you ovulate
according to where you're born?

307
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,753
Gus, that's just weird.

308
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,452
So from now on,
it's Pacific Standard Time.

309
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,462
Pacific Standard Time.
I'm all over that, baby. I love you.

310
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,572
Check out this mitt. It's all black.

311
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,038
I look like a Borack warrior
from the Captain Mighty series.

312
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,072
Well, get a load of Mega Mitt.

313
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,781
Hey! Hey! What the...?

314
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,645
Watch it!

315
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,988
Clark? Richie?

316
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,991
I hardly recognize you clowns
without underwear on your head.

317
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,791
Brad. You have really
not slimmed down.

318
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,364
Oh, eat me.

319
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,435
So I heard from Jerry you tools
think you're athletes now.

320
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,469
I didn't know "athlete"
had three syllables. "a-tha-lete."

321
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,904
That's "ama-za-zing."

322
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,170
You think you're hot shit
because you know words.

323
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,939
Why don't you be a stud
and point us toward the register.

324
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,016
Or "register-er."

325
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:45,020
My team practices today at 5.
Swing by if you she-men wanna lose.

326
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,189
You can't handle the truth!

327
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,020
- Bring it!
- Suck it!

328
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,863
Gus!

329
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,769
Gus!

330
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,765
He can't hear us.

331
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,009
Hey, fellas.

332
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:17,021
- You okay, Richie?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just purple nuts.

333
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,851
We just had a run-in with one of our
old bullies at the sporting goods store.

334
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,856
- What happened?
- He said we're wussies...

335
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,960
...and he challenged us to a game.

336
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,598
- I don't know if you can leave work.
- Of course I can.

337
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,960
I'll mow this later.
Let's take this guy down.

338
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,194
I think I'm gonna puke.
Grab my arm.

339
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,263
Bobby, this one's coming for you.
Focus and give us a double play now.

340
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,966
Let's go!

341
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,810
Thattaway. Good job.

342
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,984
Looks like the Three Muske-queers
decided to show up.

343
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,643
Everybody, get your butts in here.
Time for us to scrimmage some losers.

344
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,517
Yeah, we got a "scrim-im-age."
Come on!

345
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,317
How the hell will this work
with three guys?

346
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,359
We got a pitcher, a catcher,
and a fielder.

347
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,931
No, you've got a retarded paperboy,
a gay video clerk...

348
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,761
...and a smelly midget.

349
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,800
You wanna dance?
I'll dance on your face.

350
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,995
Dance? We'll beat your ass.

351
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,232
- Death to you.
- Titty twister!

352
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,039
My wife's the only one
who gets to twist these man-titties.

353
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,510
I just know you guys better...
Better come ready to play!

354
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,582
Gus is the new Jet Li.

355
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,917
Bring it on!

356
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,252
Hey, Dad, come down
to the field, quick!

357
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,396
Strike one!

358
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,131
Strike two!

359
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,232
Strike three!

360
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,869
- Hey!
- What? It slipped.

361
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,831
Strike three!

362
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,203
Hey! What are you laughing at?

363
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,876
He told me a joke.

364
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,307
- Let's go, Richie!
- Oh, yeah.

365
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,748
Hey, Dad, come here. Look.

366
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,782
Might wanna throw a fielder
up in those mountains, in case:

367
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,325
- What you got?
- Strike!

368
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,052
Pulled something. Used to run track.

369
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,629
Come on, Richie.

370
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,527
- Strike two!
- I didn't swing at that. Can't count it.

371
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,331
Strike three!

372
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,799
Could you tell him to slow it down?

373
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,504
Did you tell him?

374
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,378
- Here you go, Clark.
- Thanks, Nelson.

375
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,848
You're welcome.

376
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,525
Home run!

377
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,326
Yeah! Yeah, did you see that?

378
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,795
All right! You hit another homer!

379
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,332
Howie! He just hit a home run!

380
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,938
Strike one! Strike two! Strike three!

381
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,777
Can I get you a tennis racket?

382
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,648
No!

383
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,387
Bravo, gentlemen. Bravo.

384
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,589
- Great game.
- Hey, thanks, Mel.

385
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,293
Say, guys, I have this sensational idea
I wanna run by you.

386
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,028
Are you free for lunch tomorrow?

387
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:26,472
I usually take lunch from 12 to 4:30,
so if it's in there I could handle it.

388
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,669
Tomorrow is egg salad day...

389
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,905
...but I guess I could
double up on lunch.

390
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,242
Gus, what do you think?

391
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,078
- One sounds good.
- Great.

392
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,720
I'm at 501 Shmegmer Street.

393
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,515
- See you then.
- See you, Nelson.

394
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,421
- Bye. Bye, guys.
- What do you think it's about?

395
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,595
- Dude, you're in trouble.
- No way.

396
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,559
You're definitely busted.

397
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,960
I didn't do anything. I swear!

398
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,572
- This is it?
- I always wondered who lived here.

399
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,972
I just thought it was Clay Aiken
or something.

400
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,807
- Who goes there?
- That is so cool!

401
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,210
It's Gus, Clark and Richie.
We're here to see Mel.

402
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,544
- You may enter,
- Thanks, Darth.

403
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,812
"Thanks, Darth."

404
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:14,516
- This place is sick, yo.
- This house must cost a zillion dollars.

405
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,717
Two zillion, actually.

406
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,089
Hey, Mel. This place is incredible.

407
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,528
Thank you, Gus. Gentlemen,
welcome to Chateau Shmegmer.

408
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,259
Shall we adjourn
to the food quarters?

409
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,471
Gentlemen, make yourselves
at home.

410
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,939
Yoda! R2!

411
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,407
Number 7!

412
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,276
Lunch is ready when you are,
Mr, Carmichael,

413
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,388
- Hey, Number 7.
- Don't touch me!

414
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,717
Gentlemen, let's eat.
Sit wherever you please.

415
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,554
Gentlemen, order any kind
of sandwich you'd like.

416
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,357
Number 7, thank you.

417
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:59,594
I'll have a peanut-butter-and-jelly
sandwich with mayonnaise.

418
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,279
Can I have tuna fish and Skittles...

419
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,814
...and pudding skin on wheat,
with the crust cut off?

420
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,542
I guess so,

421
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,918
That was radical!

422
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,687
All right, I got a crazy one for you,
Number 7.

423
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,524
I'd like a turkey on white...

424
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,330
He's good.

425
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,533
So, what's on your mind, Mel?

426
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:35,433
Gentlemen, it is time we brought
this cause into the public eye.

427
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,235
- What cause?
- The cause of the benchwarmers...

428
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:43,210
...the kids who warm the bench while
the others get to play and have fun.

429
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:48,011
All of us here in this room have been
excluded from athletic activities...

430
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,314
...and now our kids are going through
the same tomfoolery.

431
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,788
- Now, Richie, do you have any kids?
- Never had a date.

432
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,158
- Clark?
- Never spoke to a girl.

433
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,797
- Gus?
- My wife and I are working on it.

434
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,497
Well, when you do have them...

435
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,903
...you will know how painful it is
to see them sad.

436
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,467
- Bonjour, dudes.
- Hey, Nelson.

437
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,475
- How's it going?
- There's my man.

438
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,480
Son, you have a little smear
of something on your cheek.

439
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,981
From a dog or a cat?

440
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,556
I think it's a goat.

441
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,120
Number 7,
some assistance, please.

442
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,135
Thanks, Number 7.
You're my best friend.

443
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,167
As you are mine, Nelson,

444
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,597
That's so cool.

445
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,406
Now, this is why I wanna start
a round-robin tournament...

446
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:53,573
...with you incredible men against all
the notoriously mean-spirited teams.

447
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,447
But why us three?

448
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,386
Because you know what it feels like
to be left out.

449
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,082
You're three grown men
who never got to play baseball...

450
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,661
...because you were weird
and smelled and sat when you peed.

451
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,596
Okay, the last one was just me.
But you get my point.

452
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,965
But why would any of these teams
agree to play in this tournament?

453
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,541
For the prize.

454
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,047
- That's incredible!
- Killer!

455
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,484
An official-size stadium,
modeled to scale...

456
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,625
...after all the greatest ballparks
in America.

457
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,555
Like Wrigley, Fenway
and Yankee Stadium.

458
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,162
Nelson and his buddies have set up
websites devoted to your team.

459
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,801
You can go on Nerdly. Net,
TheBenchwarmers. Org...

460
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,233
...or Please-stop-with-the-shit-tossing-
it's-getting-old. Com.

461
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,499
Why don't you just build a stadium
for Nelson and his buddies...

462
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,371
...and keep everybody else out?
- That won't solve anything.

463
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,375
Yeah, Clark.

464
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,377
If we can beat them
at their own game...

465
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,210
...then kids like Nelson
and his buddies will get respect.

466
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,545
We'll do it. Come on.

467
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,850
Benchwarmers on three.
One, two, three.

468
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,219
Benchwarmers!

469
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,258
Can I get a napkin?
I spilled my ice cream.

470
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,725
On the counter.

471
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,896
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Gus Matthews?

472
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:22,130
Sorry. I spit a lot when I speak.
People despise me for it.

473
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:27,744
People spit. I mean, I spit
when I talk sometimes, too, you know?

474
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,414
My name is Sammy.
They call me Sammy Sprinkler.

475
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,551
Pleased to meet you, Sammy.
I'm Gus. Gus Bus.

476
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,277
Hey, if I come to a game...

477
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,456
...can I be your scorekeeper
and statistician?

478
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,919
- Certainly.
- Yes!

479
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:44,753
- All right. See you later, Sammy.
- You're the man, Gus. Peace out.

480
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,328
All right.

481
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,756
Who was that boy?

482
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,630
I'm just seeing if he might be
interested in babysitting our triplets.

483
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,931
- Why are you spitting on me?
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

484
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,709
This is idiotic.

485
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,436
Are these guys serious about
this benchwarmer crap?

486
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,878
- It sounds like it.
- I'm not playing in this stinking thing.

487
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,542
If there werert nerds in the world,
who would we throw crap at?

488
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,053
No doubt. But what if we don't play,
and they win it?

489
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,658
They'll probably build
some weird nerd spaceship...

490
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,387
...and fly it to Planet Booger
or something, I don't know.

491
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,767
Now, guys,
it's one-game elimination.

492
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,765
They're as good as done.

493
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,232
You know what? You're right.

494
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:31,637
Let's strap it on, and beat these three
geeks, and win us a new stadium.

495
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,276
Let's get it on!

496
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,278
This green one is sweet.
Oh, all right. Okay.

497
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,914
We have a crowd, you guys.

498
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,954
Excellent!

499
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,124
- Crap! What is she doing here?
- Who is it?

500
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,783
- It's that salad chick from Pizza Hut.
- She's so hot, it's sick.

501
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,792
- Hey, she's with me.
- You wish.

502
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,096
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How you feeling?

503
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,736
I just destroyed that Porta-Potty,
but I'm feeling better.

504
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,494
Who did this?

505
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,803
Sorry!

506
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,840
Listen, I got a gift for you.

507
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,606
I never had my own uniform before.

508
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,783
We can't have a team
without uniforms.

509
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:16,010
I'm never taking this off.
This is the coolest thing ever.

510
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,156
This is the first game of
the tournament. Let's go out styling.

511
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,023
Nelson, you showed some serious
bat-retrieving skills last game.

512
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,459
What do you say about being
the Benchwarmers' official batboy?

513
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,731
- That means yes!
- All right!

514
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:34,203
Come on! What are we waiting for?
Let's kick some hairless ass!

515
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,036
I had hair on my ass
before I could walk.

516
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,340
This is it, kids.

517
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,538
The Benchwarmers' quest
for a stadium is about to begin.

518
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,183
- Karl's!
- Karl's Auto Body, the bad guys...

519
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:52,014
,,, have taken the field in our Internet
Podcast of Benchwarmers baseball,

520
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,214
First to bat, Richie Goodman,

521
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,892
Fingers crossed.

522
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,994
- Come on, Richie.
- Easy out here. Let's go.

523
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,425
The pitcher pitches...

524
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,099
Strike!

525
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,033
I ticked it.

526
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,362
I ticked it again.

527
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,842
Strike!

528
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,068
Nice try, son.

529
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,578
- Just fouled two in front of salad girl.
- Nice.

530
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,080
Next up to bat, Clark Reedy.

531
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,286
All right, Clark. Here we go.
You're the man.

532
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,285
Those squirrels are definitely out.

533
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,595
That's my Miata! Kill him!

534
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,105
Hey, break it up!

535
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,071
Why is this happening?

536
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,905
Come on! Snap his femur!

537
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,808
Richie, help me!

538
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,378
Help me!

539
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,108
Mommy!

540
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,642
Come on, Gus.

541
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,482
- We need it.
- You can do it.

542
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,262
- Home run!
- Yeah!

543
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,233
Strike!

544
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,974
Strike!

545
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,123
Another one!

546
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,520
Oh, my God!

547
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,325
Strike!

548
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,694
Strike!

549
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,765
Gus Bus! Gus Bus! Gus Bus!

550
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,103
This can't just be about me.
I gotta get these guys more involved.

551
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,111
- Look alive, Clark!
- I wanna go home.

552
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,874
No, we need you, buddy.

553
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,018
No, you don't. I'm awful.

554
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,781
Come on, now.

555
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,383
Let's go, Tommy!

556
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,218
This one's coming
right to you, Clark.

557
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,122
It's up, Clark! Clark!

558
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,594
Clark, look out!

559
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,032
Attaboy! Good job!

560
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,065
All right! Good throw!

561
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,004
Use your mitt, son, not your head!

562
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,681
Get it in here, pal! Get it in here.

563
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,446
Hold, hold, hold. Good job.

564
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,781
Gus, come on. Let's end this.

565
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,085
Two outs. Strike this kid out,
like before.

566
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,052
A home run here would tie it up...

567
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,199
...and knock the Benchwarmers
out of the tournament.

568
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,330
There we go! Nice! Go! Run!

569
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,698
Make the play, Clark!

570
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,401
Clark, go!

571
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,936
Pick up the ball!

572
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,415
Run! Go, go, go!

573
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,778
Richie! Incoming!

574
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,683
What did you say?

575
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,255
- There we go! Nice! Go!
- Richie, get the ball!

576
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,551
The ball?

577
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,129
Behind you!

578
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,211
You're out!

579
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,678
What are you doing?!

580
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,717
Yes!

581
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,598
I'm sorry, honey,
we had another game today.

582
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,504
I pulled a muscle
sliding into second.

583
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,009
- You gotta be kidding.
- It's all right, I was safe.

584
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,017
Gus, we're trying to start a family.
I can't do it by myself.

585
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,948
I would hope not, because that
would make you a hermaphrodite.

586
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,452
We don't want that.

587
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,124
I'm glad this is a big joke to you.

588
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,691
Honey, I was just having a little fun.

589
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,227
Come on, don't go.

590
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,998
Gentlemen, yesterday's performance
was phenomenal.

591
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:34,570
All the online chat rooms
are exploding with enthusiasm.

592
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,901
Hey, Mel, why aren't we out practicing
on the field?

593
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,169
Well, I thought we could have
kind of a secret practice.

594
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,472
Maybe become more well-rounded
as a unit.

595
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,208
Nothing much.
Hitting, running, throwing, catching.

596
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,683
- Yeah, Clark.
- I heard you stunk,

597
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,186
- Shut up, Number 7.
- You shut up,

598
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,483
I'll kill you.

599
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,785
I want you guys to meet
an old friend of mine...

600
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,825
...who knows a thing or two
about baseball.

601
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,021
Ready when you are, buddy!

602
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,394
- Is that Mr. T?
- Dude, it's Dr. Dre.

603
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,864
No, no.

604
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,970
That's Reggie Jackson.

605
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,172
Yeah, no, I don't know.

606
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,343
Mr. October! Five hundred
and sixty-three home runs.

607
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,977
Twice World Series MVP...

608
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,204
...where he spanked
four consecutive home runs.

609
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,746
Three on three pitches.

610
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,044
Reggie bar and I met at tuba camp
when we were kids.

611
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,587
- Look at that.
- Oh, no way.

612
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,884
- That's you, Reggie?
- Why is that so funny?

613
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,687
- I was a cute kid.
- Oh, absolutely.

614
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,659
You're like a young Denzel.

615
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,696
I didn't know Denzel played Urkel.

616
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,665
Reginator and I went through
some tough times...

617
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,895
...with bullies and being picked on.

618
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,505
I can't stand that stuff.
Drives me crazy!

619
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,100
- Crazy!
- Easy, buddy.

620
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,335
Easy.

621
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,439
Anyway,
I told Reggie-Reggie-Oxen-Free...

622
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,879
...we're having problems
with our fundamentals.

623
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,054
He agreed to come and help us
run some drills. Isn't that great?

624
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,816
We'll do the same drills that I did
when I was a kid learning to play.

625
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:01,692
All right.

626
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,351
All right.

627
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,054
Hey, so whose house is this?

628
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,493
This is to teach you speed.

629
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,666
How is standing here gonna teach us
speed? What are you doing?

630
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,562
- Hey, run!
- Why?

631
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,293
- Go, go!
- Reggie, you're nuts!

632
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,766
Go, go, go!

633
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,669
Who in the hell is it?!
I was freaking sleeping!

634
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,874
Nobody messes with me!

635
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,674
I will rip your throat out!
Do you hear me?!

636
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,613
And I will find you!

637
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,146
You're in the bushes!

638
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,925
I'm sorry!

639
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,553
I'm sorry! Go back to sleep!

640
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,234
- Come on, guys, let's go. Come on.
- Run, run, run.

641
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,178
Who's there?

642
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,409
You better run, you smart alecks!

643
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,384
- Who is it, Brad?
- Just a bunch of punks...

644
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,251
...who better watch their backs!

645
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:11,087
Relax, smarty pants.
Let's finish the massage.

646
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,157
- Brad have a pool?
- I don't think so.

647
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,994
Yeah, I guess you're right.

648
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,830
Oh, you little devil.
I'm gonna get you.

649
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,005
Nightmares.

650
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,441
This next drill, boys, is for your
catch-and-quick-release skills.

651
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,073
Hot potato!

652
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:32,877
No!

653
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,850
Excellent, Clark.

654
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,179
Clark, let it go!

655
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,816
- Throw it! Get rid of it!
- Come on, let it go!

656
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,295
Release! Release! Release!

657
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,872
Sorry,

658
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,132
Oh, dear,

659
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,699
Well,,,,

660
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,846
The final drill is for
hand-eye coordination. Hit it, Mel!

661
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,741
Let's go racing!

662
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,213
- Look at that! Excellent!
- That's insane!

663
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,426
- Yeah, baby!
- You got it, buddy.

664
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,751
That's my friend!

665
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,727
Give me the bat.

666
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,595
Gus Bus! Gus Bus!

667
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,008
Thattaway to go.

668
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,335
Don't fall.

669
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,809
- You got it. You can do it.
- Hit it, baby!

670
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:41,676
Man, you can do it. You can do it.
Let me see it.

671
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,579
Clark, you're lucky I'm a billionaire.

672
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,689
The score is all tied up,

673
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,351
The bottom of the sixth. This is
the Benchwarmers' closest battle yet.

674
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,424
Strike.

675
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,457
All right, Clark.
See the ball, be the ball.

676
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,535
Strike two!

677
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,070
- Clark just made contact.
- With his own head.

678
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,832
Grab real tight and concen...

679
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,075
Hey!

680
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,311
- Better distance that time. Yeah.
- Thanks.

681
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,486
Richie's coming up.
The Benchwarmers need a hit here.

682
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,450
All right, Richie, here we go.

683
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,385
She's way out of your league.

684
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,320
- What's?
- You're probably a 39-year-old virgin.

685
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,722
Women don't think that's too cute.

686
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,859
Shouldrt you be at home,
like, combing your doll's hair?

687
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,931
Shouldrt you be at home
blowing a doll up?

688
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,729
That's the only action a tool like you
is ever gonna get.

689
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,334
Take it out on the ball, not his head.

690
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,450
Run! Run!

691
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,086
Move your ass, Richie!

692
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,984
- Run, Richie, run!
- You got it! Way to run!

693
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,921
Go! Go! Go!

694
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,157
Slide if you have to!

695
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,025
He's rounding third
and heading for home!

696
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,670
Bring it, dork.

697
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,378
Touch home plate!
Touch home plate!

698
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,949
Richie, touch home!

699
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,544
- Safe!
- He scores!

700
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,192
- Benchwarmers win!
- It's a miracle! It's a miracle!

701
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,826
I ain't a virgin now...

702
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,724
...to home runs, beyotch!

703
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,002
The Benchwarmers win a close one
on Richie's first home run,,,

704
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:47,644
,,, in the history of the universe,
We'll see you in game three,

705
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,006
- I never hit it.
- Can we have your autographs?

706
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,044
Are you serious?

707
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,841
- Yeah, you can.
- All right.

708
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,643
Write my name on the ball?

709
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,378
You see that home run?
Tell your sister about it.

710
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,023
Wait, do you need my address too?

711
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:05,821
You guys are making some noise.
This is music to my ear hair.

712
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,692
My dad has ear hair.
It's pretty scary.

713
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,833
Is "badass" one or two words?

714
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,774
- How do they keep winning?!
- These guys are turd nuggets!

715
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,943
- Who wants to wrestle?
- I'm in.

716
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,408
- All right.
- I'm good, I'm good.

717
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,841
Gotcha.

718
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,112
Howie, look,
they're not gonna kill you, all right?

719
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,286
They're dropping off
the cookies I ordered.

720
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,086
They look very aggressive.

721
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,648
- I think they wanna beat me up.
- Trust me, you'll be fine.

722
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,727
Just take the Thin Mints back
into the apartment.

723
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,897
- That's our food for the week.
- Fine.

724
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:44,192
You can eat the Thin Mints
at my funeral, Richie.

725
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,236
Hot. Hot.

726
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,709
Hot sun.

727
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,521
Cookie.

728
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,819
Sun, bad! Sun, bad!

729
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,826
Excuse me?

730
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,263
- Are you okay?
- How you doing? Yeah. Wrong pipe.

731
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:25,067
- No biggie. What's going on?
- Just returning these movies.

732
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,409
Hey, well, I'm the management
so I'm gonna waive the late fee.

733
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,582
Oh, they're not late. But thank you.

734
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:36,776
Well, anything you want
in the store is free too, so...

735
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,751
I'm Sarah,
and this is my brother Jarrett.

736
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,790
He's a huge fan of yours
and the Benchwarmers.

737
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,853
Cool. Thanks for cheering us on.

738
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,621
Hey, what does "beyotch" mean?

739
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,026
That's...

740
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,702
That means "good game"
in Swedlandia.

741
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,598
Well, we'll let you get back to work.

742
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,706
Okay. But maybe I'll see you
at another game, hopefully?

743
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,876
Yeah. Definitely.

744
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,477
- All right. See you, Jarrett.
- Beyotch yesterday.

745
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,784
Marty, what do you think
of my future wife?

746
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,886
I smell cinnamon rolls.

747
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,682
Oh, I smell cinnamon rolls too.

748
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,489
Gentlemen, check it out.

749
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:21,495
Nerd headquarters.
Never felt more comfortable in my life.

750
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:25,795
Hey, guys, take a gander at these.
We made your own baseball cards.

751
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,893
- Give me that.
- Let me see this.

752
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,335
- What?
- They got statistics.

753
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,203
- I hit 30 home runs.
- I got 11 foul ticks.

754
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,346
I have 20 eyes-closed strikeouts, five
broken windshields, six dead birds.

755
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,072
I'm freaking awesome!

756
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,650
Now listen up. Brookdale and Candia
both advanced today.

757
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,117
We have to beat them
to make it to the semifinals.

758
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,950
Unfortunately, it is on
their own home turf.

759
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,149
We'll have to hit the road
for a few days.

760
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,886
- Did you say Brookdale?
- Yeah, aren't you from Brookdale?

761
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,264
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's great.

762
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,525
We'll have a big
welcome-home party for you.

763
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:58,929
No!

764
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,502
I mean, it's all right.

765
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,366
I lost contact with everybody there.

766
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,474
Wait, so we're staying overnight?

767
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,701
Does my mother have to sign
a permission slip?

768
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,776
No, but we will have to change
your diaper.

769
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,009
Seriously, it's been three days.

770
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:17,777
Sweetheart, I have to leave town
for a landscaping convention.

771
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,422
You never mentioned
a landscaping convention before.

772
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,524
I know. This is the first one.

773
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:26,992
My ovulation schedule is delayed
because of the full moon anyway.

774
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,391
So it's okay.

775
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,727
Hey, Gussie,
imagine if we had a boy first...

776
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,530
...and he grew up to be smart
and sweet and handsome.

777
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,071
Or imagine he's only 3 feet tall...

778
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,267
...and everybody in the school calls
him Midget Boy or Yoda.

779
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,878
Then, just for fun,
they throw him into bowling pins...

780
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,572
...and laugh until
they pee all over themselves.

781
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,217
Were you Midget Boy or Yoda?

782
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,882
I don't wanna talk about it.

783
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,489
Just make some room, honey,
I gotta take a leak.

784
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,129
Oh, my God, you're not kidding!
Gus, stop it!

785
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,308
Mel is officially insane.

786
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,976
Oh, my God.

787
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:19,210
Right?

788
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,512
Gus, how sick is this?
It sleeps five and it's got Playstation.

789
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,418
Check out the fridge, it's full of sweets.
I'm already on my third candy bar.

790
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,354
- Oh, man.
- Mother would not approve of this.

791
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,051
That's creepy.

792
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,921
- What the hell is that?
- That's just Howie.

793
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,266
Howie? You left the house.
Good for you.

794
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,801
Richie told me about the killer
in the neighborhood.

795
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:45,373
He's killing anyone named Howie.
That's my name. That's my name.

796
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,975
Just go with it.

797
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:52,774
Let's go, boys, we gotta be
in Candia by 2:00. Oh, FYl:

798
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:56,350
This team we're playing is notorious
for egging comic-book conventions.

799
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:57,884
Destroy them!

800
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,845
Howie, you're a freak.

801
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,355
Edgar, let's get this Gus Bus
on the road.

802
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,824
Game three, Benchwarmers vs,
Standard Fence at Candia City Park,

803
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,428
- Are we here?
- Loser!

804
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:11,692
I think we are.

805
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,632
It's sixth inning and the Benchwarmers
are down by one run...

806
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,237
...with Clark Reedy up on deck.

807
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,211
- Clark, hold the bat.
- Wait. Why?

808
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,073
- That's good.
- What are you doing?

809
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,146
- Oh, I see.
- It's gonna be great.

810
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,549
Hey, Richie! I look like a mummy!

811
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,224
- God, it worked!
- Clark got a hit!

812
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,324
- Awesome!
- The other way!

813
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,290
Come on, run it out!

814
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,997
Let's go! Yeah!

815
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,225
And Richie scores!
That ties it up, four to four!

816
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,062
I made it! I made it! Yeah!

817
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,034
Clark, bend down.

818
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,516
What the heck was that?
I mean, come on!

819
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,212
What a moron!

820
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:16,059
The ball gets away from the catcher!
Gus goes to second!

821
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,868
Go! He missed it!

822
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,230
Hey! What the...? Let go!

823
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,267
- Go, Gus, go!
- You got it!

824
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:29,275
- Come on, over here! Third!
- I got it! You got it. You got it.

825
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,739
Get the ball! Get the ball! Home!

826
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,645
Yeah!

827
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,621
It burns.

828
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,484
- Hot.
- It burns. It burns.

829
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,060
And the Benchwarmers win it, 5-4,

830
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,264
Look at all these people.
We're like the Beatles.

831
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:57,667
Or Wham! .

832
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,467
Get your Benchwarmers souvenirs.

833
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,610
Slide rules, pocket protectors,
pennants.

834
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,143
We got everything you need.

835
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,950
Welcome to Brookdale for game four.
Benchwarmers ball is on the Internet.

836
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,581
Coach Bellows, Gus Matthews
from the Benchwarmers.

837
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,312
Shake hands
and have a good game.

838
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,889
Matthews. That sounds familiar.
You from around here?

839
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,057
No.

840
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,355
I grew up on the North Pole.

841
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,997
Not even close to here.

842
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,132
And here's the pitch.

843
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,866
It's a high fly ball!

844
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,482
Bad news.
The Benchwarmers are behind, 2-0.

845
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,952
Gus is up. Clark's on third.

846
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,622
He smacked that one!

847
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:57,895
- No!
- Relax.

848
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,331
This game is all tied up.

849
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,850
- Richie hit a four-footer.
- Go, Richie!

850
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,816
Run it out! Run it out! Get there!

851
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,215
He's safe! He's safe! He's safe!

852
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,699
- Way to go! Run it out!
- He's rounding third.

853
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,932
Richie scores!

854
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,572
Clark overran third base.

855
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,606
Safe!
- Yeah!

856
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,914
Too high! Bad idea! Call 911!

857
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:51,952
That was close. Benchwarmers, 3-2.
Brookdale Glass is shattered!

858
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,957
- Hey, could we please leave, Mel?
- What? Oh, yeah, sure.

859
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,716
Gus!

860
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,124
Gus, maybe this'll relax you.

861
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,265
Fresh off the presses
of The Daily Shmegmer.

862
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,559
- We're on the front page.
- No way!

863
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:08,761
"Benchwarmers Get Hizzot
and Rizoll Into Semi-Fizinals."

864
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,270
Mel, if my wife sees this,
I'm totally busted.

865
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,965
Do not fret, my good man.

866
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:16,236
Number 7 is covering
Clark's paper route.

867
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,682
Problem solved, Gus,

868
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,525
Welcome to the semifinals
of Mel's tournament.

869
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:34,493
Wayne's Hardware stands between
the Benchwarmers and the final game.

870
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:38,225
Meanwhile, the nerd fans
are attempting their first wave ever.

871
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,159
Hey, Jerry, what's going on?

872
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,531
Who's this?

873
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:46,402
I wanted you guys to have a little edge
today, so I brought my friend Carlos.

874
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,671
He is from the Dominican Republic,
and he is one incredible ball player.

875
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,246
Carlos, that's great.

876
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,644
- How old are you?
- I am 12.

877
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,813
More like 1200.

878
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,655
Check my birth certificate.

879
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,289
He's legit.

880
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,789
You're kidding.
This is green crayon.

881
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,896
That's your kid?

882
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,970
Well, thanks a lot, Jerry,
but my team kicks ass.

883
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,142
- I think we'll be fine.
- Well, he's here if you need him.

884
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,205
- I need a refill.
- You need to go to an AA meeting.

885
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,545
No, really. I need a refill.

886
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,789
Here, hold this.

887
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,055
Look, a vampire.

888
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,431
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

889
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,608
Strike three!

890
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,418
It's a hit parade!

891
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,454
Time-out!

892
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,362
It's about time. You're in, you're in.
Give me that.

893
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,798
Come on, hombre,
We need mucho home run-o's.

894
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,674
- Dude, you smell like beer.
- You look like beer.

895
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,446
- Hey, who the hell's this guy?
- Sorry.

896
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,623
- Is he on your roster?
- Yeah, of course he is.

897
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,190
He wasrt well earlier,
so I couldn't play him.

898
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,623
Mi tummy es sick-o.

899
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,354
This guy's 50. He's got a mustache.

900
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,123
Not according to birth "certifico."

901
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,073
He's got documentation. Play ball!

902
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,117
Get out of here, baby!
Get out of here, baby!

903
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,448
Yeah!

904
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,325
Oh, shit,

905
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,159
Howie, listen, take this money...

906
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,597
...go buy beer and tequila,
and come right back.

907
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:29,067
- Don't be scared.
- I don't wanna do that.

908
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,671
Go, go, go.

909
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,739
- Nelson.
- You're all right.

910
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,169
Strike three!

911
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,845
You gotta step in the batter's box.

912
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,614
I'm gonna kill your family.

913
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:52,655
Yes!

914
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,463
- Yeah!
- Gone!

915
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,934
Looks like the Gus Bus
is out of gas.

916
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,736
I got it! I got it!

917
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,472
That's what I'm talking about!

918
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,621
Third inning, and the Benchwarmers
cling to a one-run lead.

919
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,384
Your hair is like a waterfall.

920
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,424
- Thank you.
- Carlos.

921
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,256
Who say my name?

922
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,791
This is a present
from the Benchwarmers.

923
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,992
You're really good at baseball.
Awesome.

924
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,801
Gracias, albino. Now get lost!

925
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:42,873
Two outs and the Benchwarmers
hanging on, 6-5.

926
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,112
- Go, go, go!
- Gus, go!

927
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,003
- Safe!
- Yes! He did it!

928
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,334
- He did it!
- No way! God!

929
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,511
My hand!

930
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,243
Top of the sixth,
Benchwarmers leading, 7-5.

931
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,318
That looks rough, dude.
Is it broken?

932
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,288
It's not broken, but I can't pitch.

933
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,223
- Richie, can you pitch?
- Hell, no, dude. I can't even catch.

934
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,456
- My vote is to have Clark pitch.
- Wait, why me?

935
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,533
You throw newspapers.
You have to have some arm.

936
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:42,705
- Come on, come on. Let's go, guys.
- Clark, we have no other choice.

937
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,271
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll play the outfield.

938
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,909
I can still catch pop flies.

939
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,944
I'll try.

940
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,907
I wonder if Clark pitched before.

941
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,287
- Nope.
- Come on, really burn it in.

942
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,720
Ball three.

943
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,394
Come on.

944
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,062
Ball four. Take your base.

945
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:11,256
Two-run lead. Bases are loaded,
and Carlos is coming up.

946
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,439
One run scores.

947
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,842
The tying run scores.

948
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,583
Here comes the lead run!
And he is...

949
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,450
- Out!
- Oh, my God! What a play!

950
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,658
We go to the bottom of the last inning,
and it's all tied up.

951
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,665
Carlos, we need tres more outs
to go into extra innings.

952
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,164
Is that beer?

953
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:48,235
No, it's Gatorade, honky.
Just give me the ball.

954
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,965
The Benchwarmers need something
against Carlos. He's unittable.

955
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,140
It's a live ball! Run it out!
Clark, run it out!

956
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,381
Yes!

957
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:10,552
Maria...

958
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,921
...why did you leave me?

959
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,798
Letting a 12-year-old drink like that
is disgusting.

960
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,366
Here we go, Richie, here we go!

961
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:23,028
- Ball!
- Come on, ump, he's ducking it!

962
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,302
Here we go, Richie, here we go!

963
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,703
Take your base.

964
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,714
Gus is up, and here's the pitch.

965
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,250
Safe!

966
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:44,389
Hey, who's on deck?

967
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,563
- Damn!
- Oh, no. They don't have anyone else.

968
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,393
- They have to forfeit.
- What?

969
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,865
- You have any reserve players?
- No.

970
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,402
What about that guy over there
eating sun block?

971
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,401
He's never played before.

972
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,443
That's not my problem.
He's got a uniform.

973
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:10,010
Hey, either he plays
or you forfeit the game. Play ball!

974
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:15,148
Last inning, winning rurs on third,
and it's all up to Howie.

975
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:25,126
- Look at this freak.
- Son, son. Get in the batter's box.

976
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,427
Someone get his sword.

977
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,334
- Here you go, Howie. Take this.
- Nelson. Nelson.

978
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:32,802
Get up and take a swing.

979
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,805
Look at all those albinos.

980
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,111
Wait till he pitches the ball, retard.

981
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,443
Strike!

982
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,987
They should let him use his sword.

983
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,793
Maria!

984
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,193
- No.
- Come on, weird guy!

985
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,796
Weird guy! Weird guy! Weird guy!

986
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:11,978
Take the base.

987
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,845
- No way! We win! We win!
- Amazing!

988
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,682
- You have to touch first base, kid.
- Come on, come on.

989
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,791
Howie, hit by the pitch,
forces in the winning run...

990
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:26,325
...and sends the Benchwarmers
to the finals!

991
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:27,928
That's game.

992
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,333
Carlos, you're drunk!

993
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,067
We're here with Richie Goodman
of the Benchwarmers.

994
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,643
How do you feel after that win?

995
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,939
What can I say?
Baseball's in my blood.

996
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:50,882
Hey, could I give a shout-out
to my main salad girl at Pizza Hut?

997
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,682
I like salad,

998
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,119
Guys, can you believe this crap?

999
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,228
I'd like to beat his ass,
just like I did back in the diz-ay.

1000
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,661
- Are they any good?
- The only guy that's good is that guy.

1001
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,627
This is Gus Matthews, the heart
and soul of the Benchwarmers,

1002
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,304
Gus Matthews?

1003
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:10,767
So were you bullied as a kid?

1004
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:15,837
The bully thing affected my life pretty
huge, and I wanna tell you kids,,,

1005
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,309
,,, messing with other kids
can do a lot of damage,

1006
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:22,143
What? That guy damaged more kids
than anybody I knew.

1007
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,013
He made my life hell growing up.

1008
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,814
You're twice his size.
You could crush that little puke.

1009
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,048
He didn't do the physical warfare.

1010
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:32,227
He played the psychological card
by attacking your weaknesses.

1011
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,692
I started losing my hair
when I was 9 years old.

1012
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,297
He jumped all over it
with the mean nicknames.

1013
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,365
Eight Ball, Bowling Ball...

1014
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,037
...Kojak, Mr. Clean,
Cream of Wheat Guy...

1015
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,300
...Scatman Crothers,
the Black Uncle Fester.

1016
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,273
How about the
Black Bodybuilding Charlie Brown?

1017
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,673
That's a good one.

1018
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,711
He used that too!

1019
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,977
Oh, don't cry, buddy.
I think your hair's the bomb, yo.

1020
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:02,248
- It looks great. Doesrt it, guys?
- Yeah.

1021
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,686
- Really, brothers?
- Yeah.

1022
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,919
Sure, Daddy Warbucks. I would've
never have thought that was a wig.

1023
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,893
If I was blindfolded.

1024
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,961
Got a problem? Why don't you punch
me in the face as hard as you can.

1025
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,901
Pour some honey on me.
Let me see you get really mad.

1026
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,775
Anyway, at least I left there
with my sanity.

1027
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,609
He actually teased this one midget boy
in our neighborhood league so bad...

1028
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,980
...the little fella up and quit baseball
and went into the loony bin.

1029
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,314
Guys, we gotta tell Jerry.
He's gonna love this.

1030
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:35,918
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

1031
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:39,285
Really? Well, thanks, Cassandra.

1032
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:42,589
- What's the score now, Mel?
- Well, Jerry's Lumber just won, 5-2.

1033
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,664
That means our town
gets the stadium!

1034
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,734
Nelson and his buddies will,
because we'll kill those guys!

1035
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,404
Yeah! Wicked!

1036
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,130
- Number 7, shakes all around!
- Yes!

1037
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:53,638
I gotta take a leak.

1038
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:56,403
Down the hall,
12th door on the right.

1039
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,078
Last night, we did a story
about the Benchwarmers,,,

1040
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:05,948
,,, a team of three men who were
excluded from baseball as kids,,,

1041
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,816
,,, and are now making up
for lost time,

1042
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,119
Hello, Gus,
This is the urinal speaking,

1043
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:15,957
Chemical analysis of your pee shows
you'd better stop eating fast food,,,

1044
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,099
,,, or you're going to die,

1045
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,569
We have just been given evidence
that one of the men, Gus Matthews,,,

1046
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:25,002
,,, is not the man
he's been saying he is,

1047
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,472
Hey, no shake for me.
The toilet said so.

1048
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,111
Gus Matthews was easily
the biggest bully in Brookdale,

1049
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,280
Well, you werert the nicest kid
in school either, Steven,

1050
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,116
I hate everybody!

1051
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,015
What a baby, But he's right,

1052
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:42,385
I was their principal back then,
and Gus was in my office constantly,

1053
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,924
I remember he especially
picked so hard on one kid,,,

1054
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,959
,,, that the poor boy
was institutionalized,

1055
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:51,395
That's really too bad, Those guys
inspired a lot of really nice kids,

1056
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,593
This is Kathy Dobson
from Channel 9 news,

1057
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:59,135
You were a jerk just like the rest
of the kids who mess with me?

1058
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,538
I made a mistake, Nelson.

1059
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,244
I wish I could take it all back.

1060
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,380
I can't believe I looked up to you.

1061
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,617
I don't know what to say, guys.

1062
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:20,828
I'm sorry.

1063
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,500
Let's party!

1064
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,105
Not now, Number 7!

1065
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:39,540
Is that why you don't
wanna have kids, Gus?

1066
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:46,282
Do you feel you don't deserve
a happy family because of your past?

1067
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:51,617
I'm afraid that if we have kids, they're
gonna get picked on without mercy...

1068
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,661
...because karma
will be catching up with me.

1069
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:59,163
Sweetheart, you are wrong.
Life's about learning lessons.

1070
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:01,862
I can't just learn a lesson
and move on.

1071
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,537
That little boy that I picked on
when I was a kid...

1072
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,968
...he didn't ever move on.

1073
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:10,145
I bet he'd be able to move on
if you said you were sorry.

1074
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,792
Can I help you?

1075
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,794
- Marcus, honey.
- What is it, Mother?

1076
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:32,291
I just finished another peanut butter
sculpture. It's a pterodactyl.

1077
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:37,295
Oh, that's nice.
You have a visitor, dear.

1078
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,504
But I don't know anyone.

1079
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,942
It's Gus from grade school.

1080
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,808
No!

1081
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,782
Don't come down here!

1082
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,885
- Marcus...
- No, don't come down!

1083
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,557
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1084
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,988
- Don't touch me!
- Please, hear me out.

1085
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,991
Just give me a chance.

1086
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,325
Marcus, stop trying to cast spells.

1087
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,868
- Marcus...
- Stay away!

1088
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,170
Look, Marcus, I want to apologize...

1089
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:19,712
...for all the nasty things I did to you
when we were kids.

1090
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,383
I'm not here to mess with you.

1091
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,678
You're lying to me
like all the other times.

1092
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,548
You are denied entry.

1093
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,883
I'm sorry,
from the bottom of my heart.

1094
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,888
I was stupid, Marcus.

1095
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:35,792
Get out of my basement!
You're a bad, bad man! Go! Get out!

1096
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,125
I didn't expect you to forgive me.
I mean...

1097
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,898
Look, I know because of me...

1098
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,866
...you were never able to feel
what it was like to play ball...

1099
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,972
...or be part of a team.

1100
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:49,835
So I wanna
give you my hat, Marcus.

1101
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,711
Because even though
you didn't know it...

1102
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,509
...you are the heart and soul
of this squad.

1103
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,251
I'll see you around, buddy.

1104
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,266
Start here.

1105
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:17,906
- You've got 24 hours.
- What, are you serious?

1106
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,467
If you build it, nerds will come.

1107
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:25,870
And keep it under a billion.
It's all I've got...

1108
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:27,579
...on me.

1109
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,476
Excellent!

1110
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:32,085
Okay, people!

1111
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:36,349
We got 24 hours to build us
a ballpark! Can we do it?

1112
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,356
Yeah!

1113
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:58,981
Cool!

1114
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:03,083
Are you kidding me? Look at this.
Dude, this place is huge!

1115
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,913
- Swings!
- We'll go on the swings later.

1116
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,215
- Slide.
- That's right, there's a pool.

1117
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:11,086
- We'll all go in after.
- I forgot my floaties.

1118
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,853
We're here live in Greenfield
for the big game...

1119
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,463
...between the Benchwarmers
and Jerry's Lumber.

1120
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,327
The Benchwarmers were
recently rocked by scandal.

1121
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,264
Let's see what the fans have to say.

1122
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,405
Excuse me, sir. What do you think
of the accusations against Gus?

1123
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:28,134
His soul will perish in the fire pit
of the underworld.

1124
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:34,449
There you have it, The fire pits,
Not a good time,

1125
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,942
Around the horn.

1126
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,217
We could still win this thing.

1127
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,983
- Wha...? How?
- Lf we use the Force.

1128
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,888
Let's try not to be too geeky, Clark.

1129
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,825
The Force is powerful,
my young padawan.

1130
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,726
He's right. It is.

1131
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,460
Hey, guys.

1132
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:58,265
I know I'm not
on the team anymore...

1133
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,705
...but I just wanted you to know that
I'm here to support you.

1134
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,336
Because you'll always be
my best friends.

1135
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:09,751
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Shmegmer Park...

1136
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:13,012
...and the final game
of Mel's Tournament...

1137
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:17,022
...of Little Baseballers
and Three Older Guys!

1138
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:20,995
Homo!

1139
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,657
Hey, check out the little gnome.

1140
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:29,133
Play ball!

1141
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,166
Can I say something?

1142
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,173
Yeah, I guess so.

1143
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:40,076
Hand me the mike, please.
I can't reach it.

1144
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:46,248
Hello, everyone.
My name is Marcus Ellwood...

1145
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,583
...better known
as Dragonmaster784.

1146
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,693
Or Yoda! Or Midget Boy!

1147
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:59,597
It is true I ended up in an institution
as a child...

1148
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,362
...from Gus bullying me all the time.

1149
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:05,638
And he made my life miserable
for years.

1150
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:10,244
To be honest, I thought I would never
stop hating him.

1151
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,114
But then yesterday
he came to visit me in my basement.

1152
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:21,619
And as I cowered in my peanut butter
fort, he apologized to me.

1153
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,252
And I could hear the sadness
in his voice.

1154
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,554
This nerd makes me
seem like Rambo.

1155
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:28,889
I don't think so.

1156
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,464
- John Stamos?
- Warmer.

1157
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:35,894
And then, moments
after my old nemesis left...

1158
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:38,835
...I saw a hat on my stuffed moose.

1159
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,100
The hat of a Benchwarmer.

1160
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:46,238
A Benchwarmer begging
for a new start, just like me...

1161
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,210
...and so many of you.

1162
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:52,251
He shouldn't get a new start! I'll never
forgive the kids who picked on me!

1163
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:53,421
Yeah!

1164
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:57,888
Young one,
life is too short to harbor hatred.

1165
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:01,456
Do you remember episode
number 38 of Dungeon Wars?

1166
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,566
The golden elves forgive the great
giants for destroying their village...

1167
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:12,069
...even though the giants
made the elves' life hell.

1168
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:15,673
The elves realized the giants
were tortured too.

1169
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,546
He's a modern-day Yoda.

1170
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:26,312
I mean, not his looks
but his philosophy stuff.

1171
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:30,420
- Actually, his looks too. Yeah.
- His looks a little bit too, yeah.

1172
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:34,995
And so I forgive my new friend Gus,
as all of you should.

1173
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:39,461
Look at all the joy and hope
he's brought to all of us.

1174
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,097
He has more than paid his dues.

1175
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,531
- Go, Gus!
- Come on, Marcus!

1176
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,609
Thank you, Marcus. Come on.

1177
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,551
- Hey. Buddies for life.
- Thanks.

1178
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:01,418
- I want a little man too.
- Here you go.

1179
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:13,227
Me and the guys have been playing
all these games, not for revenge.

1180
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:17,030
We did it to show that everyone
should be allowed to play baseball...

1181
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,467
...and have fun.

1182
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:26,207
And that is why Clark, Richie and I
will not be playing in the game today.

1183
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:31,786
Instead, our team will consist of
kids who've never known...

1184
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,922
...what it's like to play in front
of a crowd or to be cheered on.

1185
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,319
Let me tell you,
it's an awesome feeling.

1186
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:41,189
So please, put your nerd
and jock hands together...

1187
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:44,662
...and welcome to the field
the new Benchwarmers!

1188
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,934
- Yeah!
- Hi!

1189
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,566
All right!

1190
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:54,198
Now, lastly, let's make some noise
for your new third-base coach:

1191
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,968
Marcus Ellwood!

1192
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:00,704
Is he all right?

1193
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,286
For years I thought the sun
was a monster.

1194
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:08,616
I'm here to tell you that it's not
a monster. It's not a monster!

1195
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,689
- You're all right.
- Take him in the shade.

1196
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,724
All right, let's have some fun!

1197
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:14,657
Hey, everybody,
it's Clark and Richie,,,

1198
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,093
,,, and we're standing in
for Gretchen and Mitchell,

1199
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:20,029
And we're gonna get things going
right now. Big deck.

1200
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,827
He got it.

1201
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,604
Oh, no.

1202
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:26,802
And he's okay.

1203
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,375
Oh, hey, that's my helmet!
That's my helmet!

1204
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,273
It's all right, buddy.

1205
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,107
Nice try, Sammy!

1206
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:36,375
Oh, my God, I just saw
your head for the first time.

1207
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:39,611
Let's give a nice round of applause
for little Sammy Sprinkler!

1208
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,619
He missed it
and people are cheering.

1209
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,159
Yeah, and his coach
didn't even yell at him.

1210
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,486
That's pretty cool.

1211
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:49,460
And here comes our lead-off hitter
with a familiar tape job.

1212
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,963
Gretchen, I know why
you're taping your hands.

1213
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:56,828
I also know why there's three squirrels
that won't be at this game today.

1214
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,308
Strike! Strike! Strike!

1215
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,738
Well, there's a strikeout.

1216
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,936
That's okay! Good try! Good try!

1217
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,507
Good going, Gretchen.

1218
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,546
All right, next up it's Jarrett.

1219
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:12,187
If you know Jarrett, you know his sister
works at Pizza Hut. She's over there.

1220
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:17,753
Another strikeout.

1221
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:22,662
And a strikeout. Strikeout.

1222
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,799
Strikeout. Strikeout. Strikeout.

1223
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:26,865
And a strikeout.

1224
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,037
I think we got a free stadium!

1225
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,967
Clark, we're beating them
in strikeouts.

1226
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,937
And you're also beating them
in boogers picked, so we got that.

1227
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:41,310
Good game. Drive home safe tonight.
On the yellow brick road.

1228
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,212
God, he's a dick.

1229
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,388
He got all of that one.
Back, back, back!

1230
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:52,787
In the pool!

1231
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,559
Good hit, Kyle.

1232
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,460
Yeah, nice one, Kyle.

1233
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,056
Go, Kyle!

1234
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,437
Well, it's 42 to nothing as we head
into the last inning.

1235
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,337
And it looks like the Benchwarmers
will go down without a fight.

1236
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,769
Hey. What are you smiling at?

1237
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,913
I guess how much fun
they're having.

1238
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,675
Wipe the smile off your face
or I'll wipe it off for you.

1239
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:16,908
You got three more outs.

1240
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,020
You blow this shutout, you won't play
on a team next year. Got it?

1241
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,383
Get out there and annihilate
those stinkweeds!

1242
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,716
Let's go!

1243
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,861
Come on, let's do this!

1244
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:30,658
Strike one!

1245
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,163
Hang in there, son!

1246
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,024
Come on, Nelson!

1247
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:36,737
Strike two!

1248
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,702
Come on, strike out this loser!

1249
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:42,306
You know what? You're the loser.

1250
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:45,676
Time!

1251
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,615
- What's up, buddy?
- Hey, Nelson.

1252
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,377
- I'll throw you one down the middle.
- What does that mean?

1253
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,215
It means choke up on the bat a little
and swing away.

1254
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:57,449
- The ball's gonna be right there.
- Hey, thanks.

1255
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,719
I can help you with your social studies
homework later if you need it.

1256
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,762
Sounds good.
I suck at social studies.

1257
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,900
Okay, guys, follow my lead.

1258
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,104
- Butterfingers.
- He got a hit!

1259
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,107
- Come on! Go, go!
- Oh, my God!

1260
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:18,936
Why are you kicking it?!

1261
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,375
Go, go!

1262
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,582
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

1263
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:34,592
Run! Come on! Go! Go! Go home!

1264
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:36,058
- Go, go, go!
- Go, Nelson!

1265
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,130
Nelson, get at the plate!

1266
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,728
Slide! Slide!

1267
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:42,904
Safe!

1268
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,331
We did not get shut out!

1269
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:06,518
What is going on? What is going on?
Let go of me! Nerds!

1270
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,294
You put me down!
What is going on?

1271
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:37,456
- Can I let you in on a secret?
- Sure.

1272
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:42,323
I've never actually, like, totally,
100-percent kissed a girl before...

1273
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:46,694
...and I was wondering
if you would be my first one.

1274
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,630
I would like nothing more than that.

1275
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,800
Rea...?

1276
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:54,202
Clark!

1277
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,037
You kissed a girl before I did?

1278
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,276
This is way better than macaroni.

1279
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:07,551
I'm not afraid of the sun anymore.

1280
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:10,554
That's good, buddy.
How's the moon treating you?

1281
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:12,249
Not a fan.

1282
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:17,493
Hey, Gus. The new Benchwarmers
are gonna need a coach next season.

1283
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,030
What do you say?

1284
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:20,496
I'd be honored, Mel...

1285
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:23,466
...but I might be a little busy
getting my family started.

1286
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:27,531
Actually, honey,
it's already been started.

1287
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,072
Really?

1288
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:34,845
Hey, everybody!

1289
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:37,249
I'm gonna be a dad!

1290
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:47,086
- That's quite an ovation.
- You wanna hear an even bigger one?

1291
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:51,356
The reason she's pregnant is
because I went all the way with her!

1292
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,007
That's so great.
What does "all the way" mean?

1293
01:18:10,008 --> 01:18:24,108
THE END
