169
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,620
No tan lines this morning.

170
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,590
<i>Looks nice.</i>

171
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,010

<i>[Rumsfield Sighs]
Peterson.</i>

173
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,600
He came out in his robe last night when
the foreigners were making that racket.

174
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,730
He didn't do one thing.

175
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,450
<i>- [Continues]
- So, what are you gonna do first?</i>

176
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,440
I don't know.

177
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,110
- Hey, did I show you my new tools?
- No.

178
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,610
These are great.
[Clears Throat]

179
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,790
Carol's father gave them
to me for Christmas.

[Grunts]
Huh?

181
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,130
- Look.
- Oh, those are beauties.

182
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,000
- You gonna build something with those?
- I think so.

183
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,010
<i>Probably.</i>

184
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,130
Hey, what time does
the ball game go on?

185
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,380
I think it's at about 1:00.

186
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,760
<i>You want to go down to the deli
and get one of those beef sandwiches?</i>

187
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,800
<i>No. I'm thinking of getting one of
those electric garage door openers...</i>

188
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,810
<i>- [Door Creaking]
- And installing it.</i>

192
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,480
<i>Ray, come here.</i>

193
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,200
What is it?

194
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,490
It's my neighbour.

195
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:31,130
Hey, one of the Huns
came out of the cave.

196
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,030
Why don't you go say hi?

197
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,690
Well, yeah, I guess I could.

198
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,710
This would be
the perfect time.

199
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,120
If you go talk to him,
we could see what he's like. Go.

200
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,540
[Ray]
You could say hi to him too.

201
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,000
- But he's your neighbour.
- No, he's your neighbour as well.

202
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,380
But you share a property line with him.

203
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,040
We're all on the same block,
so you could go too.

204
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,220
We're all in the same town,
but you're next to him.

205
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,550
<i>If he was gonna borrow anything,
he'd come over to your place.</i>

206
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,260
<i>Well, he's busy now.</i>

207
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,840
He's not busy. Now he's goin' in.
Go now because if...

208
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,600
<i>He's going back in. If you were
gonna say hi, you should probably...</i>

209
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,140
He's going into the house.
You're gonna lose him.

210
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,560
<i>He's gonna go in...</i>

211
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,890
- Now you've blown it, haven't you?
- No, I didn't blow it.

212
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,060
- Chicken. Chicken. [Clucking]
- He went into his house.

213
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm not chicken because
he went into his house.

214
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,990
You look like a chicken in front of
your son and everything. Your son.

215

- Hey, hey, it's a joke!

- Let's say hello.
- Why so edgy?

218
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,620
- Come on, come on.
- Try decaf.

219
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,580
They're daring each other
to ring the doorbell.

220
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,870
- We shouldn't stare like this.
- [Chuckles]

221
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,590
Why don't we both go say hello,
or are you chicken?

222
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,720
Go for it, Mr Peterson!
Yes!

223
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,930

- Yeah, okay, yeah.</i>

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,100

Sure. No problem.

<i>- They got holes in their porch too.

- You okay?
- Yeah.

231
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,300
- I'm not gonna pay for that.
- We shouldn't pay for that. We should sue them.

232
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,630
[Sighs] Well, um, let's...
Let's say hello.

233
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,660
Hey.

- Get the hose. Hang on, men!

236
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,090

<i>[Ray] I think they're gone, Mark.
I think they're gone!</i>

243
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,700
- You men hit?
- I cannot believe you did that.

244
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,860
- Neither can I.
- I cannot believe it! That was great.

245
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,710
The same thing happened to me
last week. I was over there.

246
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,040
It wasn't bees though.
It was a foaming squirrel.

247
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,500
In Southeast Asia, we'd call
this type of thing "bad karma."

over here, huh?

- Yeah, green sky tonight.

Green sky at morning:
Neighbour take warning.

Green sky at night?

271
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,850
Neighbour take flight.

<i>Did you ever see the movie
The Sentinel, Mr Peterson?</i>

273

It's about the old guy

274
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,640
which is kind of like
the gateway to hell.

275

They're movin' around again.

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,960
It was a night just like this
that it happened.

282
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,960
What happened,
Mr Weingartner?

283
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,470
It was a long time ago.
Hinkley Hills was a lot smaller then.

284
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,800
Safer too. You never had to lock
your doors. Everybody knew everybody.

285
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,310
I must have been maybe
nine, ten years old.

286
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,310
- You know where the big mall is?
- Yeah.

287
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,470
There used to be a big drugstore
on the corner there.

288
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,650
- It had a big soda fountain. Remember?
- Yeah.

289
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,820
The guy who ran it was a rotund guy,
had glasses.

290
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,480
His name was Skip.
Lived over on Elm.

291
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,820
Had a wife, a couple kids.
Not too sharp.

292
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,490
The guy's 40 years old, he's wearing
a paper hat and making cherry Cokes.

293
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,150
It's a cinch he's not
running for governor, right?

294
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,650
Anyway, it got hot that summer.

295
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,830
It got real hot.
It was sweltering.

296
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,490
<i>That heat where your underwear sweats

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,170
And they start smelling
this really vile stench over on Elm...

299
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,010
and they figure it's comin'
from Skip's place.

300
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,000
No one wants to say anything.

301
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,340
Do you knock on the guy's door,
"Hi, your house stinks"?

302
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,000
So people are trying
to ignore it, right?

303
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,680
They're trying to pretend it isn't
happening. You know those pine things?

304
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,850
They're trying to cover up with those
pine things that you can put in cars.

305
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,020
People are hanging those
on their porches.

- Oh, you think that's funny, Ricky?
- Well, yeah.

308
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,850
Let me tell you
what happened next.

309
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,360
The state health inspector shows up.
They talk to Skip.

310
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,530
He says he's got a sump pump problem.
They leave.

311
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,820
The guy's got a sewer problem.
He says he'll look after it.

312
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,700
Everything's okay, right?

313
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,700
Wrong.
A couple hours later...

314
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,080
there's smoke pouring out
of the windows of Skip's house.

315
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,210
- The firemen go in. Know what they find?
- What?

316
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,870
Skip's family, dead.
Murdered...

317
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,580
by Skip... weeks earlier...
with an ice pick.

318
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,760
<i>Yeah, the guy killed
his whole family...</i>

319

- [Gulps]
- With an ice pick.

320
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,720
Yeah. Yeah, just put 'em
in the cool basement...

321
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,390
covered 'em up with a sheet and went
back to makin' treats for the townsfolk.

322
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,060
Only Skip didn't count on there
being a big heat wave that summer.

323
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,900
You know what all those people
were smelling on Elm, Ricky?

324
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,060
What?

325
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,400
Skip's family's bodies...

326
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,070
- decomposing in the summer heat.
- [Whistles]

327
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,240
Apparently, one day Skip made

- His wig.
- The Klopeks were picking up his mail.

So they keep to themselves!

01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:11,580
do not mess with suburbanites because,
uh, we're not gonna take it any more.

1296
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,540
We're not gonna be content
to look after our lawns...

1297
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:15,460
and wax our cars, paint our houses.

1298
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:18,670
We're out to get 'em, Don.
We are out to get them.

1299
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:24,890
- Hello.
- Hi.

1300
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:30,760
[Sighs]
So, what are you gonna do now?

1301
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:35,020
I'm gonna pack a bag
and go up to the lake.

1302
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:37,020
We got 'em, neighbour.

1303
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,770
- Get away from him.
- [Art] Hey, you guys.

1304
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,700
You wanna go down to Bowl-O-Rama
for a beer or something?

1305
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,480
Man, that was an incredible choke hold
you put on me, pal. The guy's a brute.

1306
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:50,490
How's that finger?
Is it okay?

1307
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:52,660
Where are you guys going?
Where you going?

1308
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:55,370
I'm going on vacation.

1309
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,780
"Vacation"?
What, are you crazy?

1310
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,920
This is a major media event here.

1311
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:03,950
Geraldo Rivera's coming, and he's gonna
excavate the basement of the Klopeks!

1312
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:08,210
It's gonna be broadcast
on satellite all over the world, live!

1313
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,210
Art!

1314
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:13,180
Your wife's home.

1315
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:16,930
- And your house is on fire!
- Art, where are you?

1316
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:19,640
My wife is home!

1317
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:22,930
Mr Peterson, where you going?

1318
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:25,980
It's just starting to get good.

1319
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:28,910
I'm going away for a while, Ricky.

1320
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,910
I want you to keep an eye
on the neighbourhood for me.

1321
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,700
You betcha, Mr Peterson.

1322
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:41,710
<i>No problem.</i>

1323
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,670
[Barking]

1324
01:36:57,430 --> 01:36:59,390
God, I love this street.
