1
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,826
I think I'm being followed.

2
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,287
Then we have little time.

3
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,205
He has discovered the map.

4
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,960
How?

5
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:14,844
<i>If he has the map, It's only a matter of time</i>

6
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,888
<i>Before he discovers the location of the box.</i>

7
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,516
What of the four bodies
left behind in the caves?

8
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,228
He killed his own men.

9
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,614
<i>Luger plays the game at</i>
<i>an altogether different level,</i>

10
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,658
one almost admires him.

11
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,249
There is one more thing.

12
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:48,920
Charity.

13
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,094
So where's the amulet now?

14
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,312
There are those
who would describe the removal

15
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:51,399
of the Roman marbles
as vandalism and looting.

16
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,110
I perhaps would agree with them.

17
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,030
But in these times of greed and avarice,

18
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,491
the removal of the marbles by Lord Bevan

19
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,162
may actually have saved them
from an even worse fate.

20
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,581
Even during the Greek war of independence,

21
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,958
the besieged Ottoman forces

22
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,878
were attempting to melt
the lead in the columns of the Parthenon...

23
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,171
This is so boring.

24
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,297
to cast bullets.

25
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,299
But at the London Museum,

26
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,844
we cannot dismiss the importance of these
treasures to the Greeks.

27
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,347
Who, even during this time of war,

28
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,686
actually gave the enemy
bullets to save their great temple.

29
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,862
A sacrifice that put the stones of history

30
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,364
above the lives of their own men.

31
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,286
Felix!

32
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,040
Come on, Felix. Father will be annoyed.

33
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,221
Impressive, isn't it?

34
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,892
Looks just like a stone to me.

35
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,521
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,356
No, this is a key

37
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,402
to unlocking an entire civilization, Mariah.

38
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,489
You know me, sir?

39
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,118
Call me Will.

40
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:36,462
You see, because the text was written in both
Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphics,

41
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,550
we were able
to translate things we never could before.

42
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:45,346
Never underestimate the power
of buried treasure, my friend.

43
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,769
You're bleeding, sir.

44
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,066
Oh...

45
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,693
Looks that way, doesn't it?

46
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,611
Be a good man...

47
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,613
Get your parents for me.

48
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,365
I have something...

49
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:07,159
Rather important to tell them.

50
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:11,539
Spectacular!

51
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,416
Oh, you're in so much trouble.

52
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,960
Mama, Mariah killed someone.

53
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,548
- On here.
- Steady there, man!

54
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,841
Will, Will?

55
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,719
Will... Will, what happened?

56
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,597
He's found it. He's found the map.

57
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,058
It's only a matter of time
before he finds the box.

58
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,768
Are you sure it's the box?

59
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,104
You think I got this from playing checkers?

60
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,402
I see you've been
<i>up</i> to your usual antics, Charity.

61
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,989
Will, this is far too dangerous and reckless.

62
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,700
I'm sorry, I like to catch
the bad guys instead of

63
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,244
sitting around a museum, gathering dust.

64
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,290
Do you ever think you should
have married me instead, Catherine?

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,127
Catherine, you've let the boys in.

66
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,005
Mariah, Felix, let's get you back to the hotel.

67
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,429
There's something else, Catherine.

68
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,389
You're not safe.

69
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,683
I've been followed here.

70
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,936
These are two halves

71
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,687
that together make a whole.

72
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,147
Guard them with your life.

73
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,775
Do not let them get into the wrong hands.

74
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,193
Hmm?

75
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,907
- Who was that man?
- Just an old friend who needs our help.

76
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,200
Does he work for you?

77
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,701
In a way, we work together.

78
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,788
Mariah, there's a waiting carriage outside.

79
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,206
Take your brother straight to the hotel.

80
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,540
- But, sir.
- Not now!

81
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,253
You're in charge.
Take care of Felix. Understood?

82
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,342
Always remember.

83
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:49,929
Faithfulness will be
your shield as a thousand may fall and hide.

84
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,181
But no evil may ever come near you

85
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,058
with gold at your side.

86
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,312
Trust no one. Except each other.

87
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,815
I love you.

88
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:12,660
- Where's Will?
- Oh, he just got <i>up</i> and... Left.

89
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,629
- Sir, thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

90
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,550
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Mundi.

91
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,385
What's the meaning of this?

92
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,624
Felix?

93
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,773
Put this on.

94
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,441
It's chilly.

95
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,869
What's wrong?

96
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,040
I've been thinking...

97
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,168
About the man at the museum?

98
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,087
Yes.

99
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,630
And our parents.

100
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,175
- What of them?
- Well...

101
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:53,803
What do they do?

102
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,806
They're professors at Oxford. You know that.

103
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,224
Yes, but...

104
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,142
Are they though?

105
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,859
Shh...

106
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,239
Follow me.

107
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,165
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

108
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,875
Just climb down.

109
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,381
- What's happening?
- Hold on tight.

110
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,466
We have to go.

111
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,352
That's it, Felix. Keep going.

112
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,356
Ahhh!

113
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,280
Felix? Felix!

114
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:55,906
Just hold on.

115
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,241
Look at me.

116
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,869
It'll be fine.

117
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,579
No!

118
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,880
Did we really just do that?

119
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:12,464
Let's go.

120
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,450
How about we get you cleaned up, shall we?

121
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:42,620
Give me your handkerchief.

122
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,458
Mariah, look.

123
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,296
Where did you get that?

124
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,882
I don't know. It wasn't in my coat before...

125
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,300
Before the museum?

126
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:57,885
<i>Always remember,</i>

127
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,182
<i>faithfulness will be
your shield as a thousand may fall and hide.</i>

128
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,851
But no evil may ever come near you

129
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,519
with gold at your side.

130
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,861
Mother.

131
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,488
But what does it mean?

132
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,615
I don't know.

133
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,577
What about Mother and Father?

134
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,829
Do you think she knew
something was gonna happen?

135
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,709
I'm sure they're fine.

136
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,545
I'm scared.

137
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,091
I'm not going to leave you.

138
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,402
Try and get some sleep.

139
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,397
This steak is quite delicious.

140
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,443
It's a little rare, but then...

141
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,945
A bit of blood does liven <i>up</i> the palate.

142
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,238
Don't you think?

143
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,785
I'm so glad we could
have this little chat alone.

144
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,581
Your husband's been quite unhelpful,
I must say.

145
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,668
Further to the point.

146
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,173
Where is the amulet?

147
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,766
I'm going to ask you one last time.

148
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,519
Oh...

149
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,898
Charming.

150
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,109
I never really wanted children.

151
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,111
I couldn't quite see the appeal.

152
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,324
Still, I'm sure they mean a lot to you.

153
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,286
What parent doesn't cherish their children?

154
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,207
Mr. Grimm, Mr. Grendel!

155
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,043
<i>We</i> really must find her boys.

156
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,628
We're all just worried sick.

157
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,631
It's just a little hard when you don't know
exactly what they look like, sir.

158
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,136
Get off at the next stop.
Search every boarding house,

159
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,223
work house, reformatory, everywhere.
Just find them.

160
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,903
Please, sir. <i>We</i> need help.

161
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,446
Try the work house down the road.

162
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,614
- But...
- Keep moving.

163
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,658
- But, sir.
- I said, keep moving!

164
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,832
Mariah, I'm starving.

165
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,796
Wait here.

166
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,759
Here we go, chicken and sprouts.
We've got pork pies.

167
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,556
Please, sir.
Could you spare a copper? A penny or two?

168
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,266
Anything would do. Much obliged.

169
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,060
Here.

170
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:41,942
Thief!

171
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,485
What did you do?

172
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:45,696
Officer!

173
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,658
Where do you think you're going then?

174
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,354
Well, look what we have here, now.

175
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,065
Some dirty new guests.

176
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,027
Welcome to Gateshead Manor.

177
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,403
Come on!

178
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,489
- Line up!
- Get up!

179
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,157
Get a move on!

180
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,494
Stand <i>up</i> straight!

181
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,539
For your crimes,

182
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,750
you will serve the time.

183
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,420
But, first,

184
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:47,174
we have some visitors
that would like to make your acquaintance.

185
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,301
Mariah, they found us.

186
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,261
I can see that, Felix.

187
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:52,930
Oi, oi...

188
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:56,266
Sounds like
a couple of toffs took a wrong turn.

189
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,102
Do I know you?
What have you been <i>up</i> to?

190
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,979
What are you going to do?

191
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,940
What are we going to do?

192
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,026
We're not even supposed to be here.

193
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,779
Oh, is that right?

194
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,036
Look, everybody.

195
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:20,207
Lord Muck
and his little brother have come to tea.

196
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,418
One lump or two, Your Lordship?

197
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,711
Get oft him.

198
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,422
You're pulling my leg, aren't you?

199
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,385
Let's see what you're made of, shall we?

200
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:34,721
You glocky sod!

201
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,226
Felix, come on!

202
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,852
Shut the gate!

203
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:52,823
Found ya!

204
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,372
We've been looking everywhere for you.

205
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,249
That's funny.

206
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,835
So have I.

207
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,050
You've knocked my bleeding tooth out.

208
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,885
Looks like you're in a spot of trouble.

209
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,345
I feel it only fair to warn you.

210
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,724
I have studied over five
separate forms of martial art.

211
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,350
Well, study this.

212
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,020
Now that's not very gentlemanly of you.

213
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,272
Doesn't I look like a gentleman?

214
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,401
To the scaffold.

215
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,945
Mariah!

216
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,076
Get oft me! Let me go.

217
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,585
- Mariah!
- Felix!

218
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,754
- Come on, boy.
- Felix!

219
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,965
Toodle-oo, old chap.

220
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,847
- We really have to leave.
- Felix!

221
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,439
Mariah!

222
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:12,110
Mariah! Mariah! Mariah!

223
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,738
Jump!

224
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,577
- Mariah!
- Felix!

225
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,912
- No!
- No, Mariah!

226
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,872
- Mariah!
- No, Mariah! No!

227
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,707
- Mariah!
- Get oft me! Felix!

228
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,626
No! No, Felix!

229
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,503
- No, Mariah, no!
- Get oft me!

230
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,963
Please!

231
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:36,093
Mariah! Mariah!

232
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,607
Who are you?

233
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,237
Captain Will Charity.

234
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:00,033
I fought with your father
in the Abyssinian War.

235
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,994
You can trust me, Mariah.

236
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,792
Last call! All aboard!

237
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:13,046
The man behind
the disappearance of your parents and Felix

238
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,840
is someone called Otto Luger.

239
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,967
Luger has made it his life's mission

240
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:20,804
to acquire some of the most powerful and
dangerous artifacts in the world.

241
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:23,181
- What are you? Spies?
- In a way.

242
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,270
Your parents and I work for a secret
department of the government

243
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,856
called the Bureau of Antiquities.

244
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,816
<i>We</i> stop the plundering and theft

245
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,944
of powerful historic relics
from around the world.

246
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,364
If we are to find your brother, Mariah,

247
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,615
you must trust me.

248
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,034
My father says that trust is earned, sir.

249
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,205
Consider what I am about to tell you
a down payment.

250
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,543
<i>We</i> believe that Luger has discovered
the hiding place of the Midas Box.

251
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,711
The Midas Box?

252
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,213
Records dating back nearly 3,000 years ago

253
00:20:55,505 --> 00:21:00,510
describe a box that can turn
whatever you place inside to gold.

254
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,765
For one man to have such power would
be an incredibly dangerous thing.

255
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,850
He could virtually print money.

256
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,353
Gold, the very foundation of our banks,
would become worthless

257
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,273
and the world would collapse into chaos.

258
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,236
I believe there is a traitor inside the bureau

259
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,405
who has been feeding Luger information.

260
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,241
For this reason, we have to work in secret.

261
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:39,633
I've arranged for you to work as a
porter at the Prince Regent Hotel.

262
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,387
Luger bought himself the hotel.

263
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,223
You see, he would never
make himself so vulnerable

264
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,975
unless the box was in or around that hotel.

265
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,560
You're going to spy for me.

266
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,812
Spy?

267
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,105
My priority, sir, is finding my family.

268
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,942
And find them, you will. Leave your parents
to me. I'll track them down.

269
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,486
You, my friend, must focus
on finding your brother.

270
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,906
Now, here's your ticket
and letters of introduction.

271
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,826
I'll meet you once I find your parents.

272
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,588
Excuse me.

273
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,603
- Hey! Who are you?
- I ain't causing no trouble.

274
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:38,233
Hey! What?

275
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,776
Shall we, dear?

276
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:12,767
<i>You must remember, Mariah,</i>
<i>Luger is a dangerous man.</i>

277
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,645
<i>Not everything will be as It seems.</i>

278
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,023
<i>The box has been hidden away for centuries,</i>

279
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,525
<i>lost In time, never meant to be discovered.</i>

280
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,653
<i>If he thinks he has found Its location,</i>

281
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:28,325
<i>then you are heading towards
truly treacherous waters, my friend.</i>

282
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,789
- It's a boy.
- No.

283
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,792
It's a boy.

284
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:44,341
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Prince Regent Hotel...

285
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,687
Excuse me, sir. I'll be working at the hotel.

286
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,856
Isn't everyone?

287
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,795
Over there, sir. Thank you.
Very good morning.

288
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,397
Did you lose your parents, lad?

289
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,733
I have my letters of introduction.

290
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,111
- I'm here to work as a porter.
- Porter?

291
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,946
Servants' entrance is in the back.

292
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,709
Who is this?

293
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,586
I apologize, madame. New porter.

294
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,797
Snuck his way into the lobby.

295
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,428
Too bad.

296
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,388
Too...

297
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:14,848
Bad.

298
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:21,771
Come with me.

299
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:33,450
As manager of this hotel,
I run a tight and efficient machine.

300
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,453
Number one rule,
staff should be invisible and silent.

301
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,622
And this is what we're famous for.
Our therapeutic baths.

302
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:43,752
Many of our guests travel from far and wide
to bathe in our healing waters.

303
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,839
People arrive in wheelchairs
and leave riding bicycles.

304
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,091
And they pay handsomely for it.

305
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,137
Kitchens.

306
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,473
Keep up.

307
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,022
Your quarters are <i>up</i> these stairs,
top of the building.

308
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,274
And this is where I leave you.

309
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,820
Uniform for the new porter.

310
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,374
Stand over there, please.

311
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,930
May I ask you, have you seen a boy?

312
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,808
- A boy?
- Yes.

313
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,685
- He's 10, goes by the name of Felix.
- Shh. Quiet.

314
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,188
I don't want no trouble.

315
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,690
Then you've seen him?

316
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,277
There aren't any boys
younger than you in this hotel.

317
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,696
Or this town.

318
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,991
I'm not a boy.

319
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,161
Well, you're not a man, either.

320
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,582
All I can say is, do not walk the
grounds of this hotel at night.

321
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,501
Unless you want to be snatched.

322
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,422
Sacha.

323
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,550
Name's Sacha.

324
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:32,212
- How are we doing?
- The hotel's almost at capacity.

325
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,256
Good. The more money you make me,

326
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,091
the quicker I can find what I'm looking for.

327
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,180
You're late for inspection.

328
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,830
New boy. Too big.

329
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,833
Oh, shame.

330
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:13,711
All right.

331
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:15,755
Get back to work.

332
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,193
Good morning, ma'am.

333
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,820
This way, sir.

334
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,364
Sorry, we're all full.

335
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,825
Best use the stairs.

336
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,840
Oh! What have you done, puppy?

337
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,174
Oh...

338
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,592
There, there.

339
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,397
I really... I didn't mean to.

340
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,441
Where have you been, girl? You're late!

341
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,152
I told ya I wanted you home before nightfall.

342
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,404
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Come on!

343
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,532
You want to be snatched by the beast like
all the other children, do ya?

344
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:25,867
Hurry up!

345
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:13,623
You do as you're told!

346
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,957
Get me that bottle!

347
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,437
What's this rubbish, girl?

348
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,232
I told you, Father.

349
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,776
I don't feel comfortable stealing for you.

350
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,571
You prefer to serve me this tripe?

351
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:47,990
No, Father.

352
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,118
After all I've done for you, girl.

353
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:51,577
I'm sorry, Father.

354
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:55,039
Sorry, are you?
If you're so sorry, then you can eat it.

355
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:00,878
Clean <i>up</i> that mess.

356
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,679
Who's out there?

357
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,767
What the hell's going on here?

358
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,602
Whose bike is this?

359
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,774
Father, come inside.
You'll catch a chill.

360
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,994
What are you doing here, boy?

361
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,247
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

362
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,877
Why did you follow me here?

363
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,212
I need your help.

364
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,381
Why my help?

365
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,883
You know what goes on <i>up</i> there.

366
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,177
You must know about Otto Luger.

367
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,680
What quarrel would you have
with the likes of Mr. Luger?

368
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,265
Two men work for him.

369
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:58,561
One short with a scar on his cheek,
and the other tall and thin.

370
00:32:58,853 --> 00:32:59,896
Have you seen them?

371
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,732
They took my parents and my brother.

372
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,489
Look, I can't lose my job, see.

373
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,866
It's all we have.

374
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,784
I don't think you understand.

375
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,953
The reason why Luger bought the hotel

376
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,206
is because of something called
the Midas Box.

377
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,375
It's somewhere in or around
the Prince Regent Hotel.

378
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,419
I don't know what
it's got to do with my family,

379
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,046
but there must be a connection.

380
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,381
Some fanciful stories
you've been telling yourself.

381
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,176
Sounds like a lot of nonsense.

382
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,511
What if it's not?

383
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:35,640
A creation so powerful
that it can turn any object to gold.

384
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:36,974
Where are you, girl?

385
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:38,976
It's time you left.

386
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,646
I'm sorry, I can't help
with whatever row you have.

387
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,569
Just...

388
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:51,072
Don't stray from the path.

389
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,515
Faithfulness will be your shield,

390
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,684
as a thousand may fall and hide,

391
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:05,021
but no evil shall ever
come near you with gold at your side.

392
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,090
Stop bringing that up, would ya?

393
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,516
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take care!

394
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,519
Coming, start now. Let my friend here...

395
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,396
Finally, something we can work with.

396
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,731
The very best.

397
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,068
Brought in special from Switzerland.

398
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,363
We need to double
the excavation efforts and get that box

399
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,865
so we can get oft this godforsaken island.

400
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,749
Excuse me, sir. I'm very sorry.

401
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:09,210
Never be sorry, my boy.

402
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,921
It will only force you into debt.

403
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:15,716
Well, we've arranged the best room for you.

404
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:19,011
On a clear day,
you can see the windmills of Holland.

405
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,847
Holland.

406
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:25,434
The land of tulips, clogs and cheese.

407
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,479
All things that terrify me.

408
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,398
Especially cheese.

409
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,400
The Great Bizmillah.

410
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,987
So glad you finally decided to show up.

411
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:39,073
<i>We</i> were expecting you, um...

412
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,450
Oh!  A week ago.

413
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:44,954
I was delayed by the Emperor of China.

414
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,665
Well, your reputation certainly precedes you,

415
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:51,085
let <i>us</i> hope that you're
as good as they say you are.

416
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:52,878
And what do they say?

417
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,297
That few magicians are your better.

418
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,675
As magicians go.

419
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,678
That depends on how well you pay, sir.

420
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,680
If you give me a show I won't ever forget,

421
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,849
you will be amply rewarded.

422
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,225
That I can do.

423
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:12,481
I can't express what a challenge it will
be for you to amaze me.

424
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:15,359
I'm addicted to the magical arts.

425
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,278
It's my religion.

426
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,321
Well, then, let <i>us</i> pray together.

427
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:24,952
Addictions can be a very corruptive path.

428
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,247
A man can lose his soul.

429
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,167
Or gain it.

430
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,544
Depends on your point of view.

431
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:50,728
Mariah.

432
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:58,819
Where have you been, boy?
Bags! Bags! Bags!

433
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,572
I'll take that.

434
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:03,949
Thank you.

435
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,788
Has anyone seen the new porter boy?

436
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,713
Mariah. Quickly, this way.

437
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,507
Sacha, are you all right?

438
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,008
Shh!

439
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:29,225
I knew if they saw you
you'd be in great peril.

440
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:31,936
Then you believe me?

441
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,897
I believe that ever since
Mr. Luger bought this hotel

442
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,358
there's been horrible
and strange happenings.

443
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,069
Does this mean you're going to help me?

444
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,575
You see how the water
comes <i>up</i> from underground.

445
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,703
The stream had run dry many years ago,

446
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,832
until Mr. Luger
bought the hotel and reopened the baths.

447
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,336
Are you all right, sir?

448
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,256
He's been making a mint.

449
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,925
Charging folks a small fortune for the favor.

450
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:07,429
What's this?

451
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,431
Your Midas Box.

452
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,394
Where does the water come from?

453
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,693
Mr. Luger put this in
when he bought the hotel.

454
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,362
Top of the line. Very expensive.

455
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,948
It runs the water and powers the elevator.

456
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:30,953
Pretty large engine.

457
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,914
What else does it power?
Is there a way down?

458
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,751
Through there. That's strictly forbidden.

459
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:44,633
Are you coming?

460
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,425
What is this?

461
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,930
I think it's an old Roman bath.

462
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,518
Look here.

463
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:39,355
It's some kind of an inscription.

464
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:45,945
This says <i>auri.</i>

465
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,030
It's Latin for gold.

466
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,158
So you can read Latin, Mariah Mundi?

467
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,868
I can do a lot more than just carry bags.

468
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,288
What else does it say?

469
00:40:58,374 --> 00:40:59,875
"This is the place

470
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,836
of the water of the Gods.

471
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:06,632
Sacred spring of healing gold."

472
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,595
Alchemists through time believed that gold
could heal all kinds of ailments.

473
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:16,225
What if the underground stream
was running over the box somewhere?

474
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,895
- You said that the box turns...
- To gold. I know.

475
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,983
What if they're wrong
and the box doesn't turn things to gold?

476
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:26,944
It does something far more powerful.

477
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,072
It heals people.

478
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,744
Quickly.

479
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,610
She's locked <i>us</i> in.

480
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,574
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- Shh!

481
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,995
Can you hear that?

482
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:26,962
It's the sea.

483
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:38,474
Do you recognize him?

484
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:41,769
Recognize? What's left to recognize?

485
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,193
Looks like he was stabbed.

486
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:07,795
You fool!
Don't you think we've had enough scares?

487
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,764
"Charles Pinworth, Owner and Manager
of the Prince Regent Hotel."

488
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:20,516
I knew it.

489
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,892
When Luger bought the hotel

490
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,269
we were told that Mr. Pinworth
went to Africa to retire.

491
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,855
But he left without saying
goodbye to anyone.

492
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:31,110
Some thought it was because he was
too sad, but this means that he was...

493
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:32,361
Murdered.

494
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,866
This is horrible.

495
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,577
I can't breathe. I have to get out of here.

496
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,704
Sacha, no!

497
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:54,591
- That's just great.
- So, it's my fault, is it?

498
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:55,884
I knew
I shouldn't have come with you.

499
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:56,969
You're the one who panicked!

500
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,179
You're the one
digging into things you shouldn't be.

501
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:01,515
Bringing all kinds of pandemonium our way.

502
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,851
This is murder we're talking about, Sacha!

503
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:05,394
I know that.

504
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:07,396
And I want nothing to do with it.

505
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,189
Nothing at all!

506
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,586
What is the meaning of this, boy?

507
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:33,297
I, uh... I think...

508
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,424
I think the tank

509
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,342
is holding, boy!

510
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,596
Oh!

511
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:44,933
Excuse me.

512
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:50,063
You must be the mistress of this domicile.

513
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:53,400
I am the Great Bizmillah.

514
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:54,943
I know who you are.

515
00:44:55,569 --> 00:45:00,657
Why a man such as Luger
would waste time on such infantile trickery

516
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,409
is beside me.

517
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:06,038
You don't believe in magic, hmm?

518
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,040
I make my own magic.

519
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:10,626
Mr. Luger is simply a man obsessed.

520
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:14,129
Who knows the dark secrets

521
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:17,966
of a man's cravings, hmm?

522
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,594
Who cares?

523
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:21,970
Ha...

524
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,431
Apologies for the mess.

525
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:26,475
The lad and I were practicing

526
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:30,395
my escape from the water chamber of death.

527
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:36,401
Well, then, back to the
thaumaturgy and ensorcellment.

528
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:38,904
Let the show begin!

529
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:50,666
Salt.

530
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,710
Ladies and gentlemen,

531
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:58,674
it is with great pleasure
the Prince Regent presents

532
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:02,386
the Great Bizmillah!

533
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:13,563
Welcome,

534
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:18,360
to this night of magic and prestidigitation.

535
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:23,573
Some of you will be horrified,

536
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:27,035
some mesmerized,

537
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:31,456
and some simply astounded!

538
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:35,043
Now, as you see,

539
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:38,338
chains are hard enough to escape

540
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:42,968
and water  suffocates the breath.

541
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,721
And from this chamber

542
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,348
there is no escape.

543
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,728
Now, I need an able volunteer

544
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:56,606
to count my time in this chamber.

545
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,736
You, sir, please.

546
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:03,822
Take hold of this pocket watch.

547
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:09,536
I am unable to hold my breath
for longer than two minutes.

548
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,955
Is that understood, sir?

549
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,333
Very well.

550
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:41,276
Thirty seconds.

551
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,578
Sixty.

552
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:02,130
Ninety.

553
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:10,806
Good God, man,
let him out or he'll surely drown!

554
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:13,183
Don't just stand there, boy. Let him out!

555
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,353
That was a close call.

556
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,649
Close indeed!

557
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,298
Impressive show you give, sir.

558
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,217
The pleasure is yours.

559
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:51,012
What intriguing puzzles you've created.

560
00:48:52,264 --> 00:48:54,641
My mind simply cannot figure out

561
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:57,352
how you endured the swords of destiny

562
00:48:57,436 --> 00:49:00,188
and I'm a very smart man.

563
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,200
Something wrong, boy?

564
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:14,786
Sir, have some respect.

565
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,540
You know very well a magician
is sworn to secrecy.

566
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,377
I will get it out of you somehow.

567
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:26,548
- A drink perhaps.
- Oh, I'm quite exhausted.

568
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,345
Good night, gentlemen.

569
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:37,058
Good night, sir.

570
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:41,897
I would greatly appreciate if you could return
tomorrow to set <i>up</i> before the show.

571
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:43,899
- Of course.
- What is it, Mariah?

572
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:49,404
I see a search in those eyes.
Did you lose something?

573
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:53,533
Someone dear to you?

574
00:49:55,744 --> 00:49:56,745
You could say that.

575
00:49:56,828 --> 00:50:01,458
Then I suggest you stop at nothing
until you find him.

576
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,643
Can I talk to you?

577
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:21,520
- I have work to do.
- Please.

578
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:23,730
I have no one else.

579
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,696
My mother gave me this
before my parents went missing.

580
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,200
My brother was wearing its twin.

581
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,703
Yesterday I saw Luger
wearing it around his neck.

582
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:41,456
Felix is here. I know it.

583
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:43,917
Please.

584
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,294
You have to help me.

585
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,591
How?

586
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,971
The lift was installed
at the same time as the steam engine.

587
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:59,391
Luger gets in and he never gets out.

588
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:01,476
He simply just disappears.

589
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,312
- Stay here.
- Where are you going?

590
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:05,981
I have a theory.

591
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:39,055
Hello, girlie.

592
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,351
Come to admire me flex my muscles?

593
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:44,936
Not exactly.

594
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,106
Um, I was wanting to borrow your uniform.

595
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:49,858
My uniform?

596
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:55,447
Don't look so shocked. He's a pig.

597
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,531
It's not that.

598
00:51:56,573 --> 00:51:59,075
It's just I've never
knocked anyone unconscious before.

599
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:09,753
Any idea what you're doing?

600
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,339
No. Only what I've seen.

601
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,396
There's no secret floor.

602
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,904
There has to be.

603
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:38,406
Look for some kind of trigger.

604
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,582
I can't see anything.

605
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:25,829
I'd say we found Mr. Luger's office.

606
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:52,689
This is Egyptian.

607
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:54,858
I've seen this before.

608
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,371
Looks like solid gold.

609
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,500
Charlemagne's armor.

610
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:15,670
Look at this.

611
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:18,548
I can see your footprints.

612
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,850
I think I found what killed Charles Pinworth.

613
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:34,063
Kills the body, mind and soul.

614
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:37,525
You might want to see this.

615
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,452
Wherever the healing stream flows
is the box

616
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:50,663
and Luger is digging for it around the hotel.

617
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,293
Listen to this.

618
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:58,129
"Faithfulness will be your shield

619
00:54:58,213 --> 00:55:00,256
as a thousand may fall and hide

620
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,302
but no evil shall ever come near you
with gold at your side."

621
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,888
That's the last thing
my mother said to Felix and I.

622
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:12,769
"I now realize as I dig deeper
into the secrets of the box

623
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:15,230
her purpose has been mistaken."

624
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:18,775
<i>This is the true tale of King Midas.</i>

625
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,820
<i>From the time of the Sumerians</i>

626
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:27,200
<i>legend tells of a man that walked with the
power of the Gods at his side.</i>

627
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:30,036
<i>For he could heal the sick and dying.</i>

628
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:35,124
<i>When some tried to
steal his power he turned It against them.</i>

629
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:37,919
<i>Discovering the power made so strong</i>

630
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,089
<i>that no one would dare challenge him.</i>

631
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:49,430
<i>And so his gift became a curse.</i>

632
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:53,852
<i>So drunk did he become with his own power</i>

633
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:57,438
<i>that he destroyed all who stood In his path,</i>

634
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,607
<i>making himself king.</i>

635
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,193
<i>His name was Midas.</i>

636
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:07,657
<i>It is my belief that this box
does not only heal</i>

637
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:11,661
<i>but does something far more powerful.</i>

638
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:14,622
<i>It extinguishes life.</i>

639
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:20,795
No wonder everyone's looking for the box.

640
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,007
The box is a weapon.

641
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:31,472
Someone's coming. What do we do?

642
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:34,809
<i>We</i> hide.

643
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:36,436
Over there.

644
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:39,022
A coffin?

645
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:43,151
Dead outside the coffin, alive inside.
You choose.

646
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:46,404
It's a passage.

647
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:48,656
What are you waiting for?

648
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:53,036
Play your future.

649
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,382
You are to use this bill of exchange

650
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:09,510
for the purchase of the new equipment.

651
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,853
Someone has been in here.

652
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:28,363
Find them quickly.

653
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:37,246
Coming through.

654
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:43,544
Now where did they go?

655
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,892
- You blooming...
- Imbecile!

656
00:57:57,976 --> 00:58:00,103
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- Get oft.

657
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:27,714
Any sign of Gormenberg?

658
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:31,968
Oh, he's here.
He'll show himself when Luger finds the box.

659
00:58:32,135 --> 00:58:34,512
And then we steal it back.

660
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:35,930
For all of us.

661
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:39,225
From what I know Gormenberg believes
he's close to securing it.

662
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,810
And the Mundis?

663
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:43,855
The Mundis are dead.

664
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:46,399
Then we must hurry.

665
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:48,151
Position our men.

666
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,111
Tell them to be ready at my call.

667
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,950
What are you doing skulking about?

668
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,786
There have been complaints

669
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,497
that you take too long
to take the guests' bags <i>up</i> to their rooms

670
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:03,916
and that you disappear
for long stretches of time.

671
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,001
Really, miss?

672
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:07,170
Don't, "Really, miss" me.
Empty your pockets.

673
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:08,963
- But I don't...
- Empty them.

674
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:14,761
I knew it.

675
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:19,348
You will suffer greatly for this.

676
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:21,851
- You don't scare me.
- Well, I should.

677
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,480
Where is my brother Felix?

678
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:30,026
You're Mariah Mundi.

679
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,117
All the time we've been looking for you

680
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,286
and you simply came to us.

681
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:43,831
Bringing <i>us</i> what we need.

682
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,126
The boss will be very delighted,

683
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:51,839
and perhaps you can
finally join your dearly departed parents.

684
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,050
Shame, they were such lovely people.

685
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,514
Mariah, where have you been?

686
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:01,349
Did we not have an appointment?

687
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:03,434
What do you want from me?
Who are you, really?

688
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,229
Have you forgotten your partner?

689
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:22,703
- Will.
- Sorry I was late.

690
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:25,456
The real Bizmillah was a little difficult to, uh...

691
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:30,378
Detain. Quite a disguise, eh?

692
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,005
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Sorry, old boy.

693
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:36,050
Had to stay incognito,
couldn't jeopardize the mission here.

694
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:37,885
Help me. We'll hide her in the closet.

695
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,227
- But you've been here...
- I've been watching out for you all along.

696
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:50,231
What happened to my parents?

697
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:52,191
<i>We</i> suspect...

698
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:57,864
Your father's engraved wallet
was found on the banks of the Thames

699
01:00:57,905 --> 01:00:59,407
with your mother's handbag.

700
01:01:01,576 --> 01:01:02,910
Their bodies were never found.

701
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:04,996
No.

702
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:07,623
I don't care what you say, it's not true.

703
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:10,585
You have to stay focused, Mariah.
You have to be brave.

704
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,461
Luger is close to finding the box.

705
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:14,463
And what about my brother?

706
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:15,756
You find the box...

707
01:01:16,424 --> 01:01:17,592
You find your brother.

708
01:01:19,844 --> 01:01:21,637
I know what it is. It's a weapon.

709
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:22,930
I see you've been doing your homework.

710
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:24,807
A very powerful and very lethal weapon.

711
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:26,809
- You knew this all along?
- Suspected.

712
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:27,894
And why didn't you tell me?

713
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,395
If you would've known
it could have jeopardized...

714
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:31,105
The mission. Yes, I heard you the first time.

715
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:32,607
I thought we were supposed to be partners.

716
01:01:33,149 --> 01:01:34,609
Then why didn't you show me this?

717
01:01:35,026 --> 01:01:36,652
I gave this to your mother.

718
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,405
- Where's the other half?
- On Felix.

719
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:41,657
Not anymore. It's around Luger's neck.

720
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:43,284
What is it?

721
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:46,662
It's a key. A switch that turns on the weapon.

722
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:48,956
If he finds the box,

723
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:50,958
the key is all that stands in his way.

724
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:54,128
I'll steal back the other half
tonight at my show.

725
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:58,758
For safety, it's best
we always keep the amulet divided.

726
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:01,344
I'll make sure Luger's busy
while you find your brother.

727
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:03,387
But I've been searching everywhere for Felix

728
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,264
and this hotel is a maze.

729
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:07,475
Then you're going to have to use these.

730
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:16,025
These aren't just ordinary cards.

731
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:19,862
They hold the soul of a fortune teller.

732
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:23,824
A gypsy woman before she died

733
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,702
took all the power she could muster

734
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:29,956
and transferred her essence into the cards.

735
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:33,584
<i>We</i> can ask them only one question.

736
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:39,840
Once we do this, there's no going back.

737
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:43,010
I think we crossed that bridge
a long time ago.

738
01:02:48,224 --> 01:02:49,684
Show me, Panjandrum.

739
01:02:51,394 --> 01:02:52,687
Where's my brother?

740
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:55,773
In 1789,

741
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:58,317
Dr. Joseph Guillotin,

742
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:00,194
hired Tobias Schmidt

743
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:03,322
to create the first prototype of a machine

744
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:07,785
to swiftly cleave the treacherous heads

745
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:12,540
from the forsaken flesh
and bones of criminals.

746
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,420
It remains to find a volunteer

747
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:21,465
brave enough to aid me in my next,
and I might add,

748
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:24,969
potentially lethal demonstration.

749
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,056
Mr. Luger, perhaps.

750
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:32,018
Would you do me the honor?

751
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:35,062
I'm not the performer, sir.
It's what I pay you for.

752
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:38,316
People might say you are afraid

753
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,484
of <i>la guillotine francaise.</i>

754
01:03:43,738 --> 01:03:45,698
I'm afraid of nothing, sir.

755
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:49,827
Nothing's happening.

756
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:51,871
This is stupid.

757
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,247
Maybe you have to show them that

758
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:54,707
your question really matters.

759
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,419
I think the cards feed oft emotion.

760
01:03:58,586 --> 01:03:59,628
They have to feel it.

761
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,756
Know that your question really
means something to you.

762
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,260
Why is your brother missing?

763
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:13,601
I left him.

764
01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:19,607
I was supposed to protect him.

765
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:27,990
It's all my fault.

766
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:34,622
I promised my parents

767
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:37,541
that I would look after him.

768
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,900
It's amazing.

769
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:06,821
Moving pictures.

770
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:10,783
Look. The beast.

771
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:14,787
It's Felix.

772
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:19,125
<i>Mariah!</i>

773
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,251
Where is he?

774
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:23,421
Tell me where my brother is.

775
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,012
No. No, come back.

776
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:34,682
Please, come back.

777
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:40,354
Tell me, Panjandrum, where is my brother?

778
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:53,284
Tell me, where is he?

779
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:55,703
No, Mariah!

780
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:01,417
Impostor!

781
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:14,430
Don't! No, please,
you're suffocating him, stop!

782
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:16,974
Hello, Otto.

783
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:19,226
Look who it is. Will Charity.

784
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:22,730
Good heavens!

785
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:25,900
Leave him alone, stop. Let him breathe!

786
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:31,405
No!

787
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:42,208
What did you do?

788
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,504
The cards needed an emotional response.

789
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:49,798
Oh.

790
01:06:51,467 --> 01:06:53,344
I never said thank you

791
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:56,096
for helping me find my brother.

792
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,068
Make sure he's dead.

793
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,528
Sir.

794
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:15,115
Wait.

795
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,620
- Have I said something wrong?
- No.

796
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:23,374
Sacha.

797
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:25,292
I'm sorry.

798
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,461
It's not that I...

799
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:33,008
I know I've burdened you with my problems.

800
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,636
I know you have your own concerns.

801
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:37,972
I don't need your pity
if that's what you're trying to say.

802
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:39,974
Sacha, please.

803
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:42,142
Let me help you with your father.

804
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:45,938
You think you know everything,
Mariah Mundi. Well, you don't!

805
01:07:47,398 --> 01:07:49,608
He drinks to numb
the pain of my mother's death.

806
01:07:50,109 --> 01:07:52,319
And looking at me
just reminds him of his loss.

807
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:56,574
I'm sorry.

808
01:08:00,411 --> 01:08:01,745
<i>We</i> must find your brother.

809
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,775
This place scares me, Mariah.

810
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:53,088
Hello? Anybody there?

811
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:57,343
There's no one here.
Let's just go back.

812
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:04,642
Felix?

813
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,065
Felix?

814
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,609
Felix!

815
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:15,611
They'll hear us.

816
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:19,657
It's you.

817
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,326
Oh, it's really you.

818
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:31,669
It's you, it's really you.

819
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:33,253
You came.

820
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:39,593
What happened, Felix?

821
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:42,888
We're slaves. They're digging for something.

822
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:45,474
They drill these holes
and have <i>us</i> crawl inside

823
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:46,684
looking for a box.

824
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:50,437
Don't worry. We're going to free you.

825
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:51,897
All of you.

826
01:09:58,112 --> 01:09:59,405
I knew you'd find me.

827
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:01,949
I've been looking for you everywhere.

828
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:07,871
Come on. Come on!

829
01:10:09,832 --> 01:10:11,125
They're too strong.

830
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:12,835
Oh, come on.

831
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:14,336
- It won't break.
- Break!

832
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:16,130
And Ma and Papa?

833
01:10:20,718 --> 01:10:23,011
Oh, no. It's too late.

834
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:29,476
No, help me.

835
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,103
Help me! No!

836
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:32,146
I'm sorry.

837
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:37,985
Please, Mariah!

838
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,945
I promise you that I'll find you. You hear me?

839
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:45,325
Help me, please! No!

840
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:55,377
No!

841
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:57,212
Mariah!

842
01:10:57,671 --> 01:10:59,173
Mariah!

843
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:18,859
Hide!

844
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:41,715
It's not a beast.
It's some kind of drilling machine.

845
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:47,471
I'm not leaving Felix alone.

846
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,891
He's somewhere underground.
And the entrance is in the hotel.

847
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:54,394
Go to the village,
get the police and whomever you can find.

848
01:11:55,229 --> 01:11:57,022
- Good luck.
- You, too.

849
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,579
Father, it's the Prince Regent.

850
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:14,331
We've found a...

851
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:21,255
- What have you done, girl?
- She's a thief.

852
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:23,799
Aren't you, girlie?

853
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:27,344
Come on, girl! You're in a lot of trouble now!

854
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:02,421
Water of the Gods.

855
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,133
That's the symbol for water.

856
01:13:32,534 --> 01:13:35,871
Now, all of you, get back to digging!

857
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:41,501
Find me that box,
maybe you'll find your freedom.

858
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:12,157
Keep digging, you little worm.

859
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:16,787
If you'd just stop struggling,
you'd make everything so much easier.

860
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,248
Well, finally.

861
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:23,335
Their shoes match those who
ransacked your office, sir.

862
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:27,339
And the girlie was carrying these.

863
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:40,394
Stop it.

864
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:44,022
Where is Mariah Mundi?

865
01:14:48,402 --> 01:14:50,153
I don't know what you're talking about.

866
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:59,246
So much for loyalty, you little char.

867
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:12,259
No!

868
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:21,643
Come on.

869
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:25,188
Mariah, your amulet.

870
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:28,942
Come on.

871
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,118
It's getting brighter.

872
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:39,703
What does that mean?

873
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:42,956
It means that I've been
digging in the wrong place.

874
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:48,295
It appears that
when both halves of the amulet

875
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:52,049
are close to the location of
the box at the same time,

876
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:54,468
they glow.

877
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:57,345
Hence this impromptu reunion.

878
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,975
Or should I say formal introduction?

879
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:07,647
I finally know the identity of the intrepid,
but extremely irritating

880
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:09,900
Mariah Mundi.

881
01:16:11,151 --> 01:16:14,362
I applaud you,
being under my nose all the time.

882
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:37,803
So...

883
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:41,264
Let's find the box.

884
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:05,372
Gentlemen, we have work to do.

885
01:17:17,509 --> 01:17:18,885
At last.

886
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,430
All these years, I've been waiting.

887
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:30,397
Go and get the box, both of you.

888
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:35,902
Don't worry, we'll take excellent care
of your little girlfriend.

889
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,318
It's so small.

890
01:19:00,028 --> 01:19:01,446
<i>We</i> can't give it to him.

891
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:03,990
What else can we do?

892
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,660
They have Sacha.

893
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:09,663
Hurry up, I haven't got all day.

894
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,771
Let's get out of here, quickly!

895
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:40,151
Now, Mr. Cleavy, if you would, the amulet.

896
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:44,572
Felix!

897
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:46,032
Mariah!

898
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,701
Felix!

899
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:54,457
Mariah, hand me the box and I will help you.

900
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:57,585
Mariah!

901
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:58,837
Mariah!

902
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:01,298
Come out quickly, man,
there isn't much time.

903
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:02,757
Mariah!

904
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:07,721
Now give me the amulet to open the door.

905
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:14,894
Thanks, old boy, much appreciated.

906
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:18,732
No hard feelings.

907
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:20,358
No, wait!

908
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:21,735
Mariah!

909
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:24,654
Sacha, the amulet! I need the amulet!

910
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:29,576
Kill them. Kill them all.

911
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:34,581
- Help me, get me, help me!
- Felix!

912
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:35,790
Help me, Mariah!

913
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,083
Felix, hang on!

914
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,376
Help me!

915
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,964
Come back! Come back!

916
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:48,428
Hello, Otto!

917
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:50,889
Oh, you again.

918
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:53,308
Back by popular demand.

919
01:20:55,602 --> 01:20:56,895
Why don't you just die?

920
01:20:58,605 --> 01:21:01,316
Stop, nobody move!
Put your guns down.

921
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:03,610
Under the authority of
the Bureau of Antiquities,

922
01:21:04,611 --> 01:21:06,112
we're here to secure the box.

923
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:08,448
Oh, you brought some friends, how nice.

924
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:13,119
Black.

925
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:14,496
Charity.

926
01:21:14,579 --> 01:21:16,039
Hand it over, Luger.

927
01:21:16,748 --> 01:21:18,917
It'd be very poor form to shoot a little girl.

928
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:21,378
Almost as bad as hiding behind her, hmm?

929
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:24,631
To be frank, Mr. Charity,
I'm a little tired of all of this.

930
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,056
Give up, Luger!

931
01:21:33,848 --> 01:21:35,225
You're surrounded.

932
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:40,021
It's filling <i>up</i> with water. Get me out.

933
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:41,648
I'll come back.

934
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:43,942
No, what? Don't leave me!

935
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:45,860
Mariah!

936
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,991
I need those amulets.

937
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:53,076
He'll kill you.

938
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:57,163
No evil shall ever
come near you with gold at your side.

939
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:02,585
I think I know how to stop him.
How to stop the weapon.

940
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:05,171
Gold is not what the box creates.

941
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:08,007
Gold is the only shield
against the power of the box.

942
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:10,343
Help the children.

943
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:34,659
There's no place for you to go, Luger.

944
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:36,703
Oh, really?

945
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:38,455
It's over.

946
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,224
Last chance, Otto!

947
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:33,885
Sir, sir!

948
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:36,763
I have to find Sacha.

949
01:23:45,146 --> 01:23:46,439
Come on.

950
01:23:57,575 --> 01:23:58,660
Where do you think you're going?

951
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:01,079
Out of the way, miss.

952
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,331
Hush, child, no need to get excited.

953
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,376
Let her go.

954
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,503
Let her go.

955
01:24:08,586 --> 01:24:09,587
Father?

956
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:12,006
I'm sorry, Sacha.

957
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,968
I'm so sorry.

958
01:24:15,343 --> 01:24:17,470
It's time to sleep.

959
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:20,306
No!

960
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:02,348
Come on, please!

961
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:43,014
No harm shall come with gold on my side.

962
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:47,060
No harm shall come with gold on my side.

963
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:12,835
How are you doing, boy?

964
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:19,509
It's been fun,

965
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:21,803
but the fun's got to end.

966
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:24,972
Shame you won't see your parents again.

967
01:26:26,224 --> 01:26:27,433
They're alive?

968
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:29,560
- Of course they are.
- Let him go.

969
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:45,410
Will!

970
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:54,669
Didn't I kill you once already?

971
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:58,881
You're blessed with excellent aim, Otto!

972
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,721
Will!

973
01:27:54,604 --> 01:27:57,356
I really am sorry it has to end this way,
old chum.

974
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,526
In another life,

975
01:28:01,152 --> 01:28:02,445
we could have been friends.

976
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:24,383
You all right, old chap?

977
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:28,721
Splendid, sir! And don't wait for me, go!

978
01:28:33,017 --> 01:28:34,101
Felix!

979
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,407
Felix!

980
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,869
Felix! Felix! Felix!

981
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:54,372
Felix! Felix!

982
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:56,165
Felix, come on, Felix, breathe.

983
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:59,085
Come on, Felix, come on, Felix.

984
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:00,419
Felix, come on, breathe.

985
01:29:00,795 --> 01:29:03,047
Felix, come on, Felix, breathe!

986
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,925
Felix! Felix!

987
01:29:06,843 --> 01:29:09,637
Felix, come on, Felix, breathe,
you're all I have!

988
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:19,647
Oh, you're alive!

989
01:29:21,274 --> 01:29:22,441
What took you so long?

990
01:29:23,818 --> 01:29:25,069
Where should I start?

991
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:28,614
I knew you'd come.

992
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,411
That's what big brothers are for, right?

993
01:29:39,876 --> 01:29:42,420
You're going to spend
the rest of your life behind bars, Mr. Grimm.

994
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:18,164
There is nothing more valuable
than human life.

995
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:22,919
And your actions have protected that in more
ways than you can know.

996
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:26,380
You've made your parents very proud.

997
01:30:30,343 --> 01:30:33,471
For this and for your services to Her Majesty.

998
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:38,684
The Bureau of Antiquities is very grateful.

999
01:30:45,191 --> 01:30:46,943
Does this make <i>us</i> secret agents?

1000
01:30:48,778 --> 01:30:50,696
Well, if you keep <i>up</i> with your studies and...

1001
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:53,366
The Bureau may call on your services again.

1002
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:54,825
Thank you, sir.

1003
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,754
I'm sorry for getting you
involved in all of this.

1004
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:10,633
I'm sorry for your father.

1005
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:13,469
All scars heal with time.

1006
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:17,056
Where will you go?

1007
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:18,724
Back to the island?

1008
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,267
I suppose.

1009
01:31:20,643 --> 01:31:21,811
Where else?

1010
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,898
Do you think, maybe,

1011
01:31:26,983 --> 01:31:28,734
you would like to come and stay with us?

1012
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:30,695
With you?

1013
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:55,761
Just a minute.

1014
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:03,686
I came to say goodbye.

1015
01:32:04,437 --> 01:32:05,646
Where are you going?

1016
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:10,443
It was Gormenberg behind all this you know.

1017
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:14,321
I suspect he knows where your parents are.

1018
01:32:14,864 --> 01:32:16,115
Can I come?

1019
01:32:18,325 --> 01:32:19,410
Not today.

1020
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:22,621
But I'll be back.

1021
01:32:28,377 --> 01:32:29,378
Captain.

1022
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:32,840
Thank you.

1023
01:32:36,552 --> 01:32:38,137
You did well, Mariah!

1024
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:40,139
Quite well.

1025
01:33:25,518 --> 01:33:27,228
Delivery, sir.

1026
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,771
Please sign.

1027
01:33:33,818 --> 01:33:35,402
Thank you, Mr. Gormenberg.

1028
01:33:44,537 --> 01:33:47,998
Hush now, my darling.
There's nothing to worry about.

1029
01:33:48,249 --> 01:33:51,377
If you hadn't given the boys the amulets,
none of this would've happened.

1030
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:55,714
I know what you're like.
You'll get yourself all excited,

1031
01:33:55,798 --> 01:33:57,675
so I think it's best if you just stay put.

1032
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:01,137
Stop looking at me like that.

1033
01:34:02,847 --> 01:34:04,890
So, I'm a bad man.

1034
01:34:06,559 --> 01:34:08,435
But I have so many plans.

1035
01:34:11,772 --> 01:34:13,524
So many things to do.
