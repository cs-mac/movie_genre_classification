00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:49,024
February 1, 2005.

4
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,551
0800 hours.

5
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,361
This begins the inquiry

6
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:56,657
into the mission herein referred to
as "Operation Provide Support."

7
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,493
Commander Axe, do you have
anything to say before we begin?

8
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:02,455
Sir, it's actually
more of a question than a statement.

9
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:03,831
Can I have a beer?

10
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,071
You may not have a beer.

11
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,795
But you may stand up
and raise your right hand.

12
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:14,801
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

13
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,710
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

14
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,373
Sir, am I on trial here?

15
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:22,433
I heard about wearing the dress whites,
we're doing the whole oath thing.

16
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,919
For now, this is not
an official legal proceeding.

17
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,313
Think of it
as an informal conversation

18
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:30,316
to sort out exactly
what happened here.

19
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,311
We've got over a dozen casualties,

20
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,696
some structures destroyed,
a few vehicles destroyed.

21
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:39,617
This little disaster is gonna take
some serious sorting out.

22
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,472
That's why I suggested the beer.

23
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,538
I'll ask you not to waste my time,
Commander Axe.

24
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,293
- Now, can we begin?
- You're the boss, sir.

25
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,669
Let's start with how you first
became involved in this operation.

26
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:54,131
That kind of depends.

27
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,383
There's kind of
the "official" beginning,

28
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,519
and then the "unofficial" beginning.

29
00:02:58,644 --> 00:02:59,938
You know what I mean?

30
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,216
Right.

31
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:05,668
This whole thing began...

32
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,620
in bed.

33
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:11,106
<i>A couple weeks back, I had just started
seeing a lady by the name of Donna.</i>

34
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,034
<i>Great girl. A lot of fun.</i>

35
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,055
<i>Thing is, we were still getting to know
each other, and it turned out,</i>

36
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,971
<i>I didn't know her
as well as I thought.</i>

37
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:19,045
Pretty good.

38
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,158
You should come by
and teach the teams a few moves.

39
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,869
You should teach my husband
a few moves.

40
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,831
Wait a second. Your husband?
You're married?

41
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,041
Don't be that way.
It's fine.

42
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:30,918
No, actually...

43
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,576
It's not fine.
I kind of have a thing about that.

44
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:34,969
He barely looks at me now.

45
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:37,383
It's like he's not even
my husband anymore. He's just...

46
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,261
Oh, my God. He's here.

47
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:41,659
What?

48
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,139
I don't understand!
He should still be in D.C.!

49
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:48,310
That's your husband?
You're married to Admiral Maitland?

50
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,268
Just go, okay?

51
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,534
Not that way!
He'll see you!

52
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,316
No! The bathroom!

53
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:00,956
It's been great.

54
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:06,397
<i>Now, as a S.E.A.L.,</i>

55
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:08,622
<i>I've been involved in evasive maneuvers,
but this...</i>

56
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,251
<i>was an unusual tactical situation.</i>

57
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:16,505
What's the matter with Buster?
He's going crazy out here.

58
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,776
I don't know.

59
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:20,801
<i>Still, same principles apply
in any hostile encounter</i>

60
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,628
<i>when you need to get out clean
without engaging the enemy,</i>

61
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,264
<i>identify an escape route...</i>

62
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,341
<i>and blend seamlessly
into the surroundings.</i>

63
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:32,229
Wait, how exactly does this relate
to the mission in question?

64
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,732
I'm getting there, sir.
This is important, I promise.

65
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,193
I don't want to hear any more of your
romantic escapades. Is there a point?

66
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,211
That night I headed out.

67
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:41,655
<i>With this type of problem,</i>

68
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,909
<i>some men will duck and cover,
others will turn to booze.</i>

69
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,910
<i>Me? Let's just say I have
my own secret weapon.</i>

70
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,457
Every time I see you,
you look different.

71
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,268
Comes with the job, Sam.

72
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,140
Nice tan, Mikey.

73
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:58,547
- Where you been?
- Someplace sunny.

74
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,741
It agrees with you,
I remember how pasty you got

75
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,885
when we were stuck
back in Poland in '92.

76
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,827
- How long you in town?
- A few days of debriefing at least.

77
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,605
We'll see.

78
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,060
Not to impose, you feel like advising
an old buddy with a sticky situation?

79
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,313
How sticky?

80
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,565
Sticky like, let's get a table
and a few more rounds.

81
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:22,780
An admiral?

82
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,115
It had to be an admiral's wife?

83
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:29,662
- What do you think I should do here?
- Go to Maitland and explain.

84
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,572
Tell him you didn't know who she was

85
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,499
until things had already
gotten out of hand.

86
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,000
In fact, call him right now.

87
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,764
Mike, that's not what I...

88
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,991
I was more looking for that super-spy
advice on how to keep this quiet.

89
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:43,044
You remember that thing in Kiev
with Misha?

90
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,348
When he sold out the wetwork
team on their way to Paris?

91
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:46,345
What that?

92
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,363
That's the kind of secret
that stays secret.

93
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:51,433
Because if it comes out,
people get sent to Siberia.

94
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,181
This will come out as soon as Maitland
looks sideways at his wife.

95
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,772
Seriously, you know,
I know you're a smart guy,

96
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,525
but you've dated, like, one lady,
and she was a frickin' psycho.

97
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,110
I'm just saying.

98
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,734
You may not be the expert
on this whole boy-girl thing.

99
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,407
My job is to know what people
are gonna do before they do it.

100
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,784
Which is how I know you're
not gonna take my advice

101
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,087
and this is gonna blow up
in your face.

102
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,213
I don't know.

103
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,968
How smart can spies be, right?

104
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,208
You're always fighting
on the side with no guns.

105
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:19,253
There are certain rewards
to fighting on the side with no guns.

106
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,787
Tell you what, one day,

107
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:24,883
you're gonna give me
some spy lessons, deal?

108
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,969
Deal.

109
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,763
I got to go.

110
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:33,143
- You gonna be all right?
- I'll be fine.

111
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,519
Thanks for the beer.
And, Sam...

112
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:37,771
be careful.

113
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:46,871
<i>I have a few more drinks
and head home,</i>

114
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:50,565
<i>figuring that maybe it's best not to get
relationship advice from a spy.</i>

115
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,954
<i>Thing is,
turned out the spy was right.</i>

116
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,593
Commander Axe?
You need to come with us.

117
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,168
Says who?

118
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,255
You were in my house
in bed with my wife!

119
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,632
And don't even try to deny it,
because I found your belt.

120
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,170
Does that look familiar?
I talked to her, she told me everything.

121
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,501
Admiral, I was unaware, sir,
that she was your significant other.

122
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:13,941
You were unaware?

123
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:15,601
You're a Navy S.E.A.L.!

124
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,444
You're trained
in battlefield awareness,

125
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,688
and you didn't see my name
on the mailbox!

126
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,857
Sir, I wasn't exactly
in that frame of mind.

127
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,652
As you can imagine,
I was otherwise occupied, sir.

128
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:26,695
I'll stop talking now, sir.

129
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,824
I checked my docket for an assignment

130
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,570
that would get you out of my sight
for the foreseeable future.

131
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,120
I think I found just the thing.

132
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,414
Not Siberia. Please.

133
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:41,713
You're going to Colombia.
Tonight.

134
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:43,737
Sir, with all due respect,

135
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,297
I'd need to pack, sir.

136
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,508
- Are you refusing orders?
- No, sir. Of course not.

137
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,241
It's been a while, sir.

138
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,460
And, of course,
for a mission in South America,

139
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,750
I should really brush up
on my Spanish.

140
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,475
You got a 12-hour plane ride.

141
00:07:58,215 --> 00:07:59,520
Brush up, <i>amigo</i>.

142
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:03,190
- "Amigo." That's "friend," right, sir?
- Get the hell out of my office!

143
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:16,637
<i>Like a good soldier, the next morning
I was up bright and early</i>

144
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,526
<i>enjoying a first-class
plane ride down to Colombia.</i>

145
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,844
What the hell
are you wearing, brother?

146
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,300
I got issued these.

147
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,848
You do know most of Colombia
is green, right?

148
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,600
I don't think the guy who issued them
wanted me to blend in.

149
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,669
Can you turn that crap off?

150
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:45,047
I was supposed to be taking Green Beret
named Donohue down on this mission.

151
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:47,907
Heard he got drunk
and set a tank on fire.

152
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:49,987
Guess you screwed up even worse?

153
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,280
It would seem so.

154
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,308
What did you do?
Must have been something crazy, man!

155
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,909
I don't want to get into it.

156
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,119
Suit yourself.

157
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,141
Good luck, big guy!

158
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,330
Thanks.

159
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:06,862
<i>I read over the mission.</i>

160
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:10,224
<i>Essentially I was going down to check
on reports of unrest in the region.</i>

161
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,059
<i>Basically, a local Colombian official</i>

162
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,735
<i>with connections in the states
called in a few favors.</i>

163
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,097
<i>He needed someone to observe
and report on a situation</i>

164
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,544
<i>so he could scare up
some U.S. military aid.</i>

165
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:23,240
<i>And I was the lucky guy who got to do
the observing and reporting.</i>

166
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,982
I read the file, I was hoping you could
fill me in the basics of the situation.

167
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,651
I was dropped into this a little...
suddenly.

168
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,912
This group, the so-called
<i>"Espada Ardiente,"</i>

169
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:35,457
has been staging serious attacks
all over this countryside.

170
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:38,419
And the situation is getting
only worse and worse.

171
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,661
We need help.

172
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,829
<i>Espada Ardiente.</i>

173
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,706
Some kind of homegrown
insurgent group?

174
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,833
Actually,
we don't know much about them.

175
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,836
There's someone
I would like you to meet.

176
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:49,713
Will you follow me, please?

177
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,383
<i>Commandante Veracruz,</i>
let me introduce Commander Axe.

178
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:55,594
It is a pleasure, Commander Axe.

179
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,639
<i>Commandante Veracruz</i> has worked
before with American soldiers.

180
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,136
He is at your disposal.

181
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:01,600
We have mutual acquaintances.

182
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,977
I trained at the school
of the Americas in '92.

183
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,146
If you trained there in '92,

184
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,899
I knew every last son of a bitch
that made you do push-ups in the mud.

185
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,109
- Vick Rayburn.
- No. You mean "The terror."

186
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,319
That's the guy.

187
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,633
So, what's the plan?

188
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:18,766
We have intelligence
that <i>Espada Ardiente</i>

189
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,961
is planning to attack
an international clinic

190
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,080
run by a group
called "Doctors For All."

191
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:27,138
- A hospital. Seriously?
- Unfortunately, yes.

192
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:29,211
They have stayed clear
of civilian targets.

193
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,255
The clinic sits in the mountains.

194
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,092
We believe the terrorists want to use it
to take control of that region.

195
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:38,078
Our plan is for you
and <i>Commandante Veracruz</i>

196
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,972
to get there before that can happen.

197
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,267
- I trust we are in good hands?
- Of course, sir.

198
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:44,434
Goodbye.

199
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,770
- Let's meet the guys.
- Fantastic.

200
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,441
<i>So it was the standard drill.
I met Veracruz's team.</i>

201
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,527
<i>And we headed out up the territory</i>

202
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,857
<i>that this</i> Espada Ardiente group
<i>was occupying.</i>

203
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,746
<i>Driving up and down mountains
and getting carsick.</i>

204
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:08,542
<i>Not much to report, at least
until we got further north</i>

205
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,544
<i>and started seeing some of the places
these guys had attacked.</i>

206
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,767
<i>It was mostly little stuff,</i>

207
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:15,850
<i>blown-up vehicles, burned campsites,</i>

208
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,752
<i>but it was enough to make me think
we needed to get to this clinic asap,</i>

209
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,240
<i>make sure nothing happened.</i>

210
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:23,824
<i>The clinic was conveniently located
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

211
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,315
<i>After our long trek there, I figured
they'd offer us a beer for our trouble.</i>

212
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,521
<i>But they weren't exactly happy
to see us.</i>

213
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,230
Okay, this is just crazy.

214
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,967
- Why would anyone attack the clinic?
- I'm sorry, doctor.

215
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,194
But our intelligence indicates
there may be an attack.

216
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,005
And so what are we supposed to do?

217
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,781
- Evacuate?
- That would be best.

218
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,491
We can give you until tomorrow to...

219
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,619
I've got people in there
too sick to move.

220
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,330
How am I supposed to evacuate...

221
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,333
Let me handle this.
American to American.

222
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:51,851
I'm Canadian.

223
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,755
North American to North American?

224
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,007
We're not trying
to bust your chops here,

225
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,217
you're not gonna help your patients
if you get shot.

226
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,672
Listen, sir, we don't have any problems
with the <i>Espada Ardiente</i>, okay?

227
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:05,466
<i>Un segundo, un segundo.</i>
Okay, please.

228
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,851
So, just tell me, how am I supposed

229
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,770
to evacuate my clinic by tomorrow?

230
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,807
Why don't you go
and take care of the patient?

231
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,221
And I've got this.

232
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,695
This way, soldier.

233
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,822
It's, "Commander," actually.

234
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:22,783
Sorry about that.

235
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,089
What's his problem?

236
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:26,328
He's a doctor.
It's his job to cure people.

237
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,914
You're a soldier.
It's your job to kill them.

238
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,500
Take a wild guess what his
problem might be, bright eyes.

239
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,997
- And you are?
- Amanda Maples.

240
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:36,880
I'm with the local food relief program.
We work out of the clinic.

241
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,333
Nice threads, by the way.
Really subtle.

242
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,843
It's a long story.

243
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,428
You talk to your buddy in there?
You guys could be in danger.

244
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,617
I'll do my best.

245
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:48,100
For now, though, we'd all really
appreciate it if you'd get lost.

246
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:49,976
If we weren't a target before,

247
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,104
we definitely will be
if you guys don't leave.

248
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,980
As a soldier, I can't just leave.

249
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,340
Sure you can.

250
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:57,046
You just get in the truck.

251
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:58,360
And you turn the key,

252
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,196
you put your foot on the pedal,
it's on the floor, and you go.

253
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:19,276
What's going on?
Who's the kid?

254
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,103
She may be with one
of the terrorists.

255
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:23,218
We caught her sneaking
into one of the trucks.

256
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,436
Everybody just calm down here.

257
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,915
Geez. Okay.

258
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:29,224
So, kid...

259
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:37,609
Okay, guys.

260
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,110
She's just looking for something
to eat. Let's not go crazy.

261
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:42,727
It's not our mission to rough up
hungry teenagers?

262
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:43,857
No. Of course.

263
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:48,827
Here you go, kid.

264
00:13:54,328 --> 00:13:57,571
I talked to the doctor
and the lady from the food-aid program,

265
00:13:57,696 --> 00:13:59,533
but they don't know anything
about an attack.

266
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:02,841
All I got out of them
was a polite invitation to screw off.

267
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:04,810
We will make camp nearby.

268
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,261
If there is an attack,
we will be ready.

269
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,287
<i>Veracruz's camp was pretty remote.</i>

270
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:22,271
<i>But let me tell you, his guys
were seriously well-armed.</i>

271
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,447
<i>I didn't know exactly
who we were up against yet,</i>

272
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,922
<i>but they had enough firepower
to wipe them off the map.</i>

273
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:31,201
<i>So I decided I'd just keep
my head down, do my job,</i>

274
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,997
<i>and make my reports to H.Q.
Like a good boy.</i>

275
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,339
Commander Axe
for Admiral Maitland, please.

276
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,959
Yes, sir, no contact
with any terrorists yet, sir.

277
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,794
We're a couple of miles
from the clinic.

278
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,761
<i>Good. Carry on as long as it takes.</i>

279
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,224
Sir, what exactly does
"as long as it takes" mean?

280
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:53,868
It means

281
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,270
"next time, stay away from the wives
of ranking officers."

282
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,857
- See you in a few months.
- Roger that.

283
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,817
Just calling to command.

284
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,987
Fantastic. Perhaps you would
like to relax, eat some supper?

285
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,157
- We are going to scout the area.
- I'll go with you.

286
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,618
Actually, <i>señor</i>, it is better
if you stay here.

287
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,775
Stay here?

288
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,914
I can't exactly observe and report
from the inside of my tent, can I?

289
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,749
I can handle a little night scouting?

290
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,459
I'm sure you can, Commander Axe.

291
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,670
But I am responsible for your safety.

292
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:25,799
If we make contact with the terrorists,
we will come for you immediately.

293
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,075
<i>This is where things
kind of started to go sideways.</i>

294
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,601
Mark that down in your notes.

295
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,019
"Things went sideways."

296
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,604
What did you do?

297
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:43,071
I guess you could say
I modified my orders.

298
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:53,952
<i>Señor...</i>

299
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,303
<i>Buenos noches.</i>

300
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:14,622
<i>So I decided to conduct
a scout of my own.</i>

301
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,317
<i>I did a basic perimeter check.</i>

302
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:31,662
<i>Searched for tire tracks,
signs of activity.</i>

303
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,791
<i>The only hostile forces I found was
a nest of spiders as big as quarters.</i>

304
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,810
<i>And in the middle of fighting
those little bastards off,</i>

305
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:40,057
<i>I hear voices.</i>

306
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:47,681
<i>I go in, check it out,</i>

307
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,836
<i>thinking maybe it was
the</i> Espada Ardiente <i>guys.</i>

308
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:51,301
<i>But what do I find instead?</i>

309
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:55,543
<i>Veracruz, unloading a bunch of weapons
from a hidey-hole in the mountain.</i>

310
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,407
<i>I listen in on their conversation,
and guess what I hear...</i>

311
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:01,519
<i>they're planning on attacking
the clinic themselves</i>

312
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,590
<i>and making it look
like the rebels did it.</i>

313
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,231
<i>And after I make my report...</i>

314
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,151
We destroy the clinic then shoot
the American in the head.

315
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:11,929
Son of a bitch.

316
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>I bet lots of stuff
go bad in an operations.</i>

317
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,861
<i>But finding out
I was supposed to get killed</i>

318
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:21,167
<i>as part of a plot
to get U.S. military aid?</i>

319
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,402
<i>That was a new one.</i>

320
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:23,875
<i>So I just stayed calm</i>

321
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,312
<i>and made my way back to camp
as efficiently as possible.</i>

322
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:27,796
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

323
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,507
Let's go back, here.
I'm confused.

324
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:34,386
You're saying you did not make contact
with <i>Espada Ardiente</i> at this point?

325
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,829
- Our reports indicate...
- Where did you get the reports?

326
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,640
From Veracruz's paramilitaries?

327
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,475
You think they were gonna announce

328
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,228
that they were officially planning
on putting two in my head?

329
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,397
What I really want to hear
about is how

330
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,732
you were kidnapped
by terrorist forces.

331
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:52,448
That's not entirely accurate.

332
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:57,450
<i>See, I couldn't let Veracruz know
that I was onto him.</i>

333
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,912
<i>So I put together a little kidnapping
scene for them to find</i>

334
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,685
<i>and double-timed it
back to the clinic.</i>

335
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,295
Man, what the hell
are you doing down here?

336
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,510
It's 5:00 a.m.

337
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,637
You and me need to talk.
Now.

338
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,516
Okay, so, I'm confused here.

339
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,728
Why would anybody want to attack us?

340
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:25,979
Because it's a ploy.

341
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:30,300
If they can make this terrorist group
look like they massacred a clinic,

342
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,194
Veracruz can do anything he wants
and get a blank check to do it.

343
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,982
Right, but here's the thing...
we're not political. Okay?

344
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:38,950
I've never even heard of the es...

345
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,160
<i>Espada Ardiente.</i>

346
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,633
It happens all the time.

347
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,209
I saw it when I worked in Africa.
Some military group needs aid,

348
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:48,376
so they do something really terrible
and blame it on their enemies.

349
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:54,473
The point is, you guys
got to move fast, okay?

350
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:56,009
I need your sat phone.

351
00:18:57,926 --> 00:18:59,971
Yeah, okay.
Good luck there.

352
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,640
To make a call,
we have to go to Santa Marta.

353
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,476
Seriously?
You got nothing?

354
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,603
We're not the Mayo Clinic.

355
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,439
And quick question: how do you propose
that we get out of here?

356
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,398
On our Medevac helicopter?

357
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:13,107
Or our fleet of ambulances?

358
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,278
We are a tiny clinic
in the mountains.

359
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,031
I'm not the one you're fighting here.
I'm trying to lay it out for you.

360
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,790
And we appreciate it.

361
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:24,120
But this Veracruz is looking for you,
and we can't have him finding you here.

362
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,291
So... just go.
We can take care of ourselves.

363
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:43,631
He must have been kidnapped.

364
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,560
- Did you hear anything?
- Nothing.

365
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,439
- Sorry, Commander.
- It's okay.

366
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,898
You still have an important role to this
mission, <i>señor Garcia</i>.

367
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:55,039
When I tell the Americans what happened,
I will say you bravely tried

368
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:56,735
to fight off the <i>Espada Ardiente.</i>

369
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:58,642
But sadly...

370
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,490
You were killed.

371
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:08,165
Throw his body in the ravine
and take pictures for the report.

372
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,459
And the clinic?

373
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,459
With the American gone,
there's no use waiting.

374
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,788
We will destroy the clinic
ourselves and make the report.

375
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,894
<i>The bad news was Veracruz
was making his move early.</i>

376
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:20,103
<i>A fact I learned when I ran into
a familiar face on the road.</i>

377
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,970
Jesus, what!

378
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,515
You're the kid from earlier?
The food thief?

379
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,996
- What the hell are you doing back here?
- I'm trying to get people out clinic.

380
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,230
Slow down.
Since when do you speak English?

381
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,731
I used to watch "Full House."

382
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:36,359
You know, Veracruz is coming!
We have to go!

383
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,028
- How do you know he's coming?
- I was watching his camp.

384
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,574
- You were spying on his camp.
- I was trying to steal food.

385
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,199
They caught me, and then I tried again.
What do you care?

386
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:47,412
Veracruz shot one of his men
for letting you escape!

387
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,378
He's on his way here now!

388
00:20:56,536 --> 00:20:58,464
- Not you again.
- I thought I told you to go.

389
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:02,051
I remember. I got a new plan.
We're gonna get everybody out of here.

390
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,804
Commander,
can you slow down and then explain?

391
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,456
This is not the time to slow down.

392
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:10,268
Veracruz's men are on their way here.
With these roads, we got about 30 min.

393
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,863
Can you be a sweetheart?
Grab these oxygen tanks.

394
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,148
You said that Veracruz
wasn't coming until later.

395
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,422
He changed his mind.

396
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:18,997
- Funny how that happens.
- What are y'all doing with my stuff?

397
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:23,156
Do you have a secret cache of weapons
around here that I don't know about?

398
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,762
I don't have a cache of weapons.

399
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:26,034
I didn't think so.

400
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,702
Here you go, kiddo.

401
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,607
Between these tanks
and the fuel out back,

402
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:32,665
we should have enough
to blow the place.

403
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,834
What?

404
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:36,586
You're not going
to destroy the clinic!

405
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,838
Isn't Veracruz coming
to do the same exact thing?

406
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,008
Veracruz wants to destroy the clinic
with the people inside.

407
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,949
I want to destroy the clinic to create
a distraction to save the people.

408
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,439
Little bit of a difference.

409
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,979
You can't do this.

410
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:49,682
Guys, you can't really believe

411
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,339
that Veracruz's guys
are not gonna see everybody leaving?

412
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:54,020
We got to cover our tracks.

413
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,647
He's right. It's the best way.

414
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:58,066
See? The teenage thief girl
agrees with me.

415
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:00,652
Now, boys and girls,
this is happening.

416
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,363
You stay here, you die.
You come with me...

417
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:06,199
- We live?
- The odds are a little better.

418
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:09,285
Let's do this. Get the patients outside,
load them in the trucks,

419
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,595
and let me know
if you see any bad guys.

420
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:14,287
I can't believe we're doing this.

421
00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:17,433
- What about me?
- You and me are gonna build a bomb.

422
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,757
We're gonna build a bomb.

423
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,675
We got diesel, oxygen,
propane out back...

424
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:26,678
- The whatch ama call it
- That's my defibrillator.

425
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,930
You wouldn't happen to have
any nitrous oxide?

426
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:31,990
We are a bush hospital.
Not a suburban dentist's office.

427
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:34,435
- What am I supposed to be doing here?
- Hold on.

428
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,480
Great. Take that.
This is your detonator.

429
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:41,108
That's gonna go.
Tape that right on top of that valve.

430
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,154
Real quick, the warning label
says "keep away"

431
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,940
That's right.
We're building a bomb.

432
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,117
You do the opposite
of what the warning label says.

433
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:05,800
My God. She ran off,
and she won't stop crying.

434
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,313
Sister. Easy, now.

435
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,306
I'm not an expert here, I don't think
that's how you get a kid to stop crying.

436
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,530
<i>Sí.</i> Blech!

437
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:36,607
<i>Rápido, por favor.</i>

438
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:38,374
Easy-peasy.

439
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:52,138
Let's get the hell out of here.
You set up everything like I told you?

440
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,767
I did I set my tank by the support beam
at the front just like you said.

441
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,972
Are you sure?
We can only push this button once.

442
00:23:58,097 --> 00:23:59,595
I'm not sure if I got it right.

443
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,062
How am I supposed to
know if I got it right?

444
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,857
People, the second I hit this,
that thing goes,

445
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:07,820
we got to be on the move.

446
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,459
It's the smoke and the fire
that's gonna cover our escape.

447
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,624
Okay.
Here goes nothing.

448
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,308
- I didn't mean it that way.
- New plan.

449
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:25,046
I got to trigger it manually.

450
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,392
Manually?

451
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,619
- Wait.
- Stay in the truck!

452
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:30,134
Maybe I can fix it.

453
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:49,862
I guess you fixed it.

454
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,746
- What the hell did you do?
- I maximized the pressure.

455
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,001
Because you told me
to maximize the pressure!

456
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,584
I just didn't know you were
gonna do it so well. You got talent.

457
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,587
Wait a minute. We're safe, then.

458
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:08,954
We're a long way from safe.

459
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,224
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

460
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,811
Sir, do you know that they
locked me in my room last night?

461
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,273
This is starting to feel less and less
like an "informal conversation."

462
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,178
Still just an inquiry, Commander.

463
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,653
Although after yesterday's testimony,
I wouldn't make any travel plans.

464
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,398
Thanks for the heads-up.

465
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,234
Now, amidst all the tales
of your heroics,

466
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,809
we seem to have lost sight
of your initial mission,

467
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:40,621
which is gathering intel

468
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,111
on a terrorist organization
known as "Espada Ardiente."

469
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,512
Right.
I was just getting to that, actually.

470
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,286
<i>After the...</i>

471
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:51,376
<i>unfortunate sacrifice of the clinic,</i>

472
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,511
<i>we all regrouped
a few miles up the road.</i>

473
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:55,612
They're not after us just yet.

474
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:57,740
I'm guessing that by the time
they sort things out,

475
00:25:57,865 --> 00:25:59,891
we're gonna have
about an hour head start.

476
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,060
An hour?

477
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,227
All of that back there
bought us an hour?

478
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,272
- Is that supposed to be good news?
- I don't know what to tell you.

479
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,228
It's better than a minute,
worse than a day.

480
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:10,526
We got to get
those folks someplace we can hide.

481
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:13,353
The closest town is Santa Rosa.

482
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:15,406
There's a clinic there.

483
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,168
Unfortunately, we can't go
to the nearest town that has a clinic.

484
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,203
They're looking
for a bunch of sick people.

485
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,745
They need medical attention?

486
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,085
- Why don't we just drop them off?
- As well hand them over

487
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,711
to Veracruz and save on gas.

488
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,835
- Where else can we go?
- No place else.

489
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,255
All the other so-called villages
are just a bunch of houses and a church.

490
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:33,841
I know a place.

491
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,801
A camp, nearby.

492
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,845
A camp? Whose camp?

493
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,995
<i>Espada Ardiente.</i>

494
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:43,842
Do you remember when you

495
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:46,069
were just a hungry teenager
who couldn't speak English?

496
00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:48,522
You said you'd never even heard
of the <i>Espada Ardiente.</i>

497
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:49,941
I lied.

498
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:52,610
They can help us.
They can hide the sick ones.

499
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:54,403
You know what?

500
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:57,281
I don't think
we have any other choice.

501
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,786
Looks like we're going with
little miss terrorist here.

502
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:05,456
<i>Just to clarify, Commander,</i>

503
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,751
you decided to join the group that you
were sent to Colombia to investigate?

504
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,265
"Join" is kind of a strong word, sir.

505
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,034
I mean, we were in trouble,

506
00:27:13,408 --> 00:27:15,503
and there were not a lot
of options in the area.

507
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:16,997
All right.

508
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:19,595
And this Beatriz you mention.
I have no record of her.

509
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,555
That's not surprising.
She's a kid.

510
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,016
She's a kid who led you
to a suspected terrorist camp.

511
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,474
What do you want me to say?

512
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,603
<i>I mean, she was a mystery to me, too.</i>

513
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:29,223
<i>This kid...</i>

514
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:32,702
<i>Sir, you would understand
if you met her.</i>

515
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,801
Why am I the only one
wearing a blindfold?

516
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,449
Because I don't trust you.

517
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,609
- You're a soldier.
- That's why.

518
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,373
Do your parents know that you hang out
with the <i>Espada Ardiente</i>?

519
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,522
- Don't talk about my parents!
- Okay. Easy.

520
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:52,635
You know, what I'm
trying to say is this...

521
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:56,674
Most girls your age are into, you know,
makeup and stuff, malls.

522
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,509
You see any shopping malls
around here?

523
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,344
You blindfolded me, remember?

524
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,817
There are none.
No more questions.

525
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,724
Okay, I'm not trying to pry.

526
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,335
I'm just curious
how you hooked up with these guys.

527
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:08,885
They're my friends.

528
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:14,192
How longer till we get
to your friends?

529
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,504
I got to get my hands on their
communications equipment and call in.

530
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:20,293
Uncover your eyes.

531
00:28:20,745 --> 00:28:21,747
We're here.

532
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,130
You got to be kidding.

533
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:38,248
This?

534
00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:40,384
This is the <i>Espada Ardiente</i>?

535
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:43,462
- Is there a problem?
- This is, like, 12 guys.

536
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:45,090
I was hoping for some kind of army

537
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:47,308
or something to keep us
from getting massacred.

538
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,182
- <i>Espada Ardiente</i>...
- What does it mean?

539
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:51,771
- Flaming" something or other.
- You don't understand!

540
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:54,815
"Ardiente" means fearless,
passionate.

541
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:58,361
- We burn to defeat our enemies.
- I got it. The "flaming sword."

542
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,673
What if they're small?
We can fight just as anyone!

543
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:03,916
I hate to cut
your speech short, sweetheart.

544
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:07,350
But you know what?
The size of your army matters.

545
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:09,264
It matters a lot.

546
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:12,235
You're not gonna win a war
with a flock of sheep.

547
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,988
It's firepower.

548
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:15,586
Do these guys have any equipment?

549
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,380
Men have hunting rifles.

550
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,383
- Ammunition is low...
- You're not making me feel any better.

551
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,010
- Or how experience?
- Some were in the army.

552
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,596
And our best fighter, is Luis.

553
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,847
The big guy there?

554
00:29:28,937 --> 00:29:30,184
The one next to him.

555
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:34,271
Wonderful.

556
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:37,952
These guys took out a truck

557
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,736
full of paramilitary troops?
How do you figure that?

558
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,324
Luis shot the tires out of their truck,
and it went down the hill.

559
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,952
They killed his goats!

560
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,695
His goats?
You're serious?

561
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,370
Your best fighter is a goat herder?

562
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,206
Goat herders? Really?

563
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:22,862
Is her cough back? Let me see.

564
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,908
I did a little recon,
gathered a little intel.

565
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,748
First thing, you really shouldn't
call them filthy goat herders.

566
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,121
I didn't call them filthy.

567
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,507
The only reason I called
the one guy a goat herder

568
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,668
is because he has goats
and he herds them.

569
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,224
They're farmers.

570
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,969
Anyway, seems their land is valuable

571
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:45,573
as some sort of drug transport
to the coast.

572
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:48,559
Someone paid off Veracruz
to force them out.

573
00:30:48,684 --> 00:30:50,389
They fought back,
got lucky a few times.

574
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,661
Veracruz thought they were
bigger they actually were.

575
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:54,182
Pretty much.

576
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:58,022
She's got malaria.

577
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:01,525
Without the right medicine,
she could die soon.

578
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:05,321
I'm tap-dancing as fast as I can here.
I'm trying to keep everybody breathing.

579
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,680
Me too, man.

580
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:19,960
Why your pants are blue?

581
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:21,477
The jungle is green.

582
00:31:23,523 --> 00:31:25,424
Tell the man that
I don't want to talk about it.

583
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:32,511
What's with Beatriz?

584
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,012
She seems to have...

585
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:35,351
anger issues.

586
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,979
It's par for the course when you see
your father shot in front of you.

587
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:42,405
She wandered
into the <i>Espada Ardiente</i> camp

588
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,160
the next day, and they took her in.

589
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,458
She's, what, the mascot?

590
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,088
Something like that.
One more thing.

591
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:52,813
You have a new name in camp.

592
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:54,049
<i>"La barbilla."</i>

593
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,874
What's that?

594
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:58,903
- "Barbarian" or something?
- No.

595
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:00,741
"The chin."

596
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:09,031
Doesn't make any sense.

597
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:27,319
They train every morning.
It's the same thing they do in the army.

598
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,240
I'm pretty sure in the army
they fire their guns.

599
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,616
You think that's funny?

600
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,829
- Are you laughing at them?
- I don't think that.

601
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,287
I think it's anything but.

602
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,080
Not an army.
They got no training.

603
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,894
Luis there is about 100 years old.

604
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,631
Don't even get me started
on the big guy there.

605
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:46,797
They need weapons!
And I know you can help them!

606
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,868
I saw you at clinic,
you made those explosives.

607
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:50,434
They need more than weapons.

608
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,886
Trust me, in a real fight,
these chumps would get slaughtered.

609
00:32:57,781 --> 00:32:59,603
Just having a conversation here.

610
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:00,853
Nothing to look at.

611
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,084
Everything's cool.

612
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:04,060
I'm sorry about your dad.

613
00:33:04,185 --> 00:33:06,372
I'm sure that your flaming buddies
are very brave.

614
00:33:06,497 --> 00:33:09,588
But believe me, brave guys
bleed just like everybody else.

615
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:20,498
What do you think?

616
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,916
The truth?
They need help more than we do.

617
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:25,753
What does that mean?
Are we stuck here?

618
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,673
I got to figure out to call back
my C.O., get him to shut Veracruz down.

619
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,191
We've been over this.

620
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:33,636
There isn't a phone
for 200 miles from here.

621
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,050
Veracruz has a sat phone.

622
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:37,423
Wait.
You can't go back to Veracruz.

623
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,950
Now well, why not?

624
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:40,892
I've been kidnapped
by our new friends there.

625
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:42,770
I'll just go back
and tell him I escaped.

626
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,341
And he's gonna be like,
it's so good to see you,

627
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:47,316
I hug you and shoot you in the head.

628
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,735
He needs me to help him sell the story
about the flaming sword.

629
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,626
Should be enough to call out.

630
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,909
If you're wrong?

631
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:58,287
I get shot,

632
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:01,288
and you try your luck
with the goat herders.

633
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,129
Try it!

634
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,014
Better get going.

635
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,599
I want to get to Veracruz
before he makes camp.

636
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,309
I want to ask you something.

637
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:27,564
Are you really gonna do this?
Are you really gonna go for help?

638
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:29,900
It's like I told you.

639
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,695
- I'm gonna go back, make a call...
- People say a lot of things.

640
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,657
I just got everybody out
of the clinic safe.

641
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,743
What does a guy have to do
to get some credibility around here?

642
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,964
I've been in hot spots
all over the globe.

643
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:45,040
When things first get rough,
everyone's a hero.

644
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:49,046
Then reality sets in,
and promises are broken.

645
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:53,545
And if you let these people down,

646
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:57,594
I want you to know, I will personally
find you and kick your teeth in.

647
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:03,008
Amanda, I'm not gonna
let anybody down.

648
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,163
I may get my ass shot off,

649
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:08,849
my teeth are safe.

650
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,023
Before we move on,

651
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:14,108
<i>Espada Ardiente</i>'s leadership
consisted of this man, Louis Mendez,

652
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,530
of the Colombian armed forces.

653
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:17,806
His name was Luis.

654
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:20,576
That looks like him
about 100 years ago.

655
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:22,119
Looks good in uniform.

656
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:27,791
Did you gather any more intel
on their command structure?

657
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,789
They were farmers. They didn't
have command structures. They had sheep.

658
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:32,817
Why do you think
I was going to get some help?

659
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,090
Fine.

660
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,660
We'll come back to that.

661
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:39,834
What happened after you left?

662
00:35:40,698 --> 00:35:42,568
<i>I drove back toward Veracruz.</i>

663
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:45,420
<i>I knew his team's drill well enough
to find a scout or two.</i>

664
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,644
<i>Once I got to the neighborhood,
I ditched the truck,</i>

665
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:53,697
<i>put on a little kidnapping make up.</i>

666
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,817
<i>Hoofed it until I ran into a couple
of Veracruz's scouts.</i>

667
00:36:30,794 --> 00:36:32,079
It was horrible.

668
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:35,234
They were working me over,
asking all kinds of things.

669
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,735
How did you escape?

670
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,011
I was lucky.

671
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:40,405
They only sent a couple guys
with me to <i>el baño</i>.

672
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,913
- I managed to run off.
- We searched for you everywhere.

673
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:45,410
When the terrorists blew up he clinic,
we feared the worst.

674
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,287
It was still pretty damn bad.

675
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,801
They were setting up
to give me the car-battery treatment?

676
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:52,139
- These guys are frickin' monsters!
- Yes, they are.

677
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:54,981
You see why we need your
help fighting this menace.

678
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,215
I say we track them down
and light these bastards up.

679
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,718
Excellent. Good to have you back,
Commander Axe.

680
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:12,702
<i>We need help. Okay?</i>

681
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:15,430
Okay, Commander.
I understand.

682
00:37:15,555 --> 00:37:17,495
But let me ask you this,

683
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,361
how the hell did this happen?

684
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,489
<i>You're supposed to be observing and
reporting, not starting</i> guerilla <i>war!</i>

685
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,118
I observed the sons of bitches
trying to kill me and massacre hospital,

686
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,704
<i>I'm reporting it.</i>

687
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,261
I'll make some calls.

688
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:32,416
If this is some cheap ploy
to get pulled out of there.

689
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,805
It's not about me.

690
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,472
You help these people,

691
00:37:35,597 --> 00:37:38,650
I will gladly let you kick my butt
at a time and place of your choosing.

692
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:40,841
Please, for the love of God,
I got to go.

693
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,361
The men are ready.

694
00:37:48,486 --> 00:37:50,767
We're looking the terrorists
before they have time to move.

695
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,966
Yes, we should.

696
00:37:52,091 --> 00:37:54,161
Time for a little payback,
am I right?

697
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,525
<i>This point, I was just
trying to run out the clock.</i>

698
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:01,158
<i>I had to give the guys
from the flaming sword</i>

699
00:38:01,283 --> 00:38:04,144
<i>enough time to get their truck
off the road to their camp.</i>

700
00:38:06,335 --> 00:38:08,577
<i>And I needed
to keep Veracruz's men busy</i>

701
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,252
<i>long enough for help to arrive.</i>

702
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:12,527
Pretty sure, we're going this way.

703
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,291
But, no.

704
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:16,136
That's not it.

705
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,945
<i>Perfecto! Exactamente!</i>

706
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:08,762
What is the delay?

707
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,613
I was just talking to your boys here.

708
00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:13,100
I was telling them
that the camp is pretty much up there.

709
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,420
See the tire tracks here?

710
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:19,022
- The same tread as their vehicles.
- Yes, I can see.

711
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,608
You are an excellent tracker.

712
00:39:23,075 --> 00:39:25,278
You are also an excellent liar.

713
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,324
What the hell are you doing?

714
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,483
I just spoke
with Department Governor Perez.

715
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:34,454
His men intercepted your call
an hour ago.

716
00:39:37,028 --> 00:39:38,875
I am hurt you think so little of me.

717
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:41,477
You honestly thought
I would take no precautions?

718
00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:43,647
Hey, come on.

719
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,092
Just a misunderstanding.

720
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,347
No, I don't think
it is a misunderstanding.

721
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:55,033
I think I understand very well.

722
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,396
Now...

723
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:01,648
Show me on the map.

724
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,030
Why should I?
You're gonna kill me anyway.

725
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:09,489
I might.

726
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,569
And I might not.

727
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:16,691
The question is whether
you want to die here,

728
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:18,667
or keep breathing a bit longer

729
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,168
and hope you prove useful enough
to save.

730
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:24,982
Show me where their camp is.

731
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:26,339
If you are wrong...

732
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:30,886
I'll put a bullet in your brain,
and maybe that will help you remember.

733
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,959
Come to think of it, that mountain range
does look familiar.

734
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:25,524
So, how does it feel to be saved
by filthy goat herders?

735
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,818
Well, I owe you one, kid.
Let's go.

736
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,612
No. Not until
you promise not to insult them again.

737
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:35,659
Say what?

738
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,311
- Promise.
- Oh, for God's sake. Okay, I promise.

739
00:41:38,436 --> 00:41:40,364
They're the greatest
part-time farmer army ever!

740
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:41,325
Can we go?

741
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,457
Geez!

742
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,910
- So, Veracruz saw through your plan?
- Oh, and it gets better.

743
00:42:08,437 --> 00:42:10,235
Veracruz is looking around,
and he's close.

744
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,320
He's gonna find us
within 24 hours, tops.

745
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:15,866
Okay.
So what am I supposed to do?

746
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,659
I got a house full of sick people.

747
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,828
There's a CIA outpost
about 50 miles away.

748
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:20,788
50?

749
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,417
The pilot who brought me down here
told me about it.

750
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:24,791
I think it's our best bet.

751
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,140
50 miles.
Are you on drugs?

752
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:29,296
Do they do testing for soldiers?

753
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,549
Because we can't get
all of these people 50 yards.

754
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,083
I understand that.

755
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:36,325
Kid, can I talk to you for a second?

756
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,096
What?

757
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:41,933
I want to ask you something.

758
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:44,352
How did you end up with these guys,

759
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:46,563
speaking English like you do?

760
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,039
What do you care?

761
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:49,784
Because we're in a tough spot,

762
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:52,216
and I'd like to know
who I'm dealing with.

763
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:56,759
My father was a journalist.

764
00:42:57,524 --> 00:42:59,301
From <i>El Espectador in Bogotá.</i>

765
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:03,413
He was in this area, reporting
on the situation with the farmers.

766
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:05,498
That's what got him shot?

767
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:09,956
I knew Luis from the interviews
my father did.

768
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:15,312
I didn't know where else to go

769
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,344
after my father died.

770
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,979
So Luis brought me to the camp,
and he let me stay.

771
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:24,859
I'm glad he did.

772
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:27,950
I need your help.

773
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:29,773
I got to put
this little army together.

774
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,150
But there's a problem,
those guys hate me,

775
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,141
and I speak Spanish
like a third grader.

776
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,239
But they like you, and you speak
English like a champ.

777
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,699
So...
<i>Por favor?</i>

778
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:43,988
Talk to them.

779
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,290
And if I like what you have to say,
I will translate it.

780
00:43:48,202 --> 00:43:50,781
Esteemed gentlemen
of the flaming sword...

781
00:43:50,906 --> 00:43:52,295
It's not "flaming" sword!

782
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,465
Oh, God, forget it.
Just talk. Just talk.

783
00:43:55,855 --> 00:43:58,733
I know we didn't get off
to a great start.

784
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,436
I made some mistakes.

785
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,509
You made some mistakes.

786
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,424
Then there was
the whole goat-herd business.

787
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:12,822
It's not like it didn't happen.

788
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,312
But that's behind us.

789
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,705
Now, I'm a soldier.

790
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,566
And I've got all the training
and a fistful of combat ribbons.

791
00:44:24,105 --> 00:44:25,396
But today... what?

792
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:27,505
- Stick with me.
- Okay.

793
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,418
But today I damn near
got my brains blown out.

794
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,506
And the only reason why
I'm still breathing is because of you.

795
00:44:44,444 --> 00:44:45,890
That made me realize something.

796
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,894
If we're gonna save ourselves...

797
00:44:51,186 --> 00:44:54,983
And give Veracruz the ass-whipping
he so richly deserves...

798
00:45:00,795 --> 00:45:02,098
Was that what I said?

799
00:45:03,812 --> 00:45:05,910
The point is
that we need to do it together.

800
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,290
So I'm standing here before you today

801
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,743
to ask for your help.

802
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:15,462
Now, I've got a plan,

803
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,880
but it is not gonna fly without you.

804
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,460
So I need to know right now...

805
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,096
Are you with me?

806
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:40,528
<i>Espada Ardiente.</i>

807
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,822
<i>Espada Ardiente!</i>

808
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,713
Now let's get training,
because, man, we got to get organized.

809
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:50,330
<i>Wait right there. Stop.</i>

810
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,832
You're saying that you were
training the terrorist group?

811
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:55,685
Did you train them?
Yes or no?

812
00:45:56,092 --> 00:45:58,380
Did you work with this man,
Louis Mendez?

813
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,937
Yeah, Luis was one of the guys.
He was on...

814
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:04,062
He was the senior operative
in the Colombian military in the 1980s

815
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:06,346
until he disappeared,
presumably, to start this group!

816
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:10,245
And now you're giving this man
military secrets and training?

817
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,412
All I can say, sir, is the only
secrets I gave away

818
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,295
were the secrets
of the Analee High School

819
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,855
J.V. football squad.

820
00:46:16,412 --> 00:46:18,483
Okay, guys.
Listen up and listen good.

821
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:19,901
The plans for battle.

822
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,646
This first one here
is called the nickel defense.

823
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:28,102
If things get rough,

824
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:31,079
the scouts fall back.

825
00:46:34,206 --> 00:46:37,566
This last one is called
the prevent defense.

826
00:46:39,488 --> 00:46:40,627
Why is that?

827
00:46:42,722 --> 00:46:44,399
They've all fallen back.

828
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:50,181
What's their problem?

829
00:46:50,502 --> 00:46:52,183
All of these plans
are for retreating!

830
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:56,040
- What's the plan for an attack!
- No, they don't need to know that one.

831
00:46:56,165 --> 00:46:58,313
See, we're just trying to keep them
in the game. Mondo.

832
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:00,942
You're killing me.

833
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,153
Okay, I have a plan for attack.

834
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,582
It's called the "zone blitz."

835
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,326
And it's all about disguise.
Let's hear you say it.

836
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,454
All together.
"Zone blitz!"

837
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,372
Z-zone blitz!

838
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,665
Z-zone blitz!

839
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,460
Now let's just hope to God
you never have to say those words again.

840
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:20,753
<i>Next day, we moved out
with the patients in one truck,</i>

841
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,714
<i>the flaming sword guys
packed in the others.</i>

842
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,216
<i>It was only 50 miles, but when
the whole country is a mountain,</i>

843
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:28,886
<i>miles are kind of like dog years...
every one more like seven.</i>

844
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:30,798
<i>And, of course,
there's the worst part</i>

845
00:47:30,923 --> 00:47:34,142
<i>of driving to a CIA outpost,
it's not gonna be on the map.</i>

846
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,769
Quick update, I didn't run away.

847
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,429
I went to get help.

848
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:40,845
Yes, and you almost
got yourself killed.

849
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,233
That should count double.

850
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:44,085
Why would it count double?

851
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,779
It only counts double if you actually
come back with some help.

852
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,581
If you nearly die a senseless death,
that counts as, like, half.

853
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:51,108
Okay. Half.
Thank you.

854
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:52,660
You're welcome.

855
00:47:53,994 --> 00:47:55,679
Okay, so, tell me something.

856
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:58,708
Do-gooder...
Food-aid worker...

857
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,347
I mean, why so cynical?

858
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,916
If you're asking that,
you probably haven't spent

859
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:05,715
a whole lot of time
around aid workers.

860
00:48:10,382 --> 00:48:14,100
You get into this because you want
to make the world a better place,

861
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:17,519
and it turns out that there's people
who want to make it a worse place.

862
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,563
And we're outnumbered.
By a lot.

863
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:22,106
By soldiers, you mean?

864
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:24,441
Not just soldiers.

865
00:48:24,566 --> 00:48:26,777
But usually, when there are
people are going hungry,

866
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:29,113
there's some guy with a gun
making it happen.

867
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:33,642
Speaking of hunger,
you haven't been eating.

868
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:34,619
Why is that?

869
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,496
These guys need it more than me.

870
00:48:36,861 --> 00:48:38,189
I figure it this way.

871
00:48:38,314 --> 00:48:41,025
If we make it, I got a head start on
the 10 pounds I want to lose,

872
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:44,228
and if we don't, well,
dead guys don't get hungry.

873
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:51,406
You're not like
the other soldiers I've met,

874
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:53,304
Commander Axe.
I'll give you that.

875
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:54,495
Call me Sam.

876
00:48:57,006 --> 00:48:58,007
Sam it is.

877
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,437
You want me to kiss you.

878
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,231
- And, I would love to.
- What?

879
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:04,899
It's a bad time, is all.

880
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,750
Any other time, I'd be all over it.

881
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:08,419
- Oh. <i>No comprende.</i>
- Seriously.

882
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:10,446
I was just making conversation here.

883
00:49:11,754 --> 00:49:13,414
That's what that was.

884
00:49:14,983 --> 00:49:16,227
Yeah, just drive.

885
00:49:19,428 --> 00:49:21,816
<i>For the record,
she wanted me to kiss her.</i>

886
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:23,668
<i>So, anyway, we keep going.</i>

887
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:33,053
<i>As we're getting out
of the mountains,</i>

888
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:37,181
<i>I'm getting that itchy feeling,
that just keeps getting worse.</i>

889
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,209
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

890
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,906
- This is not good.
- This is just rain.

891
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,866
It doesn't take much
to start a rock slide.

892
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:58,286
You always see fallen rocks
and trees in the road.

893
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,912
I don't see a lot of trees.

894
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,438
I just see this tree here right in the
middle of a hard-to-defend position.

895
00:50:06,563 --> 00:50:08,160
- A hard-to-def...
- Yeah.

896
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:09,213
What we do?

897
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,393
Back those trucks up
and proceed with caution.

898
00:50:11,518 --> 00:50:12,634
Oscar can clear it.

899
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:13,718
Hold on.

900
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,423
That thing don't fell by itself.

901
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:17,805
The sooner we cut the tree,
the sooner we can go.

902
00:50:19,857 --> 00:50:21,225
It's fine. It's fine.

903
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,693
<i>While they're clearing
this tree from the road,</i>

904
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,570
<i>I'm getting a real bad feeling,</i>

905
00:50:33,142 --> 00:50:35,782
<i>one of those
"too quiet, I don't like this place,</i>

906
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,157
<i>something weird is going on"
feelings.</i>

907
00:50:39,301 --> 00:50:41,871
You might want to stay here.

908
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,130
<i>Now, I know, that there's a fine line
between caution and paranoia.</i>

909
00:50:51,855 --> 00:50:53,765
<i>People tell you about
gut feelings all the time.</i>

910
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,427
<i>If you follow every gut feeling,
you never get anything done.</i>

911
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:01,901
<i>Sometimes something
feels funny for a reason.</i>

912
00:51:07,747 --> 00:51:09,475
- They know we're here.
- What?

913
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,589
They know we're here!
Prevent defense!

914
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:30,851
Luis!

915
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,389
- Help me.
- Where you going?

916
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,307
Those guys are just scouts, okay?

917
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:45,977
They're trying to keep us here
until reinforcements show up.

918
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,663
We got to block
that switchback down there...

919
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:50,948
before that.

920
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:53,148
Here they are,
right on time. Come on.

921
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:09,790
Push!

922
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,051
Push now! <i>Ivamonos!</i>

923
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,295
Very groovy! Come on, guys!

924
00:52:41,266 --> 00:52:42,722
We got to go.

925
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,423
<i>Now listen everybody.
We got lucky back there.</i>

926
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,082
Those guys got excited,

927
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:01,594
and they made a lot of mistakes,
but it's not gonna happen again.

928
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,892
We got to move,
and we got to move fast.

929
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,938
Now, if this map is not garbage,

930
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,023
we are close to a CIA outpost.

931
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:19,337
We can get there by nightfall
if we hurry.

932
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,282
Understand?

933
00:53:24,424 --> 00:53:25,691
All right, let's go.

934
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,914
Can we talk?

935
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,052
Listen, you know, about before...

936
00:53:32,177 --> 00:53:35,466
You're talking about...
I'm not talking about that, actually.

937
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:38,236
If you want to embarrass yourself
with your fantasies, knock yourself out.

938
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:41,133
What I want to know is
once we get there, what happens?

939
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,745
Maybe you haven't been paying attention.
We get there, we get help.

940
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,221
It's as simple as that.

941
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,082
Who said it was gonna be simple?

942
00:53:51,669 --> 00:53:54,695
<i>We used what head start we had,
but it was pretty slowgoing.</i>

943
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:58,239
<i>In those mountains, the good roads
are bad, and the bad roads,</i>

944
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:00,330
<i>they aren't really even roads.</i>

945
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,243
This is ridiculous.

946
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:04,355
I can't even tell which way
north is anymore.

947
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,081
- You're sure that it's here?
- It's around here somewhere.

948
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:10,185
Because there's nothing
on this map that says...

949
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,654
We are looking
for a secret intelligence facility.

950
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:15,731
They don't put them on maps.
That's how you know they're secret.

951
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:16,659
Right.

952
00:54:16,784 --> 00:54:19,928
But isn't it possible that this guy
that told you about it is wrong?

953
00:54:20,053 --> 00:54:22,174
- Because honestly...
- There it is. Right there.

954
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,998
You want to check it out,
or should we just chalk this up

955
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:28,681
to my imagination and go home?

956
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,635
But do we just knock, or is...?

957
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,970
Now you want to kiss me.

958
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,608
This isn't some kind of joke?

959
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,319
I don't joke about mass murder.
It's kind of a touchy subject with me.

960
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,446
Guys, what can we do, here?
You got any weapons?

961
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,240
- We got a couple .45s...
- You know, like, a box of ammo.

962
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,534
Other than that, we've got,
like, a lot of computers.

963
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,995
We got maps.
DVDs. Some good movies.

964
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,747
We're an observation outpost.

965
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,414
- Observing.
- Doing communications support...

966
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:57,501
Not wearing night goggles
going on raids.

967
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,546
- We're not a fortress.
- What about the antennas on the roof?

968
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:02,757
- Can you call out?
- We can do that.

969
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:05,090
Get on it. We need help right now.

970
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,762
What you got, medicine-wise?

971
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,555
We'd call that "not much."

972
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,682
Hold on. It's better than nothing.

973
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,115
I told you, man.
It's just us out here.

974
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,312
Its me, Gabe, and the donkey.

975
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,353
- Donkey?
- The burro.

976
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:20,397
We take her into town
for supplies and water,

977
00:55:20,522 --> 00:55:22,526
- but the roads around here...
- Tell me about it.

978
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,529
- This expired, like, two years ago.
- What's up?

979
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,699
- I called in to the military base.
- Are they sending anybody?

980
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,495
They need to see you, and talk to them.
The base chief needs to meet you.

981
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:36,165
I guess there's some confusion
about your situation.

982
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,335
How the hell am I supposed to get
to Santa Marta, on the burro?

983
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,962
On the chopper.
It's out back.

984
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,005
The chopper.
Why didn't you say so?

985
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,715
Now we're getting somewhere.

986
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:50,262
You really have to go?
You can't just call them?

987
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,533
They got reports that I was kidnapped,
that I was killed, that I've gone rogue.

988
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:55,559
I got to go out there
and drag them back myself.

989
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,019
Who will you bring?

990
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,094
The Colombian military's been working
with the U.S. on some anti-drug runs,

991
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:01,691
they got attack copters, troops.

992
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,652
- Veracruz will find this place soon.
- Probably sooner rather than later.

993
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,790
- That's why we got to hustle.
- Let come.

994
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:09,865
Out of the question. We got to get all
this sensitive equipment out here.

995
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,786
We're overweight as it is.

996
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:12,913
We should go.

997
00:56:16,031 --> 00:56:18,247
Listen, kid.
I'm coming back.

998
00:56:18,904 --> 00:56:20,816
I'm not gonna let you guys down.

999
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,339
How well do you know
these Colombian military folks?

1000
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,407
I've done some joint operations
with them.

1001
00:56:27,532 --> 00:56:31,149
If they can run this up the ladder,
it'd be good to get embassy involvement,

1002
00:56:31,274 --> 00:56:33,097
maybe arrange visas
for some of these folks.

1003
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,683
We call DC. There's a refugee program
be able to get them into.

1004
00:56:35,808 --> 00:56:36,976
Sounds good.

1005
00:56:47,193 --> 00:56:48,195
Here we go.

1006
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:10,843
- How long is this gonna take?
- Hard to say.

1007
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,804
As soon as we land, we'll find
the foreign affairs officer,

1008
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,570
get the ball rolling on paperwork.

1009
00:57:15,695 --> 00:57:17,266
- Paperwork?
- For going back.

1010
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,226
You know the drill
authorization reports...

1011
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,842
Duty orders.
Debriefing reports.

1012
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:22,480
You guys didn't mention

1013
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,774
anything about paperwork
when we were down on the ground.

1014
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,315
What are you talking about?

1015
00:57:26,597 --> 00:57:27,906
It's protocol, man.

1016
00:57:28,163 --> 00:57:31,530
The CIA's not gonna send out a military
tactical team without checking it out.

1017
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,783
Why they hell didn't you
mention that back there?

1018
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,409
What, cause a riot?

1019
00:57:35,946 --> 00:57:38,314
We got rules to follow,
like anybody else, pal.

1020
00:57:38,439 --> 00:57:42,039
Those rules are also pretty clear,
when a facility's been compromised,

1021
00:57:42,164 --> 00:57:44,627
you take the classified
material and bug out

1022
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,580
without causing
an international incident.

1023
00:57:46,705 --> 00:57:48,506
Keyword there would be "without."

1024
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:51,717
You were on board with all this,
especially with all that embassy talk?

1025
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:52,886
Visas.

1026
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,339
You promised those people down there.

1027
00:57:56,464 --> 00:57:58,516
- I promised those people.
- Grow up, man.

1028
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,062
No way we could have ever given them
anything near what you promised them.

1029
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,688
Not unless U.S. personnel
were under direct attack.

1030
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,528
<i>There's a point in a soldier's life</i>

1031
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,242
<i>where he's got to decide
whether he's gonna follow the letter</i>

1032
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:11,126
<i>or the spirit of his orders.</i>

1033
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:14,115
You can't do anything unless Americans
are under direct attack?

1034
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,456
That's right.

1035
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,243
What about you?
Do you count?

1036
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,453
Land the chopper. Now.

1037
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,676
You held two CIA officers hostage

1038
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,756
on behalf of a suspected
terrorist group?

1039
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,384
That's treason.

1040
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,049
Do you think I wanted to?

1041
00:58:35,406 --> 00:58:36,924
Do you think I had a choice?

1042
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,594
Sir, we were not gonna get help

1043
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,436
unless those guys told the brass
that they were under attack.

1044
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:42,852
I did what I had to do.

1045
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,426
- I see. You had to kidnap them.
- "Kidnap." Get out of here.

1046
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:46,897
I was helping them.

1047
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,097
Do the right thing.
With a .45-caliber pistol?

1048
00:58:49,222 --> 00:58:50,794
You know what they say, sir.

1049
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:53,279
Guns don't help people.
People help people.

1050
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:55,739
You are in a world of hurt, soldier.

1051
00:59:01,574 --> 00:59:02,538
Commander Axe,

1052
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,082
as we reconvene this inquiry,

1053
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:07,977
I am obliged to ask you

1054
00:59:08,102 --> 00:59:10,796
if you would like us
to assign you a military lawyer.

1055
00:59:11,412 --> 00:59:12,214
A lawyer?

1056
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,508
- I'd advise it.
- I was just making a report here.

1057
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,448
We've gone beyond that.

1058
00:59:16,573 --> 00:59:19,062
Now, we've detained
and questioned a few of the people

1059
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:21,849
that were involved
in your little adventure,

1060
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:24,018
and there's quite a case
building against you.

1061
00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:26,145
You're rounding people up?

1062
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,972
The farmers, the doctor,
Amanda Maples.

1063
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:31,442
Those are my friends, sir.
They didn't do anything wrong.

1064
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,319
It's standard operating procedure.

1065
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,863
"Standard operating procedure."
Why don't you bite me?

1066
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:39,408
- You're speaking to a superior officer!
- You're speaking to a superior officer!

1067
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,701
Stand down!

1068
00:59:41,015 --> 00:59:44,589
Now, you've underestimated
the sheer size of this fiasco.

1069
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,833
And by all accounts, you are standing
in the middle of it, dead center.

1070
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,836
Last chance, do you want to exercise
your right to legal counsel?

1071
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,507
You know what these proceedings
could result in.

1072
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,747
Me getting thrown
into a hole for the rest of my life?

1073
00:59:57,872 --> 00:59:58,677
I got it.

1074
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,805
I also know that a lawyer is not gonna
make a damn bit of difference.

1075
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,984
You want to hang
this mess around my neck,

1076
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:06,060
you go for it,
but leave my friends alone.

1077
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,864
You're in no position to negotiate,
Commander Axe.

1078
01:00:08,989 --> 01:00:10,888
Now I want to hear
about what happened

1079
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:14,902
after you drew your weapon
on two CIA field agents.

1080
01:00:15,961 --> 01:00:17,078
All right. Fine.

1081
01:00:17,203 --> 01:00:19,692
After my "conversation"
with the CIA boys,

1082
01:00:19,817 --> 01:00:21,250
we went back to the outpost.

1083
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,805
And let me tell you something...

1084
01:00:23,143 --> 01:00:24,745
<i>Everybody was real glad to see me.</i>

1085
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,677
- Change of plans.
- That was quick.

1086
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:29,792
- You know the town is the other way?
- I thought you were going to get help.

1087
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,419
- There was a little hitch.
- What kind of a hitch?

1088
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,256
Turns out our CIA buddies
were not such good buddies after all.

1089
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:37,383
They were planning on leaving
you to the wolves.

1090
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,926
I disagreed with that plan.

1091
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,555
- They are...
- Tied up in the helicopter.

1092
01:00:46,202 --> 01:00:47,282
That is not good.

1093
01:00:47,871 --> 01:00:49,982
Now what are we supposed to do?

1094
01:00:50,107 --> 01:00:52,523
Aren't you the one who said
that we were going to get slaughtered?

1095
01:00:53,812 --> 01:00:56,318
- That's not gonna happen.
- You have a plan?

1096
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,558
I know where to start.

1097
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,453
- Make the call.
- I'm not calling in.

1098
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,663
You'll thank me.

1099
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,540
I'm pretty sure we won't thank you.

1100
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,840
Yeah, you will.
Veracruz is following our trail here.

1101
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:13,441
He's gonna wipe this place

1102
01:01:13,566 --> 01:01:16,672
off the face of the earth,
and you two yahoos with it.

1103
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:18,882
What do you want?

1104
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,884
I want you to call your CIA buddies,

1105
01:01:21,107 --> 01:01:22,886
tell them to get
the military out here,

1106
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,847
the national police,
everything they got.

1107
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,589
- You're gonna burn for this.
- Yeah, but that's not the question.

1108
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,435
You're gonna make that call...

1109
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,770
Or if I'm gonna have to make you
make the call.

1110
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,614
Yeah, it's Gabriel Manaro
out at station 412.

1111
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,105
We got a situation here.

1112
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,869
Some kind of rogue military force
is attacking our position.

1113
01:01:49,537 --> 01:01:50,624
Helping you sell it.

1114
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,247
Yeah, yeah...

1115
01:01:52,372 --> 01:01:55,085
That's we're firing back at them.
We need supp...

1116
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:56,754
Be more convincing.

1117
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:59,089
Jesus! No.
No, I'm not talking to you.

1118
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,343
- We need help!
- We need support now!

1119
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,720
- Send the help!
- Military support!

1120
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:08,807
Help us!
I am at station 4-1-2!

1121
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,059
Yes! Just hurry!

1122
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,270
In three hours.

1123
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,237
Three hours?
Veracruz is just up the road.

1124
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:16,857
He's gonna be all over us.

1125
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:19,609
- They're coming from over mountains.
- That's what it takes, dude!

1126
01:02:19,734 --> 01:02:21,403
That's the fastest they can get here.

1127
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,197
What's going on?
Who's shooting?

1128
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:26,533
- That was me just making a point.
- Okay, what?

1129
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:27,701
Good and bad news.

1130
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,244
Good, help is on the way.

1131
01:02:29,563 --> 01:02:32,247
Bad news is, we're gonna have
to hold out until it gets here.

1132
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,749
Okay, <i>señors.</i>

1133
01:02:40,538 --> 01:02:41,674
Look what I made.

1134
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,182
That's a hell of a bomb.
Wow. You got a gift.

1135
01:02:44,307 --> 01:02:47,554
I've been doing field medicine
for a long time. You learn to improvise.

1136
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,705
I've known a lot of field medics,
they don't have chops with explosives.

1137
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,585
- Good work.
- Thank you.

1138
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:54,144
Where's the kid?

1139
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:02,748
Can I talk to you for a sec?

1140
01:03:02,873 --> 01:03:03,668
What?

1141
01:03:04,174 --> 01:03:05,220
You know...

1142
01:03:05,345 --> 01:03:07,983
this fight with Veracruz,
it's gonna be rough.

1143
01:03:08,108 --> 01:03:09,785
We got to hold them off
for a long time.

1144
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,393
It would be a good idea

1145
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:14,062
if you just stay back here
and watch the CIA guys.

1146
01:03:14,187 --> 01:03:16,097
Stay here?
I'm fighting with the others.

1147
01:03:16,222 --> 01:03:19,100
Okay, okay.
Just hear me out here.

1148
01:03:19,225 --> 01:03:21,703
Now, you're still young,
and you've done more in this fight

1149
01:03:21,828 --> 01:03:23,895
than any kid should ever have to.

1150
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:26,218
Those men killed my father.

1151
01:03:27,525 --> 01:03:29,505
I think it's safe to say
if your dad was here,

1152
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,319
he wouldn't want you
catching a bullet.

1153
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:32,891
What would he say?

1154
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:35,005
I don't know.

1155
01:03:36,576 --> 01:03:37,776
He's not here.

1156
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:42,205
He would say a kid as tough
and as smart as you

1157
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,092
is gonna have a big future.

1158
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:45,904
He'd want you to grow up and see it.

1159
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:49,032
He would want me to stay.

1160
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:52,035
So you'll stay?

1161
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:55,363
No.
But thanks anyways.

1162
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:58,000
You remind me of my father.

1163
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,919
And I didn't listen to him, either.

1164
01:04:03,979 --> 01:04:05,347
Kids these days.

1165
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:07,134
All right, mount up!

1166
01:04:07,697 --> 01:04:09,636
<i>We did a little recon
when we got out to the road</i>

1167
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,763
<i>and we got some more bad news.</i>

1168
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:15,924
<i>Veracruz's buddy Perez showed up,
and he brought more guys with him...</i>

1169
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:18,787
<i>A lot more guys,
with a lot more guns.</i>

1170
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,834
<i>Still, there wasn't much to do
but stick with the plan.</i>

1171
01:04:42,092 --> 01:04:44,630
<i>We had our little explosive
device cobbled together</i>

1172
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,821
<i>from some C-4 charges
the CIA guys had</i>

1173
01:04:46,946 --> 01:04:49,679
<i>in case they needed to blow up
their computers in a hurry.</i>

1174
01:04:52,171 --> 01:04:55,346
<i>The way I figured it,
if we could plant it at the right spot,</i>

1175
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:58,622
<i>we could block the road with thousand
pounds of burning truck wreckage</i>

1176
01:04:58,747 --> 01:05:00,790
<i>then pin Veracruz down for a while.</i>

1177
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,441
You should probably go.

1178
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,151
No. No. Do it.

1179
01:05:08,182 --> 01:05:11,083
<i>That is, assuming we didn't
blow ourselves up first.</i>

1180
01:05:16,435 --> 01:05:17,685
Okay. Let's go.

1181
01:05:19,065 --> 01:05:21,833
I know we were not expecting
the reinforcements.

1182
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:27,384
And the odds are, kind of against us.

1183
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:33,554
But what the hell?
You're the flaming sword, right?

1184
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:39,810
Now, look, they got to come
from down there.

1185
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:44,481
When that bomb blows, it's gonna be
our job to slow them down.

1186
01:05:46,641 --> 01:05:49,517
Because if they get through here, pbht!
We are sitting ducks.

1187
01:05:52,713 --> 01:05:53,782
Sitting ducks?

1188
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,158
It's an expression.

1189
01:05:55,381 --> 01:05:59,663
It's like ducks in a pond,
ducks in a row. It's easy...

1190
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,140
How bad is this?

1191
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,110
Maybe we had a solid chance
before that troop transport showed up.

1192
01:06:16,235 --> 01:06:17,306
But now...

1193
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,433
And how long do we have to hold them?

1194
01:06:20,175 --> 01:06:22,019
Help comes in about two hours.

1195
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:24,108
Veracruz and his men,
give or take 90 minutes,

1196
01:06:24,233 --> 01:06:26,064
we got to hold out
for about a half-hour.

1197
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:29,318
- Can we do that?
- With the terrain on our side, maybe.

1198
01:06:30,717 --> 01:06:32,696
But it's gonna be a long half-hour.

1199
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,531
But, it could be worse, right?

1200
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,769
It could be raining.
Let's do this.

1201
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:41,371
<i>Now, at this point, we didn't have
a whole lot going for us.</i>

1202
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,333
<i>On our side, we had the high ground
and the element of surprise.</i>

1203
01:06:46,534 --> 01:06:50,345
<i>On their side, they had equipment,
manpower, body armor, superior weaponry,</i>

1204
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,758
<i>radio communications,
and pretty much everything else.</i>

1205
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,496
Is he on it, or not?

1206
01:07:12,621 --> 01:07:14,434
He's not on it.
If he was on it, it would...

1207
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,036
Luis, now!

1208
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:30,921
Flaming sword!

1209
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,965
Damn right.
Flaming sword! Attack!

1210
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,384
Zone blitz!

1211
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:36,796
Zone blitz!

1212
01:07:57,282 --> 01:08:00,117
Good shot, Mondo.
Don't get cocky.

1213
01:08:28,034 --> 01:08:29,653
The men are running
out of ammunition.

1214
01:08:29,778 --> 01:08:31,429
Tell them to act
like they're shooting.

1215
01:08:31,554 --> 01:08:33,436
Just pretend
like they have ammunition.

1216
01:08:33,561 --> 01:08:34,359
What?

1217
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,569
Just do it!

1218
01:08:41,683 --> 01:08:43,691
<i>I pulled out every trick in the book.</i>

1219
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,827
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

1220
01:08:45,952 --> 01:08:48,516
<i>there's just no good substitute
for bullets.</i>

1221
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,451
Okay, I don't think
they're buying it.

1222
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:25,751
All right, game over.

1223
01:09:25,876 --> 01:09:27,757
Tell them to fall back to the trucks.

1224
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,629
Old man! Let's go!

1225
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,228
Wait.
What is he doing?

1226
01:09:54,353 --> 01:09:55,939
He's covering us.

1227
01:09:57,156 --> 01:09:58,363
Let's go. Let's go.

1228
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,413
<i>Espada Ardiente!</i>

1229
01:10:14,438 --> 01:10:15,794
- I got to go back.
- Ben.

1230
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,921
I got one more charge, just in case.

1231
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,142
We got to get him.

1232
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,358
Aren't you full of surprises.

1233
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:44,614
Oh, Jesus.
He's dead.

1234
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,287
- Are you okay?
- No! I'm shot!

1235
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,872
That's right.
Stupid question.

1236
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:54,379
Let's do it.

1237
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,714
Get him inside.

1238
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,766
Damn it.
Where the hell are they?

1239
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,954
Beatriz, they're coming.
Let's get inside.

1240
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,748
- Get off me!
- I'm begging you.

1241
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,875
They killed Luis,
and I'm going to fight them!

1242
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:39,669
I know that he meant a lot to you.

1243
01:11:40,185 --> 01:11:42,779
But he was a soldier.
He was protecting you.

1244
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:44,441
Don't make his death meaningless

1245
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,522
by standing out here
and getting yourself killed.

1246
01:11:46,647 --> 01:11:49,888
Please, if you won't go inside for me,
at least do it for the old goat herder.

1247
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:55,491
Where the hell are they?
Call them again.

1248
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:01,237
How much longer?

1249
01:12:01,362 --> 01:12:03,272
Because we're running
out of time up here.

1250
01:12:03,397 --> 01:12:05,070
It's the situation is getting urgent.

1251
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,640
Is this the station chief?

1252
01:12:06,765 --> 01:12:08,782
I got to know how much longer
this is gonna take,

1253
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,913
and your numbnuts officer here
can't tell me.

1254
01:12:11,038 --> 01:12:12,065
<i>Who is this?</i>

1255
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,233
Who is this?
Who is this!

1256
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,624
Deputy assistant intelligence
director

1257
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:18,875
Chuck Finley.

1258
01:12:19,276 --> 01:12:22,663
I'm down from NSA headquarters here
doing a random sigint check,

1259
01:12:22,788 --> 01:12:24,460
and I ran into this little disaster.

1260
01:12:24,585 --> 01:12:25,758
Where are these troops?

1261
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,384
<i>They're 10 minutes away, sir.</i>

1262
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,632
10 minutes?
This thing will be over in 5.

1263
01:12:29,757 --> 01:12:30,637
Get on it.

1264
01:12:31,997 --> 01:12:33,147
Chuck Finley?

1265
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,433
Betting on him back in the day.

1266
01:12:35,729 --> 01:12:37,411
I'm thinking it's a lucky name.

1267
01:12:38,773 --> 01:12:39,938
I guess we'll find out.

1268
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:43,301
<i>Between the flipped truck
and the firefight,</i>

1269
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:45,198
<i>we bought ourselves some time.</i>

1270
01:12:45,323 --> 01:12:48,109
<i>But it wasn't too long
before Veracruz was in position,</i>

1271
01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:50,244
<i>and we were about to get creamed.</i>

1272
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,584
Keep everybody inside.

1273
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:55,135
When the shooting starts,

1274
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,497
make sure they're away from
the windows and down low.

1275
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:22,647
I'm going out there.

1276
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:26,234
- You're what?
- I got to buy us some more time.

1277
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,362
Sam, if you go out there,
Veracruz will kill you.

1278
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,324
Maybe, but if I manage to die slowly,
that'll put you guys

1279
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:33,992
closer to getting out of here.

1280
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,411
No, no, no.
You're at least taking your gun.

1281
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:39,237
If he sees that I have a gun,
he's gonna shoot me on sight.

1282
01:13:40,127 --> 01:13:42,584
- Don't worry about it, I got an idea.
- No, no. Wait.

1283
01:13:42,863 --> 01:13:45,462
I mean, they... you can't...

1284
01:13:46,215 --> 01:13:47,464
If you just...

1285
01:13:49,098 --> 01:13:50,175
stay alive.

1286
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,531
I'll do my best.

1287
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:53,803
If we were gonna kiss,

1288
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:56,264
we should probably do it now
just in case.

1289
01:13:58,145 --> 01:13:59,642
I don't want to...

1290
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,643
That is a lot better
than a kick in the teeth.

1291
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:03,873
We need to talk.

1292
01:15:04,144 --> 01:15:06,209
What is there to talk about?

1293
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:07,805
We got a lot to talk.

1294
01:15:08,215 --> 01:15:10,380
I'm here to negotiate,
your surrender.

1295
01:15:14,162 --> 01:15:15,510
Is that supposed to be funny?

1296
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:28,273
- How long before they get here?
- I don't know.

1297
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,164
They better get here soon.

1298
01:15:36,685 --> 01:15:38,658
You just love doing that, don't you?

1299
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,493
How many are there inside?

1300
01:15:42,978 --> 01:15:45,748
- You don't know, what you're against.
- <i>Espada Ardiente.</i>

1301
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,513
It's the flaming sword.

1302
01:15:50,067 --> 01:15:52,130
Believe me, you don't want
to mess with them.

1303
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,227
- Why that?
- Because I've fought all over,

1304
01:15:54,352 --> 01:15:57,056
Afghanistan, Balkans, Southeast Asia.

1305
01:15:57,181 --> 01:15:58,720
I've never seen guys like this.

1306
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,723
I count a dozen men
with old rifle, farmers,

1307
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,107
by the look of them.

1308
01:16:04,054 --> 01:16:05,435
You think that's all we got?

1309
01:16:05,947 --> 01:16:07,312
Then what am I doing here?

1310
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,051
I'm a commander of navy S.E.A.L.S.

1311
01:16:09,176 --> 01:16:11,941
You think I'm gonna be wasting time
with a bunch of smelly farmers.

1312
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:14,903
Smelly, stinking, unwashed farmers?

1313
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,731
You boys have made
a grave miscalculation.

1314
01:16:18,952 --> 01:16:20,715
That's why I'm here
with my one-time-only,

1315
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,284
not to be repeated offer

1316
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:25,163
unconditional surrender, right now,

1317
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:27,040
and I'll let you walk away.

1318
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:31,169
You're bluffing.

1319
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,546
What is he doing?

1320
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:40,679
All right.

1321
01:16:41,923 --> 01:16:43,280
Because I am feeling...

1322
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:45,433
generous...

1323
01:16:46,263 --> 01:16:47,371
and merciful.

1324
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:50,605
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

1325
01:16:51,217 --> 01:16:53,097
Surrender right now?

1326
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,151
I'm serious.

1327
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:58,863
What is he doing?

1328
01:17:04,762 --> 01:17:08,414
I'm telling you guys,
you're just making it worse on yourself.

1329
01:17:08,856 --> 01:17:10,083
We should finish him.

1330
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,419
Let's see this flaming sword,
shall we?

1331
01:17:13,915 --> 01:17:16,214
I'm telling you guys,
you're gonna regret it.

1332
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:25,138
<i>I've heard the old saying
about soldiers praying in foxholes.</i>

1333
01:17:25,263 --> 01:17:27,308
<i>It's a natural response
when your friends are dying</i>

1334
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,769
<i>and everything you care about
is about to get destroyed.</i>

1335
01:17:30,466 --> 01:17:32,306
<i>But I got to say, in my experience,</i>

1336
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:35,004
<i>prayer is pretty iffy
as a battle plan.</i>

1337
01:17:41,946 --> 01:17:43,339
<i>I'll also say this.</i>

1338
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,785
<i>You need a miracle,
there's nothing like it.</i>

1339
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:06,628
Say hello to my friends.

1340
01:18:08,714 --> 01:18:10,949
I call them the newest members
of the flaming sword,

1341
01:18:11,074 --> 01:18:12,812
you crooked son of a bitch.

1342
01:18:57,884 --> 01:18:59,859
You guys ready to surrender now?

1343
01:19:08,835 --> 01:19:10,328
That felt good.

1344
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,982
- You gonna make it?
- I think so.

1345
01:19:44,107 --> 01:19:46,906
I got to say, if you ever reconsider
the whole medical thing,

1346
01:19:47,272 --> 01:19:48,908
you'd make a hell of a soldier.

1347
01:19:50,471 --> 01:19:52,578
All right, I'll keep that in mind.

1348
01:19:54,629 --> 01:19:56,749
Thank you for everything.

1349
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,056
Back at you, doc.

1350
01:20:01,281 --> 01:20:02,537
Help this man up.

1351
01:20:06,566 --> 01:20:08,136
What happens now?

1352
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,264
It's gonna take a while
to sort this all out.

1353
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,056
My guess is that Veracruz and Perez

1354
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:15,143
are gonna be going off the grid
for their foreseeable lifetimes.

1355
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,061
What about you?

1356
01:20:17,922 --> 01:20:19,869
I'm probably gonna get spend
some quality time

1357
01:20:19,994 --> 01:20:21,983
at the nearest
covert military facility.

1358
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:26,946
Good luck.

1359
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,701
Thanks.

1360
01:20:30,687 --> 01:20:31,784
Thanks for the kiss?

1361
01:20:32,905 --> 01:20:36,188
I know you probably only did it
because you thought I was gonna die.

1362
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,967
You need to come with us.

1363
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:00,111
<i>Señor</i> Axe...

1364
01:21:59,844 --> 01:22:01,009
And here I am.

1365
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,340
That's quite a story.

1366
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:08,289
- How does it end, sir?
- There's only one way it could end.

1367
01:22:08,762 --> 01:22:10,049
A court martial.

1368
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:13,302
There is actually, one more part
of the story you should probably hear.

1369
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:16,718
I was saving it in case you decided
to be stand-up about all this,

1370
01:22:16,843 --> 01:22:19,141
- That's not gonna happen.
- What are you talking about?

1371
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,979
Do you remember the little chat
I had with Beatriz after Luis died?

1372
01:22:24,904 --> 01:22:26,261
There's something I left out.

1373
01:22:26,386 --> 01:22:27,996
He was protecting you.

1374
01:22:28,498 --> 01:22:29,916
Don't make his death meaningless

1375
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:31,946
by staying outside
and getting yourself killed.

1376
01:22:32,816 --> 01:22:34,016
It's my fault!

1377
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,578
It's my fault, all of this.

1378
01:22:36,703 --> 01:22:39,241
<i>The first discussion
went just like I told you.</i>

1379
01:22:39,366 --> 01:22:42,240
<i>It was in the second half,
where things got really interesting.</i>

1380
01:22:43,664 --> 01:22:46,419
Don't say that.
This has nothing to do with you.

1381
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:48,379
They knew
what they were getting into.

1382
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:49,922
There's no flaming sword!

1383
01:22:50,301 --> 01:22:51,674
What are you talking about?

1384
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,826
My father interviewed Luis
for the newspaper,

1385
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:57,096
I went with him, I knew all his story

1386
01:22:57,264 --> 01:23:00,600
that he was in the army
and he went away to be a farmer.

1387
01:23:00,768 --> 01:23:02,171
After my father was killed,

1388
01:23:03,288 --> 01:23:04,656
I went back to Luis.

1389
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:08,385
I gave him the name
of <i>Espada Ardiente</i>.

1390
01:23:08,718 --> 01:23:10,359
I convinced him to fight!

1391
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,559
Wait a minute.

1392
01:23:13,824 --> 01:23:15,511
All of this was your idea?

1393
01:23:17,556 --> 01:23:18,630
Everything.

1394
01:23:21,904 --> 01:23:23,113
I should die here.

1395
01:23:27,582 --> 01:23:28,584
Now, kid...

1396
01:23:29,905 --> 01:23:30,963
This is not over.

1397
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,275
Not by a long shot.
We're gonna get through this.

1398
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,265
I've been around enough,
to know this is over.

1399
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,927
There's gonna be hell to pay.

1400
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:40,097
You want something to live for?
You want to help your friends?

1401
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,679
Because I got a job for you.

1402
01:23:42,577 --> 01:23:44,255
You any good with a camera?

1403
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,442
I figured if anybody
could get away clean

1404
01:23:47,567 --> 01:23:49,231
after that little skirmish.

1405
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:52,526
A kid with connections
at the largest newspaper in Colombia?

1406
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:55,237
That could be mighty handy.

1407
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,367
<i>I had her grab one of the cameras
from the CIA outpost</i>

1408
01:23:59,878 --> 01:24:01,911
<i>and take pictures a lot of them</i>

1409
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,789
<i>of everyone and everything.</i>

1410
01:24:14,411 --> 01:24:16,118
<i>Then get herself down to Bogotá,</i>

1411
01:24:16,243 --> 01:24:18,135
<i>and go back
to her dad's old newspaper.</i>

1412
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:29,980
<i>Once she got there,
to talk to someone she trusted</i>

1413
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:32,294
<i>about putting together
a couple of stories.</i>

1414
01:24:39,682 --> 01:24:42,368
One of these stories
should be in today's paper.

1415
01:24:42,764 --> 01:24:46,288
In fact, sir, isn't there a piece
on the front page today about Luis,

1416
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:49,500
talking about how he died
under mysterious circumstances?

1417
01:24:51,756 --> 01:24:52,909
There was.

1418
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:55,016
How interesting.

1419
01:25:00,181 --> 01:25:01,796
Why don't we all take a break?

1420
01:25:02,885 --> 01:25:03,886
Yes, sir.

1421
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:14,692
You don't really think that anyone's
gonna take this girl's word

1422
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,986
over that
of the United States military?

1423
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:20,990
The girl did have extensive access
to a covert CIA outpost, sir.

1424
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,553
Imagine what she saw
and took pictures of.

1425
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,789
What's going on there
for undercover spies

1426
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,860
get their pictures in the paper?

1427
01:25:31,304 --> 01:25:33,544
- That can't be good?
- You wouldn't dare.

1428
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:34,877
The sort of thing

1429
01:25:35,002 --> 01:25:37,532
that you don't want revealed
to the world, Admiral,

1430
01:25:37,657 --> 01:25:38,674
and it's gonna be.

1431
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,802
Things that could end
a guy's military career,

1432
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,304
I'm not talking about mine.

1433
01:25:45,022 --> 01:25:47,046
- What do you want?
- Thanks for asking.

1434
01:25:47,493 --> 01:25:49,164
First, you let my friends go.

1435
01:25:49,664 --> 01:25:51,103
Then you rebuild the clinic.

1436
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,902
The flaming sword guys
go back to their goats,

1437
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:55,816
I get an honorable discharge,

1438
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,194
and we keep our mouths shut
about this forever.

1439
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,472
In the words of my buddy Mike Westen,

1440
01:26:00,886 --> 01:26:03,199
"this is the kind of secret
that stays a secret."

1441
01:26:03,505 --> 01:26:04,492
That's blackmail.

1442
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:09,325
Actually, sir, I believe this form
of extortion is known as "graymail."

1443
01:26:09,983 --> 01:26:11,999
It's much nicer than blackmail.

1444
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,662
I believe we're done here, sir.

1445
01:26:24,909 --> 01:26:28,506
<i>Agreement between commander Sam Axe
and the United States military court.</i>

1446
01:26:28,631 --> 01:26:30,267
<i>Under the terms of this agreement,</i>

1447
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,825
<i>Commander Axe hereby agrees
not to discuss, reveal,</i>

1448
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:34,830
<i>or otherwise disclose his activities</i>

1449
01:26:34,955 --> 01:26:38,818
<i>between January 22nd and
January 31st of the year 2005.</i>

1450
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:40,736
<i>He is to receive the following</i>

1451
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,774
<i>an honorable discharge
with full pension,</i>

1452
01:26:42,899 --> 01:26:45,630
<i>a change of clothes,
first class air transport</i>

1453
01:26:45,755 --> 01:26:48,786
<i>to the city of his choosing,
and one ice-cold beer.</i>

1454
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:51,330
<i>Executed February 20, 2005,</i>

1455
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:54,691
<i>by Rear Admiral James Lawrence,
United States Navy.</i>

1456
01:26:56,309 --> 01:26:57,962
Welcome to Miami, Mr. Axe.

1457
01:26:58,436 --> 01:26:59,437
Thank you.
