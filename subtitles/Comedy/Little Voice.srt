1
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,933
LV!

2
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,833
LV, will you shut that up?

3
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:51,192
Come on, then.

4
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,472
Come on now!

5
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:41,258
LV, cool it!

6
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:49,191
Oi!

7
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:24,412
Yeah, we're late, thanks
to you and Tweetie Pie back there.

8
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:27,930
I wasn't worrying about work.
I'm worrying about Duane.
- Duane?

9
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:31,674
Aye. There's a big race today.
They start off from France at 9:00.

10
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,011
Strong winds forecast.
Don't like winds, don't Duane.

11
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,972
Duane's a pigeon, right?

12
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,719
Aye.
Where's the first call?

13
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,836
Shipley Street.
Domestic installation.

14
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:53,486
I'm nearly done.

15
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:56,849
Ooh, I'll be wired up to the world soon,
me... in touch with all parts.

16
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,212
Nearly done.
- Goodly.

17
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,214
I spend me life and me fortune
in them slot boxes. Really, I do.

18
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,413
Ooh, but them uniforms
are not very becomin'.

19
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,803
You look like you been chucked
in a tool bag, you.

20
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,755
Put me right off,
that has.

21
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,602
And I always liked a man in a uniform, me.

22
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:18,952
Oh, I bet you did.
- Hey, watch it, sparks. Sparkler.

23
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,871
Hey, speakin' of sparks,

24
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,950
you don't know nothin'
about electrickery, do ya?

25
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:26,085
Only the wires of me home's
cracklin' up on me.

26
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:29,180
No, no. We're just phone boys, us.

27
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:32,480
He's quiet, isn't he?

28
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:35,522
Is there anybody there?
Or has he been disconnected?

29
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:38,818
Been cut off?
I've got a daughter like that.

30
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:41,951
Like one of them answerin' thingies.
You can only leave messages, like.

31
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,950
Say hi, Bill.
- Hello.
- Bill?

32
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:48,758
Hey, you're not the famous
phone Bill, are ya?

33
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,869
Eh, but look at you
in that bag. You ought to complain.

34
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,429
Good-lookin' on top and then that.

35
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:59,224
Clark Gable in a bag.
Or should I say 'Clark Cable'?

36
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:01,722
Ooh, eh, look at them two lookin' now.

37
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,704
Hey, this one doesn't speak neither, love.

38
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,520
You could go out, you two,
for a silent night, holy night.

39
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:12,570
Or stop at home for a bleeding quiet
night in. Be a real riot, that would.

40
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:15,375
What did I say?
What did I say?

41
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,424
Eh, look at the red on him now.
Lookie. Oh, dear.

42
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,474
Aye, you see, that's all you get
when she's upset...

43
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,669
...crappaty records full-bloody blast.

44
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:29,900
Hey, you! Trash the calypso!

45
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,150
Right. We're all done.

46
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,170
I'll just ring through and test the line.
- Oh!

47
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,824
Oh, let me do it. Let me. Let me.

48
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,544
What's the number again?
Oh, no. Don't tell me. I remember.

49
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,006
Start of the war,
Bobby Moore.

50
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:59,936
Thirty-nine, sixty-six
and me age, twenty-eight.

51
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,077
What are you laughin' at?

52
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,020
Music.

53
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,598
Music ringin' in my bloody ears.

54
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,618
Hello, me.

55
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,894
Stupid, isn't it?

56
00:06:42,998 --> 00:06:46,966
Cooped up there in the dark
all day, like a friggin' bird
trapped in the rafters.

57
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,236
Hey, steady on.
Billy's fond of his birds.

58
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:52,693
Ah, well, I didn't think he looked
like the shirt-liftin' type somehow.

59
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,250
No, feathered variety...
pigeons and that.

60
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:58,216
What?
Oh, frig me, no!

61
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:00,401
I can't be doin' with that.

62
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:03,505
All that cooin' and flappin'
and shittin' all over shop.
They want shootin', them.

63
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,599
The only good pigeons are in pies.

64
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,764
Right. If you could just sign this, Mrs., er...

65
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,208
Hoff. Mari Hoff.
Crappaty name, isn't it?

66
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,490
Me late husband Frank left it me.

67
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:27,028
You can imagine me feelin's
on signin' marriage register...
Mr. And Mrs. F. Hoff.

68
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,669
See ya.

69
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:31,938
Thanks very much,
Mr. Cable.

70
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:33,957
See ya, then.

71
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:44,194
What's it like then, eh?
To watch your master at work.

72
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,159
Did you not see her?
Legs of jelly she had for me.

73
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:51,600
Husband dead and out the way and all, eh?

74
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,446
Oh, bloody hell. Here's me imaginin'
all sorts of slap and tickle,

75
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,049
and all you can dream about
is bloody Duane.

76
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,071
LV, we out of bacon?

77
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:17,301
Recent bacon, I mean.

78
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:24,397
Oh, come on, phone. Ring.

79
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,763
Here, make me a cup of tea,
LV, love.

80
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:29,681
Come on.
Look after me.

81
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:32,395
Hey, give us that paper, here.

82
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,223
Oh, take it back.
I don't like the front.

83
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,292
Oh, shove something on,
something for me, LV, love.

84
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:44,684
Go on.
Slap some food about for me.

85
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,883
Go on. What's that you're eatin', anyway?

86
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,077
A brown envelope?
What's on telly?

87
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:53,733
Shouting]
- Oh, sod that.

88
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:57,225
Oh, sod this.
I'm off down the cafe, me.

89
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,519
I can't start the day
without some dribblin' fat, can I?

90
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:03,783
Eh, speakin' of which, I can
call Sadie on me new instrument.

91
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,702
That will freak her flabby ass.

92
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:07,717
Eh, and listen, you.

93
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,988
If anyone phones before I return,

94
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,315
you tell them I'll be back
in five minutes, all right?

95
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,680
All right?

96
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:20,152
Are you receiving me?

97
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:24,031
Ah, Sadie, it's me.

98
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:26,656
Aye, callin' long distance, me.

99
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:29,726
That I am, sexy.
Well and truly plugged in.

100
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:34,587
Eh, listen. You, me, cafe, now.
Last one out door pays, all right?

101
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:38,228
Okay.
Leg over and out.

102
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,536
Five minutes, tell 'em.
All right? Toodle-pip.

103
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,798
Fuck me.

104
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:50,902
Mention bacon and eggs and she shifts
like Linford friggin' Christie!

105
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:53,266
How are ya, sexy?
- Okay.

106
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,252
You look a bit on peckish side to me.

107
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:57,518
Move it.

108
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:03,954
You stick with me, son.
You'll learn a few tricks.

109
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:06,919
Reading matter.
That's the best one.

110
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,073
Next day or something...
when hubby's out,

111
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:13,390
you go back with the reading matter...
leaflets and that.

112
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:17,076
Works every time.
Bedtime readin', I call it.

113
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:29,385
Bangers and bubble and
a fuck hot tea, ta. Twice.

114
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,816
Bangers, mash,
fuck hot tea times two.

115
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,951
But, Sadie, what a night
I had me last night, eh.

116
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:38,623
What a friggin' championship night!

117
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,637
You should've seen me.
Queen for a night, I was.

118
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,317
You'll never guess who.

119
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,619
Ray Say.

120
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,401
Ray friggin' Say.

121
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:53,582
You know him.
He's agent to the stars...

122
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:57,009
...king of cabaret...
manager of miracles.

123
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:02,076
He's down at Mr. Boo's nightclub
all the time.

124
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:05,212
Has that slight look of Elvis about him.

125
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:08,373
You know him.
Everyone knows him.

126
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:11,027
And he knows everyone.

127
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:13,689
Eh, it was Mr. Boo himself
introduced us the other night.

128
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:16,966
And two seconds, Sadie,
I fib you not...

129
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,023
...two seconds and his hand's on me ass.

130
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:23,916
My ass. My golden old ass
in Ray Say's hand...

131
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:27,413
...while he stands there
tellin' jokes to Mr. Boo.

132
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:30,201
Well, I saw him again last night.

133
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,627
Oh, the music was in our heads...

134
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:35,953
...in our heads and in his wanderin' hands.

135
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:37,874
He'll make it in anything,
Ray Say.

136
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:40,849
He's one of them lovable twat sorta types.

137
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:44,587
Drivin' me round in his lovable twat mobile.

138
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:47,854
He motored me round
about a million miles an hour.

139
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,286
Me heart in me mouth,
his hands up me skirt...

140
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:53,796
...and me mind on his meat and veg.

141
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,482
Listen. Then it's down to
the harbor for a pronto snog.

142
00:11:57,578 --> 00:12:00,034
Oh, lip-lappin' like old hell.

143
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:03,783
But at least he knows how
to slide and dart and take a throat.

144
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,896
And at least there's the thick
wad of his wallet...

145
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,328
Up against your tit for comfort.

146
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:12,732
Oh, up and down and down and up...

147
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,545
...and under the bloody stars.

148
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:20,702
Heaven it were, Sadie.

149
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,000
What's up with you lot?
Never had a shag in a Chevy?

150
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:45,017
Hiya.

151
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:50,008
F- Forgot to leave your, er, reading matter...

152
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,632
...about services and all that.

153
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,149
Your phone's ringin'.

154
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:03,100
Would you like me to get it for ya?

155
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:11,178
Hello...

156
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,232
Dead.

157
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:35,945
Hey, you. What's this, then...
one of them rave thingies?

158
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,815
Oh, stop it.
Me ears won't take it.

159
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:41,384
I thought you were done,
you.

160
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:44,229
You suddenly remember
a socket ya unplugged, eh?

161
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,970
Telephone Bill.
Little birdie boy.

162
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:51,172
N- No, I forgot to leave this,
er, readin' matter. It tells you...

163
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:54,681
Did he ring, LV?
Did he ding-a-ling? Eh?

164
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,721
Oh, for fuck's sake,
speak, girl.

165
00:13:57,825 --> 00:14:01,240
We just... m-missed a call.

166
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,287
I can do 1-4-7-1.
It tells you who was ringin'.

167
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,522
It's one of the services mentioned
i- i-i-in the readin' matter.

168
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:18,554
There you go.
- Oh, it, it don't give a name, then?

169
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:21,754
No. I'm afraid we're not
quite that advanced yet.

170
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:24,057
Ah, well, you'd best
advance on out then, eh?

171
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:27,926
Ta very much,
but just... flap off.

172
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:32,184
Bloody hell, I don't even know
who I'm ringin' here.

173
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:34,581
Hello?

174
00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:36,914
Boo's? You what?

175
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:39,979
Oh, Mr. Boo's.

176
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:43,016
Oh, hello. Um...

177
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:45,903
Is Mr. Say there presently,
please?

178
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:47,921
It's Mari Hoff.

179
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:51,749
Ray Say. Oh, hello, love.

180
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,933
Oh, just working, you know.

181
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,333
Giving Mr. Boo here a shufti at me clients.

182
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,812
Yeah. Of course I do. I'll
see you at the Red Lion, okay?
All right, love. See ya.

183
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:03,370
Are you messin' with that Mari Hoff?

184
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,386
Hoff and on.

185
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,848
More on than Hoff, I should imagine.
- Excuse me!

186
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:10,530
Are you watching this or what?

187
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:13,095
She'll go far, this one.
- Yeah, she will and all.

188
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,174
Scunthorpe, if she's lucky.
- You're not interested?

189
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,438
Good nipples.
- Heating's off. That's why.

190
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:20,998
Mine are the same.
- All right, love.

191
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,012
Thank you.

192
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:25,730
You'll love this next one,
Mr. Boo. Singing combo...

193
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:29,088
...five lads all built like Buddha.

194
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:32,863
What are they called?
- Take Fat.

195
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,365
Hello, Billy, lad.
- Arthur.

196
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,500
Hey, did you win?

197
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:51,635
He's, er...
He's not in yet.

198
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:54,075
Not in yet?
That's not like your Duane.

199
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,470
Don't worry, Billy.

200
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:59,016
He'll be in before dark.
- Aye.

201
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:01,015
I'll see you, Billy.

202
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,935
See ya, Arthur.

203
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,252
Right, you. You got
a fuckin' second to get in shape.

204
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:59,267
Perk, girl. Perk!

205
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:02,016
Aye. Come in, Ray.
Come in.

206
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:04,928
Here he is...
Mr. Ray Say.

207
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:08,704
Here it is.

208
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,623
Me home, me walls,

209
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:13,075
me telly, me phone.

210
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,964
And me daughter.
- How do you do?

211
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:18,614
Ray. Sun Ray.
Sting Ray.

212
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:22,939
Ray gun.
Me very own Ronnie Ray gun.

213
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:25,809
Oh, I'm just friggin' into him so!

214
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:31,030
Well, say hello.

215
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:33,175
God, she's a misery.
A miserable bloody misery.

216
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:36,342
Whatcha havin', Raymondo?
- What you got?

217
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:40,853
Everything your throbbin' throat
could desire, lover boy.

218
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:44,722
All right?

219
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:46,419
Ta-da!

220
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:49,549
I'll have...
a cup of tea.

221
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,950
You what?

222
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:56,747
You'll have a cup of tea!

223
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:59,791
Hey, don't just go off like that, you rude...

224
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:02,223
Leave her! She's all right!
- Hey!

225
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:05,901
No, it's not all right.
She spoils everything, her.

226
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:09,802
I'm tryin' to make an impression and
she can't even be swivel to a friend,

227
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:12,200
the tiny little slit!

228
00:18:18,504 --> 00:18:22,300
Oh, what am I doin',
and in front of you?

229
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:24,230
Well, that's it.
I give up.

230
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:27,591
This is me crappaty home,
and this is how I am, Ray.

231
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:30,788
No gracey airs, and if you don't like
it, you can piss off out of it.

232
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:33,283
Hey, stay calm.
Don't get mad at me.

233
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,642
I- I never said anything about anything.

234
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:44,632
Come on, then.
Let's roll about.

235
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,645
Oh! Here we go!

236
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:52,788
On and on and friggin'...

237
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:56,891
Cut that racket, girl!
- Calm down. She's all right.

238
00:18:56,987 --> 00:18:59,986
Oh, you, you little raver.

239
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,536
Don't!

240
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:23,595
I'm not having this.
You can't bloody concentrate.

241
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:25,618
Cool it, will ya?

242
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:28,145
Think of the fuckin' neighbors!

243
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:34,211
Right. Sod the bitch.
We'll have our own on.

244
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:05,300
Hey, you.
You've blown me fuse!

245
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:18,494
Shh, shh!

246
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,982
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
Wha-Wha-What's that?

247
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:28,181
She got her own radio up there?
- Eh?

248
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:31,250
No. That's her.
That's LV.

249
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:33,427
What?

250
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,449
No.
- Yeah.

251
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:38,162
No.
- Yeah.

252
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,215
No.
- Yes.

253
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,353
But I don't believe it.
- Oh, God, Ray.

254
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,881
She plays records all the time.

255
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:03,049
Every God-sented sec.

256
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:06,031
They're stuck in her head and she can
sing 'em and it gets on my wick.

257
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,886
End of story.
Now come on, Ray.

258
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,982
Let's roll.

259
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:23,235
Eh, come on, lover.
I'm mad for it here.

260
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:25,256
Shh! I'm listening.

261
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:41,119
Oh, sod it.

262
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:43,901
I'm off then.

263
00:22:57,353 --> 00:23:00,133
Normal service resumed, eh?

264
00:23:00,231 --> 00:23:03,495
Bit of gray matter and a bit
of gray matter. All it takes.

265
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,845
Bit of nouse, bit of coat hanger,
and, bingo, let there be light.

266
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:11,524
But you wanna get this lot seen to,
you know. Could bring the house down.

267
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,196
Hey. So could you...

268
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:17,762
...with what you did last night, you know.

269
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:20,449
Bloody marvelous, that.
Who else you do?

270
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:25,087
Don't go. I'm just interested.
You know, what with me being
in show business myself, like.

271
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,735
Didn't your mum tell you?
No?

272
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:31,676
Oh, well. Never mind. Er,
let's plonk you down here, love,

273
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:34,396
like the twinkling star that you are.

274
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:37,243
And let me rustle up one of
Ray Say's famous breakfassays.

275
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:41,241
I do 'em for all me artists... when we're
on foreign engagements, you know.

276
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,866
It's not all glamour,
this game.

277
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,647
Fuckin' hell.

278
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,665
Marvelous...
up there in the dark.

279
00:23:56,724 --> 00:24:00,171
Something I'll never forget.
Fuck.

280
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,993
What do you say we continue our little
conversation down the cafe, eh?

281
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:11,167
No? What, and me all dressed up
and no place to go?

282
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:18,349
Certainly stripped to the waist.

283
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:20,899
There you go.
Best I can do.

284
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:23,873
Une tasse de the a la Ray.

285
00:24:28,874 --> 00:24:30,793
Yeah?

286
00:24:30,857 --> 00:24:32,776
Go on, love.
Fire away.

287
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,858
In show business...

288
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,468
I- In show business, yes?

289
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:49,248
In show business,

290
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,109
did you ever meet...

291
00:24:56,256 --> 00:24:58,016
Shirley Bassey?

292
00:24:58,111 --> 00:25:00,798
Shirley? Dear old Shirley?
Shirley, Shirley, Shirley.

293
00:25:00,894 --> 00:25:02,973
To be honest, love,
as I remember,

294
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,373
I don't think our paths ever crossed.

295
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,792
I did meet Des O'Connor, though,
and Charlie Williams.

296
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,046
Freddie 'Mr. Parrot Face' Davis?

297
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:17,305
I suppose the biggest name
I ever met was... Monroe.

298
00:25:17,593 --> 00:25:20,592
Marilyn?
- Matt.

299
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:23,479
You remember him?
The singing bus conductor.

300
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:25,494
No?

301
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,790
You like Marilyn, yeah?

302
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:31,666
Yeah.
- Can you do her as well?

303
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,826
Go on.
I bet you can.

304
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,208
Oh, well, there you go.

305
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,833
I have this thing about saxophone players.

306
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:45,998
I don't know what it is.
My spine turns to custard.

307
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:48,378
I get goose-pimply all over.

308
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:53,705
Frig me. That's ama...
That's amazing.

309
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,836
Christ! I don't believe that.

310
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,736
Listen, LV.
Listen.

311
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:04,548
You are my discovery.

312
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:07,713
I found you, right?

313
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:10,335
Me. Always remember that.

314
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:14,661
As a matter of fact, here.
Take one of me new cards.

315
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:17,060
I left it for you in case I missed you.

316
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:20,538
Look. It's gold.

317
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,442
I wouldn't give one of these
to just anyone, you know.

318
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,963
Now, look. I know
you're a bit on the quiet side,

319
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:46,043
but I'm a big noise in these parts.

320
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:51,114
And together... you and me...
we could set this place on fire.

321
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:58,443
You are a star, you.

322
00:27:05,777 --> 00:27:08,080
You're a nutter.

323
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:10,002
No, it can't wait. No.

324
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:12,337
All right. Well, hold him there.
I'm coming down now.

325
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,352
Mari, you look...

326
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:18,571
Don't speak for a minute.

327
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,941
I, I gotta go, Mari,
but what can I tell ya?

328
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:22,862
It's happened at last, eh?

329
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:26,125
It's like at the races when
you know you're on to a certainty,

330
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,076
and you're feeling,
'This is it.'

331
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:31,366
She's the one.

332
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,834
I am the one?

333
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:38,301
Give us another one, Ray!

334
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,711
Honest, Mari,
I, I can't believe it.

335
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:43,367
It's what I've been lookin' for for ages.

336
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,278
It's just one of those
once-in-a-lifetime things, eh?

337
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,860
I, I've never felt like this
before... about anyone!

338
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:52,812
I'll see you at the Seabirds later.

339
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,586
Yes!
- Bloody hell, Sadie.
The bastard wants me!

340
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,255
Too bloody right, Sadie.
Get up there and get it on.

341
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:09,139
Our fave bloody rave!

342
00:28:09,277 --> 00:28:11,415
At last! Yes! Yes!

343
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:16,185
I shall go to the ball!
Oh, you darlings from the sky!

344
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,886
Ooh!

345
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:30,039
Oh, what a life life can be!

346
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:32,207
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

347
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:39,567
Mari!
- Oh!

348
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,400
Oh, bloody hell.
What now?

349
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,356
Er, I forgot to leave you this...
reading matter.

350
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:53,742
I only ordered a phone,
not a mobile bloody library.

351
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:56,812
What?
- Young birdie boy's already
been and done all that.

352
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:01,149
Come on. Off out of it.
Make way for a woman in lust.

353
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,508
Hey, you, you twat!

354
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:12,392
What do you think you're bloody playin' at?

355
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:14,823
F-Feedin'.
- Feedin' my ass.

356
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,863
Screwin' around more like.
You come on all quiet...

357
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,709
...like you're only interested
in these bloody things here.

358
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:23,940
But, really, you're a devious
little bastard, aren't ya?

359
00:29:24,036 --> 00:29:25,859
You know what I'm on about.

360
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:28,376
Reading matter.

361
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:30,307
Ah, yes, you little bastard.

362
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:33,376
Though what you want to get your leg
over that for I'll never know.

363
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:35,296
Old enough to be your bloody grandma.

364
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:37,375
Went to see the girl,
George...

365
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:40,187
...the one with music.

366
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:43,101
What, her up...
Oh, Jesus.

367
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,885
I thought...
- Just to talk to her, like.

368
00:29:45,981 --> 00:29:48,217
Oh, aye?
- Yeah.

369
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:54,266
Thought she were... interestin'.
- Interestin', like off
her bloody rocker, you mean.

370
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:57,176
Didn't I say to you,
though, Sadie, eh?

371
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,824
I knew there was something down
for us, me and red hot Ray.

372
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,414
I just had that feelin' in me twat bone.

373
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,430
Eh? And you know me.

374
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,005
I can predict rain with that.

375
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:11,859
I'm wearin' me share-price knickers tonight,

376
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:13,875
down as likely as up,

377
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:16,458
and some shit-tight bloody bra.

378
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:21,099
'Cause I'm one high razzamatazz
in here today, me.

379
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,086
It's like there's a circus
parade passin' over me paps!

380
00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:02,133
I'm just checking to see
if your wires are all right.

381
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:07,399
I'm just seeing if your wires are all right.

382
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:15,282
I'm just seein' if your...
If your wires are all right.

383
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,901
Do you go out much?
- No.

384
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:29,591
Are you a telly fan?

385
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:31,864
No.
- Goin' anywhere on your holidays?

386
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,195
No.

387
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,171
There are no wires.
- Eh?

388
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:44,301
I finished work hours ago.

389
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,468
Oh, I don't know what to say now.

390
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:52,587
I'm Billy.
Can I ask you your name?

391
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:56,298
LV.
- Oh.

392
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,055
Does, does that stand for something?

393
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:03,718
Little Voice.
- Oh, on account
of bein' soft-spoken, like.

394
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:08,747
Nice tune, that.

395
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:11,371
'My Heart Belongs To Daddy.'

396
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:14,882
Oh. Right.

397
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:18,562
Marilyn Monroe.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

398
00:32:18,664 --> 00:32:21,830
Eh, your mom's a live wire,
ain't she? Bloody hell!

399
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:23,878
Not fond of pigeons neither,
is she?

400
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,087
Pigeons.
- Aye. I keep 'em, you know.

401
00:32:26,182 --> 00:32:28,482
Homing pigeons.
- Oh.

402
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,036
I love 'em. I'm up Pigeon Hill
all the time, where lofts are.

403
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:36,571
Feed and exercise twice a day.
- Exercise?

404
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:38,849
Aye. You let 'em out,
they fly around and come back.

405
00:32:38,946 --> 00:32:43,106
That's what homin' pigeons do...
except Duane, like.

406
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:47,324
Duane?
- Aye... me best bird.

407
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:49,811
Not back from France yet.

408
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:52,038
What's he doin' in France?

409
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,490
He's comin' back here.

410
00:32:57,627 --> 00:33:01,880
Oh.

411
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:05,528
Anyway, it can be boring
to the nonenthusiast.
- Oh, no.

412
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:08,312
N-No. You're all right.
- When you let 'em go...

413
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:13,749
...and see 'em fly, and better
still, see 'em back, well,
it's, it's dead exciting.

414
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:17,428
You'll have to come up there
with me, LV. See for yourself.

415
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:20,108
Oh, I, I don't go out.

416
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:23,145
What, never?

417
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,899
I'd best go, Billy. Bye.

418
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:29,132
I'll see you again somewhere then. Eh?

419
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,094
Talkin' to yourself and all?

420
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:37,385
Now were you?
- No.

421
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:40,172
Aye, well, I'm off out on the razz.

422
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,857
You have a nice night in with your pals, eh?

423
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:55,144
Bloody hell,
where you been? I said 8:00.

424
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,823
Aye, but look at me,
luvvy, eh?

425
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:00,390
Takes time to get dressed up like this.

426
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:03,108
Arndale Centre weren't
built in a day, you know.

427
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:05,315
Yeah, and with half as much plaster.

428
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,194
You smooth talker, you.
- You know Mr. Boo, don't you, eh?

429
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:12,545
This is Little Voice's mum.
- Oh, aye. Once-in-a-lifetime
thing, Ray tells me.

430
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:14,752
Never felt like this before
about anyone, he says.

431
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:16,767
Yeah, well, we'll get a few
quick drinks down us,

432
00:34:16,863 --> 00:34:19,135
then it's back to your place for a, a listen.

433
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:21,694
A spot of 'Who do you do?'
For Mr. Boo, like.

434
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,823
What are you havin', love?

435
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:28,186
Eh?
- Gin.

436
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:32,276
Double,
and a Campari chaser.

437
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:40,567
Oh, God.
You make me sick, you lot.

438
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:45,847
First that little phone fart,
and now you all droolin' over
that little stick of shite.

439
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:47,925
I got tits and all, you know...

440
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:50,389
...and a gob on me for every occasion.

441
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:53,421
Tits, gob and an ass to die for, me!

442
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,242
Good looker, eh, Boo?
- Just as well, with that mouth.

443
00:34:56,338 --> 00:34:58,957
No. The car, Boo.
The car.

444
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,977
Oh, aye. Yeah.

445
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:02,896
Very nice.

446
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:07,951
Put her in the back.
- I'm stoppin' here.

447
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,629
Get up, you.

448
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,494
Ray wants ya downstairs.

449
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,157
What for?
- You know what for.

450
00:35:33,253 --> 00:35:36,006
You've got him thinking you can
do something or something.

451
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:39,044
He wants you down anyway.
Show Mr. Boo what you can do.

452
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,521
It's private.
- Private, my privates.

453
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:44,802
You're just damn selfish and useless, you.

454
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:49,184
And you can do nothin' but whisper
and whine like your father before you.

455
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,422
Couple of bloody nothin's,
the pair of ya.

456
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:55,103
Look at it. Just a pile
of old junk no fucker wants.

457
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,621
Now come on downstairs!
- Don't you dare touch these!

458
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:00,691
Ever!

459
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,914
Up yours, stick leg.

460
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,870
She'll not come down.
- What?

461
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:14,104
Well, it's just like I said.
She'll not sing. I told you.

462
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,119
Dad.

463
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,221
Dad.

464
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:20,629
Dad.

465
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:24,020
Well, I'm sorry, Ray,
but Boo's a busy man.

466
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:25,939
I've got to be off.
Got other acts to see.

467
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:28,274
Acts that can be bothered.
Night, all.

468
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:30,289
Boo! Boo!

469
00:36:32,753 --> 00:36:36,113
Hold on, Boo. It won't take a minute.
Honest. She's dead special.

470
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:40,526
Listen, Say. I didn't get where
I am today by wasting my time...

471
00:36:40,623 --> 00:36:43,374
By wasting my time listening
to singers that don't sing.

472
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:49,097
All I can say is that she might
stand an outside chance as a mime act.

473
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,118
Dad.

474
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,380
You know me, Boo. I wouldn't bring you
down here for nothing.

475
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,395
You've gotta...

476
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:57,335
That's never her.

477
00:38:57,439 --> 00:39:00,122
It is.
- No.

478
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:02,228
Yeah.

479
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:04,253
No.
- Yeah.

480
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:07,580
No!
- Yeah!

481
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,756
Oh, here we go again.
- That's Judy.

482
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:12,698
You got Judy Garland in there.
- Oh, aye. She's round here
all the time...

483
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:15,833
her and that Shirley Bassey
drinking our bloody cocoa.

484
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:18,328
You have a remarkable daughter, Mrs. Hoff.

485
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:22,071
Aye, don't I bloody know.
- Well, Ray. We must have her,
if you can arrange it.

486
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,599
There's the makings of a first-class
act there... real class.

487
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:27,861
We could do a lot with that.
- Right, Mari, love.
Me and Boo are off up the pub.

488
00:39:27,957 --> 00:39:30,228
Talk finer details and finances.

489
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:33,747
Leave the latch off, eh?
- What about me then?

490
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:38,348
Where do I fit in, eh? Need
a fuckin' second-class act?

491
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:42,321
Er, mine's, mine's a double Scotch, Boo.
I'll see you up there, eh?

492
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:45,065
What are you saying, Mari?

493
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,599
I'm tellin' you you're sittin' on a gold mine...

494
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:52,425
...not over a bloody rainbow,
but up there in that bedroom.

495
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:57,381
'Dreams that you dare to dream,' eh?

496
00:39:57,515 --> 00:39:59,969
She can make them come true.

497
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,090
She's our chance, Mari.

498
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:20,068
We've been shoveling shit
long enough, you and me.

499
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:23,424
Now's our chance to step out of it.

500
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:27,795
Our chance?
- Oh, I'm going nowhere
without you, girl.

501
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:33,880
Oh, Elvis breath.

502
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:40,251
Come on then.
Lead us to the dotted line.

503
00:41:34,442 --> 00:41:38,750
Love, luvvy. Don't worry.
It's only us... me and Ray.

504
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:42,632
Coming bearing good news, m'lady.
- Stupendous news, actually.

505
00:41:42,727 --> 00:41:46,630
Mr. Boo would like you
to sing at his club on stage.

506
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:49,061
Sing what you like.
- He'll pay. Good money and all.

507
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:52,035
Could be up to 50 quid, right?
- Yeah, and that's just to start.

508
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,294
No!
- No? Listen. Ray'll look after ya.

509
00:41:55,394 --> 00:41:58,785
He knows all about showbiz,
and all you have to do is sing.

510
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,505
Sing!
Like what you do best anyway.

511
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:05,087
You might feel shy.
- Oh, nothin' wrong
with being shy at first.

512
00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:09,502
It's natural, that.
- Had a girl recently
wouldn't say boo to a goose.

513
00:42:09,597 --> 00:42:12,541
Now she's toppin' the bill
at the Reform Club.
- Who's that? That stripper?

514
00:42:12,636 --> 00:42:15,836
Yeah. Well, I mean, it's similar,
innit? I mean, similar case, Tina.

515
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:18,363
Please go.
- It's not healthy being cooped up here...

516
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:20,598
Just go!

517
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:25,137
Bloody hell.
That's gratitude for ya.

518
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:32,657
You great long streak of piss!

519
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,658
You are bloody doin' it, girl!

520
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:43,886
Come on. You can do better than that.
So how you all doin'?

521
00:42:54,382 --> 00:42:56,973
The manager says, 'Do you want
that condom on your bill, sir?'

522
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,459
And the duck says, 'Certainly not.
What sort of duck do you think I am?'

523
00:43:00,556 --> 00:43:03,044
Hey, true story, this. Two...

524
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:08,229
All you've gotta do is stand here and sing.

525
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,459
Like at home.

526
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:14,755
Just... stay calm and relax.

527
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:17,415
What are you talkin' about,
relax? Look at her!

528
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,128
Think about... Judy.

529
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:23,869
Think about... Shirley.

530
00:43:28,516 --> 00:43:31,809
Think about... Marilyn.

531
00:43:33,857 --> 00:43:36,449
Anyway, on with the show,
ladies and gentlemen.

532
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:39,194
As you know,
Boo braves anything,

533
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:41,502
goes anywhere in his perpetual quest...

534
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,477
...for fresh talent to spice up
your midweek merriment here.

535
00:43:44,573 --> 00:43:48,796
And guess which exotic part of the world
I came across tonight's star turn?

536
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:51,029
Shipley Street.

537
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:54,720
Well, it saves on travel expenses, don't it?

538
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:58,520
Anyway, pretty people,
enough of me.

539
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:01,240
A talent...
an undiscovered treasure...

540
00:44:01,335 --> 00:44:03,350
...an act of wonder,
ladies and gentlemen.

541
00:44:03,445 --> 00:44:07,573
A little girl that's big...
a northern light... a rising star...

542
00:44:07,668 --> 00:44:09,715
Order and hush.
Hush and order...

543
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:13,139
...for the turn of turns...
a- the one, a-the only...

544
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,505
Little Voice, ladies and gentlemen!

545
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:17,521
Little Voice!

546
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,549
Go on.

547
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:33,100
You're on.

548
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:35,846
Go on. Go on.
Go on. Sing.

549
00:44:35,948 --> 00:44:38,217
I'll do anything.
Just sing.

550
00:44:38,348 --> 00:44:40,767
Sing, for fuck's sake.
Sing!

551
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:45,321
The lights.
It's the lights.

552
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,336
Turn out the lights.

553
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:27,761
Get off!

554
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:31,661
Do another one. Go on.
Do some more.

555
00:45:31,768 --> 00:45:35,596
More? Do you really want more?

556
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:38,004
Oh, aren't you tired?

557
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,957
Well, we've got,
we've only got one more.

558
00:45:40,053 --> 00:45:43,396
We-We'll do, we'll do,
we'll do 'Chicago.'

559
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:05,773
What have you
stopped for? Don't stop now.

560
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:11,463
Do anything. Anything.
And, Jesus, look happy!

561
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:28,380
This is crazy, Ray.
The punters can't see.

562
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:34,293
All right, then.
Get 'em back up.

563
00:46:34,307 --> 00:46:36,695
Get the lights back up.

564
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:55,355
Thought things couldn't go downhill with
you, Ray. What am I gonna tell 'em?

565
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:58,233
Tell 'em...
she'll be back.

566
00:47:00,794 --> 00:47:04,026
Embarrassin'. One hundred
bloody chunk embarrassin', that.

567
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:07,096
I'm shown up, which was more than
she was, stood there in bloody dark.

568
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,583
He wasn't there.
- And what was she singing?
What the hell was that?

569
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:13,494
She could've made an effort
and done some Spice Girls or
something, for Christ's sake!

570
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,541
I told you you was wasting
your time on the little slit!

571
00:47:15,636 --> 00:47:18,931
She did the whole thing
to spite Mother. I know her.

572
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:21,165
Oh... go on.
Drop her off.

573
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:23,600
Dump her home.
Let's go eat.

574
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:29,999
Now then.

575
00:47:30,095 --> 00:47:32,015
Oh, Jesus.
- Guess what.

576
00:47:32,046 --> 00:47:34,127
I've just seen your bird.
- Where?

577
00:47:34,222 --> 00:47:36,047
On stage, down at Boo's.

578
00:47:36,142 --> 00:47:39,076
What?

579
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:41,100
Oh, no.
Not Duane.

580
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,020
I meant the other one.

581
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,320
That lass.

582
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,178
Hello?
- LV?

583
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:00,286
Hello.
- Eh, listen.

584
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,755
I, I heard about what you did tonight.

585
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:06,167
At Boo's club.
- They made me.

586
00:48:06,275 --> 00:48:08,066
Who made you?
- Him and her.

587
00:48:08,162 --> 00:48:10,081
They go on till you do.

588
00:48:10,114 --> 00:48:12,352
They trying to make you do it again?

589
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:16,609
Don't think she liked it.
Won't be doin' it no more.

590
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:20,543
Oh, but, Ray,
it were crap awful, weren't it?

591
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,678
Well, er, she's not
what you'd call a performer.

592
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:26,174
I- I'll grant you that, no.
But I can take care of that.

593
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:29,883
She just needs a, a big band
or something to boost her confidence...

594
00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:32,150
...er, a big, flashy set.

595
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:36,121
Bright lights, a bit of glitz,
snazzy frocks. All that.

596
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:38,393
I love it when you talk swanky.

597
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:40,087
Has, has Duane come home?

598
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:43,150
No. No, no.
Not yet.

599
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,109
Happens sometimes,
once they're out.

600
00:48:46,164 --> 00:48:48,586
Flyin' free.

601
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,612
They like it.

602
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,292
You should try it sometime, LV.

603
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:59,405
Oh, I've got to go.

604
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:02,122
I've, I've got to go. Bye.
- LV?

605
00:49:07,565 --> 00:49:09,484
What was she like?

606
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:17,124
Well, if it's a roller-coaster
of unbridled excitement you're after,

607
00:49:17,483 --> 00:49:20,338
I reckon you're better off up here.

608
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,999
You're all right, love?

609
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,918
It's only me.

610
00:49:35,365 --> 00:49:39,160
Been workin' on the act...
planning and that.

611
00:49:39,266 --> 00:49:42,306
Got Boo to let us have another go.
I've worked it all out.

612
00:49:42,403 --> 00:49:46,817
You'll love it...
everything tailored to your personality.

613
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:50,584
All you've got to do
is step on from the side.

614
00:49:50,623 --> 00:49:53,884
What's up? Hey, angel.

615
00:49:53,982 --> 00:49:57,822
You're not gonna let a little hiccup
like tonight put you off, are you?

616
00:49:57,917 --> 00:50:00,028
That happens to the best of 'em, you know.

617
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,897
If you could ask her or her or her,

618
00:50:04,026 --> 00:50:05,850
they'd all tell you the same thing.

619
00:50:05,945 --> 00:50:08,538
They've all had nights like that,
you know. Isn't that right, Judy?

620
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:11,416
'It sure is, Mr. Say.'
And what about you, Marilyn?

621
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:14,551
'Too, too true, boo boo be doo.'
- Don't!

622
00:50:14,647 --> 00:50:16,662
Seriously, LV.
It'll never happen again.

623
00:50:16,758 --> 00:50:19,605
Not with this.
It's foolproof.

624
00:50:19,702 --> 00:50:21,904
Believe me.
Let's do it, eh?

625
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,476
You won't even look at it?

626
00:50:30,066 --> 00:50:32,848
Well, never mind then, eh?

627
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,377
Never mind.
That's it, then, eh?

628
00:50:35,472 --> 00:50:38,286
No problem.
Pas de problemo.

629
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:42,732
Got it nice here,
haven't you?

630
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:46,282
Clean and tidy.
That's nice.

631
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:50,122
All your records all around ya.

632
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:53,289
Your dad must have spent years
buildin' up a collection like this.

633
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:55,874
He did.
- Yeah.

634
00:50:55,978 --> 00:50:58,696
I'm not one for collecting things meself.

635
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,312
Only debts.

636
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:07,120
I had an auntie once who was, though.

637
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:11,712
You'll never guess what she collected.

638
00:51:12,418 --> 00:51:14,785
Go on.

639
00:51:16,898 --> 00:51:18,721
Bluebirds.

640
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:21,719
Honest.
Wild bluebirds.

641
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:23,744
Flyin' all over her house.

642
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,240
Marvelous with 'em she was and all.

643
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,607
Even taught one of them to talk once.

644
00:51:28,702 --> 00:51:32,157
Timid little thing, it was.
No bigger... than your thumb.

645
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:34,908
Too scared even to leave his cage.

646
00:51:35,004 --> 00:51:38,352
But what she did was so simple.

647
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:42,418
All she did was keep it shaded and safe...

648
00:51:42,522 --> 00:51:45,586
...at all times,

649
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:49,069
and then sing to it and stroke it...

650
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:52,588
...very, very soft every day.

651
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:57,580
And after a while,
it gave her his heart.

652
00:51:57,684 --> 00:52:01,426
Later,
when it grew strong,

653
00:52:01,522 --> 00:52:03,441
she set it free.

654
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,463
But before it flew to its freedom,

655
00:52:08,304 --> 00:52:11,501
it stopped...
on the window ledge.

656
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,307
Then it turned to her...

657
00:52:15,406 --> 00:52:18,220
...and, to her great surprise,

658
00:52:18,316 --> 00:52:20,235
sang.

659
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:29,896
See? There she goes.

660
00:52:31,177 --> 00:52:33,597
True story, that.

661
00:52:37,383 --> 00:52:39,206
Which are your dad's favorites?

662
00:52:39,302 --> 00:52:41,221
Them three there.

663
00:52:41,222 --> 00:52:44,002
Oh, good.
You know what we'll...

664
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:47,613
Oh, no. No.
- What?

665
00:52:47,714 --> 00:52:51,522
No. Well, I, I, I was just
thinking we, we could have
included them, uh, in the, er,

666
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:53,538
you know... the act.

667
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:56,827
But we're not doin' it now.

668
00:52:58,145 --> 00:53:00,605
I bet your dad would have liked that, eh?

669
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:03,320
A tribute to his life's loves.

670
00:53:03,422 --> 00:53:05,244
One love, his songs,

671
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,925
sung by his only other love...

672
00:53:08,028 --> 00:53:09,947
...his daughter.

673
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:13,731
Huh? That would have
really been something, eh?

674
00:53:14,938 --> 00:53:16,857
Yeah. A shame.

675
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:20,625
'Cause the man and his music...

676
00:53:20,728 --> 00:53:23,909
...they don't get much respect,
do they?

677
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,037
You know what I mean.

678
00:53:30,932 --> 00:53:34,248
Ray.
- Hmm?

679
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:39,467
Nothin'.

680
00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:41,808
Whoops.
There she goes again...

681
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:45,901
...the bluebird under the moon
and over the stars.

682
00:53:50,573 --> 00:53:52,493
I'll do it.

683
00:53:52,493 --> 00:53:55,110
Do what?

684
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:57,894
Oh, that. Oh, okay.

685
00:53:57,994 --> 00:54:01,343
Just once.
- Yeah.

686
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,424
Whatever, whatever.

687
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:07,110
I'm pleased.

688
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:12,215
I'll just pop down and get me cigarillos.

689
00:54:13,382 --> 00:54:15,452
Won't be a tic.

690
00:54:27,872 --> 00:54:30,431
The overall effect I want,
Frank, is like Las Vegas.

691
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:34,034
Plush up the bandstand,
big musical notes...

692
00:54:37,053 --> 00:54:41,242
Up here on the stage...

693
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:13,417
Hold on. Thank you, lo...

694
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:19,015
Come on!

695
00:55:35,914 --> 00:55:38,605
Bloody hell.
All right, all right.

696
00:55:45,701 --> 00:55:49,697
This has come to a lot more
than I thought, Frank.

697
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,687
There you go.
- Thanks.

698
00:55:54,788 --> 00:55:57,316
Right, Phil.
- Yes, Mr. Hoskins.

699
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:36,302
Well, a man with a plan
or what, eh? My Ray.

700
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:40,722
Worked it all out, he has.
Gonna take us all to Tarby-land.

701
00:56:40,818 --> 00:56:45,522
I had me doubts about her doin' again
at first, but, well, he won me over.

702
00:56:45,617 --> 00:56:49,958
Try as I do,
I cannot say no to that man.

703
00:56:50,065 --> 00:56:54,798
What a tongue he has on him, eh, Sadie?
Half raspberry, half razor.

704
00:56:54,894 --> 00:56:58,319
Oh, I don't know, Sadie.
Maybe this once...

705
00:56:58,444 --> 00:57:01,548
...that fucker fate's smilin' down on us, eh?

706
00:57:01,645 --> 00:57:05,898
Ohh. Liquor, lacquer.
Liquor, lacquer.

707
00:57:05,995 --> 00:57:07,936
Ow! Bloody hell!

708
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:10,887
Oh, my God!
I've blinded me god.

709
00:57:10,984 --> 00:57:13,543
No, I'm all right.
I'm all right. All right.

710
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,704
Here you are.
I've got you something.

711
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:20,449
Ow.
- Oh, Raymondo!

712
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:26,401
Lookie here,
little sparkle-neck me.

713
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:29,378
See, Sadie?
It's a love token.

714
00:57:29,474 --> 00:57:31,489
That's right,
isn't it, Ray?

715
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:35,513
Someways I wish I could
lash it 'round me finger.

716
00:57:35,616 --> 00:57:41,163
You look stunning, Sadie. We gonna
have a dance down there later, eh?

717
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:45,878
Go upstairs now, Sadie.
See if star turn's ready.

718
00:57:45,981 --> 00:57:50,555
I can't wait, Mari, can you?
I'm buzzing. Fit to burst.
Big crowd, proper job.

719
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:54,010
I've even got a talent scout coming down.
- Oh, give us your lips, you,

720
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:56,493
and double me palpitations.

721
00:58:00,761 --> 00:58:04,839
Fuck me.
- Not now, Ray, we got
a show to do. Ha ha!

722
00:58:12,212 --> 00:58:15,025
Right. Are we set, then, or what?

723
00:58:15,123 --> 00:58:17,427
Let me open that front door...

724
00:58:17,522 --> 00:58:21,230
...the door that leads to success.

725
00:58:21,327 --> 00:58:24,687
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Yea, thrice welcome to Mr. Boo's.

726
00:58:24,783 --> 00:58:26,862
Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

727
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,878
Boo.
- Boo who?

728
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:30,893
Don't be so fucking pathetic.

729
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,356
How are you all doing? All right?

730
00:58:33,451 --> 00:58:36,332
Come on! You can do better than that.
How are you all doing? All right?

731
00:58:36,427 --> 00:58:39,425
That's more like it.

732
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:42,505
Because we've pulled out all the stops
for your Friday night frolickings!

733
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:45,863
We haven't had a band in here
this big since VE Day.

734
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,031
In fact, now that I look at 'em,
it's the same band.

735
00:58:49,127 --> 00:58:52,454
It's all right. They know me.
We're in for a grand night tonight!

736
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:56,804
So smack one hand against t'other, if
you will, for the turn of turns return!

737
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:01,250
The voice of a thousand stars.
The girl with the greats
queuing up in her gullet!

738
00:59:01,347 --> 00:59:05,409
A- the one, a-the only Little Voice,
ladies and gentlemen!

739
00:59:05,506 --> 00:59:07,676
Li-i-i-i...

740
00:59:07,776 --> 00:59:09,696
...ttl-l-l-le...

741
00:59:09,697 --> 00:59:12,445
Voi-oi-oi-oice!

742
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:45,118
Yes!

743
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,419
Who's on the phone?

744
01:04:06,522 --> 01:04:08,793
It's Bunny Morris.
- Bunny Morris?

745
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:12,849
That's right.

746
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:39,893
That's my fuckin' daughter!

747
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:06,385
Well, a star is bloody born or what, eh?

748
01:06:06,481 --> 01:06:09,808
Guess who I just spoke to...
only Bunny Morris.

749
01:06:09,903 --> 01:06:12,653
Never!
- Who's Bunny Morris?

750
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:14,926
The fixer.
Bunny 'Mr. Starmaker' Morris.

751
01:06:15,022 --> 01:06:17,485
Any new star you name,
love, he got 'em started.

752
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:20,172
He puts 'em in all the big clubs
and all the TV shows.

753
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:25,099
If he rates 'em, that's it. Nobody says
no to Bunny Morris, and neither did I.

754
01:06:25,195 --> 01:06:27,754
He's only comin' here
tomorrow night to see her.
- No!

755
01:06:27,849 --> 01:06:31,401
Yeah, he is. He's comin' here,
honest. I gotta pick him up
at the Grand at 7:00.

756
01:06:31,498 --> 01:06:34,280
Tomorrow? We're on
tomorrow night and all?
- Yeah.

757
01:06:34,376 --> 01:06:36,679
Aye, aye. I've had to cancel
Silverados and Gringo Hodges.

758
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:39,238
Had to. They were going
mad in here tonight.
- 'Once,' we said.

759
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,285
When Bunny sees her,
he'll do the same.

760
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:45,315
We'll never be off the telly. MFI
Friday, Letterman... he'll fix 'em all.

761
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:48,312
'Just once,' we said.

762
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:50,754
Today this crap-house,
tomorrow the bloody world.

763
01:06:50,851 --> 01:06:54,559
Route bloody One...
London, Leeds, Las Vegas.

764
01:06:54,656 --> 01:06:58,334
Yee-haa!
- Just remember where
you got your start...

765
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,574
my crap-house,
and you know what they say,

766
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:03,710
'Shouldn't shit on folk
on way up, 'cause you're
bound to meet 'em on way down.'

767
01:07:03,805 --> 01:07:08,220
Yeah, but we're not comin' down,
Boo. Up to the sky we're goin'.
Up to the bloody sky.

768
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:12,057
Here's to the rise of rise of Little Voice.

769
01:07:17,657 --> 01:07:21,495
God! The little bird's bleated
and died with all the shock.

770
01:07:21,591 --> 01:07:25,302
It's all right, Mari. She's just tired.
Bright lights and all that.

771
01:07:25,399 --> 01:07:29,236
Blessed are the meek for they shall
inherit the Earth. But when, eh? When?

772
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:33,011
Don't push her too hard.
- She needs pushing. That's the point.

773
01:07:33,108 --> 01:07:35,569
I've seen a lot of big talent
wasted in my time.

774
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,971
Don't come the fucking impresario with me.

775
01:07:38,066 --> 01:07:41,360
You run a club that no one
in their right mind wants to go to.

776
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:44,048
You tell jokes that no one
in their right mind wants to laugh at.

777
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:48,749
You're a nothing, Boo. It's me
with the contacts now, me with
the friends in the high places.

778
01:07:48,845 --> 01:07:52,352
Remember that. It's Ray who's the big shot.

779
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,513
Do you not want a ride home?
- Yeah.

780
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:00,681
I may not have friends in high places, Ray,

781
01:08:00,778 --> 01:08:04,774
but I've got 'em in
the fuckin' used car business.

782
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:20,003
LV!

783
01:08:20,962 --> 01:08:23,383
I know you're there, LV.

784
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:28,139
You did it again, didn't you?
And again, tonight, it says.

785
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,232
LV!

786
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,108
LV, I'm worried.
Are you all right?

787
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:37,561
Look, just don't let them do it to ya.

788
01:08:37,693 --> 01:08:41,270
LV, I know you're there. I just want...

789
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:45,168
Duane?

790
01:08:45,306 --> 01:08:48,023
Hey, fuck off, Romeo!

791
01:08:48,122 --> 01:08:53,831
You want to see her? Then sod off
down club and pay like everyone else.

792
01:08:57,368 --> 01:08:59,989
Do without that sort of crap
just before show, eh?

793
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:02,933
When you need to be
concentrating your mind.

794
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:05,204
Come on, love.
Enough of this.

795
01:09:05,299 --> 01:09:08,755
You've not opened your beak
all day to eat or to squeak.

796
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:12,684
And even you squeak
from time to time, don't ya?

797
01:09:13,681 --> 01:09:17,291
Come on, love.
Squeak to me, eh?

798
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,406
Duane.

799
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:43,074
Steady, steady.
Steady.

800
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:52,963
A long time since I've been
dragged down the Northern clubs, Say.

801
01:09:53,059 --> 01:09:57,280
Better be good.
- Oh, yeah. Great, eh?

802
01:09:57,378 --> 01:09:59,298
Come in.

803
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:05,087
Now, then, I'd thought you'd be showin'
up here sooner or later. You goin' in?

804
01:10:05,183 --> 01:10:08,254
Eh, don't know. Hello.
You must be George's wife.

805
01:10:08,349 --> 01:10:11,513
Wife? You bastard!

806
01:10:13,564 --> 01:10:15,767
Sorry, George.
Sorry.

807
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:21,881
For one not known for his over-usage of
words, you don't half pick 'em, do ya?

808
01:10:21,977 --> 01:10:25,322
Spare ticket now if you want one.
- Sorry.

809
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:29,079
No, she's not moved, Sadie, love.

810
01:10:29,175 --> 01:10:31,958
But she's going to have
to in a minute, otherwise
she'll be going on like she is.

811
01:10:32,054 --> 01:10:35,670
I bet that Judy Garland never went
on stage in her bloody pajamas,

812
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,196
so I don't know why she wants to.

813
01:10:38,293 --> 01:10:43,794
Oh, Come on, LV, love, whatever it is
that's buggin' ya, just let it stop, eh?

814
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:48,593
Just for a few hours, 'cause, look,
we're cutting things a bit fine now.

815
01:10:48,689 --> 01:10:53,582
Ray'll be here in a minute and
your mum's getting just a little
bit fucking irate, all right?

816
01:10:53,678 --> 01:10:59,149
Ladies and gentlemen,
will you welcome, please,
on this night of all nights...

817
01:10:59,246 --> 01:11:02,179
the compare of all compares;

818
01:11:02,285 --> 01:11:04,868
the world's finest emcee;

819
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:08,713
the funniest man ever
to have been on television;

820
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:12,392
the man the Northern Echo called
'quite amusing';

821
01:11:12,488 --> 01:11:15,337
the chuckle bag himself:

822
01:11:15,431 --> 01:11:18,626
Your very ow-w-w-wn...

823
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:21,539
Mi-i-i-ister Boo!

824
01:11:27,844 --> 01:11:30,559
Welcome to Mr. Boo's.
I'm Mr. Boo.

825
01:11:30,657 --> 01:11:33,441
Don't shout my name too loud.
I'll think you don't like me.

826
01:11:33,537 --> 01:11:37,562
How y'all doin'? All right?

827
01:11:37,663 --> 01:11:41,246
Come on. You can do better than that.
How y'all doin'? All right?

828
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:45,340
That's more like it. Have we
got some entertainment tonight.

829
01:11:45,437 --> 01:11:48,604
I don't know. Have we got some
entertainment for 'em tonight?
Of course we have.

830
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,322
And we all know what
that entertainment is, don't we?

831
01:11:51,418 --> 01:11:54,425
Tonight, for the second
consecutive night in a row,

832
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:57,464
sees the return of young Little Voice.

833
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:00,723
Thank you.

834
01:12:00,824 --> 01:12:02,743
Thank you. Thank you.

835
01:12:04,599 --> 01:12:07,094
But that's all in the future.
That's to look forward to.

836
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,933
Ray's going to kill me.
He's going to throttle me.

837
01:12:11,028 --> 01:12:14,930
Then what'd you be like, eh,
with me murdered? Oh, be up
and about, then, I suppose.

838
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:19,090
Happy as a lark. Oh, there be
no bloody croonin' for your dead mum.

839
01:12:19,185 --> 01:12:21,486
Oh, no. Oh, no.

840
01:12:21,617 --> 01:12:25,641
Oh, no! He's here!
He's here! Jesus! Jesus!

841
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:29,833
Oh, come on!
LV, love, please.

842
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:32,201
Eh, do it for your mum, eh?

843
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,988
Oh, do somethin' for me,
for Christ's sake,

844
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,347
instead of that lousy,
dopey drip of a dead dad!

845
01:12:38,443 --> 01:12:40,362
Fuck!

846
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:50,302
Darling.

847
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:53,252
All right, Mari?
Okay?

848
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:55,552
Bloody hell.
This is it, eh?

849
01:12:55,684 --> 01:12:57,626
Where's she then?

850
01:12:57,764 --> 01:13:00,992
LV,
management is here.

851
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:03,936
Ray, love, there's, um...

852
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:05,953
...a bit of a...

853
01:13:05,953 --> 01:13:08,258
It's LV. She's dead tired.
She's really...

854
01:13:08,353 --> 01:13:11,871
Aren't we all, love. She'll be
all right once she gets on there.

855
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:14,975
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for our first act...

856
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:19,580
...five lads from Grimsby who have
a history of touching assholes.

857
01:13:19,676 --> 01:13:24,344
I said 'our souls,' madam.
The biggest thing in rock,

858
01:13:24,443 --> 01:13:26,417
Take Fat!

859
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:47,411
Could she not have this night off?
- This night off?

860
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:51,249
What are you on about? Bunny Morris
is there. He's there now, waiting.

861
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:55,025
This night off? This night?
This is the night, love!

862
01:13:55,121 --> 01:13:58,697
Fuck! Fuckin' house!

863
01:13:58,831 --> 01:14:00,975
But, Ray...
- Ray, Ray, Ray, what?

864
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:05,474
Did you get her dress from
the dry cleaners okay? Yeah?

865
01:14:07,212 --> 01:14:09,993
Sadie, love,
you pick up the dress?

866
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:13,929
Oh, no. You forgot it.
- I've been so busied with her, Ray.

867
01:14:14,025 --> 01:14:17,161
Jesus Christ.
- Hey! Watch me furniture, you!

868
01:14:17,257 --> 01:14:20,039
Furniture?
- Now, then, a novelty act...

869
01:14:20,135 --> 01:14:22,437
...noveler than any I know.

870
01:14:22,535 --> 01:14:25,731
So please give a big Mr. Boo welcome...

871
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:30,400
...to Brenda Bailey and her farmyard frolics.

872
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:39,426
Two things... that's all you had to do...
get the dress and have her ready.

873
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:42,138
Oh, I know.
I'm sorry, darling.

874
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:46,622
But don't be crossy with
your darling puss-puss.
- Never mind all that crap.

875
01:14:46,718 --> 01:14:48,758
Good boy. Jump!

876
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:53,436
Where's LV?
Have you seen Ray Say or LV?

877
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:57,114
No.
- Christ. Trigger,
you better string it out a bit.

878
01:14:57,211 --> 01:14:59,834
Do an extra five minutes.
- I'll do it blindfolded.

879
01:14:59,931 --> 01:15:02,580
Yeah.
- Oh, no.

880
01:15:02,712 --> 01:15:05,785
Sadie, give that a once-over with iron, eh?
- Okay.

881
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,534
What? She's not even dressed?
We can't have this, Mari.

882
01:15:08,631 --> 01:15:11,830
I'm gonna have to get
someone else to look after her.

883
01:15:11,926 --> 01:15:14,228
Ray, no.
What are you sayin'?

884
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:29,201
Eh, you're too quiet to be
me friend, you. Fuck off!

885
01:15:33,391 --> 01:15:38,375
Eh, I'm doin' it now,
Ray, love. Yes, I am.

886
01:15:38,509 --> 01:15:42,730
So a big welcome, please,
to Wild Trigger Smith...

887
01:15:42,827 --> 01:15:44,866
...and the lovely Elaine!

888
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:57,410
Leave it! Aah!
- Oh!

889
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,431
Fuckin' house!
- Ray!

890
01:15:59,431 --> 01:16:01,765
Aah! What? What?
- Kiss me, Ray.

891
01:16:01,861 --> 01:16:04,260
Oh, give over. We haven't got the time.
- Eh, lover...

892
01:16:04,357 --> 01:16:08,482
Stop clinging, will ya? You're all over
me all the time, like the bloody pox.

893
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:13,432
Don't spoil it, Raymondo.
We go so well together.

894
01:16:13,537 --> 01:16:18,685
We go nowhere. For a start,
you're past it. You're body's gone.

895
01:16:18,784 --> 01:16:22,717
When your clothes go, I can't keep
track of it. It's all over the place.

896
01:16:22,814 --> 01:16:27,707
There's no way that
you're coming with me and her
to better things. No way, love.

897
01:16:27,803 --> 01:16:30,268
LV! You got ten fucking seconds!

898
01:16:30,363 --> 01:16:34,441
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

899
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:44,069
All you're doin' is gettin' in the way.

900
01:16:45,174 --> 01:16:48,437
You were in the way
the first night I heard her,

901
01:16:48,532 --> 01:16:50,708
and you're still in the way now.

902
01:16:50,805 --> 01:16:54,638
Christ. Do you think
I don't have birds I go to?

903
01:16:55,827 --> 01:17:00,884
Don't you think it's like puttin'
me face in flowers after you?

904
01:17:01,904 --> 01:17:03,976
You've had it, Mari.

905
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:06,862
For God's sake,
wise up, woman, eh?

906
01:17:08,078 --> 01:17:11,208
Eh?
And fuck off.

907
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:21,767
Elaine, are you still there?

908
01:17:21,865 --> 01:17:26,601
Get 'em off, Boo!
You go on. It's not right.
- They're doin' fine.

909
01:17:26,697 --> 01:17:29,280
Curtains!

910
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:32,167
Ta. Thank you. Ta. A big hand,
ladies and gentlemen,

911
01:17:32,264 --> 01:17:34,466
For Wild Trigger Smith...

912
01:17:34,565 --> 01:17:38,459
...and the lovely,
lucky Elaine!

913
01:17:40,707 --> 01:17:44,928
Sadie!

914
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:50,682
What're you doin'?
Here, get this on.

915
01:17:50,783 --> 01:17:55,069
Come on. I've had enough
of you lot tonight.
Dress on now. Move it, will ya?

916
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:57,554
Hello, number one.

917
01:17:57,661 --> 01:18:00,797
What's your name,
where'd you come from?
- What?

918
01:18:00,892 --> 01:18:05,114
Hello, everybody.
This is Mrs... Norman... Maine.

919
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:07,514
Stop messin' about.
We're late.

920
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:12,585
So hurry before they shut the gate.
- Save it for the punters.

921
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:15,341
I'm warnin' you, LV.

922
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,719
I know... I'll
sing 'em all and we'll stay all night.

923
01:18:17,815 --> 01:18:21,458
See what I mean? Not very bright.

924
01:18:21,557 --> 01:18:23,923
But the villain only laughed!

925
01:18:23,956 --> 01:18:26,257
LV, come on.
Run, Toto, run!

926
01:18:26,356 --> 01:18:30,216
Stop it.

927
01:18:30,322 --> 01:18:33,255
We're on our way together.

928
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:37,611
LV, why?

929
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:42,668
I warned you...
Shame on you!

930
01:18:45,644 --> 01:18:49,190
Never mind your teeth! Leave 'em out!

931
01:18:52,074 --> 01:18:54,178
Fuckin' house!

932
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:08,770
Lions and tigers and bears. Oh, my!

933
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:11,650
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

934
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:15,778
I'm frightened, Auntie Em!
I'm frightened!

935
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,210
Now we're cookin', aren't we?
You hear about this chicken?

936
01:19:18,305 --> 01:19:21,338
He went into a library in Essex...

937
01:19:21,472 --> 01:19:26,686
No, uh... No, that weren't
a chicken, was it? Uh...

938
01:19:26,782 --> 01:19:31,003
Uh... Oh, it's gone.
Boo! Bollocks! Boo!

939
01:19:41,306 --> 01:19:44,281
She's a redhead, my wife. No hair,
just a read head.

940
01:19:44,376 --> 01:19:47,448
I love her terribly, I do.
That's what she says, anyway.

941
01:19:47,544 --> 01:19:51,638
Listen, calm down, calm down.
She'll be along in a sec.

942
01:19:51,735 --> 01:19:55,766
What did I tell ya? I said if you
didn't laugh at my jokes, I'd sing.

943
01:19:55,861 --> 01:19:59,763
That's what I said. Well, Boo's
a man of his word, I'm afraid.

944
01:19:59,858 --> 01:20:04,242
Will you bear with me? Uh, anyway,
as they say in the business,

945
01:20:04,338 --> 01:20:07,435
this, ladies and gentlemen,
is me.

946
01:20:12,528 --> 01:20:14,981
Ray!

947
01:20:18,094 --> 01:20:20,908
I had something...
ladies and gentlemen.

948
01:20:21,003 --> 01:20:23,589
I had something really special.

949
01:20:23,724 --> 01:20:27,136
This is my room... and you're all here...

950
01:20:27,274 --> 01:20:30,729
...and I'm not gonna leave here
ever, ever again,

951
01:20:30,824 --> 01:20:33,638
because I love you all.

952
01:20:33,736 --> 01:20:36,997
End?

953
01:20:37,094 --> 01:20:40,997
They never bloody started.
Bunny Morris. Bunny 'Starmaker' Morris.

954
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:44,408
Fuck off,
ya jumped-up little prat.

955
01:20:49,443 --> 01:20:54,500
Just as well, 'cause they always
fuck it up for ya, don't they?

956
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,678
Well, mine has.

957
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:05,725
That's because they can't fucking hack it.

958
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:09,016
Cheering]
- Ladies and gentlemen,

959
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:12,379
I had a dream.
- There's no place like home.

960
01:21:12,475 --> 01:21:16,088
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

961
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:21,731
When I think of what might've been, eh?
- There's no place like home.

962
01:21:23,574 --> 01:21:25,996
Finished,
fucking finished me.

963
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,920
What will I do, eh?

964
01:21:37,074 --> 01:21:39,692
What the fuck am I gonna do?

965
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:50,248
There's no place like home.

966
01:21:50,349 --> 01:21:52,334
There's no place like home.

967
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:54,349
LV!

968
01:22:05,575 --> 01:22:07,860
Over the fuckin' rainbow,
eh?

969
01:22:10,438 --> 01:22:13,153
Good-fucking-bye!

970
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,930
Okay.

971
01:22:37,694 --> 01:22:41,854
LV! My baby!
- It's all right, love.
Everybody's out.

972
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:19,694
The adorable Mr. Ray Say,
ladies and gentlemen,

973
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:22,797
with a little song about
his show business career...

974
01:23:22,894 --> 01:23:25,130
...called, 'It's Over.'

975
01:23:30,315 --> 01:23:33,349
So, how you all doin'?
All right?

976
01:23:48,772 --> 01:23:50,747
There you go.
- Oh.

977
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:57,122
Thanks, Billy.
- Yeah, all right.
It's just old stuff from the van.

978
01:23:57,218 --> 01:24:01,406
No, I mean,
thanks for gettin' me out.

979
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:03,805
Oh, that's all right.

980
01:24:03,904 --> 01:24:07,248
Hey, you should get out more often.
- Heh!

981
01:24:15,613 --> 01:24:18,712
W- Why did you want to come down here?

982
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:21,941
My dad used to bring me here.

983
01:24:23,194 --> 01:24:25,113
Listen to concerts.

984
01:24:29,143 --> 01:24:31,062
LV, uh...

985
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:36,851
There's people other
than your dad who, well,

986
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:39,402
other people who...

987
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:42,547
...who might think
something of you, and, ah,

988
01:24:42,643 --> 01:24:46,569
other people who are,
well, still alive.

989
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:52,102
Billy. I've got to go.

990
01:24:52,206 --> 01:24:54,125
Oh!
- LV?

991
01:24:56,269 --> 01:24:59,684
Didn't handle that very well.

992
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:24,708
What's happened here,
then, little match girl?

993
01:25:24,804 --> 01:25:27,985
The little stick who wrecks everything.

994
01:25:28,929 --> 01:25:32,224
I can't start again,
can I, now?

995
01:25:32,321 --> 01:25:35,483
Who'd want me anyway,
hmm?

996
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:37,886
Who'd want me?

997
01:25:39,519 --> 01:25:42,333
Wait a minute.

998
01:25:43,677 --> 01:25:46,492
What do you want,
anyway?

999
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:50,548
Oh, I know. Your records.

1000
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:55,122
Well, all salvage
crap's out on back roof, LV, love.

1001
01:25:56,665 --> 01:25:58,584
Maybe they'll be there.

1002
01:26:26,605 --> 01:26:29,540
What's up?
Cat got your tongue?

1003
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:39,146
Can you hear me now, Mother? My dad...

1004
01:26:39,243 --> 01:26:44,477
You drove him as fast
as you could to an early grave!

1005
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:48,260
With your men and your shouting...

1006
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:51,555
...and your pals and your nights...

1007
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:53,892
...and your nights and your nights...

1008
01:26:53,989 --> 01:26:56,453
...and your nights and your nights
and your nights...

1009
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:58,850
...of neglect!

1010
01:26:58,946 --> 01:27:01,402
Ohh.

1011
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:06,207
When he had his records on,
he sparkled.

1012
01:27:07,265 --> 01:27:09,239
Not dazzling, like you,

1013
01:27:10,303 --> 01:27:13,238
but with fine lights.

1014
01:27:13,343 --> 01:27:15,262
Fine lights.

1015
01:27:17,277 --> 01:27:19,284
He never spoke up to ya,

1016
01:27:19,421 --> 01:27:21,868
'cause you would never listen.

1017
01:27:23,995 --> 01:27:26,230
I never spoke up to ya,

1018
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:30,158
Because I could never get a word in!

1019
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,340
Little Voice.

1020
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,106
Me name's Laura.

1021
01:28:37,921 --> 01:28:39,904
Everything all right then?

1022
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,934
Fine. Is that Duane?

1023
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,816
Aye. Just about back
to normal now, I reckon.
- Yeah.

1024
01:28:46,912 --> 01:28:49,725
I think I know how he feels.

1025
01:28:53,756 --> 01:28:56,285
Do you want to give me an 'and?

1026
01:28:57,372 --> 01:29:00,568
With exercise?

1027
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,585
Yeah.

1028
01:29:03,544 --> 01:29:05,464
All right.

1029
01:29:05,464 --> 01:29:07,896
Let's fly! Come on.
Let's go for a fly.

1030
01:29:07,992 --> 01:29:10,957
Shoo! Shoo, fly. Fly.
- Go on, up!

1031
01:29:11,062 --> 01:29:14,258
Up you get.
Come on. Come on.
