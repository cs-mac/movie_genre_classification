1
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:04,831
How would you like to have
your goddamn rig impounded?

2
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,131
Sorry, Officer. My hand slipped.

3
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:30,683
You better get ready
to hock your tricycle, Jack.

4
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,919
Yeah? Let's see your money, big mouth.

5
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,830
- $200 on Philo!
- You're covered!

6
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,384
I'll go handle this.

7
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,063
$1,200.

8
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:44,027
$1,200.

9
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,533
$50 on Philo.

10
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,534
What's your name?

11
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,007
- $1,200 more on Philo!
- You're covered!

12
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:57,735
You know,
we're covering over $8,000 so far.

13
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,645
We'll eat him for breakfast.

14
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,482
Hell, Joe whipped every Marine
in the 1st Division.

15
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:06,619
He ain't a Marine.

16
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:15,630
- Jesus, he's big.
- Yeah, he's sizeable.

17
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,656
They said he beat everybody
in the Marine Corps.

18
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,929
I ain't a marine.

19
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,432
I got $2,800 from the boys in Bakersfield.

20
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,436
You're covered.

21
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:33,176
You lose this fight, we'll be patrolling
Death Valley for the next five years.

22
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:36,611
Don't worry about it, Sarge.
Eat him up, Joe.

23
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,220
Eat him up.

24
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,919
Take care of Clyde, will you?
You know he likes to crap in squad cars.

25
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,737
Hey, hold it.

26
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:46,346
Okay, Joe. All right!

27
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:06,000
He's killing him!

28
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,511
He's moving pretty good for a corpse.

29
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,261
Bingo!

30
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,530
All right. That's it.

31
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:49,471
- He ain't down yet.
- He ain't and I ain't putting him down.

32
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:52,173
If you want to take his place,
we can arrange that.

33
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,840
- Fight ain't over till he's down.
- Shut up.

34
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,855
Great. You got him.

35
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,824
- How much we pull down?
- $1,200.

36
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,792
Where's Clyde?

37
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,362
- Shit.
- There.

38
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,011
Clyde, you got damn little respect
for the law.

39
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,789
Sergeant Smith.

40
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,077
This is going to be my last fight.

41
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:58,845
How come?

42
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:00,608
Right turn, Clyde.

43
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,583
I'm getting to like the pain.

44
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:15,729
- Well, I guess it's time, then.
- Yeah, I think.

45
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,935
I don't understand it.
I whipped every marine in my division.

46
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,005
- Some real tough guys.
- Jesus.

47
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,240
How can you stand the stench?
I can't smell nothing.

48
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,576
The Captain won't really transfer us,
will he, Sarge?

49
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,380
Seeing as we flushed $2,800
of his hard-earned bucks...

50
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:41,613
...it's Death Valley, son, believe me.
- Some real tough guys.

51
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,763
- Pull those guys over! They're littering!
- Shut up, will you?

52
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,654
Pardon me, sir, was that $3,000?

53
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,200
No, it is not $3,000.

54
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:30,633
Mr. Paoli bets $30,000 on the challenger?

55
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:18,820
- That's it!
- He never touched him!

56
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,420
Your animal's going to be dead
in 15 seconds.

57
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,727
Gentlemen.

58
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,821
Keep your terrier in his cage, Beekman.

59
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:32,163
Junior, he is only looking out
for my interests, that's all.

60
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:37,563
- Your money will be here by 5:00 p.m.
- I expected no less.

61
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:57,820
- Did you set up a fight for Wilson?
- Not yet.

62
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,890
Come on.

63
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:03,622
What the hell am I paying him
$5,000 a month for, to sit on his hands?

64
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,291
Nobody will take him on.

65
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:07,994
Not after what he did
to those last couple of guys.

66
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,873
Maybe we ought to set up a match
between Wilson and the rattler.

67
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,471
You would lose a good rattler.

68
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:20,141
There is a guy on the West Coast
named Philo Beddoe.

69
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,139
Philo Beddoe.

70
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,748
- I never heard of him.
- Some folks from Dallas think a lot of him.

71
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,721
Yeah? Which folks?

72
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,452
The folks that bet.
And he's well-known in California.

73
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:33,552
I think we could get a good piece
of action on this one, Jim.

74
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:39,191
- All right. You set it up.
- All right.

75
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,977
Well, Loretta, we've talked about it
for 20 years, but now we're doing it.

76
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,810
We're in California.

77
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,850
I hear people here are a little peculiar.

78
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:01,819
Loretta, folks are just folks the world over.

79
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:10,789
- Luther.
- Yeah?

80
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,400
I think we should go back to lowa.

81
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:57,172
- You didn't tell me she was here.
- I didn't know. We can go.

82
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:30,828
Do you mind if I sit here?

83
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:34,331
No. It's a free country.

84
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:37,607
You're still mad at me, I guess.

85
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,312
No, I like having my guts kicked out.

86
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,452
I didn't mean to hurt you. I was mixed up.

87
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,421
- What do you think I was?
- I'm sorry.

88
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,919
That's in the past.

89
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,062
Yeah, it sure is.

90
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:01,859
Do you want me to leave?

91
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:04,864
Yeah.

92
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,485
All right, Clyde, keep your pants on.
I'm coming.

93
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,499
I knew you and Philo came in here a lot.

94
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:43,844
So, I told them I'd sing for nothing
just to get a chance to talk to him.

95
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,544
I guess I shouldn't have bothered.

96
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,915
- I don't like drinking with filthy apes.
- Clyde is a clean ape.

97
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,113
I'm going to kick his ass out of here.

98
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,024
If I was you, friend, I'd sit back there
and I'd have myself another beer.

99
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:03,154
- You ain't me.
- No.

100
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,503
- I'll have another beer.
- Right.

101
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:17,033
Looks like Clyde's getting a little rowdy.
We better get out of here.

102
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,084
You're getting rowdy, Clyde.

103
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,516
- You should leave Philo alone, honey.
- I'm not your honey.

104
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:36,598
Listen, he was down for two months
after you pushed him over.

105
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:38,624
So was I.

106
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:44,030
The three of us are doing fine now.
Why don't you just leave him alone?

107
00:18:56,952 --> 00:19:00,410
Clyde, leave the bananas alone. Come on.

108
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:06,090
Kind of grows on you, doesn't he?

109
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,241
We are the Black Widows!

110
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,514
Who stomped a mudhole in you?

111
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,823
Philo Beddoe!

112
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,858
Then spat on you,
and let his ape stomp it dry?

113
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:42,954
Philo Beddoe!

114
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:46,528
So, whose hide are you going to nail
to the gates of hell?

115
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,258
Philo Beddoe's!

116
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:52,467
All right, then, let's start doing
some stomping of our own.

117
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:53,833
Yeah.

118
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:56,906
Good grief, my brownies are burning.

119
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,818
- His what?
- He's baking brownies.

120
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,494
Why me, Lord?

121
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:20,168
I mean, you made other men out of clay.

122
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:23,537
Mine, you made out of shit.

123
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:32,376
- I should have expected it.
- Expected what, Ma?

124
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:38,410
Quitting your job, letting an old lady
die of frostbite, canker sores.

125
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:44,187
- It ain't froze around here in 30 years, Ma.
- Don't have to freeze.

126
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,857
I got thin blood.

127
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,955
Besides, I didn't quit my job.
Fighting ain't my job.

128
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:55,126
I have to admit, it ain't much.

129
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,906
But it's the closest you've come
to earning a decent living.

130
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:05,276
But, hell, you don't care about keeping
a roof over a poor, helpless old lady's head.

131
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,677
You don't care if she has to eat dog food.

132
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:11,617
You don't care
if she has to soak her teeth in Clorox.

133
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:17,915
Come back here with my Oreos,
you hairy ass!

134
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:29,031
- I'm looking for Mr. Philo Beddoe.
- You're talking to him.

135
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:33,835
- I'm talking to his feet.
- Well, the top half of him can hear you.

136
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,707
I represent a man
who would like to back you, Mr. Beddoe.

137
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,274
See that crescent wrench up on top there?

138
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:43,576
- Yes, I see it.
- Why don't you hand it to me?

139
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:46,621
Tail first, of course,
because the jaws might be venomous.

140
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,282
Thanks.

141
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,625
- Back me at what?
- A fight?

142
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,192
- Sorry, I'm retired.
- Since when?

143
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,765
Since I decided to retire.

144
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:05,230
My employer is willing to pay you
$15,000 for this fight, Mr. Beddoe.

145
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,671
- Against who?
- A man named Jack Wilson.

146
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,049
- You know Wilson?
- I know of him.

147
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,948
Let's not quibble, Mr. Beddoe. $25,000.

148
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:31,089
- Is that win or lose, or just win?
- The money will be payable, win or lose.

149
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:35,302
$10,000 in advance.

150
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,232
- Give it to Clyde.
- Yes.

151
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,040
- Who's Clyde?
- He's my manager.

152
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:46,814
Jesus Christ!

153
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:51,914
- Don't worry, he won't hurt you.
- You want me to give $10,000 to an ape?

154
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:56,123
He handles all my business.
You stash that and don't let Ma see you.

155
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:57,847
Good boy.

156
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:12,532
I'll be in touch.

157
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:15,239
Yeah, I'm sure.

158
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,873
- <i>You there</i>, <i>Harry?</i>
- <i>Yeah</i>, <i>what do you got?</i>

159
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,082
<i>Dead battery at Sunset and Lincoln.</i>

160
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:25,948
- <i>Green '73 Chevrolet.</i>
- <i>Got it. Be about twenty minutes.</i>

161
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:32,884
Twenty minutes is too late by half, Harry.

162
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:47,533
Hang on, green Chevy. Harry's on the way.

163
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:52,977
Have you seen Clyde?

164
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:55,683
No. Is he gone?

165
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:57,813
A couple of hours.

166
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:02,580
- Is he in the shed?
- I'll take another look.

167
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:08,393
No hairy-ass jungle jumper...

168
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:11,193
...is going to outsmart Zenobia Boggs.

169
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:17,427
That goddamn banana-head probably ate it.

170
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:18,996
Send him down to that...

171
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:25,403
Work and slave for that ape of yours.
Work and slave.

172
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:29,842
I appreciate that, Ma.
You haven't seen him, have you?

173
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:32,382
No, I ain't seen him.

174
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:41,824
I'll find it. You better believe I'll find it.

175
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:17,014
- Have you seen Clyde?
- Yeah. Right behind you, Philo.

176
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:34,067
<i>Lynn Halsey-Taylor</i>, <i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

177
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:36,940
<i>Now</i>, <i>let's everybody get ready</i>
<i>for Fats Domino.</i>

178
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,004
He ain't supposed to be out like this.

179
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,832
What did I do?

180
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:09,672
I was just singing a number
and he came in and sat down.

181
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,037
He probably got lost
and recognized this place.

182
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,476
Maybe he wanted to see me.
Not everybody hates me, you know.

183
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:21,514
I don't hate you.

184
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:27,184
I can take just about any kind of pain.
There's just one I have no tolerance for.

185
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,121
Some kinds I can't tolerate either.

186
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:41,532
You got to do another set?

187
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:46,472
No, I'm just doing one set a night.
They're all here to see Fats.

188
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:48,311
- You sound good.
- Thank you.

189
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,405
Real good.

190
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,198
Do you have any wheels?

191
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:08,436
No.

192
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:11,929
I'll give you a ride home. If you like.

193
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:14,902
I like.

194
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:47,742
This is it?

195
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,710
- Anything wrong with it?
- No. Not a thing.

196
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:56,010
- Well, I guess I can't ask you in.
- I guess not.

197
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,785
Good night, Clyde.

198
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,224
Thanks, Philo.

199
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:36,947
Shut up, meathead.

200
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:45,997
It's Philo Beddoe!

201
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:50,670
- Are we bad mothers?
- We are bad mothers!

202
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:14,290
Hey, Beddoe, it's us.

203
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:19,124
Are you talking to me?

204
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,931
I ain't talking to you, Beddoe.
I'm reading your death warrant.

205
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,365
I didn't know you boys could read.

206
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,441
Now that's real cute, real cute.

207
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,603
We're going to kill you slow, boy.
It will take maybe a week.

208
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:36,080
Well, I wouldn't want to rush you.

209
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:42,087
First day, you'll probably be shaking
like some blind faggot at a weenie roast.

210
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,884
You got him real good, Cholla,
you got him real good with that one.

211
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:49,389
Shut your hole!

212
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,737
Except this time,
it ain't going to be no weenie roast.

213
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:00,603
No, this time it's going to be an ape roast!

214
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,971
Right turn, Clyde.

215
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:21,326
Cholla, they're getting away.

216
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:24,787
Why me?

217
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:32,703
What the hell.

218
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:35,771
I guess maybe it's time.

219
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:45,811
She's in Room 25,
but you can't go up there.

220
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,621
No, ma'am, I know that.

221
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,851
- You are not allowed up there!
- I won't be long, ma'am.

222
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:59,127
Operator, get me the police.

223
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,595
Excuse me, ma'am.

224
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:07,267
Wait a minute.

225
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,573
Excuse me, ma'am,
I didn't see a thing, hardly.

226
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:13,136
- You aren't allowed up here!
- I know that, ma'am.

227
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:18,509
- Who is it?
- Philo.

228
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,345
You're not allowed up here.

229
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,918
That must be true.
You're the third person who's told me that.

230
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,562
Well?

231
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,164
Well, we've got an extra room
at the house.

232
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,198
I don't need any handouts.

233
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:43,368
Handouts you get from the government.
A hand up is what you get from friends.

234
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,705
Are you a friend?

235
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:47,338
I'm a friend.

236
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,015
Well, I don't have so many friends
that I can afford to lose one.

237
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,193
What is it?

238
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:08,802
Sorry, ma'am.

239
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:23,951
What we got here, ladies,
is a case of wishful thinking.

240
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:27,920
They all think we moon around all day,
lusting after their bodies.

241
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:30,152
Some of us do, Rita.

242
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,614
Where's Clyde?

243
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:06,515
Shit.

244
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:13,060
- How are you gonna write this one up?
- I'm not. But you were a lot of help.

245
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,763
You can always say she was nuts
about your toothpaste smile.

246
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:22,342
You could bust them
for harassing an officer.

247
00:34:22,443 --> 00:34:23,603
Just shut up.

248
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:28,041
It's them!

249
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,524
- Come on, we can catch them!
- You catch them.

250
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:53,904
- So, where are you going to sleep?
- We got a guest room out back, I told you.

251
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,600
- Good night.
- Good night.

252
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,263
Clyde, you still up?

253
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:42,214
What are you doing, pal?
An Oreo cookie for me?

254
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:46,080
I'll save mine till later.

255
00:35:56,932 --> 00:35:59,958
- Mind if I come in?
- No, not at all.

256
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:10,267
What was that?

257
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:14,675
Just a cookie I was saving till later.

258
00:36:16,352 --> 00:36:19,947
Well, never mind.
You can have me instead.

259
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:23,991
No looking now.

260
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,132
We chased him away.

261
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:11,834
Fresh air's good for him.
Besides, he'll guard the door.

262
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:14,401
Is he reliable?

263
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:18,742
Anything that gets past Clyde
is 40 feet high with fangs.

264
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:24,051
- I think we're safe.
- I think.

265
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:28,584
I think I love you.

266
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:33,352
I think that's a piece of luck for me.

267
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:56,876
Philo?

268
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:01,913
Jordan said he'll give us $200
if we scrap that Merc for him.

269
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:05,218
Great. Clyde, scrap the Merc.

270
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:09,114
Clyde, you got work to do.

271
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:10,482
Mind if I jog with you?

272
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,887
Hell, no.

273
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:19,516
We must be three miles out.
How much further before you turn back?

274
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:21,489
A couple more.

275
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:24,121
That's ten miles round trip.

276
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:28,095
- You do this every day?
- More or less.

277
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:33,131
I'm not sure I'm gonna make it.
I'm kind of new to this physical stuff.

278
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:36,270
You're doing real good.

279
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:39,948
Thanks.
The doc said I had to get some exercise.

280
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:43,444
All I do is sit behind a desk all day.

281
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,515
You sit behind it, or you carry it around?

282
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:51,124
Well, I play a little squash sometimes.

283
00:41:02,137 --> 00:41:04,731
- You look like you do some lifting.
- A little.

284
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,137
- Mostly engine blocks.
- That'll do the job.

285
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:14,279
- Careful of that soft shoulder, there.
- It's a hell of a drop.

286
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:00,188
You got a pretty good grip for a new guy.

287
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,261
There's a lot of strength in fear.

288
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:08,594
- Believe I owe you.
- I believe you do.

289
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:18,274
- You can't do this fight.
- Why not?

290
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,072
I've been checking with some people
and I found out who Jack Wilson is.

291
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:26,478
Look, the fight will get us a new truck,
a new roof, and a few extras for Ma.

292
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:29,749
- He killed two men last year.
- One.

293
00:42:30,993 --> 00:42:35,054
The other one's lying someplace with
nothing below the neck but memories.

294
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,227
I told them I was going to do it.

295
00:42:37,466 --> 00:42:40,230
I know I don't have much influence
with you anymore...

296
00:42:40,302 --> 00:42:43,669
...since you got a girlfriend.
But damn it, Philo, you can't do this!

297
00:42:43,872 --> 00:42:45,169
Well, I'm going to do it.

298
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,176
Don't go telling Lynn about Wilson now,
you hear?

299
00:42:50,412 --> 00:42:51,401
Damn.

300
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:03,120
Move over, Clyde.

301
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,457
Looks like both of us are getting aced.

302
00:43:26,214 --> 00:43:28,307
- A friend of yours?
- Yeah.

303
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:32,581
Nice voice. Nice style.

304
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:34,978
I think so.

305
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:49,097
Why don't you get somebody who can sing
around here?

306
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:54,373
- That's not polite.
- Forget it.

307
00:43:56,545 --> 00:43:58,877
The complaint department
is open now, sonny.

308
00:45:08,784 --> 00:45:11,378
- You play a hell of a game of squash.
- So do you.

309
00:45:12,788 --> 00:45:15,757
- I believe that makes us even.
- I believe it does.

310
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,422
Find out what you want to know?

311
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:20,885
Yeah, I did.

312
00:45:21,563 --> 00:45:23,463
You're fast and you like pain.

313
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,327
You eat it like candy.

314
00:45:27,736 --> 00:45:30,227
I've seen a few cases like that in my time.

315
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:33,608
The more they get hurt,
the more dangerous they become.

316
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:38,010
But you got to be durable, too.
Real durable.

317
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:40,842
Most ain't.

318
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:44,141
You're right. Most ain't.

319
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,688
Let's call this fight off.
There's no point to it.

320
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,883
I ain't doing it for points.

321
00:45:55,597 --> 00:45:58,964
You're good, but you're not good enough.

322
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,442
I don't want to hurt you,
and that's the truth.

323
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:13,410
Sometimes we can't always do
what we want to do. Right?

324
00:46:15,517 --> 00:46:17,075
Your money's no good here.

325
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:20,519
Thank you.

326
00:46:22,424 --> 00:46:25,450
- Pleasure watching you work.
- Same here.

327
00:46:32,934 --> 00:46:34,026
Who was that?

328
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:40,232
That was a friend of mine.
We used to play squash sometimes.

329
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:21,482
I don't want you to fight.

330
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:26,387
You, too? I thought you weren't
supposed to say anything to her.

331
00:47:26,855 --> 00:47:28,948
I thought she would have more influence.

332
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:32,190
Don't do it, Philo.

333
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:35,491
- I'm doing it, and that's the end of it.
- But he kills people.

334
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:37,758
The subject ain't open for discussion.

335
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:42,997
Go ahead, get yourself killed,
you selfish lunkhead.

336
00:47:43,605 --> 00:47:44,902
Better still.

337
00:47:45,507 --> 00:47:49,671
Let him scramble your brains
and turn you into a turnip...

338
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:53,646
...so I can spend the next 20 years
watering you.

339
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:58,109
You, too?

340
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,848
All right. Clyde, go get the money.

341
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:06,416
Go ahead.

342
00:48:09,164 --> 00:48:10,153
Orville.

343
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:15,102
Here's the card. Call that guy and tell him
to come and get his dough.

344
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:30,845
Under my own mattress. Humiliating.

345
00:48:31,152 --> 00:48:34,349
Outsmarted by a banana-head.

346
00:48:39,861 --> 00:48:43,092
I spent the last five hours
on a very bumpy airplane, Mr. Beddoe.

347
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:44,893
I'm not in a good mood.

348
00:48:45,934 --> 00:48:48,835
- I don't blame you.
- We have a deal, Mr. Beddoe.

349
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,062
We had a deal.
Clyde, get the man his money back.

350
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:55,199
One does not cancel deals
with James Beekman.

351
00:48:56,177 --> 00:49:00,045
One takes one's money back,
or else Clyde gets bugged at one.

352
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:02,049
I am holding it for you, Mr. Beddoe.

353
00:49:02,384 --> 00:49:06,081
I will add $15,000 to it and give it to you
when you show up for the fight.

354
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:09,180
Bear this in mind.
What Wilson will do to you is nothing...

355
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:12,818
...compared to what we will do to you
if you don't show up for the fight.

356
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:15,427
Clyde, escort the man out.

357
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:20,366
- You'll have a visit from my friends soon.
- Will they be driving Cadillacs, too?

358
00:49:20,535 --> 00:49:23,026
Yes. Long and black.

359
00:49:23,104 --> 00:49:25,595
Clyde, scrap the Caddie.

360
00:49:29,244 --> 00:49:30,233
Jesus!

361
00:49:57,105 --> 00:49:57,935
Jesus!

362
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:21,853
Oh, God!

363
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,560
He's crazy.

364
00:50:39,214 --> 00:50:42,615
How about we go up to Bakersfield
and mess around for a couple of days?

365
00:50:42,684 --> 00:50:46,120
No, thank you. I'm not Clyde.
I can't sit around eating bananas...

366
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:49,683
...while you and the broad
are playing patty cake.

367
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:53,017
- She's not a broad.
- I know that.

368
00:50:54,996 --> 00:50:56,657
Damn it, I'm just talking mad.

369
00:50:56,731 --> 00:51:00,189
You're allowed to talk mad to your friends,
you know, if they are.

370
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,733
They are, and you're allowed.

371
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:07,939
Shit.

372
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:10,738
She's a real nice girl.

373
00:51:11,813 --> 00:51:12,802
I know.

374
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:15,473
- A piece of luck.
- I think.

375
00:51:17,852 --> 00:51:21,686
- But I don't have to like it.
- Hell, no. I wouldn't either.

376
00:51:22,724 --> 00:51:23,816
You wouldn't?

377
00:51:27,896 --> 00:51:30,831
Maybe I ought to get
really mad at you, then.

378
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:38,697
You better go before
he goes down the block again...

379
00:51:38,773 --> 00:51:40,536
...after that lady Saint Bernard.

380
00:51:40,608 --> 00:51:44,374
Jesus, I never saw a dog
turn gray overnight before.

381
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:49,111
That's enough.
Come on, you'll get blasted.

382
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:50,644
Let's go.

383
00:51:51,686 --> 00:51:54,086
- You take care, now.
- All right. You, too.

384
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:15,169
Seems like Orville
is not very happy these days.

385
00:52:15,843 --> 00:52:18,937
I know. I guess he thinks
you're taking up some of his space.

386
00:52:20,114 --> 00:52:23,277
- But I can't give it back to him.
- I know.

387
00:52:32,293 --> 00:52:33,726
Hang on.

388
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:07,221
No!

389
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:29,813
Lock the doors.

390
00:53:50,938 --> 00:53:53,634
Cholla, I'm hardening.

391
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:56,099
I'm hardening, too.

392
00:53:56,477 --> 00:53:58,570
Shut up and get him! Move!

393
00:54:03,384 --> 00:54:04,442
I'm froze.

394
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,416
Dead meat, Beddoe.

395
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:09,245
Dead meat.

396
00:54:15,563 --> 00:54:19,556
You're going to pay for this.
You're going to pay.

397
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,301
What are you going to do with them?

398
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:36,043
Well, we can't leave them here.
Dogs would come along and piss on them.

399
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,649
Ain't fair to the dogs.

400
00:54:38,286 --> 00:54:40,618
You'll pay for that, too, Beddoe.

401
00:54:46,794 --> 00:54:50,821
- Will you be able to get this stuff off?
- Sure. We'll just peel them like bananas.

402
00:54:50,898 --> 00:54:53,890
Of course, that tar will take
most of their hair off with it.

403
00:54:54,268 --> 00:54:55,735
- Painful?
- Moderately.

404
00:54:56,003 --> 00:54:59,234
- Too bad.
- Both of you will pay for this, Beddoe.

405
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:01,871
I already am paying for it.

406
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:07,246
It's $20 for this tow boom
and another $20 I'm adding on...

407
00:55:07,315 --> 00:55:09,840
...for cleaning up my truck.
That's $40 you owe me.

408
00:55:16,224 --> 00:55:18,954
We should be back in 15, 20 minutes,
I hope.

409
00:55:19,026 --> 00:55:22,257
- Good luck.
- Come on, Clyde. Scrap the gate.

410
00:55:35,376 --> 00:55:39,335
Despite your irresistible charm, old buddy,
she may have some reservations.

411
00:55:39,414 --> 00:55:42,247
You just feed her this banana
and that will put her out.

412
00:55:42,316 --> 00:55:43,783
Not more than about 40 minutes.

413
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:47,048
If that doesn't work,
pop her in the ass and squeeze the bulb.

414
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:48,145
Got that?

415
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:02,560
Clyde, sometimes I think
you're not too tightly wrapped.

416
00:56:06,507 --> 00:56:08,338
What happened?

417
00:56:10,144 --> 00:56:13,170
I have the only primate in the country
that's a dope addict.

418
00:56:13,314 --> 00:56:15,214
- Be right back.
- Be careful.

419
00:56:18,286 --> 00:56:21,881
Well, it's his own damn fault
if I get the wrong one.

420
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,457
- Who the hell are you?
- We're looking for Philo Beddoe.

421
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,158
He ain't here. Get out of my house.

422
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:08,500
Who the hell are you?

423
00:57:17,378 --> 00:57:19,278
That ain't him. Where is he?

424
00:57:21,015 --> 00:57:22,607
- Why don't you go...
- Ma.

425
00:57:23,684 --> 00:57:24,651
Where is he?

426
00:57:26,587 --> 00:57:29,385
- Bakersfield.
- Where in Bakersfield?

427
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:31,217
I don't know.

428
00:57:35,296 --> 00:57:37,730
He's going to find a motel
when he gets there.

429
00:58:02,557 --> 00:58:03,956
Son of a bitch!

430
00:58:57,178 --> 00:58:59,408
- Looks like you got the right one.
- Yeah.

431
00:59:51,098 --> 00:59:52,998
Do you think he knows what to do?

432
00:59:54,335 --> 00:59:57,793
Well, there've been primates around
for 80 million years.

433
00:59:58,606 --> 01:00:01,905
I don't think they'd set that kind of record
without doing something.

434
01:00:02,843 --> 01:00:03,867
I guess not.

435
01:00:35,142 --> 01:00:36,541
What is that?

436
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:39,607
It's just Clyde showing off.
It's part of the courtship.

437
01:01:04,271 --> 01:01:06,205
My God. That's obscene.

438
01:01:09,977 --> 01:01:11,308
Sure sounds obscene.

439
01:01:14,749 --> 01:01:18,116
- Don't I get a courtship?
- What do you want me to do?

440
01:01:18,753 --> 01:01:23,622
I don't know. Show off a little.
What do you say, big boy?

441
01:01:34,568 --> 01:01:35,626
How's that?

442
01:01:36,937 --> 01:01:38,234
I'm impressed.

443
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:42,800
Will it hold both of us?

444
01:01:58,626 --> 01:02:00,890
We're leaving this place immediately.
Get up!

445
01:02:10,037 --> 01:02:11,026
Savage.

446
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:24,206
Luther.

447
01:02:29,023 --> 01:02:30,217
Luther, stop that!

448
01:02:32,326 --> 01:02:33,315
My back!

449
01:02:33,661 --> 01:02:38,189
- I've thrown out my back.
- Stretch your arms. Don't tense.

450
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:44,135
Damn fool. I should've known better.

451
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:49,132
It was very brave, Luther.
That was a heavy chair.

452
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:55,915
You looked very impressive.

453
01:02:58,552 --> 01:02:59,917
So did you.

454
01:03:02,056 --> 01:03:03,683
It's been a long time.

455
01:03:54,475 --> 01:03:55,442
How many?

456
01:03:58,779 --> 01:04:00,076
About a hundred.

457
01:04:01,448 --> 01:04:02,415
Let's go.

458
01:04:33,714 --> 01:04:34,942
Bakersfield.

459
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:11,841
Get away from there.

460
01:05:12,052 --> 01:05:16,148
It ain't right to watch folks
go humpity-bumpity.

461
01:05:16,991 --> 01:05:19,459
Hey, baby.

462
01:05:23,897 --> 01:05:26,127
My God, what have I done?

463
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,668
The first live one in 20 years,
and I disabled him.

464
01:05:33,273 --> 01:05:36,071
Come on, sweetie.

465
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:41,540
That was just a little tickle
to loosen you up, you know?

466
01:05:41,615 --> 01:05:46,109
Now, I'll tell you what you do.
You get yourself a good eyeful.

467
01:05:46,186 --> 01:05:49,815
Come on. Just look right in.
Enjoy yourself.

468
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:53,189
And, then when you're ready
for a little romp...

469
01:05:54,128 --> 01:05:55,993
...I'll be in the office.

470
01:06:12,546 --> 01:06:15,447
You know, I ain't a churchgoing person...

471
01:06:15,516 --> 01:06:19,816
...but, I swear,
that's gonna be a thing of a past.

472
01:06:20,854 --> 01:06:22,116
Let him be all right.

473
01:06:22,189 --> 01:06:26,888
I didn't hit him hard,
he should still have one good one left.

474
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,649
Sweetie.

475
01:06:53,387 --> 01:06:54,752
Thank you, Lord.

476
01:07:07,401 --> 01:07:08,368
That's it.

477
01:07:22,483 --> 01:07:25,714
Excuse me, Officer. Can you tell me
where the Pink Cloud Motel is?

478
01:07:25,986 --> 01:07:26,975
Yeah.

479
01:07:27,888 --> 01:07:31,915
Just hang a right out here.
Go down a little bit a ways. Can't miss it.

480
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:40,692
How would you and your girlfriend, there,
like to race me over?

481
01:08:19,106 --> 01:08:20,334
Come on, guys.

482
01:08:50,771 --> 01:08:51,760
Philo!

483
01:08:54,808 --> 01:08:56,571
All right, wise guy.

484
01:08:56,643 --> 01:08:58,770
- Which station?
- Fourth Street. Why?

485
01:08:58,845 --> 01:09:01,336
Fourth Street Station!

486
01:09:06,386 --> 01:09:08,183
What is it, snookums?

487
01:09:08,922 --> 01:09:11,550
Somebody's bashed into our car,
honeybunch.

488
01:09:11,858 --> 01:09:15,794
We can always get another car.
Come back to bed, sweetheart.

489
01:09:25,305 --> 01:09:26,431
What's that for?

490
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,266
Just in case.

491
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:40,215
Take her home. Hurry on back.

492
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:49,588
You wait here.

493
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:19,284
Over this way.

494
01:10:27,901 --> 01:10:28,959
That's enough.

495
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:46,739
Thanks, old buddy.
That took guts. I owe you one.

496
01:11:58,592 --> 01:12:00,184
Don't even think about it.

497
01:12:08,135 --> 01:12:12,003
- How long has she been like this?
- All morning. Ain't said a word.

498
01:12:23,183 --> 01:12:25,378
I suppose you'll have to fight, now.

499
01:12:26,386 --> 01:12:27,216
Yeah.

500
01:12:29,956 --> 01:12:33,949
I don't think they're going to hurt her.
I think they just wanted you to fight.

501
01:12:34,461 --> 01:12:35,393
I know.

502
01:12:36,496 --> 01:12:38,987
- Piece of crap, though.
- Yeah.

503
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,844
She's getting on.

504
01:12:52,746 --> 01:12:57,240
I think maybe her brains are, you know,
turning soft.

505
01:12:58,318 --> 01:13:00,616
Jelly, sonny. Jelly.

506
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:04,815
"Jelly roll killed my mama

507
01:13:05,025 --> 01:13:09,428
"Drove my daddy stone blind"

508
01:13:10,297 --> 01:13:14,028
You're going to church next Sunday.
You, too.

509
01:13:20,974 --> 01:13:22,908
Philo. It's him.

510
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:32,681
Yeah?

511
01:13:32,953 --> 01:13:36,252
Jackson, Wyoming. Saturday, noon.

512
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:38,223
Not until I talk to her.

513
01:13:38,358 --> 01:13:40,485
You are in no position to set conditions.

514
01:13:40,694 --> 01:13:41,683
You heard me.

515
01:13:45,932 --> 01:13:46,899
Nino.

516
01:13:53,139 --> 01:13:54,504
- Philo?
- <i>You okay?</i>

517
01:13:54,574 --> 01:13:56,906
I'm fine.
Don't fight, they don't dare hurt me.

518
01:13:56,977 --> 01:13:59,912
<i>I trust you're not so foolish</i>
<i>as to believe that</i>, <i>Mr. Beddoe.</i>

519
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,072
No, I'm not.

520
01:14:01,147 --> 01:14:04,810
Lynn, the fight's not your concern.
I'll have you out of there on Saturday.

521
01:14:05,118 --> 01:14:06,380
Philo, listen...

522
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:09,811
We have a deal, Mr. Beddoe?

523
01:14:10,123 --> 01:14:13,092
You'll produce her Saturday noon,
before the fight, right?

524
01:14:14,694 --> 01:14:15,683
Deal.

525
01:14:16,963 --> 01:14:21,423
All right, boys. Belly up to the table.
Get yourself some hair there.

526
01:14:21,768 --> 01:14:26,000
Here. Paint on some eyebrows.
You look like a bunch of freaks.

527
01:14:27,774 --> 01:14:31,972
- You promised me a moustache.
- Cholla. You promised I could be a blond.

528
01:14:32,045 --> 01:14:33,774
I want to be a redhead.

529
01:14:33,847 --> 01:14:35,906
- Give me that brown one.
- I like brown.

530
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,846
Cholla, why don't you tell him
to give me what I asked for?

531
01:14:47,294 --> 01:14:48,056
I love it.

532
01:14:52,632 --> 01:14:53,929
Nobody knows nothing.

533
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,436
I checked everybody I know,
even the sleazies.

534
01:14:58,138 --> 01:15:00,732
They're probably holding her somewhere
near Jackson.

535
01:15:01,808 --> 01:15:03,469
We'll just do little scouting.

536
01:16:03,169 --> 01:16:04,158
Jesus.

537
01:16:05,005 --> 01:16:08,668
Why don't you just shut up
and start passing out them tickets, there.

538
01:16:09,542 --> 01:16:10,907
I ain't got the heart.

539
01:16:11,811 --> 01:16:13,301
You've got enough trouble.

540
01:16:14,214 --> 01:16:15,408
Wait a minute.

541
01:16:15,615 --> 01:16:18,482
You have to give us them tickets.
You have to.

542
01:16:18,718 --> 01:16:21,186
I mean, didn't you see us?
We're lawbreakers.

543
01:16:21,321 --> 01:16:23,221
I mean, we are totally despicable.

544
01:16:23,757 --> 01:16:26,248
We have earned them tickets.

545
01:16:26,993 --> 01:16:31,862
Son, you are a walking violation
of the laws of nature.

546
01:16:32,966 --> 01:16:35,093
But we don't enforce them laws.

547
01:16:44,944 --> 01:16:45,933
Lord.

548
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,681
You have given me these crosses to bear.

549
01:16:51,051 --> 01:16:52,541
I will carry them...

550
01:16:52,619 --> 01:16:56,487
...all the way from Jerusalem to Jackson,
whichever is closer.

551
01:16:56,756 --> 01:16:57,882
But hear me, Lord.

552
01:16:57,957 --> 01:17:00,892
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death"

553
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,193
I will chew on Philo Beddoe's ass
for my last supper.

554
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:34,957
I lose.

555
01:17:56,683 --> 01:17:59,846
Excuse me, sir, there's a call for you.
Mr. Beekman.

556
01:18:02,055 --> 01:18:04,455
Hello, Beeky, it's your dime.

557
01:18:04,758 --> 01:18:08,421
Zack? I got a sporting event laid out
for this Saturday.

558
01:18:09,496 --> 01:18:12,761
A fire-eater named Philo Beddoe.

559
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:14,957
Against Jack Wilson.

560
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:17,593
Philo Beddoe? Never heard of him.

561
01:18:18,138 --> 01:18:20,299
Melvin, can Beddoe whup Jack Wilson?

562
01:18:20,907 --> 01:18:24,707
Beddoe's good, real good,
but I'd have to give Wilson the edge.

563
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:26,071
How big an edge?

564
01:18:26,346 --> 01:18:30,544
If it was my money, 7-to-5,
but 6-to-5 is a fair bet.

565
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:34,445
I might be interested in 4-to-1.

566
01:18:34,754 --> 01:18:35,982
Even money, Zack.

567
01:18:36,356 --> 01:18:38,290
Well, I might go 3-to-1.

568
01:18:38,358 --> 01:18:40,292
I've reserved your suite for you.

569
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,788
I'll be there.

570
01:18:47,433 --> 01:18:49,594
You all saddle up. We're going on a trip.

571
01:18:52,138 --> 01:18:55,198
Jim Martin and his crew are coming in
from Kansas City.

572
01:18:56,676 --> 01:19:01,306
We got contingents coming in
from Seattle, LA, Frisco.

573
01:19:01,948 --> 01:19:03,381
Any takers at 6-to-5?

574
01:19:04,517 --> 01:19:06,678
We got about $30,000.

575
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:08,644
You know, Jim...

576
01:19:08,721 --> 01:19:11,519
...we may have to go 2-to-1
to pick up the action a bit.

577
01:19:11,591 --> 01:19:14,025
We'll get enough action at 8-to-5.

578
01:19:14,727 --> 01:19:15,716
All right.

579
01:19:15,962 --> 01:19:18,590
- I'll call up Boston and set up a lay off.
- No.

580
01:19:20,066 --> 01:19:22,864
No. There's not going to be a lay off.

581
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:25,226
Jim.

582
01:19:26,072 --> 01:19:28,700
We could get a couple million dollars
on this fight.

583
01:19:28,942 --> 01:19:30,466
Wilson's not going to lose.

584
01:19:31,578 --> 01:19:35,639
If we try any funny stuff,
they'll retire us to the Jersey Flats.

585
01:19:35,882 --> 01:19:39,249
No funny stuff. I'm telling you,
Wilson's going to take him.

586
01:19:42,188 --> 01:19:43,587
All we've got to do...

587
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:48,927
We set up a little lay off.
We take a nice 6, 7Out

588
01:19:48,995 --> 01:19:51,862
We walk away with $200,000. No risk.

589
01:19:52,031 --> 01:19:54,465
I'd rather walk away with $2 million.

590
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:58,559
Yeah.

591
01:19:58,905 --> 01:20:01,897
All right, I'll go along.

592
01:20:01,975 --> 01:20:04,443
But if Wilson loses,
you better have snowshoes.

593
01:20:05,011 --> 01:20:08,344
Because north of the Arctic Circle
is the only place we'll be safe.

594
01:20:10,116 --> 01:20:14,450
Welcome to Jackson, Mr. Wilson.
It's a great honor to serve you.

595
01:20:14,988 --> 01:20:18,116
I'll take you up to your suite myself.
Here, let me take this.

596
01:20:21,594 --> 01:20:25,587
There are three parties in progress,
one of which started yesterday afternoon.

597
01:20:25,665 --> 01:20:29,999
If there's anything you need, anything.
The hotel does allows pets in the room.

598
01:20:30,436 --> 01:20:32,370
If you understand my meaning.

599
01:20:32,972 --> 01:20:34,564
I don't keep pets.

600
01:20:41,648 --> 01:20:42,945
No pets, no booze.

601
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:46,412
- I can read.
- And no parties.

602
01:20:47,453 --> 01:20:48,818
That's Aunt Hortense.

603
01:20:48,888 --> 01:20:52,153
The last party she was at
was Teddy Roosevelt's inauguration.

604
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:55,791
- Is she your aunt by blood or marriage?
- Blood.

605
01:20:56,529 --> 01:20:59,259
I'd be careful about having any children
if I were you.

606
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,089
Always am.

607
01:21:15,448 --> 01:21:18,679
That's the fifteenth private jet
this morning. What's going on?

608
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:19,945
Bare-knuckle fight.

609
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,279
California boy named Philo Beddoe's taking
on some monster from the East Coast.

610
01:21:24,857 --> 01:21:27,758
- I ain't seen anything in the papers.
- Strictly illegal.

611
01:21:28,127 --> 01:21:31,790
No referee, and the fight won't end
until one or the other's half dead.

612
01:21:35,868 --> 01:21:37,062
Oh, my God.

613
01:21:43,209 --> 01:21:47,270
- I think I'm doing something wrong.
- You're doing just fine, hon.

614
01:21:48,014 --> 01:21:51,108
But we've been flying upside down
for 15 minutes, Zack.

615
01:21:51,184 --> 01:21:55,712
It takes a little time to get the hang of it.
Don't be so hard on yourself, hon.

616
01:21:58,591 --> 01:22:01,253
Like the ride at the fair
where everything falls out.

617
01:22:01,327 --> 01:22:04,353
- I hope so.
- You're terrible.

618
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:07,365
- You can't drink upside down.
- Sure, you can.

619
01:22:09,102 --> 01:22:10,797
- Here, try it.
- All right.

620
01:22:13,506 --> 01:22:14,404
It worked.

621
01:22:14,474 --> 01:22:16,840
You'd be surprised
what you can do upside down.

622
01:22:16,909 --> 01:22:17,898
Surprise me.

623
01:22:21,981 --> 01:22:24,711
I'll take the south side of town.
You take the north.

624
01:22:24,984 --> 01:22:27,248
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know.

625
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:31,757
Keep your eyes out for anything peculiar.
And keep Aunt Hortense out of sight.

626
01:22:54,047 --> 01:22:55,844
Why, you're Philo Beddoe.

627
01:22:56,215 --> 01:22:58,115
- Yes, ma'am.
- It's him!

628
01:22:58,317 --> 01:23:02,549
- He's looking too good.
- Too good by half.

629
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:04,349
Excuse me, ma'am.

630
01:23:04,624 --> 01:23:07,354
We can't get decent odds on you
looking that good.

631
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,825
We're trying to find some fool
who will give us 2-to-1.

632
01:23:10,897 --> 01:23:13,127
Try to look a little more peaky, would you?

633
01:23:14,467 --> 01:23:15,456
Excuse me.

634
01:23:38,491 --> 01:23:40,322
- Sorry.
- You damn fool!

635
01:23:40,393 --> 01:23:42,418
- Let me see that hand.
- What?

636
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:43,792
Wiggle your fingers.

637
01:23:45,665 --> 01:23:48,998
You could have broken that hand
and made paupers out of all of us.

638
01:23:49,902 --> 01:23:50,869
Sorry.

639
01:23:51,337 --> 01:23:54,636
What are you standing here gabbing for?
Get on back to jogging.

640
01:23:56,075 --> 01:23:57,940
- I think I might do that.
- Wait.

641
01:23:58,377 --> 01:24:01,710
No booze, no parties. In bed by 8:00 p.m.

642
01:24:02,548 --> 01:24:03,981
You can count on that.

643
01:24:06,786 --> 01:24:07,775
I do.

644
01:24:09,255 --> 01:24:10,745
Did you all see that?

645
01:24:10,823 --> 01:24:14,884
The way he grabbed me with one hand
like I was a feather?

646
01:24:16,462 --> 01:24:19,625
Son of a gun, boys, we're going to be rich.

647
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,491
We're already rich, Zack.

648
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:31,076
Mind if I jog with you?

649
01:24:32,178 --> 01:24:34,305
You work for some pretty strange folks.

650
01:24:35,515 --> 01:24:37,142
Who I work for is my business.

651
01:24:38,151 --> 01:24:39,311
They got my girl.

652
01:24:40,186 --> 01:24:41,915
They're running together.

653
01:24:43,723 --> 01:24:45,190
Talk about beef on a hook.

654
01:24:48,094 --> 01:24:50,392
- I got $40 on Beddoe.
- You're on.

655
01:24:51,097 --> 01:24:52,291
I didn't know.

656
01:24:52,431 --> 01:24:56,026
I didn't say you did. I just said
you worked for some strange folks.

657
01:24:56,102 --> 01:24:57,967
Well, their business isn't mine.

658
01:24:59,105 --> 01:25:00,367
I never said it was.

659
01:25:02,275 --> 01:25:04,709
We're even, remember?

660
01:25:11,884 --> 01:25:12,873
Jim.

661
01:25:13,452 --> 01:25:15,044
Tony Paoli's on the way up.

662
01:25:17,023 --> 01:25:21,187
- Poor little Tony, he never learns.
- Not junior, senior.

663
01:25:21,627 --> 01:25:23,185
- Big Tony?
- Big Tony.

664
01:25:23,763 --> 01:25:25,492
What is he coming here for?

665
01:25:42,515 --> 01:25:45,211
Mr. Paoli. What a pleasure to see you.

666
01:25:53,826 --> 01:25:56,260
I hear you ain't laying off any of the action.

667
01:25:56,729 --> 01:25:58,754
Not so far, no, sir.

668
01:26:00,433 --> 01:26:03,698
You got guts. I admire a man with guts.

669
01:26:06,872 --> 01:26:11,002
So I says, "Big Tony,
maybe now's the time you go out...

670
01:26:11,077 --> 01:26:14,535
"...and make a little bet with this
high-roller Beekman with guts."

671
01:26:21,721 --> 01:26:23,154
$100,000?

672
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:25,579
Mr. Beekman.

673
01:26:25,992 --> 01:26:29,621
You and I are not men
who deal in five zeroes.

674
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:34,961
- He means six zeroes, Jim.
- "He means six zeroes, Jim."

675
01:26:36,869 --> 01:26:39,303
Of course, I have to cover it.

676
01:26:40,573 --> 01:26:41,562
Of course.

677
01:27:11,103 --> 01:27:13,333
Give us a look, sweetie.
Come on, honeybunch.

678
01:27:13,406 --> 01:27:15,374
Show us those big blue eyes.

679
01:27:29,588 --> 01:27:31,920
He's a menace.
Goes around peeking in windows.

680
01:27:31,991 --> 01:27:35,893
Ogled at me last night while I was
getting it on with two young beauties.

681
01:27:36,762 --> 01:27:38,889
Clyde has no interest in human sex.

682
01:27:38,964 --> 01:27:41,797
What were you doing,
getting it on with a couple of apes?

683
01:27:41,867 --> 01:27:43,596
Get out. Out.

684
01:27:45,838 --> 01:27:46,827
Let's go.

685
01:27:46,906 --> 01:27:48,874
- The fight ain't on till noon.
- I know that.

686
01:27:48,941 --> 01:27:52,741
I found where they're holding Lynn.
Best to hit them when they move her.

687
01:27:52,812 --> 01:27:55,144
- What's going on?
- He found out where Lynn is.

688
01:27:55,381 --> 01:27:56,405
Let's go.

689
01:27:57,116 --> 01:27:59,448
I know they're packing heat
and they might use it.

690
01:27:59,785 --> 01:28:02,310
I'm his friend and Clyde's his friend.
We go.

691
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:07,421
Hop in there, kid.

692
01:28:38,124 --> 01:28:39,284
Right turn, Clyde.

693
01:28:43,996 --> 01:28:45,759
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

694
01:28:46,132 --> 01:28:48,396
Why don't you get the cops
and the ambulance?

695
01:28:48,467 --> 01:28:52,096
- The cops ain't part of the bargain.
- All right, just the ambulance, then.

696
01:28:52,605 --> 01:28:53,936
That bullet was mine.

697
01:28:54,206 --> 01:28:56,697
I like being a hero, too,
sometimes, you know.

698
01:28:56,909 --> 01:28:58,968
Well, you're doing a good job with it.

699
01:29:00,446 --> 01:29:03,210
Look, I just saved you guys' asses
from the slammer.

700
01:29:03,883 --> 01:29:05,441
So now they belong to me.

701
01:29:06,185 --> 01:29:09,086
But if I ever see you again,
I'll come and collect them.

702
01:29:09,255 --> 01:29:14,215
You just get in this car and
keep driving west, until you see the surf.

703
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,753
Got it? Move.

704
01:29:19,331 --> 01:29:22,266
- I owe you one.
- No, we're even.

705
01:29:22,802 --> 01:29:25,635
Your hairy friend back there
saved my skin for me.

706
01:29:26,405 --> 01:29:30,102
- We're even, then.
- You're not going to fight, are you?

707
01:29:30,709 --> 01:29:32,643
Well, if I don't, it's a forfeit.

708
01:29:32,812 --> 01:29:35,645
A lot of people bet money on me.
Not all of them are rich.

709
01:29:35,714 --> 01:29:38,945
If neither one of us showed up,
then there wouldn't be any fight.

710
01:29:39,118 --> 01:29:40,745
Then all the bets would be off.

711
01:29:42,154 --> 01:29:43,985
That's something to think about.

712
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:47,358
Wilson! He hung up.

713
01:29:48,127 --> 01:29:49,958
Well, that's it.

714
01:29:50,863 --> 01:29:52,854
Neither of them are going to show.

715
01:29:52,932 --> 01:29:55,332
- All the bets are off, then.
- Damn it.

716
01:29:55,534 --> 01:29:58,970
I spent a lot of time,
a lot of money setting this thing up.

717
01:30:00,406 --> 01:30:04,638
Well, you better let
the sporting folks know.

718
01:30:05,978 --> 01:30:09,243
- Are you going to fight?
- I don't know. That depends on Wilson.

719
01:30:09,582 --> 01:30:11,277
You want to stay with Orville?

720
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:14,751
On your way out, could you kind of
tell the nurses what a hero I am?

721
01:30:15,888 --> 01:30:18,220
- Why didn't I think of that?
- Is that the hero?

722
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:20,053
That's him lying right there.

723
01:30:22,328 --> 01:30:24,296
You're a good man, Philo Beddoe.

724
01:30:24,597 --> 01:30:25,928
That hurts right here.

725
01:30:30,903 --> 01:30:33,895
- Young man's got a real healthy appetite.
- That he does.

726
01:30:36,509 --> 01:30:38,636
I don't think we can end it even.

727
01:30:41,046 --> 01:30:42,172
I don't think.

728
01:30:44,016 --> 01:30:45,574
But then, on the other hand...

729
01:30:45,651 --> 01:30:48,484
...I don't have any great desire
to make Beekman rich.

730
01:30:50,823 --> 01:30:52,017
Did you figure you would?

731
01:30:53,259 --> 01:30:54,248
I figure.

732
01:30:56,395 --> 01:30:59,762
But then, I guess we'll just have to find out
if I would have or not.

733
01:31:01,667 --> 01:31:02,656
I guess.

734
01:31:08,274 --> 01:31:09,468
Real shame.

735
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:14,577
- It would've been the fight of the century.
- Sure as hell would have.

736
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,455
I blew a $100,000 deal to get out here
for this fight.

737
01:31:24,657 --> 01:31:26,522
Hell, it would have been worth it.

738
01:31:29,962 --> 01:31:31,987
Wilson would have taken him.

739
01:31:32,731 --> 01:31:35,097
- The hell he would have.
- Who cares?

740
01:32:06,599 --> 01:32:07,588
Get up there.

741
01:32:33,392 --> 01:32:34,791
Look at this.

742
01:32:35,961 --> 01:32:36,950
What?

743
01:32:38,831 --> 01:32:39,820
Let me see.

744
01:32:47,573 --> 01:32:49,837
All right, you kids,
what are you doing here?

745
01:32:51,243 --> 01:32:55,304
I said, what are you kids doing here?
Come on. Move back.

746
01:33:04,056 --> 01:33:04,920
It's on.

747
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:07,614
The fight.

748
01:33:08,927 --> 01:33:14,058
Jackson Base, this is Car 2.
The fight is on. Here.

749
01:33:15,367 --> 01:33:18,200
Breaker, 1-9.
This is your good news channel.

750
01:33:18,537 --> 01:33:20,402
<i>It's on! The fight is on!</i>

751
01:33:20,706 --> 01:33:21,968
Did you hear that?

752
01:33:23,842 --> 01:33:26,174
What are you waiting for, dummy?

753
01:33:29,682 --> 01:33:31,741
Aren't you going to have any? Come on.

754
01:33:35,254 --> 01:33:36,243
Yeah?

755
01:33:39,024 --> 01:33:42,152
- Jim, the fight is on. They're fighting!
- What time is it?

756
01:33:43,062 --> 01:33:46,088
- 11:50.
- All bets don't cancel until noon.

757
01:33:46,165 --> 01:33:49,828
That means all bets are still on.
Come on, lets go!

758
01:34:03,515 --> 01:34:04,504
It's on!

759
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:06,317
- What?
- The fight.

760
01:34:24,236 --> 01:34:25,703
It's on. The fight's on!

761
01:34:31,944 --> 01:34:35,641
Hey, Cholla. What are we doing on foot?

762
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:39,576
- I told you. The cops pinched the bikes.
- Yeah, but what for?

763
01:34:40,085 --> 01:34:42,280
Who's head of this outfit anyway,
you or me?

764
01:34:48,093 --> 01:34:49,082
Fighting?

765
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:23,750
Come on.

766
01:35:41,346 --> 01:35:44,645
It's right around the corner,
and we'll be ringside, boys.

767
01:37:22,948 --> 01:37:23,937
Come on!

768
01:37:28,754 --> 01:37:29,743
Come on!

769
01:37:36,261 --> 01:37:39,059
Kill him. You heard me. Right now.

770
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:54,208
Listen up.
That's Beekman's hoods up there.

771
01:37:54,346 --> 01:37:55,779
They're gonna kill Beddoe.

772
01:37:55,847 --> 01:37:58,179
Cholla, that's great.
Let's give them a hand.

773
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,182
You twit!

774
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:02,345
I sold all our bikes and put
everything we had on Beddoe to win!

775
01:38:02,688 --> 01:38:04,053
Cholla, how could you?

776
01:38:04,122 --> 01:38:06,283
We been at war with Beddoe
for over a year.

777
01:38:06,358 --> 01:38:08,952
War is war, but business is business.

778
01:38:09,261 --> 01:38:11,821
If Beddoe losses, we are flat busted.

779
01:38:12,364 --> 01:38:14,457
Hell, yeah, business is business.

780
01:38:14,733 --> 01:38:17,065
Don't you stand there, you freaks,
go get them!

781
01:39:51,296 --> 01:39:52,991
We could end it here, you know.

782
01:39:54,132 --> 01:39:54,996
Even?

783
01:39:56,201 --> 01:39:57,691
No, you owe me one.

784
01:40:02,941 --> 01:40:05,136
- Hey, is it over?
- I don't know.

785
01:40:09,081 --> 01:40:12,175
Think I'd buy that while I'm still standing?

786
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:13,983
No.

787
01:41:06,671 --> 01:41:07,660
It's broke.

788
01:41:11,943 --> 01:41:12,932
That's it.

789
01:41:14,379 --> 01:41:16,404
- No, it ain't.
- That's it.

790
01:41:19,451 --> 01:41:22,147
- His arm's broke.
- Philo broke his arm.

791
01:41:29,394 --> 01:41:32,124
Stop this. It doesn't matter.

792
01:41:33,031 --> 01:41:35,397
- It matters to me.
- Beddoe.

793
01:41:37,002 --> 01:41:37,991
We're even.

794
01:41:46,178 --> 01:41:47,167
I owe you.

795
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:02,786
Come on. Put that spaghetti down.

796
01:43:18,336 --> 01:43:19,769
I knew he would do it.

797
01:43:23,341 --> 01:43:24,831
You get your money's worth.

798
01:43:37,789 --> 01:43:40,417
- Was I out?
- Yeah.

799
01:43:41,192 --> 01:43:43,660
- How long?
- Long enough.

800
01:43:47,799 --> 01:43:48,925
That's it, then.

801
01:43:50,168 --> 01:43:51,135
That's it.

802
01:43:58,276 --> 01:44:02,508
- That was one hell of a fight.
- Better get that arm fixed.

803
01:44:11,423 --> 01:44:14,290
- I think we better get out of here.
- You're right.

804
01:44:30,041 --> 01:44:32,441
He's paying off 30 cents on the dollar.

805
01:44:32,744 --> 01:44:36,202
But he offered us 40 cents
if we promised not to touch him.

806
01:44:42,921 --> 01:44:45,014
- Did you promise?
- Of course.

807
01:44:46,257 --> 01:44:47,485
Good.

808
01:44:48,693 --> 01:44:51,719
Now go back there and kill him.

809
01:44:54,132 --> 01:44:58,535
Hell, Zack, 30 cents on the dollar
isn't gonna pay for the cost of that plane.

810
01:44:59,037 --> 01:45:00,231
It don't matter.

811
01:45:00,305 --> 01:45:03,706
It's worth it to pay for the privilege
of seeing a fight like that.

812
01:45:04,476 --> 01:45:06,068
Sure as hell is.

813
01:45:06,778 --> 01:45:08,370
I should say.

814
01:45:10,014 --> 01:45:12,915
I'm gonna have to call you
on your bloomers, ma'am.

815
01:45:13,218 --> 01:45:16,779
Oh, damn it. Chivalry ain't dead in Texas.

816
01:45:17,322 --> 01:45:18,653
Thank you, ma'am.

817
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:31,564
- What's the matter, who is it?
- Tony's boys.

818
01:45:31,636 --> 01:45:33,536
What are they coming here for?

819
01:45:33,705 --> 01:45:36,697
- What the hell do you think for?
- Yeah, but they promised.

820
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,049
Come on.

821
01:45:58,563 --> 01:46:01,589
Hurry up. Grab the case. Come on.

822
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:10,136
Hey, Beekman, I believe you owe us
another 70 cents on the dollar.

823
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:12,468
Come on, get out of the way, you punks.

824
01:46:12,777 --> 01:46:16,873
You really don't know who we are, do you?
Tell him who we are.

825
01:46:17,081 --> 01:46:20,312
We are the Black Widows.
We are feared throughout the land.

826
01:46:23,288 --> 01:46:25,222
- Jim.
- Let's get the hell out of here!

827
01:46:29,561 --> 01:46:33,122
You see how they lit out of here
when they found out who we were?

828
01:46:33,698 --> 01:46:35,825
Didn't I tell you I'd make you great?

829
01:46:36,935 --> 01:46:40,063
- But we sure got screwed, man.
- Right, Dallas, we got screwed.

830
01:46:46,878 --> 01:46:48,072
Not quite.

831
01:46:49,747 --> 01:46:52,875
And I'd check that case if I were you.

832
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:30,053
I got a telegram from Ma in Bakersfield.
She's at another revival meeting.

833
01:47:31,556 --> 01:47:34,320
What are you going to do,
you going to head back East?

834
01:47:35,493 --> 01:47:36,824
Yeah, I guess so.

835
01:47:37,529 --> 01:47:39,622
California ain't such a bad place.

836
01:47:39,797 --> 01:47:43,392
Well, I'm not all that wild about it.
But I do like the people.

837
01:47:43,935 --> 01:47:45,800
And the music is great.

838
01:47:46,337 --> 01:47:47,668
Thank you.

839
01:47:48,873 --> 01:47:51,774
What about Beekman?
You going to have any problems with him?

840
01:47:51,976 --> 01:47:55,468
Beekman's the one with a problem.
He can't cover the bets.

841
01:48:00,885 --> 01:48:05,754
- Orville, what do you say?
- I'm staying here in Jackson. Medical care.

842
01:48:08,493 --> 01:48:11,189
I love the place and I love the people.

843
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:13,056
Right, Clyde?

844
01:48:13,498 --> 01:48:14,522
Right, Clyde.

845
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:47,463
Hey, Beddoe!

846
01:48:48,066 --> 01:48:49,397
Are you talking to me?

847
01:48:49,734 --> 01:48:52,965
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
We got a little debt to settle.

848
01:48:53,671 --> 01:48:54,467
We do?

849
01:48:58,109 --> 01:48:59,133
$40.

850
01:49:00,078 --> 01:49:02,137
Now, I believe that makes us even.

851
01:49:04,148 --> 01:49:05,342
I believe so.

852
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:09,584
You know, that was one hell of a fight
you put up over there.

853
01:49:09,687 --> 01:49:11,382
I mean, one hell of a fight.

854
01:49:12,023 --> 01:49:14,548
I understand you boys
had a little scuffle yourself.

855
01:49:15,994 --> 01:49:18,053
Yeah, wasn't half bad.

856
01:49:23,768 --> 01:49:26,601
These things don't look bad
when you get them on straight.

857
01:49:28,506 --> 01:49:30,565
No, they look real good.

858
01:49:33,778 --> 01:49:35,109
You take care, Beddoe.

859
01:49:35,847 --> 01:49:37,041
You do the same.

860
01:49:39,283 --> 01:49:40,272
Let's go.

861
01:49:46,924 --> 01:49:50,553
- Are we rich, Widows?
- We are rich!

862
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:06,707
What do we have here?

863
01:50:07,278 --> 01:50:08,711
New girlfriend, Clyde?

864
01:50:15,653 --> 01:50:18,383
Very nice, but we may have trouble
getting you this one.

865
01:50:25,063 --> 01:50:27,088
We'll do what we can, boy.

866
01:50:50,521 --> 01:50:53,012
I thought I recognized you
and your hairy friend.

867
01:50:53,091 --> 01:50:55,787
Because of you,
I'm stuck out here in this steam bath.

868
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:58,694
I'm citing you for speeding
and reckless driving.

869
01:50:58,796 --> 01:51:01,162
What? We were only doing 50.

870
01:51:01,232 --> 01:51:04,793
- I'm impounding this truck for evidence.
- Impounded for what?

871
01:51:05,970 --> 01:51:09,497
Evidence for transporting an animal
without certificates of ownership...

872
01:51:10,041 --> 01:51:11,906
...and certificates of inoculation.

873
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:14,637
Nobody owns Clyde. He's a free person.

874
01:51:14,979 --> 01:51:18,142
The animal goes to the kennel.
The truck goes to the police yard.

875
01:51:18,716 --> 01:51:22,812
I'll be roasting out in this desert
for three years because of you, Beddoe.

876
01:51:22,887 --> 01:51:24,252
You're going to pay.

877
01:51:27,625 --> 01:51:29,092
Right turn, Clyde.

878
01:51:32,697 --> 01:51:33,686
Onward.
