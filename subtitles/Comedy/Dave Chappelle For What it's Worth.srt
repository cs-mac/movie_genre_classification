1
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:33,317
Dude, dude, no, I was, like,
"Yes, we do have nuclear missiles."

2
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,122
And he was all, like, "No, you don't."

3
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,096
And I was all, like,
"Yes, we do. Whatever."

4
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,463
And then I was, like,
"Well, what part of 'whatever'

5
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,195
"do you not get?"

6
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,863
Josh? Josh?

7
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,742
Hey! How many times have I told
you kids not to play ball in this alley?

8
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,510
-Mom !
-Are you all right?

9
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,246
I'm fine. It wasn't a baseball.
There was this thing!

10
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,187
It came from space! It almost hit me!

11
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,782
-A thing came from space?
-Yeah.

12
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,227
You have the biggest imagination, mister.

13
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,787
-But...
-Come here.

14
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,230
-I'm glad you're all right.
-But...

15
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,268
No buts.
It's time to get ready for bed, please.

16
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,362
Here. And don't walk over there
until I pick up that glass, okay?

17
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,444
Awesome.

18
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,730
Knox. Dooley.

19
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,064
Got a report on some kind of fireball
or something like that

20
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,934
over on Liberty Island. Check it out.

21
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,906
No way. A fireball. Cool.
We'll get right on it.

22
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,374
Sarge, can't you get
somebody else to handle it?

23
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:14,903
-Come on, we just pulled an all-nighter.
-I'm so sorry, Mr. Knox. Tell you what.

24
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,814
Lay down in my office,
and then I'll come by with your blankie,

25
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,216
and you can get yourself a nice nap.

26
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,449
Come on, it's gonna be great. A fireball?
How often do we get a call like that?

27
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,323
Do me a favor, okay?
Act like a cop and stop caring.

28
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,640
Oh, my God.

29
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,546
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, are you all right?

30
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,052
Hello? Please don't be dead!

31
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,986
Oh, did you see that?
He came out of nowhere!

32
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,422
It kind of looked
like you sped up to hit him.

33
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,290
I was going for the parking spot!
Oh, my God.

34
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,851
Oh, Jesus!

35
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,657
Are you all right?

36
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,827
Are you okay? Hello?
Please say something.

37
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,771
Oh, my God, his foot!
I'll call an ambulance!

38
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,139
Oh, God.
Please stay alive, please stay alive,

39
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,476
please stay alive, please stay alive.
This is such bad karma from...

40
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,675
-Where did he go?
-I don't know.

41
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,011
Mr. Guy?

42
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,342
-This will take some time.
-Copy that.

43
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,185
<i>All clear.</i>

44
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,711
Repairs underway, sir.

45
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,105
Damage report.

46
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,557
Right Arm, all well.

47
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,292
Left Arm, ready.

48
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,569
-<i>Casualties, Doctor?</i>
-Abrasions, contusions.

49
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,834
Nothing significant, Captain.

50
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,877
<i>Engineering?</i>

51
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,409
Running diagnostics, sir.

52
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,743
<i>Lieutenant Buttocks, what is your status?</i>

53
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,087
Captain, we had a small gas leak.
It was silent, but not deadly.

54
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,225
Well, crew, it seems
our ship has survived the impact.

55
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,826
<i>Actually, diagnostics</i>
<i>are not encouraging, Captain.</i>

56
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,235
This collision was unexpected,
so our impact shields weren't activated.

57
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,036
<i>How long can we operate at full capacity?</i>

58
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:40,477
Forty-eight Earth hours at most.
After that, system functions will fail.

59
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,538
-And our tracking computer?
-<i>Down, sir.</i>

60
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,346
That means we only have
the last known coordinates of the orb.

61
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,788
It can be anywhere within 10,000
square meters of our current location.

62
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,220
No. 2, Options?

63
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,353
We could continue on the mission, sir,
but it's extremely risky.

64
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,024
The prudent course would be
to return to our home planet, Nil,

65
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,930
and repair the ship.

66
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,935
Assemble the crew.

67
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,108
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for
an address by your esteemed captain!

68
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,479
This is it.

69
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,715
This is the moment
that we've all been training for.

70
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,756
We all know what's at stake.

71
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,954
Our planet is on the verge
of a catastrophic energy crisis.

72
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,928
The device we sent to this world
to drain its oceans

73
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:35,434
has been knocked off course
and is lost somewhere in this city.

74
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:39,460
Once it is found and deployed,
the salt from this world

75
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,507
shall power our home world
for ages to come.

76
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:49,009
<i>Without it, our people</i>
<i>will perish in less than one generation.</i>

77
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,572
I will not permit that to happen.

78
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,545
We must succeed.

79
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,384
-For Nil.
-For Nil.

80
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,289
-For Nil.
-For Nil.

81
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,724
Back to your posts.

82
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,289
No. 3.

83
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,026
Do we have sufficient
linguistic information

84
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,465
to help communicate with these natives?

85
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,062
Yes. I tapped into their central
planetary databank, named "Google."

86
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,198
What a frivolous name
for such a vital function.

87
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,641
Well, if you prefer,
there's another called "Yahoo!"

88
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,508
Baffling.

89
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,513
-What about...
-Cultural and historical references?

90
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,448
-Already on it, Captain.
-Good.

91
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,045
-No. 4, is security prepared?
-Yes, sir.

92
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,454
My team can handle any threat
posed by these gargantuan savages.

93
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,584
-Good.
-Initial reports confirm

94
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,820
that draining this planet's oceans

95
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,160
would have
a catastrophic effect on existing life.

96
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:43,793
We have orders, No. 3.
Our entire home world is depending on us.

97
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,564
Agreed.

98
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,971
We should not lament
the fates of these inferior creatures.

99
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,009
If the orb has fallen into their hands,

100
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,740
who knows for what nefarious purpose
they could be using it

101
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,611
at this very moment?

102
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,300
Mom, there's a drunk guy
in the alley again!

103
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,602
-That's him.
-Who?

104
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,436
-The guy I just hit with my car.
-You're kidding. Again?

105
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,942
Oh, I barely clipped that other guy.

106
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,773
Sir, coronal gas readings just spiked.

107
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,371
-The orb must be nearby.
-<i>Hello?</i>

108
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,975
<i>Hello, sir, hi. Hello? Hi, there.</i>

109
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,579
-<i>Hello, sir? Hi, are you all right?</i>
-Contact, everyone!

110
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,680
-<i>Because you just ran off.</i>
-No. 17.

111
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,986
-<i>Return to the ship.</i>
-Copy.

112
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,790
I'm worried. I really feel terrible
about what just happened.

113
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,524
Can I call you an ambulance or something?

114
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,499
Any medical attention for... For your foot?

115
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,960
Your foot.

116
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,506
Our first verbal encounter.

117
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,242
Thank you for your concern.

118
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,437
<i>Thank you for your concern.</i>

119
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,942
It's way too high. More bass!

120
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,414
<i>Thank you for your concern.</i>

121
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,952
Level the frequency.

122
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,788
I'm all better now.

123
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,055
How hard did you hit this guy?

124
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,659
It's time for you to go
to school before you're late, okay?

125
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,789
Mom...

126
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:23,266
See how she squeezes the smaller
one's skull despite his protests.

127
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,168
-<i>Stop! Stop!</i>
-Such brutality!

128
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,172
-Go on. Goodbye.
-Stop!

129
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,538
Hey, safety first. And if those boys
are after you, you tell me!

130
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,669
-I'm calling their parents.
-Okay.

131
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,874
Would you like to come upstairs for
a glass of water, maybe? Anything?

132
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,940
I can help clean you up.

133
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,815
No, thank you. I am fine.

134
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,581
<i>I am in position.</i>

135
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,880
Are you sure?

136
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,592
Okay, but, see, that's not fine.

137
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,528
So, maybe you should come upstairs,
or I can call an ambulance.

138
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,259
Sir, we cannot let her
contact the authorities.

139
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,133
Agreed. We will go in long enough
to put her mind at ease.

140
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,867
Yes, I will accompany you.
Thank you for your hospitality.

141
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,707
<i>Good.</i>

142
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,246
The thing about my car is,
you gotta pump the brakes.

143
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,645
I mean, I just got it back from the shop,

144
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,478
and I'm seriously considering
suing my mechanic,

145
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,484
because that was just crazy
about what happened.

146
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,247
Oh, sorry, right here! Oh, sorry, right here.

147
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,181
-Hey.
-Hey!

148
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,555
-How you doing?
-How are you?

149
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,151
Good. Good timing.
I got something for you.

150
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,493
Three tubes of cerulean blue.

151
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:29,056
-I just ran out.
-<i>Hi. Mark Rhodes.</i>

152
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,035
Why does he thrust his arm towards us?

153
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,334
Probably best to imitate him.

154
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,835
Hi. Mark Rhodes.

155
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,207
Lefty, huh? Hey.

156
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,657
-<i>All right.</i>
-All right.

157
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,226
Okay.

158
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,163
-All right.
-All right.

159
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,600
Okay.

160
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,105
-Thanks again.
-Yeah.

161
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,334
-We're going right inside.
-All right, yeah.

162
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,851
Okay, here you go.

163
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,861
Sorry about the mess.

164
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:35,834
You know, this is sort of
a workspace/home combo thingy, thing.

165
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,133
Right Arm. This is unacceptable.

166
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,179
Sorry! The liquid shifts the equilibrium !

167
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,445
-I still seem to be a bit shaken up.
-Oh, crap.

168
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,136
-There, I feel much better now.
-Oh, good! That is great.

169
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,195
Great news. Good.

170
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,072
So then, you don't need to call
your lawyer, or anything crazy like that,

171
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,340
because that would be just pointless,
wouldn't it?

172
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,973
Good. Oh, I'm Gina, by the way.

173
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,677
Gina Morrison.

174
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,177
And you are?

175
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,448
Three?

176
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,824
This is a list of the most common
names on this planet.

177
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,556
My name is...

178
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,328
-Ming Chang.
-Ming Chang?

179
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,628
Sorry. Sorry, you just struck me
more like a Dave, or something.

180
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,368
Which happens to be my other name.

181
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,842
Dave Ming Chang?

182
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,779
Dave Ming Chang.

183
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,807
Dave Ming Chang. All right, well, Dave,

184
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,946
I feel just terrible about this whole thing,
and I was gonna have some breakfast.

185
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,285
Would you like to join me?

186
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,258
-No, I really have to be going now.
-Are you sure?

187
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,785
I mean, I sort of have a rule that,
when I hit somebody with my car,

188
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,195
I need to make them breakfast.

189
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,696
That was a joke.

190
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,772
So where are you from?
Do you live around here?

191
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,978
Yes, of course. I am just a regular
person from right here on Earth,

192
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,578
just like you.

193
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,348
I just don't get out that much.

194
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,088
Yeah, judging from your suit,
I'd say since about 1978.

195
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,957
Note, all-white apparel is not
as standardized as we thought.

196
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,297
You late for a Bee Gees concert
or something?

197
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,702
The Bee Gees. Barry, Robin and Maurice,
the Brothers Gibb.

198
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,139
Winning ten Grammy awards
and selling over 100,000,000 records.

199
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,370
<i>Oh, you can tell by the way I use my walk</i>

200
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,572
<i>I'm a woman's man No time to talk</i>

201
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,006
<i>Stayin'alive</i>

202
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,613
Wow. That's impressive
love for the Bee Gees, man.

203
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,317
I'm sorry, I had no idea.
You know? Foot in the mouth.

204
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,952
<i>Listen, do you mind</i>
<i>whipping these up for me?</i>

205
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,723
<i>That would be so great. Just a little help.</i>

206
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,254
I'm so used to making breakfast for Josh,
and all he wants is waffles.

207
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,130
Anyway, he's off to school now.

208
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,568
Yeah, I don't know,
he's got these bullies after him right now.

209
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,695
You don't have any kids, do you?

210
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,002
I mean, you don't really seem
like a kid person, but...

211
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,565
Anyway, I just, I try to be there for him,

212
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,474
but I don't really know
how to deal with it, you know.

213
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,743
I'm just doing the single mom thing,
and I'm so permissive of everything.

214
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,580
Oh, my God, I am talking your ear off.

215
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,691
-All is well.
-Okay, why don't you just take a seat?

216
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,249
And I can finish this.

217
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,159
Here, you like ketchup?

218
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,596
-Oh, thank you.
-You're welcome.

219
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,538
Refreshing. I feel much better now.

220
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,911
That's a new one.

221
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,052
Oh, that's our cat, Boris.
I hope you're not allergic.

222
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,888
Are you?

223
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,860
Cats. Here we go, sir.

224
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,230
Boris, what are you up to?

225
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,271
-Captain.
-Yes?

226
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,438
Yes, my husband was
a captain with the Navy.

227
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,814
-I am a captain.
-Really? A captain of what?

228
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,347
I am a captain of crunch.

229
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,996
-Where is your captain now?
-Frank died four years ago,

230
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,327
so it's just me and Josh now.

231
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,163
It's been rough sometimes,
but we're okay.

232
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,602
There is a strength to this one.

233
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,200
Captain, the orb!

234
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,550
Where was this image captured?

235
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,816
<i>That's Josh at school, the science fair.</i>
<i>He always walks around with this thing.</i>

236
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,881
See, he thinks it fell from outer space.

237
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,019
-We must locate the boy.
-We're on it, sir.

238
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,960
729 East 44th Street.

239
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,829
I really have to be going now.
Thank you for the ketchup.

240
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,695
Okay. You know,
the eggs are just another...

241
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,337
That's the closet.

242
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,282
Sorry about hitting you with my car.

243
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,184
A couple of frat punks get drunk,
miss the last ferry,

244
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,453
stick a rag in their bottle of Stoli,
and then, kaboom !

245
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,790
Suddenly, my morning roll in the hay
with Tracy gets canceled.

246
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,387
I think this is explosive residue.

247
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,895
Don't. Don't do this, Dooley.
I see you getting interested in this.

248
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,940
I see that wacko <i>X Files</i> gleam in your eye.

249
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:31,049
That might be the boy, there!
In that group of Earth children.

250
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,112
What structure is this?

251
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,455
It appears to be
some sort of shrine to technology.

252
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,428
This is the best they have to offer?
Their mini-computers are gigantic!

253
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:52,443
And a slamming home page
means more online buddies.

254
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,309
Dude, while you're waiting,
check these out.

255
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,511
Awesome surround-sound headphones.
Seven ounces, left and right quad.

256
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,883
The sound will blow you away.

257
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,516
Is that insane?

258
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,492
It's like the subwoofers
are actually inside your head.

259
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,690
Damage reports coming in
from all parts of the ship, Captain!

260
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,394
Sir! Structural integrity weakening!

261
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,807
We have got to get out of here!

262
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,622
The sign clearly indicates, "Do not walk."

263
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:46,858
And yet, they keep walking
and walking and walking!

264
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,302
Apparently, chaos
is the order of the day here.

265
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,837
Doctor,

266
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,168
is Two all right?

267
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,572
This is a big planet.

268
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,841
There might be contaminants
we've never encountered before.

269
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,040
I'll keep an eye on it.

270
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,704
Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer.

271
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,479
It's the ice cream man!

272
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,284
Ice cream man, over here!

273
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,622
-Ice cream !
-Hey, look, it's the Good Humor man!

274
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,823
It's this suit again!

275
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,923
How in Nil did we wind up
with this wardrobe debacle?

276
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,163
-We must have missed something.
-I can't see how, sir.

277
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,501
We carefully studied the only signal
ever intercepted from Earth.

278
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,408
<i>The plane! The plane!</i>

279
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,173
When we enter the boy's school,

280
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:11,113
we must not draw any
undue attention to ourselves.

281
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,641
Yes, we must rid ourselves
of this inappropriate attire

282
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:19,383
and replace it with clothing that is
the epitome of both hip and now.

283
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,255
Welcome to Old Navy!

284
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,024
-Any ideas?
-Likely a ritual greeting, sir.

285
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,623
Welcome to Old Navy!

286
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,235
-Welcome to Old Navy!
-Welcome to Old Navy!

287
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,103
Welcome to Old Navy!

288
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,766
Welcome to Old Navy!

289
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,607
Welcome to Old Navy.

290
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,846
Welcome to Old Navy!

291
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,647
Welcome to Old Navy.

292
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,388
Can I help you find your size?

293
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,553
I am obviously
the same size as everyone else.

294
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,191
I just meant are you a small, or...

295
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:11,199
I believe he simply wants to know
the dimensions of your clothing.

296
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,574
Yes, you can help me find my size.

297
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,478
Welcome to Old Navy.

298
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,685
Crew, prepare for
an unrehearsed maneuver.

299
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,619
Come on!

300
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,524
-What the...
-<i>Sorry, sir! It won't happen again!</i>

301
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:44,399
I can help you if you'd...
How about I help you take that.

302
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,807
Very...

303
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,006
Yes, this is my size. Welcome to Old Navy!

304
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,850
Excuse me. Do you have a private chamber
where I can try on these garments?

305
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,553
Changing room back there behind hoodies.

306
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,117
Welcome to Old Navy.

307
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,780
Sir, we have arrived at the school.

308
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,950
This can't be right.

309
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:41,794
<i>One singular sensation</i>
<i>Every little step she takes</i>

310
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,428
Apologies, sir.

311
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,902
Apparently we are on West 44th Street.

312
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:55,010
<i>One smile</i>
<i>and suddenly nobody else will do</i>

313
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,310
Let's get out of here. Double-time.

314
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,793
-Hey!
-What do you got here, little freak?

315
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:20,270
-That's mine!
-What do you use it for, playing nerd-ball?

316
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,330
-Whatever it is, it's mine now.
-Give it back!

317
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,842
Or what?
You gonna tell your mommy again?

318
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:27,875
Can I help you?

319
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,437
I am here for the fifth-grade classroom.

320
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:33,040
Okay, all right, you're very late,
but you're here, at least.

321
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,485
It's been a madhouse.
Half the teachers are out with the flu.

322
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,489
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to
throw you to the wolves.

323
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,226
Don't say a word. I will mess you up.

324
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,833
Josh Morrison.

325
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,394
What are you doing here?
Are you the sub?

326
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,804
You would know the sub, loser!

327
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,141
I don't know him !
My mom hit him with her van!

328
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,045
I am Dave Ming Chang, the sub.

329
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,718
What is your name?

330
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,758
-Smellmy.
-Smellmy what?

331
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,588
Smellmy Buttcrack.

332
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,222
I am sure the other Buttcracks
would disapprove of your behavior.

333
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,630
You don't look like a teacher.

334
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,460
<i>I'm going to report you.</i>

335
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,564
-Vaporize the child at once!
-Delay that order.

336
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:35,136
I am indeed your temporary instructor,
which I shall prove to you now. Observe.

337
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,148
Let's teach them something simple,
shall we?

338
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,762
What the...

339
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:03,731
The unified field theory. The ultimate
pearl of wisdom in all of the universe.

340
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,708
Now you are educated.

341
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,108
-What is your destination?
-I'm gonna sharpen my pencil.

342
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,114
Here, let me assist you.

343
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,186
-There.
-Thanks, I think.

344
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,357
Josh Morrison. Come with me.

345
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:30,133
What are you doing here?
You're not really the sub, are you?

346
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,759
You have something that is mine.

347
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:37,797
It is a small spherical device,
2.7 inches in diameter.

348
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,468
How'd you hear about that?

349
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:43,173
And how can it be yours
if it came from outer space?

350
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,478
Are you an alien?

351
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,415
We've been compromised!

352
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,578
I'm just messing with you.

353
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,621
That's very funny.
It's very important that I find it.

354
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,751
Do you know where it is?

355
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,125
Let me guess.
It's, like, top secret or something.

356
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,168
Yes. It is top secret or something.

357
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:08,433
Will you help us, I mean me, find it?

358
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,910
Look, I don't have it anymore.
This jerk took it.

359
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,073
Well, we have to get it back.

360
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,411
-Where is this jerk?
-His name is Rich.

361
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,008
Him and his buddies are
probably headed for the deli.

362
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,883
-Lead and I will follow.
-Okay, come on.

363
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,170
Such disturbing images.

364
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,735
-Rich isn't here.
-Do you know where Rich lives?

365
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,678
No, but sometimes
I run into him in the neighborhood.

366
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,840
Everybody on the floor, now!

367
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,783
Empty the register and no one gets hurt.

368
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:59,822
This planet continues
to reveal its ugly nature.

369
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,620
It deserves its fate.

370
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,789
-I said, on the floor, now!
-I am already on the floor.

371
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,856
Gravity prevents me from floating off of it.

372
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,295
Get down now!

373
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,371
Big mistake, man.

374
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,181
Hey, you have forgotten your weapon!

375
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,125
Dave, wait!

376
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:39,596
<i>That was awesome! I mean, you</i>
<i>totally threw that guy across the room.</i>

377
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,428
I was very fortunate not to be injured.

378
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,402
And the gun.
No normal person could have done that.

379
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,996
Do you have, like,
superpowers or something?

380
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,472
Do you know
what would be very pleasant?

381
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,374
If we were to change
the subject of our conversation.

382
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,878
Did you see
last night's sports competition?

383
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,781
You see? There's another thing.
You talk so weird.

384
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,684
-Come on, tell me, what's your secret?
-I have no secret.

385
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,781
-Oh, yeah? Quick, where are you from?
-I am from right here in this city.

386
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,452
Where exactly? Give me an address.

387
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,920
The Statue of Liberty.

388
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,090
You live at the Statue of Liberty?

389
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,533
Yes, the Ming Changs have lived at the
Statue of Liberty for many generations.

390
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,436
Now, let us locate the orb.

391
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:25,499
Look, I don't know where Rich is now,
but tomorrow's my mom's birthday.

392
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,670
We're going to our neighborhood
street fair. Everybody goes.

393
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,146
I'm sure he's gonna be there.

394
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,946
You know, if you want,
you could come with me and my mom.

395
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,615
Sir, we can't wait until tomorrow.
Our power supply is dwindling.

396
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:43,684
This child is useless.
We must find the orb on our own.

397
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:49,463
I disagree. Without guidance,
we might not find it in time.

398
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:54,002
Contrary to expectations,
Josh has been quite helpful to us.

399
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,562
We will stick with him.

400
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,211
Man, you are awesome at this!

401
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,305
It's like you've got
super video-game powers, too.

402
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,545
-Are you sure you're not a superhero?
-Absolutely.

403
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:12,021
Fine, I give up. I'm just happy to be
able to play with somebody besides Mom.

404
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,081
Interacting with your mother
makes you unhappy?

405
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,922
Nah, I don't mean to complain. She tries.

406
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,691
It's just that Dad was a lot better.

407
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,994
You know, my dad was a hero in real life.

408
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:26,025
-He saved, like, a million people one time.
-That is impressive.

409
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,436
Yeah, we miss him. Especially Mom.

410
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,373
Now she spends all her time
smothering me.

411
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,843
-She cuts off your air supply?
-Josh, I'm home!

412
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,439
Oh, hey! What are you doing back here?

413
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,108
Some guys with a gun
tried to rob the store,

414
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,152
and Dave stopped them
and saved everyone!

415
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,347
-It was awesome!
-What? What gun?

416
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,616
-Mom, Mom.
-Are you all right?

417
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,024
Mom, I'm fine! It was so cool!
Dave just took them out.

418
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,426
Man, I wish I could do that.
But look at me.

419
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,432
I'm the smallest fifth-grader
in New York City.

420
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,664
-You are not small. You are a giant.
-Yeah, right.

421
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,737
Josh, the most powerful force
in all the universe

422
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,406
often comes from the smallest star.

423
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,715
Dave? Would you like to stay for supper?

424
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:24,421
Sir, the longer we're in their presence,
the greater the danger of exposure.

425
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,890
Yes, I will stay.

426
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,031
Good.

427
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,298
Although, if you thought
my driving was dangerous,

428
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,140
wait till you try my meatloaf.

429
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,201
Meat Loaf?

430
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,655
-What are you looking for?
-I don't know.

431
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,316
I'll tell you when I find it.

432
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,054
You know something, Dooley?
We gotta find you a new hobby.

433
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,722
Stevie, please just hold the insult.

434
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:00,855
Please.

435
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,991
Oh, I forgot today
was Arts and Crafts Day.

436
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,390
Dave, would you mind
helping me clear the table?

437
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:44,197
You know, don't worry about it.
I got it. I'm...

438
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,640
This is something I do all the time.

439
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,476
I'm constantly dropping stuff.
Don't even worry about it.

440
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,849
<i>"Men Are from Mars,</i>
<i>Women Are from Venus."</i>

441
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,653
Yeah, that's my...

442
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:00,748
I would... My sister got that for me.
I would never...

443
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,252
She just thinks I need
to get back in the game, and...

444
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:07,186
Tell your sister there is no life on Mars!
Believe me.

445
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,865
Okay.

446
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,106
This rendering. What is it?

447
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:25,141
That's just something I felt.

448
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,210
-You felt this.
-Yeah, I did.

449
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,822
I did. I don't really paint like that anymore.

450
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,359
And why not?

451
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,487
Well, things have changed.

452
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:48,170
And what is the feeling
demonstrated here?

453
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,942
Well, how does it make you feel?

454
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,173
Feel?

455
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:04,153
It makes me feel off-balance.

456
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,053
Off-balance, yeah.

457
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,614
That's... That's close.

458
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:12,686
I remember when I painted this,
I just felt love.

459
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,231
Huge and exciting and crazy,

460
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,290
just love.

461
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:27,769
How do you know when you feel love?

462
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,179
<i>Oh, I think when you feel love,</i>

463
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,146
you don't need to ask that question.

464
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,345
I see.

465
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,765
Time for me to exit into the night.

466
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,460
Okay.

467
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:55,528
Well, thank you again
for being there for Josh today and...

468
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:00,538
And, yeah, I think tomorrow will be fun.
I'm glad you're coming with us.

469
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,602
So am I, Gina Morrison.

470
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,305
Okay.

471
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,545
-Good night, Dave.
-Good night, Gina.

472
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,630
Do you mind if I rest here?

473
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,296
Sure.

474
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:34,176
This appears to be a safe port.
We'll join this urban camper.

475
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,475
You ain't crazy, are you?

476
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:45,181
The last guy was here,
he said he was from outer space.

477
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,390
What planet?

478
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,751
And the party continues.

479
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,498
Here. Here you go.
Gets a little chilly at night.

480
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,300
Did you see that?

481
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,467
This man has nothing,

482
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,876
yet he offers to share
his sole source of warmth.

483
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,207
Why?

484
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,912
It seems they are a more complex species
than we imagined.

485
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,328
-Yes?
-My findings are incomplete,

486
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,359
but I have noted more atypical behavior
spreading throughout the ship.

487
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,927
Is that so?

488
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,736
Well, I think we all just need
a good night's rest, Doctor.

489
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,066
-Dang!
-Excuse me?

490
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,140
Working rather late, No. 3.

491
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,015
I was just doing
some additional cultural research.

492
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,112
And what have you found?

493
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:29,592
I stumbled onto an interesting file
in the alien database, sir.

494
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,661
Every man, woman and child
is forced to view it once a year.

495
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,397
It could be helpful in understanding them.

496
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,936
Show me.

497
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:45,400
You have not changed
since our days at the Academy.

498
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,206
I remember the late nights
studying together.

499
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,770
And the nutritious protein squares
you prepared for us.

500
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,443
I would not have been able to graduate
without your help.

501
00:40:55,886 --> 00:41:01,017
And, yet, here you've become
our generation's most renowned captain.

502
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,027
Yes.

503
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,220
Here it is.

504
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,870
<i>What is it you want, Mary?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

505
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,500
<i>You want the moon? Just say the word</i>

506
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,272
<i>and I'll throw a lasso around it</i>
<i>and pull it down.</i>

507
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:24,837
<i>Hey, that's a pretty good idea.</i>
<i>I'll give you the moon, Mary.</i>

508
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:25,904
<i>I'll take it.</i>

509
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,299
Lasso the moon?

510
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,244
-Physically impossible!
-Absurd.

511
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:11,320
-Good night, Captain.
-Yes, Three, good night.

512
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:17,126
I must say, sir,
these Earth creatures keep surprising me.

513
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,602
A most confusing place.
It makes my head spin.

514
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,071
I guess I'd better hold on, then.

515
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,217
I want to send this out
to every precinct, every security company

516
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,260
and every hospital in the city
until we ID this guy right here.

517
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:20,729
This is incredible. Just amazing.

518
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,063
Amazing that two idiots like you
could've passed the police exam.

519
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,261
-See? I tried to tell him, Sarge.
-Hold on.

520
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,738
It is a fact, a fact, that something
or someone has landed here.

521
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,901
Now, we could be making the biggest
scientific discovery of all time.

522
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,674
I don't want to hear another word
about E.T., Bigfoot or the Tooth Fairy,

523
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,944
unless they're jacking some old lady's car.

524
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,646
-You got that?
-Yes, sir.

525
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,882
-That's good aim, Sarge.
-Shut up!

526
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:50,288
-Dooley. What are you doing?
-I'm sending it anyway, Knox.

527
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,761
No, it's just a guy
who shoved his face in the dirt.

528
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,593
No, wrong. It is an alien,

529
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,761
an alien who shoved his face in the dirt,
and I am gonna find him.

530
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:16,618
Power reserves at 20% , sir.
That only gives us about 12 hours.

531
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:20,453
Then every minute counts.
Remember our mission, crew.

532
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,823
We must find the boy with the orb.
No distractions.

533
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,618
This is not acceptable!

534
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,426
<i>And here we go, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

535
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:03,728
<i>Chuck starts off fast out of the gate,</i>
<i>eating down those dogs,</i>

536
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:09,068
<i>but Earl and Homer are right behind him.</i>
<i>Look at them go! Look at them go!</i>

537
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,041
-Come on, Dave, eat!
-Dave, just put it in your mouth!

538
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:17,069
-What are you doing? Eat it!
-Just put one in your mouth, Dave!

539
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,906
-Put it in, come on, now!
-Dave! Dave, eat!

540
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,612
You never should have
signed him up for this.

541
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:29,250
-What are you doing, Dave? Eat!
-Eat it, Dave! Put it in your mouth!

542
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,496
Yeah, all right! Yeah! Yeah!

543
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,989
A little heads-up might be nice!

544
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:44,698
Hey! Can a brother
get some hot sauce with that?

545
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,036
Look at him go!

546
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:04,585
<i>Our champion!</i>
<i>Eighty-five delicious all-beef hot dogs!</i>

547
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:05,821
Yeah!

548
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,561
Yeah, boy! Yeah!

549
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,067
Well executed, Captain.

550
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:19,132
Dave, that was amazing!
You are a wiener-eating champ!

551
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,439
<i>And here's the grand prize.</i>

552
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,378
We're under attack!

553
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,146
It's the creature from Thanos 7!
Battle stations!

554
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,814
You have menaced us
for the last time, you beast!

555
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,863
It seems that this is
an inanimate creature.

556
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,105
At ease!

557
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:56,806
The question is, what are we expected
to do with this plush amphibian?

558
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,339
Give it to her, Captain.

559
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,444
The female. Give it to her.

560
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,191
Silly goose.

561
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,721
You are such a goofball.

562
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:25,032
For me? Thanks, Dave. That was...

563
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,167
That's very sweet.

564
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,178
<i>Red alert, Captain! Red alert!</i>

565
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,585
We need to dispose of the large quantity
of processed meat tubes!

566
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,654
Excuse me.

567
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,816
My colon is impacted.

568
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,757
Okay.

569
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,244
Show-off!

570
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,619
Excuse me! Excuse me, we met yesterday.

571
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,165
-Mark Rhodes.
-Mark Rhodes?

572
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,403
-Right. The left again.
-Yeah.

573
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,711
-So, you here by yourself?
-No, I am not.

574
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,845
I am accompanying Josh and Gina.

575
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,891
All evening we have been
screaming with fear and delight.

576
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,018
Look, you and I
should get something straight,

577
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,324
and I'm not trying to
step on your toes, here.

578
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,558
If you're serious about Gina,
then that's great,

579
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,465
because she deserves
a decent guy in her life,

580
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,231
but if I find out that you're just
trying to take advantage of her,

581
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,637
and you're using Josh to do it,

582
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,642
you and I
are gonna have a serious problem.

583
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,610
You understand what I'm saying?

584
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,246
Yes, I understand completely,
Mark Rhodes.

585
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,847
Does anyone here understand
what this man is talking about?

586
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,856
He's trying to discern if you intend
on becoming Gina's mate.

587
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,414
What an absurd notion!

588
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:26,394
I intend on becoming Gina's mate?
She's the size of our science pavilion.

589
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,955
These primitive creatures
and their silly speculations!

590
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,560
Wait! What's that?

591
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,064
-What do you want, midget?
-Rich, you gotta give me my rock back.

592
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,199
Oh, really? Why?

593
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,574
Because it's really important
to me and my friend, Dave.

594
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,078
It's the jerk we seek!

595
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,239
Rich, you've gotta give me my rock back!

596
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,011
Boy, it's like
you're asking me to punch you!

597
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,781
So, Smellmy, we meet again.

598
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,116
Dave.

599
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,461
Stop! You're giving me a wedgie!

600
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,030
Stop! Please put me down, already!

601
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,441
Smellmy, are you crying
because you are sad

602
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,505
or because your undergarments are
lodged so cuttingly deep in your rectum?

603
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,676
I'm telling my mom.

604
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,084
Mom ! Mom !

605
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,120
Dave, that was unbelievable! High-five!

606
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,158
They don't high-five where you're from?

607
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,860
-No, but they should.
-There you two are!

608
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,458
What kind of trouble you getting into?

609
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:44,337
Nothing. Dave was just about
to try out his pitching arm !

610
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,904
-Come on, Dave.
-Go, Dave! Go, Dave!

611
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,505
-You just gotta hit three. Here we go.
-Come on! Come on, come on!

612
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,344
Go, Dave! Go, Dave!

613
00:50:54,518 --> 00:51:01,287
Sir, the orb is ours.
This charade is no longer necessary.

614
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,919
It's time to throw it in the ocean
and head home.

615
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,759
You're absolutely right, Two,

616
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:11,961
but I really think I can do this.

617
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,368
He looks very serious.

618
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,031
Looking good, looking good.
Come on, you can do it!

619
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,870
Here we go. He's gonna do it!

620
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,667
Wind up!

621
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:25,712
All right, well...

622
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:29,047
Spectacularly unsuccessful!
Why was my wrist so limp?

623
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,883
I was in the bathroom.

624
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,088
On my command.

625
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,559
-Come on, you can hit it.
-Two more. Come on.

626
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,255
Come on. Come on.

627
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,334
Fire!

628
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,595
Incoming!

629
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,808
Engineer, report!

630
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:59,042
All sensors are down and the sun shields
deployed upon impact.

631
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,050
Sir, we're blacked out.

632
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:10,827
The sun is exploding in my face!

633
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,727
I still haven't got a pulse.
Give me the paddles, stat.

634
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,028
-Oh, God. Don't watch.
-Clear!

635
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,803
Come on. Give me more juice.

636
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,099
Clear!

637
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,671
Power has been restored.

638
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:31,236
Oh, thank God!
Oh, God, is he gonna be okay?

639
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,614
We'll do an MRI just to be safe.

640
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,515
He's okay. He's okay.

641
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,786
How we doing? I have to warm it up first,

642
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,520
but just to double-check,
they took your keys, watch, coins?

643
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,494
-Yes.
-Good.

644
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:50,659
'Cause people always forget
the "M" in MRI stands for "magnetic."

645
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:55,261
This'll just take a second.

646
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,971
I guess I still have a few pennies.

647
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,551
I'm so sorry to have ruined your birthday.

648
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,148
Thanks for letting the cat out of the bag.

649
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,214
-Cat? Where's the cat?
-You know, it's okay,

650
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,489
because I'm not really
one for celebrating anyway.

651
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,326
Well, perhaps you will reconsider
and let us take you out for dinner.

652
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,865
Yeah.

653
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,359
Sir, with all due respect,
have you lost your mind?

654
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:32,204
They've helped us.
The least we can do is try to help them.

655
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,944
You have become a fool!

656
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:39,607
Treating these lumbering giants
as if they're our equals.

657
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,618
You've made a mockery
of our entire mission!

658
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:46,084
You get out of my face. Now!

659
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,526
<i>Dave?</i>

660
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,260
<i>Dave? Hello?</i>

661
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,928
-Right here.
-<i>Hey, where'd you go?</i>

662
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,630
I am here.

663
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:05,607
I'm so curious sometimes,
what's going on in that head of yours.

664
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,973
I was just pondering which would be
the best place to take you

665
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,410
to commemorate your birthday.

666
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,916
Josh, do you have any suggestions?
Perhaps a nice Cuban place?

667
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,043
I know a great salsa restaurant.

668
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,990
All right, well, <i>s, amigos,</i> let's go party.

669
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,919
Everyone! We're going to go and party!

670
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,746
Okay, three mojitos, one virgin.

671
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,148
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

672
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,119
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

673
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,348
-Thank you.
-There you go. You enjoy.

674
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,721
-Cheers.
-Happy birthday, Mom.

675
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,419
Thank you.

676
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:01,253
Now, careful.
These go straight to your head.

677
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,487
This is not acceptable!

678
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,086
Slow down, cowboy.

679
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,559
This is the best!

680
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:38,192
Cougar46 just added me as a friend.

681
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,758
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

682
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:44,535
He walked out about an hour ago
with a nice-looking lady and a kid.

683
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:48,771
-Oh, really? Nice-looking? She pretty hot?
-Please! Please.

684
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,143
-You sure it's him?
-Absolutely.

685
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,478
Said they were going
to a Cuban salsa place.

686
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,259
You gotta try this.

687
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:13,268
It's like space travel, only in your head.

688
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:26,341
I've been having strange feelings
since we've arrived on this planet.

689
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,914
-It seems you are, too?
-Absolutely not.

690
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:35,048
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm recalibrating our weapon systems.

691
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,319
Just a second.

692
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:45,531
Exactly what weapon
are you recalibrating?

693
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,666
Okay, let's talk.

694
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,669
I'm feeling a little busted.

695
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,977
You know, pretty soon
you're gonna be too old

696
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,275
to dance with your mom.

697
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:02,079
Excuse me while I run to the restroom.

698
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,186
Josh.

699
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,279
I will be going home soon.

700
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,527
What is the matter with you?

701
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:17,999
When you're gone, everything's just
gonna go back to the way it was.

702
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,126
I'm not like other kids.

703
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,467
I can't even fight for myself.

704
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,267
My dad was a hero.

705
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,036
But me?

706
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,341
I'm just different.

707
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:36,109
Josh, listen to me.

708
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:40,350
We would never have been able
to find the orb without you.

709
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,654
Not everyone would have helped us,
but you did.

710
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,160
Because you are different.

711
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,997
I am very lucky to have a friend like you.

712
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,764
-You're just saying that.
-No, I am not.

713
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:57,637
You have helped us greatly.
We are all in great debt to you.

714
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,108
I did?

715
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,502
Yes. We are saved, Josh.

716
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:19,387
She thinks she's so hot. She's not hot.
Have you seen her butt?

717
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:23,956
-It's like the size of our moon.
-You are so bad.

718
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,934
Bad and gorgeous!

719
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,034
Okay, another one. I took the liberty.

720
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,709
I love this song.

721
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,286
Need anything, Captain?

722
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,518
Yes, I may need
some music references for...

723
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,262
<i>Dave, will you do me the honor?</i>

724
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,764
<i>Come on!</i>

725
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,500
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

726
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,898
Yes, yes, I would,
I'd love to dance with you.

727
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,962
<i>You're gonna love it!</i>

728
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:10,177
Here, it's really easy.
Just let the music take you.

729
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,238
All hands, stay alert,
and obey my commands to the letter.

730
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:16,114
-Captain, might I have a word?
-Make it brief.

731
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,313
There are emotional dangers
on this planet we did not foresee.

732
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,550
We are on the brink of anarchy.

733
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,649
Not now.
I'm trying to let the music take me!

734
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,024
All right, crew, everyone,
let's get it together, now!

735
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,628
All together!

736
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,426
Precision!

737
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:32,332
Right foot! Left foot!

738
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,041
Okay. Here, just follow my lead.

739
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,178
We should be fulfilling our mission,
trying to save our planet,

740
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:53,280
not leaping around like some sort of idiot,
attempting to woo a gigantic strumpet!

741
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:56,325
This captain has become a joke.

742
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,955
This is over the line, sir.
The Captain still deserves our respect.

743
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,965
<i>Shake my hips like this! More hips! Hips!</i>

744
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,434
<i>Yes, that's it! More hips!</i>
<i>Look, I'm dancing!</i>

745
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,232
All right, I'm in.

746
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,266
The dancing stops now.

747
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,512
Here, here. Hand here. Okay?

748
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,482
I need more wiggle in the posterior region!

749
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,479
Captain, if I may?

750
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,044
You think that you can do better?

751
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,319
Nothing personal, sir,
but that won't be hard.

752
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:30,959
Take charge.

753
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,124
Okay, boys and girls, everybody listen up!

754
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,187
You're gonna give me a basic,

755
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,529
stepping forward with the left
and back with the right.

756
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,592
Don't bounce, and do not over think it.

757
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,948
We're gonna put your accoutrements
right up against her.

758
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,414
Drop down.

759
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,323
This is salsa, people. Let's make it spicy!

760
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:05,792
Follow me!

761
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:25,244
I knew you were holding out on me.

762
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,806
Come on, come on, girl.

763
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:31,217
I'm about to show you
how to do the forbidden dance.

764
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,014
It's my birthday!

765
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,023
And dip her, like a cookie in milk.

766
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,958
I feel good. I feel loose.

767
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,464
I feel good. I feel loose. I feel good.

768
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,592
Hey!

769
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,708
Freeze!

770
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:02,808
-Everybody, stay calm.
-Hands up. Hands up!

771
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,350
Should we power up blasters?

772
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,083
No.

773
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,893
Too many innocent civilians.

774
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:13,192
Easy, folks, easy.

775
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,231
-Step back, please.
-Dave?

776
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,460
Hey, welcome to Earth.

777
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,053
Greetings.

778
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,054
We don't want to hurt you.

779
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,757
We don't want to hurt you.

780
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,829
We're you're friends.

781
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:58,635
All we want to know
is why you've come down to our planet.

782
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,175
Oh, for God sake.

783
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,941
Stay calm. They can't prove anything.

784
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,180
<i>What is your purpose here?</i>

785
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,749
What is your purpose here?

786
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,809
-The mystery is what your purpose here is.
-Okay, you know what?

787
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,321
I'm trying to do a thing, and you're not
helping me out, so please stop.

788
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,092
Greetings!

789
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,719
No. 2, what are you doing?

790
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,492
-You can't do this, Two.
-Excuse me?

791
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:26,092
We're playing
by my rules now, Ex-Captain!

792
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,636
Seize him !

793
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:35,674
-You cannot do this, No. 2!
-Can, and will.

794
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:39,340
-You brought this on yourself.
-What are we supposed to do?

795
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,213
You do what you took an oath to do
and protect me, your captain, Four.

796
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,651
Stay back, Four.
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

797
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,883
You'll never get away with this, Two.
The rest of the crew will not support you!

798
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:51,222
Oh, yes, they will.
Because they have a mission to complete.

799
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,724
Three, you're supporting this?

800
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:55,457
Yes, I see no other way.

801
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:58,796
That's because there is no other way.

802
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:01,028
Whoa, who left the speaker on?

803
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,570
Shut that off!

804
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,278
Officer Dooley, can I speak to you outside?
Just for a minute.

805
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:18,382
You will regret this.
Something has been awakened in all of us.

806
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,479
Something you will never be able to stop.

807
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:24,583
Looks like I just did.
Confine him to his quarters!

808
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:29,531
Attention, crew! As of this moment,

809
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,558
un-Nilian behavior
will no longer be permitted.

810
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,433
In fact, it will be punished.

811
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:36,937
Severely.

812
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:40,134
A new era has begun,
with me as your leader.

813
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,575
You know,
we just met him a couple days ago,

814
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,476
-like I've said five times.
-Hey.

815
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,014
-Hey!
-You guys all right?

816
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,778
Yes. It's been a long night.

817
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,045
-What do they want with him?
-I don't know.

818
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:52,383
He didn't do anything wrong!

819
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,583
Stand and engage blasters!

820
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:58,990
Sir?

821
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,825
I gave you an order.

822
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,560
Yes, sir.

823
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,827
-Did you not just hear those voices?
-Yes, I heard the voices.

824
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,566
Wow, we got a nutjob living
in New York City. What are the odds?

825
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,198
So what are you saying?
We should just let him go?

826
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,470
Yes, I think we should let him go!
That's exactly what I'm saying!

827
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:18,502
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard in my entire life!

828
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:20,274
Hey!

829
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,486
Activate heat shields.

830
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,457
-Freeze!
-Look out!

831
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:37,225
This guy's crazy!
Somebody about to get killed!

832
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,928
I'm out! Son of a...

833
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:46,940
Take cover!

834
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,614
You, woman and child,

835
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:03,352
you have wasted enough time
with your pathetic emotional distractions.

836
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:04,859
Dave?

837
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,954
<i>Your undisciplined human frailty</i>
<i>causes nothing but chaos!</i>

838
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:11,329
And one other thing,
your so-called artwork

839
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,891
is both pretentious and sophomoric.

840
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,967
I could do this all day.

841
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:33,916
Freeze!

842
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:48,059
Three, find me the fastest route
to the landing site.

843
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,627
Three, I...

844
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,408
Guards!

845
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:58,807
No. 12! Have you been working out?

846
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,578
You can tell?

847
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,844
No.

848
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,614
Yes.

849
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,988
-Thank you, Three.
-I didn't do this to help you.

850
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,959
I did this to stop that lunatic!

851
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:17,295
-What have I done to hurt you so?
-You really can't be that oblivious!

852
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,766
Listen to me. Whatever I have
done to hurt you, I apologize,

853
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,268
but right now we have to
get to the engine room

854
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,636
-and shut down the ship!
-Fine! Let's just go.

855
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,908
What in Nil is your problem?

856
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,603
Are you all right, Josh?

857
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:32,238
Mom, I'm fine, but something's wrong.
That can't be Dave!

858
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:35,647
You have to trust me.
We need to go after him.

859
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,310
No, Josh, we're not doing that.

860
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,479
-I know you want to protect me.
-Of course.

861
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:43,719
But Dave is my friend,
and I need to protect him right now.

862
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,784
-Josh.
-If we don't help him,

863
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:49,319
something terrible's gonna happen.
I know it!

864
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:52,763
I was just making conversation to ease
the apparent tension between us.

865
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,066
-Don't. You're making it worse.
-You know what...

866
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,945
No. 3, didn't take you long to betray me.

867
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,746
This is not the answer, Two!

868
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:13,687
You weren't Nilian enough
to do your duty,

869
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,748
-so you left me no choice.
-Listen to reason.

870
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:19,351
We thought that Earth was not
worth preserving. We were wrong.

871
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,952
There's much we've learned
from this place.

872
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:25,262
-We must not hurt these people!
-Yes, we must!

873
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:32,432
And since you two seem to love
these gargantuan beasts so much,

874
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,669
have fun living among them.

875
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,671
I have a little tickle in my nose.

876
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,831
-Follow me!
-No, follow me!

877
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,371
Three, I'm so sorry
that you're out here with me.

878
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,140
Not half as sorry as I am !

879
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:14,774
Please, we'll have the entire
journey back home to argue.

880
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:19,215
-This may not be the best spot, sir.
-And why not?

881
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,019
Mother of Nil!

882
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,234
Three!

883
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,438
-I'm coming, Three. Don't move.
-Great advice, Captain.

884
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,414
Because I can't!

885
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,784
-Are you all right, Three?
-Please! You have no concern for me.

886
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,157
All you care about is Gina,
your big, fat girlfriend!

887
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,217
You think that she's fat?

888
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,059
If she wears a size infinity,

889
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,697
then she's fat!

890
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:12,440
It takes me almost getting run over
for you to even notice me!

891
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,976
I'm practically invisible to you!

892
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,513
Invisible? Quite the opposite.
When I look at you, what I see is

893
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:20,879
the ship!

894
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,048
I love New York. Let's go!

895
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,963
Trust me, Three. Jump!

896
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,995
It's working!

897
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,343
You see? Just as I planned!

898
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,991
Look, if we let go
at precisely the right moment,

899
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,555
we'll be propelled to the ship.

900
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,731
On three.

901
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:20,169
One, two, three!

902
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:27,777
Three.

903
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:32,814
I asked for you
to be assigned to this mission

904
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:37,348
because you are kind,
intelligent and beautiful,

905
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,554
more so than anyone
I've ever known in my life.

906
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,893
And without you,

907
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,329
I would be nothing.

908
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,598
Why have you never
spoken to me of this before?

909
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:55,071
Because I was too Nilian to express it.

910
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:59,570
I should have lassoed the moon
for you long ago.

911
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,490
But now let's turn the ship around.

912
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:28,937
We'll never get there at this rate.
Give me full power to the legs!

913
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:33,175
<i>I told you. Our power is nearly depleted.</i>

914
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:39,880
Crew, prepare to hail a cab!

915
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:43,482
Taxi!

916
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,391
What? An alien cannot
get a cab in this town?

917
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:01,774
Hey, buddy! This is my cab!
What are you doing?

918
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:06,440
Liberty Island Ferry. Make haste or die.

919
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:12,351
Yes, every available cop in the city,
and the Feds.

920
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:16,824
I knew it. I knew it, I knew it!
I knew we were not alone in this universe.

921
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,487
-Look, I'm not convinced he's an alien.
-Oh, you're not?

922
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,258
-So what?
-So what? So, who you calling?

923
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:26,995
-Homeland Security.
-Don't do that.

924
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,299
They're gonna overreact!
We don't even know why he's visiting yet.

925
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:32,033
Well, it's obviously not a peace mission!

926
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,598
Get those big slobbery lips away from me!

927
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,667
And while you suckers
are sitting here talking,

928
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,679
he about to go suck your planet dry!

929
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,079
I need somebody
from Homeland Security, please.

930
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,015
I don't have the extension.

931
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,518
-Are you with Dave?
-No.

932
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,282
No, no. I come free with a venti latte.

933
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,983
Of course I'm with Dave, stupid!

934
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:52,026
-I need... Hey, you got a comment?
-No.

935
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,758
I need the extension from you guys
because I don't have it.

936
01:13:57,466 --> 01:14:00,299
-Do you know where he went?
-Yes, I do.

937
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:02,269
I need a ride, though.

938
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,573
-Okay.
-Well, what you waiting for?

939
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,134
Okay.

940
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,938
Wait, wait, wait.

941
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,940
Don't be shaking me.

942
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,846
Sorry. I apologize.

943
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,646
Don't be blowing on me!
I don't know you that well!

944
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:20,517
Slow down. Slow. Wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, I said slow down now!

945
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,056
Wait, it's dark in here. I'm in.

946
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,582
Please, hurry. Dooley, where you going?

947
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,390
Hey, Sarge, you got
a little schmutz right here.

948
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,760
Shut up!

949
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:36,127
-How many tickets you got?
-I've never been caught speeding.

950
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,900
In New York.

951
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,372
This year.

952
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,439
Long live Nil.

953
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:52,180
Sorry, Earth. Sometimes No. 2 happens!

954
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:55,887
Captain! Thank goodness you're back.

955
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,550
No. 2's become a raging lunatic.

956
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:01,187
Not to worry, kind friend.
I'm back, and I'm taking over.

957
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,800
<i>Welcome, Captain.</i>

958
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:20,840
<i>Right Arm!</i>

959
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:24,477
-What the devil is this?
-<i>Someone's overriding the system!</i>

960
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,420
Only the Captain has the code to...

961
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:30,224
The Captain!

962
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,448
You are in my chair!

963
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,484
Guards!

964
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,685
-Put down your weapons.
-Seize him !

965
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,390
Guards, I said seize him !
You've seen what a fool he's been!

966
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:15,266
We all know I am the only one
qualified to get us home.

967
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,565
Is this what you want? This chaos?

968
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,281
We choose our Captain.

969
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:30,582
This planet rocks. Deal with it.

970
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,388
Get out of my chair.

971
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:44,354
Captain, the orb is in the water.

972
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:48,028
The siphoning process
is getting stronger by the minute.

973
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,306
Right Arm, summon the orb.

974
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:59,507
Captain, the fight
drained our power below 1%.

975
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:04,382
I can re-route booster energy,
but there won't be enough for take-off.

976
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:10,183
Well, Captain, it seems you have a choice.

977
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:14,258
Save this planet or save yourself.

978
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,629
I choose this planet.

979
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:21,294
And what of your beloved crew?

980
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:24,669
Are you willing
to condemn them to the same fate?

981
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,232
Stranded here in a world of behemoths?

982
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:32,513
I believe it is the right thing to do,

983
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,744
but I cannot
make this decision for all of you.

984
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,749
I say we save Earth.

985
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,311
And its moon.

986
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:46,256
My life began on this planet.

987
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,489
I no longer feel like No. 3.

988
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:54,702
I am Dave Ming Chang.

989
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,365
<i>I have 443 new friends on MySpace</i>

990
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:02,809
and a JDate next week
with a woman named Sheila Moskowitz.

991
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:06,939
I am Dave Ming Chang.

992
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,707
I am Dave Ming Chang.

993
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:13,846
-I am Dave Ming Chang.
-I am Dave Ming Chang.

994
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:17,619
-I am Dave Ming Chang.
-I am Dave Ming Chang.

995
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:21,925
I am Johnny Dazzles, and I am fabulous!

996
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:27,033
What? Not everybody
has to be Dave Ming Chang.

997
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,595
You've all gone completely mad!

998
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,267
Take him and put him

999
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,969
in my butt.

1000
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:45,745
Engineer, divert all remaining power
to Right Arm.

1001
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:38,529
-Way to go, Right Arm !
-<i>Yes!</i>

1002
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:47,772
Dave! Are you okay?

1003
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:51,979
Dave! What is happening?
How can we help you?

1004
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:54,886
Thank you, but it is too late.

1005
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,856
We are out of power.

1006
01:19:56,925 --> 01:20:00,656
We'll never get back now. It is over.

1007
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:04,563
Hands behind your head! Understand?
Step away from that thing!

1008
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,931
-No!
-Hey! Let us handle this, folks, okay?

1009
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:08,993
You don't need your guns, all right?
Don't hurt him !

1010
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,594
We're not gonna hurt anybody.

1011
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:12,663
-We're just gonna talk.
-Dooley, enough!

1012
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:15,505
You've seen what that thing can do.
Hands behind your head!

1013
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,341
<i>Captain, with no shield and no power,</i>

1014
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:21,712
<i>the projectile from his weapon</i>
<i>will breach the hull.</i>

1015
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,444
We'll take casualties.

1016
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,110
He can't move!
He doesn't have any power left!

1017
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:27,621
-Hands behind your head!
-He can't move!

1018
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:28,781
-Josh!
-Kid!

1019
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,256
Josh!

1020
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,168
We have power. We have been saved.

1021
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:43,966
All hail Josh the hero!

1022
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,671
Stay right where you are!

1023
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:59,251
Yeah, if you're trying to freak me out,
it's not gonna work.

1024
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,849
All right, that's gonna freak me out a little.
Do you see that?

1025
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:07,224
-I do.
-Is that a guy?

1026
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:08,819
-Looks like it.
-Like a really little guy?

1027
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,762
-Like a really little guy.
-On his tongue?

1028
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,925
What'd I just say?

1029
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,333
-Hello.
-You, you see that, right?

1030
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:18,201
-There's a little guy in there?
-He's talking.

1031
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,741
-Yeah.
-Dave.

1032
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:24,438
I apologize to all of you.

1033
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:28,141
It was my second-in-command
who took control of my ship by force,

1034
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:31,083
and it was he, not I, who performed
these unspeakable acts of cruelty.

1035
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:32,779
Will you put that thing down?
Would you please?

1036
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:37,086
I mean, the guy's an inch tall.
You look like a wuss. Right?

1037
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:41,219
Josh, my friend.
You helped save two worlds today.

1038
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:46,065
And you taught me the true meaning
of friendship and courage.

1039
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,769
Your father would have been proud
of his young captain.

1040
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:52,932
Promise me you'll always take pride
in being different.

1041
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,805
-I promise.
-High-five.

1042
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:00,674
Perhaps that's not such a great idea.

1043
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,146
-Gina.
-Yeah. Yeah, hi.

1044
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,487
You're, you're really tiny.

1045
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,025
And I should have known
you were an alien,

1046
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,084
because no straight man
is that good a dancer.

1047
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:18,997
I think I'm finally able to understand
how your painting makes me feel.

1048
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,137
I feel love.

1049
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:31,273
-Okay, I guess she's not that fat.
-Told you.

1050
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:36,682
Hey! Hey, man!
Hey, don't forget about me!

1051
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,080
Yeah! I'm not trying to stay in here!

1052
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:42,822
You squeezing my brain!

1053
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:46,224
-You're gonna make it pop! Stop!
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1054
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,387
Hey, slow down.
I don't want you messing up my sexy.

1055
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,864
Okay. Easy.
Almost, almost, almost, almost.

1056
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:53,591
Okay.

1057
01:22:57,772 --> 01:23:01,731
Hey! Yeah. Yeah, that, that look good.

1058
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:06,370
Time for us to go home.

1059
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,512
-I'll miss you, Dave.
-And I you.

1060
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,811
Remember, I'll never be that far away,

1061
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:18,091
good friend.

1062
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,737
A little room, please.

1063
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:52,357
What? No!

1064
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,497
Dave!

1065
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:09,906
-FBI!
-Out of the way!

1066
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:11,536
Move, move, move!

1067
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:13,843
-No!
-Hey, what is going on?

1068
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,554
Mom, look!

1069
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:37,761
He's okay.

1070
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,219
I didn't think we'd make it out of there.

1071
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:59,158
Good thing you have
such big feet, Captain.

1072
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,752
We'll have much to explain
when we return home.

1073
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,391
We'll find another way to save Nil.

1074
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,492
There are plenty of worlds out there
for us to explore.

1075
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,230
Yes, No. 3.

1076
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:10,566
But what we learned on Earth

1077
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:13,630
is more valuable
than all the salt in the galaxy.

1078
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:18,077
And when we do return,
it looks like I'll be needing a new No. 2.

1079
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:21,013
I think you'll be needing more than that.

1080
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,714
Yeah, Captain! Get in there, Captain!

1081
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:50,601
Cue the new anthem.
