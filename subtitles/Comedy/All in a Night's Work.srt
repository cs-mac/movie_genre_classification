1
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,678
Oh, well, none of us can live forever.

2
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,512
Remarkable man, the colonel.

3
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,878
A girl's earring.

4
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,355
Remarkable.

5
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,508
What a lovely sunrise.

6
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,750
Too bad he just missed it.

7
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,672
Hello.

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,916
Yes, this is Mr. Tony Ryder.

9
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,352
He did?

10
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,710
When?

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,712
I see.

12
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,396
I see, yeah.
Thanks forcalling.

13
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,399
- Bad news, sweetie?
- Yeah. My uncle, honey.

14
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,870
Look, you... You better leave,
sweetheart.

15
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,877
- Get going.
- But don't...

16
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,435
- But, Tony...
- That's all right.

17
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,278
- You call me later.
- But, Tony...

18
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,198
Goodbye.

19
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,470
But, Tony, I live here.

20
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,515
- Take a look, Mr. O'Hara.
- I'm looking.

21
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,508
The Ryder Building.
Fifty stories of glass and steel.

22
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,870
With a statue ofthe colonel
on the top.

23
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,593
In solid bronze.

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,358
Holding one ofhis magazines.

25
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,118
Your magazines now.

26
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,993
- He left everything to you, me boy.
- Even you.

27
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,829
I'll do me very best to serve you with
the same devotion I did the colonel.

28
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,191
Tell me something.
How do you follow a man like that?

29
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,675
It won't be easy, lad.

30
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,552
You know, I've got to prove to them

31
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,955
that I'm as good a man forthis job
as my uncle was.

32
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,639
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be easy.

33
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,159
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

34
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,156
Well, you know, in five minutes

35
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,432
I'm going to head up
my first board meeting.

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,189
- You think I'll get away with it?
- Sure you will, Mr. Ryder.

37
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,675
That's one ofthe advantages
ofbeing at the top.

38
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,509
Anybody who tells you you're making
a mistake is making a bigger mistake.

39
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,473
Sure, and I feel betternow.

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,952
I still can't believe he's not going
to walk through that door

41
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,674
and tell us what's wrong
with the latest issues.

42
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,156
He'stelling it to that big publisher
up there.

43
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,430
What about young Ryder? Do you
think he'sthe right man to take over?

44
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,995
We don't have much choice.

45
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,311
He'sthe only relative.

46
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,708
Gentlemen.

47
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,399
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

48
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,914
Greetings, my boy.

49
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,269
Welcome, welcome.

50
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,755
Mr. Albright, Mr. Baker,
Mr. Carter, Mr. Weaver.

51
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,359
How do you do?

52
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,552
Oh, no, no, no. Excuse me.
The chairman ofthe board sits here.

53
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,593
The colonel's chairfor you, my boy.

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,477
Thank you.

55
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,312
Well, now, then, I'd like to make
my position absolutely clear.

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,949
My late uncle and I, we hardly...

57
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,438
Oh, sorry.

58
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,552
Hardly knew each other.
In fact, we were practically strangers.

59
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,478
Some of you may think
the only reason

60
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,877
I'm the new chairman ofthe board
is because I'm his only relative.

61
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,275
Oh, not at all, not at all.

62
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,678
Nevertheless, it's true. Anyway, I'll
do the best I can, and that's about it.

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,594
You'll do fine, Tony. Believe me,
your past reputation is behind you.

64
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,957
From a useless life to a life of use,
that'sthe way I look at it.

65
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,668
Nothing like responsibility
to give a man backbone.

66
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,751
- And initiative.
- And drive.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,117
You may not be much,
but you're all we've got.

68
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,471
Thank you, gentlemen,
for your vote of confidence.

69
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,198
Now, what's our problem fortoday?

70
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,789
The colonel.
He picked a critical time to die.

71
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,996
What about our overseas
expansion program?

72
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,556
We've been trying to float a bank loan
for $5 million. Now what?

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,758
We'll open our European branches
next month, right on schedule.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,194
What do we use for money?

75
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,749
Oh, I took care ofthe bank loan
overthe weekend.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,072
I called on an old skin-diving buddy
of mine, Pudge Hamilton.

77
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,998
Hamilton? OfHamilton Trust?

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,876
His son. Anyway, the bank is willing
to back us on the colonel's reputation.

79
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,548
That's wonderful news, Tony.

80
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,429
Of course, they'll have to ratify it
at theirfinance meeting Wednesday.

81
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,670
In the meantime, I jotted down some
figures on the expansion program.

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,955
Afew more here.

83
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,351
Didn't win a bet that day.

84
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,279
Oh, shot a 76.
That was all right.

85
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,359
Mr. Ryder.

86
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,475
Amortization. Profit potential.
See what you think ofit, fellas.

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,797
He's a very commonplace man.

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,797
He said it was important.

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,833
But I don't know
any house detectives.

90
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,312
Did he happen to mention
any particular city?

91
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,193
- Like London? Paris? Omaha?
- No, sir.

92
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,550
Just that there was
a young lady involved.

93
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,911
Oh, well, it's probably just a case
of mistaken identity.

94
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,192
I'd better see him,
straighten this out.

95
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,229
I didn't know he could even spell
"amortization. "

96
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,757
Mr. Ryderwill see you now,
Mr. Lasker.

97
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,351
Gloria?

98
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,392
Jeanie?

99
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,477
Jackie?

100
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,590
Mr. Ryder, I think there's
something you ought to know.

101
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,109
Now I remember. Quebec.

102
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,918
Chateau Sans Souci.

103
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,918
Yeah, I can explain about that girl
in my room that night.

104
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,232
She said she was a ski instructor.
I didn't find out till later...

105
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,271
It wasn't Quebec.

106
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,278
Palm Beach. Mirador Hotel.

107
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,755
Mira...? Mirador?

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,719
Well, that's where my uncle
always stays.

109
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,876
- Or stayed.
- Oh, yes, sir.

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,554
With him being youruncle,
his reputation and all,

111
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,038
I figured you didn't want
this kind ofthing to get out.

112
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,435
Has she contacted you yet?

113
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,870
Who contacted me?

114
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,079
Your uncle's girlfriend.

115
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,272
His girl...?
Look, you'd betterfill me in.

116
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,675
I don't know what you're...
Sit down, won't you.

117
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,996
Sure. Sure.

118
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,875
You see, I was on duty
early Saturday morning.

119
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,356
I got this complaint that there was
a disturbance on the ninth floor.

120
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,597
I went up to investigate. When
I got halfway down the corridor,

121
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,475
I spotted this girl running out
of your uncle's bedroom.

122
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,913
Oh, well, I could think of a million
innocent explanations forthat.

123
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,759
She could have been a manicurist.

124
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,958
- At 3 a. M?
- Three a. m.

125
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,639
Wearing a Turkish towel?

126
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,751
A masseuse.
You know, Turkish towel? No?

127
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,793
- What did you do? Did you catch her?
- I tried.

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,797
But she beat me to the elevator
and got away.

129
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,073
When I got back, your uncle's room,
the place was all a shambles.

130
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,955
The furniture was knocked down,
the lamp was broken.

131
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,314
He was in bed.

132
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,391
Dead.

133
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,639
He was smiling.

134
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,071
Smiling?

135
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,157
Have you told anybody else
about this?

136
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,749
No, no, sir. No, no.
Only the manager.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,709
He thought it would be betterfor
everybody if we just kept this quiet.

138
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,349
- Did you ever see this girl before?
- No, sir.

139
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,873
- Did you get a good look at her?
- Yeah!

140
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,640
That is, I'd recognize her
ifl saw her again.

141
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,078
Say, maybe this'll help.

142
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,316
It's an earring I found
on the floor nearthe bed.

143
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,153
I checked.

144
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,839
That inscription means
"good" in Chinese.

145
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,998
Chinese.

146
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,156
Look, I'll keep this.

147
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,033
Do you think you could stay around
fora few days?

148
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,117
The boss said to do
anything you asked.

149
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,117
Youruncle was
a very good customer.

150
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,471
Good. Well, my secretary'll
get you a hotel room.

151
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,591
I have a hunch this girl's
gonna show up,

152
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,233
and I want you to identify her.

153
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,668
Oh, it'd be a pleasure.

154
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,235
In the meantime,
consider yourself on the payroll.

155
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,839
We'll just charge it offto...

156
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,315
- Research?
- Research.

157
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,112
These are very interesting figures,
Tony. We'd like to talk to you...

158
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,118
He was a remarkable man.

159
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,675
He was a more remarkable man
than you think.

160
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,480
Sam, you were
the colonel's oldest friend.

161
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,874
Thirty years' worth.

162
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,595
Did he have any love affairs, I mean,
after my aunt died? Did he ever...?

163
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,110
Never. The colonel had
only one love, his work.

164
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,993
He built his whole empire
on fidelity and chastity.

165
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,873
Well, now, Sam, there was
that lady dentist in Seattle.

166
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,709
Purely platonic.
Anyway, we paid her off years ago.

167
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,911
Well, what about
that female archeologist?

168
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,758
That tall woman with the pith helmet?

169
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,076
Threatened to expose him
to the National Geographic?

170
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,232
You notice she stopped that kind
ofirresponsible talk in a hurry.

171
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,510
Yeah.
The minute we paid her off.

172
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,790
Boys, I've got a flash for you.

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,073
The colonel died with
an undressed girl in his bedroom.

174
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,032
I'm not certain about her occupation,

175
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,676
but I have a hunch that payoffnumber
three is right around the corner.

176
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,156
And the house dick at the Mirador
said he saw a girl running

177
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,518
from Uncle Charlie's bedroom
wearing this.

178
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,792
- Just an earring?
- And a Turkish towel.

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,433
This means "good" in Chinese.

180
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,955
And 10-to-1 that the mate
to this says "luck. "

181
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,549
It ought to. That young woman
has us over a barrel.

182
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,631
Blackmail.
I can see the headlines:

183
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,034
"Founder ofFamily Magazine Dies
in Love Nest with a Naked Nymph. "

184
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,117
And a smile on his face.

185
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,469
The bank loan!

186
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,069
Lfthey hear about this,
we won't be able to borrow a quarter!

187
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,999
- What are we going to do?
- Buy her offlike the others.

188
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,519
Where do we find her?

189
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,190
I have a funny feeling she'll find us.
I can draw you a picture ofher.

190
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,837
She's young, beautiful, sentimental,
especially about money.

191
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,393
I can even spot her entrance.

192
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,358
- Where?
- At the funeral.

193
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,039
Where's a better place
to show the world

194
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,673
how much she's gonna miss
the colonel?

195
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,399
So we will know Thursday.

196
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,113
No, that'll be too late.

197
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,958
The bank committee meets
Wednesday.

198
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,594
- We'll have the funeral Tuesday.
- That'stomorrow.

199
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,949
What about all the preparations?

200
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,832
We were going to give him
a military ceremony.

201
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,634
Some four-star generals were
coming up from Washington.

202
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,671
We wanted him to go out in style.

203
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,192
Sam, he went out in style.

204
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,272
Katie! Hi!

205
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,235
Hello, Marge.

206
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,874
Welcome back
to the decompression chamber.

207
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,231
- Well, how was Palm Beach?
- It was all right, I guess.

208
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,910
All right? Is that all you've gotta say?
What'd you do there?

209
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,680
I got a tan and lost an earring.

210
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,998
Palm Beach, moonlight, millionaires,
and all you lost was an earring?

211
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,033
Didn't you get to meet any
ofthose millionaires?

212
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,755
- What made you ask that?
- Just my feminine sense of greed.

213
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,112
- Well, did you?
- Yes. I met a millionaire.

214
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,788
What's that? Who sitsthere?

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,195
The new researcher. Aman.

216
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,630
Imagine.
I haven't met him yet.

217
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,908
Research, Robbins.

218
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,076
Hi. Guess who this is.

219
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,757
Well, I'll give you a hint.
I'm tall, witty, good-looking...

220
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,394
...and you're simply mad about me.
- Warren.

221
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,352
Oh, how sweet of you to call.

222
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,472
What'sthe matterwith yourvoice?
You ought to see a doctor.

223
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,750
But, honey, I am a doctor.
It's nothing serious.

224
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,349
Just something I picked up
from one of my patients.

225
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,551
- How was Florida?
- Oh, it was all right.

226
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,672
- But I'm glad I'm back.
- So am I.

227
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,632
And so will Mom and Dad be.

228
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,549
- Oh, yourfolks are in town?
- Just got in this morning.

229
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,274
They can't wait to meet you.

230
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,112
- Well, I hope they like me.
- They'll love you.

231
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,711
Oh, well, that makes me feel better.

232
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,471
How about the four of us getting
together, say, Wednesday night?

233
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,630
Oh, that's fine. Fine.
I'd love to.

234
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,956
- I'll see you then.
- Goodbye, dear.

235
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,519
Bye.

236
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,949
Now, then, old man, let's just
make sure this isn't psychosomatic.

237
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,071
Say, 'Woof, woof. "

238
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,829
You know, you're sure lucky to be
marrying a professional man

239
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,077
who owns his own business. I don't
know why you even went to Florida.

240
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,555
Oh, I went to think it over.

241
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,516
Warren's a wonderful man, Marge,

242
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,269
but I don't know ifl, well...

243
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,598
- Love him?
- No. Deserve him.

244
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,270
Every girl deserves a man,
whethershe deserves him or not.

245
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,154
Katie, come on, come on.
We're keeping them waiting.

246
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,749
- Who?
- The brass, the brass.

247
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,638
You're on the bargaining committee.

248
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,990
Oh, no, Harry.
I'm on Health and Welfare.

249
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,758
You've been kicked upstairs, kiddo.

250
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,916
Union-wise, you're in the big time.

251
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,032
But I've been working on pink paper
towels forthe ladies' lounge.

252
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,798
Chicken feed, chicken feed.

253
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,911
Now we're gonna hit them
with some real stiff demands.

254
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,276
We'll probably be knocking heads
right through lunch hour.

255
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,835
Oh, but, no, I have to do some
shopping during my lunch hour.

256
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,828
You see, I have to have a "good"
to go with my "luck. "

257
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,872
Now, don't be upset
if I do some table-pounding.

258
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,633
And wheneverthey make a demand,

259
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,876
you just shake your head
and look worried.

260
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,951
But I am worried.

261
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,991
The union committee is here.

262
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,879
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

263
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,875
Oh, this is Mr. Ryder.
Mr. Ryder, Mr. Lane, Mr. Kowalski.

264
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,990
How are you?

265
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,629
This is Katie Robbins,
the new member of our committee.

266
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,355
Joe Kowalski.
Katie, this is Mr. Ryder.

267
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,232
- How do you do?
- Hello.

268
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,238
Katie.

269
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,797
All right, now, let's get the ball rolling.

270
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,072
- Here'sthe union proposal.
- Absolutely ridiculous.

271
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,840
This is no proposal.
It is a knife at ourthroat!

272
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,629
Don't you think
we should read it first?

273
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,795
Strong medicine, eh, Mr. Ryder?

274
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,355
Seems pretty reasonable.

275
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,437
It seems reasonable on the surface.

276
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,949
- But can management live with it?
- No!

277
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,037
That's not an answer,
it's an ultimatum.

278
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,674
- Take it or leave it!
- It's a knife at ourthroat!

279
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,952
- I said that.
- Gentlemen, please.

280
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,912
What do you think, Miss?

281
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,918
Robbins. Katie Robbins.
I'm in Research.

282
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,999
Research? Oh, that's one of our more
vital departments in the organization.

283
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,918
- Where is it?
- Forty-fifth floor,

284
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,634
behind the water cooler.
"Cooler. "

285
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,912
You could hardly call it that,
the way it's been working lately.

286
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,112
I was just saying the other day in
Health and Welfare, we really should...

287
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,912
Is that with two B's?

288
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,513
What, cooler?

289
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,478
No, Robbins.

290
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,830
- Yes, two B's.
- B's, B's.

291
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,555
Miss Robbins, we've got
a very important agenda here.

292
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,318
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,034
Severance pay. Seniority rights.
Fringe benefits.

294
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,390
She said she was sorry.

295
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,717
When it comesto fringe benefits,
I'd say the union's getting

296
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,912
all the benefits and management's
left holding the fringe.

297
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,430
- Well put.
- All we want's a fair deal.

298
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,349
- Ashare ofthe profits.
- And a new water cooler.

299
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,870
Well, I mean, on a hot day,
really, our morale...

300
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,275
Will you forget the water cooler.

301
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,040
Look, if you don't wanna negotiate,
we're walking out.

302
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,629
- All right, walk.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

303
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,876
This bickering is getting us no place.

304
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,311
Now, I suggest we adjourn
to a subcommittee oftwo,

305
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,238
to feel each other out.

306
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,352
Mr. Dunning, why don't you
meet Harry afterlunch.

307
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,511
Oh, just a minute.
I have a better idea.

308
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,234
Now, a subcommittee oftwo is
an excellent suggestion,

309
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,275
but any feeling-out process should
logically take place between members

310
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,950
ofthis group who haven't displayed
antagonism towards one another.

311
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,594
In otherwords,
between Miss Robbins and myself.

312
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,998
Now, you don't feel antagonistic
towards me, do you, Miss Robbins?

313
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,315
Well, no.

314
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,799
Good. Nor I towards you. So it seems
logical that you and I should meet.

315
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,036
You and I meet?

316
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,390
- Oh, now, orafter lunch?
- During lunch.

317
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,677
No use wasting
valuable working hours.

318
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,673
Meeting adjourned.

319
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,430
Yeah, well, keep looking.

320
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,198
Gotcha.

321
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,070
I'll be back, but if I get
any out-of-town calls...

322
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,198
Oh, I...
I will be so glad to take them.

323
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,799
Don't take them.

324
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,356
Oh, don't take them. Gotcha.

325
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,991
Don't... Don't take them.

326
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,872
Gotcha.

327
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,155
Oh, pardon me.

328
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,755
What'sthis, Marge?

329
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,719
I don't know. It came
for you a few minutes ago.

330
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,554
It must be that bathing suit
I bought in Palm Beach.

331
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,832
They were having a sale
at this little place...

332
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,591
Marge, somebody made a mistake.

333
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,115
Oh, my dear, I wish I did.

334
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,878
This isn't my coat!

335
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,672
"Miss Katie Robbins. "

336
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,558
Well, it's another Katie Robbins!

337
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,478
"Ryder Building, New York,
New York. "

338
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,716
Well, it's another New York!

339
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,680
I guess it is my coat, isn't it.

340
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,512
Marge.

341
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,196
- Yes?
- Can you keep a secret?

342
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,393
Oh, Katie, I'd just love to.
Just give me the chance.

343
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,911
I wanted to be by myself
on my vacation,

344
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,435
you know, sort ofthink things over,
about Warren

345
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,073
and getting married and all.

346
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,153
Well, it's too important a step
to just rush into like that.

347
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,114
I know that, I know that, Katie,
but, now, what about the coat?

348
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,029
Health and Welfare found me
a nice motel nearthe beach.

349
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,353
It was 7 dollars a day,
including a continental breakfast.

350
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,872
Florida is a wonderful place,
if you're a grapefruit.

351
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,638
Or half of a twosome.

352
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,919
Not that I didn't get offers.

353
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,749
But I wasn't interested in
that kind oftraveler's aid.

354
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,830
So I tried to find things
I could do alone.

355
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,157
That eliminated just about everything
that's any fun.

356
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,874
During the day, I went to the beach.

357
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,798
I read a lot.

358
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,991
That is, I tried to.

359
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,796
But fiction sounded pretty dull

360
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,391
with all the juicy nonfiction
going on around me.

361
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,389
At night, though, Palm Beach
was lovely,

362
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,195
with that big tropical moon
and those dark, velvety clouds

363
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,119
filled with romance and mystery.

364
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,229
There I was, trespassing
in the garden

365
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,434
of an exclusive hotel,
pretending to be one ofthe elite.

366
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,358
With all the romance around me,
there I was with my partner,

367
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,835
a very romantic sort of fellow.

368
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,235
Full of air.

369
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,677
- Help! Help!
- Suddenly I heard someone

370
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,150
calling for help.
There was a man in the pool.

371
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,999
- He seemed to be drowning.
- Help!

372
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,350
And I was wearing my
flowered chiffon that cost me

373
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,118
two whole months without dessert.

374
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,511
My partnerwas useless, and I
remembered my Girl Scout training.

375
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,915
Aperson goes down
only three times.

376
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,878
- Help!
- And this one was on his fourth.

377
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,278
Help!

378
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,593
I realized at once that poor
Mr. Hackett had been drinking.

379
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,469
That was his name, Kirby Hackett,
ofHackett Industries.

380
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,911
I couldn't leave him there,
he was chilled to the bone.

381
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,237
So I decided to help him
up to his room.

382
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,593
That was my first mistake.

383
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,112
My second mistake
was playing Good Samaritan.

384
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,551
I bundled him up
so he wouldn't catch pneumonia.

385
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,436
And then I realized I was
the next likely candidate for it myself.

386
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,719
In my wet chiffon,
I felt like a clam at low tide.

387
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,636
As long as he was sound asleep,
I decided to get dried off.

388
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,829
That was my third mistake.

389
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,792
While I'd been playing
Good Samaritan,

390
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,831
Mr. Hackett had been
playing possum.

391
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,039
I said, "Mr. Hackett!
Please, I'm not dressed!"

392
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,836
And he said, "But, sweetie,
it's not as if we were strangers.

393
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,633
You saved my life!"

394
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,832
No, no, no, no, now, you stay right...
Mr. Hackett!

395
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,994
So I said, "Goodbye, Mr. Hackett. "

396
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,713
I didn't know where I was going,

397
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,999
but anything was an improvement
overwhat I'd just left.

398
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,158
I went through some curtains.

399
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,670
It was dark, but I could just tell
I was in another man's bedroom.

400
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,596
This just seemed to be my night
for it. There was a man in bed.

401
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,075
- And you know who it was?
- Frank Sinatra.

402
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,475
Oh, Marge. Colonel Ryder!

403
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,796
- Our Colonel Ryder?
- Yes.

404
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,399
Oh, you are sly.

405
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,033
That isn't even the half ofit.

406
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,589
Oh, I'm perfectly willing to listen
to the other half.

407
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,990
Then it wasthe colonel
who gave you the mink coat?

408
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,679
No, he couldn't.
Don't you see...?

409
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,836
Lfhe didn't, who did give
you the coat?

410
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,514
Mr. Hackett!
Bright and early the next morning,

411
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,631
I got a phone call.
It was Mr. Hackett.

412
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,400
Anyway, on the phone he said he
was sending me a mink coat

413
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,479
for saving his life. And he did,
and this is it. And I'm returning it.

414
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,433
- Why?
- Because I don't deserve it.

415
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,790
Listen, Katie, there's
no need to be so noble.

416
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,718
Even Dr. Schweitzer
takes donations.

417
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,070
Oh, Marge. Back it goes.

418
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,352
I refuse to be obligated to a man
who practically drowns himself

419
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,993
just to get me up to his room.

420
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,191
Okay, okay, now, what about
Colonel Ryder?

421
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,958
- You were in his room...
- Katie.

422
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,559
Oh, it's Harry.

423
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,875
More later.

424
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,873
That young Ryder's on his way down
the lobby to meet you.

425
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,753
Now, I got some last-minute
negotiating instructions for you, kiddo.

426
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,191
Now, you get to the pension plan
before you finish yourfruit salad.

427
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,994
- Important.
- Pension plan, fruit salad. Yes, Harry.

428
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,033
You might have to give him
a hard sell on seniority rights,

429
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,879
so order something that'll take
a long time, like roast duck.

430
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,071
Seniority rights, roast duck.
Yes, Harry.

431
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,077
Now, here's our proposal
in black and white.

432
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,670
- Yes.
- Now, don't forget, stand pat.

433
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,518
Stand pat.

434
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,514
Thank you.

435
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,157
This pension plan looks
very interesting.

436
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,197
- You match us...
- Penny forpenny.

437
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,197
Employee and employer
moving forward

438
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,595
shoulder and shoulder,
hand in hand.

439
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,078
That's a very good idea.

440
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,350
By the way, where do you live,
Miss Robbins?

441
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,438
- Pardon me?
- Well, you know, subcommittee work,

442
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,394
I may have to get ahold of you
in a hurry some night.

443
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,152
463 East 76th.

444
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,915
Thank you.

445
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,675
- May I ask you a personal question?
- Certainly.

446
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,757
If your uncle hadn't been
Colonel Ryder,

447
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,951
what do you think
you'd be doing now?

448
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,309
Playing golf, I guess.

449
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,353
No, what I mean is, you don't seem
like management to me.

450
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,757
You mean, would I be in the
publishing business? Yes, I would.

451
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,835
Well, you're lucky to be able to start
at the top.

452
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,679
I started just one step below.
I worked as a messenger,

453
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,350
then a stock boy.
Printer's devil fortwo years.

454
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,990
Then I worked in the promotion
department, advertising, sales.

455
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,395
I moved into the editorial department.

456
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,512
I had the experience, but I had
to keep proving to the Ryders.

457
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,030
If you're a relative,
you're supposed to be an idiot.

458
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,117
I started at the top the hard way.

459
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,949
Still, it must have been nice to have
Colonel Ryder behind you all the time.

460
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,715
I worked for a rival chain.

461
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,037
Well, that's enough about me.
Now, you ordered roast duck.

462
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,834
Oh, yes, roast duck.
Seniority rights...

463
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,118
Excuse me.

464
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,837
Seniority rights.
There are the figures.

465
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,553
Oh, right here?

466
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,952
Yes.

467
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,920
Seniority rights are a basic issue,
you know, Mr. Ryder.

468
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,395
An old man is like an old car.

469
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,830
Just because his carburetor
gets rusty

470
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,678
and his spark plugs get stuck,
you don't just...

471
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,835
Voilà.

472
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,348
- Isthat a roast duck?
- Oui, from Normandy.

473
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,232
Petite, but delicious beyond words.

474
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,919
But it's so small.

475
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,634
Madame, petite mais délicieuse.

476
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,913
Well, I'lljust have to talk faster,
that's all.

477
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,954
- Where was I?
- Your spark plugs were stuck.

478
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,198
Yes.

479
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,508
You don't just throw an old man
on the scrapheap forthat.

480
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,952
No, you refuel his fuel pump
and you tighten up his confidence.

481
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,832
And then you give him
another chance.

482
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,672
Voilà, madame.

483
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,909
Seniority rights, fringe benefits
and pension plan.

484
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,475
It's all right here in black and white,
Mr. Ryder.

485
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,513
- Now, speaking forthe union...
- You are standing pat.

486
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,555
That's right, we're standing pat.
Thank you.

487
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,875
Hey, it's 2:30.

488
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,350
What do you say we take
the rest ofthe afternoon off.

489
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,232
I think we've earned it.

490
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,595
I'm curious about something.

491
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,189
Why did you pick on me
to do the negotiating?

492
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,119
I suppose because you were
the prettiest one there.

493
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,515
But you don't have to be pretty
to negotiate.

494
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,199
No, but you're brainy too.

495
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,154
And the nice part about that
is your brains don't show a bit.

496
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,077
Thank you.

497
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,953
But you see, I'm in Research,
Mr. Ryder,

498
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,391
and I've been doing quite a bit
of research on you.

499
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,676
And I'm afraid I'm not yourtype at all.

500
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,351
I know you like tall, svelte,
sophisticated blonds.

501
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:51,672
You're a good researcher, but don't
believe everything you read.

502
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,749
I said we earned an afternoon off,
so let's take it.

503
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,111
Now, what would you like to do?

504
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,556
Well, I would like to do
some shopping.

505
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,235
Shopping. Okay.
Just what I had in mind.

506
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,396
Why don't you use my car.

507
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,916
My chauffeur, O'Hara, he'll drive you
anywhere you wanna go.

508
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,634
And I'll drop off at the club,

509
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,711
take a cold shower.

510
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,230
- May I be of assistance?
- Yes, thank you.

511
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,556
You see, I thought that...

512
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,070
I thought that this was a bathing suit
that I had bought...

513
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,717
...on sale in Palm Beach.
Just one moment.

514
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,709
But when I opened the box,
I discovered

515
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,713
it wasn't the bathing suit
I bought on sale in Palm Beach.

516
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,309
- It was Mr. Hackett's mink.
- Mr. Hackett's mink.

517
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,875
Yes. Now, I saved his life,
and Dr. Schweitzer

518
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,878
or no Dr. Schweitzer,
I'm afraid I can't accept this coat.

519
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,958
Dr. Schweitzer. Excuse me,
this is a matterfor our manager.

520
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,038
- Mr. Carruthers, please.
- Yes. Yes?

521
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,595
There seems to be a problem
with this lady's coat.

522
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,792
No, there's no problem.
It's just that I can't accept this.

523
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,513
Isthere something wrong
with the coat?

524
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,756
Oh, no, not at all.
It's just beautiful.

525
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,953
But, you see, it's not mine.
It's Mr. Hackett's. He sent it to me.

526
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,515
- Oh, Mr. Kirby Hackett?
- Yes, that's right.

527
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,188
And you're Miss Robbins?

528
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,870
Oh, yes. Well, there's been
no mistake. The coat's yours.

529
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,753
Oh, but there is a mistake.
You see, I don't want it.

530
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,872
I see.
You want the money.

531
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,911
No, sir, I do not want the money.

532
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,509
But the coat is yours.
It's already paid for.

533
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,030
I haven't done anything to earn it.

534
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,749
Oh, I mean, all I did wastake him up
to his room and put him to...

535
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,279
He'd been drinking, you see,

536
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,675
and it seemed like the only place
we could...

537
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,990
- I saved his life! Well, I did.
- Yes, yes.

538
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,350
Will you tell Mr. Hackett
I returned the coat?

539
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,198
I'm afraid that might be a bit difficult.

540
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,595
He left for Europe this morning
on the Liberté.

541
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,314
I don't care ifhe went
to Devil's Island in a canoe.

542
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,795
Please, may I have a receipt
forthe coat?

543
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,595
I'm sure this is not what
Mr. Hackett had in mind.

544
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,233
I know what Mr. Hackett had in mind.

545
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,795
- How much is the coat?
- Eleven thousand dollars.

546
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,790
- Eleven thousand dollars?
- Oh, that includesthe tax.

547
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,113
Well.

548
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,356
There's $10.
I would like to pay $5 a week.

549
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,115
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to think this over?

550
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,869
Why, at $5 a week,
it'll take you 45 yearsto pay for it.

551
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,792
I'm in no hurry if you're not.

552
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,637
You'll be through paying
for it in the year 2005.

553
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,438
Well...

554
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,635
There's another 5.
I'll have to try it on again.

555
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,760
And then I saw her buying a mink coat.

556
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,359
She paid cash for it.

557
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,552
Must have been thousand-dollar bills.

558
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,312
How can she afford a mink
on her salary?

559
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,839
Overtime.

560
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,837
Overtime?

561
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,072
Overtime.

562
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,873
Oh, no, not Miss Robbins.

563
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,478
No.

564
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,913
Bye, ladies.

565
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,957
- Bye, Marie, see you at 6.
- Bye.

566
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,912
Thank you.

567
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,709
- Now, what did you do about the coat?
- Nothing. I have to pay it off, that's all.

568
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,115
- But how?
- Ten dollars a week.

569
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,356
It's the principle ofthe thing, Marge.

570
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,994
I wish somebody would test
my principles.

571
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,836
Hey, I see you found a "good"
to go with your "luck. "

572
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,230
No, they didn't have a "good. "
I had to buy another "luck. "

573
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,595
"Luck-luck"?

574
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,916
As long as you keep out
of Chinese restaurants.

575
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,349
Pardon me.

576
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,636
He was a wonderful man,
the colonel.

577
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,195
Oh, wonderful.
He paid the lowest salaries in town.

578
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,749
Oh, Marge, that was
just his business sense.

579
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,748
Underneath, he was a sensitive,
idealistic and very lonely human being.

580
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,030
Are we talking about
the same Colonel Ryder?

581
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,878
Rememberwhen we ran
his biography?

582
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,992
When I was doing the research,
I came across some ofthe poems

583
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,713
he had done in college.

584
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,876
- Poems? The colonel?
- Yes.

585
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,629
Of course, he wouldn't let us use any
ofthem. But talk about raw emotion!

586
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,195
Keep moving.
Expressto the 30th floor.

587
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,030
Love is like a wild volcano
Seething with dark desire

588
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,033
Well, if you don't mind, I'd rather
remember him for his low salaries.

589
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,435
Hey, kiddo. I've been looking for you.
Come on.

590
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,198
I got a cab, we're gonna be late.

591
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,834
- Forwhat?
- The funeral. Union's got three seats.

592
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,713
- You're one ofthem.
- Oh, Harry, I couldn't possibly.

593
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,151
- Why not?
- Because I'm very emotional, I'll cry.

594
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,157
Go ahead.
Afew tears won't hurt us a bit.

595
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,670
But, Harry, you don't understand.
It's not just tears. I mean, I cry.

596
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,792
At weddings, at funerals.
Once I even cried at a hockey match.

597
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,032
I don't know what it is orwhy I do it,
but I'm very emotional.

598
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,958
Just like my wife, only she giggles.

599
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,388
- At funerals?
- Yeah.

600
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,229
And I'll tell you one thing, kiddo:
She better stay away from my funeral.

601
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,791
And in World War I, what happened?

602
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,190
The great man that we have gathered
to honortoday

603
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,872
volunteered once more
for military duty.

604
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,313
And in six months ofhard,
grinding toil, he brought chaos...

605
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,755
He brought orderto the chaos

606
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,918
that beset our overseas
parcel-post service.

607
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,669
And that Christmas,
I may now reveal,

608
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,317
not a single dough boy
in the front lines...

609
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,472
...not one...

610
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,710
...had to do without a slice
ofMom's fruit cake.

611
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,311
Easy on the waterworks, kiddo.

612
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,233
I'm sorry, Harry, I can't help it.

613
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,318
Once I even cried at an auto show.

614
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,556
And then, at long last,
came theArmistice.

615
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,518
It's gotta be her.

616
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,069
And ifl were to summarize
Colonel Charles J. Ryder's career...

617
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,036
...in one apt phrase, I would say:

618
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,598
"First in war, first in peace
and first in the publishing game. "

619
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,078
You go on, Harry.
I wanna dry off a little bit.

620
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,869
That's our girl.

621
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,435
- You recognize her?
- Even with her clothes on.

622
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,154
And the earring too.
It's a perfect match, see?

623
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,510
That about wraps it up.
She's our blackmailer.

624
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,950
No, not Miss Robbins.
She's not the type.

625
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,311
They never are. We'll be hearing
from that young lady.

626
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,317
I don't see why you're so upset.

627
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,670
If a person can't even sniffle
at a funeral...

628
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,791
Marge, it wasn't a sniffle,
it was loud.

629
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,070
I practically did a duet
with the bugler.

630
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,437
Well, it is perfectly natural.
Especially in your case.

631
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,035
There's no use arguing.
I'm going straight upstairs

632
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,992
and apologize to Mr. Ryder.

633
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,917
Now, to conclude report.

634
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,838
Cased blackmailer's apartment.

635
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,315
Lives alone, except for small bird.

636
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,432
Think it was parakeet.
Might've been canary.

637
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,676
Couldn't make out
through binoculars.

638
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,553
You mean you were spying on her?

639
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,796
Orders from the board, sir.

640
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,434
- Our orders, Tony.
- That's right.

641
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,154
Blackmailer came home
about 7:12 p. m.

642
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,998
Made dinner. Ate dinner.

643
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,953
Washed hair. Washed dishes.
Went to bed.

644
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,037
No visitors?

645
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,634
No visitors, no phone calls.

646
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,594
Well, that's about the size ofit.
Better get down to work.

647
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,671
Will you please leave
by the side door.

648
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,558
I still can't believe she did it.

649
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,398
- Oh, no.
- Mr. Ryder.

650
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,717
The bank is postponing the meeting
about our loan until tomorrow.

651
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,434
Gentlemen, I'd say Miss Robbins
had us over a barrel.

652
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,358
We're lucky ifwe don't end up
in one.

653
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,518
Now, let's be fair. Are we sure
this isthe girl we're looking for?

654
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,314
- Of course we are.
- Lasker identified her, didn't he?

655
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,829
People have been hanged
on cases of mistaken identity.

656
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,156
- Mr. Ryder...
- And I say that a person is innocent

657
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,635
until proven guilty.
How do we know she's guilty?

658
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,552
- Those earrings.
- Could be a coincidence.

659
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,274
They probably sell thousands
ofthese. Ten thousand!

660
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,756
And here's something else.
If she really wasthe blackmailer,

661
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,037
where would she be now?
In my office waiting to see me.

662
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,798
- Mr. Ryder.
- Yes?

663
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,798
Miss Robbins is in your office
waiting to see you.

664
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,592
In my office, waiting to see me.

665
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,279
She said it was important.

666
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,078
To see me...

667
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,430
Careful, Tony.
This is sticky business.

668
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,269
- And she's plenty tricky.
- Sticky, tricky.

669
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,513
Good morning, Mr...

670
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,151
Good morning, Mr...

671
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,952
Good morning. I think I know
why you're here, Miss Robbins.

672
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,071
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

673
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,595
- Sit down.
- Yes.

674
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,830
I wanted to come up and get it
overwith before I lost my nerve.

675
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,839
Thank you. I know what you
must think of me, Mr. Ryder.

676
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,315
But honestly, I couldn't help
what happened.

677
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,149
- It was all my uncle's fault.
- No, it wasn't anybody's fault.

678
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,033
Oh, believe me, I didn't wanna go.

679
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,390
But afterall, he wasthe head
ofthe company.

680
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,672
- And you were dazzled, huh?
- Dazzled?

681
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,752
Orshall we say, impressed?

682
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,633
Well, that is a betterword, I guess.

683
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,233
But, you see, the real trouble,
Mr. Ryder, sir,

684
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,271
isthat I'm...

685
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,994
I'm too sentimental.

686
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,790
Sentimental. Oh, I'm sure you
could think of a betterword.

687
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,673
Well, how about emotional?
That's what I am.

688
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,711
That's it, I'm over-emotional.

689
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,830
Especially when I think about all those
wonderful poems Colonel Ryderwrote.

690
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,200
- Po...? He wrote poems?
- Oh, yes.

691
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,994
Oh, they were so sensitive
and passionate.

692
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,989
Passionate poems?

693
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,637
Love is a wild volcano
Seething with dark desire

694
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,037
And you and I, the twain...
That means 'the two. "

695
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,719
I get the idea.

696
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,797
Miss Robbins, how many poems
are there?

697
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,718
- Dozens.
- Dozens?

698
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,391
Yes. You know, your uncle was a very
warm and tender man, Mr. Ryder.

699
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,113
Oh, you should read his letters.

700
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,356
- Letters too?
- Yes, would you like to see them?

701
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,034
No, thanks, and I wouldn't want
anyone else to see them, either.

702
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,993
Oh, well, you mustn't worry about that.
I have them in a safe place.

703
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,191
I'm sure you do.

704
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,873
Mr. Ryder. Suppose we published
all ofthose letters and poems

705
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:42,313
so that the entire world could see what
kind of a man your uncle really was.

706
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,754
Well, it was just a suggestion.

707
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,588
Miss Robbins, I've had enough
ofthis cat-and-mouse game.

708
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,994
Well, it was just a suggestion.

709
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,316
We both know why
you came up here, right?

710
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,953
Now that we know
where we both stand...

711
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,673
Yes.
Well, I'll get back to work.

712
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,348
- No, we'll talk.
- Talk?

713
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,034
What'll we talk about,
fringe benefits?

714
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,913
- We'll talk about loyalty.
- All right.

715
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,358
My uncle's reputation and the Ryder
Enterprises are very closely linked.

716
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,909
If anything should happen
to destroy this company,

717
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,957
hundreds ofpeople would be
thrown out of work.

718
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,276
Now, you wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

719
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,038
- Why, no.
- Good.

720
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,913
Then your loyalty
will be suitably rewarded.

721
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,237
I didn't come here to ask for any...

722
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,396
- In the form of a raise?
- I don't want...

723
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,073
Shall we say $50 a week more?

724
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,998
- Fifty dollars?
- A hundred dollars?

725
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,475
I think you're a little unstrung
by the funeral. If you...

726
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,472
Two hundred dollars a week.
Take it or leave it.

727
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,716
- Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it!
- Good, good.

728
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,992
Now, remember, don't talk
about thisto anyone.

729
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,755
Don't worry, I won't.

730
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,033
But I think you should.
Talk.

731
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,392
To a doctor!

732
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,794
Well, why don't you
look it up yourself.

733
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,072
How do you like that?
Some wise guy trying to tell me

734
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,953
we had a president
named Andrew Johnson.

735
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,988
I realize that you're new
in Research, Mr. Lasker,

736
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,079
but ifthere are any more phone calls,
especially about presidents...

737
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,839
...I'll be glad to take them.
- Oh, gotcha.

738
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,079
Excuse me.

739
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,598
Thank you.

740
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,313
Oh, by the way...

741
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,116
...do you and Mrs. Lasker bowl?

742
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,191
I do. She doesn't.

743
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,396
There is no Mrs. Lasker.

744
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,835
Oh, that is peachy.

745
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,474
That you bowl, I mean.

746
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,558
I love bowling.

747
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,478
It's so healthy.

748
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,955
And maybe some night
you could join Katie and me

749
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,273
- and her boyfriend some night.
- Oh, sure. Any time.

750
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,038
Tonight?

751
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,034
Marge. The strangest thing
just happened.

752
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,073
- Hello.
- Miss Robbins, this is Mr. Lasker.

753
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,748
- Mr. Lasker, this is Miss Robbins.
- How do you do?

754
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,793
And guess where we're
all going tonight. Bowling.

755
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,356
Oh, Marge, I'm sorry, I can't tonight.

756
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,869
I have a date with Warren.

757
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,510
This fella, Warren,
does he work here?

758
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,756
No.
Dr. Kingsley's a friend of mine.

759
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,633
He's herfiancé.
They're going to be married.

760
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,115
Oh, marriage is
a wonderful institution.

761
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,316
When'sthe happy event?

762
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,272
Oh, we haven't even set the date yet.

763
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,711
When'sthe happy event?

764
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,831
Oh, we haven't even set the date yet.

765
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,032
Dr. Kingsley's folks are in town.
Katie's afraid they won't like her.

766
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,879
I'm not afraid, exactly.
But they're from a small town.

767
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,116
You know, sort of strait-laced.

768
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,039
Small town, strait-laced.
Rememberthat.

769
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,959
I hope I make a good impression
when I meet them tonight, that's all.

770
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,479
Why shouldn't you?

771
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,717
Because it'll probably be days
before I can pull myselftogether

772
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,753
afterthat ten minutes Ijust spent
with that nut upstairs.

773
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,716
- Which nut upstairs?
- Tony Ryder, that's which nut.

774
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,477
Then somebody called Research
and Miss Robbins got too busy to talk.

775
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,798
I wonderwhy she called Tony,
excuse me, Tony, a nut.

776
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,752
I don't care what she
called me orwhy.

777
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,430
We haven't learned a single thing
from that electronic house dick.

778
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,797
We have a lead that could be
very good forus, Mr. Ryder.

779
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,879
We found out that this babe is
engaged to a very respectable guy.

780
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,118
- So?
- So get her married off and bingo,

781
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,351
she's off your back and out
of your cash register.

782
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,074
Sure. "Miss Robbins, how would
you like your husband to know

783
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,915
about that little episode at Palm
Beach?" I guessthat'll hush herup.

784
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,349
Counter-blackmail is an ugly word,
gentlemen.

785
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,232
Suppose we're on the wrong track.
Suppose this Dr. What's-his-name...

786
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,192
- Kingsley.
- Suppose he'sthe brains

787
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,278
behind this blackmail scheme and
Miss Robbins is nothing but a pawn.

788
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,357
- That's hardly likely.
- Likely or not,

789
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,869
I intend to do a little investigating
of my own.

790
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,550
I wanna meet this guy, size him up and
see what we have to contend with.

791
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,716
- Yes, sir?
- Would you get me the address

792
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,036
- of a Dr. Warren Kingsley.
- Yes, sir.

793
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,834
Thank you. Meeting adjourned.

794
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,516
Amateurs.

795
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,679
Well, there you are.

796
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,553
Have you any idea how you're
going to get in the place?

797
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,513
Simple. He's a doctor,
I can have a stomachache.

798
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,712
Careful, or you'll end up
with your appendix missing.

799
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,038
Very funny, Mr. O'Hara. Now, you
wait for me down the street there.

800
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,078
Now, cheer up, Bobo.

801
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,829
The nice doctorsays it's all
in your mind. Yes.

802
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,315
Come on, Bobo.

803
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,992
Hey, son, do you mind ifl borrow
your dog for a few minutes?

804
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,191
I'll give you a quarter.
What do you say?

805
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,119
Gee, thanks.
But, mister, it's not my dog.

806
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,788
You mean it's not your horse.

807
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,554
Emergency case. I'd like to see
the doctorright away.

808
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,796
And what isthe nature
ofthe emergency?

809
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,309
Well, it's rather personal.

810
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,516
I'd preferto see the doctor.
Oh, doc!

811
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,756
Young man, you're finally out
ofthe woods.

812
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,871
You just stick to that vitamin therapy

813
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,553
and you'll feel like a new dog.

814
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,478
Thank you, doctor.

815
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,672
- Yes, do you have an appointment?
- Emergency case, very important.

816
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,599
Come on, doc. Oh, doc.

817
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,669
Now, you take it easy, old boy.
Good old doc'll fix you up. Attaboy.

818
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,916
Did you have an appointment,
Mr?

819
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,749
Heminschlogger.
Julius T. Heminschlogger.

820
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,474
Yeah, and as I mentioned,
this is an emergency case.

821
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,708
I see. What seemsto be his problem,
Mr. Heminschlogger?

822
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,632
Well...

823
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,831
...amnesia.

824
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,353
- Your dog has amnesia?
- It happened all of a sudden.

825
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,152
I wastaking him fora walk,

826
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,318
and he gave me
that 'who are you?" look.

827
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,557
- The 'who are you?" look?
- Yeah, like this:

828
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,070
Don't mind telling you
it shook me up.

829
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,595
Canine amnesia. That's very rare.
I don't think they everwrote that up.

830
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,438
Well, now's your chance, doc.

831
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,030
Not only to help me,
but advance the cause of medical...

832
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,152
Will you hold still, Julius.
What are you...?

833
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,432
Not in the pocket, Julius.
You see there, doc?

834
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,993
He thinks he's a pickpocket.

835
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,792
Julius? Isn't that your name?

836
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,276
Is it? Yeah, it is.
Well, this is Julius Jr.

837
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,031
I'm the sentimental type
and we're very close, you know.

838
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,994
See, doc?
Now he thinks I'm Lassie.

839
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,633
Kind of a memory block, huh?

840
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,832
- May I?
- Yeah.

841
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,355
All right, now, Julius, just calm down.
You're among friends now.

842
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,279
Just relax. Just relax.

843
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,678
Tell me, Mr. Heminschlogger,
has he had a physical lately?

844
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,274
Well, not in six months. You better
check him over. Take yourtime.

845
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,599
- Lfthis doesn't work, we'll try analysis.
- Oh, anything.

846
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,633
Long as we get my buddy back
on his feet.

847
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,873
"Kansas Institute
of Veterinary Science. "

848
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,911
That must be a wonderful
old school.

849
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,918
Sure is.
My father's the president.

850
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,593
Oh, he is?

851
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,473
Now, let'stake a look at
those tonsils. Now, now, Julius.

852
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,671
Biting won't solve anything.

853
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,877
Just relax.

854
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,271
Oh, doc. This picture,
I've seen this girl before.

855
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,994
- Where?
- Well, isn't she a chorus girl

856
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,276
at the Copacabana?

857
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,869
No, I'm afraid not.
That's my fiancée.

858
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,879
Oh, well, I could be mistaken.

859
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,196
No, my family's very strait-laced.

860
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,789
I'm afraid they would never allow me
to be engaged

861
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,553
to a girl from the Copacabana.

862
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,473
Rocky! Rocky!

863
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,908
All right, where is he?!

864
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,714
What do you want?
This is a respectable clinic.

865
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,996
I'm looking fora dognapper,
that's what I'm looking for.

866
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,270
- What's in there?
- You can't go in there.

867
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,835
- Police!
- Who snatched my dog?

868
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,837
- Get out ofthere.
- Police!

869
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,508
- Rocky, baby.
- Keep your hands offmy patient.

870
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,673
- Police!
- You dognapper.

871
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,757
I want words with you.

872
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,991
I don't know what you did to my dog,

873
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,869
but I want everything
put back the way it was.

874
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,354
- Police!
- Thanks forthe advice

875
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,994
about my parakeet, doc.
I'll keep him out of drafts.

876
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,317
In there, officer. You'd better hurry.

877
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,556
Oh, doctor. Dr. Kingsley.

878
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,836
- Hello.
- Well, here we are.

879
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,554
Won't you come in. How do you do?

880
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,988
How are you?

881
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,794
Happy to know you, Miss...
What wasthe lady's name?

882
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,479
- Miss Robbins.
- Miss Robbins.

883
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,272
Happy to know you.
Come right in.

884
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,715
Well, thank you.

885
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,155
I'm delighted to know you.

886
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,759
Miss Robbins, this is Mother.

887
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,428
Oh, I'm delighted to know
your mothertoo.

888
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,755
Oh, I mean...

889
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,109
She's my mother, Katie.

890
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,436
I know, Warren, I know.
I meant to say that...

891
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,312
Did you hearthat, Mother?

892
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,590
Girl here thought you were
Warren's grandma.

893
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,076
No, I didn't. Honest, I didn't.
You're too old.

894
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,953
I mean, you're both too old.

895
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,434
Oh, what I mean is...

896
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,551
I'll explain it later.
Could we sit down?

897
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,149
Yes, of course, sit down.
Could I take yourwrap?

898
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,674
No, thank you.

899
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,758
- Your hat?
- Yes, put it anywhere.

900
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,990
Well, isn't she everything
I said she was?

901
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,669
I'm sorry I don't have
any more room.

902
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,758
No, no, it's very nice.

903
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,872
In Kansas, we have 30 acres.

904
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,712
Well, I could use some
ofthose here.

905
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,956
That's very funny.

906
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,437
Well, I would say that
refreshments are in order.

907
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,073
What have you got in mind?

908
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,278
Well, I made a nice big pitcher
of cold mar...

909
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,999
Hot chocolate.

910
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,159
Of cold hot chocolate. Yes.
That's right.

911
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,759
So you have your choice

912
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,669
of cold hot chocolate
or hot hot chocolate.

913
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,871
Hot, please.

914
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,717
Well, I'll have cold, I guess.

915
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,229
That'stwo chocolates.

916
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,000
One hot and one cold,
coming right up.

917
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,232
Isn't she nice?

918
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,952
I forgot.

919
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,993
I'm all out of chocolate.

920
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,999
Oh, would you like olives?
Would you like an olive?

921
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,997
No, thanks.

922
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,513
No, thank you. They stick in my...
No, thank you.

923
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,278
Yes.

924
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,509
Well, I guess we're off
to our little French restaurant.

925
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,030
Oh, little French restaurants,
that's all we've had on thistrip.

926
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,596
It seems to me we ought to go
to some big noisy nightclub.

927
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,115
Do you know any nightclubs,
Miss Robbins?

928
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,117
There's the Martinique.

929
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,116
But I've never been there.
Never.

930
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,834
I've heard about it. Let's go there.

931
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,996
Dad, it's very popular.
I doubt if we'd get in.

932
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,952
You just tell them
that your dad heads up

933
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,196
the Kansas Institute
of Veterinary Science.

934
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,915
That'll make them sit up and bark.
Yeah, sit up and b...

935
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,833
Did you hearthat, Mother,
"sit up and bark"?

936
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,754
- She said she's never been there.
- No.

937
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,476
I'm a working girl. And working girls
just don't have time for nightclubs.

938
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,436
That's right.

939
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,474
Yeah, well, should I get your coat,
Katie?

940
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,352
Thank you, Warren.

941
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,955
I don't need...

942
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,993
- Mink?
- May I?

943
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,475
May I have a feel ofthat?

944
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,192
Oh, my. Tourmaline mink.
They run into money.

945
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,148
What is it you do for a living?

946
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,157
Research.

947
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,954
Obviously pays very well.

948
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,353
Katie, where did you get the coat?

949
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,313
I bought it on time, Warren.
I wastrying to explain.

950
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,512
Ten dollars a week.
I wanted to surprise you.

951
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,837
Yeah. You surprised me.

952
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,357
Shall we go?

953
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,553
Oh, do you know that I...?

954
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,671
Oh, I beg yourpardon.

955
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,351
- What's the matter, darling?
- Nothing.

956
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,512
I just have a little business
to take care of.

957
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,916
Could we have a table forfour,
please?

958
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,873
I'd be very happy to accept
a small bribe tomorrow night.

959
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,798
Next week would be even better.

960
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,514
- Oh, but we...
- Tonight is quite impossible.

961
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,948
Oh, it is?

962
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,116
George, do me a favor, huh?

963
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,279
You see that girl there, with
the fur coat? That's Miss Robbins.

964
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,994
Now, she's got to get married.

965
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,955
Yeah, and they love each other.
Now, we've gotta play Cupid.

966
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,995
See, we'll get her a good table,
some good music and real fine wine.

967
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,236
Then let nature take its course,
you understand?

968
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,556
Perfectly.

969
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,638
Let's go to the Stork Club.
Motherand I have neverbeen there.

970
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,111
Well, I'm more than glad to be leaving.
This isn't my kind of place.

971
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,108
You're so right, Mrs. Kingsley.
It's not my kind of, either.

972
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,034
Miss Robbins.
One moment, please.

973
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,037
- Me?
- Athousand pardons.

974
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,073
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

975
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,438
Me?

976
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,829
Captain, table 30
for Miss Robbins and herparty.

977
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,958
Us?

978
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,589
But I've never been here before.

979
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,430
Katie probably looks like one
oftheir regular customers.

980
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,313
Whose name just happens
to be Robbins?

981
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,317
Champagne.

982
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,435
Oh, we didn't order any champagne.

983
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,598
For Miss Robbins.
Compliments ofthe Martinique.

984
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,349
Oh, well, I know.

985
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,950
I'm probably the one millionth person
to come in here tonight.

986
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,754
- Tonight?
- Well, I mean, since it opened,

987
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,555
or something. You know, how
they're always giving things away?

988
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,274
No. No, I don't.

989
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,675
Well, they do. All the time.

990
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,553
Just last week there wasthis girl,
and she was crossing this bridge

991
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,830
in this car,
and they gave it to her.

992
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,669
- The bridge?
- No, the car.

993
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,233
Anew one too, that is.

994
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,750
She was probably the ten millionth
person to cross the bridge.

995
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,518
Orwas it a tunnel?

996
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,109
Yeah, well, Mom, ifKatie says
she's never been here before,

997
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,118
- she's never been here before.
- No, I haven't.

998
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,790
And it was a tunnel.
And this girl...

999
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,596
To the Veterinary Institute in Kansas.

1000
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,870
I'll drink to that.

1001
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,476
Everything satisfactory, Mr. Ryder?

1002
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,272
Yeah, I think we've given Cupid
a good start.

1003
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,232
Now, you keep those arrows coming.

1004
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,591
I heard them say they were going
to the Stork Club from here.

1005
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,233
Good.

1006
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,598
Come on, honey,
let's go to the Stork Club.

1007
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,438
We can't keep ourfriends waiting.

1008
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,676
We don't have any friends
at the Stork Club.

1009
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,195
- We'll make some.
- I liked it here.

1010
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,157
Oh, darling, I forgot my purse.

1011
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,079
Oh, I'll get it for you.
I'll meet you out in front.

1012
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,360
Heminschlogger!
It's Heminschlogger.

1013
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,675
I'll drink to that.

1014
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,070
No, Dad, it'sthat crackpot
I told you about.

1015
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,555
- Where?
- Sneaking out.

1016
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,998
He waved at me.

1017
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,272
I believe he was waving at me.

1018
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,313
Don't be silly, honey. How would
you know Heminschlogger?

1019
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,516
Heminschlogger?
That's not Heminschlogger.

1020
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,156
- That's my boss, Tony Ryder.
- Oh, no. No, you're mistaken.

1021
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,794
How could I be mistaken about
a man that just this morning

1022
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,036
gave me a $200-a-week raise?

1023
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,755
- Two hundred?
- Aweek?

1024
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,151
I'll drink to that.

1025
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,918
But I didn't take it.

1026
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,071
And I've never been
to this place before,

1027
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,157
and I'm so sorry
we came here again.

1028
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,272
Warren, couldn't we go someplace
else for dinner and have supper?

1029
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,351
It's just making me
very, very nervous.

1030
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,710
Yeah, I'm a little nervous myself.

1031
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,480
Waiter. Check.

1032
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,395
Never a check for Miss Robbins.

1033
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,678
I'll drink to that.

1034
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,559
Me too.
One forthe road.

1035
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:48,439
Hail to thee, O Kansas Institute

1036
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,915
Of Veterinary Science.

1037
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:58,390
With your students scattered wide

1038
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,308
- I wonder if we could get in here.
- Really, Warren.

1039
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,629
She only had two drinks, Mom.

1040
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,592
It's just that she never had
champagne before.

1041
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,358
I wonder.

1042
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,794
They're always ready

1043
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:19,196
With needle and insecticide

1044
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,635
We'll go quietly, officer.

1045
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,074
Perhaps some othernight, sir.
Or better yet, some afternoon.

1046
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,838
- But thank you, sir.
- Oh, no.

1047
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,031
We're not tourists, old man,
you know.

1048
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,355
I should say not.

1049
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,473
I happen to be the president ofthe
Kansas Institute of Veterinary Science.

1050
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,240
- That's right.
- He is. He's the president.

1051
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,590
No luck, huh? All right.

1052
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,951
Are they always this snooty?

1053
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,276
I don't know, I've never
been here before.

1054
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,469
Either.

1055
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,551
That's the party I told you about.

1056
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,875
Oh, yes, sir.

1057
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,111
Come on, honey,
let's get out ofhere.

1058
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,318
It's getting awfully stuffy.
Let's go back to La Martinique.

1059
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,159
Miss Robbins.
Please forgive the captain.

1060
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:12,638
He's a new man. It's nice
to see you again, Miss Robbins.

1061
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:18,238
It's nice to see you...
It's nice to see you again.

1062
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,910
- How're the wife and kids?
- Just fine. This way.

1063
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,474
She's never been here, either.

1064
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,077
Thank you very much.

1065
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,673
- She's a great girl.
- Congratulations are in orderfor me.

1066
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,071
I'm the ten millionth lady
to cross this bridge.

1067
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:52,435
Hail to thee, O Kansas Institute...

1068
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,717
Ryder, Tony Ryder.

1069
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,797
Yeah, I'm sure he'll talk to me.

1070
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,399
They're trying to reach Pudge.

1071
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,108
Good. Try and find out
what's holding up that loan.

1072
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,232
Now, about getting ourblackmailer
married off, I think that...

1073
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,830
Not a chance, Mr. Dunning.
Not for a long time, anyway.

1074
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,155
How do you know?

1075
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,590
Talked to the waiter
at the Stork Club.

1076
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,553
He told me Mrs. Kingsley and her son
were very unhappy

1077
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,957
about Miss Robbins
doing the cha-cha in the kitchen...

1078
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,834
...with the cook.

1079
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,271
Oh, it'll be a cornless day in Kansas
before that girl gets married.

1080
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,677
Let's face it, gentlemen.
Cupid-wise, we are in trouble.

1081
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,269
Our counter-blackmail scheme
doesn't have a prayer.

1082
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,710
We've got to get that young lady
out ofthe way.

1083
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,433
I know a gangster.

1084
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,789
Well, he's not really a gangster.
He's my wife's brother...

1085
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,117
Hello. Hello.
Oh, hi, Pudge.

1086
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,115
What'sthe good word on our loan?

1087
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,756
Oh, I see.

1088
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,519
Well, could you tell me
what kind of a hitch?

1089
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,070
I understand, Pudge. Thanks.

1090
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,435
Well, they've decided to hold off
on the loan.

1091
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,074
Gentlemen, I guess I'm not
the best man forthis job after all.

1092
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,549
Now, this is no time to give up, Tony.

1093
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,910
Didn't yourfriend Pudge give you
any reasons?

1094
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,230
Well, he said they were
checking on a rumor.

1095
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,158
- Didn't know what it was.
- Arumor?

1096
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,114
We have got to keep her
from talking, orwe're sunk.

1097
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,470
What ifwe tried
this little thing again?

1098
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,872
Let the little lady incriminate herself.

1099
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,758
We've already tried that.
She wouldn't talk.

1100
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,235
With me we tried,
and with me she wouldn't talk.

1101
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,000
But what if we got somebody else
wired for sound?

1102
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,274
Somebody suave, clever,
good-looking, huh?

1103
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,198
Somebody she could really go for.

1104
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,231
I've got a cute little spot
in the Village.

1105
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,590
Ridiculous.

1106
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,278
Looks like you're drafted, Tony.

1107
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,799
I'd like to help you...

1108
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,312
- Mr. Ryder.
- For personal reasons, I'd rather not.

1109
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,717
Listen to this.

1110
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,435
"Dear Mr. Ryder, I've been thinking
about the $200-a-week raise

1111
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:17,389
you offered me.
Of course, I can't possibly accept it.

1112
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,795
Naturally, I realize you
must have been joking. "

1113
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,195
- Joking?
- Go on, go on.

1114
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,111
Oh, here's where she slips
in the knife.

1115
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,432
"I suppose next you'll be offering me
the Ryder Building,

1116
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,315
lock, stock and magazines. Ha! Ha!"

1117
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,232
"Ha! Ha!"?

1118
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,277
See for yourself.

1119
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,754
It's "ha-ha," all right.

1120
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,276
Well, this girl is going to "ha-ha" us
right into the poorhouse.

1121
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,158
Not if we move fast.

1122
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,794
'Yourstruly, Katie Robbins. "

1123
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,110
Well, Tony?

1124
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,033
How do you wearthis thing?

1125
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,638
Good boy! Good boy!

1126
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,513
Now the question is:
Where should he go into action?

1127
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,756
I think Mr. Ryder ought
to take her someplace

1128
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,350
where she thinks they'll be alone.
Just the two ofthem.

1129
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,232
Then she'll really open up.

1130
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,315
I think I know just the spot
where I can catch Miss Robbins

1131
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,553
with her "ha-ha" down.
My apartment, tonight.

1132
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,117
And a little champagne to loosen
hertongue, eh, Mr. Ryder, huh?

1133
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,710
Yeah, and ifthat don't work,
I can alwaystry torture.

1134
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,434
That's very funny. Torture.

1135
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,358
I'm not in a funny mood, Mr. Lasker.

1136
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,994
As far as Katie is...
Miss Robbins is concerned,

1137
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,395
I may be involved
in this underhanded scheme,

1138
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,795
but I certainly don't have
to enjoy it.

1139
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,673
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir,
I see what you mean.

1140
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,111
Good luck.

1141
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,951
I'll get it, Kim.

1142
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,399
Now, look, after you've served
dinnerto the young lady and myself,

1143
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,113
you get lost.

1144
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,038
Same like always. Get lost.

1145
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,276
No, no, this is business.

1146
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,597
Same like always.
Monkey business.

1147
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,116
- I hope I'm not late.
- Oh, no, not at all.

1148
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,839
Come on in.

1149
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,432
Thank you.

1150
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,312
I realize I shouldn't have worn mink
to a business meeting,

1151
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,875
but it's my very first one.

1152
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,834
I'm sure it won't be your last.
"Ha! Ha!"

1153
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,590
- Pardon me?
- "Ha! Ha!"

1154
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,554
Oh, yes. "Ha! Ha!"

1155
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,990
Oh, my.

1156
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,477
This is a lovely room.

1157
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,398
Oh, are there just the two
ofus again?

1158
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,471
Surprised?

1159
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,315
Oh, well, no.
No, it's just that you...

1160
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,034
When you called me
about the urgent company business,

1161
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,630
well, I had this bowling date,
and I thought...

1162
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,278
Well, I don't know what I thought.
Health and Welfare, maybe.

1163
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,795
Your health and yourwelfare,
Miss Robbins?

1164
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,638
No, everybody's health and welfare.

1165
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,319
"Ha! Ha!"

1166
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,317
"Ha! Ha!"?

1167
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,117
"Ha! Ha!"

1168
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,075
Oh, this is beautiful.

1169
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,595
It's a Remington.

1170
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,473
Yes, he painted this around 1.900.

1171
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,076
Oh, I forgot. You're in Research.

1172
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,676
No, my father used to collect
Remington sketches.

1173
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,156
Of course, he could never afford
the original oils.

1174
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,720
Isn't this beautiful?

1175
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:59,037
Shall we? Nothing like a little
champagne to loosen yourton...

1176
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,196
Whet your appetite.

1177
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,676
Champagne?

1178
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,997
Well, I'm not very thirsty, Mr. Ryder.

1179
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,758
Matter of fact,
I'm not very hungry, either.

1180
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,077
So why don't we just get our business
overwith, and I'll run along.

1181
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,469
Oh, what'sthe rush?

1182
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,149
Well, I'm not in a rush,
but I thought maybe you were.

1183
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,193
Oh, no, I'm not in a rush,
Miss Robbins. Here.

1184
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,398
Drink up.

1185
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,871
Oh, your uncle certainly was
a strong man, wasn't he?

1186
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:45,756
Yeah. Strong like a bull
and weak like a man.

1187
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,437
You remind me ofhim.
You have the same strength.

1188
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,596
You see? The jaw.

1189
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,875
I mean, it's similar.

1190
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,990
Oh, your power's going.

1191
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,149
Oh, I really can't stay.
I have this bowling date,

1192
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,828
and I'm sort ofthe anchorman... Girl.

1193
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,759
Relax, Miss Robbins.
On a beautiful evening like this,

1194
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,918
it's no crime to enjoy the view
and sip champagne

1195
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:50,513
before we settle down
to more important matters. "Ha! Ha!"

1196
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,438
All right.

1197
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,791
Here'sto crime!
How'sthat fora "ha-ha"?

1198
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,638
- "Ha! Ha!"
- "Ha! Ha!"

1199
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,316
But, Warren, I was in the office when
he called, and he said it was business.

1200
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,353
When a man like Tony Ryder asks
a girl like Katie up to his apartment,

1201
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,198
you know what kind ofbusiness.

1202
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,879
Step on it, driver.

1203
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,594
But I asked Mr. Lasker
to go bowling.

1204
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,031
Why can't we bowl without Katie,
and mind our own business?

1205
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,389
Because Katie is my business.

1206
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,591
But just an hour ago, you said
you were through with her.

1207
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,030
Well, that was an hour ago.

1208
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,117
Suppose we get there
and there's nothing going on.

1209
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,709
There better be.

1210
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,709
Oh, what a beautiful view this is.

1211
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,469
There'sthe Triborough Bridge

1212
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,878
and the Brooklyn Bridge
and the Queensborough Bridge.

1213
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,714
And the Brooklyn Bridge again.

1214
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,758
Again?

1215
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,954
Oh, that's their problem.

1216
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,279
Here we are.

1217
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,678
I really shouldn't. Like I said before,
I'm the anchorman.

1218
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,518
But...

1219
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,157
Now, then,

1220
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,874
let'stalk business.

1221
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,358
Oh, good. I could listen
to you talk business all night.

1222
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,550
I'll lay my cards on the table,
Miss Robbins.

1223
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,359
Katie.

1224
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:37,236
I'm Katie, and you're Mr. Ryder.

1225
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,149
Cards? What cards?

1226
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,998
I thought you wanted
to talk business.

1227
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,433
Let's face facts, huh?
No beating around the bush.

1228
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,517
Bush? What bush?

1229
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,075
You haven't answered me yet
about the cards.

1230
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,113
And I could listen
to you play cards all night.

1231
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,197
Let's get to the point, Miss Robbins.

1232
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,277
Katie.

1233
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,710
All right, I know when I'm licked.

1234
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,512
Now, it's your move.

1235
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,632
You name the figure,
and I'll make out the check.

1236
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,673
I could listen to you make out
checks all night.

1237
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,270
- Please, Miss Robbins.
- Please. Katie.

1238
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,554
All right. Katie.

1239
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,796
What do you want?

1240
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,116
I want...

1241
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,633
I wanna dance.

1242
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:36,078
And even though I'm the anchorman,
I think that you had better lead.

1243
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,156
Of course.

1244
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,955
Oh, me.

1245
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,674
Ajug ofwine, a loaf ofbread

1246
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,031
And thou beside me
Singing in the wilderness

1247
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,915
You know, that's one ofthe prettiest
poems your uncle everwrote.

1248
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,794
Orwas it youruncle?
No, that was Khayyam.

1249
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,399
Omar Khayyam.

1250
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,354
Born 1.157, died 1.906.

1251
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,189
Oh, orwas that the Chicago Fire?
I don't know.

1252
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,960
As long as I'm not on duty.

1253
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,955
You know, ifit weren't for my uncle,

1254
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:14,197
we could have met under more
pleasant circumstances.

1255
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,632
Oh, I think this is very pleasant.
Circumstantially, that is.

1256
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,556
Love is a wild volcano
Seething with...

1257
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,512
You may kiss me, Mr. Ryder,
if you'd like to.

1258
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,790
It's perfectly all right.

1259
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,312
Oh, Heminschlogger, you're slipping.

1260
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,317
Katie.

1261
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,274
Oh, Mr. Ryder. Mr. Ryder.

1262
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,956
First time I ever kissed
an anchorman.

1263
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,116
Oh, excuse me.

1264
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,595
I'm sorry, it'sthe champagne.

1265
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,833
Oh, I really shouldn't have done that.

1266
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,395
You see, I'm sort of engaged.

1267
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,556
At least, I was until last night.

1268
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,079
I think I'd better go.

1269
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,192
You know, I don't think you've seen
the rest of my Remingtons.

1270
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,834
Oh, but I saw the one
in the living room. I saw that one.

1271
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,237
I have a few more
that I'd like you to see.

1272
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:27,674
Here's one ofhis most famous
paintings, Pursuing the Indians.

1273
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,836
Well, I can sympathize with them.

1274
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,719
Oh, there are more this way.

1275
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,478
Here's my favorite one.

1276
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,030
His famous card game.

1277
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,710
Yes, I have seen this reproduced
so many times, it's like an old friend.

1278
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,514
Did you know he did
a few bronze statues?

1279
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,951
Yes, he's just as famous for
his bronze as he is for his paintings.

1280
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,674
And there's anotherbeauty
overthere.

1281
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,919
But I can barely see it.

1282
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,758
I know.

1283
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,393
Most men have etchings,
and you have Remingtons.

1284
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,551
Yeah, but most men aren't
as lucky as I am.

1285
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,671
Especially right now.

1286
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,553
Mr. Ryder, you know
what you should do?

1287
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,035
You should turn this into a theater.

1288
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,555
Atheater in the round.

1289
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,277
Your lighting effects
are most effective.

1290
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,112
Most.

1291
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,272
You have this system
in all yourrooms?

1292
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,832
Every room except the kitchen
and in there.

1293
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:53,634
You wouldn't really need it
in the kitchen and in there.

1294
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:54,955
No, you wouldn't.

1295
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,674
I really must be going, Mr. Ryder.

1296
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,757
We came here to have a meeting.

1297
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,188
We're having one, Katie.

1298
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,277
Yes, but I feel very embarrassed.

1299
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,674
I only came here to talk.

1300
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,472
Of course you did.

1301
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,956
Katie, let's forget the past.
What's done is done.

1302
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,991
The important thing is I love you.

1303
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,870
I didn't wanna fall in love with you,
but there it is.

1304
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,872
Mr. Ryder.

1305
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,633
Tony. I forgive you.

1306
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,590
You're so sweet.

1307
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,954
Forgive me forwhat?

1308
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,636
For everything, darling. Florida.

1309
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,558
- Florida?
- And the hotel.

1310
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,911
- The hotel?
- The rendezvous with my uncle.

1311
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,150
The rendezvous with your uncle?

1312
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,033
I forgive you
forthe whole ugly scheme.

1313
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,637
You think I had a rendezvous
with your uncle?

1314
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,273
Forget that.
You met my uncle.

1315
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:59,077
He was old and lonely.
You felt sorry forhim.

1316
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,238
You're a very emotional girl, right?

1317
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,872
Right! There's only one small detail
you've missed.

1318
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,595
I didn't happen to meet your uncle,
I planned it that way.

1319
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,870
- You planned it?
- Beautifully.

1320
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,354
You mean you heard
he was lonely...

1321
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,438
I heard he was loaded.
And after Cosmo...

1322
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,596
- Cosmo?
- That beatnik bongo player

1323
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,949
I used to be engaged to.

1324
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,630
He was great on the bongos, but very
low on the dough, like all the others.

1325
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,274
- There were a lot of others?
- You wanna count baseball players?

1326
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,112
If you do, then there
were quite a few others.

1327
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,151
I was crazy about baseball players.

1328
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,909
I used to like jockeystoo,
only I kept growing and they didn't.

1329
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,633
That's in the past.
I don't wanna hear it.

1330
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,239
Now, prizefighters are the worst

1331
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,749
because you have to catch them
when they're not in training.

1332
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,428
Well, I forgive you. We're all
a little weak. And I'm a little weak.

1333
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,591
Well, I'm not. I'm strong.

1334
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,394
Now, back to that rendezvous.
Why did I do it?

1335
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,196
- Blackmail?
- Blackmail?!

1336
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,709
Yeah, but I forgive you.
That's all in the past.

1337
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,309
Well, thanks a lot!

1338
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,512
And one more thing, Mr. Ryder,

1339
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,996
once a blackmailer,
always a blackmailer!

1340
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,395
- Katie!
- I want money. Real money.

1341
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,239
By the time I get through with you,
you'll be selling your magazines...

1342
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,436
Let go! On a street corner!

1343
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,915
Katie, you can't leave me now.

1344
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,790
No!

1345
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,479
- Katie.
- Let go or I'll punch you in the nose!

1346
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,233
Good evening.

1347
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,833
Good evening, Mr. Ryder,
Miss Robbins.

1348
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,559
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

1349
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,352
- Well.
- And they say bowling

1350
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,272
isthe most popular indoorsport.

1351
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,192
I was helping herwith her coat.

1352
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,079
Well, was she crawling into it?

1353
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,033
Warren, don't just stand there.
The man insulted me.

1354
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,708
Hit him! Sock him! Knock him down!

1355
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,632
- Well, he is down.
- Well, then, kick him!

1356
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,034
Oh, well...
Let me help you.

1357
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,595
He's up now, Warren,
give him the old one-two.

1358
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,515
Oh, well, I would, but I have
to operate in the morning, my hands.

1359
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,795
Mr. Ryder, you'll have to excuse Katie
because she's not used to champagne.

1360
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,470
And you know who plied me with it?
Your precious Mr. Heminschlogger.

1361
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:00,473
And you know what else?
He called me a blackmailer.

1362
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,398
- Ablackmailer?
- Yes.

1363
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,117
Look, he's even stolen
my other shoe.

1364
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,312
Yeah, well, I think an explanation
is in order, old man.

1365
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,873
Oh, I agree with you, young man.

1366
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,593
Do you think I'm a blackmailer,
Warren?

1367
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,916
I never heard of anything
so ridiculous in my life.

1368
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,074
Oh, I can always depend on you.

1369
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,953
- Take me out ofhere.
- Oh, Katie...

1370
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,515
As for you, my fine-feathered
Heminschlogger,

1371
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,752
you're very lucky my fiancé didn't
beat you within an inch of yourlife.

1372
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,513
I know, I'm not lucky, but...

1373
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,879
Come, darling, let's go.

1374
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,469
Katie. Katie!

1375
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,990
Research. I mean, hello.

1376
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,633
Marge, you bettertake it.

1377
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,871
- Katie, please.
- Mr. Ryder.

1378
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,389
- Are you in for Mr. Dunning?
- Take the message.

1379
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,636
- Katie!
- Mr. Ryder, he says it's urgent.

1380
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,115
He hasto talk with you.

1381
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,752
Hello. Look, I'm very busy.

1382
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,552
We've got the loan.

1383
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,479
Yeah.
You know what held it up?

1384
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,116
The bank thought we hired Lasker
to watch you.

1385
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,072
I was beginning to think so myself.

1386
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,679
Katie, please!

1387
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,394
Katie, you've got to listen to me.

1388
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,113
- Pardon me.
- Katie.

1389
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,514
Please, you've got to listen to me.

1390
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,269
Nothing you can say interests me.
I'm going to marry the man I love.

1391
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,516
Not him, him.

1392
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,873
I can't let you make
that terrible mistake.

1393
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,559
- See this?
- It's a gun!

1394
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,797
No, not a gun, madam.
It's a tape recorder.

1395
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,832
Before you think ofmarrying
this young lady,

1396
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,359
I'd like you to hear something, doc.

1397
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,878
- You didn't!
- I didn't, huh?

1398
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,912
You may kiss me if you want to,
Mr. Ryder. It's perfectly all right.

1399
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,915
First time I ever kissed an anchorman.

1400
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,111
Oh, Mr. Ryder.

1401
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,757
Alittle further.

1402
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,433
And one more thing, Mr. Ryder.

1403
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,955
Once a blackmailer,
always a blackmailer!

1404
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,992
Blackmailer?

1405
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,033
Oh, come in, ladies, you're just
in time to hearthe next chapter.

1406
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:00,198
I can explain everything, Warren.
Really, I can. I can explain it all.

1407
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,551
I want money, real money!

1408
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,990
When I'm through with you,
you'll be selling your magazines...

1409
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,395
- Let me go!
- Very interesting, huh, doc?

1410
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,795
On a street corner!

1411
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,397
Well, that's about the size ofit.

1412
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,635
Sorry.

1413
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:19,559
This could never have happened
in Boston.

1414
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,833
Katie.

1415
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,630
I think I'll... I better get on home.

1416
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,274
It's a little late for bowling,

1417
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,432
and I've got a basset hound
tonsillectomy in the morning.

1418
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:38,034
Warren. You don't believe
all that silly nonsense, do you?

1419
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,710
Oh, no. No, of course not.

1420
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,352
Well...

1421
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,389
Well, what about tomorrow evening?

1422
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,636
Oh, well...

1423
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:53,877
Oh, I've got a meeting
at the dog medical center.

1424
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:58,392
But I'll... I'll keep in touch with you.
Okay?

1425
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,511
It was bound to happen.

1426
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,389
I knew it as soon
as I met his mother.

1427
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,433
There, there, Katie.

1428
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:29,070
I'm sorry, but I had to
show him up forwhat he was.

1429
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,794
We'll just have to find you
somebody else.

1430
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,355
I don't want somebody else.

1431
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:39,998
And you, embarrassing me like that
in front ofthose sweet old ladies.

1432
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,358
They thought I was some kind
of a criminal.

1433
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,357
I'll admit I shouldn't have done it.

1434
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,120
But even an idiot deserves
a second chance.

1435
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,834
I know you're not a blackmailer.

1436
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,439
I never believed you were.

1437
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,915
I couldn't fall in love
with a blackmailer.

1438
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,599
That's the important thing.

1439
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,031
Oh, no, the important thing...
Where are you taking me?

1440
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,196
- Up.
- But I don't wanna go up.

1441
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,712
I neverwanna see him again, and
I neverwanna see you again, either.

1442
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,595
But first I'm gonna tell you what
really happened that night in Florida.

1443
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,033
I was running away from
some drunken lunatic I had rescued

1444
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,949
from the swimming pool
and had helped up to his room.

1445
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:21,630
I came through some curtains,
and it was dark.

1446
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,274
And I knocked over some furniture.

1447
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,994
There I was,
in another man's bedroom.

1448
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,634
And there was a man in bed.

1449
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,310
Your uncle, Colonel Ryder.

1450
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,556
I thought he was asleep.

1451
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:40,276
Well, I was in and out ofthere
in about five seconds flat.

1452
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,359
And that must have been
where I lost my earring.

1453
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,676
I started down the hall,
looking for a stairway

1454
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,155
ora freight elevatoror something,

1455
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,750
when, suddenly, the house detective
yelled at me.

1456
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,599
- Hey!
- Oh, I kept right on running.

1457
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,549
I hadn't done anything, but racing
around a hotel with practically

1458
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,070
nothing on can give a girl
a terrible guilt complex.

1459
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:25,076
Like I told you, that's all in the past.
I never believed it for a minute.

1460
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,518
Stop that.

1461
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:30,029
I told you, we're through.

1462
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,238
- Of course, we're through.
- Well? So goodbye.

1463
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,793
Goodbye.

1464
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,116
I neverwanna see you again.

1465
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:41,034
But you'll have to, darling.
We'll be on our honeymoon.

1466
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,911
You mean you're...

1467
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,518
...asking me...

1468
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,475
Oh, Mr. Ryder.

1469
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,398
Oh, Mr. Ryder.
