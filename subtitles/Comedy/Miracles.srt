1
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:04,226
Previously on Miracles.

2
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:10,155
I hope you feel better soon.

3
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:15,097
Write it down exactly as you saw it.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,369
Six people in the past 25 years have witnessed this phenomenon.

5
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:22,388
My organization has interviewed them all.

6
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:28,152
But in every case, they have seen something significantly different.

7
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:31,199
Everyone's got parents. I just never knew mine.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,100
For God's sake, it's killing him!

9
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,093
He healed people, I saw it.

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,998
He died healing me.

11
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:39,756
Help us.

12
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,416
- It's real.
- The darkness?

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,155
It wants..

14
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:45,826
What does it want?

15
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,295
Everything.

16
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:50,175
Wait! Tommy!

17
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:01,462
Look, I think what we've been doing is wrong.

18
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:04,990
Maybe it's better if we just..

19
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:07,248
call it quits.

20
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:10,959
People are getting hurt.

21
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:14,670
I dont want to do this anymore!

22
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:19,898
Please, don't make me do this. There's gotta be another way.

23
00:01:22,628 --> 00:01:23,805
Okay.

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,103
Okay, you're right. You're right.

25
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:31,218
Just tell me when to go.

26
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:48,885
Who is it?

27
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,708
Mister Menagian- your landlord sent me out.

28
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:55,672
He's my uncle. I help him out sometimes after school.

29
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:56,526
What's the problem?

30
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,079
Uh, we're changing all the shower heads.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,528
Putting in low-flow no extra charge to you.

32
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,236
What about my dishwasher? It's been leaking for a month.

33
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:03,377
He just said shower heads.

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,852
I've called five times. You want to come in? Dishwasher's first.

35
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:13,452
So, I guess I better move it out.

36
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,229
Are you new at this?

37
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:16,472
Kind of.

38
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,527
I don't mean to ruin your day, it's just..

39
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:22,332
when I don't even get a call back, it sort of turns into a thing, you know?

40
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:23,419
What?

41
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:25,062
What?

42
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:28,089
Nothing.

43
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:36,033
I'm gonna need some help.

44
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:43,308
She was strangled with the tape measure.

45
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:53,240
- Detective Krantz.
- Yeah?

46
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,458
You better see this.

47
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:55,766
What have you got?

48
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,666
This is her journal.

49
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:04,669
So, who the hell is Paul Callan?

50
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:49,903
S01E06 Hand of God
Subs by Nixie & SubRaccoon

51
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:58,444
That's it. I'm done.

52
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,754
See you later.

53
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:02,322
Good game.

54
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:05,558
You work here?

55
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,434
More like a indentured servant.

56
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,204
Former resident too?

57
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,464
Father Calero says good things.

58
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:15,658
I didn't get your name.

59
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:18,158
Victor Krantz, Boston P.D.

60
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,107
Guess you already know mine.

61
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,207
Yes. Yes, I do.

62
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:26,344
Calero says that you're a guy that likes to help out.

63
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,455
You know a woman named Gretchen Albright?

64
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,984
No.

65
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,326
She's dead.

66
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,653
Sorry to hear that.

67
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:36,084
She was murdered in her kitchen around six o'clock last night.

68
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,389
Is there a reason you're telling me this?

69
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:39,448
Yep.

70
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,789
I suppose you want to know what I was doing around 6 o'clock last night.

71
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:47,169
Why not?

72
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:48,869
That's gonna be difficult.

73
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:50,369
I was hoping you wouldn't say that.

74
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:54,963
Where is easy, 1898 Keystone Street in Weymouth, an old victorian house.

75
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,710
Why is tricky.

76
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:58,147
Give it a shot.

77
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:03,706
I'm sitting alone in the dark, waiting for the walls to talk.

78
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,205
No kidding.

79
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,617
It's part of my job.

80
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:09,457
If you've got 3 or 4 hours, I could give you the short version.

81
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:13,583
People I work with, we investigate strange things.

82
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,775
I'm not liking what I'm hearing.

83
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:18,986
If it helps, I didn't kill anyone.

84
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:21,391
Maybe it does.

85
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:28,155
Oh, do the words "God is Nowhere" mean anything to you?

86
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:30,819
No.

87
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,179
Save some time tomorrow.

88
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,406
I'd like the long version.

89
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,153
Hi, kids.

90
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:58,618
Who is Gretchen Albright?

91
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,633
Don't you mean, who was Gretchen Albright?

92
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:03,687
Apparently, she was murdered last night.

93
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,368
The police have been here too?

94
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,118
Who do you think told them where you were?

95
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:08,637
A heads-up would have been nice.

96
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:09,732
Yes, and counter-productive.

97
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:11,040
The police can tell when you're expecting them.

98
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,265
It leads them down certain unfortunate mental paths.

99
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,330
Who was she, Keel?

100
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:20,099
Three years ago, Gretchen Albright was preparing a cake

101
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,420
for her youngest daughter's second birthday.

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,669
The glass mixing bowl that she was using

103
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:28,092
shattered in the sink, and she cut her hand.

104
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:30,267
Guests were arriving, so she wrapped a dishcloth

105
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,183
around the wound, and she went to greet the guests.

106
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,870
A few minutes later, she returned to the kitchen.

107
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:37,251
And it was then that she noticed the dishcloth.

108
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,527
And the words "God is Nowhere"

109
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,728
were scrawled in her own blood.

110
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:44,927
Detective Krantz asked me about that phrase.

111
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,607
What did you say?

112
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,996
I lied.

113
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,831
I'm not even sure why. I guess I was scared.

114
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:55,301
They probably saw the words in her personal effects,

115
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,425
journals, letters..

116
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:57,970
How did he connect the phrase to you?

117
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:01,321
They Googled "God is Nowhere", found an old article I'd written

118
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:04,912
in 1996 on hemography for "The Journal of Psychical Research"

119
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,917
Detective Krantz wanted to know what the phrase meant.

120
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:08,759
I said I thought it was rather self-explanatory.

121
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,049
If he talked to you, why would he need to talk to me?

122
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:13,547
He was being thorough, I suppose.

123
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:17,073
Why am I different?

124
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,401
What do you mean?

125
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,057
You interviewed six people like Gretchen.

126
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:24,393
They all saw "God is Nowhere" written in their own blood.

127
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,793
I saw "God is now here".

128
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,639
Why?

129
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,674
It's the kind of message that reveals the reader.

130
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:33,339
Isn't it?

131
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:39,157
Maybe. Maybe I read it wrong.

132
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,514
Where did Keel take off for?

133
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:56,352
He's out at Phycis lecture at Boston University

134
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,510
with some old friends.

135
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,448
He has friends?

136
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:03,394
Apparently there's some late breaking news

137
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,367
about the creation of the universe.

138
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,871
You didn't wanna go?

139
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,669
Well, sometimes I do, the lectures are fun,

140
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:12,394
but you know Alva, strip clubs till dawn.

141
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:13,761
You working late?

142
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:16,226
Yeah, I'm looking for the hemography files.

143
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:18,402
Alva keeps those in his office.

144
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:19,777
Really? Why?

145
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:22,229
I don't know.  I think he's been working on them.

146
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,487
Good night.

147
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,583
- Say hi to Matty.
- Thanks, I will.

148
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,227
So.. you broke in.

149
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,045
You lied to me!

150
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:05,321
If you wanted a key, you could've asked.

151
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,499
Every one of those six people who saw "God is Nowhere"

152
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,597
in their blood also saw me.

153
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:11,609
One of them even dreamed about my father.

154
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:12,770
Of course, you know all of this...

155
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:14,014
That glass is going to be difficult to..

156
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,764
Why didn't you tell me?!

157
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:20,898
It wasn't necessary.

158
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:34,008
I joined up with you to find answers..

159
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:38,620
answers you had right here in your files all along.

160
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:40,947
- And you found them.
- That's not all I found.

161
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,391
I spent a few hours tracking these people down, Keel.

162
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,099
Four of them are dead.

163
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:47,427
Dead?

164
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:51,217
Murdered, different ways, and all in the last week.

165
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:53,356
Gretchen Albright was the most recent.

166
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:56,997
You didn't know this.

167
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,762
No.. I did not.

168
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,908
Have you told the police any of this?

169
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:08,797
Not yet, but I will.

170
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:11,910
They haven't made the connection. I..

171
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:16,008
I figure it's better if they hear it from me first.

172
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:19,704
This could become very dangerous for you, Paul.

173
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,356
I think it already has.

174
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:39,538
Come in.

175
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:42,943
What the hell happened between you and Alva?

176
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:46,926
I show up, and there's broken glass everywhere.

177
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:50,187
He's not talking. What gives?

178
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:52,137
He's been lying to me since day one.

179
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,107
What are you talking about?

180
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,144
The "God is Nowhere" people, they've all dreamed about me in detail.

181
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:59,324
Real things. It's like they know my whole life,

182
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:02,160
even though we've never met and now they're being murdered.

183
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:03,153
Oh, my god.

184
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,621
I tried to track down the last two to warn them.

185
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:08,444
Danielle Franklin in Denver and some other guy.

186
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:11,755
His name was Kenneth Webster, but according to Keel's files,

187
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,905
he's changed his name and disappeared.

188
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:17,746
This doesn't make sense. Why would Alva keep all this from you?

189
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:18,908
I have no idea.

190
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:21,452
I just left a message for the police, told them everything I know,

191
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:24,844
but I think I may be the only one that can stop this.

192
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:26,521
So, where are you going?

193
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,807
Denver. He's already killed four people in five days.

194
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:33,182
Danielle Franklin's probably next, and she hasn't returned my calls.

195
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:38,663
Paul, this is crazy! You have no idea who is doing this or why.

196
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:40,946
For all you know, you could be on his list too.

197
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:42,778
Maybe I am.

198
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:45,371
You know, whether I like it or not, I'm linked to these people.

199
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:46,831
I feel like I need to be with them.

200
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,800
Why?

201
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,482
Because I know what it's like to be alone

202
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:51,172
in the middle of things.

203
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:55,552
Maybe I can answer some of Danielle's questions and..

204
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,142
maybe she can answer some of mine.

205
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,175
She knows my father.

206
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,095
Or she might.

207
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,417
In the transcripts I found in Keel's office,

208
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,665
she talks about three dreams she had.

209
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:14,350
The first is about me getting pneumonia when I was seven.

210
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,309
That happened. Back at St. Jerome's,

211
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:18,980
I spent two weeks in the hospital, almost died.

212
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,250
Second is about me getting in a car accident

213
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:25,299
and being healed by a boy.

214
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:28,270
She had that dream in 1983.

215
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,717
That's the third.

216
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:38,066
A man whose name is Paul Callan

217
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,587
is sitting at a table at a sidewalk cafe.

218
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:44,212
There's a fountain behind him. He's talking to a man.

219
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,773
That man is his father.

220
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:57,056
The man is saying something. Paul is angry. And then..

221
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:00,940
the water in the fountain turns red.

222
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,210
I've never even met my father.

223
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:05,646
I don't know a single thing about him.

224
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:07,960
Paul, if this woman knew anything more,

225
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,341
wouldn't it be in there, in those transcripts?

226
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:15,396
I don't know, Evie. She saw what I saw.

227
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:18,255
She's had dreams that have come true.

228
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,636
Can I tell Alva you're in Denver?

229
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,500
Don't tell anyone.

230
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:30,084
I don't like this, Paul.

231
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,729
I know.

232
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:17,995
Can I help you?

233
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:20,980
Yeah, um... I need a gun.

234
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:22,692
Okay, what are you looking for?

235
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:24,245
What's that?

236
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:27,128
That one? It's a Desert Eagle Jericho semi-auto.

237
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,362
That one next to it, that's a Glock 23, .40 caliber.

238
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:34,627
Wow. Okay, I guess that one.

239
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:36,096
The Jericho.

240
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,529
Need some ammo with that?

241
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:45,097
Yeah, I do.

242
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,134
How old are you?

243
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,413
19.

244
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,525
This is out-of-state.

245
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:01,036
Sorry, but according to federal law, I cannot sell you a handgun.

246
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,141
Would you like a rifle?

247
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:19,723
Have you seen Paul?

248
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:22,666
Paul says that you had information about him

249
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:25,316
that you deliberately withheld. Is that true?

250
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,134
- Yes, it is.
- Why?

251
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:29,398
Because Paul is on a spiritual journey,

252
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,009
this is something few of us undertake, and as in Paul's case,

253
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:35,500
it is not that one chooses, rather, one is chosen.

254
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:37,850
Well, that's very pretty. Why did you lie?

255
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:41,132
Evie, I'm sure you've read reports claiming that violent crime

256
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:42,684
on a worldwide basis is dropping.

257
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:43,399
Right.

258
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:46,781
But the actual level of random violence in the world is rising dramatically

259
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:49,735
child abduction by strangers, sniper attacks, suicide bombings.

260
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:53,020
Many, if not all of those people, claim to do their work

261
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,656
at the request of a higher being.

262
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:57,717
I was a cop! People kill people because they're drunk

263
00:17:57,773 --> 00:17:59,954
a lot more often than because God tells them..

264
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:02,560
That may be true, Evie.

265
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,728
But Paul's particular problem isn't booze.

266
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:09,093
If Paul is in any sort of danger because of all this,

267
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:11,829
you had no right to keep that information from him.

268
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:12,955
What would you have me tell him?

269
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:16,324
That he's capable of great good or great evil?

270
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:19,043
The worst thing that could possibly happen is for Paul

271
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:24,439
to somehow believe that his path is predestined for evil.

272
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:28,645
Once that idea's been planted, it's almost impossible to uproot.

273
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:31,724
So, let's plant the idea that he's predestined for good.

274
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:34,508
Oh, but even those who walk the path of light

275
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:36,558
often come to a bad end.

276
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:43,078
J.F.K., Martin Luther King, Joan of Arc even John Lennon.

277
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:53,151
What if Paul tried to.. get involved with these people now?

278
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:56,989
We don't know.. who this killer is.

279
00:18:57,122 --> 00:19:00,244
We don't know why he's striking now. We know nothing.

280
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,340
If there were anything to be gained from getting involved,

281
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:04,484
I'd be doing it.

282
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:10,010
But I've never seen anything like this before.

283
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:14,445
People are being murdered simply because

284
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:18,127
they all shared a paranormal experience.

285
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:23,439
Now is a time.. for keeping one's head down.

286
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,289
Paul Callan's not at his apartment.

287
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:33,370
Is there a problem?

288
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:35,753
Damn right, there's a problem. He left me a message.

289
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:38,113
Said there was gonna be another murder in Colorado.

290
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,347
I'd just like to find out why he's so sure.

291
00:19:41,451 --> 00:19:42,705
Where is he?

292
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:50,335
He's on Transnational Airlines Flight 629 for Denver.

293
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:05,060
Are you Paul Callan?

294
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:11,736
Yeah.

295
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:13,406
Will you please come with us?

296
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,150
I know, I know, it's just that this is all turning out

297
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:28,005
to be harder than I expected.

298
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,960
I got classes five days a week this semester, mom.

299
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:33,128
Weekends are wall-to-wall homework.

300
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:36,227
Gary's crazy.

301
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:39,650
He hasn't seen me because I'm in the library all day,

302
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:42,250
and he's in Vicki's room every night.

303
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,608
A couple, nothing serious.

304
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:48,548
I don't really have the time.

305
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:52,776
I'll try. Look, uh, ma, I gotta go.

306
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:56,144
I miss you, too.

307
00:20:58,575 --> 00:21:01,329
Well, tell dad I'll try to make it back for spring break.

308
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:05,723
Love you, too. Bye.

309
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:17,673
Why exactly are you convinced Danielle Franklin is in danger?

310
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:21,267
It's not gonna make any sense.

311
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,249
Yeah, it already doesn't.

312
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:29,982
Someone is murdering people who have all had a..

313
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,793
similar experience.

314
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,954
It's not a normal thing. It's a..

315
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:38,326
it's a thing called hemography, words..

316
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,576
written in blood.

317
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:41,980
Where? At the scene of the murders?

318
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:44,329
No, not a person writing words with blood

319
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:49,261
blood forming itself into words on its own.

320
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:54,959
The catholic church considers this a possible sign of a miracle.

321
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:58,953
And each of these people have seen this, uh, "Miracle"?

322
00:21:59,892 --> 00:22:01,350
So have I.

323
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,915
Well, I can tell you right now, Mr. Callan,

324
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,599
this is sounding even worse than you thought it would.

325
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,399
Hi, this is Danielle.

326
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:20,452

Hello, this is Detective Peter Bander

329
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:32,558
with the Denver police department,

330
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:33,890
calling for Danielle Franklin.

331
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,072
Please call me back at 555-0183 as soon as possible. Thank you.

332
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:44,077
Hi, I'm calling for Danielle Franklin. My name is Paul Callan.

333
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,802
The police should have already contacted you, but..

334
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,064
I really need to speak with you myself.

335
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:56,757
I'm flying into Denver today. My cell phone is 617-555-0152.

336
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:59,753
Please call me as soon as you get this message.

337
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:22,340
I never met her. That's the point.

338
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,929
She doesn't even know I really exist.

339
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,977
Then why did you fly halfway across the country

340
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:26,758
to come see her?

341
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,544
- To warn her that someone..
- Someone?

342
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:30,794
Someone may be trying to kill her. I've already told you this.

343
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:33,590
And while we're sitting here, it could be happening.

344
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:40,191
- Hello.
- Hello, Paul?

345
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,173
Yes, this is Paul Callan.

346
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:46,090
Oh, my god! It's me, Danielle.

347
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:48,197
I can't believe it's really you.

348
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:50,556
It's really me.

349
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:52,333
Are you in town?

350
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:54,229
Yeah, I'm at the downtown police station,

351
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:56,500
the one at Everly Parkway. Do you know where that is?

352
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:59,210
Uh, yeah. I can find it.

353
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:02,926
I can't believe I'm actually talking to you.

354
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,198
You even sound the same.

355
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,199
Same as what?

356
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:09,444
As you do in my dreams.

357
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,804
You're okay, aren't you?

358
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:14,113
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

359
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:16,794
Uh, no reason. It's just, um..

360
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,710
I, uh, I had another dream about you,

361
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:24,119
a bad one.

362
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,737
Get here as soon as you can, okay?

363
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:29,203
It's important that we talk.

364
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,285
Yeah, I think so too.

365
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,010
I'll be right there.

366
00:24:37,804 --> 00:24:39,227
Hi.

367
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:42,338
Danielle?

368
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:48,787
What do we got?

369
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:51,695
Danielle Franklin was killed by a single rifle shot to the head.

370
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,440
- Was it a sniper?
- Not exactly.

371
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:57,254
The distance was only 3 feet. So far, we have no witnesses.

372
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:13,240
She's dead.

373
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:20,489
If you hadn't stopped me, I could have..

374
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:23,070
- Could have what?
- Maybe I could have saved her!

375
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,336
- I'd like to leave now.
- Forget it.

376
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,550
I can't be a suspect. I've been here the whole time.

377
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,957
You seem to know a hell of a lot about a murder.

378
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:36,397
Before, it was just a theory. Now it's a fact.

379
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:38,061
For all we know, you're working with this guy.

380
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:40,034
Plan on being here awhile.

381
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:45,534
Who the hell are you?

382
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:49,201
Alva Keel. I have here a writ of habeas corpus for Paul Callan

383
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:51,405
petitioned by Ed Lorenson and signed by

384
00:25:51,412 --> 00:25:53,007
the Honorable Judge William Pound.

385
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:53,968
Come on.

386
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:56,477
A writ? The guy's been here less than three hours.

387
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,497
I hope they were productive.

388
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:21,969
I'd thank you for getting me out of there

389
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:23,639
if you weren't the reason I was there in the first place.

390
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:26,015
As the matter of fact it was Evelyn who informed the police

391
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:29,315
about your flight and I'm glad that she did. Look..

392
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:31,822
I'm sorry about Danielle Franklin.

393
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:35,735
Really? If you'd have been straight with me, she'd still be alive.

394
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:39,632
Hey, I'm glad you're still here. We just caught the guy.

395
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,047
Couple of uniforms picked him up a few minutes ago.

396
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,050
Had pocket full of Danielle Franklin's credit cards.

397
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:48,778
We've alerted Detective Krantz in Boston.

398
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:52,296
We think there might be a link to the Gretchen Albright murder too.

399
00:26:52,395 --> 00:26:53,708
I don't know how we're supposed to help.

400
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:56,203
I told you I've never seen the murderer before.

401
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:57,957
Just want to make sure.

402
00:26:58,569 --> 00:26:59,907
Would it be possible for one of us

403
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:01,780
to have a conversation with him?

404
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:03,409
Absolutely not.

405
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:05,589
I've never seen him before in my life.

406
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:08,964
All right, gentlemen.

407
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,820
Thanks for your time.

408
00:27:21,562 --> 00:27:23,681
Once he gets a lawyer, I'll petition for an interview.

409
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:24,939
- With me?
- Yes, of course.

410
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,284
Are you coming back to Boston?

411
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:27,565
I'm not sure.

412
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:28,598
Even if I do..

413
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:30,464
Are you having second thoughts about your new job?

414
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:32,667
I think maybe you and I are looking for different things.

415
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:33,941
I mean, I know why I'm doing this.

416
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:36,768
I want to know what happened to me, why I'm seeing things.

417
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:39,506
But you, I've got no idea why you even started S.Q.,

418
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:42,240
which makes the idea of teaming up with.. What?

419
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:43,378
What?

420
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,132
His current name is Hector Salgado.

421
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:46,423
Who? That guy they caught?

422
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:48,791
No, Kenneth Webster, the sixth man to see the words

423
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,917
"God is Nowhere", the only one still alive.

424
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:54,893
I assume you're planning to track him down.

425
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:57,316
Well, I'd advise against it. There's no point.

426
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,245
He never reported any special information of you.

427
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,925
Yeah, well, maybe that's changed. His file's pretty old.

428
00:28:04,587 --> 00:28:06,279
I owe you an apology.

429
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:07,872
I never should have kept that information from you.

430
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:09,303
Then why did you do it?

431
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,246
I just felt that it would be detrimental to you.

432
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,622
Maybe it will be. That's my problem.

433
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:20,256
This is the most recent information we have on Hector Salgado,

434
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:22,005
two possible addresses. It will save you the time

435
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:24,490
and me the cost of breaking back into my office.

436
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,373
Why are you doing this?

437
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:29,749
In my attempt not to influence events, I influenced them greatly.

438
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:32,507
Perhaps a better method would be simply to act on instinct.

439
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:34,757
I can't stop you from acting on instinct.

440
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:37,357
Santa Fe, New Mexico, or Estacada, Oregon.

441
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:41,959
It's about 30 miles southeast of Portland, a one-zip-code town.

442
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:42,653
Thank you.

443
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,154
Can I give you a lift to the airport?

444
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,717
No, I'll get a cab.

445
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:54,665
Paul, things do have meaning, and eventually, they do add up.

446
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:57,570
As a child, I never believed that. My family life was chaotic.

447
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:00,459
Like most people, I believed that life was nothing more than

448
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:04,146
a long series of unrelated accidents, leading inexorably to the grave.

449
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,065
- And now?
- Now I do not.

450
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,356
At Cambridge, I was pre-med.

451
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:10,653
I was gonna become a surgeon, just like my father.

452
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:13,675
I minored in linguistics. My senior project involved

453
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:17,627
decoding bird songs, painstakingly transcribing notes

454
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,062
and patterns in the utterances of the english field raven

455
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,923
and thereby describing the basics of their language.

456
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:24,248
I have no trouble believing that whatsoever.

457
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,650
I spent days wandering the moors, recording ravens

458
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:30,373
in their natural habitat, and then transcribing their sounds.

459
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:33,203
On the fifth day, the sounds were different.

460
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,434
As I listened to my tapes that evening, November 21, 1985,

461
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:38,705
among the bird calls, I heard other sounds,

462
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:41,968
sounds that I eventually recognized as voices.

463
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,852
Among them, the voice of my mother.

464
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:49,013
You're kidding.

465
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:53,052
She had a nickname for me.

466
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:57,805
"Mango," a character in a children's book, a bloodhound.

467
00:29:58,337 --> 00:30:01,160
Her reading to me from that book is one of the few fond

468
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,512
childhood memories I still possess.

469
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:07,257
She'd been dead for over a year when I heard her voice

470
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:09,031
speak my name on that tape.

471
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,057
No train.

472
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:21,011
And I didn't see God's name written in my own blood.

473
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:23,835
Doesn't take much to change the course of a life.

474
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,602
Sometimes a single word will do it.

475
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,766
And that's what led you to begin Sodalitas Quaerito.

476
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:33,737
It started me down a road, and that road led me here.

477
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:36,819
It led me to you.

478
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:43,411
It led me to you, Paul.

479
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:35,113
Hi. Mr. Webster?

480
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,459
My name's Paul Callan.

481
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:39,221
May I come in?

482
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:52,169
So.. you're Paul Callan.

483
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:53,706
That's right.

484
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,482
It's a nice place.

485
00:31:57,745 --> 00:31:58,977
You think?

486
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:04,943
So, you're the one they all dreamed about?

487
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:06,888
You didn't?

488
00:32:07,902 --> 00:32:10,604
No. I never did.

489
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,660
You need to leave.

490
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:16,098
You're a lot younger than I expected.

491
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:17,600
Am I interrupting something?

492
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:20,494
Yeah, he's gonna be here any second. You shouldn't be here,

493
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,111
unless you want to help.

494
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,495
I can help, whatever you need.

495
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:27,658
No, no, you have to leave.

496
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,320
If you're worried about the man who's been killing the others

497
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:30,871
you can relax.

498
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:33,301
The police arrested him in Denver a few hours ago.

499
00:32:33,316 --> 00:32:34,066
No, they didn't.

500
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:35,610
Trust me. I've been in close contact

501
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:37,801
with the police for the last few days.

502
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:40,802
Get out.. now.

503
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,778
What are you doing in my house?

504
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,793
No!

505
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:19,740
Oh, God.

506
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:30,850
Oh, God.

507
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:36,518
This is unit 11. We have two suspects in custody.

508
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:39,190
Ten-four. The ambulance is on its way.

509
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:54,234
I know who you are, Paul.

510
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,850
Who am I?

511
00:34:58,282 --> 00:35:00,316
Tommy comes to me, too.

512
00:35:02,863 --> 00:35:04,699
I almost finished it. I mean..

513
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:08,950
It's over for me. I know that.

514
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:13,950
I will never spend another free day as long as I live.

515
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:16,610
I've got to know it wasn't all for nothing.

516
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,806
I've got to know I did the right thing. I did.. didn't I, Paul?

517
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:24,914
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

518
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,608
You've got to know.

519
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:29,246
Because it's up to you now.

520
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:34,577
The voice told me about them all.

521
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,882
A voice told you to do all this?

522
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:38,921
God's voice.

523
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:42,104
I know it's him because he told me he's here.

524
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,571
I saw it written in my own blood.

525
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:51,057
Just like you, Paul, "God is Now Here."

526
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,739
We're the good ones, right?

527
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:56,427
Man, we have to be or..

528
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:59,726
Oh, man, wait till my mom finds out.

529
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,381
You saw the words too.

530
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:05,972
Yeah.

531
00:36:06,722 --> 00:36:08,299
Six months ago.

532
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:14,011
And then that kid, Tommy, he said he knew you.. or would.

533
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:18,392
And then a few weeks ago, God's voice came on inside my head.

534
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:22,782
He told me about the nine people who saw the words all wrong.

535
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:24,830
Every time I closed my eyes, he showed me

536
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,949
what they were going to do.. to everyone.

537
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,602
Now it's up to you, Paul.

538
00:36:33,517 --> 00:36:35,106
Nine people?

539
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:37,313
There's three more out there.

540
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:40,894
Tommy calls them "The Darkness."

541
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,672
And god made it so clear,

542
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:47,544
"kill them all.. before they can get their act together."

543
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,334
I never knew God talked like that.

544
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:54,820
You shouldn't have stopped me back there, Paul.

545
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:59,296
Because if Ken Webster isn't dead, then that leaves four for you.

546
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:08,177
I hate this. I hate this. Oh, god, I'm so scared.

547
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:27,561
No.

548
00:38:29,012 --> 00:38:30,807
Don't! Look out!

549
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:37,323
Now it's up to you, Paul.

550
00:38:37,424 --> 00:38:40,534
- No.
- Tell my mom I'm sorry.

551
00:38:51,773 --> 00:38:54,535
Apparently, two pounds makes all the difference.

552
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,475
The iron he used was graphite..

553
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:03,201
made in the last five years weighs two pounds, tops.

554
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,832
Go back to the irons our moms used..

555
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:08,136
real irons.. five pounds easy.

556
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:09,872
You'd be dead.

557
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:17,243
How's Mr. Webster?

558
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:19,491
He's in intensive care.

559
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:21,675
But we're hoping for a full recovery.

560
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:25,208
Either way, you saved his life.

561
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:27,434
We're done.

562
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:23,142
Let go.

563
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:40,591
Hey! Get off of him!

564
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:10,701
You took a few days off. That's healthy.

565
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:20,591
I understand that you were standing right there when it happened.

566
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,139
You saw it all.

567
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,265
Yeah, I did.

568
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,820
Before he killed himself..

569
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,516
Did the two of you talk?

570
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,076
A little.

571
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:38,353
What did he say?

572
00:41:41,952 --> 00:41:44,769
Nothing. He was out of his mind.

573
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:54,411
I take it that you've decided to stay on.

574
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,598
No, I haven't.

575
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,386
So, what have you got?

576
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:19,474
Apparently, there's a Roshi at the Zen Center in Providence,

577
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:24,287
Rhode Island, who's recently developed the ability to levitate.

578
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,566
Two of his students have witnessed this event, and, um,

579
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:32,301
they actually say that he's attained a height of 19 inches

580
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:37,995
and is able to sustain this height for over.. one hour.

581
00:42:40,216 --> 00:42:43,181
