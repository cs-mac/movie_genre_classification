1
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,867
(Car horns)

2
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,931
(Crash)

3
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:46,771
(Radio) '..in downtown Los Angeles
right now. Here with the traffic...'

4
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,491
I've been waiting for 15 minutes.

5
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,425
- Thought you were stuck in traffic?
- You late?

6
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,055
- You got all the paperwork?
- Yeah.

7
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,191
Are you pissed off at me?
I'm just doing my part.

8
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,361
- I know, I know.
- You're my guy, Jerry, my guy.

9
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,146
'Margolese Holdings,
how may I direct your call? '

10
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:30,182
- Yes, I'll put you through.
- Hey, Estelle.

11
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,548
Is that Nayman's little nephew?

12
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,350
- Yeah, that's Big Tom.
- Big Tom! Sure, it is?

13
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,823
- How's it goin' there, Big Tom?
- Hey, hey. Look.

14
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,728
Shh. See? See?

15
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,629
Why are you scaring the kid?

16
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,863
- I-I was just...
- Did you get that passport?

17
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,699
Yes.

18
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,032
- I have issues.
- Issues, Jerry.

19
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,546
It burns my ass to write you
a check every week.

20
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,808
I can explain what happened.

21
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,248
You say that
when it's once in a while.

22
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,117
- It's every time, Jerry.
- It's every fuckin' time.

23
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,716
And I can certainly
understand that perspective.

24
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,556
But I've been having
some personal problems...

25
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,324
uh, with my life.

26
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,459
My girlfriend, she's a great girl,
but she has complaints.

27
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,834
I don't but, she does.
If you want to know the truth,

28
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,636
I can't even believe this,
but we go to a group.

29
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,437
So...last week,

30
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,916
when you guys told me to pick up
the thing at the thing,

31
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,477
well, Samantha says she needs
the car to pick up some things.

32
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:47,492
And, I don't have to tell you boys,
I mean, things got heated, right?

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,154
And she hid them.

34
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,095
She hid them?

35
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,899
Oh! The keys. She hid them.

36
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,737
She... You know, and I couldn't
get to the thing on time,

37
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,779
and it all got messed up
and I think that maybe...

38
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,815
Maybe some things
aren't meant to happen.

39
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,011
Jerry, you're a fucking moron.

40
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,120
Here are your options. Number one,
I roll you up in a carpet,

41
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,786
stuff you in a Sedan
and set fire to you.

42
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,525
- You with me? Choice one.
- Yeah.

43
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,932
Number two. You like sex and travel?

44
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:33,563
What, you like to have sex?
You like to travel?

45
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,974
Get on a flight to Mexico. All the
hookers you can shake your stick at.

46
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,568
Pick up a pistol
that belongs to Margolese.

47
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,172
- What's it gonna be?
- OK, I was under the impression

48
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,619
with Margolese getting out of jail,
that the last job was my last job.

49
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,623
- You fucked up that job.
- You fucked it up.

50
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,658
This job will be your last job.

51
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,751
OK, but a trip right now...

52
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,628
He asked for you. Want me to call him
and say you can't go?

53
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,758
Because I'll call. I'd love to.

54
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,828
You're goin' on a fucking trip.
The town's called San Miguel.

55
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,534
You look for a kid in a bar,
the El Alamo.

56
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,673
This is a simple fucking task.
Write it down. Roll up your sleeves.

57
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,410
- Get involved!
- Ow!

58
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:23,012
The kid's name is Beck. He's got this
particular gun. He's waiting on you.

59
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,683
- Beck.
- When you find him, bring him

60
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,056
and the gun back Stateside, got it?

61
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,153
Last chance, Jerry.
I'm telling you. The last.

62
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,664
Even he's getting tired of your shit.

63
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,826
I'll take care of it, Bernie.

64
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,371
Vaya con Dios, motherfucker.
You're in coach.

65
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,546
Baby, what are you doing?

66
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,843
You said this was your last job!

67
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,885
What do you want me to say?
"Sorry I can't,

68
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,581
"the old lady wants me to quit.
Fuck off."

69
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,114
Yes! Something like that.
Like exactly!

70
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,252
I'm not in insurance, sweetie!

71
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:06,628
If you get on that plane, you will
never, never, ever see me again.

72
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,566
You got me?
We talked about this. I told you.

73
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,331
I wanted us to go
to Las Vegas for me.

74
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,771
- Not you, me.
- Baby, you're overreacting. OK?

75
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:20,176
Don't do that! Don't you do that!
Don't diminish my needs.

76
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,272
Sweetheart, I don't have a choice.
I gotta go.

77
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,978
- I go down there, I come right back.
- "I, I, I, I, I!"

78
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,318
I wonder what the group
would have to say about that.

79
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,554
No. You cannot use that against me!
We are not even married, but I go.

80
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,595
The group thinks we're married.

81
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,189
I accepted the potato slicer
for our anniversary.

82
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,166
Right, sweets? I go along.

83
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:46,671
That's it. That is it.
You... You... You go along!

84
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:51,199
You don't want to get married.
And this is the way you deal with it!

85
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,246
Huh? You're back to
the same old selfish,

86
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,441
self-involved, vile, disgusting...

87
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,212
- Oh, God. You are...
- ..self!

88
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:03,688
You're missing the grand design here!
If I don't go, I'm dead.

89
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,748
Yeah. And it's difficult
to have a relationship

90
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,386
if I'm stuffed with formaldehyde.

91
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:14,229
- Now, if anyone is being selfish...
- Oh! Now you blame-shift?

92
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,463
- You are blame shifting?
- Stop analyzing!

93
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,129
I'm calling a time-out!

94
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,130
Ah!

95
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,875
All right...

96
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,285
Jerry, I want you to acknowledge...

97
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,553
that my needs mean nothing to you
and you're selfish.

98
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,959
- Oh, my God!
- Jerry, acknowledge.

99
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,329
I... OK.

100
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,303
I will acknowledge that I promised
I would go to Vegas with you.

101
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,862
But now we're just slightly delayed.

102
00:07:54,941 --> 00:08:01,813
If you want to construe my wanting
to stay alive as being selfish, OK.

103
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:06,874
I have every intention of going with
you. Your needs are important to me.

104
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,549
Come on. Look at all my stuff here,
all over the pavement.

105
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,993
Come on, baby. Huh?

106
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,068
What do you say?

107
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,660
OK?

108
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,767
I'm going with or without you, Jerry.

109
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,573
What's it gonna be?

110
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,876
- A bastard!
- A bastard.

111
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,252
What happened to, uh,
"sweetheart" and "big love"?

112
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,224
All those things
you called me last night?

113
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,387
The only thing I'm interested
in calling you is a cab!

114
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,866
(Singing in Spanish)

115
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,216
(Automated telephone
instructions in Spanish)

116
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,989
Excuse me, speak English?
Excuse me, you speak English?

117
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,363
- (Speaking Spanish)
- What?

118
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,993
All set, Mr. Welbach.

119
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,836
If you go to the front,
a shuttle will take you to your car.

120
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,536
- What kind of car is it?
- It's a Chrysler. Brand-new.

121
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,579
Yeah.

122
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,705
Is there a problem, Mr. Welbach?

123
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,809
You know, it's my first trip
to Mexico and...a Chrysler?

124
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,286
I mean,
I drive a Chrysler in America.

125
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,985
I thought you might have something
more authentic, a little more...

126
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,722
- Mexican?
- You know, get into the spirit?

127
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,992
- Your first time?
- Yeah.

128
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,624
Wow. Exciting.

129
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,169
(In Spanish)
Do you speak Spanish, Mr. Welbach?

130
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,965
Huh?

131
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,265
(In Spanish) I didn't think so. Just
what you learned on Speedy Gonzales?

132
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,276
Yeah, Speedy Gonzales.

133
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,279
Let's see what we can do for you.

134
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,577
Oh, I think I have just the thing.

135
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,609
How would you like...an El Camino?!

136
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,678
Ooh! I like that. Yeah.

137
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,520
(In Spanish) You're going to get
into a lot of trouble here, sir.

138
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,582
Raoul!

139
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,198
(In Spanish)
Who wants him, a two-dayer?

140
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,131
He looks like a lead foot
and a brake rider.

141
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,465
No. At the count of three.

142
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,306
Uno... Dos... Tres...

143
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,325
(Engine revving)

144
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,364
Yeah, man. El Camino!

145
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:20,902
# El Camino excellente,
El Camino excellente... #

146
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,324
(Woman speaking Spanish)

147
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,516
# El Camino...

148
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,946
# In my El Camino... #

149
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,606
(Truck horn blares)

150
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,119
(Fuck me.)

151
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,983
Fucker.

152
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,260
(Chatter and fireworks popping)

153
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,213
You are in the wrong place, America.

154
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,979
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

155
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,289
What you want here?

156
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,190
Uh...tequila.

157
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,862
I asked because no one like you...

158
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,129
comes to this place.

159
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,296
It's death, this town.

160
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:12,243
Only farmers...and bandidos.

161
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,176
And I don't see a hoe.

162
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,352
You a bandido, America?

163
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,952
Uh, no. Uh, actually
I'm looking for a Señor Beck.

164
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,259
Señor Beck?

165
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,205
Right.

166
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,079
OK?

167
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,786
(Football commentary on TV)

168
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,498
- You Beck?
- (Men jeer)

169
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,733
- I know who you are.
- Good. That makes things easier.

170
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,766
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- (Beck speaking Spanish)

171
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,876
- We cool?
- You're all the same.

172
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,849
Prepared.

173
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,217
This ain't America. You want a drink?

174
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,585
- Yeah, all right.
- Sit down.

175
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,795
Somebody using this chair?

176
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,946
I guess you wanna see it, right?

177
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,482
- Yeah.
- You want to see it, don't you?

178
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,949
Yeah. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to.

179
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,283
Hey.

180
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,852
You know what? Come with me.

181
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,200
Sorry. Sorry.

182
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,002
This is what they call The Mexican.

183
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,341
Wow. Yeah, that's pretty.

184
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,717
Are you shitting me?
"Yeah, it's pretty."

185
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,881
- Can I?
- Uh-huh.

186
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:42,893
It was made for a rich landowner,
a nobleman,

187
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,452
by a poor Mexican gunsmith.

188
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,194
He fashioned this gun as a gift
to go along with the hopes

189
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:53,762
that the nobleman's son would take
his daughter's hand in marriage.

190
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,276
(Beck) 'The townspeople
waited three months

191

192

'Finally, the day had come.

193
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,017
'No one had ever laid eyes
on a more beautiful gun.

194

'It was all they thought it'd be.

195

'Some even thought
it was too beautiful to look at.

00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,037
'It was considered
to be an honor and good luck

(Church bell chiming)

203
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,635
Legend has it
that it's been cursed ever since.

204
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:39,109
But it hasn't harmed me any though,
you know? I... I love to look at it.

205
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:45,439
(Let me show you something.
Look, there's a bullet in there.)

206
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,385
(It's handmade. Hand-fucking-made.)

207
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,150
You don't even want to know
what this gun is worth.

208
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,661
We could sell that gun, man.

209
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,572
It's... It's a great fucking gun.

210
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,510
And I'm not just talking shit either.

211
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,313
You don't have to be a... Fuck.

212
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,115
I've been pissin' on myself. Fuck.

213
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,817
Anyway, the old man
is nothing to be afraid of.

214
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,157
As a matter of fact,
last week I told him to fuck off.

215
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,096
- Yeah, you did!
- That's what I said too!

216
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:37,727
I said, "Fuck off, Margolese,
you old prune shit-ass! If you..."

217
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,868
Come on, fella. Get up. Huh?

218
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,707
Man, you're soaked in your own urine.
Don't make me carry you.

219
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,648
Hey!

220
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,913
Ah, this is my life.

221
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,151
All right.

222
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,967
Yeah, baby. I got the touch.

223
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,763
- (Groans)
- Oh!

224
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,034
Buddy, you whacked your noggin!

225
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,767
Hey.

226
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,704
Oh, f...

227
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,848
Ooh.

228
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,717
Hey, man. Hey.

229
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,725
Oh, shit!

230
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,297
Oh, shit!

231
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,040
Stop that! Stop!

232
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,046
Christ!

233
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,310
I found the gun.

234
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,445
'The gun is in your possession?'

235
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,616
As we speak.
But, like I said, there's, uh...

236
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,784
There's a problem.

237
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,421
What? You lost the kid? He's a souse,
he'll be in another bar.

238
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:17,434
The kid's dead, Ted.
Ted, are you hearing me?

239
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,139
Yeah. I-I heard you.

240
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,868
How?

241
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,207
Bad luck, act of God, fuck if I know.

242
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,305
All these maniacs shooting
guns up into the sky.

243
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:34,546
It's Independence Day or something.
The kid got tagged by a loose one.

244
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,986
Right in the fuckin' head.
I mean... Fu...

245
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,388
He's dead! The kid's dead.

246
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,917
The little fucker's in my car
right now, dead.

247
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:48,022
Geez, Jerry,
that's not a little problem.

248
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,432
- 'That's a big problem.'
- I know.

249
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,198
Jerry, that little fucker
is Margolese's grandson.

250
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:57,036
What? What?

251
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,771
'Geez, you really
fucked it this time.'

252
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:03,872
What did I have to do with it? One
minute he's pissin', next he's dead.

253
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,541
'Don't even move.'

254
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,414
I'll phone the office now.

255
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,455
I'll get me on a plane
and straighten shit out.

256
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,787
Ted, you gotta get word to the old
man. I didn't know who he was.

257
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,694
- OK. Just sit tight, Jerry.
- (Crackling)

258
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:22,530
- Hello?
- Ted? Ted? Hello?

Hey! Wait!

Oh, no!

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,629

313
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,850
Um, um... Sir?

314
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,529
- Can you stop the car? Please.
- Why?

315
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,502
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Just open...

316
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:48,549
She told me, "Don't go. I don't want
you on that highway alone."

317
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,426
I said, "It'll be fine, Mom.
It'll be OK." But it's not, is it?

318
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,055
- I'm dead.
- Well, you're not dead.

319
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:59,502
You would have been dead
if I hadn't saved your life.

320
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,335
Would you rather
it was you back there?

321
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,637
I didn't think so.

322
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,372
Are you gonna kill me?

323
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,514
Depends on
too many variables to answer.

324
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,088
Are you gonna rape me?

325
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,523
That's not likely, no.

326
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,589
Well, what do you want?

327
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,523
I suspect the same thing
as the other guy.

328
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,903
The pistol.

329
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:38,466
The one that Jerry's havin' a hard
time coming back from Mexico with.

330
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,635
Jerry?

331
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:44,080
I work for Bernie Nayman,
who works for Arnold Margolese.

332
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,380
- You heard of these people.
- Yeah, I have.

333
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,285
- And your husband works for 'em.
- No.

334
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,255
Well, he does.

335
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:56,316
I know the selfish, no-good liar
works for them. He isn't my husband.

336
00:29:56,394 --> 00:30:01,229
Well, whatever he is to you,
Jerry is in the shit books.

337
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:06,362
When you're in as much shit as he is,
you get skittish about your future.

338
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,234
Clouds your judgement.

339
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,673
There's a lot of people
interested in that gun.

340
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,641
So what we got here is a...

341
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:18,774
"he who controls the girl,
controls the pistol" situation.

342
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:23,081
I'm a hostage? You blew that guy
to pieces for a fucking gun?

343
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,985
This is so Jerry. Look...

344
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,422
Sit down. Sit down.

345
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,461
Um...

346
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,496
Uh, uh...

347
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,193
Look.

348
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:39,066
Jerry and I broke up,
so if he's doing...

349
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,868
I don't know what he's doing.
It's got nothing to do with me.

350
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,512
You seem like a very nice girl.

351
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,605
Thank you.

352
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:55,016
But it's a fact,
in these life-threatening situations,

353
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,748
human beings...lie.

354
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,283
So you are gonna kill me.

355
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,296
All right, look.

356
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,425
If everything goes OK and Jerry comes
through without this getting funky,

357
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,526
I don't think that'll happen.

358
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,799
He gives me the pistol,
I give you to him.

359
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:20,508
I'm just here
to regulate funkiness. OK?

360
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,774
Go on.

361
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,881
Great.

362
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,191
(Donkey braying)

363
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,929
Hyah. Hyah!

364
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,433
Hyah!

365
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:51,107
Come on, buddy. Come on, OK?
Just you and me. Yeah.

366
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,802
Go!

367
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,779
Go. Oh! You're such an ass.

368
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,940
What are you...? No, no, no!

369
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,110
I'm sorry! I didn't mean...

370
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,618
Fuck!

371
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,383
Fuck!

372
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,691
(Horn)

373
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:12,888
Hey!

374
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,767
- ¿Que pasa?
- Buenas noches.

375
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:21,464
- Buenas noches.
- I need a lift to the next town.

376
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,372
(Speaking Spanish)

377
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:29,311
I need a ride
in your automobile to the next town.

378
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,975
I can't pay you.
I have no money. No dinero.

379
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,916
- De Niro?
- Sí. None.

380
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,180
Robert De Niro?

381
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,589
Robert De Niro!

382
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:45,152
Yeah. Uh, I need a lift
in your el truck-o

383
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,197
to the next town-o.

384
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:51,531
- Uh, village-o. Uh, uh, pueblo.
- Ah, pueblo.

385
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,070
- Yeah, sí!
- Al otro pueblo. OK.

386
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,129
- Yes?
- Señor De Niro!

387
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,639
Self-winding. You never have
to wind it. It's very fine.

388
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,653
Yeah. Shake like...
Perpetual calendar.

389
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,951
It's good.

390
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,721
Is this even gonna run?

391
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,694
Yeah?

392
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,136
Hey. That your ball?

393
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,896
Shit. Hey. Hey, man.

394
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,034
You got a rabid dog back here.

395
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,908
Go. Go!

396
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,413
Go. Out.

397
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:45,181
You gotta do something
about this dog.

398
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:57,992
(Operator) 'I have a collect call
for Samantha from Jerry Welbach.

399
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,266
- 'No one there, sir.'
- (Jerry) 'Give it a second.'

400
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:05,105
Sam, pick up the phone.
Sams? Samsonite?

401
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,041
Baby, please don't do this.

402
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,341
- 'Please try again, sir'
- No!

403
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,882
Just give it a second. She's there...

404
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,378
What are you doing?

405
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,006
- You're gonna make a call.
- To whom?

406
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,912
To Jerry.

407
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,612
You're gonna tell him that Leroy
is with you then you hang up.

408
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,588
- Leroy?
- Yeah. Leroy, that's right.

409
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,954
Then you're gonna hang up. Simple.

410
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,960
That's it?

411
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,086
It's enough. Believe me.

412
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,135
You gonna make the call
or do I have to make you? Cos I will.

413
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,766
- No. I'll call.
- Good.

414
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,808
Dial it.

415
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,110
OK. What's the number?

416
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,317
You have the number.

417
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,221
I don't know where he is.
You should have the number.

418
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,954
What are you tellin' me? You don't
have a number, a motel, nothing?

419
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,431
What's the matter, don't you listen?
We broke up. No longer together.

420
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,559
Why would I have the number?

421
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,115
I'm sensing you have trust issues.

422
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,177
You got one minute.

423
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,107
I'm a professional.
I do this for a living.

424
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,234
Goody for you.

425
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,477
You're wasting your time.

426
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,354
(Radio) # You're nobody
till somebody loves you... #

427
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,622
I think I believe you.

428
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:45,964
# You're nobody
till somebody cares...

429
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,035
What's in Vegas?

430
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:58,648
Uh, well...I'm gonna be a waitress,
then make a career as a croupier.

431
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:03,915
They can make $100,000 a year but you
have to have the hands, which I do.

432
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,957
I got them from Grandma Vega,
which is a good thing

433
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:10,391
cos my Granny Barzel
had hands like a circus midget.

434
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,725
How come you can't live with Jerry?

435
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,063
Do you know Jerry?

436
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:21,900
He has trouble expressing feelings.
He had a fucked-up childhood.

437
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:26,773
His mom is nuts. One of those people
who thinks the iron is always on.

438
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:31,247
- Don't you love him?
- I think that's the problem.

439
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,749
We love each other too much.

440
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,786
But he's... He's so selfish.

441
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,753
It's like we've been living
his life forever.

442
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:43,385
He'd tell you a different story,
but I give and he just keeps taking.

443
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:47,089
Our counselor totally
agrees with me, by the way.

444
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,258
I don't put much stock
in those counselor types.

445
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,337
All they do is sit around
and smoke joints.

446
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,396
Maybe, but Jerry is still a taker
and I'm a giver.

447
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,465
It's obvious.

448
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,306
A lot of people
are under the impression

449
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,710
that you get to choose who you love.

450
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,444
I'm sorry, are you...

451
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,748
Are you taking his side?
You're a man, of course.

452
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:15,588
- You're taking his side.
- You love him. You said so yourself.

453
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,128
It's all that matters.

454
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,760
You're a very sensitive person
for a killer.

455
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,829
Thank you, Sam.

456
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,962
Shit.

457
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,703
Get. Get out. Out.

458
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,264
Look, you gotta get out.

459
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,208
Get out!

460
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,025
(Muttering)

461
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,024
Go!

462
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,404
(Truck horn blaring)

463
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,540
(Speaking Spanish)

464
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,147
Hola, shithead! Where's my stuff?

465
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,248
Get back! Where's my stuff?

466
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:58,386
- Pistol. Pistolero. Get back.
- La pistola.

467
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,727
Get back!

468
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,994
Stay calm. Get back, get back!

469
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,803
Don't move.
What the f...? Give me those.

470
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,068
Back! Back, back.

471
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,509
Get in the car. Get in! OK.

472
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,047
Is that my...? Is that my jacket?

473
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:23,485
Put it in the car! What is wrong
with you people? Get back!

474
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:50,847
- (Sam) You don't have to be in here.
- I go by track record.

475
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:55,511
- I don't hear any tinkle, tinkle.
- Stage fright.

476
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,384
Look around,
there's not even a window.

477
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:04,321
So what's with this "We've been
livin' his life forever" thing?

478
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,363
I didn't mean it literally.

479
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,423
Jerry's been working for Margolese
for five years less a day.

480
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,526
It just feels lifelong.

481
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,037
- Sounds like jail terms.
- It is.

482
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:19,132
Arnold Margolese is in jail
because Jerry put him there.

483
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,971
Jerry ratted out Arnold Margolese?

484
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:29,611
No. Jerry was coming across Ventura,
over there by Laurel Canyon.

485
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,281
- Yeah?
- He wasn't paying attention,

486
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,883
ran a red light,
smashed into Margolese's Cadillac.

487
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,125
The cops came, Margolese got busted
cos he had a person in the trunk.

488
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,928
That's how Margolese
got sent to jail?!

489
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,434
Mm-hmm.

490
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,430
- Live person or dead person?
- Live person.

491
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,204
Huh. What's the big deal, then?

492
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,006
He probably wasn't
gonna stay that way.

493
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,243
He was taped up in a trunk
for a reason, wasn't he?

494
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,808
I would think this was
right up your alley, Swifty.

495
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,189
- He saw something?
- Whatever it was this guy saw,

496
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,228
or was going to say to the cops,
he got the chance.

497
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,959
Since it was Jerry's fault, Margolese
had him work off the jail time.

498
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,035
My whole relationship
has been hijacked

499
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,561
because he doesn't pay attention
when he drives.

500
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,166
I... I can't go with you in here.

501
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,521
(Urinating)

502
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,618
(Sam urinating)

503
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,890
(Man) We didn't think we were getting
a dead man with the car.

504
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,698
I got no use for a dead gringo.
Take a left.

505
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,117
(Flies buzzing)

506
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,262
Come on.

507
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:27,369
If you're going to kill me,
at least tell me

508
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,065
who it is that's going
to send me to God.

509
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,640
Tell me!

510
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,343
Look, I'm not gonna kill you.

511
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,044
But I am gonna have to shoot you.

512
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,721
But why, sir? Why?

513
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,847
Why? Because you stole from me,

514
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,018
you know about the pistol
and you'll steal again.

515
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,257
I can't have you coming back
like a fly in the ointment.

516
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,992
I won't be a fly!
You'll never see me again.

517
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,863
You're gettin' shot, that's it.

518
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:01,268
It'll take time to walk to town,
especially limping...

519
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,999
Wait, wait. Limping?

520
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:07,032
Can't you just tie me up some more?
Fuck! You shoot me? Tie me!

521
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,511
Yeah. I don't have a rope.

522
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,275
So you shoot me?

523
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,340
It's the American way.

524
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,546
Where do you want it?

525
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,751
OK.

526
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,229
Not the leg! There's arteries.
I could bleed to death in seconds.

527
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,594
The foot.

528
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,159
That's fair where I come from. OK?
It'll hurt, but it'll heal.

529
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,706
What if you take off a fucking toe!

530
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,106
Wait, wait, wait. Not the left.

531
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,440
Oh, sorry.

532
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,912
On the count of three.

533
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,007
- One...
- (Screams)

534
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:51,612
Look, I'm agreeing with you.
But there's a few ways to look at it.

535
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,021
Sex is, no matter what anybody says,

536
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,922
a very important part
of any relationship.

537
00:44:56,994 --> 00:45:00,657
The fact that Jerry
is a considerate lover says a lot.

538
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,201
- You lost me.
- Well, he's a considerate lover.

539
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:10,866
You gotta find a way to get him to
expand this quality he has during sex

540
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,432
to other areas of your relationship.

541
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,036
Even if it only comes out in sex,
it's there just the same.

542
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,641
That's a good point.

543
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:26,315
If a person's a considerate lover,
he can't be all selfish, right?

544
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,957
Unless of course he's...

545
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:40,629
- He's, uh, being a considerate...
- What was that?

546
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,934
What?

547
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,301
That. That moment you had.

548
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,946
What moment?

549
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:55,608
Leroy, you just checked out
that guy and had a moment.

550
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:58,120
That was a moment.

551
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,585
I don't know if it was a moment.

552
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,555
(Are you gay?)

553
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,129
- As in happy?
- As in homosexual.

554
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:18,834
What does my sexual orientation
have to do with our conversation?

555
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,570
Nothing.

556
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:25,114
Nothing. Except something that you
said back there really bugged me

557
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,049
and this would kind of
help it make sense.

558
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,746
Yeah? What's that?

559
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:34,257
I asked if you were gonna rape me,
you said, "Not likely."

560
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,918
You said it so coldly,
like I was repulsive

561
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:41,488
and it was ludicrous to think I was
actually at risk of being raped.

562
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:47,160
First of all, it's a crime of anger,
not attraction.

563
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:51,833
Second of all, you're not repulsive.
You're very beautiful.

564
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,809
Thank you.

565
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,402
- You want me to rape you?
- Are you gay?

566
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,176
- You want me to rape you?
- You're gay.

567
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,510
You're gay. I knew it!

568
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,554
Oh, I so knew it.
I just knew it. What a relief.

569
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:10,321
Do you want a medal? A little trinket
saying you identified a homosexual?

570
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,828
No.

571
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,796
Are you full throttle?

572
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,495
Full throttle?

573
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,113
Yeah, I guess I am.

574
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,547
Oh. I'm not... I mean...

575
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,246
I'm not trying to be a smart-ass
or anything like that.

576
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,687
I just... I think this is great.

577
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,690
Wow. This is...

578
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:45,125
This is...major, OK?

579
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:49,529
I...know the kind of people
in your business, OK?

580
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,900
- Yeah?
- And to me, it seems that...

581
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:59,932
Well, being gay isn't really...
conducive to the environment.

582
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:05,276
Like I should be an interior
decorator. That's insulting.

583
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:09,250
- I am very good at what I do.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

584
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,619
No, I don't.

585
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:18,689
Unfortunately,
I seem to be unable to keep...

586
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,662
relationships together.

587
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:27,697
Seems like everybody's having trouble
keeping relationships together.

588
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,140
It's ringing, señor.

589
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:10,873
- Thank you for that.
- No, no, no. No necesario.

590
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,882
Really?

591
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,513
That's so kind.
You have no idea what...

592
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,782
'Hi, this is Ted. Leave a message.

593
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,324
'If this is my guy in need,
I'm on my way.

594
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:26,385
'Go to the Hotel de la Plaza.
Wait for me there, OK? Sit tight.'

595
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,431
OK, OK. Forget aeropuerto.

596
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,694
Uh, Hotel de la Plaza.

597
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:39,133
- (Muttering in Spanish)
- Hola.

598
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,541
- Is this your dog?
- Sort of.

599
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,079
Came along for the ride.

600
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,207
He has a personality
and that does count.

601
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,914
- He's a good guy.
- Is this your car?

602
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,617
It's a rental. I'm an American.

603
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,057
- No shit? Really?
- Yeah.

604
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,828
I'm Mexican.

605
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,866
Cool.

606
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,526
Do you have a passport?

607
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:18,375
- Jerry Wellbatch, Los Angeles, USA.
- Welbach... Wellbatch.

608
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,350
Can I ask you a question, Jerry?

609
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,151
How long have you been in Mexico?

610
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:32,022
- A few days. Pleasure.
- I see.

611
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,654
- Pleasure, huh?
- Yeah.

612
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:39,759
I see. Can you tell me,
uh, what happened here?

613
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,604
That's not accurate, I'm afraid.

614
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,975
The gunsmith did craft this pistol
for a prospective husband,

615
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,674
and he was a nobleman's son, true.

616
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:56,913
But the motif was darker, my friend.

617
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,353
It's cursed, this gun.

618
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:08,020
(Policeman) 'The key to this tale
involves the gunsmith's assistant,

619
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:13,034
'a poor, but honorable
young man in blinding love

620
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,934
'with the gunsmith's daughter.

621
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:19,999
'For months at a time,
the assistant took to the mines

622
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,305

623
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:27,145

00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:31,654
'only to discover that what he hoped
could be a wedding gift for him...

625
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,819
'was for another.

626
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,861
'The gunsmith insisted his daughter
marry the nobleman's son,

627
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:41,328
'forbidding their love.

628
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,934
'Angered in his bitter pain,
the assistant cursed the gun,

629
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,871
'vowing the creation
would never prevail.

630
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,112
'But the gunsmith
was racing against time.

631
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:02,811
'He had promised a pistol
of unparalleled craftsmanship,

632
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,684
'the nobleman's dowry
hanging in the balance.

633
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:14,128
'He worked day and night
to correct the pistol's problems.'

634
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,595
(Bullet ricocheting)

635
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,715
(Church bell chiming)

636
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,818
This gun never worked properly.

637
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:45,191
Some say its very creation
ended the gunsmith's life.

638
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:59,402
Well, my friend, you're free to go,
but without the gun.

639
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,570
This gun doesn't belong
to you or to your boss.

640
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,671
Now it belongs to me.

641
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:10,179
(Man) Yeah, Vegas.
It can be tough that way.

642
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,151
(Sam) Expensive?
(Man) Yeah, emotionally.

643
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,692
I had a serious relationship problem.

644
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,321
Well, you fit right in here.

645
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:26,661
- What do you do now, Frank?
- Now...I am a postman.

646
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,227
Get out of here.

647
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,570
- That's so rigid.
- Swear to God.

648
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:34,405
There's a seedy underbelly
to the postal service.

649
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:37,173
- Is that the key to it?
- That's the key.

650
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,612
You have no idea how many small,

651
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,914
unmarked brown paper packages
I deliver.

652
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,887
- What, porno?
- Yeah, daily.

653
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,548
Like what?

654
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:52,323
Videos, blow-up dolls,
dildos, pocket pussies.

655
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,522
- Don't leave nothing out.
- Oh, yeah?

656
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,659
But even with all that
dirty excitement at my fingertips,

657
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,296
I still have to take off
once a year.

658
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:07,173
I just get up and I know I'm going
to Vegas, I just don't know how.

659
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,213
All I've got is my wallet
and an attitude.

660
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,642
I don't know, it keeps me sane.

661
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:18,381
After all, guns don't kill people...

662
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,650
postal workers do.

663
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,075
OK, you're all set, Mr. Shurker.

664
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,210
If you go to the front,
a shuttle will pick you up.

665
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,448
What kind of car is it exactly?

666
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,514
It's a Chrysler, sir, brand-new.

667
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,823
You wouldn't happen to have
something a little more...

668
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,226
Raoul!

669
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,774
Yeah, man!

670
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,277
Yeah. Never fear, Teddy's here.

671
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,712
How are you?

672
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,557
- 'Rosco!'
- (Speaks Spanish)

673
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:38,260
Come on, Jerry.
The Mexican thief, the dirty cop?

674
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,065
The word is out.
It's a big-ticket item.

675
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,663
A lot of fucking people
are interested in that gun.

676
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,968
No fucking...
Is that what they think?

677
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,014
That I'm selling them out?

678
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:55,950
Maybe they think you're scared
and might do the wrong thing.

679
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,146
- Ted.
- You know, I don't know.

680
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:02,520
- I'm just doing my portion here.
- Yeah, and what is that?

681
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:07,291
To find out what's going on, assess
the damage, try to calm you down,

682
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,697
help find the pistol, get us home.

683
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,362
I get on that plane, pistol or not.
it'll be the last flight I ever take.

684
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,703
- Oh, come on, Jerry.
- "Come on"? You know it.

685
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,869
- I know what I have to know.
- Doing your part.

686
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,776
I know what I have to know.

687
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,680
You sound like Schultz
from Hogan's Heroes.

688
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,945
(German accent) I know nothing!

689
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,953
I don't like Nayman
running things either.

690
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:36,048
I got a few years on you and I'm
telling you, keep your nose clean,

691
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:39,152
look straight ahead
and do what you're told.

692
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,563
That's why I nearly paid off
Boca Raton. I do my fuckin' portions.

693
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,663
I don't care how you look at it,

694
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,138
the first step out of this
is to get the pistol back.

695
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,335
I never took a pay-off in my life.

696
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:58,074
Jerry, look,
I know where your loyalties lie.

697
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:01,948
But the kid's dead.
The pistol's gone.

698
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,987
I mean, you can see
how it looks, right?

699
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,453
Come on.

700
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,055
You're my guy.

701
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,064
(Phone)

702
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,631
(Ringing continues)

703
00:57:56,739 --> 00:58:00,800
# We can dance if we want to
we've got all your life and mine

704
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,435
# As long as we abuse it,
never gonna lose it

705
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,708
# Everything will work out right

706
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,807
# I say, we can dance if we want to

707
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,546
# We can leave your friends behind

708
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,056
# Cos your friends don't dance
and if they don't dance, well they're

709
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,818
# No friends of mine

710
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:19,417
# I say, we can dance, we can dance,
everything's out of control

711
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,624
# We can dance, we can dance

712
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,963
# They're doing it from pole to pole

713
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,834
# We can dance, we can dance,
everybody look at your hands... #

714
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,738
- (Music stops)
- Not the safest dance!

715
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:53,061
I'm not going anywhere.

716
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,826
(Sam) We are in the city
where I'm going to be living.

717
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,436
(Go.)

718
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,309
Go.

719
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,044
What's wrong? Huh?

720
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:25,593
You know when you're in
a bad relationship and you separate?

721
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:30,689
All of a sudden, everywhere you look
there's love and possibility.

722
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:37,072
I'm worried about Jerry.

723
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,606
All right, don't worry.

724
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,577
I'll call Nayman
and check in on everything.

725
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,745
You want me to stay?

726
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,218
I want you to go.

727
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,888
You sure?

728
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,622
I really want you to go.

729
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,532
(Clicking)

730
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,786
(Snoring)

731
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,402
(Ted) I couldn't sleep all night.

732
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:49,173
Yeah. No, he said he followed
the cop to the pawn shop.

733
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,180
He's taking me over there
after breakfast.

734
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:56,241
We're booked on the seven o'clock
if all goes well.

735
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,449
No, now wait... No...
No, you wait a minute, Nayman.

736
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:04,084
Now what do you gotta go
and say that for?

737
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,287
Well, now or later?

738
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:09,229
How could I misinterpret?

739
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:13,257
No, you didn't send the wrong guy.
I'm handling things.

740
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,531
But I never signed up for that.

741
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:19,974
Listen, I promise you, when I tell
him, it'll make a difference.

742
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,036
Bye.

743
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:27,472
(Toilet flushing)

744
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:37,860
Hey, sweets. I keep calling
and I haven't heard a word from you.

745
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,918
I'm starting to wonder.

746
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:43,056
I know you're angry with me,
but, uh...

747
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,994
You know,
"Ain't no sunshine when she's gone".

748
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,539
OK?

749
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,811
I think she actually went to Vegas.

750
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,680
I keep telling you,
these women are problems, you know?

751
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:05,015
You should try to be like me -
I answer to myself.

752
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:09,922
No hassles, nobody ridin' my ass like
a goddamn horse in a saddle. Free.

753
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:15,225
You close yourself off so you have
no shot at meeting the right woman.

754
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,858
Any woman can be the right woman
if the numbers work.

755
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,563
No way. Not me.

756
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:26,199
You settle. You open yourself up.
You become vulnerable.

757
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,903
What's the insight
into my relationship?

758
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:35,674
OK, look, Jerry. She is in Vegas.

759
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,548
What?

760
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,985
Hey, shit falls down, you know?

761
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:41,887
Shit falls down?

762
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:46,088
Margolese called Nayman all pissed
off cos you were fucking this up,

763
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,686
told him to keep an eye on Sam
in case...

764
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:53,532
In case I get any funny ideas.
You're just telling me this now?

765
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,936
- There's other things to consider.
- Like what?

766
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,100
That gun's worth a lot. People know
you have it. Sam could be in danger.

767
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,269
No shit. Who did they put on her?

768
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,814
You don't know him,
but you know of him.

769
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,316
- Who?
- That fucking psycho Leroy.

770
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:11,080
- Leroy!
- Nayman had to. It was an order.

771
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:13,588
Margolese would know if he didn't.

772
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,715
Wait.

773
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,293
They're just trying to scare me.

774
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,296
Well, that would sure do it for me.

775
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,162
We've all heard
the kidney story, Jerry.

776
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:29,193
Nayman wants us on that seven o'clock
flight, pistol in tow. No buts.

777
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:33,766
They'll meet us at the airport
and then Leroy will take the pistol.

778
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:36,569
Yeah.

779
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,174
I had to borrow...

780
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,304
Do you mind?

781
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,983
Sleep well?!

782
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,615
Yeah. You?

783
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,017
Who's Winston?

784
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,831
Somebody I don't like very much.

785
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,961
You can have that removed, you know?

786
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,097
Yeah, maybe I will someday.

787
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,682
You wanna get some breakfast?

788
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,560
(# War: "Why Can't We Be Friends?")

789
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,573
(Knocking)

790
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,750
(Knocking)

791
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:56,240
# I've seen you round
for a long, long time

792
01:06:56,312 --> 01:07:00,112
# I really remember you
when you drank my wine

793
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:04,983
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

794
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:11,688
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

795
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:16,789
# I seen you walking
down in Chinatown

796
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:20,767
# I called you
but you could not look around

797
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:25,637
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

798
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:31,340
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? #

799
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,905
At first,
I thought this guy is all right.

800
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:39,011
And then I'm thinking he's more than
all right, he's terrific.

801
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,956
But there's no way he's gonna
feel the same way about me.

802
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,320
Then I find out he does.

803
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:52,457
Then I'm thinking...

804
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:56,197
what happens when
he finds out what I do...

805
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,773
and who I am and what I've done?

806
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:03,643
You know, who am I kidding, right?
Let's get serious.

807
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,771
What are you gonna do about it?

808
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,476
That's it.
I didn't have to do anything.

809
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:12,487
It happened absent of my will
to consciously make it happen.

810
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,488
Oh, really?

811
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,150
I was a little drunk last night.

812
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:21,628
I took my gun and I put it in
the towels in the bathroom, you know?

813
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,298
And he found it.

814
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,674
And he said,
"The past doesn't matter.

815
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,606
"It's the future that counts."

816
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,546
Leroy.

817
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,983
See, life can change.

818
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,045
People can change.

819
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,823
I haven't cried in 12 years.

820
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,829
What are you lookin' at?

821
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:06,432
Don't look at me like that.
You're makin' it worse.

822
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,875
What are you, Barbara Walters?

823
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,640
It's just beautiful.

824
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:14,512
Let's talk about somethin' else.

825
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:19,543
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Anything. Anything else. Whatever.

826
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,357
What was it over,
the last time you cried?

827
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,690
Let's talk about that.

828
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:29,595
Oh, yeah,
that'll bring the sun right out(!)

829
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,295
(Ted) I heard
it was this guy Leroy's mother.

830
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,633
OK, that's what we call bullshit.

831
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,138
If I told one guy
at the next convention

832
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:41,267
that you kept your mother
cut up in the freezer,

833
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:43,277
you'd have a reputation too.

834
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,779
Fact or not, it makes no difference.

835
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,408
Jesus, Ted, you can't be so naïïve.

836
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,712
- The guy's a star.
- Oh, my God.

837
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,255
Why are you so worried
then if you think it's bullshit?

838
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,484
I met Leroy once.
It was for all of two seconds.

839
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,154
I shook his hand.
He seemed like a nice guy.

840
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:03,756
Whether or not he lives up
to his legend isn't the point.

841
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:07,768
Or if he sits in his garage
soaked in gasoline lighting matches,

842
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,269
I don't care.

843
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,898
What concerns me
is he was hired in the first place.

844
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:17,105
- Are you with me?
- Geez, Jerry, you really met him?

845
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:19,147
Oh, my God!

846
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,616
Ted is not gonna let anything happen,
OK? I'm here.

847
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,811
Thanks, Ted. I feel real safe.

848
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,120
- Hola.
- I no fuck around, comprende?

849
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,492
Gun, gun, loaded.
Bang, bang. You, dead.

850
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:37,589
Do you have a speech impediment?

851
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,803
- Give me the gun. The pistol.
- The pistol?

852
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,065
You know what I'm talkin' about.

853
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:47,131
- The pistol?
- OK, what's your name?

854
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,108
Joe.

855
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:52,840
Joe, do what he says and we'll
be out of here before you know it.

856
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,007
- The pistol, please.
- OK.

857
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,711
Thank you.

858
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,714
Excuse me.

859
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:11,527
Come on. Go.

860
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:17,601
Got it.

861
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,073
Just have a seat right here, amigo.

862
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,486
Jerry! Have you lost your mind?

863
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,754
What were you talking about
on the phone?

864
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,625
Put the gun away.

865
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:45,064
Was it to off me?
Is that what you two were discussing?

866
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,194
- Jerry, I would never...
- Go ahead, deny it! Go ahead.

867
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,965
- Go ahead!
- OK, OK.

868
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:52,633
Jerry, that's what he said.

869
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:59,069
So you were lying when you said
I'd walk away from this?

870
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:03,414
- No, Jerry, that's what he said.
- Then you're lying to me now.

871
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,080
No, no. Nayman told me to do it,
Jerry, but...

872
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:09,690
- But?
- But...

873
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:13,751
But you're just doing your portion.
Isn't that how it works?

874
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:17,024
17 portions left for Boca...
Boca Raton, right?

875
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,533
I wouldn't do that. Come on, I swear!

876
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:23,628
They tell you to bring me in,
then they tell you to take me out.

877
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:27,005
Why are you being told
two contradicting things?

878
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:31,843
- You don't ask a question?
- I-I just... I... I don't know.

879
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:36,317
- You don't think it's weird?
- Yeah, it's... It's weird.

880
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:39,912
Right! Because something's going on.
What is it?

881
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:50,591
Exactly. You don't know,
you're just doing your fucking part.

882
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,760
Well, I'm not going down
because you don't know!

883
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,895
You see my predicament?

884
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,145
You're my guy, Ted.

885
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,408
(Handcuffs locking)

886
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,313
You're my guy, Jerry.

887
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,282
Wait. What happened here?

888
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,753
Someone killed themselves.
Swan-dived off the balcony.

889
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,347
Let's go.

890
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,390
Stay back. Nothin' to see here.

891
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,198
Walk on.

892
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,201
Thank you very much.
Sorry to have disturbed you.

893
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,070
(Man) Hotel security.

894
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,987
No.

895
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:29,030
Please, no.

896
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,860
(Knocking)

897
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,538
No. No.

898
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:46,577
(Leroy) Coming.

899
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,974
Sir, there's been
a terrible incident.

900
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:52,986
Are all parties
in your room accounted for?

901
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,718
Yeah. Yeah.
Just me and my wife. Honey!

902
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:59,022
No, that's OK, sir. Thank you.

903
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,460
- What happened?
- Sorry to disturb you.

904
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:05,056
Everything all right?

905
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:10,203
Leroy...

906
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,733
Pack your shit.

907
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,891
Shh, shh.

908
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,209
(Leroy) Psst.

909
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:10,747
You're a stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

910
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:14,351
You're well dressed,
I'll give you that, but stupid.

911
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:18,356
Wear Kevlar? Huh?

912
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,231
Yeah.

913
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:24,666
Leroy.

914
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,736
Please don't do this. Please.

915
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,008
You think I should
listen to her? Huh?

916
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,215
What do you think?

917
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,351
Huh?

918
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,289
Wanna know what I think?

919
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:47,521
Kevlar is for pussies.

920
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:52,896
This is for Frank.

921
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:06,177
(Woman speaking Spanish on PA)

922
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:25,190
- My bag will make the flight?
- They'll run it down.

923
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:28,395
- I just need to see your passport.
- Yeah.

924
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:36,110
- I'm afraid there's been a mistake.
- What?

925
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,544
No! No!

926
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:41,878
Mr. Shurker most probably has yours.

927
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:04,131
(Leroy) I told you, if Jerry makes it
and nothing gets funky, it'll be OK.

928
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,834
- Well, shit got funky.
- Why isn't he here? Why? Why?

929
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:11,208
Give me a second,
I'm trying to get the story here.

930
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,716
Take it easy and stop acting like a
kidnapped chick on a carton of milk.

931
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:24,683
Hmm. Yeah, you're right.
This is an offer for the gun.

932
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,785
Yeah. I can see how this looks.

933
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:30,992
I've just been trying to get
some better numbers together.

934
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:34,661
You have no intention
of giving the gun to Margolese.

935
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:39,307
Look, Bobby.
You know, I know that you're loyal.

936
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:43,276
That's good.
I mean, nobody's debating that.

937
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,836
Let me ask you,
in your skulking around,

938
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:49,348
going through private things
in people's offices,

939
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:52,181
did you discover
that he's shutting us down?

940
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:55,621
That's right. You, me, everybody.

941
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,920
I don't... I don't understand.

942
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:01,053
What, you didn't get the memo,
the bonus? No?

943
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:04,290
No. Nothing.

944
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:09,531
Me neither. Difference is I know
when I'm being fucked and you don't,

945
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:13,096
cos you're standing
on the wrong fucking line.

946
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,936
Let me help you get on
the right side of the line

947
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:21,005
and do for you what
he should've done, Bobby.

948
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:27,712
He's changed in prison.

949
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:30,383
I'm telling you,
something's changed him.

950
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,154
- He's not the same guy.
- (Door opens)

951
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:35,992
They're still holding.
What shall I tell 'em?

952
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,263
Can I count on your co-operation?

953
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:43,896
Yeah, yeah, Bobby. I'm here. Yeah.

954
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,303
Yeah, that's his hotel.

955
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:53,472
Yeah, all right. Sure.

956
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,785
- What?
- Plan B is now in effect.

957
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,981
I hope you don't get airsick.

958
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,481
Get in the car.

959
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,220
- Hola, señor.
- Hola, Señor Welbach.

960
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:46,165
Has the US Consulate called back yet?

961
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,701
No, sir, not yet.

962
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:53,139
Look, this is a muy, muy important
call. I've lost my passport, OK?

963
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,336
I'll be sitting right there.
I'm not gonna move.

964
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:58,641
Do you see that man over there?

965
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:02,038
Yeah.

966
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:05,142
- That's Mr. Williamson.
- So?

967
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,017
He's been waiting
for that very same call.

968
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:11,786
Really? What, the whole morning?

969
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:15,023
- Since March, señor.
- Oh, come on!

970
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:19,493
(Phone)

971
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,961
Hotel de la Plaza.

972
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:25,734
Yes, as a matter of fact,
he's right here.

973
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,207
Señor, it's for you.

974
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:31,404
Oh. Oh. Hey. Yes, hello?

975
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:36,416
You bastard. Hello? Like, "Hello, my
life is great. Everything is fine."

976
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,009
- Sam?
- 'I thought you could be dead.'

977
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:41,817
I was worried sick
and you answer "Hello,"

978
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:44,518
like you're confirming
a room service order?!

979
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:48,394
Sam? Sam?

980
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:52,057
I'm done with Mr. Jerry Welbach.
Mr. "Hi". No, no.

981
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,330
- (Leroy) 'Ask about the gun.'
- Is that Leroy?

982
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:58,964
- 'Did he fucking touch you?'
- Do you have any idea

983
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,133
what I have just been through?

984
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:05,509
Multiply it by 1,000 and you'll have
a vague conception of where I'm at.

985
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:09,516
Oh! Oh, isn't that typical, Jerry?
It's all a competition!

986
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:13,987
- Tit for tat, tat for tit...
- Stop yelling, for Christ's sake!

987
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:16,649
How are you? Are you OK?
Are you all right?

988
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:20,456
- 'Where are you?'
- Toluca airport, Jerry.

989
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:23,122
And things are shitty, really shitty!

990
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,258
Tell him if he shows up with
the pistol, it'll be OK.

991
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:29,326
'He doesn't care.
He only cares about himself.'

992
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:32,669
Why are you airing
personal matters with strangers?

993
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:36,507
Oh, let me see. Uh, I don't think
that you really classify

994
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:41,310
someone who you just perpetrated
a killing with a fucking stranger!

995
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,817
And I can't find my Kotex cards
or my credit cards...

996
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,580
Sam, what did you say?

997
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,519
Jerry, just settle down.

998
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,217
What'd you do to her?

999
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:54,819
- Jerry, just settle down. OK?
- Yeah.

1000
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,490
We had a situation
but I'm a professional

1001
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:59,396
and I know what I'm doing.

1002
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:02,231
So why don't we chill out
a minute here?

1003
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:06,330
- 'Now, what happened? You get lost?'
- Yeah, five years ago.

1004
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:10,309
- What did you...? I can't hear you.
- No, nothing. Nothing.

1005
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:12,972
Nothing. I hope you have something.

1006
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,209
Yeah, you just... You don't...

1007
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:18,285
Make sure you return her
with all ten toes.

1008
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,878
- Huh?
- 'I understand. I understand.'

1009
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:25,085
'Just come down here, pick us up.
We'll square things away.'

1010
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:27,252
You got a very special woman here.

1011
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:30,388
But we all know
how you can get, right?

1012
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:32,194
- 'So none of that.'
- What?

1013
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,292
This is a time for selflessness.

1014
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,635
What? Wha...?

1015
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:42,609
- You all right?
- Yeah, come on.

1016
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:48,315
Stupid gun.

1017
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,653
Out!

1018
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,833
(Leroy) I have to ask you a question.

1019
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,242
And it's an important one

1020
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:22,773
so I want you to think about the
answer before you give it to me, OK?

1021
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,751
OK.

1022
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:30,449
When two people really love each
other but they can't get it together,

1023
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:34,086
when do you get to that point
where enough is enough?

1024
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,928
That... Oh, well, that's...
You know?

1025
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:44,700
Um, you know it's over when...

1026
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:50,802
OK, I have, like, these psychosomatic
insomniatic manifestations of...

1027
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:53,176
Well, here's the thing about me.

1028
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:57,776
I'm a product of my emotions, not a
product of my environment, like him,

1029
01:25:57,852 --> 01:26:02,551
which he is, exactly,
just that environmental...

1030
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:05,923
I-I need sunshine to grow.
That's who I am.

1031
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,326
And with the projection of...

1032
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,866
I have goals.

1033
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:20,564
- That's your answer?
- Yeah.

1034
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:27,742
That's not right.

1035
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:31,444
I mean, there's a right answer here,
but that's not it.

1036
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:41,423
Look, in my business
you're surrounded...

1037
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:44,192
by loneliness and finality.

1038
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,892
I don't care what your take is
on an afterlife,

1039
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:52,838
when people die, it's scary,
and they go alone.

1040
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:58,303
Now, the people that I send off,

1041
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:01,815
that have experienced love...

1042
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,078
They're a little less scared.

1043
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:07,883
They're still scared,
but there's a calmness to 'em.

1044
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:12,655
I think that comes from the knowledge
that somebody somewhere loved 'em

1045
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,252
and cared for 'em and will miss 'em.

1046
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:21,696
Now, I see that from time to time
and I am awed by it.

1047
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:32,445
I don't think I'd be telling you this
if it wasn't for Frank.

1048
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:38,151
Anyway, it's a loaded question.

1049
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:42,485
Look, when two people
love each other, totally, truthfully,

1050
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:45,048
all the way love each other,

1051
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:49,756
the answer to that question
is simple, especially in your case.

1052
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:55,394
When do you get to that point
where enough is enough?

1053
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,131
Never.

1054
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,469
Never.

1055
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:06,271
I just hope Jerry's not stupid.

1056
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:30,230
What is he driving?!

1057
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:07,265
It's a funky rental.

1058
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:15,507
I know we're all
a little grouchy right now.

1059
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,483
We'll get something to eat,

1060
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:21,316
you'll get the pistol
and then we'll go our separate ways.

1061
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:24,017
- Really separate ways.
- Don't start.

1062
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,754
Shut up.
I'll start because I have the...

1063
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:29,296
Why do you do that?
Do not tell me to shut up.

1064
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,389
- I count.
- We had an agreement.

1065
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:34,333
- Shut up.
- Why don't we all shut up a bit?

1066
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:38,303
- I swear, I will crash this car.
- Jerry, don't do that.

1067
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:42,639
I will. One more word out of you.
Another word, Sam. One more word.

1068
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:44,769
I swear to fucking God.

1069
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:46,473
Naugahyde.

1070
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,141
- All right.
- Jerry!

1071
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,809
- You finished?
- Yes!

1072
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,080
- You gonna shut up?
- Yes, yes, yes!

1073
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:55,588
Jerry, I will, I will!

1074
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,521
(Sam screaming)

1075
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:03,693
Stop the car, Jerry!
Stop the car.

1076
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:10,236
(Sam) Stop, stop, stop!

1077
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,704
Oh, my God!

1078
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:21,677
(Horn)

1079
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,876
(Driver) Pendejo!

1080
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:28,280
Jerry...I want you to know,

1081
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,756
you're the craziest fuck I ever met.

1082
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:38,729
You know what? Go!
Go to Vegas. I've had it!

1083
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:11,087
Son of a bitch!

1084
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:13,531
I had a flat down in Florida once.

1085
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:16,762
Out in the middle of nowhere.

1086
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:21,500
So I go to the trunk,
there's no spare.

1087
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:25,512
Four hours in the baking sun,
waiting for a truck to come by.

1088
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:28,549
Ow!

1089
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:30,516
Now I always check.

1090
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:53,667
Let me give it a rip.

1091
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:59,839
Sometimes you need a little more
torque, you know what I mean?

1092
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:05,079
Wouldn't kill the bastards
to oil these every once in a while.

1093
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:07,211
Fucking car rentals.

1094
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:08,915
Yeah.

1095
01:32:25,506 --> 01:32:27,667
(Gunshot)

1096
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,958
- Walk away, baby.
- What did you do?

1097
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:50,928
He was gonna kill us.

1098
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:53,933
What the fuck did you do?
Look at his head!

1099
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:58,028
Stop! Stop! Listen, listen.
I met Leroy in 1997.

1100
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:00,630
- And that's not him!
- No, no, Jerry.

1101
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,868
You made a terrible mistake.

1102
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:06,402
He was my friend!
You made a terrible mistake!

1103
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,574
Baby, Leroy is black. Leroy's black.

1104
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:12,579
- OK?
- No.

1105
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:15,019
- Yes! He's black.
- No.

1106
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:17,716
African-American. A person of color.

1107
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:21,922
The guy he killed in Vegas is Leroy.
That's Margolese's Leroy.

1108
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:24,725
So, this guy...

1109
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:28,030
Oh, I'm such an ass.
Such an ass. Of course.

1110
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:32,505
"Give the gun to Leroy. He'll get it
down to Margolese." Ha fuckin' ha!

1111
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:34,700
You see? Do you see?

1112
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:37,437
I'm being set up!

1113
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:41,106
Nayman hires this prick
to take out Leroy,

1114
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:45,208
get the gun and pin it all
on Jack-off Jerry.

1115
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,948
Isn't that right, Mr. Winston Baldry?

1116
01:33:48,022 --> 01:33:51,856
I met Leroy and there's no way
you could have known that.

1117
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:55,384
And that's your mistake.
You fucked up.

1118
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:15,312
I can't believe it.

1119
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:18,715
Every fucking time.
Every fucking time, I fuck up.

1120
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:22,313
Not this time. This time, I win.

1121
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,620
This time, I win!

1122
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:27,593
I fucking win! I win!

1123
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:36,366
Oh, my God.

1124
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:41,941
I'm lucky I didn't
lose you three days ago.

1125
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,542
I wanna go home.

1126
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:14,197
Did you call about your passport?
Did you call the consulate?

1127
01:35:14,275 --> 01:35:16,470
Yeah.

1128
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,774
Do you have enough money?

1129
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:22,405
Yeah, I'm all right.

1130
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:09,990
I wanna ask you a question.

1131
01:36:11,465 --> 01:36:13,660
It's a good one, so think about it.

1132
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:30,178
If two people love each other...

1133
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:34,187
but they just can't seem
to get it together...

1134
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:41,055
when do you get to that point
of enough is enough?

1135
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:47,061
Never.

1136
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,341
They'll call.

1137
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:37,873
I've left 60 messages.
I said it was an emergency.

1138
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:44,181
Why would Nayman ask you
if you like sex and travel?

1139
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:46,486
W-w-what is it supposed to mean?

1140
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,757
That you fool around or something?
Is that...

1141
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:53,823
I tell you the whole, long debacle
and this you have a problem with?

1142
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:56,903
Yeah, I do.
I think that when you ask someone

1143
01:37:56,971 --> 01:38:00,202
who is involved
in a relationship of the heart

1144
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:04,574
if they like sex and travel, that...
that's m-m-mean-spirited.

1145
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:08,706
It's stupid. I'll tell you this,
we're not running any more, no.

1146
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:13,219
No, no. So done with the running.
The packing and the running and...

1147
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,289
Sooner or later,
that phone is gonna ring.

1148
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:18,985
We are going to get
your passport in order

1149
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:21,857
and you are gonna give the gun
to Margolese.

1150
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:25,456
Nayman is fucking Margolese.
That has nothing to do with us.

1151
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:27,796
By the grace of God,
I don't know what,

1152
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:31,531
you have managed to Forrest Gump
your way through this.

1153
01:38:31,605 --> 01:38:34,802
And just, if we run now...

1154
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:37,810
we're gonna be running
the rest of our lives.

1155
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:43,641
We want our life back.

1156
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,777
Yes, baby, we do.

1157
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:52,654
(Jerry) No, that can't be right.
Can you just check again?

1158
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,092
Ow! Baby, don't. Margolese.

1159
01:38:55,162 --> 01:38:57,392
M as in Mary.

1160
01:38:57,464 --> 01:39:01,491
Baby, can you turn that down?
You don't even speak Spanish.

1161
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:05,163
Real emotion
transcends language, Jerry.

1162
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:08,264
You don't have to understand
to hear their pain.

1163
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:11,606
No, that's impossible. That's...

1164
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:15,671
Do you know when? Ay-yi-yi!

1165
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:17,774
No, no, all right. All right.

1166
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:21,309
Margolese is out.
He got out this morning. He's out.

1167
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:24,414
What's going on?
He's not due out till Thursday.

1168
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:27,255
It is Thursday, hon.

1169
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:29,625
(Dog barking)

1170
01:39:34,368 --> 01:39:36,962
- What is it?
- Shh. Come on.

1171
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:39,562
Just stay away from the window.

1172
01:39:41,742 --> 01:39:43,801
Shit. Shit.

1173
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:48,104
Here, give me it.

1174
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,911
Good one.

1175
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:02,961
What is it, boy?

1176
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:08,561
Hey!

1177
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,561
Get out of there.

1178
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,476
Come on, man. You're freaking me out.

1179
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:55,208
Huh?

1180
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:58,647
Ow.

1181
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:13,896
Where are you taking me?

1182
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:19,163
It's not your fault
you know nothing about this gun.

1183
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:23,835
You're American.
This gun does not belong to you.

1184
01:42:20,434 --> 01:42:22,265
(Whispering)

1185
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:29,567
Mr. Margolese.

1186
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:38,283
Well, I-I... I don't understand.

1187
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:42,512
What's it gonna take, Jerry?

1188
01:42:42,589 --> 01:42:44,250
What?

1189
01:42:44,391 --> 01:42:46,154
For the gun, Jerry.

1190
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:49,559
What's it gonna take for you
to give it to me and not to another?

1191
01:42:51,798 --> 01:42:53,823
You... Man!

1192
01:42:55,536 --> 01:42:57,367
What'll it take?

1193
01:42:57,437 --> 01:43:01,339
I don't know what it takes.
I'm new in the "fuck you" business.

1194
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:05,640
- You tell me, what does it take?
- I didn't fuck you, Jerry.

1195
01:43:05,712 --> 01:43:08,408
I had Nayman send you down here,

1196
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:11,541
but I didn't know
he was looking for a buyer.

1197
01:43:11,618 --> 01:43:15,452
When I found out he was,
I didn't know who on my team was...

1198
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:18,423
still on my team,
or even if there was a damn team.

1199
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:22,188
Who...? Who the fuck are these guys?

1200
01:43:22,262 --> 01:43:24,822
They work for this man, Tropillo.

1201
01:43:24,898 --> 01:43:28,390
And who the fuck is Trop...?
You know? Not important.

1202
01:43:28,502 --> 01:43:33,132
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't
fight to not give you the gun.

1203
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:35,675
If it comes to that,
someone will leave here

1204
01:43:35,742 --> 01:43:39,234
missing an ear
or not being able to fuck any more.

1205
01:43:39,346 --> 01:43:43,077
One reason, now that you let me know
what you think I'm made of.

1206
01:43:48,388 --> 01:43:50,253
Are you a fatalist, Jerry?

1207
01:43:50,324 --> 01:43:53,691
Uh, I never really thought about it.

1208
01:43:55,495 --> 01:43:59,556
Por favor... Gracias.

1209
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:04,767
When you do think about it,

1210
01:44:04,871 --> 01:44:10,275
about that afternoon you smashed
into my life, into my car,

1211
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:12,812
ever think there's anything to that?

1212
01:44:14,381 --> 01:44:16,941
I honestly never thought about it.

1213
01:44:18,952 --> 01:44:21,011
Because of that afternoon,

1214
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:25,218
I'm doomed to remember a backwards
inmate with a paper clipping.

1215
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:30,988
When you're in jail, a small box...

1216
01:44:31,064 --> 01:44:34,932
you learn a lot about the fella
you're in a cage with.

1217
01:44:37,871 --> 01:44:42,433
I grew to love that boy,
like he was my own son.

1218
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:44,739
But he was his.

1219
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:49,513
One day the boy came to me
with a clipping.

1220
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:53,986
"This is my destiny.
This is my birthright."

1221
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:56,385
It was a story about the pistol...

1222
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:59,892
how they found it
in the mines, stashed away.

1223
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,952
When I asked why
it meant so much to him,

1224
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:05,861
the story he told changed my life.

1225
01:45:09,036 --> 01:45:12,836
(Tropillo's son) 'The night
before the nobleman's arrival,

1226
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:17,934
'the assistant could not sleep...
his heart in aching pain.'

1227
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:27,348
'The day was here when
the gunsmith would present

1228
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:29,615
'his gift to the nobleman.

1229
01:45:37,964 --> 01:45:41,832
'The nobleman's son
was a notoriously vicious soldier,

1230
01:45:41,902 --> 01:45:44,564
'worldly and wicked.

1231
01:45:44,638 --> 01:45:49,405
'For him, his father demanded
something more beautiful,

1232
01:45:49,476 --> 01:45:53,207
'more perfect than
he'd ever laid eyes on before.

1233
01:45:53,313 --> 01:45:59,377
'But nothing, no words or description
could have given justice to it...

1234
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:03,014
'or have prepared him
for that gun's flawless grace.

1235
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:10,492
'When the nobleman's son
saw his intended bride-to-be...

1236

All right. All right, Nayman,
where are the keys?

1303

I might have lost them.

1304

do not pull that trigger. No.

I... I will pull
this fucking trigger.

Put the gun down. OK?

1313

Put it down.

OK?

He's right, it's not worth it.

Don't you know when enough is enough?

Do you like sex and travel?

1320

As a matter of fact, I do.

Am I OK? Yeah, I'm OK. You OK?

1328

Huh?

1329

- May I?
- It would be our honor.

Yeah.

Seal it.

Do you love me, Jerry?

1333

I adore you, sweetheart.

1334
01:57:05,618 --> 01:57:07,848
Then tell me it again.

1335
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:12,880
- I've already told you three times.
- Just one more time. Please. Please.

1336
01:57:16,562 --> 01:57:21,022
The pistol was crafted for a
noble man by a poor Mexican gunsmith.

1337
01:57:21,134 --> 01:57:22,829
- Nobleman.
- Hmm?

1338
01:57:22,902 --> 01:57:25,803
- It's nobleman. One word.
- What did I say?

1339
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:27,772
What difference does it make?

1340
01:57:27,907 --> 01:57:30,000
- It doesn't.
- Why correct me?

1341
01:57:30,076 --> 01:57:33,739
- English is your mother tongue.
- I'm calling a time-out!

- (Hotel clerk) Raoul!
