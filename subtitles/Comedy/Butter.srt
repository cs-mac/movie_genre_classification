1
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,150
I believe in America.

2
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:21,186
I believe we are the best.

3
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,321
I believe we're number one.

4
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:25,623
And I won't apologize for that.

5
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,560
My husband and I are survivors.

6
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,862
We fought tooth and nail to
get to where we are today.

7
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:33,631
How? The old-fashioned way:

8
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,201
hard work and
a can-do attitude.

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,669
And here in the great state
of Iowa no less,

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,341
where all great battles begin.

11
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:44,876
My name is Laura Dean Pickler

12
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,645
and this is the cutthroat story

13
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:50,252
of greed, blackmail,
sex and butter.

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,289
Bob? Bob Pickler?

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,158
Bob Pickler, where are ya?

16
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,660
Ah, there you are.
Stand up for us, please.

17
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:05,130
That's us.
The Picklers. Bob and Laura.

18
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,433
We were the royal family
of butter carving.

19
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,834
Oh, sure, laugh.
But did you know more people

20
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:13,305
saw the butter sculptures of
the Iowa State Fair last year

21
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:17,475
than went to the Super Bowl?
No, of course you didn't.

22
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:21,215
How could you, with the
liberal media as biased as it is?

23
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:26,217
Would you dim
the lights, please?

24
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:28,720
Sit down and watch this.

25
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:34,559
Oh, I come to the Iowa State Fair every
year and that's mainly because of Bob.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,296
Born into poverty
in Battle Creek, Iowa in 1968,

27
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:41,266
Bob Pickler found solace
in his best friend,

28
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,636
a young calf named Suki.

29
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:48,306
But tragedy arrived when Bob
was just eight years old.

30
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:51,409
Suki was struck dead
by lightning.

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,546
Distraught, Bob carved
a likeness of his beloved Suki

32
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,716
with the only thing the Picklers had
in the icebox... a block of butter.

33
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:02,887
Even though his mother destroyed
young Bob's first sculpture,

34
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:05,523
Bob was bit by the
butter-carving bug.

35
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:08,258
He first entered the
Mastery in Butter competition

36
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,894
15 years ago,
his lovely wife Laura

37
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,430
encouraging him
every step of the way.

38
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:16,768
With a controversial,
yet staggeringly elegant piece

39
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,237
titled
"Newt Gingrich on Horse."

40
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:21,206
Hey, hon.
What do you think?

41
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,774
Look at Newt.

42
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,643
Oh, it's great.
How do you like my haircut?

43
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:30,751
I'd better like it.
It cost me 15 bucks.

44
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:34,452
I'm worth it.

45
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:38,690
Get over here. Aww!

46
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,758
Thus began his
unprecedented winning streak

47
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,895
that included the world-famous
"T-Rex Eating Girl."

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,800
- Well, back in '94...
- It was '95.

49
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:54,305
- Well, '94...
- It was '95.

50
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:58,675
OK. We'll call it '95.
'94, actually, but...

51
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:03,648
Bob comes out and reveals his piece.
"Schindler's List."

52
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:06,454
"Schindler's List!"

53
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,488
- Here we go.
- Sorry.

54
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,925
It just made me cry.

55
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:15,827
And we're not even Jewish.

56
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,828
But no one could imagine
the showstopper

57
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,000
the boy from Battle Creek
would pull out this year.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,734
A life-size replica
of "The Last Supper"

59
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:26,937
that the Des Moines Register
called "better than the original."

60
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:30,441
I really think Bob and I
could parlay this fame

61
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,877
we have from butter
into politics.

62
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,347
I mean, don't be surprised if you
see us in the Governor's mansion,

63
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,585
or the White House.

64
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,386
This is just the beginning.

65
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:45,857
Bob Pickler,
ladies and gentlemen!

66
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,295
Fifteen wonderful years!

67
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:52,530
Butter was my world...

68
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,068
...until it all came
crashing down.

69
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:00,071
If you can believe it, the
first time I saw Mrs. Pickler

70
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,008
I actually wished she and
Mr. Pickler would take me in.

71
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,411
You know, of
course the awards are wonderful.

72
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,314
But what is most satisfying
to me, and to Bob,

73
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,684
is the attention we bring
to our charity, Camp Butter.

74
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:15,953
- Yes.
- Where we help children with special needs.

75
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:19,357
The foster people had just
put me with a bunch of families

76
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,559
and anyone had to
be better than them.

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,761
First was the Moores.

78
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:27,498
They were home-schoolers,
which always spells trouble.

79
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:32,837
And then God
cast down the angels

80
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:34,739
and they fell to earth,

81
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,514
which is where
dinosaur bones come from.

82
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:47,352
Next came Mrs. Carmichael.
She was on pills.

83
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:52,590
Just tell the doctor you've been
anxious lately and you need Klonopin.

84
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,991
OK. Klonopin.

85
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,761
You're gonna be such
a great daughter.

86
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:02,100
- I liked her.
- Stupid child-proof cap.

87
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,934
She was always so calm.

88
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,940
Here, you try.

89
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,842
Too calm to run from the police, I guess.

90
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,012
They're not mine!

91
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,647
So after that came the Gundersons.

92
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,082
They were old.

93
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,585
The red button is
for the ambulance.

94
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:24,588
Tell her about the red button.

95
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:28,826
So you can understand why I wasn't
on to Mrs. Pickler's bull sooner.

96
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:31,061
Plus, I was only
ten at the time.

97
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:34,601
Now that I'm 11,
I know the truth.

98
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,706
White people are weirdos.

99
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,474
Did they find my mom yet?

100
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,876
Come on, sweetheart.
It's late.

101
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:48,589
Your room's still empty.

102
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,857
Thank you.

103
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,810
"Pickin' Up The Pieces"

104
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,050
Excuse me.

105
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,033
Wow!

106
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:18,802
Laura Dean Pickler!

107
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:21,007
- Hi, Carol Ann Stevenson.
- Hey, Carol Ann.

108
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,909
Look at you,
you look just amazing.

109
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,578
It's brave of you to wear stirrup
pants with your body type.

110
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,213
Thank you. My pants keep
riding up

111
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,683
and I need to
pull them down with my feet.

112
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,251
They're hard to find,

113
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,932
Ill say that, but I found 'em.

114
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:50,066
Hey there.

115
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,942
Can I have a look at that?

116
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,610
Wow.

117
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,546
You're good.

118
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,982
Really good.

119
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:05,715
A real natural.

120
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:08,954
You're a quiet one, aren't ya?

121
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:14,157
That's OK.
So was John Wayne, so...

122
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:15,896
Can I borrow this?

123
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:21,933
Bob makes butter
carving look so easy.

124
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,768
I even think I could do it
sometimes.

125
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:27,740
Then I'm like, "Wake up,
Carol Ann! You're in a dream!"

126
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,777
That summer, they put me
with Miss Jill and Mr. Ethan.

127
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:37,315
They were the whitest people I'd ever met.

128
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,350
I wasn't expecting
to stay very long.

129
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:43,720
These people always
get cold feet.

130
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:46,226
This will be your bedroom.

131
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,695
It's pink.

132
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,098
Yeah. I told her
to go with green.

133
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,370
No, it's pretty.

134
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,838
- There's a TV?
- Oh, yeah.

135
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,874
It's not HD though, so, sorry.

136
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,210
And no watching past eight.

137
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,710
Is that what we said, eight?

138
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,778
- No TV past nine.
- Nine, right.

139
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,880
Eight, what is this, prison?

140
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:11,949
"Lights out!"

141
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:17,321
Um...

142
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:20,957
- Is there anything you need?
- No. Thank you.

143
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,860
What do you like to do for fun?
Do you have hobbies?

144
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:26,830
We can buy you some stuff,
like books or a globe.

145
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:29,100
I'm not really
that good at anything.

146
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:33,903
Oh... What? That's crazy.
Everybody's good at something.

147
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:36,279
Not me.
My last mom told me so.

148
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,349
Well, you don't have to worry about
stuff like that anymore, OK?

149
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,351
- OK.
- So if you need us, you know.

150
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:51,088
- We'll be out there.
- Yeah. "Paging Mom and Dad."

151
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:54,796
- OK. OK.
- All right.

152
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,864
One, two, three, Camp Butter!

153
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:05,436
I've always said that your
people are the small flashlights

154
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:08,672
that help a dark world
find its lost car keys.

155
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:12,308
- What?
- Let's hear it for Camp Butter!

156
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:15,845
What can I do you for, Orval?

157
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:20,350
Look, the panel's
been doing some talking,

158
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:24,754
and, uh...
you've had a good run.

159
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,322
Well, 15 years.

160
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:27,758
You're a legend.

161
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,326
You're in Parade Magazine.

162
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:32,095
You're the Elvis of butter.

163
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:36,332
But we just kinda feel
like it's time...

164
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,240
...you gave
somebody else a shot.

165
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,941
Uh-huh.

166
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:47,210
We're prepared to offer
you a spot at State.

167
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,913
Um... you could be a judge.

168
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:54,019
With me and Mary Alice
and Carl Hudgens.

169
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,390
- Carl Hudgens is a good guy.
- He's a great guy.

170
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,960
It's time to start giving back.

171
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,428
You know, like Oprah does.

172
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:08,231
Yeah, well, she's got
that Angel Network.

173
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:12,103
I just have one
sort of delicate question.

174
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,272
- Laura?
- Laura.

175
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,942
You know,
I really think that Bob

176
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,909
could be an excellent mayor.

177
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,845
or even, or even governor.

178
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,383
'Cause I know she's...

179
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:28,885
...she's very, uh... involved.

180
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,988
Oh, she's fine.
She'll be fine.

181
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,024
Laura...

182
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,162
These fuckers have no idea
who they're dealing with.

183
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,331
We're the motherfucking
Picklers.

184
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,901
Clearly Orval wanted you
out of the way.

185
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,304
I have always known
what kind of man he was.

186
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,038
I never thought
he'd go this far.

187
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,407
You know Orval is a good man.

188
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,317
He has had it out for us
from day one, Bob.

189
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,917
I will call the governor.

190
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:03,086
That's what I'll do.
I'll call the governor.

191
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:06,090
Or Jesus. I mean, don't you
have his direct line?

192
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:09,560
My constitutional rights are being
violated and I will call the governor.

193
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,928
The governor
doesn't care, Laura.

194
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,236
What did you say?

195
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:22,282
The governor doesn't care.

196
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,215
Whose side are you on, Bob?

197
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:36,255
It's time to pass
the baton, Laura.

198
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,325
I need to start giving back.

199
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,591
Like Oprah.

200
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:44,869
How dare you
bring Oprah into this?

201
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,970
Kaitlen, sweetie.

202
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,473
Could you please provide your
father and me with some privacy?

203
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,576
She can stay.

204
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,485
Cover your balls, Dad.

205
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,255
I see what happened here, Bob.

206
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,957
You didn't stand up
for yourself, did you?

207
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,226
That's what happened here.

208
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:19,229
I think it'd show a real touch
of class if we stepped down now.

209
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,332
I guess Dad was right when he
warned me against marrying someone

210
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,302
whose biggest dream was to be
the middle school principal.

211
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,404
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It just means maybe I should've taken his advice

212
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,907
- and married Boyd Bolton.
- Boyd Bolton?

213
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:34,577
At least he inherited a
successful car dealership.

214
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,316
I am done.

215
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:41,985
I doubt Boyd would just give up Bolton
Supercenter at the drop of a hat, Bob.

216
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,586
Laura, please.

217
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:46,257
You get back here, Bob.

218
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,328
If you won't stand up to them,
then I will!

219
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,667
Fucking freaks.

220
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,167
I gotta ask you, you just turned
down over a half a million dollars.

221
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:33,303
I told her not to pick 22.

222
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,383
Oh, shit! Tell her I'm not here.

223
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:49,485
What? Who? What's going on?

224
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,956
- Laura. Laura Pickler.
- Oh, God. Here?

225
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,558
- Tell her I'm fishing.
- At night?

226
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,393
Oh, God! Why is she here?

227
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,162
- Orval!
- What if she gets inside?

228
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:02,499
- Orval!
- Can you hear me?

229
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,671
I hear you!

230
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:09,373
- One is worth $200,000.
- Yeah.

231
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:12,375
One case is worth one million.

232
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:18,581
Laura.

233
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:21,185
How nice to see you.

234
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,253
Where's Orval?

235
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,061
He's in the shower.

236
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:33,138
Maybe I can have him
call you later.

237
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:42,755
I'll wait.

238
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:01,399
If you ask me,
number 24 is too thin.

239
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,566
Oh, I see how it is.

240
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,469
He wants to play a game, does he?

241
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,271
Well, you tell
Orval this isn't over.

242
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:26,264
That's what I'm
talking about, baby!

243
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,335
# Only love makes you kill #

244
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:48,205
# Breaks your legs
breaks your will #

245
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:54,114
# Pulls you up by the roots #

246
00:16:56,114 --> 00:17:01,250
# Makes you fall down too #

247
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,253
# Harder #

248
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:04,555
# Deeper #

249
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,856
# Faster #

250
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:08,525
# Harder #

251
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:09,727
# Deeper #

252
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,131
# Faster #

253
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,797
# Harder #

254
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,133
# Deeper #

255
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,836
# Faster #

256
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,269
# Harder #

257
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,472
# Deeper #

258
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,410
# Faster #

259
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,209
How are they gonna
do it without me?

260
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,213
Who's gonna throw
the Butter Brunch, Helen?

261
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,614
Please.

262
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:35,184
And Camp Butter. It doesn't
just organize itself.

263
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:40,156
And to think, I was just about to donate all
my past gala gowns to the state fair museum.

264
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:42,191
Ohh.

265
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,563
I give so much.

266
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:48,499
You're the only man
who cares about me.

267
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,768
That's not true. I'm sure there
is plenty of men who like you.

268
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,203
Your father cares
about you, right?

269
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:56,405
My father raped me.

270
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,174
Oh, my God!

271
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:02,211
I just... I need
someone to take care of me.

272
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:05,249
Someone who understands me,
someone to love me.

273
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,284
Not just someone to pay my rent

274
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:11,555
which, by the way, comes out
to $560 a month plus utilities.

275
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:13,191
That's actually
a really good deal.

276
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,659
But listen, Tokyo Rose...

277
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,264
- What? What?
- Oh, my.

278
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,566
- What?
- Tokyo Rose...

279
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:26,305
Brooke.
My real name's Brooke.

280
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,538
Brooke.

281
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:31,541
I think I love you.

282
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,442
- Too soon?
- No.

283
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:36,646
Here we go, um...
Here, I wanna give you...

284
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:39,348
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

285
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:42,786
Oh, I couldn't
possibly accept this.

286
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,488
No.

287
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:47,527
Oh, that's a hundy.

288
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:53,432
You are such a good person.

289
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,869
Mmm.

290
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,838
You just give and give
and give, and others

291
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,941
just take and take and take...

292
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:07,480
Oh, fuck!

293
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:16,789
But my strongest belief in life is
that you should always take the high road.

294
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:23,430
What the fuck?!

295
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,797
She had tattoos, Bob.

296
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:29,766
How long has this been going on?

297
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,501
It's just the one time. Look.

298
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:34,270
Oh! Sweet Jesus!

299
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,406
You're not innocent
in this whole thing, OK?

300
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:38,776
You're sleeping
on the couch tonight.

301
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,779
I sleep on
the couch every night.

302
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:47,617
If I were you...
I'd get a good night's sleep.

303
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:50,453
Because County is in a month
and we got a lot of work to do.

304
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:52,956
Laura, it's over. I'm not entering County.
Orval and I agreed.

305
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:55,592
We gotta get the butter,
we gotta sharpen the trowels.

306
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:58,962
We gotta check the cooling unit because the
temperature thing's been all fucked up for ages.

307
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:02,598
- We gotta...
- Listen to me. I'm not competing this year.

308
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,401
I know.

309
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,903
- I am.
- What?

310
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,805
I'm competing.

311
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:10,507
I'll win County.

312
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:14,443
And after that I will bring back
what is rightfully ours.

313
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:16,347
And you're gonna help me.

314
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:19,850
Good night.

315
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,853
There's Advil in the kitchen
for your penis.

316
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,756
So I checked your schedule.
You got Mr. Evans for History.

317
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:29,593
He's very, very old,
so be patient.

318
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:33,596
I actually think he was around for most
of the historical events that he covers.

319
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,799
Here we are.

320
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,870
You'll be fine.

321
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,705
I'll be in room 412
if you need me.

322
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,339
Just a short walk away.

323
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,477
- OK.
- OK.

324
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,650
Go get 'em.

325
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,383
When you draw your tree,

326
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,987
I want you to rid
your conscious mind

327
00:20:56,988 --> 00:21:01,061
of any notion of what you think
a tree should look like.

328
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:07,463
Here.
You can use mine.

329
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:10,407
- I have two.
- Thanks.

330
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,375
You know black people?

331
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,678
Yeah.

332
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,681
Well, I wanted you to know

333
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:26,549
I think they're real cool.

334
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,057
Thanks.

335
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:39,363
Destiny. I wanted to tell you how
thrilled I am to have you in my class.

336
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,698
You're a very talented artist.

337
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,070
I'm not really that good.

338
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,747
We expect big things from you.

339
00:21:55,747 --> 00:22:00,083
My new foster parents and
everyone at my new school were so nice,

340
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:03,026
that I couldn't help but think,
are these crackers for real?

341
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:12,929
You know how you guys asked if
I needed anything a while back?

342
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,765
Mm-hmm. Shoot.

343
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,603
You don't have butter.

344
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:22,706
Thank you. I know. It's Jill.

345
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:26,143
Believe me, she means well.
You know, she used to be worse.

346
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,045
She used to buy this
fake meat called seitan.

347
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:32,149
- Like the devil?
- Exactly like the devil.

348
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,951
- I'll get you some. Yeah.
- Really?

349
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:38,154
OK. I'm gonna need
like 200 pounds.

350
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,528
# It feels good to be home #

351
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:50,769
Honey.

352
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,636
Honey, just...

353
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:55,538
She's coming.

354
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,915
Here it comes.

355
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:06,450
Thank you.

356
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,486
- Beautiful chicken.
- Thank you.

357
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:13,656
Well, Kaitlen, your father
and I have some great news.

358
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:17,928
As you know the Mastery in Butter
Committee has turned on your father

359
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,564
like Judas Iscariot himself.

360
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,866
The good news is that,
instead of your father

361
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:27,970
I will be competing this year.

362
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,774
- I think we should be proud of your mother.
- Stepmother.

363
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:33,010
And have you ever made a butter
sculpture before?

364
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,212
You don't even eat dairy.

365
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:39,516
Oh, man, you are
gonna suck so hard.

366
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:43,553
- Kaitlen.
- I guess I expected outsiders to be skeptical,

367
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:44,857
but my own family?

368
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:50,192
I have stood by your father
for the past 15 years.

369
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:52,962
Watching, learning, absorbing.

370
00:23:52,963 --> 00:24:00,269
I was there when he turned 867 sticks
of butter into First Lady Laura Bush.

371
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,739
I was there when,
two days before State,

372
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,579
the cooler broke and his Iwo Jima
just turned into a river of yellow.

373
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,283
And I am here now
in his darkest hour of need

374
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:16,888
to lift him up
and preserve our legacy.

375
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,612
Bird or door, Bob.
Pick one. Let's go.

376
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,212
- Hey, boo!
- You can't be here.

377
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:44,779
Oh, but you still owe
me money, remember?

378
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,114
I never got the rest
of the money.

379
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:47,082
That shit ain't free.

380
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,219
This isn't happening.

381
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,120
But you said you loved me, Bob.

382
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,954
That was a little early for me.

383
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:55,592
But we did it. I never do it
with guys from the club, Bob.

384
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,560
Dad? Who's that?

385
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:59,097
Nobody.

386
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:03,165
Nobody?!

387
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,768
- Is she a hooker?
- No, no.

388
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:08,872
- I like her boots.
- Those are Army boots.

389
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:10,172
She's a recruiter.

390
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:12,741
Wait a minute.
Is she your hooker?

391
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:15,812
- Because I totally understand if she is.
- Kaitlen.

392
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,614
Go back to the table right now.

393
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:21,619
Nobody? Nobody?! Bob!

394
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:25,654
Brooke! Can't we
do this over email?

395
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:27,592
Bob, I'm gonna shit
on the hood of your car.

396
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,925
I see. You are definitely
a passionate woman.

397
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:32,796
You have two minutes to get me
that money or I swear to God.

398
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,964
I'm sorry, Brooke, I can't.
I'm married.

399
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,167
You know what? Fuck you!
You are just like my father.

400
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,670
- My wife controls the checkbook.
- Your wife, Bob?

401
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:43,239
I can't believe you're gonna
let your wife come between us.

402
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,642
- I thought you had morals.
- OK.

403
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:47,011
You tell your wife
to watch her back.

404
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,845
Will do. Thanks.

405
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:51,847
Fuck you, Bob!

406
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:54,752
No, thank you.
We have plenty of steak knives.

407
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,159
You owe me, Bob.

408
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,729
You owe me big.

409
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,031
Can I come in?

410
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:10,933
Sure.

411
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:15,238
- So how was your first day?
- Good.

412
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:20,376
Ethan said you were interested in
doing that butter contest thing?

413
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:22,412
Yeah.

414
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,881
Are you sure?

415
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:28,250
It's kind of redneck-y.

416
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:30,288
I don't mind.

417
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:35,094
Looks like you've
been practicing.

418
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:38,394
Who's that?

419
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:44,403
That's my real dad.
And this is my mom.

420
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,103
And this must be you.

421
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:49,706
Don't you look all happy.

422
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:52,441
No. That's my sister.

423
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:55,679
So where are you?

424
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,150
Well, I'm here.

425
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,922
Don't worry. My real mom
will come get me soon.

426
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,989
OK.

427
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,401
Time for bed.

428
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:20,103
- Hey, is she good?
- She's fine.

429
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:22,875
Great.

430
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:28,444
The Secret is within you.

431
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:31,948
The more you use
the power within you,

432
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:35,020
the more you will
draw it to you.

433
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,757
You will reach a point where you
won't need to practice anymore,

434
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:44,259
because you will be the power,
you will be the perfection,

435
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,329
- you will be the wisdom...
- Be the wisdom.

436
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,231
...you will be the intelligence,
you will be the love...

437
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:53,103
- ...you will be the joy.
- Be the joy.

438
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,374
Be the joy.

439
00:27:57,374 --> 00:28:00,075
Oh, God what am I doing here?
I can't do this.

440
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:04,247
I'm not an artist.
I don't have any experience.

441
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,883
I just screwed up The Secret
by even thinking that.

442
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:09,119
Just shut up, Laura. Pull it
together, you stupid slut.

443
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,954
Don't call yourself a slut.
Oh, God.

444
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:14,528
OK.

445
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:20,232
I will win.

446
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,923
I will win.

447
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:49,491
Laura, I thought Bob was
judging State this year.

448
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:53,328
He is.
I'm signing up for myself.

449
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,866
Are you sure?

450
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:01,270
You have big shoes to fill,
following your husband like that.

451
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:04,406
Well, don't worry, I'm not a
feminist or anything like that.

452
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:07,376
I just worry about what would
happen if this title

453
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:09,727
and all the power that
goes with it ends up

454
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:12,184
in the hands of someone
other than a Pickler.

455
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:17,085
I mean, we all know what happened
with the Miss America Pageant

456
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:19,221
and Vanessa Williams.

457
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:21,290
Well, I guess I see your point.

458
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,294
I see I'm the only name here in Johnson County.
What time do we wrap this up?

459
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,400
Official rules state
we need to be here until noon.

460
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,569
I'll wait.

461
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:34,306
Good.

462
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,111
Do you want me to go in
with you?

463
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:42,879
Don't tell Jill,

464
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,315
because she always likes me
to think positive.

465
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,182
but what I like to do is this.

466
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:50,385
I imagine all the bad things

467
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:53,556
that could possibly happen
if you enter this contest.

468
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:59,062
Like you could die
of a tragic butter overdose.

469
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:03,900
There could be a rabid grizzly bear
hiding inside this very moose lodge,

470
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:06,068
waiting to tear your face off.

471
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:07,005
There could be a python inside.

472
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,307
What if this place is full
of monkeys with a deadly virus?

473
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,475
There could be
the ghost of Hitler.

474
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:14,011
What if there's no gravity in there?
And you float up

475
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:17,278
and bang your head on the ceiling.
And then all of a sudden,

476
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,616
gravity kicks in and then you
bang your head on the floor?

477
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,185
- There could be a black hole and it'd suck me all up.
- Yes.

478
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:25,022
What if this place is full of
good-looking British vampires?

479
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:29,258
- The worst of all of them.
- They're so pale.

480
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,995
- Or hungry cannibals.
- It could happen.

481
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:36,633
Or there could be a mass murderer who
only kills adorable little girls.

482
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,501
- Think about it.
- Or racist ninjas.

483
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:43,672
Or racist ninjas, yes.
High five.

484
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:45,475
That was a good one.

485
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,075
So think about all that

486
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:48,511
and ask yourself, really,

487
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:51,514
what's the worst thing
that could happen?

488
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:54,217
I could be terrible and lose.

489
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,451
Yeah.

490
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:57,120
Yeah, could you live with that?

491
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,988
I guess so.

492
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:01,527
OK then. So it's not
such a big deal, is it?

493
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,696
Go make us proud.

494
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:07,998
Bring me back some butter.

495
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,234
Adorable.

496
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:13,281
What is this place?

497
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:26,348
Laura?

498
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:29,652
Oh, my God!

499
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:32,055
Are you entering, too?

500
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,722
Oh, my God!

501
00:31:33,723 --> 00:31:37,326
We have to get coolers right
next to each other!

502
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:39,461
It'll be just like camp!

503
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:40,997
How fun.

504
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:43,333
I'm really nervous.

505
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,702
I mean, what am I doing, right?
But I just said to myself,

506
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:49,706
"Carol Ann, you've been sitting
in the audience for too long.

507
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:53,142
Now's your time to get up on
that stage and sing!"

508
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:55,411
I'm so glad you're here.

509
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:59,582
We're gonna be
just like sisters.

510
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:02,988
Oh, no offense.

511
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,520
I'd like to sign up, please.

512
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:09,296
Oh, isn't that just precious.

513
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:13,030
So, that's that.

514
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,200
Looks like it'll be the three of us.

515
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,233
Is someone smoking?

516
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:21,422
Fuck this bullshit.

517
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,224
Hey.

518
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:42,393
Can I help you?

519
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,626
Yeah.

520
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:47,095
I want to... sign up.

521
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:51,534
For the Johnson County Mastery
in Butter Sculpture Competition?

522
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,702
Oh, man.

523
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:57,239
Yeah. That. I want
to sign up for that.

524
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,109
I'm gonna cut you.

525
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:02,377
Have you worked
with butter before?

526
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:06,783
Oh, I've worked with it all.

527
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,152
- I object.
- Uh...

528
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,054
You know, she is here on time

529
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,390
and the rules do state
that anyone can enter.

530
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:16,159
Look at what she's wearing.

531
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,828
This will go over very badly
with the Red Ribbon people.

532
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:23,468
Well, I don't see anything
in here about that. I really...

533
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:26,538
Ah!

534
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,073
Your husband still owes me
another $600.

535
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:33,142
Interesting. Did he buy
600 blowjobs on credit?

536
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:37,345
Look, lady, you came
in between me and my man.

537
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:39,151
Sh! We're in a Moose Lodge.

538
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:42,318
Bob is my husband.

539
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,188
We have built a life together.

540
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,156
Once Kaitlen leaves, I plan on
proudly bearing his children.

541
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:51,693
So? You want a cookie 'cause
you're gonna get pregnant?

542
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,164
I get pregnant
like once a month.

543
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:56,732
Do you honestly think
you're anything more

544
00:33:56,733 --> 00:34:00,202
than a cheap lay to him?
He'll get bored.

545
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:03,105
After that he'll come right back
where he belongs,

546
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,841
to my house.

547
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,878
Listen...

548
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,647
Would you prefer it
if I didn't enter

549
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:14,417
this whole
butter contest thing?

550
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:17,185
Absolutely.

551
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:18,197
Excellent.

552
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:30,735
It's on, cunt.

553
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:36,171
I haven't heard that word
since my dad died.

554
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:51,257
Heavens! Look at that.

555
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,721
- Voila.
- Cool.

556
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:27,320
Jesus, Laura.

557
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:14,773
Hi!

558
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:18,374
Incredible.

559
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,875
This is weird.

560
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:22,750
Sh, sh, sh.

561
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,318
Honey.

562
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:31,358
This is great.

563
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,306
- What's that?
- I don't know.

564
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:59,281
- Hi, Carol Ann.
- I'm sorry to bother you.

565
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:02,584
I know you're busy
creating in here and...

566
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:04,953
Wow, Laura!

567
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:09,457
Talent does run
in the Pickler family. Wow.

568
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:12,395
- Well...
- Mine? I don't know.

569
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,032
I mean, you know, I thought
it would work out, but...

570
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,966
...golly, Laura,
this is really hard.

571
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,935
But my grandma used to say,
"You can't polish a..."

572
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:22,571
How's the girl's look?

573
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:24,774
- What?
- What's her name?

574
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,042
Destiny?

575
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:36,551
Amazing, isn't it?

576
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:38,788
I think that might be
Harriet Tubman.

577
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,323
Oh.

578
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,658
Well, she obviously decided

579
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:45,393
to play the race card.
I mean, it figures.

580
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:48,897
Whatever you lack in talent,
you gotta find some way to...

581
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:50,499
I gotta go.

582
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,347
"Little Secrets"

583
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:06,016
# Let this be
our little secret #

584
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,084
# No one needs to know
we're feeling #

585
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:14,089
# Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher #

586
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,059
# But I feel alive
Oh, I feel it in me #

587
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,727
# Up and up
we keep on climbing #

588
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:21,564
# Higher and higher
and higher... #

589
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,094
Oh.

590
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:52,895
OK, contestants.

591
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,163
Five, four...

592
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:58,701
...three, two...

593
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,835
...one.

594
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,605
Trowels down!

595
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,012
Ladies and gentlemen.

596
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:45,680
welcome to the
Johnson County Finals

597
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:49,690
for the State Mastery
in Butter Competition.

598
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,660
I would like to introduce our
esteemed panel of judges.

599
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,529
Betsy Lou Holt,
our reigning Miss Dairy.

600
00:40:02,798 --> 00:40:06,639
Mayor of Iowa City,
Bill Olberweis.

601
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:15,109
And finally, State Head Judge
Orval Flanagan's wife,

602
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,212
Mrs. Helen Flanagan.

603
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:26,788
Now, we're going to let each contestant
say a few words about their work

604
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:29,625
before the judges
begin deliberating.

605
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:32,936
Carol Ann Stevenson?

606
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,203
That's mine.

607
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:44,239
I just really love kittens.

608
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,710
Especially when they get tangled
up in a blanket,

609
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:53,883
but I didn't know how to carve that,
so I just put them in a basket.

610
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,852
I hope that's OK.

611
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:58,854
Thank you!

612
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:07,606
Thank you, Carol Ann.
Uh, Brooke?

613
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:19,976
Many of you know that I am
a former stripper...

614
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:23,946
...often taking my job
a step further

615
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:27,181
and engaging in
sexual acts for money.

616
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:31,819
I went from man to man to man,

617
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,857
always looking,
always searching.

618
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:38,761
Then one day,

619
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,931
after I was nearly
beaten to death by a customer...

620
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:44,165
...I stumbled into another house.

621
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:47,803
A big welcoming house.

622
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:50,638
And met another man.

623
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,778
And that man was Jesus Christ.

624
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:03,252
I present to you,
"The Scarlet Letter."

625
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:07,891
For those of you who don't know,
it's a movie starring Demi Moore.

626
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:11,627
Thank you and God bless you.

627
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:13,003
Butter saves!

628
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,871
- Thank you, Brooke...
- Six hundred dollars.

629
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,341
- I don't have it.
- ...for the inspiration.

630
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:29,927
Um, OK. Destiny?

631
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:45,794
Hi. My name is Destiny.

632
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:50,665
My last name is either
Washington or Wilson.

633
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:55,203
The reason I'm not sure is because
the State of Iowa isn't sure.

634
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:59,674
You see, I am,
and have been, a foster child.

635
00:42:59,675 --> 00:43:01,944
I've been shuttled
from home to home.

636
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:04,913
While some of my experiences
have been negative,

637
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:09,283
most of them have been
overwhelmingly positive.

638
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:12,855
So why then, can a
ten-year-old black girl

639
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:17,192
with no family, no money
and no connections

640
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:23,031
stand before you today and believe
that she can win this competition?

641
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:25,234
Why did the Pilgrims
dare to cross

642
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:29,104
the vast, dark oceans
to America?

643
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:30,007
Why did they risk it?

644
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:33,908
And why did a man
named Abraham Lincoln

645
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:37,346
move from a log cabin
to the... No, wait.

646
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:39,982
Move from a log house
to the White House

647
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:44,720
and risk both houses to keep
this great nation together?

648
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:50,759
The same reason a poor black
woman risked life and limb,

649
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,428
partnering with white
and black people alike

650
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:57,101
to bring my ancestors to freedom
on the Underground Railroad.

651
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:00,438
Why?

652
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:06,040
Because she dared to dream.

653
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,343
And that's kinda what
I'm doing here today.

654
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,188
Thank you very much.

655
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,056
How'd you do that?

656
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,091
Wow.

657
00:44:23,092 --> 00:44:24,926
That's a hard act to follow.

658
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:27,428
Oh, um...

659
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:31,265
Last, but, uh, certainly
not least, Laura Pickler!

660
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:34,442
Laura, come on up.

661
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:41,211
Family.

662
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:44,379
When... when I think
about butter

663
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,784
I think about family.

664
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:52,120
Why?

665
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:57,125
Because like the thread
of a grandmother's quilt,

666
00:44:57,126 --> 00:45:00,863
butter is the centerpiece
of a family dinner.

667
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,997
And family, in turn,

668
00:45:02,998 --> 00:45:06,868
is the thread that holds our
great country together.

669
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,303
Without butter,
there is no family,

670
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:12,085
and without family,
there is no...

671
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,831
This is really hard.

672
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,467
Just take your time, dear.

673
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:39,039
Um...

674
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,911
I'd like to remind you
what this contest is about.

675
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:51,949
It is about
"excellence in butter."

676
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:56,250
I have spent my life
working hard,

677
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:59,087
trying to do the right thing.

678
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:03,894
Because I thought that's what
this competition was about.

679
00:46:05,894 --> 00:46:08,400
I just hope when you vote,
you remember that.

680
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,968
Thank you.
God bless America.

681
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:16,610
God bless you, Laura,
God bless you.

682
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:24,014
Thank you, all four of you.

683
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:26,348
How'd I do?

684
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:29,618
You carved two more people
than anyone else.

685
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:32,888
We now have coffee and donut
holes in the back for everyone

686
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:34,324
while the judges deliberate.

687
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,601
Donut holes!

688
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,148
If I may have your attention.

689
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:01,149
We have a decision.

690
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,587
In fourth place,
Carol Ann Stevenson.

691
00:47:05,588 --> 00:47:08,927
Come on, come on!

692
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,129
Congrats, Carol Ann.

693
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,567
Uh, and in third place,
Brooke Swinkowski.

694
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:20,208
What?!

695
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:29,012
Hey, I know you're only, like,
ten and shit, but listen up.

696
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:31,680
You beat that skanky ass bitch.

697
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:35,082
You beat her hard. I've done all I can do.
It's up to you now.

698
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,618
OK.

699
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:38,490
You're a good girl.

700
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,125
I don't think I want you hanging
out with strippers, OK?

701
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:48,932
OK, if I may have
your attention.

702
00:47:49,932 --> 00:47:52,334
Um, will Laura Pickler

703
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:54,711
and Destiny please come up?

704
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:07,381
Representing Johnson County
in the Iowa State Fair.

705
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:12,293
Mastery in Butter Competition
this year will be...

706
00:48:18,293 --> 00:48:21,679
...Destiny!

707
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:42,049
I guess it was wrong of me to
say that all white people are weird.

708
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,452
That's not true at all.

709
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,421
Actually, white people
are really awesome!

710
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,622
Screw that little Afro girl.

711
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:51,493
- Dad!
- Kaitlen, your mother is upset.

712
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:54,629
What is it, African-Iowan?
It's not my responsibility

713
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,499
to keep up with whatever it is they're
calling themselves these days.

714
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,334
- What?
- She knew she was good all along.

715
00:49:00,335 --> 00:49:03,071
All along, she hustled us.
She's a hustler.

716
00:49:03,072 --> 00:49:07,776
What is your problem? It's just
some stupid contest. God.

717
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:11,747
I cannot wait to get away
from this stupid family.

718
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,614
Really?

719
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:17,352
Maybe I'll just be a stripper,
like Dad's new friend.

720
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,224
Stupid Laura. You know
what you should've said?

721
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:25,761
This is exactly why I stopped
watching American Idol.

722
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,195
Because every year the best
singer gets up there,

723
00:49:28,196 --> 00:49:30,599
and every year she gets knocked
down by some charity case

724
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,103
with a baby and a mug shot.

725
00:49:35,103 --> 00:49:38,506
Well, I'm sorry that I was born
white and tall and pretty.

726
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:43,544
And I'm sorry that I don't sit
in front of the TV all day,

727
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:46,518
eating pork rinds
and just soiling myself.

728
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:51,218
And I'm sorry that I haven't spent
the last 15 years of my life

729
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:54,555
sucking every cock that flew in front of my
face just to put on a cheap church dress

730
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:55,690
and claim to find God.

731
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:57,491
This is so messed up.

732
00:49:57,492 --> 00:49:59,326
I hate my fucking life.

733
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:01,367
Language.

734
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:07,401
To Destiny!

735
00:50:07,402 --> 00:50:10,574
- To Destiny!
- To me!

736
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,651
# She tastes like midnight #

737
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:25,620
# She tastes like wine #

738
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:28,656
# She tastes like midnight #

739
00:50:28,657 --> 00:50:31,326
# She tastes like wine #

740
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:34,129
# I'm gonna run my fingers #

741
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,497
# All down your spine #

742
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:39,301
# Just like a bad dream #

743
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,268
# Staying on my mind #

744
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:45,387
Boyd. Boyd Bolton.

745
00:50:59,387 --> 00:51:01,122
Laura Pickler.

746
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:02,890
Boyd Bolton.

747
00:51:02,891 --> 00:51:05,259
It's been a long time.

748
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,863
Bob wrecked our minivan.

749
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:11,533
Oh, yeah, I see that.
Wow. What did he do?

750
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:15,736
He slammed into something he
shouldn't have slammed into.

751
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:18,272
Well, if you want, we can...

752
00:51:18,273 --> 00:51:21,243
...we can have it fixed for you
right away.

753
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,178
That would be excellent.

754
00:51:26,414 --> 00:51:29,618
- You look great, Laura.
- Oh.

755
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,187
You look even better than you
did in high school.

756
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:37,259
- No.
- Yeah. Most women go the other way, but... Oh, my God.

757
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,730
- Have you had your boobs done?
- They're just cutlets in a friendly bra.

758
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,531
Oh, my God.

759
00:51:43,532 --> 00:51:46,567
- How's your wife?
- Tammy?

760
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:50,638
- She's fine, I guess.
- Great.

761
00:51:55,443 --> 00:51:59,714
# Waiting by the mailbox
by the train #

762
00:51:59,715 --> 00:52:03,752
# Passing by the hills
till I hear the name #

763
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:07,821
# I'm looking for a saw
to cut the chains in half #

764
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:10,759
# And all I want
is someone to rely on #

765
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,861
# As thunder comes a-rolling down #

766
00:52:13,862 --> 00:52:17,499
# Someone to rely on
as lightning comes #

767
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,907
# A-staring in again #

768
00:52:25,907 --> 00:52:28,679
Ohh!

769
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:33,381
Brent and Tammy
Knepp of Rancho Bernardo

770
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:35,383
were about to give up
on swaddling their son.

771
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:37,384
Look at this shit.

772
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:40,856
It keeps babies
from punching themselves.

773
00:52:41,856 --> 00:52:44,426
And don't you think it's weird
that babies can't sleep

774
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,596
without smacking
themselves in the face?

775
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,730
I mean, think about how
fucked up that is.

776
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:52,933
It's like you shouldn't
be able to exist or something

777
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:56,837
if you can't sleep without your arms
flailing around all over the place.

778
00:52:56,838 --> 00:53:01,977
I mean, think about it. Is a baby
better off dead or in the suburbs?

779
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:06,314
In the suburbs you are forced
to live with some stupid family,

780
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:11,285
with stupid people that call you fat
even when you are not fat at all.

781
00:53:11,286 --> 00:53:13,821
and you're forced to deal with
stupid guys like Rob Ackerman,

782
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:16,790
who don't call you back even
when you give them a blowjob

783
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,993
in the back of their Honda.

784
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:21,296
God, I hate people!

785
00:53:21,297 --> 00:53:23,699
I cannot wait until everyone
just dies from global warming.

786
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,472
Right. Do you know
where your dad keeps his money?

787
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,705
Why?

788
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:33,808
Does he owe you money?

789
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:36,310
Like for sex?

790
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,516
He just owes me money.

791
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:42,716
Your hair is so cool.

792
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:45,287
No one at my school
has hair like that.

793
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,955
Thanks. So, the cash would
probably in the...

794
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:50,924
I've never met anyone
like you before.

795
00:53:50,925 --> 00:53:52,826
You're so alternative.

796
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:56,765
...in a drawer or something
like that, in the...?

797
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,570
Maybe.

798
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,770
Hey.

799
00:54:02,771 --> 00:54:05,777
Do you want to play
Truth or Dare?

800
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:11,680
Whoo!

801
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,814
Boyd! Oh!

802
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:15,783
How do you like that, Laura?

803
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:28,802
Oh, my God.

804
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:36,071
No, no, no, no, don't stop.
Don't stop.

805
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:40,075
- I'm sorry, I can't do this.
- No, no, no, I can get you the $600.

806
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,410
Actually, it's $1200.

807
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:48,649
OK. You are so beautiful.

808
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:53,955
You're everything that
I've ever wanted to be.

809
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:56,594
And now you're
right here in my arms.

810
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:02,763
- OK.
- # Gonna spread you like butter #

811
00:55:02,764 --> 00:55:05,500
# Baby on my bread #

812
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:07,801
# Don't want no other #

813
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:10,138
# Girl in my bed #

814
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:12,973
# Gonna spread you
like butter #

815
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:15,542
# Baby on my bread #

816
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:17,745
# I don't want no other #

817
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:21,549
# Girl in my bed
Gonna spread you like... #

818
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:25,486
Are you there, God?
It's me, Boyd Bolton.

819
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:29,823
Oh, wait, there's probably
a lot of Boyd Boltons.

820
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:31,959
Hmm.

821
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,730
OK, so just so you know, I'm
the one that lives in Iowa City.

822
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,437
I don't think there's any other Boyd
Boltons that live in Iowa City,

823
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:46,777
but if there is, I'm the one
who runs Bolton Supercenter.

824
00:55:48,777 --> 00:55:50,944
Yeah, anyway...

825
00:55:50,945 --> 00:55:54,082
...I just wanted to take this
moment to thank you

826
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:57,051
for sending Laura Pickler
to fuck me.

827
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:59,721
I mean, I don't know what you
guys are doing up there,

828
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:02,025
but her pussy is like even tighter
than it was in high school.

829
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:09,467
It's... it's like she hasn't
even used it in 20 years.

830
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:13,170
Anyway...

831
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,007
...I just wanted to say...

832
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:20,210
...thank you.

833
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,615
You're so cool, God.

834
00:56:27,615 --> 00:56:28,716
Amen.

835
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,959
Hello?

836
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,032
Oh, hi, Nancy.

837
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,866
What?!

838
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:49,706
Well, what could possibly be the
problem? She's ten years old.

839
00:56:51,706 --> 00:56:53,508
Right, all right.

840
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:55,617
See you then. Good-bye.

841
00:57:01,617 --> 00:57:03,750
I'm scared.

842
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:07,087
Why are you scared?
You're amazing.

843
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:09,656
Really, it's them that
should be scared.

844
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:12,794
No, I'm scared that you and
Miss Jill won't want me anymore.

845
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:14,764
What?!

846
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:17,064
It's happened before.

847
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:19,608
They just leave me.

848
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:32,947
Did you know that
Jill can't have kids?

849
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:34,982
Why?

850
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:38,953
Well, I mean,
that's complicated.

851
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:40,154
It's...

852
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:42,991
- Is her vagina broken?
- Yes.

853
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:46,160
Yep. That's it.

854
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:52,267
The adoption people would ask
us over and over again...

855
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,903
"Are you sure you
don't want a baby?

856
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,005
We can get you a baby.

857
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,674
You both have good jobs.

858
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:02,576
You have a nice house.

859
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:05,784
We can get you a baby."

860
00:58:09,784 --> 00:58:13,654
But we made up this whole thing
in our heads that, like,

861
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:18,292
we wanted an older child because
they're always overlooked

862
00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:24,204
and we'd be doing so much good for
society and the world and everything.

863
00:58:29,204 --> 00:58:33,643
But the truth is,
we were afraid to have a baby.

864
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:36,081
Why?

865
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:41,186
I don't know.

866
00:58:44,186 --> 00:58:47,788
It's OK to be scared, I guess.

867
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:50,898
Hey, you guys,
they're ready for us now.

868
00:58:56,898 --> 00:58:59,701
Destiny, um, come in.

869
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,935
What's going on?

870
00:59:01,936 --> 00:59:05,839
This is Martin Caswell
from Red Ribbon.

871
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,385
Julie,
send in Mr. Bolton.

872
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:22,199
Oh.

873
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,236
Boyd, would you tell these people,
please, what you told me? Exactly?

874
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:38,105
Oh, yeah.

875
00:59:38,106 --> 00:59:43,076
On the evening of the 15th,
Mr. Ethan approached me,

876
00:59:43,077 --> 00:59:46,279
knowing I have superior skills
in the art of sculpting butter.

877
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,852
And asked if I would help
his daughter, Destiny,

878
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,063
with her sculpture...

879
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:07,035
...with her entry for the Johnson
County Mastery in Butter contest.

880
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,106
I'm sorry, what?

881
01:00:11,106 --> 01:00:12,007
I said no at first.

882
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:18,712
- But after he gave me $500...
- You're kidding!

883
01:00:18,713 --> 01:00:21,214
...I snuck in when
no one was looking

884
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:25,919
and I... I carved
her sculpture for her.

885
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,823
I can no longer live
with this horrible blight...

886
01:00:29,824 --> 01:00:32,929
...on, on, on, on, on...

887
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:37,001
...on my conscience.

888
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:41,803
This is crazy, OK?

889
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,839
I have never met this dude
in my life, I swear to God.

890
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,743
Come on, you people saw her
carve it with your own eyes.

891
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:50,944
I can't even believe
I'm arguing this.

892
01:00:50,945 --> 01:00:52,379
May I make a suggestion?

893
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,417
As it's clear that Destiny's win
is in question, I...

894
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:58,720
Absolutely not.

895
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,122
Destiny won this on her own,
fair and square.

896
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:04,058
I think the only fair solution
would be to have a rematch.

897
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:06,426
Me versus Destiny.

898
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:07,895
At the State Fair.

899
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:10,297
Um, State is this weekend.

900
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:14,368
I mean, I can't possibly get the
proper paperwork prepared in time.

901
01:01:14,369 --> 01:01:17,471
I'm sure someone as smart as you
can figure it out, Nancy.

902
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:19,339
But the coolers.

903
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,176
And then we'd have to haul all
the butter in two days before

904
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:25,046
- so it'll set and...
- Excellent. Great.

905
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:28,982
Well, now that Nancy has
agreed to do her... her job

906
01:01:28,983 --> 01:01:30,917
looks like we've got a rematch.

907
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:33,087
What's wrong with you people?

908
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:36,823
I can't believe you just let this
two-bit trophy wife come in here...

909
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:39,893
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now wait a second.

910
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:42,196
Hey, hey, hey.

911
01:01:42,197 --> 01:01:43,530
- I know.
- She's crazy.

912
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:45,099
This is the kind
of thing that I just...

913
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,035
- Who are you?
- I'll do it.

914
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:49,403
...from over here.

915
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:53,174
- I'll do it.
- Destiny.

916
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:56,477
Eight-hour carve time,
all out in the open,

917
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:58,846
officials present every minute.

918
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:01,281
No verbal contact
with the audience.

919
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,954
No help.

920
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:07,023
And no speeches.

921
01:02:08,023 --> 01:02:09,390
Just butter.

922
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:11,529
- Deal?
- Deal.

923
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,363
Can you believe that bitch?

924
01:02:16,364 --> 01:02:17,864
Jill.

925
01:02:17,865 --> 01:02:20,868
Sorry. You know you
can't say "bitch" right?

926
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:23,171
- I know.
- Just her whole thing.

927
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,239
The hair, the dress, that grin.

928
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,110
Destiny, it's not too late to go back in there
and tell them you don't wanna do this thing.

929
01:02:29,111 --> 01:02:34,247
Are you kidding me? Destiny is gonna
nail that witch. Aren't you, Destiny?

930
01:02:34,248 --> 01:02:36,082
You better believe it.

931
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,951
All right.

932
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:39,155
Let's prep.

933
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:41,922
Laura.

934
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:45,426
Laura!

935
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:48,361
Obviously, I wish you had better
reading skills, but all in all...

936
01:02:48,362 --> 01:02:50,599
She's only ten!

937
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,500
Thank you for your help, Boyd.

938
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:55,937
What, that's it?

939
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,839
That's it?

940
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,374
Hey, hey, where are you going?

941
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:03,410
Come on, don't you remember us?
We were Boyd and Laura.

942
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:07,281
- I give up.
- Boyd.

943
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:11,352
Hey.

944
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:13,855
Imagine if we got
an apartment together.

945
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,156
We could move to Des Moines.

946
01:03:16,157 --> 01:03:19,326
You got the $1200 right?

947
01:03:19,327 --> 01:03:21,596
Or maybe Chicago.

948
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:25,131
Can you imagine how humiliated
my stepmom would be?

949
01:03:25,132 --> 01:03:27,334
She'd probably like, explode.

950
01:03:27,335 --> 01:03:29,139
I think you're late
for practice.

951
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,406
I could be with you forever.

952
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:34,975
Yeah.

953
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:38,879
- About that. The money?
- Oh.

954
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,915
I can't wait to see
how this plays out.

955
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:44,517
Good luck.

956
01:03:44,518 --> 01:03:45,953
Call me.

957
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:47,622
Yeah, definitely will.

958
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:51,400
I was only kidding about
the moving in together stuff.

959
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,301
Move it, bitches!

960
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:06,274
Whoo!

961
01:04:14,315 --> 01:04:16,417
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

962
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:20,187
Let's go for a ride.
I got something to show you.

963
01:04:20,188 --> 01:04:22,622
OK.

964
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:24,125
What'd you learn
in school today?

965
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,259
Positive and negative numbers.

966
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,398
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

967
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:31,065
See that store over there?

968
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,633
Mm-hm.

969
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:35,069
With this $1200
I could buy work clothes

970
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,041
like you have never seen.

971
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,045
Where do you work?

972
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,485
Barnes & Noble.

973
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:53,154
So I want you
to look over there.

974
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:59,125
And I want you to see very clearly
that I am willing to sacrifice $1200

975
01:04:59,126 --> 01:05:03,196
worth of totally cute outfits so
that you can have these knives.

976
01:05:03,197 --> 01:05:05,759
And with these knives,
you carve the best damn

977
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,102
butter sculpture this
world has ever seen.

978
01:05:08,103 --> 01:05:10,136
You must not fail, Destiny.

979
01:05:10,137 --> 01:05:14,274
You can do this.
You can take down Laura Pickler.

980
01:05:14,275 --> 01:05:17,012
You kick her pasty,
white ass so hard,

981
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:21,181
so that she and her stupid
husband can never wreak havoc

982
01:05:21,182 --> 01:05:24,118
on poor, innocent people
like me ever again.

983
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:26,123
We cool?

984
01:05:28,123 --> 01:05:29,256
Thank you.

985
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:49,642
Well, we don't know for sure, but
nine times out of ten in these cases,

986
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:52,346
we suspect drugs and...

987
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:53,647
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

988
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:55,582
Hi, Destiny.

989
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,718
You know...

990
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:02,422
..I think it would be best if we had
this discussion alone, just grownups.

991
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:04,396
Uh... No, no, she can stay.

992
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,199
OK.

993
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:16,407
- From what we can surmise, on the night of...
- Um...

994
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:22,576
Destiny, your mother
was a wonderful woman

995
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:25,815
who fell on hard times.

996
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:30,683
She was not capable
of taking care of you,

997
01:06:30,684 --> 01:06:34,500
but she loved you
very much nonetheless.

998
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,472
We found this.

999
01:06:51,472 --> 01:06:53,710
She's pretty.

1000
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:58,645
Hi, Mom. It's me,
Destiny. Your daughter.

1001
01:06:58,646 --> 01:07:01,714
We probably haven't seen each
other since I was a baby.

1002
01:07:01,715 --> 01:07:03,716
I don't remember you at all.

1003
01:07:03,717 --> 01:07:07,555
But now that the lady gave me
your picture, I wish I did.

1004
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:11,125
I don't know what you were
doing all these years,

1005
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:12,760
but now that
you've gone to heaven

1006
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:15,830
I just want you to know
I forgive you for leaving me.

1007
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:21,134
I don't really understand it that
much, but I still forgive you.

1008
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:23,313
OK. Bye.

1009
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:45,496
Motherfucker!

1010
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,664
Hi, Bob.

1011
01:07:50,664 --> 01:07:55,335
Come on. Come on in, just
standing there like Rain Man.

1012
01:07:55,336 --> 01:07:57,820
Hey.

1013
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:14,921
Um... I don't think
this is gonna work.

1014
01:08:14,922 --> 01:08:19,460
Laura, you're gonna need an
armature for something that grand.

1015
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:22,763
Then I'll build an armature.

1016
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:25,502
I'm not afraid
of hard work, Bob.

1017
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:29,737
Not that it matters
anymore anyway.

1018
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,404
What do you mean?

1019
01:08:31,405 --> 01:08:34,175
Well, you saw
what I did back there.

1020
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:41,314
My sculpture was twice as good as your
"Schindler's List" and you know it.

1021
01:08:41,315 --> 01:08:44,751
My cooler was 43 degrees, the
eye-forehead-ratio was perfect.

1022
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:47,621
Yeah. You had all that down.

1023
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:50,559
I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually kinda
surprised at how technically good you are.

1024
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,695
- You think, Bob?
- Yeah.

1025
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:57,632
But you also need
to inject some soul into it.

1026
01:08:58,632 --> 01:09:00,768
I'm just saying...

1027
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:02,472
...not everyone can be
an artist.

1028
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:07,212
You don't think
I can be an artist?

1029
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:13,613
Look, I know what it is
I'm dealing with here.

1030
01:09:13,614 --> 01:09:15,782
I am gonna have to give
these so-called judges

1031
01:09:15,783 --> 01:09:21,388
the statement piece
that they're looking for.

1032
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:25,593
And when they see what I have planned for
them, their jaws are gonna hit the floor.

1033
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,328
And you are gonna
be right there,

1034
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:30,531
next to my cooler,

1035
01:09:30,532 --> 01:09:35,838
cheering me on as dutifully
as I have you the last 15 years.

1036
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:42,876
Good morning,
folks. You're listening to

1037
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:46,279
KQWK broadcasting live

1038
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,849
from Des Moines
at the Iowa State Fair.

1039
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:51,585
It's 103 degrees out
on the fairgrounds,

1040
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:53,953
but even hotter
in the Grand Hall

1041
01:09:53,954 --> 01:09:59,492
where crowds are squeezing in for
the highly anticipated rematch.

1042
01:09:59,493 --> 01:10:03,467
Laura Pickler versus Destiny.

1043
01:10:11,805 --> 01:10:13,876
# Pump it up #

1044
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,510
# Get out yo seats #

1045
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:18,546
# Pump it up #

1046
01:10:19,546 --> 01:10:21,653
# You gotta move your feet #

1047
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,457
# In the disco #

1048
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:30,858
# I wanna see #

1049
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,327
# I wanna see you celebrate #

1050
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:35,461
# Celebrate, celebrate #

1051
01:10:35,462 --> 01:10:37,430
# And let yourself go #

1052
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:39,366
# Fly away, fly away #

1053
01:10:39,367 --> 01:10:42,368
# Fly away and
let your love go #

1054
01:10:42,369 --> 01:10:44,638
# Hello, good-bye #

1055
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:46,675
# I'm gonna meet you
on the other side #

1056
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:49,710
# Oh, yeah All right #

1057
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:51,778
# Go crazy #

1058
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:54,555
# Celebrate #

1059
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:02,322
Hi, how are you?

1060
01:11:10,097 --> 01:11:12,599
# Fly away and
let your love go #

1061
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,002
# Hello, good-bye #

1062
01:11:15,002 --> 01:11:17,737
# Gonna meet you
on the other side #

1063
01:11:17,738 --> 01:11:20,107
# Oh, yeah All right #

1064
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:22,076
# Go crazy #

1065
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:57,978
# Are you livin' are you livin'
Can't keep cool #

1066
01:11:57,979 --> 01:12:02,416
Five, four, three,

1067
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:04,020
two, one!

1068
01:12:08,456 --> 01:12:10,556
Trowels down!

1069
01:12:44,192 --> 01:12:46,193
She's outdone herself.

1070
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:49,030
- Oh, my! JFK!
- Thank you all for coming.

1071
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:53,166
Please come back tomorrow
after church

1072
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:57,136
when the judges will be viewing
these two interesting pieces

1073
01:12:57,137 --> 01:13:00,541
for the very first time
and will announce the winner

1074
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:05,490
of the Johnson County Mastery
in Butter competition again.

1075
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:51,191
Dear God, it's me.

1076
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:53,727
I just want you to know,
Laura doesn't know about this.

1077
01:13:53,728 --> 01:13:56,796
So don't blame her. Oh, hang
on, you already know that.

1078
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:59,077
Man,
you're awesome. Amen.

1079
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:32,970
What the hell?

1080
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:39,840
I'll see what's going on, OK?

1081
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:43,277
Excuse me.
What happened?

1082
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:45,245
Um, we don't know.

1083
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:48,215
But she's gonna get a chance
to fix it, right?

1084
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:51,785
Well, um, the judges have
already begun deliberation.

1085
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:53,986
And the rules indicate that no
further adjustment can be made

1086
01:14:53,987 --> 01:14:55,024
once deliberation commences.

1087
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,890
Come on, lady.

1088
01:14:57,891 --> 01:15:01,632
My name is Nancy
and those are the rules.

1089
01:15:05,632 --> 01:15:07,269
You know what?

1090
01:15:08,269 --> 01:15:12,305
You people are ridiculous.

1091
01:15:12,306 --> 01:15:14,107
I mean, it's butter.

1092
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:16,242
You put it on toast.

1093
01:15:16,243 --> 01:15:20,346
Right? The government
gives it away for free.

1094
01:15:20,347 --> 01:15:23,884
Oh, oh, oh! And newsflash!

1095
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:25,952
It's bad for you!

1096
01:15:25,953 --> 01:15:28,822
Yeah, I said it out loud.

1097
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:32,091
It clogs your arteries
and it makes you fat.

1098
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:34,728
And you're all gonna
die because of it!

1099
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:36,596
What?
Really?

1100
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:39,166
The butter police? Wow!

1101
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:42,836
We've got it. We've got it under
control. We've got it.

1102
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:45,141
Destiny, we'll be right back.

1103
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:50,844
So now what?

1104
01:15:50,845 --> 01:15:53,293
I've lost, that's what.

1105
01:16:42,963 --> 01:16:45,972
I'd just like to say good luck.

1106
01:16:51,972 --> 01:16:55,682
You know, this is all I have.

1107
01:17:01,682 --> 01:17:05,452
You're still young and you have
your whole life ahead of you

1108
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:11,895
and you can,
you can do anything.

1109
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,728
And you're so beautiful.

1110
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:18,732
And I know you...

1111
01:17:18,733 --> 01:17:21,470
Well, I know you don't
understand this...

1112
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:26,926
...but this is all I have.

1113
01:17:45,926 --> 01:17:48,894
This is unbelievable.

1114
01:17:48,895 --> 01:17:52,933
For the first time I can remember
the midway is completely deserted

1115
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:56,469
as everyone gathers to witness
a little piece of history.

1116
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:59,939
Thousands packed the Grand Hall
to see these two contestants'

1117
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:02,010
daring and radical
butter sculptures.

1118
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:06,145
Now it's up to our judges
to decide once and for all

1119
01:18:06,146 --> 01:18:09,416
who will represent Johnson
County here at State.

1120
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:12,818
Stay tuned to KQWK
for the live results

1121
01:18:12,819 --> 01:18:16,268
and your favorite
light hits and less talk.

1122
01:18:27,268 --> 01:18:29,136
May I have your
attention, please?

1123
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:34,174
The judges have reached
a decision. Orval?

1124
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:36,242
Thank you, Nancy. Um...

1125
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:39,446
In my years judging
this competition, uh,

1126
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:41,046
I've seen many things.

1127
01:18:41,047 --> 01:18:45,050
But only twice
have I seen true art.

1128
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:50,857
The first was Bob Pickler's
brilliant "Passion of The Christ"

1129
01:18:50,858 --> 01:18:54,528
with Neil Diamond as Jesus.

1130
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:58,465
- And the second this morning...
- Did he say Neil Diamond?

1131
01:18:58,466 --> 01:19:03,804
...when I laid eyes on a work
so tragic, so touching,

1132
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:09,408
that it became not just butter
carving, but butter art.

1133
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:15,247
And to be touched yourself, you
merely have to look right here...

1134
01:19:15,248 --> 01:19:17,917
...at the sad, melted face

1135
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:20,420
of this unloved child.

1136
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:23,908
Our winner, again, is Destiny.

1137
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:43,953
Can you put me down, please?

1138
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,385
I'd just like to say

1139
01:19:53,386 --> 01:19:56,360
this isn't all you have.

1140
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,516
Aww!

1141
01:20:44,971 --> 01:20:48,274
You won't believe this,
but somehow my messed-up sculpture

1142
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:51,077
won the State competition
that year.

1143
01:20:51,078 --> 01:20:55,581
The Des Moines Register called
it "an angst-ridden exploration

1144
01:20:55,582 --> 01:20:58,285
- of post-natal abandonment."
- Congratulations.

1145
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:02,988
I told them it was just a sculpture
of my mom, but whatever.

1146
01:21:02,989 --> 01:21:07,193
I was just happy that I finally
found something I was good at.

1147
01:21:07,194 --> 01:21:08,960
I also got
a postcard from Brooke.

1148
01:21:08,961 --> 01:21:10,997
She wrote to say that
she was doing great

1149
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:14,300
and was promoted to general
manager of Barnes & Noble.

1150
01:21:14,301 --> 01:21:18,404
And then, some even cooler
stuff started to happen.

1151
01:21:18,405 --> 01:21:22,442
Firstly, Jill finally figured
out how to do my hair.

1152
01:21:22,443 --> 01:21:24,944
Destiny, come on down.

1153
01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:27,647
You get to hear Ethan attempt
to sing Christmas carols.

1154
01:21:27,648 --> 01:21:30,383
- It's really awful.
- She means awesome.

1155
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:32,085
OK, I'll be down in a minute.

1156
01:21:32,086 --> 01:21:33,020
Yes! You won't regret it.

1157
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:37,090
# God rest ye merry gentlemen #

1158
01:21:37,091 --> 01:21:40,727
# Let nothing you dismay #

1159
01:21:40,728 --> 01:21:45,264
Oh, and also Miss Jill and
Mr. Ethan officially adopted me.

1160
01:21:45,265 --> 01:21:50,403
Which meant that was the last time I
had to unpack that stupid suitcase.

1161
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:53,371
And you've probably heard

1162
01:21:53,372 --> 01:21:55,609
that Mrs. Pickler is
running for Governor.

1163
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:58,411
The word on the street is
that the big man himself

1164
01:21:58,412 --> 01:22:01,313
came to her in a vision
and told her to run.

1165
01:22:01,314 --> 01:22:03,383
Sounds kinda messed up to me.

1166
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:07,389
But a lot of people seem to
really like what she stands for.

1167
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:10,623
Mr. Ethan says it's
because she panders

1168
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:13,193
to the lowest common
something-or-other.

1169
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:17,697
But I think people actually
kinda like her.

1170
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:21,300
Still, if there's even the
slightest chance she'll win,

1171
01:22:21,301 --> 01:22:24,636
I'm fixing to team up
with some bad-ass ninjas

1172
01:22:24,637 --> 01:22:29,608
to march down to Des Moines
and kick her butt.

1173
01:22:29,609 --> 01:22:31,586
"Keep Marchin'"

1174
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:40,421
Mark!

1175
01:22:41,421 --> 01:22:44,523
Excuse me. Let me just
try that again.

1176
01:22:44,524 --> 01:22:47,559
My father raped me.

1177
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,562
Oops!

1178
01:22:49,563 --> 01:22:52,165
What if the whole place
is a vacuum?

1179
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:53,599
And you turn inside-out?

1180
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,635
And your internal organs
implode?

1181
01:22:55,636 --> 01:22:59,406
- You had your boobs done?
- Thanks for noticing.

1182
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,640
They look great.

1183
01:23:03,476 --> 01:23:05,678
You are so warm and minty.

1184
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,613
Ooh!

1185
01:23:07,614 --> 01:23:10,250
There could be
a Miley Cyrus concert.

1186
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:13,685
There could be a Justin Bieber
concert ready to break out.

1187
01:23:13,686 --> 01:23:16,055
Bob, I saw your penis.

1188
01:23:16,056 --> 01:23:17,791
Don't look at me.

1189
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,626
My name is Kenneth.
I'm Bob's brother.

1190
01:23:20,627 --> 01:23:22,530
But I will definitely...

1191
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,831
Bob, I'm gonna shit
on your lawn.

1192
01:23:25,832 --> 01:23:28,233
I can't, I can't say it. Ahh!

1193
01:23:28,234 --> 01:23:30,469
What if this place
is full of piranhas?

1194
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:31,838
That have learned how to walk?

1195
01:23:31,839 --> 01:23:34,808
Could be full of vegetarians.

1196
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:37,777
Bob, I'm gonna
shit on your lawn.

1197
01:23:37,778 --> 01:23:41,751
- Yeah. Mm.
- That's disgusting.

1198
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,751
You're disgusting.

1199
01:23:45,752 --> 01:23:48,254
You can take down Laura Pickler.

1200
01:23:48,255 --> 01:23:53,760
You can take down that pasty,
white ass and make... Sorry.

1201
01:23:53,761 --> 01:23:56,429
Not "take down that ass." No.

1202
01:23:56,430 --> 01:24:00,341
Hey, look...
Sweet baby Jesus.

1203
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:11,344
It could be a Republican
party fundraiser.

1204
01:24:11,345 --> 01:24:14,480
You tell Orval
that this isn't over.

1205
01:24:14,481 --> 01:24:16,648
It's just not, right?

1206
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:18,751
Move it, bitches!

1207
01:24:18,752 --> 01:24:21,321
- Oops!
- Cut!

1208
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:24,359
"Butter (The Greatest Gift In Life)"

01:24:57,658 --> 01:25:01,161
