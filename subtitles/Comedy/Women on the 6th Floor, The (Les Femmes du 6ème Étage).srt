1
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,640
APRIL 1944
BOURG-EN-BRESSE STATION, FRANCE

2
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,390
Search the warehouses!

3
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,430
Spotlight!

4
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,910
Bring him here!

5
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,040
I'll deal with him.

6
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,730
A sniper! That window up there!

7
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,720
FEMALE AGENTS

8
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,720
In 1940, Winston Churchill
created a new kind of secret service,

9
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,940
the Special Operations Executive,
better known as the SOE.

10
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,570
One section was responsible
for overseeing operations in France.

11
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,030
In 1941, a new head was appointed,
Colonel Maurice Buckmaster.

12
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,620
In 1944, the SOE's "French Section"

13
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,120
was dedicated, at a heavy human cost,

14
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,200
to ensuring the success of D-Day.

15
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,420
SATURDAY 27th MAY, 1944
TEMPSFORD AIRFIELD, ENGLAND

16
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,420
I heard about your husband.

17
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm sorry.

18
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,930
Claude was shot 40 days ago.
l intend to fight on.

19
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,220
With or without your blessing.

20
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,810
How did you find me, Louise?

21
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,820
A liaison officer told me he'd trained
with a Desfontaines in London.

22
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,530
I thought nothing of it.

23
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,570
I was sure you'd given up.

24
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,950
That I was like Father...

25
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,910
saying, "The war's over, let's just capitulate."

26
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,370
And blindly follow Pétain? Yes.

27
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,210
I was sure of it.

28
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,920
That you'd bailed.

29
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,210
Actually, by going to London,

30
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,800
you found the best way to fight on

31
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,760
and get away from Claude and I.

32
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,350
I never got what you saw in him.

33
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,270
Not to mention he was a communist.

34
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,160
SOE HQ, LONDON
COLONEL BUCKMASTER'S SECTION

35
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,370
How long did you work as a nurse
in Bourg-en-Bresse?

36
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I never really stopped.

37
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,170
Would you care to go back to it?

38
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm not here to heal casualties.

39
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,970
You'd be evacuating one.
From a German hospital in Normandy.

40
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,850
A German casualty?

41
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,850
A Brit disguised as one, actually.

42
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,060
What is this madness?

43
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,560
Probably what the poor fellow said
when he saw what had happened.

44
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,860
The "poor fellow" is a geologist.

45
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,490
On a mission for us,

46
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,240
he was spotted by a German in Normandy.

47
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,870
Our man shot him and stole his uniform.

48
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,040
- That's pretty cheeky.
- Stupid, you mean.

49
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,540
He was in Lisieux when
the Royal Air Force bombed it.

50
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,090
So he became a German casualty.

51
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,760
And was sent to a Wehrmacht hospital
in Pont-l'Evêque.

52
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,220
Why was he in Normandy?

53
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,220
That's just what the Nazis
must never find out.

54
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,890
You think I can get him out all on my own,

55
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,480
dressed as a nurse?

56
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,270
Not all on your own.

57
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,020
There'll be five of you.

58
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,320
Five women under Pierre's command.

59
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,490
<i>Your brother devised the whole mission.</i>

60
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,900
<i>We already have one agent in place.</i>

61
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,370
<i>An ltalian from Milan's Jewish aristocracy.</i>

62
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,620
How are you?

63
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,040
<i>Her codename is Maria.
She'll liaise with you.</i>

64
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,250
<i>She's already made contact
with the geologist.</i>

65
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,420
To complete the unit,
here are some potential recruits.

66
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,630
Some have already done
a commando course.

67
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,550
How long do we have to train?

68
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,510
A one-day refresher course,
then you fly straight out.

69
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,890
That's insane!

70
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,440
Have you heard of Colonel Heindrich?

71
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,190
No.

72
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,940
He was with the Abwehr,
counter-espionage,

73
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,900
and he just joined the SS's intelligence unit.

74
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,320
He must be on the geologist's tail.

75
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,560
These were taken by one of our spies
on the English coast.

76
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,980
What are those strange objects
in the harbour, Colonel?

77
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,030
They look like floating grain silos.

78
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,030
Grain silos protected by ack-ack guns?

79
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:07,160
I believe these blocks play a role
in landing the enemy's invasion forces.

80
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,790
Colonel Heindrich,

81
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,960
why have we concentrated the majority
of our units around Calais?

82
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,920
The Allied fleet can unload troops
and equipment faster in an existing port.

83
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,880
And don't forget,

84
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,010
it's the shortest route
between the English and French coasts.

85
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,970
I'm sorry to insist, Field Marshal,

86
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,690
but what if it's all a diversion?

87
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,400
What if the landings
took place somewhere else?

88
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,360
Such as, Colonel?

89
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,950
Across from Southampton, in Normandy,

90
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,410
on one of the beaches.

91
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,500
Where we spotted an English geologist.

92
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,590
Compass, readings, samples...
In his panic, he left all this behind.

93
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,090
I'm sure he hasn't made it back
to England yet.

94
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,970
The thing about you SS people

95
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:10,350
that most amuses me
is that you never have any doubts.

96
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,230
Colonel, do you seriously believe

97
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,440
I will move all my Panzer divisions
because of a phantom geologist?

98
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,620
Colonel, if I may say so,

99
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,040
you see the world with different eyes.

100
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,630
The Field Marshal's Prussian.

101
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,090
As far as I know, we're not fighting Prussia.

102
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,630
Talk to someone
who has access to the Führer.

103
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,260
Who? Rommel?

104
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
He'd listen to you.

105
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,760
He could get you a hearing in Berlin.

106
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,150
First, let's find the English geologist.

107
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,440
Without him, I've no hope.

108
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,490
SUNDAY 28th MAY, 1944
HOLLOWAY PRISON, LONDON

109
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,740
A stay of execution
by order of the Lord Chancellor.

110
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,660
lt's not a mistake?
I killed a man, remember.

111
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,790
Your pimp? I don't call that a man.

112
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,000
Nobody forced me into anything.

113
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,880
Stop being silly.
If not for us, you'd have been hanged.

114
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,800
That's your only alternative
to our proposition.

115
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,510
I knew there'd be a catch. What is this?

116
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,930
We need you for a mission in France.

117
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,140
Who do I have to fuck? Pétain?

118
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,860
We are reliably informed
that you used to perform nude in Soho.

119
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,690
You need a girl who'll get her leg over,
so here l am?

120
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,740
You must be desperate.

121
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,370
We also need a girl who can kill.

122
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,870
What do I get out of all this?

123
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,830
What are you thinking?

124
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,710
That you can refuse?

125
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,340
I'm not the type who works for nothing.
Thanks anyway.

126
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,350
You'll die like a whore
who never had a chance.

127
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,850
Is that what you want?

128
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,150
If the mission's a success,
you'll be pardoned.

129
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,490
I'm sure she's the right choice.

130
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,320
We can't trust her, she's a nutcase.

131
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,660
A rope round her neck and she said no.
That takes a hell of a nerve.

132
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,370
When the next one finally arrives,
let me do the talking.

133
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,000
What are you doing?

134
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,130
I'd hate to cramp your style.

135
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,940
l'm Gaëlle Lemenech.
We have an appointment?

136
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm Louise. Please, sit down.

137
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,520
Sorry I'm late.
The General often keeps us back.

138
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,190
Hello, Hoe.

139
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,820
Hi, Pick.

140
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,570
- Still owe me a drink.
- Tomorrow?

141
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,580
"Hoe"?

142
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,450
Yes, it's a tradition in our unit.

143
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,120
They give us the names of tools.

144
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,840
They wanted to call me Saw but I refused.

145
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,960
"Eye-Saw!"
You see my point, don't you?

146
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,050
Besides explosives,
what do you do for De Gaulle?

147
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,720
Do you ever go on missions?

148
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,600
Never. It's my only regret.

149
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,270
Thanks.

150
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,440
Making bombs without blowing them up
is frustrating.

151
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,610
You can vent your frustrations
with me in France.

152
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,330
Sorry, but I can't.

153
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,290
I work for De Gaulle, not Churchill.

154
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,470
If you don't mind me saying,
you're in with that officer.

155
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,680
Sorry?

156
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,300
The lieutenant.
He can't take his eyes off you.

157
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,890
If I were you, I wouldn't think twice.

158
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,480
Who knows? Tomorrow, we may be dead.

159
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,370
You realise what you're asking?

160
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,200
Explosives expert and trained commando.
If you can do better...

161
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,580
It's humiliating.

162
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
You weren't always so picky.

163
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,470
- Well?
- She'll do it.

164
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,470
Was it hard?

165
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,270
The scouts, the cancelled wedding,
the fiancé sent to work in Germany...

166
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,190
Listening to that all night was tough, yes.

167
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,070
Is it true the Gestapo tortured you last year?

168
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,490
Yes.

169
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,700
Why go back?

170
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,830
What are you trying to prove?

171
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,040
I'm not trying to prove anything.

172
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,270
MONDAY 29th MAY, 1944
FANY HQ, LONDON

173
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,690
You're sure it's for me?

174
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,200
Who told you I love Paris-Brests?

175
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,370
We talked to your parents in Orléans.

176
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,960
Apparently, they bake wonderful cakes.

177
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,460
Their only daughter runs off to Paris.
That must really hurt.

178
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,380
Especially when she flees to London
under an assumed identity.

179
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,260
Mademoiselle Suzy Desprès.

180
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,600
Very pretty, Liliane.

181
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,980
I wonder if that doesn't suit you more.

182
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,650
We know you were
the mistress of a Nazi officer

183
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,860
when you danced
at the Folies-Bergères in Paris.

184
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,280
And here we have the banns for a wedding...

185
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,330
due to take place on 14th October, '41,

186
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,250
at the church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

187
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,790
Curiously, the ceremony never took place.

188
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,050
Why?

189
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,510
Stand up. Remove that uniform.

190
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,980
You're unworthy of it.

191
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,940
Leave this one to me.

192
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,280
Why not come for me before, if you knew?

193
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,030
Because we need you now.

194
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,870
For my secretarial skills?

195
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,490
No, dancing back home. For a good cause.

196
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,450
I'll never go back to France.

197
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,870
It's that or a court martial. Choose!

198
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,420
l put my past behind me.
I broke off the engagement.

199
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,460
If you want to put it behind you,
l have the solution.

200
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,600
TUESDAY 30th MAY, 1944
TEMPSFORD AIRFIELD

201
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,160
For unforeseen expenses.

202
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,210
How much is in there?

203
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,550
And these are your travel permits
and ration books.

204
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,810
You must each learn
your new identity by heart.

205
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,560
It's very important.

206
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,350
Raymonde? Do I look like a Raymonde?

207
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,690
Funny name for a music-hall artiste.

208
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,280
If the Gestapo arrest you,
you hold out for 48 hours.

209
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,360
- 48 hours?
- Long enough for the others to reach safety.

210
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,280
What if they torture us?

211
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,450
Detach yourselves from reality.

212
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,750
Always remember, talking too soon
can cost people their lives.

213
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,170
As a last resort, you have this.

214
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,050
- Cyanide?
- Yes.

215
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,760
lf ever you need it, bite on it.
The poison acts in five minutes.

216
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,390
And farewell, Raymonde!

217
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,940
- Have you ever been blessed?
- Never.

218
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,610
If I get on my knees, it's not to pray.

219
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,740
Your brother's a sweetie,
but l'm not stupid.

220
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,120
Did you ask him to chat me up?

221
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,330
Careful what you say.

222
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,040
Actually, I'm glad.

223
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,130
I was bored and underpaid with De Gaulle.

224
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,570
- You lost this.
- It doesn't matter.

225
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,490
l'd never use it.
It's against my religion.

226
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,330
God doesn't care
what goes on down here.

227
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,330
You say that because of your husband?

228
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,800
My brother was shot on his 20th birthday.

229
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,260
But I never lost my faith.

230
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,600
<i>Field Marshal Pétain, head of state,
will address you now.</i>

231
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,600
<i>French people,
don't make our situation worse</i>

232
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,400
<i>by resorting to acts
that give rise to tragic reprisals.</i>

233
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,360
<i>lt will be innocents in the French
population who suffer the consequences.</i>

234
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,740
<i>Don't listen to those
who try to exploit our distress.</i>

235
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,870
<i>They will lead the country to disaster.</i>

236
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,340
<i>France will save herself by observing
the highest standards of discipline.</i>

237
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,590
<i>Obey, therefore,
the orders of the government.</i>

238
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,720
Colonel? She's waiting at the bar.

239
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,440
It wasn't easy, but I've found you a little gem.

240
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,940
My dear Eddy, if it was easy,
l'd find her myself.

241
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,570
Colonel, I have something to ask you...

242
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,150
Not your export business again?

243
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,910
If you help me, you'll triple your income.

244
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,080
Triple my income?

245
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,250
You think that interests me?

246
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,460
NIGHT OF 31 st MAY, 1944
NORMANDY COAST

247
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,250
Stop praying!
You'll bring us bad luck!

248
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,500
Leave me alone.
l do what l want.

249
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,820
Nurse!

250
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,570
Come quickly!

251
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,950
Everybody, prepare to jump!

252
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,830
Suzy, clip yourself on. Hurry!

253
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,790
Check your gear.

254
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,380
Number four, OK!

255
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,720
Number three, OK!

256
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,430
Number two, OK!

257
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,890
Number one, OK!

258
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,090
THURSDAY 1st JUNE, 1944
HOTEL REGlNA, PARlS

259
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,300
Colonel, I got a call from
the military hospital in Pont-l'Evêque.

260
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,140
I'm waiting for confirmation,

261
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,270
but we may have our geologist.

262
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,400
ROAD TO PONT-L'EVÊQUE, NORMANDY

263
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,660
Your permits, please.

264
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,170
Who's she? I don't know her.

265
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,000
She's new. Replacing Lucienne.

266
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,110
Your papers, please!

267
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,580
- We're here for the show.
- Go right ahead.

268
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,330
Find the Englishman
and I'll catch up with you.

269
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,330
What are you going to do?

270
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,050
I need a word with my brother.

271
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Nobody gets out until I say so.

272
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,510
There's a problem.
Suzy's ex just arrived.

273
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,850
- Are you sure?
- Positive. The one In the photo.

274
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,020
We can't let him take the geologist
or see Suzy.

275
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,320
The SS-man she was to marry,
was it Heindrich?

276
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,240
What are you keeping from me?

277
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,370
Get back to Maria.
That's an order.

278
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,870
Come on, everybody out.

279
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,170
Careful, girls, you're being watched.

280
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,290
- They transferred him upstairs.
- Shit!

281
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,550
Come on!

282
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,130
I'll get a stretcher.

283
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,010
I'll wait here.

284
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,530
In 30 seconds, you're on.

285
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,120
A word of advice.
Don't look, you may get a shock!

286
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,760
- The patient needs treatment.
- Nobody enters.

287
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,640
- Colonel's orders.
- Get off!

288
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,930
- l won't allow this, Colonel!
- What are you talking about?

289
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,150
The man you're beating.
It's a hospital, not an abattoir.

290
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,530
You are forbidden to enter that room.

291
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,030
Understood?

292
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,940
What are you doing there? Get out!

293
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,530
Finished?

294
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
I won't be long.

295
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,310
Excuse me, can I make a call to Paris?

296
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,410
Encore! Encore!

297
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,960
Louise! The show's ended.

298
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,260
Let's go!

299
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,190
Hurry up!

300
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,420
Open the windows!

301
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,810
Jeanne!

302
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,810
Come on!

303
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,110
Cover them, with me! Come here!

304
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,910
Open up! Back a bit more!

305
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,140
20 seconds!

306
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Ten seconds!

307
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,490
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

308
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,180
Tell the Wehrmacht
to sweep the whole area!

309
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,970
l can't, Colonel.
The radio room's been blown up.

310
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,940
This is Colonel Karl Heindrich.
Put me through to Wehrmacht HQ in...

311
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,150
- Colonel...
- Wait!

312
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,530
..Wehrmacht HQ in Pont-l'Evêque.
l need reinforcements! What?

313
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,450
One of the soldiers took photos of the show.

314
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
What?

315
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,170
Well done, ladies.

316
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,800
You did a good job.

317
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,390
When the war's over,

318
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,060
I'll light a candle in church for you.

319
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,560
You may think it's stupid,

320
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,850
but promise me you'll do the same.

321
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,070
You too, Louise.

322
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,080
I'll never go back into a church.

323
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,540
And candles are for the dead,
not the living.

324
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,420
Maria, have you got a pencil?

325
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,660
<i>Colonel, an English aircraft
was spotted over the coast.</i>

326
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,420
Message received.

327
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,630
Is there a spot nearby
where a plane could land?

328
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,810
- Bernard, René, get the fires lit.
- OK.

329
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,690
Stay in the ambulance.

330
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,810
Louise, we need to talk.

331
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,240
- We're heading for Paris.
- What's Phoenix mean?

332
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,660
- I can't tell you.
- Or about Heindrich either?

333
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,250
lf he'd seen Suzy,
we'd all be dead by now.

334
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,670
Why did you lie to me?
Don't you trust me any more?

335
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,420
- You haven't changed.
- Wait...

336
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,340
- We can still eliminate Heindrich in Paris.
- Paris?

337
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,390
It's crawling with collaborators.
It's too dangerous. With Suzy?

338
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,720
She's our best chance.
It's why we chose her.

339
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,350
You want to use her as bait?

340
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,310
That's your Plan B?

341
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,150
She won't have the nerve.
She'd rather kill herself.

342
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,730
The girls did their jobs.

343
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,030
They were chosen for a single mission.
I gave my word.

344
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,410
Let them go.
We'll find a way without them.

345
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,660
Maria, René and I drive to Paris tonight.

346
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:43,080
Bernard knows a safe house.
You'll join us tomorrow.

347
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,590
We'll meet at the Institute for the Blind
at Duroc.

348
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,880
The director is with us.

349
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,470
They'll be risking their lives, you realise?

350
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,390
Every day, agents die
accomplishing their missions.

351
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,270
You'd never have done this to men.

352
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,710
Girls, here comes our taxi to Buckingham!

353
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,820
The mission's not over.
We must be in Paris tomorrow.

354
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,570
Paris? Is he insane?

355
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,160
Nobody said anything about Paris.

356
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,160
We had a deal. I respected my side of it.

357
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,030
You gave me your word.

358
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,160
I'm going back.

359
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,920
We're all going to Paris. No exceptions.

360
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,170
Go on, fire!

361
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,960
Jeanne, not now. We have to obey orders.

362
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,340
You're a bunch of shits!

363
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,550
Hurry back to the safe house.

364
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,080
Stop! Get your hands in the air! Don't move!

365
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,930
Cease firing!

366
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,520
No, don't. I'll go.

367
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,520
I want him alive. Aim for his legs!

368
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,200
Grab him, quickly!

369
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,040
Get his pill!

370
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,980
Move it out!

371
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,990
Don't.

372
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,210
Is the mission confirmed?

373
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,970
You spend the night here.

374
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,970
Bernard will take me to Lisieux.

375
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,970
I'm going ahead to Paris.

376
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,890
Sleep in the cellar tonight,
just to be on the safe side.

377
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,270
I'm really sorry about your brother.

378
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:51,540
A freezing cellar and rotten apples
when we have millions in cash.

379
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,960
What better time to spend our cash?

380
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,550
How can you think of money now?

381
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,670
It's the way I am.

382
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,930
I'm a whore, not a choirboy. Never forget it.

383
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,140
You're used to humiliation. I'm not!

384
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,770
- I refuse to crawl to the Germans!
- Let go of me!

385
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,100
If we're ordered to Paris,
we don't argue, OK?

386
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,400
Stuff your orders!
I'm not a spy or a resistance hero.

387
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,940
Find some professionals.

388
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,400
Pierre's been arrested. René's dead.

389
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,610
It's our duty to take their place.

390
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,110
Our duty?

391
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,950
As soon as the war's over,
we'll be whores and slaves again.

392
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,200
I'm not dying for the French flag.

393
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,210
In fact, I'll take my share
and be gone tomorrow.

394
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,670
Anybody touches the money...

395
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,510
Stop!

396
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,800
Hurry, it's light already.

397
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:24,490
We did our best, Colonel,
but the negative was partly damaged.

398
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,700
Only this one is of any use.

399
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,240
- Have you had it enlarged?
- Naturally.

400
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,090
FRlDAY, 2nd JUNE, 1944
GESTAPO HQ, AVENUE FOCH, PARIS

401
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:20,500
Shaky handwriting. A wounded man, maybe.
I found it in your pocket.

402
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,340
The geologist wrote it, didn't he?

403
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,090
I have no idea.
I don't know who you're talking about.

404
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,680
And I've no idea who you are, Mr SOE.

405
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,230
But given your nerve,
you can't be just anybody.

406
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:45,360
And if you're not just anybody,
you must know what Phoenix refers to.

407
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,990
What are these blocks for?

408
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,370
Is it to do with the landings?

409
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,540
I've no idea.

410
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,290
Continue.

411
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,940
- Who do you think you are?
- Don't play hard to get.

412
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,610
Call me a slut, why don't you?

413
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:38,410
Leave my friend alone
or I'll call the Germans.

414
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,590
Coffee, ladies?

415
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,250
No, thank you.

416
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,590
Miss, is something wrong?

417
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,260
A doctor! Find a doctor!

418
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,650
Louise fainted in the restaurant car.

419
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,400
Why didn't you help her?

420
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,950
You're joking! It's packed with Germans.

421
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,660
Come on, we're going back.

422
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,750
- That's not yours.
- It's a friend's. We're looking for her.

423
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,500
She's in that compartment. She fainted.

424
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,670
A doctor's examining her.

425
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,150
Your blood pressure's low.

426
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,360
You need to eat something.

427
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,240
- Are you a doctor?
- I wouldn't have examined you otherwise.

428
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,330
When was your last period?

429
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,540
Some time before the war.

430
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,500
It must be all these people.
I couldn't breathe.

431
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,880
I feel much better now.

432
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,800
Congratulations to the mother...

433
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,050
and father.

434
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,810
You didn't know?

435
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,390
- What about Louise?
- She's with a German doctor.

436
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,230
Shit! Where's Jeanne?

437
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:31,400
She was right behind me.

438
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,030
Did she have the suitcase?

439
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,400
Yes.

440
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,490
Stay here. Don't move!

441
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,710
Louise is with a Kraut.
We're fucked. Come with me.

442
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:52,040
- Running won't win over your mum.
- Or save my dad from Verdun.

443
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:53,960
Don't get preachy with me.

444
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,340
What's that?

445
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,430
"Thou shalt not kill"?

446
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,680
Who's getting preachy now?

447
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:11,060
All aboard! We'll soon be on our way.

448
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,010
Louise, it's Suzy. Open the door.

449
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,300
Are you OK? Do you need help?

450
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,470
I'm fine. Tired, that's all.

451
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,570
Colonel...

452
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,490
Look at this one!

453
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,120
A definite resemblance.

454
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:15,290
Eddy, l'll have to transmit your file
to your Gestapo friends on Rue Lauriston.

455
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,050
Her lookalike's
under a stone somewhere, but it takes time.

456
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,390
Time is running out.
For you and for me.

457
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,860
Look where you're going!

458
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,940
Sorry, I was miles away.

459
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,860
- Are you OK? Are you hurt?
- lt's nothing.

460
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,530
Perhaps I could buy you a drink.

461
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,460
SAINT-LAZARE STATION, PARIS

462
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,520
Be at the Institute for the Blind in one hour.

463
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,230
Make sure no one follows you.

464
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:22,940
Or else, tomorrow noon at Concorde,
on the Pont de Neuilly platform.

465
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,410
Now, let's split up.

466
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,000
- May I?
- Thank you, doctor.

467
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,460
- This is my friend, Suzy.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

468
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,210
Follow me.

469
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,340
The ladies are with me.

470
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,230
Goodbye, miss.

471
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:10,700
Officer, all the way from Lisieux,
that fellow with a moustache

472
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,740
couldn't keep his hands to himself.

473
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,250
Fine, we'll have a word with him.

474
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,770
Go through, miss.

475
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,360
Please come with me.

476
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,000
- And our prisoner?
- Still nothing.

477
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,540
We've got to make him talk.

478
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,840
I need something to persuade Rommel.

479
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,720
Colonel, these photos
are from the SS archives.

480
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,890
They're close to the woman you described.

481
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,780
Louise Desfontaines.

482
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,540
That's her. I'm sure of it.

483
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,550
I'm late. The postman overslept.

484
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,850
Hurry, they're waiting for you.

485
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,200
Your rooms will soon be ready.

486
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,870
We were worried. Any problems?

487
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,920
I got lost a few streets away.

488
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,960
- Gaëlle isn't here?
- Not yet. I left her at the checkpoint.

489
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,050
- Why are you all dressed up?
- I wish I knew.

490
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,840
But apparently it's top secret.

491
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,970
- l'm taking her out.
- Promise me, no Germans.

492
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:42,140
- l promise.
- Can we talk?

493
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,270
Not now, we're in a hurry.

494
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,070
All right. In that case, Suzy stays here.

495
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,990
Come on, then.

496
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,040
This Eddy guy, can we rely on him?

497
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:09,090
l made sure he'd arrange
for Suzy to meet her colonel.

498
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,760
Help me.

499
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,810
Where do you plan their reunion?

500
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,890
Where they fell in love.
Room 813, at the Regina.

501
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,820
- Who'll pull the trigger?
- Suzy.

502
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,360
The gun will be in the room.

503
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,950
Suzy kill Heindrich?
Forget it, she wouldn't hurt a fly.

504
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,910
You'll have to convince her, then.

505
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,180
For the last time, where is this woman?

506
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,550
I don't know.

507
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,680
I've never seen her before.

508
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,180
I find that hard to believe.

509
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:10,020
Our men picked this one up
at Saint-Lazare an hour ago.

510
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,480
Off the Lisieux train.

511
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,320
Introductions are unnecessary.

512
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,230
You may be indifferent to your own pain,

513
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,820
but perhaps not to that of your friend.

514
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:03,450
Stop! Enough.

515
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,710
Where are your accomplices hiding?

516
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,210
And the Phoenixes? What are they for?

517
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,590
The Duroc Institute for the Blind.

518
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:02,390
We were to meet there
to await orders for a new mission.

519
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,320
Tell me what I'm supposed to do, at least.

520
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,690
You'll see.

521
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,110
Look, don't treat me like an idiot.

522
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:22,820
Let's go.

523
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,990
Slow down.

524
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,000
Walk normally.

525
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,010
Open the door! Hurry up!

526
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:42,430
In the Metro, I sat next to a Jerry.

527
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:45,680
His holster was open
and he hadn't even noticed.

528
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,180
But nothing happened.

529
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,140
What should have happened?

530
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:52,560
Nothing.

531
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,560
But it gives you ideas.

532
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,480
We should kill all the Krauts.

533
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,290
We've got to go. Help me with the case.

534
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:24,180
- What about Gaëlle?
- We've no time.

535
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,180
What do you want?

536
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,180
You have no right!

537
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,560
This is an educational institution
for children!

538
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,150
Find the director.

539
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,790
Children, stand to one side.

540
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,630
Keep to the walls!

541
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,890
We've searched all over and found nothing.

542
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,730
Search again!

543
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,450
Left at the bottom. Towards the sewers.

544
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,960
Check the wardrobe!

545
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,090
Weapons! Call the colonel!

546
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,140
Did your brother know where we were?

547
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,060
He didn't give us away.

548
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,230
Somebody must have done.

549
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,230
If not him, Gaëlle.

550
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,610
If ever I run into her again...

551
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,280
Director...

552
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,120
what do you teach your pupils exactly?

553
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:17,790
Where is Louise Desfontaines?

554
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,210
I know nobody of that name.

555
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,860
Your cyanide pill?

556
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,070
I'm scared.

557
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,700
You don't know what that means.

558
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,670
Come closer.

559
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,710
Come on.

560
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,350
Let go of her!

561
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,580
Recruiting women so young.

562
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:43,790
I'm disappointed in Buckmaster.

563
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,560
I'm going to need your services again.

564
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,730
Your friends got away from me.

565
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,610
Where and when was the back-up?

566
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,280
The back-up?

567
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,400
Don't act dumb,
I know the SOE's methods.

568
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,910
Louise knows now that I betrayed them.

569
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,200
She won't come to the rendezvous.

570
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,840
She's a woman who likes to take risks.

571
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,140
If I talk, what's in it for me?

572
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,230
Your freedom.

573
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,150
To be tried and sentenced by the SOE?

574
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,360
You prefer that we torture you?

575
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,630
Tomorrow noon. Concorde Metro.
Pont de Neuilly platform.

576
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,650
Champagne?

577
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,320
Thanks.

578
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,110
- Thank you.
- Fabulous!

579
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,370
Thanks to you, I'll be back
in the colonel's good books.

580
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,790
- What colonel?
- The one I'll introduce you to tomorrow.

581
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,830
Hold on, I'll show you.

582
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:56,880
Here, look.

583
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,680
Honest, you're the spitting image
of his floozy.

584
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,680
You're heaven-sent.

585
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:06,850
- Are you expecting someone?
- No, nobody.

586
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,060
Tell me what's going on.

587
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,690
Where'd he get this?

588
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:19,610
Ladies, what can I do for you?

589
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:22,120
Sorry to disturb you.
We're friends of Maria and Suzy's.

590
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,830
- Her cousin. I need to talk to Maria.
- Come on in.

591
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:29,040
My friends' friends are my friends!
Pretty ones, especially.

592
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,250
It won't take a second.

593
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,920
It's a beautiful apartment you have.
Congratulations.

594
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,420
They raided the Institute.

595
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:38,970
I know. We saw the Germans arriving.

596
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:41,340
You want to get me in Heindrich's bed?

597
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,430
That's your mission?

598
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:45,770
You made a real fool of me!

599
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,430
You're all scum!

600
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,640
You, Pierre, Buck and the whole SOE!

601
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:54,230
The SOE?
What's your cousin talking about?

602
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,610
I'll never see Heindrich again.
I'd rather die right now.

603
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,780
You'll only get me in his room if I'm dead.

604
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,620
- Easy!
- That's my shroud!

605
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,080
What's got into her?
What's all that about Heindrich?

606
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:13,670
We'll stay here now. Help me tie him up.

607
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:18,590
I'll warn Buck about the Institute.

608
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:26,600
Stop! Calm down, Suzy.

609
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,970
You can't force me to see him again.

610
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,390
- Nobody can.
- All this over a guy. And a Nazi!

611
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,650
l didn't sleep with a Nazi. l fell in love
with a German. It's not the same thing.

612
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:39,780
Stop! Listen...

613
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,820
The only thing we want
is for you to meet him.

614
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:45,160
A moment, a brief moment.

615
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,830
Jeanne and I will take care of the rest.

616
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:51,160
You can't let us down now. We need you.

617
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:53,250
We need you.

618
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,340
It'll be fine.

619
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,260
It'll be fine.

620
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,300
We were to get married
in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

621
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:53,520
- He bought me a wonderful dress.
- And you got him a Nazi uniform?

622
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,730
He joined the Hitler Youth
to get into officer training school.

623
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,570
Don't make excuses for him.

624
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,820
A Nazi or a Resistance fighter,
it's the same to me.

625
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:04,700
No, it's...

626
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,160
It was marriage that repulsed me.

627
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,870
Belonging to a man.

628
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:12,040
It's as simple as that.

629
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,330
It doesn't matter.

630
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,880
You did the right thing,
if not for the right reasons.

631
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:24,050
He never knew I was pregnant.

632
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,050
You've got a kid?

633
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,300
I wouldn't be a good mother.

634
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,930
You got rid of it?

635
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,440
You gave it up?

636
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,530
A family in Liverpool.

637
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:48,280
No more Nazi dad and collaborator mum.

638
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:53,160
For him, the slate's clean.

639
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,430
No answer from London?

640
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:13,810
No.

641
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:18,100
We have seven minutes
before he has to stop transmitting.

642
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,400
- Do you want a coffee while we wait?
- A real one?

643
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,400
100% black market.

644
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,110
Suzy's cut up about what she did.

645
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,490
Why? Maybe she'd have been
a terrible mother.

646
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,500
How can you say that?

647
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,500
Except dying,
nothing worse can happen to a kid.

648
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,290
There's always worse.

649
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,420
Pity isn't your strong point.

650
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,300
Try to be a little bit human for once.

651
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:54,390
ln the train,
I found out I'm three months pregnant.

652
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,890
I can't be more human.

653
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:04,610
My husband and I
had been trying for kids for years.

654
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,030
London's come through!

655
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:11,160
And?

656
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:16,700
Buckmaster
asks you to make contact tomorrow

657
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,830
with a certain Melchior.

658
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:28,840
SATURDAY 3RD JUNE, 1944
NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, PARIS

659
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,100
The elephant has a broken tusk.

660
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,610
Louise?

661
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:49,650
Follow me.

662
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,120
The operation's planned for noon
on the platform at Concorde.

663
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,750
Gaëlle gave us away.
Why does Buck want her back?

664
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:05,580
He's sure Heindrich will be there.

665
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,130
You will execute him.

666
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,460
In the Metro? In public?

667
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:10,920
It's safer than the Regina.

668
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,550
You don't trust Suzy any more?

669
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,340
Only to lure him in.

670
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:18,640
For the rest, Buck prefers to rely on you.

671
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,560
In the Metro, some of the staff will help.

672
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,390
They're part of our network.

673
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:42,200
To carry it. Is that OK?

674
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,960
What about my brother? Any news?

675
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,710
He's still alive.

676
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,710
Any hope of him escaping?

677
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:56,300
Buck doesn't want you
to endanger the operation.

678
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:59,100
I always see my missions
through to the end,

679
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,350
but I won't let my brother
be beheaded as a spy.

680
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,460
Jeanne?

681
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:33,260
You bastard,
you stole a Jewish family's place.

682
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,260
- I didn't steal it, it was empty.
- What a creep!

683
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:39,640
- I had connections, that's all.
- I'm going to kill him.

684
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,520
- Not yet, we still need him.
- Me? What for?

685
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,730
The Allied offensive, heard of it?

686
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,480
A lot of hot air and no action.

687
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,360
Funny guy!
Soon there'll be no Boches in Paris.

688
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:56,030
If I lend you a hand, you'll tell the Brits?

689
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:59,410
Start with the Germans,
end the war with the Brits.

690
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,950
- How French can you get?
- And if I refuse?

691
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,040
My whole family was sent to the camps.

692
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,000
You know what that means?

693
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,880
If you refuse to help us,

694
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,710
it'll be my pleasure to kill you.

695
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,590
OK, that's settled.

696
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,340
I'm your man.

697
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:35,000
On the platform,
if there's trouble, sit tight.

698
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:27,550
There's three of them.
Two with Gaëlle, one by the steps.

699
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,140
- And Heindrich?
- Don't know, no sign of him.

700
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,930
The train will wait three minutes.
We need to know.

701
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:34,350
Yes, I haven't forgotten.

702
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,980
Are you OK?

703
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:40,190
I'm fine, I'm not ill.

704
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,280
I just wish I were in your shoes.

705
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,690
Excuse me, do you have a light?

706
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,700
Thank you.

707
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,750
In the office.

708
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:07,610
OFFICE

709
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

710
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:16,290
there's been an incident
at the Champs-Elysées station.

711
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:19,000
I'm waiting for the green light to go.

712
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,300
Liliane!

713
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,950
Louise, it's a trap! Run!

714
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,550
Block the exits!

715
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,340
Check everybody's papers!

716
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:58,720
Stop the train that just left.

717
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,770
Between two stations? Impossible!

718
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,230
Do it. Do it!

719
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,770
Thanks.

720
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:13,280
Too late. It's arrived at Tuileries.

721
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,160
Check that woman's papers.

722
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,790
Papers!

723
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,880
But why?

724
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:36,930
Over there!

725
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,670
Take her away.

726
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,140
Louise, please.

727
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,350
Help me.

728
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:49,520
Louise. Do you forgive me?

729
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:52,650
Louise, please.

730
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:55,610
Say you forgive me.

731
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:48,910
Answer it, Eddy. Hurry up!

732
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:57,300
What were you doing in the Metro?

733
01:24:58,210 --> 01:25:00,380
<i>Hello, Colonel.</i>

734
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:02,380
Answer me, Eddy. Quickly.

735
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:06,220
Sorry, I have to catch my breath.
lt was a close one.

736
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,310
<i>l nearly caught a bullet.</i>

737
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,230
Who was with you?

738
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,900
What do you mean?

739
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:18,110
I saw you on the platform at Concorde.

740
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:21,690
Who was the woman who got on with you?

741
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:25,160
You were there?
You're not hurt, are you?

742
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,740
Stop playing the fool and answer me!

743
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:34,420
Actually, l was meeting
someone I think you'll like.

744
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:38,000
She looks so much like her.
Her twin sister, almost.

745
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,920
Where is she?

746
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,220
She's not with me now.

747
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:49,220
She was passing through Paris
and she leaves later today.

748
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,230
<i>Are you still there?</i>

749
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:54,440
Yes, Colonel, I'm listening.

750
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,730
<i>Find her and bring her to the Regina
at six o'clock this evening.</i>

751
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:03,530
Did you hear me?
It's your last chance, Eddy.

752
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:05,450
Your last chance.

753
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:09,280
We have to leave, fast.

754
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,370
Not until we complete the mission.

755
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:13,910
She's right. We can't back out now.

756
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,670
Take me to him.

757
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:33,980
Louise Desfontaines,
Granville's widow.

758
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:38,730
Sister of Lieutenant Pierre Desfontaines
of the SOE,

759
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,480
arrested by the Gestapo
last year in Le Mans.

760
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:46,610
How moving to see a family reunited!

761
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:56,000
Why have you tried to kill me twice, Louise?

762
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,600
Why was the geologist so important to you?

763
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:16,230
What did his message mean?

764
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:43,130
As an only son,

765
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:46,630
I thought a brother and sister's love
was the strongest.

766
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,090
I wish I had a sister like Louise.

767
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,890
I'd hate to have a brother like you.

768
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:57,080
I spoke to Rommel's secretary.

769
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,500
The Field Marshal
travels to Ulm tomorrow.

770
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,830
He can see you in Berlin before he leaves.

771
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,920
I need something to tell him.

772
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,850
She can't take much more.
You can still save her.

773
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:25,810
If I talk, do I have your word she'll live?

774
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,730
I give you my word.

775
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:30,360
I want your word as an officer.

776
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,570
Stop!

777
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:03,060
I beg your forgiveness.

778
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:17,200
Louder!

779
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,530
Speak up.

780
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:23,290
The cubes...

781
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:25,540
will be towed by tugboats.

782
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,920
How can stone blocks cross the Channel?

783
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:32,590
They float.

784
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:37,010
What? You mean they're hollow?

785
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:42,520
When they reach the coast,

786
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,520
they'll be filled with water

787
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,560
so they sink near the beaches.

788
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:53,110
Why?

789
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,950
To build a floating port
with pontoons between them.

790
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:07,330
An artificial port allows the Americans
to land anywhere in Normandy.

791
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:10,670
After the failed landing in Dieppe, it's...

792
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,170
your last chance to invade.

793
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:24,180
Get to the Regina fast.

794
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:28,350
Call Rommel. I'll take the night train
and be in Berlin early tomorrow.

795
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,730
Colonel, with respect...

796
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:35,150
Without proof, you won't convince him.

797
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,400
You should take the prisoner.

798
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,240
Good idea. Organise it.

799
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,490
Quickly!

800
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:53,750
I'll keep my promise.

801
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,170
Your sister's life will be spared.

802
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:01,340
Untie them and give them some water. Now.

803
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,280
This is Lieutenant Becker of the SS.

804
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,360
Put me through
to Field Marshal Rommel's office.

805
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,570
Yes, I'll hold.

806
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:39,760
Melchior speaking.

807
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:25,800
Delighted to see you again.

808
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:27,220
Antoine.

809
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:30,390
Room 813.

810
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,600
Follow me, miss.

811
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,110
Open your bag.

812
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:44,410
That's good, go ahead.

813
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:29,490
Is something wrong, miss?

814
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:31,580
Everything's fine, thank you.

815
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:15,060
Liliane...

816
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,810
For three years,
I refused to believe you were dead.

817
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:24,770
Why did you leave?

818
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:30,610
Our love was doomed.

819
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,490
Give us another chance.

820
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:38,410
Come with me.
I'm leaving for Germany tonight.

821
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:49,670
Did Buckmaster send you?

822
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:52,220
You're one of his agents?

823
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,100
Don't let them sully
the beauty of what we had.

824
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,650
Quickly! Upstairs!

825
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,970
Hold on.

826
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:24,180
How did it go? Where's Suzy?

827
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:26,810
I don't know. Hold on.

828
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,040
- Give me your gun.
- What for?

829
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,580
The mission's to kill him.

830
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,960
You're mad. Not here!

831
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:09,150
Who's this?

832
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:10,730
A friend of Louise's.

833
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,860
Buckmaster sent me.

834
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,780
Drive!

835
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:51,980
You should never...

836
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,900
have used her!

837
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,910
You will be transferred
to La Roquette prison.

838
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:05,040
I'm taking your brother to Germany with me.

839
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,420
It's probably the last time
you will see each other.

840
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:14,170
Take him away!

841
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:34,020
A doctor! Fast!

842
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:52,210
The only thing I can do for you

843
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:55,960
is to commute your death sentence
to deportation.

844
01:40:57,050 --> 01:40:59,880
- What do you choose?
- Execution.

845
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:05,050
I'll make the arrangements.
Take him away!

846
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,710
Do you need help?

847
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:52,560
Hold your fire or I'll kill her!

848
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,790
What about Gaëlle?

849
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:31,720
EVENING OF 3rd JUNE, 1944

GARE DE L'EST STATION, PARIS

852
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:54,680
l'll create a diversion.
Don't worry about me.

853
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:23,500
Let me through.
I have a document for Colonel Heindrich.

854
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:25,170
Go ahead.

855
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:37,470
Colonel Heindrich!

856
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,390
I've just spoken to Churchill.

857
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,610
He insists on congratulating
you and Jeanne personally.

858
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:33,160
For that, Jeanne must be here.

859
01:45:35,570 --> 01:45:39,830
I rely on you to bring her home, personally.

860
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:35,880

APRlL1945
MILITARY HOSPITAL, LONDON

862
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:23,270
Can I have a word?

863
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:27,440
Come in my office.

864
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:38,110
These photos were taken by the Russians

865
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:41,200
after the liberation of Ravensbrück.

866
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:45,120
If, by any chance, you recognise
Jeanne among these women...

867
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:42,510
I'd like to be alone.

868
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:07,040
8th MAY, 1945

869
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:46,240
In 1949, Louise returned to France
and married an architect.

870
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:49,990
She was awarded the Croix de Guerre
and Légion d'Honneur.

871
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:54,870
She died in 2004
at the age of 98, childless.

872
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:08,840
This film is dedicated to the women
who fought against Nazi barbarity.
