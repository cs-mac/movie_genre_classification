1
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:06,126
My mother could be rich.
She could be rich and smart.

2
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:10,959
Or she could be rich and stupid.

3
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:14,564
On the other hand, she could be
just poor and good-hearted.

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:18,404
Or she could be poor and mean.

5
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:22,448
I mean, I-I have no idea
what she's like. It's--

6
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,238
And there's my father, right?
I look at guys on the street every day--

7
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,321
regular guys
walking down the street.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,288
And depending on my mood, I imagine
that any one of them could be my father.

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,930
This guy.
How about this guy?

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,365
Hi, Dad.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,639
Then I have to picture
these two people having sex.

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,244
Okay, maybe they're not together now.
But at least 30 years ago...

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,084
they had to hook up
in order to have me, right?

14
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:49,244
Mix and match, mix and match,
all these people together.

15
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:51,322
I can't help feeling...

16
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:54,483
that if I'd been raised
by at least one of my real parents...

17
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:57,529
I wouldn't be
such a nervous person, you know?

18
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:02,003
I might be living a completely different
life in a totally different city.

19
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:04,970
I could be married to a totally
different person with a different job.

20
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:08,124
I mean, how do I know? I don't.
Anything's possible.

21
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:15,164
Well, the mystery of your
unknown self is about to unfold.

22
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:18,325
Your mother lives
in San Diego, California.

23
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:24,402
Her name is Valerie Swaney.

24
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:27,604
Valerie Swaney?

25
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:30,332
I told you it wouldn't take long.

26
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:32,370
Can we arrange a meeting soon?

27
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:34,445
How's, um--
How's next month?

28
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:38,129
No, no. I told Nancy I'd do it sooner.
I-I've been driving her crazy.

29
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:40,125
Because you can't name your son?

30
00:01:40,214 --> 00:01:43,251
I've just been distracted and tense
ever since the baby was born.

31
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:46,007
- A little unsteady?
- Preoccupied.

32
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,927
I heard a song 'bout
clouds and rainbows

33
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:12,214
I hum a tune
that sings like a dove

34
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:16,812
Found some words about anything

35
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:21,175
Anything but love

36
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:25,045
I paint a picture of my prison

37
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:30,006
With blue and grey
for the skies above

38
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:34,376
Framed and signed with a title

39
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:38,451
Anything but love

40
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:42,929
He had to go
but I won't miss him

41
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:47,250
I have got
better things to do

42
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:51,651
Like writing stories
and painting pictures

43
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,175
Of anything but love

44
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,451
Oh, anything but love

45
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:04,452
Anything but love

46
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,249
Nancy?

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,291
I'm in the bedroom!

48
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,259
Big news.
I got big news.

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,491
Hi, sweetie. You look great.
Why are you dressed like that?

50
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,539
Did you forget about our date?

51
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,454
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,374
- No. It's okay, you're here now.
- No, no, no. I feel so bad.

53
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,497
We're not gonna fight about it.

54
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:35,175
Look at you.
You look so sexy.

55
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:39,257
But I want to tell you
what I forgot.

56
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:42,061
- Take your shoes off.
- No, no, wait, wait. We have to talk.

57
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:44,053
- We have to talk. Talk.
- No. No. Honey, no talking.

58
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,417
No, no, we have to talk
about wh-why I'm late.

59
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:49,778
- Control freak, huh?
- No. Yeah, maybe I am a control freak.
- Control freak.

60
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,773
Don't!

61
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:03,419
- Nap time's over.
- Nap time's over.

62
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,812
Wait, wait. I'll get him.
I'll get him.

63
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:09,100
You don't have to put your pants on
to get the baby.

64
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,661
Honey, do you think
we're ever gonna have sex?

65
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:19,974
Definitely.

66
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:25,657
There, buddy, Yeah.
How ya doin'?

67
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:28,703
It's okay. Yeah, yeah.
You okay?

68
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,504
- We'll be out in one second.
- Oh.

69
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,462
I feel like I'm keeping you
from something.

70
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:35,695
No. No, no, no.
This is a priority.

71
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:38,697
Is this a bad time for your wife?
'Cause, you know, I could come back.

72
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:41,664
Not at all. We just need
a couple of minutes.

73
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:45,304
This is crazy.

74
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:48,458
I mean, all right, I feel guilty
'cause I missed the date.

75
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:52,300
I just gotta tell her. What am I
afraid of, right? This is stupid.

76
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:57,504
- Hey, here you go.
- No, no. This is good.

77
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,101
- What?
- This is good. You stay with Daddy.

78
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:03,543
- Keep his hands occupied.
- Oh, Nancy. Nancy. No, no, no.

79
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:07,302
Honey. Honey.
Can't we make another date, please?

80
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:11,778
Thi-- Sweetie, this is--
Sweetie, he's looking right down at you.

81
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:15,577
This isn't-- Oh. Oh, no, no. No.

82
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:18,102
No. Oh, no, no, no.

83
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:22,187
My real mother lives in San Diego.

84
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:24,259
- What?
- That's what I was trying to tell you.

85
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:26,657
I went to the adoption agency,
and they found my real mother.

86
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,660
Just like that?
You walked in, they found her?

87
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:30,660
Well, it was the second
trip, actually.

88
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,944
- Ohh.
- I know, I know.

89
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,940
- Honey.
- I know. So listen...

90
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:37,497
why don't you put something on
and come over and say hello to Tina.

91
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:41,059
- Who?
- The woman who helped
arrange everything.

92
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,822
This woman's in our apartment
right now? She's here?

93
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,788
Yeah. Well I-- You know,
I-I was trying to tell you before...

94
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,145
but you got all sexed up
and everything--

95
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,461
Well, I got sexed up
because we had a date, not because
I'm some kind of freak or something.

96
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,506
- I didn't say you were a freak.
Did I say you were a freak, honey?
- No.

97
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,388
- No, no. Come on, this is good, right?
- Hi. I'm Tina Kalb.

98
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,461
I'm sorry to burst in on you
like this...

99
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,826
but Mel said he didn't
want to waste any time.

100
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,550
That's all right. Nancy understands
how important this whole thing is.

101
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,350
- Great. The baby's gorgeous,
by the way. It looks just like Mel.
- Ohh.

102
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:10,503
Thanks. Really? You really think so?
Everybody always says he looks like me.

103
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:14,345
Well, what do I know?
I'm just another 30-year-old woman
desperate for a baby of her own.

104
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:16,548
Your husband
doesn't want to have kids?

105
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,623
Yeah, I'm in the middle
of a divorce, actually.

106
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,385
I just can't seem
to part with the ring.

107
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:25,306
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. You know, it was
one of those death marriages--

108
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:27,952
you know, the kind where you
have to start making dates to have sex.

109
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:33,746
Well, I'm sure it'll work out. I mean,
I'm sure you'll meet somebody else...

110
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,983
and you'll be happy
and you'll fall in love again...

111
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:38,792
- and things'll just be wonderful.
- Yeah, I don't know.

112
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,784
I think it might be easier
at this point...

113
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:43,182
just to find an intelligent man
to impregnate me.

114
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:47,625
I'm sorry. I don't understand
exactly who you are.

115
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,864
Oh, didn't I tell you?
She's-She's doing the study.

116
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:52,422
I'm gonna be coming along
to San Diego next week...

117
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:54,425
to document the reunion.

118
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,312
In fact, Nancy, I've got
some waivers that I need you to sign.

119
00:06:57,394 --> 00:07:00,511
You see, there's such a dearth
of in-depth documentation...

120
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:03,392
into the psychological impact
that these reunions have...

121
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:07,388
on, for instance, you, the spouse,
as well as Mel's adoptive family.

122
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:09,830
- Ah, so you're a psychologist?
- Not quite.

123
00:07:09,915 --> 00:07:12,190
I'm just finishing my doctorate.

124
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,425
Tina used to be a dancer.

125
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:18,394
Oh, those days are long gone. I--
Listen, I've gotta call the office.

126
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:21,627
Oh, there's a phone in the kitchen.
It's right there on your left.

127
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:24,184
- Got one right here.
- Well, next week?

128
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,789
- Yeah, yeah.
- God, that's soon.

129
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,232
Well, they're gonna pay for everything.
Isn't that great, sweetie? Honey?

130
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:35,876
After I had my baby,
I wanted my husband to stay home...

131
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,868
and help with night feedings...

132
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,551
not drag me on some plane
for San Diego.

133
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:43,674
I like travelling.
The baby's five months old.

134
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,430
I really think this is gonna get us
closer together.

135
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:51,193
Oh, honey, after you're married,
he feels like he's kissing his mother
half the time, anyway.

136
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:56,113
Our kissing is still nice, but he's
so controlling about the oral sex.

137
00:07:56,198 --> 00:07:58,507
Well, have you tried
the warm water method?

138
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:00,589
- Are you kidding?
- No.
- You're kidding.

139
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:02,794
- No.Joe loves it.
- Hey.

140
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:04,869
- Oh, hi, Mel.
- Hi.
- Look what I found.

141
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,869
What did you find?

142
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,475
- What made you dig these out?
- Remember?

143
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,868
I don't know. I was just feeling
nostalgic for some reason.

144
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,952
That's so sweet. We found these
on our first field trip together.

145
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,827
Very sweet. Oh, congratulations
on finding your mother, Mel.

146
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,151
- Thank you.
- That oughta settle
some big issues for you, huh?

147
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,470
Definitely. Which issues
are you talking about?

148
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,997
- Starting with the whole sex thing.
- Sex. Baby's name. The baby's name.

149
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,435
- 'Cause you said Ethan--
- No, no, wait a minute.
She just said the sex thing.

150
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,670
- You said that Ethan was too feminine.
- Right.

151
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,036
- We were trying to think of a more
masculine baby name, right? So--
- Okay, but she said the sex thing.

152
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:41,351
- Didn't you just say the sex thing?
- But she meant that.

153
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:44,001
- Well, why don't you just let her
speak for herself? Wh-What did you mean?
- Well, tell him. Tell him. Go on.

154
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,800
Actually, it was oral sex
I was referring to.

155
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,111
Oral sex, really?
I think I just walked in...

156
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:51,556
- on a ladies' conversation
that guys aren't supposed to--
- No, you didn't.

157
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,950
- Yes, I-- I'm gonna go.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'm gonna leave.
- No, stay.

158
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,795
- No. No. Leave.
- Don't go. Come on.
- Go. Stay? No.

159
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:59,191
- Honey, we weren't talking about us.
- I-- What?

160
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:01,193
- We wouldn't-- I wouldn't--
- No. I know.
- You've gotta know that.

161
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:04,001
- I know that so much.
- Bye.
- So true.

162
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,596
Hey, I didn't go around telling my
friends you didn't want to make love...

163
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,957
for almost two months
after the baby was born, did I?

164
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:12,558
- Probably.
- Okay, but it didn't
get back to you, did it? Huh?

165
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:17,993
Are you sure you're okay
about this woman coming along?
It's not weird or anything?

166
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,996
Well, it's a little strange
to be travelling with a chaperone.

167
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:26,476
But if you're okay with it,
I'm okay with it.

168
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:31,194
Well, it's just, she's been through
the process so many times.
I think it's a good thing.

169
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:35,516
Honey, if this helps you
get what you need inside...

170
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:38,402
- then I'm all for it.
- Thanks, sweetie.

171
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:43,398
This cheese is disgusting.
Get it away from me.

172
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,521
- What's wrong with this cheese?
- It smells like vomit.

173
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,563
- Oh, stop being such a baby.
- Mom, Dad, this is Tina.
- I'm a baby who smells like vomit?

174
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:51,637
- Yes.
- You okay?
- Nancy, did you get
that support bra yet?

175
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,876
- Not yet.
- What are you waiting for?
- Hey, I want to introduce you
to somebody.

176
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:57,320
Please don't make
such a big deal out of it.

177
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:00,478
- It makes a real difference.
- All right, could we not talk
about this right now?

178
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:04,718
Uh, yes, we're gonna talk about this
because she's not listening to me.

179
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:07,798
- I want you to see something.
- Ohh.
- Very nice, Pearl.
- For God's sake.

180
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:11,925
- I want you to consider my age
and ask yourself how I maintain this.
- Mom, why are you doing this?

181
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:14,999
- How? I don't know. How?
- This is it. All right, can we
not deal with this right now, please?
- I couldn't have a baby.

182
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:17,078
But I had to fight the laws
of gravity just the same...

183
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:19,681
and you need the help
of a good bra.

184
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:23,123
And believe you me, if you want
to keep your husband's attention,
you'll get one pronto.

185
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,005
You know, if my breasts drop, they drop,
and there's nothing I can do about that.

186
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:28,043
- Wrong!
- That's right. Good for you, honey.

187
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,562
- Wrong!
-Just back off, will ya?
- You've had five of these.

188
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:32,684
- I don't think--
- Don't monitor me.

189
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:36,238
- Your new friend is, uh,
very long-waisted, isn't she?
- Okay, that's it!

190
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:38,967
- We're not talking
about this any more, okay?
- It's a free country.

191
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:41,516
- Why can't I talk?
- Let him alone.

192
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,042
You're making an ass
out of yourself again!

193
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:47,963
- Why don't you leave me alone!
Why don't you just have a little sniff?
- Don't do that. Hey, hey.

194
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:50,882
- The baby's crying.
- Get that away from me,
or I'll smack it off.

195
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:53,529
- Yeah, you're gonna beat me up
in front of all these people?
- Don't tempt me!

196
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:56,442
Would you stop acting like this?
That's it! All right?

197
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,681
- Don't yell in front of the baby.
- Don't yell in front of the baby.
It's not good.

198
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,079
Well, he wouldn't have to yell
if you'd listen to him for two seconds!

199
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,287
Well, what's gotten into my sweet
daughter-in-law all of a sudden?

200
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,487
- Hormones. No mystery there.
- Does this baby have a name yet?

201
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,004
- Four months old, doesn't have a name.
- Well, don't blame me.

202
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,479
- I like the name Ethan.
- Oh, no, no. Ethan's too lame.

203
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,201
- Everything's too lame, too bold.
- This is becoming an embarrassing,
neurotic thing, Mel.

204
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,328
It's not an embarrassing, neurotic
thing. This is about my real identity.

205
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,766
- It's about my background, okay?
- Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,887
You're Mel Coplin.
That's who you are.

207
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:30,566
You know, this process will go
a long way towards clarifying
that identity issue.

208
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:33,928
What process? Who is this new friend
with the camera already?

209
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,367
I've only been trying to introduce
you to her for the last ten minutes.

210
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:39,364
- Her name is Tina Kalb, and she's here
for a very important reason.
- You're getting a divorce.

211
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:42,489
-She's a counsellor. No, she's a lawyer.
-Would you-- Would you just zip it?

212
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:45,211
- Don't talk to your mother like that.
- We're not getting a divorce.

213
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,567
Maybe you should
if you can't name the baby.

214
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:50,690
- That is a terrible,
sick thing to say, Ed!
- You said it first!

215
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:53,651
- That's no excuse!
- If you say it, fine.
If I say it, I'm sick.

216
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:56,088
- Maybe.
- Tina is with the adoption agency.

217
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,052
- What adoption agency?
- The adoption agency
where you adopted me.

218
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:03,569
- When I was a little baby, remember?
- Oh, my God!

219
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:10,242
Oh, God. I have to have a cigarette
if we're gonna talk about this.

220
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:14,043
- Can I bum one of those?
- No, you can't smoke around the baby.

221
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:19,891
- Show a little compassion, will you?
- This might be a good time
to make an exception. For her.

222
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:23,854
- Pearl!
- I'd like to know what happened
to the Constitution in this country.

223
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,052
- Please, can you please put it out?
- Oh, all right, all right!

224
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:31,765
Why does he have to do this roots thing?
Aren't we good enough parents?

225
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:35,768
I think you probably
did the best that you could,
but psychic scars can't be helped.

226
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,166
Psychic scars?
What is she talking about?

227
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:47,490
She's saying we failed completely.

228
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:51,615
- That's way too extreme.
- Yeah, maybe just 40 percent.

229
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:54,450
Mom, you can't quantify it like that.
I mean, what difference does it make...

230
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:56,892
if it's 40 percent or 60 percent?

231
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,888
Sixty percent?

232
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:01,571
Why is everybody getting
so serious all of a sudden?

233
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,648
I thought we were gonna talk
about buying new carpeting...

234
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:06,615
getting rid of this crap,
putting in the wall-to-wall.

235
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:09,166
Life is so rich, so full.

236
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:12,409
You have a wife,
a child, a good job.

237
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:14,887
Why are you doing this?

238
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:19,654
If I could pop in here for a second,
I think that what Mel is trying
to communicate here...

239
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:23,811
is that no matter where we are in our
lives, especially if we're adopted...

240
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:26,732
we can't help but feel
that there's something missing--

241
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:30,937
that there's something out there
that's going to make us feel...

242
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,978
complete, give us a sense of belonging,
connectedness if you will.

243
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,688
This woman strikes me
as being very dangerous.

244
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:41,340
It's understandable
that you would find me threatening.

245
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,014
Why don't you psychoanalyze me?
I'd love to hear this. Go ahead.

246
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,729
I'm, uh, abrasive,
pushy, defensive.

247
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,573
My husband is, uh, food-phobic,
passive-aggressive.

248
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,289
- Huh? Come on. Come on.
- Look, the point is, we're going
to San Diego in the morning, and--

249
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,416
What about your father's 60th birthday?

250
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,414
Well, if you'd let me finish what
I'm saying, I'd say that we have every
intention of coming back for it.

251
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,811
You are aware that they have a very big
car theft problem in San Diego.

252
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:06,699
- No, I wasn't aware of that.
- Oh, yes, very big.

253
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,817
I hadn't heard anything
about that either.

254
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:11,574
They bump you,
and when you stop...

255
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:13,573
they mutilate you
and then take your car.

256
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:16,096
- It happened to Art Sackhein.
- What?

257
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:18,616
- They killed Art Sackhein?
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

258
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:21,580
They bumped him and took his car.
Nobody said anything about killing.

259
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:25,416
- You said mutilate.
- Anyway--
- Please.

260
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:29,132
Enjoy yourself. I understand
they have a lovely zoo in San Diego.

261
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:36,140
- Are you ready for San Diego?
- Yeah!
- Yes.

262
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,498
- God, you look beautiful.
- So do you.

263
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,494
Oh, thanks.
You know, maybe I'll just--

264
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,619
I'll run upstairs really quickly
and change, 'cause I don't think--

265
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:45,138
- Don't be silly. You look adorable.
- You look so elegant.
- Honey.

266
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:48,421
- I love that print. Come on.
- Honey, you look great. Come on.

267
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,536
Do you have the keys?

268
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:57,219
I left with the feeling
this road was endless

269
00:14:57,304 --> 00:15:02,459
Now it seems there's three days
to heaven, it's okay

270
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:06,424
'Cause these wheels
are takin'me home again

271
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,894
It's all right

272
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:12,455
I've got three days to heaven
then I'm gonna make you mine

273
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:20,336
Boy, it's beautiful, here, isn't it?

274
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:23,179
Sweetie, I'm so happy
we're doing this together.

275
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,382
- Watch the road, please.
- Me too.

276
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,536
- How's the baby's diaper?
- He's fine.

277
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,584
- Good.
- What's that?

278
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:34,257
Oh, my God. It's happening. Shit!

279
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:36,144
- Oh, God, no.
- What's happening?

280
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,424
It's the bump and rob.
This is it.

281
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:41,338
- Get down!
- What? What?
- Get down with the baby!

282
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,463
- He's gaining on us!
- Yo, slow down!

283
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,981
- Back off, Jack!
- Pull over!

284
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:48,741
- How do you close this window?
- Wait. I've got some Mace in my bag.
- Damn it.

285
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,945
- It's not working!
- Listen to what he has to say.
- Here it is.

286
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:54,940
- Mace him!
- Yeah, get him!
- No!

287
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:56,939
Fucker!

288
00:15:58,228 --> 00:16:01,300
You left your jacket
in the parking lot.

289
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,538
Asshole!

290
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,541
Thank you for the jacket.
Sorry about the Mace.

291
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,221
Very sorry, sir.

292
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:15,343
''The Trinity Church Ministry of Hope.''
Oh, my God!

293
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:21,259
They bump you,
and when you stop...

294
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,820
they mutilate you
and take your car.

295
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,505
- I don't think it's funny at all.
I mean, his father created this fear--
- It is too funny.
- It's funny.

296
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,468
- Would you two, both of you,
just stop, please?
- And then--
- We're almost there.

297
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,545
- I'm getting nervous.
- Really, I'm not surprised
at his reaction or by my reaction.

298
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:52,586
- Okay, just breathe.
- Ohh.

299
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:56,221
- Should I ring the doorbell?
- Okay.

300
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:58,701
- I mean, no. Wait, wait, wait.
I told you to wait.
- You said yes first.

301
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,022
- You didn't give me a chance to say no.
- Well, I would've, but--

302
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:03,580
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Hi.

303
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:07,791
Oh, what a pretty wife you have!
And I see you've brought your nanny.

304
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:11,502
- Oh, I'm not the nanny. I'm the wife.
- Oh, excuse me.

305
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:14,153
- What a terrible way to start.
- Oh, don't be silly.

306
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,906
I'm Tina Kalb from
the Maidstone Adoption Agency.

307
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:20,030
- Right.
- Hi.
- Hi.

308
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:22,627
- Valerie Swaney.
- Mel Coplin.

309
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:29,024
- This is great.
I love the stained glass.
- Lovely.

310
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,948
- Thank you.
- Oh!
- Now, he was a great president.

311
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,389
You know, I always felt like
I should've appreciated him more.

312
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:38,750
I know just what you mean.
Come on, let's get something to drink.

313
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,506
Your daddy was short.

314
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,106
That would explain it.

315
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:52,153
And we have the same forehead,
don't we?

316
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:55,706
And the same eyes. Oh.

317
00:17:55,796 --> 00:18:00,711
This is amazing. I never shared
physical traits with family before.

318
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:06,315
I'm a bad person
for what I did to you.

319
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:08,830
- No, don't say that.
- It's true.

320
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,432
Look, Tina says that most women
who gave up their children
for adoption in the '60s...

321
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:17,033
were independent young women
acting against a conservative world.

322
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:22,070
- You're sayin' I was a slut?
- No.

323
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:25,513
- Oh, God!
- I didn't think-- You're not a slut.

324
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:28,556
I was tall,
and I developed earlier--

325
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:32,347
If that's a crime, go ahead and sue me,
but I am not from trashy people.

326
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:36,113
- Really, I wasn't
suggesting that at all.
- Your daddy was poor.

327
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,349
He worked in my father's
liquor warehouse in Baton Rouge.

328
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:42,271
- Really? Baton Rouge.
- That's where you were conceived.

329
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,998
In the liquor warehouse
on the cement floor...

330
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,118
- Wow!
- in Baton Rouge.
Oh, my parents hated Lars.

331
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:52,748
- Lars Waara was his name.
- Waara? Lars Waara!

332
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,672
- What kind of name is that?
- Finnish.

333
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,228
- Finnish? I'm Finnish.
- I knew that.

334
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,515
I mean, look at your face.
Absolutely.

335
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,830
Finnish-American.
Half Scottish-American.

336
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,879
Scottish-Finnish. What is that?
I don't know how to do that. That's--

337
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,880
I'm gonna help.
I'm gonna help you with that.

338
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,749
This belonged to my
great-great-grandmama
who was of the Clan Bucanon...

339
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:18,038
- Wow!
- married to the Confederate
General Beauregard.

340
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,874
- I want you to have it.
- A Confederate general?

341
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,873
Mm-hmm.
Expert boxer and marksman.

342
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:26,521
- Really? Wow!
- Wow!
- What an athletic family, huh?

343
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:30,561
- I was on two championship
basketball teams myself.
- I'm not athletic at all.

344
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:34,430
- Look at this picture. This is--
Let's name the baby Beauregard, huh?
- Beauregard?

345
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,433
- Beau. Beau Coplin.
- Beau?
- I'm so touched.

346
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:38,513
- Beau Coplin. Ah, yeah!
- Oh, damn it!

347
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:41,753
- What?
- The camera just jammed.
- You didn't get that just now?

348
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:44,914
- No, and that was a terrific moment.
- Let me see.
- Forget the camera.

349
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:47,437
- No, I can't.
- No, forget-- That's-- Forget about it.

350
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:50,515
- What? Don't you want
to get it on tape?
- I'd like to have it on tape.

351
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,276
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Uh, the light's better
in the living room.

352
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:56,196
- Look, honey, I'll be right back, okay?
- I-I don't know what happened.

353
00:19:56,283 --> 00:20:01,437
- He's a very decisive man, isn't he?
- Well, actually he's not.
But today, for some reason--

354
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:04,675
Do you see that, that wheel in there?
There's like a glob of gunk.

355
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:07,722
- Yeah, I do.
- Tar.
- We need something to wipe it off with.

356
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:11,763
- If we could get like a--
- What? You know what? I don't--
Let's just use my skirt.

357
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,312
- Your skirt?
- I don't care about it. It's old.
- Really? Okay.

358
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:16,634
-Just hold this, okay?
- Okay. Here.

359
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:20,161
-Just-- If you can--
- Hold still.
- Yeah. Okay.

360
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:23,123
I'm Beauregard from Dixie, hooray--

361
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,241
Technically, he's from New York.
Right?

362
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,998
- I'm sorry. Oh. I'm sorry.
- Well--

363
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:30,519
- Uh, you got it, though. You got it.
- Good.

364
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,403
- Yeah. So how long did you say
you were a dancer for?
- Oh, God, don't remind me.

365
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:36,398
- I haven't been to the gym in months.
- Well, you don't seem like
you need to go to the gym.

366
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,522
- I mean--
- Well, you're very generous.

367
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:42,599
- Yeah.
- But when I was dancing, you know,
my calves did not look like this.

368
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,439
- Those look like
very strong calves to me.
- Well, strong, yeah.

369
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,120
They've always been strong.
When I was a kid, you know...

370
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,119
I used to beat my brothers
at Indian wrestling all the time.

371
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:54,483
Away down south in Dixie

372
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,240
He's a little cracker.

373
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:59,238
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not a cracker.
- You can't deny--

374
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,646
- I'm not a cracker!
- Ohh.

375
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,797
You feel it in your legs?

376
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,083
It's really more about upper-body
strength, isn't it?

377
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:08,557
- No, it's all in the legs.
- How?

378
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:10,878
You'll see
when you lose your balance.

379
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:17,327
- Oh!
- What in the world?

380
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:20,286
Oh, my Lord!

381
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:23,486
My Chinese zodiac is ruined!

382
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:26,845
- I am so sorry. I really feel badly.
- Oh, my goodness. My animals.
- What else happened?

383
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,160
- We were just in here,
and then, um, freak accident.
- I'm so sorry.

384
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,559
- Yeah.Just--
- The shelf--
- What happened to the tail
of my rooster?

385
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:35,958
- You mean-- Is this it, maybe?
- No.

386
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:38,245
- That's the dog's pillow.
Oh.

387
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,560
Well, don't throw it!

388
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,959
I want to pay for all this.
Can I do that, please?

389
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,166
- Absolutely not.
- Why not?

390
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,844
All children break things,
and all children are forgiven.

391
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,922
Now, you have never had
that opportunity with me.

392
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,447
Let's take this
as a gift from God.

393
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:58,683
And look, here's
another gift from God.

394
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:01,888
Ohhh, well, why is that
a gift from God?

395
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:06,044
The rabbit is still in one piece,
and both you and your daddy
were Year of the Rabbit.

396
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:09,488
I always thought it was
Year of the Dragon, at least in all
those Chinese restaurant place mats.

397
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:13,087
No, no, no. Lars is 1939.
You're 1963.

398
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:16,528
- Those are both rabbit years.
- Actually, I was born in '65.

399
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:23,449
- Don't you think I know
when my own son was born?
- 'Course you do, Valerie.

400
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:26,730
Wait, that would make me two years
older than I thought I was. Wow!

401
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:31,284
- How? How is that?
- You know what? I can clear this up
with one phone call to the office.

402
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:35,651
- Yeah, why don't you make sure?
This really-- It kind of freaks me out.
- Mom, why are those cars here?

403
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:39,123
- Hey, girls, look who's here!
- What happened to your glass animals?

404
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:41,603
Oh, these are my twins
from my third marriage.

405
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,492
- This is Jane, and this is Sandra.
- Hello.

406
00:22:44,574 --> 00:22:48,203
- This is your half brother, Mel.
- He looks just like Uncle Freddie.
- Oh, man!

407
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:50,603
- Look at his nose.
- What's so funny?

408
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:53,731
- What's so funny?
- He looks just like Uncle Freddie.

409
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:56,568
Yes, he does.
Why didn't I see that?

410
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,725
Oh, Uncle Freddie. I'm flattered.
What's he like?

411
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:01,454
He's really sweet-natured. He's just
that weird thing. What do you call it?

412
00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:03,571
- ''Frateurist.''
- Yeah, he's a frateurist.

413
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:07,933
- Frateurist? What's that?
- You rub up against people
in crowded public places.

414
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:10,245
- That's how I met Mel.
- Seriously?

415
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:12,770
- No, she's kidding.
- This is not something to kid about.

416
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:16,132
- Yeah. He went to jail for it.
- Oh.
- Can he come to the beach?

417
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:18,889
- Oh, honey, I don't think
he's got time for that, Jane.
- Why not?

418
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:22,048
- We're in the volleyball finals.
- He can wear one of my shirts.
- Oh, yeah, give him a shirt.

419
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:25,412
- We'll go down to the beach. This is--
- You girls!
- We're in the championship.

420
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:27,054
- Oh, man, you should've
been there yesterday.
- Wow. Uh-huh.

421
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:29,446
- It was so amazing.
- It was match point.
- Match point.

422
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:32,574
- I went up for the spike.
- She went up for the spike.
- Shut up. Let me talk.

423
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:34,966
- So I went up for the spike.
- It was so intense.
She went up for the spike--
- Shut up!

424
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:38,686
- Girls, girls, calm down!
- Listen, I, I, I don't believe this...

425
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,530
but there's been
a terrible, terrible mistake.

426
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:44,052
And Valerie's
not your mother, Mel.

427
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:46,527
- What?
- What are you talking about?
Of course she's my mother.

428
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:49,655
- We have the same forehead.
- And he looks like Uncle Freddie.
- Yeah, I look like Uncle Freddie.

429
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:52,696
Please, just don't make this any harder
on yourself than it already is.

430
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:54,689
- Are you positive?
- Yes.
- He's not our brother?

431
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:56,894
How could you make
a mistake like that? I--

432
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,287
Well, our computer files
were in transition...

433
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:02,337
and Valerie's son
is named Martin Coplin...

434
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,207
- and he lives in Orlando, Florida--
- What? My son? Who is this man?

435
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,497
Not your son. Mel,
your father is named, uh...

436
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,173
Fritz Boudreau,
and he lives in Gundall, Michigan.

437
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,094
- So I was thinking, maybe on our way
to New York, we could stop off or--
- Who are these people in my home?

438
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,648
-I feel like a complete idiot. I'm so--
-Well, I take these people into my home.

439
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,971
- I know.
- We fly all the way out here,
we have this big, tearful reunion--
- Their child is here.

440
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,733
Yeah, well, get it out, Nancy. It's
gonna make us all feel a lot better.

441
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,129
- Are you humouring me?
- No, I am not humouring you.
- I don't think this is funny.

442
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,212
- I'm very serious. I certainly don't--
- Excuse-- No, excuse me!
I expect you to pay for this damage.

443
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,419
Well, w-wait a minute. You said
it was a gift from God. Remember?

444
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:37,412
That's when you were my son.

445
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:40,573
- Well, don't you have
insurance or something?
- And raise my premiums?

446
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:44,017
No, thank you. May I have
my pendant back, please?

447
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:47,936
- Can we have our shirt back?
- We'd let you keep it. It's just that
we don't have very many of them.

448
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:50,934
- Yeah. There's only, like, ten left.
- Yeah. No, sure.
- I'm sorry.

449
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:54,571
- Sorry.
- I understand.
- Thanks.

450
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:57,699
- Have a nice life.
- Yeah, good luck with this
whole family thing, you know.

451
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:00,421
- Thank you.
- I hope it works out for you.

452
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:02,811
You have my other knee pad?

453
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:10,654
How could you be related? How?

454
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:15,259
She is a six-foot blonde descendant
from the clan Bucanon.

455
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:18,062
We were only trying
to be open to them.

456
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,942
Well, we could be open with them,
but we don't have to become them.

457
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:24,494
I thought she was my mother.
Come on, give me a break.

458
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:30,499
How did you happen to knock down
those glass shelves, anyway?

459
00:25:31,984 --> 00:25:33,895
I don't know. I just--

460
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:38,661
You know, we were trying to fix
the camera, and we bumped into them.

461
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,499
It's strange you would just
happen to bump into them.

462
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:45,577
Well, we were also
Indian wrestling.

463
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:50,461
Indian wrestling?
What is that?

464
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:54,937
It's just this game that kids play.
It's a very innocent little kids' game.

465
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:56,982
Why were you playing that?

466
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:02,141
Because we were talking
about athleticism in Tina's family...

467
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:06,105
and then how Valerie's family
was athletic also, and-- I don't know.

468
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:20,140
- You're attracted to her, aren't you?
- No.

469
00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:22,788
That's okay.
She's attractive.

470
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:26,417
Yeah, she's attractive,
but I'm, I'm married to you.

471
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:29,022
You know, she may be attractive,
but she's got a screw loose.

472
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:31,338
Yes, I agree with you.
She's very eccentric.

473
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:35,421
But I'm definitely--
I'm in love with you, honey. Honey?

474
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:39,666
The revolution
came and left today

475
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:46,106
Nobody knew it came and went

476
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:49,067
And so did Judgement Day

477
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,187
In somebody else's body

478
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:55,226
With someone else's head

479
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,549
In somebody else's body

480
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,259
When I was someone else instead

481
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,467
In somebody else's body

482
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,745
With someone else's head

483
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,109
When you're in somebody else's body

484
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:17,230
- In someone else's bed
- Hey, I think this is the place.

485
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:29,186
- This looks muy macho, doesn't it?
- Creepy to me.

486
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,183
Oh, no, look.
Somebody's coming out, Mel.

487
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:34,025
Hey! Hi!

488
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:38,861
- Excuse me. Is one of you fellows
Fritz Boudreau?
- Hey!

489
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:42,070
- Did I invite you onto my property?
- Hey, take it easy! Take it easy!

490
00:27:42,153 --> 00:27:45,941
- Tina, don't go over there!
- Hey! Oh, my God!

491
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:49,582
Would you let me explain?
We can talk about--

492
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:53,029
- Fuck! Run!
- What's happening?

493
00:27:53,113 --> 00:27:55,183
Fuck! The car's this way!

494
00:27:57,253 --> 00:27:59,688
Would you stay away!
Son of a bitch!

495
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:04,465
- Doesn't he want to see me?
- Well, I felt so bad about San Diego,
I bent the rules a little bit.

496
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:07,307
- Did you-- Did he-- Did you call them?
- Yes, I tried to!

497
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,669
- His phone isn't working.
- What the fuck you people
talking about?

498
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,383
We just wanted to know if one of you
is Fritz Boudreau, because they said
he was my father.

499
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:16,706
What did they say?
Who said I'm your father?

500
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,867
- She did.
- The Maidstone Adoption Agency.

501
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:22,992
Why, you little shit!
Look at this turd face, Mitch!

502
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:26,272
This turd is my son.
I'm sorry, man. Did we scare you?

503
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:29,267
- Yeah, a little.
- A little bit.
- We were scared too.

504
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:32,473
How did we know? I dropped
a lot of baby batter in my day.

505
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:35,673
- This is the first son I ever met.
- Wow.
- What a wonderful moment.

506
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:39,351
- I wish I had my camera.
- You picked a hell of a time
to drop by, turd face.

507
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:45,068
- Well, your phone wasn't working.
- Nah, I don't need no son to give me
no guilt trip about a phone.

508
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:48,069
Fritzie, Fritzie,
we gotta get goin', pal.

509
00:28:48,157 --> 00:28:49,875
- Remember?
- Shit.
- What?

510
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:51,913
- Come on.
- Goin' somewhere?
- Yeah.

511
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:55,910
- Where do you have to go?
- We gotta get the wheels balanced
for a big trip tomorrow.

512
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:58,909
- Where you goin'?
- After Eugene balances the wheels...

513
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:02,673
- we're gonna be out
for about three weeks.
- Three weeks? Really?
- Damn.

514
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:06,068
- Bad timing.
- Why don't we bring 'em along?

515
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:09,275
Huh? You know, it's only
20 minutes over to Eugene's.

516
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:12,031
- Yeah. Come on with us.
- What? In the truck?

517
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,586
- Hey, you ever been in a truck before?
- No, not really.

518
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,153
How do you like this?
First time in a rig, huh?

519
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:24,311
- It's great.
- It's really fabulous, Mr Boudreau.

520
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,391
Some people look down on drivers,
like we're low class.

521
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:30,516
Not me. I always wanted to learn
how to drive a big rig.

522
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,273
- You never told me that.
- Well, I might not have voiced it
until now...

523
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,477
-but it's always been a fantasy of mine.
-You want a lesson?

524
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,710
- You'd give me a lesson?
- Sure! Why not?

525
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,916
Let's not do this
while the baby's in the truck.

526
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,639
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course I trust you.

527
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,554
- But he's never done this before.
- She's not gonna let you drive
the truck, so forget about it.

528
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,439
- Are you sayin' my son's a bitch boy?
- I didn't say that!

529
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:53,160
- What's your name again?
- Mel.

530
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,311
You ain't no bitch boy,
are ya, Mel?

531
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:58,040
No, I don't believe
I'm a bitch boy.

532
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,351
Don't let him bait you
into doing something stupid, Mel.

533
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:02,352
Nancy, Mel needs your support now.

534
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:04,716
- Yeah, I need your support, honey.
- Yeah.

535
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,838
- I support you, Mel.
- Me too!

536
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:10,278
I wanna get out.
You're acting like a real asshole.

537
00:30:10,362 --> 00:30:12,273
Pussy-whipped.

538
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:24,161
We're comin' back in 15 minutes.
What's the big deal?

539
00:30:24,243 --> 00:30:27,952
Hey! Get away!
Have a great trip, okay?

540
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:32,480
- We'll be supporting you from out here.
May I have my baby, please?
- Nancy.

541
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:37,160
Just send us a postcard,
'cause we'll be right here
at the Gundall Post Office, okay?

542
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:40,680
This isn't gonna take long, honey.
Just calm down.

543
00:30:40,764 --> 00:30:44,393
So remember,
it's like a butterfly's wings.
Use a little gas, a little clutch.

544
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:47,044
- A little gas, a little clutch.
- A little gas, a little clutch.
What happens if I hit this?

545
00:30:47,124 --> 00:30:52,323
- What does that do? Is that okay?
- You know somethin'? You got a--
You got a kind of Jew look, don't you?

546
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:55,795
Well, the people who raised me
are Jewish. Maybe that's
what you're picking up on.

547
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:58,080
They-They gave you
a real ''Hebe'' look, kid.

548
00:30:58,165 --> 00:31:00,838
- Mitch, don't say that.
That's not nice.
- Wait a second. Wait--

549
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:05,396
No, it's not a Jew face. It's--
It's a face like Old Needledick's!

550
00:31:05,485 --> 00:31:08,444
Yeah! You're not in some kind
of science, are you, kid?

551
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,596
Science? Actually,
I'm an entomologist.

552
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:12,756
-Entomologist sounds like science to me.
-Wait, wait, wait.

553
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:14,882
Who's-Who's Old Needledick?
What are you talking about?

554
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:18,515
When I met your mother, I was ridin'
with the Angels in Oakland, Cal.

555
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:20,517
- Uh-huh. The Hell's Angels? Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

556
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,915
And we got invited
to all these fancy parties...

557
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,760
because rich people liked
to hang around with the Angels...

558
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:28,315
and musical bands and whatnot.

559
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:32,719
And your mother
meets this guy, Richard Schlich--

560
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:36,038
- I can never pronounce
that cocksucker's name.
- Schlichling.

561
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,960
Okay, okay. So she meets this guy,
Richard Schlich-- Schlichling.

562
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:42,484
-And what? What? They went off together?
-They ran off together...

563
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,162
to Antelope Wells.

564
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:48,844
- You're saying--
- This can't be happening.

565
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:51,283
You're saying you're not sure
if you're my father?

566
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,405
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.
- But the records show...

567
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:57,049
that-that you're the one
who brought him into the agency.

568
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:01,964
I did a good deed as a favour, because
his mother and father were indisposed.

569
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,768
- Indisposed how?
- You'll have to ask your mother
about that.

570
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:07,647
But we don't know where she is.
So isn't it possible...

571
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:09,924
that you got her pregnant
before she left you?

572
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:13,446
- No, no, no! With this face,
this science thing--
- Hey, we're movin' backwards here.

573
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,044
- Where's the brake? Do I--
- Put it in first.

574
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,409
Oh, my God! Mel!

575
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,401
I don't think it's wrong
to want to take a driving lesson
with your father, right?

576
00:32:28,491 --> 00:32:31,210
- I'm not speaking to you.
- Sweetie, I'm sorry about this.

577
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:34,328
Give me a kiss.
Sweetie, give me--

578
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,164
- Hey, Mr Boudreau,
where is Antelope Wells?
- Please step off.

579
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:39,890
- Sorry, do you know
where Antelope Wells is?
- I have no idea.Just--

580
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:43,281
She doesn't know
what the hell she's doing.
That man was a lunatic, a stranger!

581
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:46,921
- Okay, okay.
- Mr Boudreau, please, before you go...

582
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:49,731
- Tommy, get her off me! Move!
-just tell me where Antelope Wells is.

583
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:53,566
- When I say step off, I mean step off!
- Hey! I am from New York, okay?

584
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:57,804
On the upside, Antelope Wells
should be warmer than this place.

585
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,930
So we're just gonna jump on a plane
to New Mexico? Is that it?

586
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:04,164
Well, I think that we should finish
what we started.

587
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,493
Agent Paul Harmon,
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

588
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:10,246
This is Agent Tony Kent.
Now let's see.

589
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:14,451
You, uh, you thought this
Fritz Boudreau was your father,
but, in fact, he's not your father.

590
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:17,685
- Well, no, I--
- Tony. Tony Kent.

591
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:21,164
- Nancy Curwin.
- This is unbelievable!

592
00:33:21,254 --> 00:33:23,165
We went to high school
together in Chicago.

593
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:26,087
- You look fantastic!
- Now--
- No!

594
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:28,608
- God!
- What are you doing in this police job?

595
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:31,653
Oh, I need a health plan
while I'm writing my first book.
What are you doing now?

596
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,930
- I'm curating.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. There's
something here we gotta take care of.

597
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:37,564
- Okay?
- I'm sorry, Paul. Go ahead.

598
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:41,364
You do know it's a Federal offence
to destroy a United States post office.

599
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:43,844
Well, it wasn't like it was
some premeditated act of terrorism.

600
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:45,846
- You know what I mean?
- I'll be the judge of that.

601
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:48,894
Now, the ostensible purpose
for this truck ride was what exactly?

602
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:50,967
He was giving me a lesson.
It was very simple.

603
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:54,412
- He just wanted to teach me
how to drive the truck.
- This baby is beautiful.

604
00:33:54,496 --> 00:33:56,532
- Thanks.
- Oh, gorgeous blue eyes.

605
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:59,414
- Tony, Tony, Tony.
- You know, he looks a lot like you.

606
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,885
- Tony. Tony.
- Thank you.
-Just-- In a minute.

607
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:04,969
- Give the baby back.
- Hey, feel his little grip.
It's so strong.

608
00:34:05,057 --> 00:34:07,651
- Feel it.
-Jesus Christ!

609
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:10,092
- Hey.
- I'm s-- I'm--

610
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:13,055
- You're under way too much stress.
- Listen, this man drove a semi
into a Federal building.

611
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:15,571
You were gonna give him a warning.
It's an accident, remember.

612
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:18,649
- There's certain procedures
that you have to follow.
- Right. He's got a valid licence.

613
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:21,172
- Not to drive a truck! He does not!
- It was the trucker's fault...

614
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:24,773
- for letting him drive
in the first place.
- All right, okay.
Can I talk with you in private?

615
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,975
This is my investigation.

616
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:38,778
- I just said you didn't
have to suspend his licence.
- Here, I'll take the baby.

617
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:42,408
- You gotta start taking the job--
- So what's the deal with this guy, huh?

618
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:46,048
- We went to high school together.
- You just went to high school together?

619
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,097
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you know him well, or is it--

620
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,252
- He was on the football team.
- Oh, the football team. Oh.

621
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,050
- It's not a murder.
It's-It's not a bank robbery.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

622
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,177
-Just cut the baby crap.
- Oh, all right. I'm sorry.

623
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,853
So it looks like
this Boudreau fellow...

624
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:17,092
is gonna take the rap
for you driving the truck, so...

625
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,570
I'm just gonna give you a warning.

626
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:23,293
But I'm-- If you--

627
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:27,341
If you drive a truck again, they're
gonna take your licence away for sure.

628
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:28,491
- Okay.
- You understand?

629
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:31,301
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

630
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:34,895
- Is that it? Are we free to go now?
- You are free to go, yes.

631
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:38,133
- Great. Let's get out of here.
- Uh, hey, do you guys
have a place to stay tonight?

632
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,453
- Probably check into a motel.
- No, don't do that.

633
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:43,819
- There's so many wonderful B-and-B's
right here in Lake Michigan.
- Oh, I hate B-and-B's.

634
00:35:43,903 --> 00:35:47,532
-Why do you hate B-and-B's?
-Well, first of all, there's no privacy.

635
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:50,615
- No privacy. Uh-huh.
- Yeah. And you have to,
you have to make chitchat...

636
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:53,661
- with the boring old lady
who runs the place--
- That's kind of the fun, isn't it?

637
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:56,577
Yeah, there's always the little cat,
little cat-- You have to pretend
like you like the cat.

638
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:59,497
Yeah, well, whatever we do, we need
to eat first, 'cause I'm starving.

639
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:01,973
- Why don't we take you out to dinner?
- Are we apologizing for the arrest?

640
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:03,975
No, but it would be nice
to catch up with Nancy.

641
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:06,532
- We could take them to Minetti's.
- Minetti's is great...

642
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:09,184
- but you're not gonna get a reservation
this time of night at Minetti's.
- You know what? Thanks. Thanks anyway.

643
00:36:09,264 --> 00:36:12,462
- But we'll be fine, really.
- See? We don't want to intrude, Tony.

644
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:16,015
No, no, no, no, no. Don't be silly.
We're getting sick of each other's
company anyways.

645
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:17,823
- Oh.
- You see? I told you.

646
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:21,539
- Hey, stop that!
- I can't believe you're a writer now.

647
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:27,064
Well, an aspiring writer.
I'm trying to get this whole book
together, this crime fiction thing.

648
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:30,536
You were such a jock in high school.
You were so wild.

649
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:33,698
I know. And you were
such an egghead, remember?

650
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:36,095
- No.
- You were an egghead.
- No!

651
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:39,337
- So what I'm asking is, you fly
into Albuquerque and then rent a car...
- We're going to Texas tomorrow.

652
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:42,783
- and how far--
- It's way down. Way down at the
southeastern corner of the state.

653
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,665
- Wait. Excuse me.
Have you been there before?
- It's almost in Mexico, in fact.
I've been near there.

654
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:50,025
- Antelope Wells is right near
the White Sands National Monument.
- Uh-huh.

655
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,702
They've got this fantastic,
uh, hot springs nearby
that not many people know about.

656
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:57,621
Oh, I wish you could come along and show
me around while Mel meets his family.

657
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:01,462
- You have the personal days.
You should do it, Paul.
- I can't take time off work right now.

658
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:04,016
- Unbelievable line at the bathroom!
- I told 'em they gotta get
a bigger bathroom.

659
00:37:04,108 --> 00:37:07,623
Look at him. He loves you.
You're wonderful with children.

660
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:11,781
Oh, I want one of these
so badly. I'm telling you.

661
00:37:11,868 --> 00:37:15,464
Hey, could you help me out
with an adoption, Tina?

662
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:19,739
Well, that depends on the specifics
of your situation.

663
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:23,299
- Well, like what?
- Number one: Are you married?

664
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:25,505
- Yes.
- Number two: Does your spouse work?

665
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:29,424
- Yeah.
- And is she willing to adopt?
- You see, that's where the snag is.

666
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,466
Then you've got a real problem.

667
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,704
What would my chances be
as a single parent?

668
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,941
- Excuse me, please.
- Why can't you stay and discuss this?

669
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,305
- 'Cause I believe in privacy,
that's why.
- Right. We have nothing
to be ashamed of, though.

670
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,622
Because I don't want
to share my personal life
with everybody I meet, okay?

671
00:37:47,711 --> 00:37:49,906
She's not just anyone.
She works in an adoption agency.

672
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:53,427
I thought that she
could be helpful. God!

673
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:58,062
You know, I keep telling him
that having a baby will reduce stress
by taking his mind off work...

674
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:01,349
but he just--
he doesn't listen, you know?

675
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:04,504
So where did you folks come down
on the big circumcision controversy?

676
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,822
'Cause, you know, there's a movement
afoot these days to keep the foreskin...

677
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:11,747
and, personally, I think a boy's penis
should look just like his father's.

678
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:14,665
- You know?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Can I have the baby?

679
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:19,463
Oh, sure. Yeah.
Here we go. Oh, so cute.

680
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:31,192
My late husband devised
his own anti-erosion system...

681
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:36,473
that later on we had patented
on the advice of a dear friend...

682
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:41,309
who was in a law office
with Gerald Ford.

683
00:38:41,394 --> 00:38:45,865
My brother has the same birthday
as President Ford...

684
00:38:45,954 --> 00:38:49,186
who is a very sweet man.

685
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:51,550
We met him twice.

686
00:38:53,395 --> 00:38:58,105
Once at a political rally
and once at a golf tournament.

687
00:38:58,195 --> 00:39:01,392
And his wife
is such a sweet lady.

688
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:04,353
Betty Ford is so pretty.

689
00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:06,904
And why couldn't we go to a motel?

690
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:10,272
Because at a motel
we don't have the bonus...

691
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:15,589
of someone related
to Gerald Ford's birthday.

692
00:39:15,676 --> 00:39:19,225
We forgot your father's birthday.

693
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,467
Oh, fuck.

694
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:28,875
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

695
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:31,107
So, how's the psychic healing going?

696
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:33,665
I am really sorry we didn't
get back for Dad's birthday.

697
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:36,431
It's all right. We'll try it again
when he turns 65...

698
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:39,032
provided he lives that long
and you're not too busy.

699
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:41,393
- I said I was sorry.
- Why are you whispering?

700
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:44,595
- Because I'm not supposed
to be using this phone.
- Are you all right?

701
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:46,794
We're fine. It's just--
There was a big mix-up in San Diego...

702
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:49,551
and then I ended up flattening
a post office with a truck.

703
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:52,277
- What truck?
- Truck? What's happening with a truck?

704
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:55,431
We had the wrong information.
But we have the right information now,
and we're going to New Mexico.

705
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,192
- New Mexico?
- Tell him they got uranium
in the water down there.

706
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:00,315
Shush. He's in
some kind of trouble.

707
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,435
- Did your car get bumped in San Diego?
- No!

708
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,079
I mean, yes, there was
a minor incident. Nothing--

709
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:09,278
No, no! We don't do this here,
unless it's an emergency.

710
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,476
- What's the emergency?
- Is it the baby?

711
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,120
-Oh, my God! What's wrong with the baby?
-The baby is fine.

712
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,236
- Good. Then hang up.
- Do you need help?

713
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,118
- Things aren't--
- Do you see this sign?
''No phone calls after 8:00 p.m.

714
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,875
- Use gas station at corner.''
- All right. Could I, could I
just have 30 seconds, please?

715
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,270
No. Do you want to pay
my phone bills?

716
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:27,272
- Thirty seconds.
- Hang up!

717
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:29,670
- Is that tyrant your mother?
- No. I have to go, all right?

718
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,434
- We're gonna be with the Schlichtings.
- The ''Shitkings''?

719
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:35,752
- What kind of a name is Shitking?
- Schlichting. Schlichting.
They're my parents.

720
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:38,275
- What kind of a name is Shitking?
- Verboten means verboten!
- I don't know.

721
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:41,320
I think it's German.
We're gonna be in Antelope Wells.

722
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:45,474
Hello? Mel?

723
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,360
- I used my calling card.
- That's not the point!

724
00:41:03,123 --> 00:41:05,683
I think something terrible
is happening to him.

725
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,197
- Calm down, calm down.
- I can't calm down!

726
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:11,355
- What did he say?
- We have to do something.

727
00:41:11,443 --> 00:41:13,878
- All right, well, we'll call back.
- We can't call back.

728
00:41:13,964 --> 00:41:16,797
He's on his way
to New Mexico, for God's sake!

729
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:20,081
Who knows what kind of people he's with?
Anything is possible.

730
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:22,394
Don't say that!
You're starting to scare me.

731
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:24,759
- I am not. You were already scared.
- I was not!

732
00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:27,643
- Yes, you were.
- Eddie, we have to do something!

733
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:30,398
Like what?
There's nothing we can do.

734
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:34,879
- The kitchen's off-limits after 8:00.
- What are you, her spy?

735
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:38,753
- Why didn't you use Tina's phone?
- 'Cause Tina's phone isn't working.

736
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:42,076
You know, it's starting to feel like
this whole thing is a big waste of time.

737
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:47,599
- You're feeling frustrated.
- Yes, I'm feeling very frustrated.

738
00:41:47,686 --> 00:41:50,325
I was worried your expectations
were too high for all of this.

739
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:53,955
- You know, maybe we should just
forget everything and go home.
- Don't do that.

740
00:41:54,046 --> 00:41:57,322
You always get so pessimistic
when you're close to finishing
something you've started.

741
00:41:57,406 --> 00:41:59,602
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.
You did it with the apartment.

742
00:41:59,687 --> 00:42:03,646
You loved it so much. The day we go to
sign the lease, you start freaking out.

743
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:07,481
And the wedding.
How many times did you change the date?

744
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:10,362
You're right. You're right.
I do this all the time.

745
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:12,722
So stick to your plan
for once, okay?

746
00:42:12,807 --> 00:42:15,606
If you want to find your parents,
find your parents.

747
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:23,363
- Oh!
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

748
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:28,078
- Are you okay? You seem upset.
- I owe you a big apology.

749
00:42:28,168 --> 00:42:32,162
I mean, this was--
this is not the way I planned this trip,
not the way I wanted it to turn out.

750
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,366
Look, look, it's been kind of difficult,
but I think we've gotten past the bumps.

751
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:37,883
You know, I feel, I feel really good
about, about where we're going.

752
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:40,927
I really think it's gonna be great.

753
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:45,246
You're such an optimist.
Where does that come from?

754
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,680
Well, you know, I've always said it's
a mistake to let pessimism take over...

755
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,568
right before you're
about to finish something.

756
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:59,246
That's the complete
opposite of my ex-husband.
He was such a pessimistic pig.

757
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,483
Well, I think you're doing
a great job. Really.

758
00:43:04,571 --> 00:43:06,721
- Really.
- Thanks.

759
00:43:06,811 --> 00:43:09,120
- Good night.
- Good night. Good night.

760
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:32,083
Thanks.

761
00:43:33,972 --> 00:43:35,884
Shit.

762
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,691
What was that noise?
Did you drop something?

763
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:52,733
Goddam cat flew out of nowhere.
Scared the hell out of me.

764
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:55,567
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

765
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:58,691
- Where'd you get the pup tent?
- I--

766
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:01,652
I'm feeling very sexual.
I don't know.

767
00:44:01,734 --> 00:44:03,804
I'm just feeling like I want to--

768
00:44:05,374 --> 00:44:09,891
Wait. Let me just
take my glasses off.

769
00:44:11,255 --> 00:44:15,328
Wait a second. Wait, Mel!
Mel, look at me.

770
00:44:17,495 --> 00:44:20,009
Just slow down for a second.
Let's take our time.

771
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,485
- Look at me.
- Huh? Why?

772
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,806
- Why aren't you looking at me?
- What? What? I'm looking at you!

773
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:28,491
- Why do I have to look at you? I mean--
- Well, why can't you look at me?

774
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:38,535
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

775
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:41,131
I mean, don't you ever think
that maybe it's not natural...

776
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:43,253
for two people to be together
their entire lives?

777
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:46,886
- Do you ever think that?
- Oh, I get it.

778
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:50,532
Your parents
weren't good enough for you...

779
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:55,453
and now I'm not good enough for you
because Tina's a skinny dancer, right?

780
00:44:55,538 --> 00:44:57,494
- No. What?
- You know, it takes some women...

781
00:44:57,578 --> 00:45:00,729
more than a year to get back to their
normal weight after having a baby.

782
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:06,290
- You are not good B-and-B people!
- Yeah, well, that's because
we hate B-and-B's!

783
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,655
- Thanks.
- Look, we need to talk.

784
00:45:09,738 --> 00:45:15,211
- Okay.
- I'm, I'm not sure I'm ready for
an affair with a married man right now.

785
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:19,178
I'm feeling just as confused as you are,
okay? About the whole thing, all right?

786
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:21,693
I'm in the middle of a divorce.
I'm going to school at night.

787
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:23,929
You know, I need to be taken
seriously as a woman.

788
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:26,898
I want to have my own children.
I want to have my own life, you know?

789
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,859
Not just some sort of vicarious
semblance of like somebody else's life.

790
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,854
Shit.

791
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,851
- What's the matter with her?
- Hi.

792
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,729
She's upset about the way everything's
going. She's really-- Yeah.

793
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:45,609
Listen, I feel like I owe you
an apology about last night.

794
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,817
- Okay.
- Well, I mean, I think
we should discuss it...

795
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:49,971
- because, you know,
there's two sides to everything.
- Hey, you guys!

796
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:52,814
That doesn't sound
like an apology.

797
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:54,892
What the hell?

798
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:57,017
- Hey!
- Hello again, strangers.

799
00:45:57,101 --> 00:46:00,777
- Hey. Hi.
- I'm sorry that I stormed out
like that last night.

800
00:46:00,862 --> 00:46:03,501
But I suffer from hypertension.
You probably already knew that.

801
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:07,860
The whole thing was a blessing, really,
because it finally made Paul realize
how much he needs some R-and-R.

802
00:46:07,942 --> 00:46:10,979
- Sometimes you gotta be zonked
on the head. What can I say?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

803
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:13,702
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You guys are going to New Mexico?
- We're goin', yeah.

804
00:46:13,783 --> 00:46:16,661
Nothing like a cruel acceptance
of a casual invitation, right?

805
00:46:16,743 --> 00:46:19,815
- Invitation? What invitation?
- I think you were in the bathroom.

806
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,815
- Oops. Did we jump the gun here?
- No, this'll be fine.

807
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:25,019
No, wait. What do you mean
it's fine? It's fine?

808
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:27,697
- We're sightseeing.
We're not gonna get in your way.
- I'm glad to have the company.

809
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:30,901
- It's gonna be fun.
- Look, we already checked in. Why don't
I find a row for the baby, okay?

810
00:46:30,984 --> 00:46:32,895
- Terrific!
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Thanks.

811
00:46:32,984 --> 00:46:35,498
- Bye.
- We'll see you on board, Mel.

812
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,496
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't expect them to show up, honey.

813
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:41,621
- So what? You just had
a little extra hostility to work out?
- It isn't hostility.

814
00:46:41,704 --> 00:46:44,616
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- I just barely mentioned it to them.
- Right, great, great.
- Right?

815
00:46:44,704 --> 00:46:47,094
- Great, great.
- Right?
- Whatever, okay?

816
00:46:47,185 --> 00:46:50,416
I wasn't circumcised
until I was a year old.

817
00:46:50,505 --> 00:46:53,065
- Wow! Why?
- I had hypospadias.

818
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:57,343
- What is that?
- Here you are, sir.
- Well, hypospadias is like
a curvature of the penis that--

819
00:46:57,425 --> 00:46:59,814
- They have to adjust it
with a whole operation.
- Really?

820
00:46:59,905 --> 00:47:02,136
- Yeah. I had it done when I was young.
I mean, it's fine now.
- Oh, wow.

821
00:47:02,226 --> 00:47:05,821
- Here you go. Honey?
- What?
- Why don't you cover yourself, hmm?

822
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,943
I just finished nursing him, okay?

823
00:47:11,386 --> 00:47:14,298
Ever heard of hypospadias?

824
00:47:14,386 --> 00:47:17,106
Is there something wrong
with the plane?

825
00:47:19,107 --> 00:47:23,225
- How, how is the nipple irritation?
- It's really bad, actually.

826
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,218
You know why?
'Cause I, I was watching you...

827
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:28,936
and I think you might be holding him
at the wrong angle. Hey, I meant--

828
00:47:29,027 --> 00:47:31,825
- I've been doing this for a while now.
- Oh, I know you have.

829
00:47:31,907 --> 00:47:35,537
But, but, you see, when he's under,
when he's under your breast like this...

830
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:40,065
- Mm-hmm.
- and, see, he pulls down on the nipple
which obviously causes more irritation.

831
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,982
- But if you're out here and bring him
straight into the breasts--
- Uh-huh.

832
00:47:44,068 --> 00:47:49,143
- You know? I mean--
- How'd you get to be
such an expert on all this?

833
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:51,743
- I went out with a woman
who was a midwife.
- Really?

834
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:55,139
- Yeah. You have very beautiful
breasts, by the way.
- Thank you.

835
00:47:55,229 --> 00:47:57,140
I re--
I remember them from high school.

836
00:47:57,229 --> 00:48:00,187
- Do you?
- Yeah. No, not that I was
like looking at them...

837
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:02,419
but, I mean,
I just saw them in passing.

838
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:05,741
- Hey, Paul?
- Yes, here.
- Do you mind finding another seat?

839
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:10,381
- I won't look.
- No, no, no, no. We need it
for the baby to stretch out.

840
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,382
- It would really help us out.
- Oh. Another seat, huh?

841
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,745
- Yeah.
- Oh, ok-- Yeah.

842
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:19,186
- Yeah? Great.
- Thanks a million. Thanks.
- No, that's--

843
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,421
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- All right.

844
00:48:21,511 --> 00:48:24,503
- Hey, thanks for the water.
- Yeah.
- That's the headache pressure point.

845
00:48:24,591 --> 00:48:28,027
- Mmm.
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah.

846
00:48:28,111 --> 00:48:31,706
Is there something happening here
that I haven't been clued into yet?

847
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:34,988
Paul, would you mind
finding another seat?

848
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:39,463
This is wonderful. This is great.
I just-- I can't believe how naive I am.

849
00:48:39,552 --> 00:48:42,510
Sir, I can't have you moving around.
Please sit in your assigned seat, okay?

850
00:48:42,592 --> 00:48:46,267
Okay, okay.
Is anybody sitting here?

851
00:48:46,352 --> 00:48:49,662
Does anybody actually own a white
Taurus, or are they all just rentals?

852
00:48:49,752 --> 00:48:53,268
Are you kidding me? This is
the most reliable mid-size in America,
according to all the big reports.

853
00:48:53,353 --> 00:48:56,151
I'm feeling very depressed,
and I would like to talk about
what's happening here.

854
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,464
- What are you feeling depressed about?
- I feel like there's an agenda
and it's not what I had in mind.

855
00:48:59,553 --> 00:49:02,431
- What agenda?
- Well, do I have to spell it out?
I'm the fifth wheel here.

856
00:49:02,513 --> 00:49:06,062
- How do you think that makes me feel?
- We're riding in two cars until we get
to the B-and-B, Paul.

857
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:08,714
- That's not an agenda.
- Let's just hit the road, okay?

858
00:49:08,794 --> 00:49:11,388
You don't mind
if he rides with you, right?

859
00:49:11,474 --> 00:49:14,193
- Why can't he ride with you?
- See what you're doing to me?

860
00:49:14,274 --> 00:49:17,949
- Ride with us.
I don't care. Ride with us.
- Oh, that's so generous of you, Tony.

861
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:20,753
You know, I think I'll ride
with illicit couple number two.

862
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:26,507
Oh, no. He does this to me
every eight months.

863
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:29,985
-I ought to get used to it by now, but--
-What? What does he do?

864
00:49:30,075 --> 00:49:33,067
He gets antsy and he runs off
with somebody else.

865
00:49:33,155 --> 00:49:36,386
Well, I think that that's common,
you know, among certain types
of married men.

866
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:38,705
I'm the rock, he's the flake.
So that's life.

867
00:49:38,795 --> 00:49:42,914
That's exactly what my ex-husband
used to say when he was trying
to feel superior to me.

868
00:49:42,996 --> 00:49:45,066
- Tony's flights of terror
from his own life...
- Ex.

869
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:47,067
have nothing to do
with my superiority.

870
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:49,511
- Well, it's not terror
that makes people wander.
- I know.

871
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:53,987
- It's vitality.
- I see. Is it vitality that led Mel
to leave his wife for you?

872
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:56,591
- Paul, would you mind
riding in the other car?
- I don't know. I don't mind.

873
00:49:56,677 --> 00:49:58,952
- Good. Could we just pull over here?
- Yeah. I think--

874
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,187
So what happened
in the other car anyway?

875
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:03,745
Oh, Paul was probably
lecturing them, right?

876
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:07,147
No, I wasn't lecturing them.
I was asking questions. That's all.
I wasn't lecturing.

877
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,432
Oh, my God. Is that--
You brought your gun.

878
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:12,237
Absolutely I brought it. You never--
You get beeped for an emergency.

879
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,355
You know, you're such
a hopeless workaholic.
We're on vacation, for God's sake.

880
00:50:15,438 --> 00:50:18,191
- Oh, yeah, such a good time.
- No, Mel's like that too.
He cannot enjoy anything.
- You know, if you--

881
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:21,907
If you can't commit
to our marriage now, what are you
gonna do when we have a baby? Huh?

882
00:50:26,283 --> 00:50:28,752
Why can't he ride with you, huh? Hey,
you invited them in the first place.

883
00:50:28,844 --> 00:50:31,233
- Could you pass me the Baby Wipes?
- Where are you going?

884
00:50:31,324 --> 00:50:33,997
- To pee.
- You're just gonna-- Right here?

885
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:37,315
You're just gonna squat?

886
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:43,234
- Why do you have to take your keys
with you to pee anyway?
- I just wasn't thinking, okay?

887
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:45,520
It's-- I don't know how many times
I've told you to keep your keys...

888
00:50:45,605 --> 00:50:48,324
- in one place.
-Just shut up! Fuck.

889
00:50:59,005 --> 00:51:03,124
Nancy was saying you guys were having
some tension around oral sex?

890
00:51:03,206 --> 00:51:04,844
- Oh, was she?
- Yeah.
- Really?

891
00:51:04,926 --> 00:51:07,156
- Yeah. Uh-- Hey.
- Oh.
- It happens to me too, but...

892
00:51:07,246 --> 00:51:10,955
you know, a technique that I find
useful-- humming to myself.

893
00:51:11,046 --> 00:51:12,957
- Humming to yourself?
- Yep, humming.
- Really?

894
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:15,925
- Seems to release the tension so I
can enjoy the fellatio. It's great.
- Great. Great.

895
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:18,202
- Thank you. Thanks for the tip.
- You bet.
- All right.

896
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:21,085
Do you worry about the risk factor
involved in gay sex?

897
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:24,603
You know, it may be news to you, but
not every gay man has, uh, anal sex.

898
00:51:24,687 --> 00:51:26,598
That's where a lot
of the HIV risk lies.

899
00:51:26,687 --> 00:51:29,645
For example, I'm very anal. Uh, I--
I mean, in, uh, in the sense...

900
00:51:29,727 --> 00:51:33,038
that I'm compulsively careful
and clean about what touches my body.

901
00:51:33,128 --> 00:51:36,438
- Not into penetration, at all.
- To a fault.

902
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:39,042
- Okay, do we have to talk
about this right now?
- Well, why not?

903
00:51:39,128 --> 00:51:41,323
- Are you a homophobic?
- No, I--
- I think it's interesting.

904
00:51:41,408 --> 00:51:43,364
- Really? Well, I think maybe--
maybe we shouldn't.
- No, I think it's very-- Oh, God.
- Well-- Uh, no-- Uh--

905
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:47,124
- Nancy's just testing the risk
factor for sex with Tony, Mel.
- How primeval. What?

906
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:49,723
- Paul, don't patronize her.
- I'm not patronizing her.

907
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,845
She knows that I came of age
in the era of AIDS...

908
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:55,524
and even though I'm bisexual
I've been incredibly careful, okay?

909
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:58,646
- Tested negative three times
in the last seven months.
- Really?

910
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:01,197
- If I remember correctly.
Yeah, three times.
- What does that mean?

911
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:13,566
I'm sorry. Uh, maybe we should've
sprung for an updated edition, huh?

912
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,165
Hmm. I mean, uh, the picture's
right here. It was a nice B-and-B.

913
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:21,449
Yeah, they probably had something
about the uranium contamination
in the new edition. Yeah.

914
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:24,489
Did it ever occur to you
to call first? Or--

915
00:52:24,571 --> 00:52:27,529
Without spontaneity, the world
of B-and-B's is fairly meaningless.

916
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,808
Oh. Well, then, I hope you have
a tent because that's the only way
that you can be spontaneous...

917
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:32,404
in the middle of the desert
at this hour.

918
00:52:32,491 --> 00:52:34,767
Maybe Mel's parents
can suggest a place.

919
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,763
Oh, right, I'm just going to,
uh, show up with 50 people.

920
00:52:36,852 --> 00:52:39,161
''Hi. I haven't seen you for
about 30 years. This is my posse.

921
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:41,447
And, by the way, Nancy invited along
these two gay guys just for fun...

922
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:43,443
and, you know, we're gonna
be here for a while.''

923
00:52:43,532 --> 00:52:45,727
Wh-Wh-What does gay guys
have to do with anything?

924
00:52:45,812 --> 00:52:48,167
Nothing. It has nothing
to do with anything, okay?
I didn't mean to be insulting.

925
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:50,369
Then why'd you say it, neurotic guy?

926
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:54,567
- Th-That's my designation?
I'm ''neurotic guy''?
- Mm-hmm.

927
00:52:54,653 --> 00:52:57,167
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Yeah.
- I don't think you know me well
enough to call me ''neurotic guy.''

928
00:52:57,253 --> 00:52:59,323
Oh, really?
''Gay guy'' isn't intimate?

929
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:02,052
- Look, do you wanna file
an anti-defamation suit...
- There's no intimacy happening here.

930
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:04,044
or do you want to get to the
''Schwingkings''' before midnight? Okay?

931
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:06,853
Is this another surprise visit,
or did you call first this time?

932
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:10,563
- You know, I spoke with them
already. I told you that, Nancy.
- What? What?

933
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:13,009
- What?
- What, do you want to get intimate?
Is that what you're saying?

934
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,244
- Hey, the baby's going to sleep.
- Huh? No?

935
00:53:20,254 --> 00:53:24,214
- You hear that?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Lend me your comb

936
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:26,934
It's time to go home

937
00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:29,654
Gotta confess

938
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:32,044
My hair is a mess

939
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:36,886
Your mama will scold you

940
00:53:36,975 --> 00:53:39,536
Your daddy will shout

941
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,210
As we come in

942
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:45,015
The way we went out

943
00:53:46,776 --> 00:53:50,166
Kissin'you was fun
Honey bun

944
00:53:50,256 --> 00:53:52,975
Thanks for the date

945
00:53:53,056 --> 00:53:56,174
Time has come
Honey, honey bun

946
00:53:56,257 --> 00:53:59,454
You know, baby, it's a-gettin'late

947
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:02,449
Just wait till I

948
00:54:02,537 --> 00:54:04,573
Straighten my tie

949
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:07,171
Lend me your comb

950
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:09,852
We've got to go home

951
00:54:09,938 --> 00:54:14,454
- This is a long porch.
- It's a beautiful house, though.

952
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:21,377
- Sorry.
- Do you think you can wait
back in the car?

953
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,449
- Gotta go to the bathroom.
- Hi!
- Hi!

954
00:54:23,538 --> 00:54:26,133
- It's so late. We were
getting worried about you.
- I hope my directions were all right.

955
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:29,894
- Oh, they were great.
This place is so isolated.
- Oh, that's what we love about it too.

956
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:32,174
- I'm Tina Kalb.
We spoke on the phone.
- Tina.

957
00:54:32,259 --> 00:54:34,250
- Oh, yeah, right. Hi. Oh.
- We were shocked to get
your call yesterday.

958
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:38,252
- Yeah. I'm, I'm just amazed
that you ran into Fritz Boudreau
after all these years.
- Nice to meet you.

959
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:42,856
- He's something.
- Yeah. Well, he never got over
the fact that Mary left him for me.

960
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,170
Which one of you is Mel?

961
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,569
That's me.

962
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,096
- Mary Schlichting.
- Oh, so that's how you pronounce it.
- Oh!

963
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,819
- Nobody ever gets it right. Hi.
- Hi.
- And this must be your wife.

964
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,416
- Nancy.
- Nancy, hi. Welcome to our family.
- Hi. Look at the baby.

965
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:00,254
- Well, he's sleeping.
- These are our friends.

966
00:55:00,341 --> 00:55:02,855
- Uh, Tony and Paul.
- Tony.
- Paul. Mr Schlichting.

967
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:05,136
- Hello, uh, Paul. Hi.
Hello. How you doing?
- I'm Tony.

968
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:07,177
They were going to stay
at Rancho Arroyo.

969
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:11,379
- Oh, my goodness. You can't stay there.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, no. They, they
found that-- We read about that.

970
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:13,578
- Uranium, yeah.
- Uranium, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Highly toxic.

971
00:55:13,662 --> 00:55:15,937
Thank God that's far away from here.
You don't have to worry about that.

972
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,980
- Well, could you recommend a motel?
- Oh, no! No, no, no.
- Oh, no need to go to a motel.

973
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:22,691
- There isn't a decent motel
for a hundred miles.
- And we have plenty of room
here for all of you.

974
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:24,374
- Oh, thank you.
- Great.
- Sure, sure.

975
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:27,772
- I-I-I don't want everyone
to stay here with you. It's--
- Why can't everyone stay here?

976
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:31,333
- Because this is a private thing.
- You know, if I could just lay down.
I'd like to go right to bed
and put the baby to sleep.

977
00:55:31,423 --> 00:55:34,335
Sure. Let me help you. Don't you want
to eat something before you--

978
00:55:34,423 --> 00:55:38,735
- No. Thanks. I'm not hungry.
- Nancy, come on. You're always hungry.

979
00:55:38,823 --> 00:55:41,735
- Fuck you.
- What? I'm, I'm sorry?

980
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,212
It's just-- You know, this isn't
the time or the place for this, okay?

981
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:47,296
Oh, but it was the time and place
to wrestle with her...

982
00:55:47,384 --> 00:55:49,852
in San Diego, right, and break
a bunch of glass animals?

983
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:53,061
That's i-- That's fine?
That was a perfect time?

984
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:57,456
-I'm sorry, is this inappropriate?
-Nothing in this house is inappropriate.
We'll be upstairs.

985
00:55:57,544 --> 00:56:00,855
You know, I-I'll get the, the bags.
I think I want to lay down too.

986
00:56:00,945 --> 00:56:03,743
I bet you would.

987
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:07,340
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Having some problems, huh?

988
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:09,939
Yeah, we're kind of having
a little bit of a--

989
00:56:10,025 --> 00:56:13,142
- Yeah. It's, uh--
- This, uh, some kind of
a swapping thing you got here?

990
00:56:13,225 --> 00:56:16,662
- That what it is?
- No. No, no, no, no.Just, you know,
there's a little friction, that's all.

991
00:56:16,746 --> 00:56:19,704
- I mean, you know--
- And then, and, and
these guys came along with us.
- Well, you know, you know--

992
00:56:19,786 --> 00:56:23,665
- You know, marriage is tough.
You just got-- You gotta be
flexible in marriage, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

993
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:26,180
- This thing is wonderful,
by the way. Who made this?
- That's my work.

994
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:27,938
- Really? You did this? Wow.
- Yeah.

995
00:56:28,026 --> 00:56:30,745
- Yeah, I got a blacksmith shop
out in the barn, and I do
my sculptures there...
- Oh.

996
00:56:30,826 --> 00:56:33,057
- and Mary throws her pots.
- Great.

997
00:56:33,147 --> 00:56:36,662
- Really? She's into,
into pottery? Pottery?
- Oh, she's gonna love showing you
her pottery. Yeah, look at this.

998
00:56:36,747 --> 00:56:39,784
- See, this, this is slab construction.
If you can see the--
- Yeah.

999
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:42,427
Uh, when I roll it out, then I have
weeds in with the rolling pin.

1000
00:56:42,507 --> 00:56:45,021
- I press them right into the surface.
- You know, just ordinary weeds.
- You put the weeds in the clay, yeah.

1001
00:56:45,107 --> 00:56:47,416
And then when you fire it, the weed--
the weeds burn off. Here, just stick--

1002
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:49,897
- See, so where
the weeds were, you get the--
- Stick your fingers in here, you know.

1003
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:52,548
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah--
- Now, stick two fingers inside...

1004
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:54,744
- and just caress the-- That's it. Now--
- Oh, okay. There you go. Yeah.

1005
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,343
- Uh-huh. Now feel the texture
on the out-- No, against your face.
- Yeah, so it's much-- Up here.

1006
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:00,339
- That texture is--
- Oh, it's kind of--
Yeah, it's very rough.

1007
00:57:00,428 --> 00:57:02,339
- That texture is really amazing.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's great.
- It looks rough...

1008
00:57:02,428 --> 00:57:04,545
- but it's very smooth, isn't it?
- Doesn't that feel good?
Isn't it something?
- Right, right, it's smooth.

1009
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,859
- Smoother than you would think,
but, but still, still really--
- Yeah.

1010
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:10,578
This is wonderful. Great stu--
I mean, and you guys, you guys are
making a living through the arts, huh?

1011
00:57:10,669 --> 00:57:12,978
- Well, we try. We--
Sometimes you have to supplement.
- We try to, but, you know, sometimes--

1012
00:57:13,069 --> 00:57:15,708
- Yeah, you have to supplement
with other things.
- These are all mine.

1013
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:19,225
Every one of them, I made-- Oh, let--
I want to show you a big one I love.

1014
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:21,426
This environment is so much more
creative than the one I grew up in.

1015
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:24,866
- Oh, thanks. That's nice.
- It's really--
- This is a wood fire process.

1016
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:27,339
- Uh-huh. Uh, is this--
- See how this-- Hmm?

1017
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:31,059
- Who's that?
- That's our other son.

1018
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,948
- You mean I have a brother?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- You wanna say hello to Lonnie?

1019
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,660
- Yes. He's been feeling a little
threatened about meeting you,
so be patient.
- Uh-huh.

1020
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:41,664
Hi. How you doing? That's
a beautiful song you're playing there.

1021
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:48,103
- Is supper almost ready? Lonnie?
- Yeah, we better--
We better go in and, and eat.

1022
00:57:48,191 --> 00:57:51,627
He's been cooking all day.
Bagged the quail himself this morning.

1023
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:54,146
Ooh, wild quail. That's terrific.

1024
00:57:54,232 --> 00:57:56,541
Oh, you're in for a great treat.
Lonnie's a really good cook.

1025
00:57:59,712 --> 00:58:04,581
Ooh, the special son
is here tonight

1026
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:06,663
Little Cinderella oughta cook up

1027
00:58:06,752 --> 00:58:10,029
Something special for him

1028
00:58:10,113 --> 00:58:12,024
Lonnie, can you make

1029
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:15,628
Your quail tonight

1030
00:58:18,073 --> 00:58:20,109
Okay.

1031
00:58:21,433 --> 00:58:23,823
You know-- You know what I want,
I want to have happen? I want Mel--

1032
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:26,223
I want you to sit over there
next to your father.

1033
00:58:26,314 --> 00:58:28,032
- Oh, it's okay.
- Oh, it's no problem.

1034
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:30,309
Then I have all three
of my fellows in a row.

1035
00:58:30,394 --> 00:58:32,271
All right. Come on.
Come on. Come around.

1036
00:58:32,354 --> 00:58:34,948
- Um, maybe you should take
your, your plate with you.
- You don't mind, do you, Paul?
- That's all right. I didn't touch it.

1037
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:37,468
Come on, come on. Sit down.
You like quail?

1038
00:58:37,554 --> 00:58:40,513
- See?
- No, I never had quail.
- Where are you?

1039
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:42,870
You all right?

1040
00:58:42,955 --> 00:58:44,946
- I just don't wanna talk about it.
I need to calm down.
- All right.

1041
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:47,674
Well, if you do wanna talk about it,
you know, I, I wanna be here for you.

1042
00:58:47,755 --> 00:58:50,269
- Thank you.
- Want me to take care of the baby?

1043
00:58:50,355 --> 00:58:53,267
He's fine. He's sleeping.

1044
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:57,349
- Um, do you mind if I take a shower?
- No, I don't care, but could I--

1045
00:58:57,436 --> 00:58:59,745
- Could I just have a second?
- Okay.

1046
00:59:00,276 --> 00:59:03,074
So, um, Fritz said you were
a scientist, Richard.

1047
00:59:03,156 --> 00:59:07,195
Yeah, I was a-- I was a chemist
for Maple Brothers in the Bay Area
before we came out here.

1048
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:09,551
- Right, the aspirin company.
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1049
00:59:09,636 --> 00:59:13,915
Decongestants, nasal sprays, all that,
uh, you know, that consumer crap.
I couldn't wait to quit.

1050
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:16,465
- Oh, he hated it.
- Mm-hmm. I'm a scientist too.

1051
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:17,990
- No, you're kidding!
- Yeah.
- Oh, you're kidding!

1052
00:59:18,077 --> 00:59:20,591
- Oh, my God! What are you--
What's, what's your specialty?
What, what's your field?
- Entomology.

1053
00:59:20,677 --> 00:59:22,588
- No! Isn't that incredible?
- I love it.
- Yeah.

1054
00:59:22,677 --> 00:59:26,590
- A genetic connection!
- Yeah. See, that is wonderful.
- Oh, my God! That's incredible!

1055
00:59:26,677 --> 00:59:29,875
- That is wonderful.
- Oh, that's amazing.
- For some reason, Lonnie never seemed
to have an interest in science.

1056
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:32,870
- Mm, what does that mean?
- Hey, she doesn't mean anything.

1057
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:36,997
It means something that you never
had-- an interest in science.
Look at the other things you do.

1058
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:40,036
Yeah, well, who knows? I might
have had an interest in sculpture
if these guys didn't give me away.

1059
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,029
- Yeah, who knows
what might have happened?
- Yeah, I know.

1060
00:59:42,118 --> 00:59:45,998
- Give me a kiss.
- Yeah, wh-wh-wh-what did happen?

1061
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,277
- About what?
- Well, why did you guys give me up?

1062
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:52,475
Why did we give him away?

1063
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,550
- The big question.
- That's the question.

1064
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:56,675
Well, Fritz Boudreau said
that you were indisposed...

1065
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,194
and so that's how he came
to bring Mel to the agency.

1066
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,396
- ''Indisposed''? Is that what he said?
- Yeah, indisp--

1067
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,711
- That's the word Fritz used?
- That's-- That would have been nice.
- Big word for the fellow, huh?

1068
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,872
- I wouldn't mind being indisposed.
- Okay, I'm gonna tell the story.

1069
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,272
Um, how, how much detail
do you have to go into here?

1070
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,080
I want Mel to know what happened, or
he'll never believe we cared about him.

1071
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:18,471
- What are you hanging onto that for?
- You're holding onto it.

1072
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:21,553
- I'm not holding onto anything.
- I'm letting it go.
- Uh, you're holding onto these things.

1073
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:23,757
Uh, tell him. Go ahead, tell him.
I don't care. Go ahead.

1074
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:27,277
So, Mel, you know we were
living in San Francisco,
and it was the mid '60s, right?

1075
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:31,071
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- And we were part of a very
progressive group of artists...

1076
01:00:31,162 --> 01:00:35,678
- and there was one band
at the centre of it.
- A band? Wh-Wh-What band?

1077
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:38,595
Jerry Garcia, blah, blah, blah.

1078
01:00:38,682 --> 01:00:41,276
I am so sick of this fucking story!

1079
01:00:41,362 --> 01:00:44,672
It's so boring! You've been
telling it for years! Give it up!

1080
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:52,757
- He doesn't like it
when I tell this story.
- What happened with Jerry Garcia?

1081
01:00:52,843 --> 01:00:55,676
- Nothing.
- Nothing happened with Jerry Garcia,
but Richard and I went to prison--

1082
01:00:55,763 --> 01:00:58,152
-Right-- Right after you were born.
-And that's why we had to give you away.

1083
01:00:58,243 --> 01:01:01,633
- You went to prison?
- Oh, don't be stigmatized by it.

1084
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:03,840
- It wasn't a serious crime.
- Oh, God, it was nothing.

1085
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:06,233
- Not even a crime.
- It was absolutely nothing.

1086
01:01:06,324 --> 01:01:08,440
- Next to nothing, really.
- Less than nothing. Have you
ever, you know, like, driven...

1087
01:01:08,524 --> 01:01:10,833
a few miles over the speed limit,
or something like that?

1088
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:13,040
- Yeah, sure.
- It was less than that.

1089
01:01:13,124 --> 01:01:15,160
If you speed, y-you know,
you could hurt somebody.

1090
01:01:15,244 --> 01:01:17,235
- This is--
- So, were you-- you
were jailed for driving?

1091
01:01:17,324 --> 01:01:20,283
- No, no, no. No, there
was no driving. I tried--
- How did they get that?

1092
01:01:20,365 --> 01:01:23,482
I'm, I'm, I'm, uh--
I'm sorry, I'm totally lost here.

1093
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,555
- Hi.
- Hi.

1094
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:33,875
- Here, I'll get out of your way. Aah!
- Ooh.

1095
01:01:33,965 --> 01:01:36,161
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I don't know. What did I do?

1096
01:01:36,246 --> 01:01:38,680
- Oh, no, no. It's okay. Relax. Relax.
- No, watch out. You--

1097
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:41,405
- I-- You could hurt your fingers.
- Watch how you--

1098
01:01:41,486 --> 01:01:44,080
- Whoops.
- Sh--

1099
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:46,475
- I'm so clumsy.
- No, you're not.

1100
01:01:46,566 --> 01:01:48,682
You know, I have these,
uh, these, these--

1101
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:51,235
- three Italian prints
at home that I keep, uh--
- Mm-hmm.

1102
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:53,238
I don't know what to do--
if I should frame them myself...

1103
01:01:53,327 --> 01:01:56,205
- or maybe I should
take them to somebody else.
- I, uh-- I would-- I would
take them to the framer.

1104
01:01:56,287 --> 01:01:58,596
- Yeah?
- Yeah, well--

1105
01:01:58,687 --> 01:02:01,804
- So maybe that's what I'll do.
I think that-- Yeah.
- Do you want to take a shower?

1106
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:05,596
- No, go ahead.
- No, I mean together?

1107
01:02:05,687 --> 01:02:10,284
Your husband's been taking you for
granted a little bit, don't you think?

1108
01:02:10,368 --> 01:02:13,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1109
01:02:13,448 --> 01:02:15,678
Here. Let me go get
my shower cap.

1110
01:02:15,768 --> 01:02:18,487
- You made LSD? Is that--
That's what you're saying?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, but--

1111
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:22,357
- We made LSD.
- Yes, yes. We made acid.
- And we gave it out
to people who needed it.

1112
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:25,805
You know that there are
hundreds of pharmaceutical
executives in this country...

1113
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:29,723
- Oh!
- that are selling drugs,
FDA approved drugs?

1114
01:02:29,809 --> 01:02:33,563
- Oh!
- On the open market.
- Oh, on the-- Over the counter
with incredible side--

1115
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,640
- Horrible side effects.
- Terrible side effects.

1116
01:02:35,729 --> 01:02:37,641
- And these people are not in jail.
- They're not in prison anywhere.

1117
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,369
They're, they're, they're in
country clubs or playing golf.
They're having drinks.

1118
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,361
- They're running the country.
- They're not--
- They're running the country, Mel.

1119
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:45,601
- Y-You know, LSD shouldn't be
a felony in the first place.
- It's not addictive.

1120
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,681
- It doesn't lead to violent crime.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1121
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,330
- It's really the only hope
for the species.
- Yeah.

1122
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,640
D-Did you take acid while
you were pregnant with me?

1123
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,767
You're not gonna bring
that thing up, are you?

1124
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:57,649
You know the stuff
they tell you about, you know,
chromosome damage and all that stuff?

1125
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:59,847
- Yeah, I do!
- That's government propaganda.

1126
01:02:59,931 --> 01:03:02,889
- Total propaganda.
- They just want to get a hold
of your head, that's all.

1127
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:07,761
I was relieved, though,
when you came out in the hospital
and you only had one head.

1128
01:03:09,892 --> 01:03:13,009
- Very funny.
- She-- She kills me!

1129
01:03:13,092 --> 01:03:15,401
- Oh, he was such a cute baby.
- It would've been kinda nice...

1130
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:19,451
- if he had, like, a third eye
right there, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

1131
01:03:19,532 --> 01:03:22,046
- I-- M-Mel--
- You know, you know, a third eye
is a symbol of enlightenment.

1132
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,168
- You kn-- You know, he's not--
he's not, he's not getting it. He's--
- Mel.

1133
01:03:24,252 --> 01:03:27,962
- Identity is nothing
but a mental construct.
- Mental construct?

1134
01:03:28,053 --> 01:03:32,365
- You mustn't fixate on it.
- Have you ever read any Tibetan
Buddhism, like Chaos theory?

1135
01:03:32,453 --> 01:03:35,684
- Oh, Geez.
- Paul?

1136
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:39,004
- Is he okay?
- Oh!
- Are you okay there, Paul?

1137
01:03:39,093 --> 01:03:42,609
- Is this a musical table?
- ''Is this a musical table''?
- Paul, can I get you something?

1138
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:45,845
- I'm not feeling very well.
- What, what do you mean?
What is it? What, what is it?
- Let me help you. What is it?

1139
01:03:45,934 --> 01:03:48,494
- What are you going through?
- Do you want-- Do you want to lie down?
- I don't know.

1140
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:52,283
- Can, can I get you something, Paul?
- How do you feel?
- Vivid.

1141
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:56,208
- Paul? Here.
- What?
- I'm seeing colours
that I don't want to see.

1142
01:03:56,294 --> 01:03:59,253
-Did you hear that? He's seeing colours.
-Just go with it. That's all right.
He needs to lie down.

1143
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:02,611
- Wait, let me move this.
You're gonna have to help me.
- Everything's moving.

1144
01:04:02,695 --> 01:04:06,290
- Paul, can you hear me?
- Goddam it! Lonnie!

1145
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,084
- Lonnie!
- Don't fly off the handle.
- Come in here. Come here.

1146
01:04:10,175 --> 01:04:12,564
- What did you do to Paul's quail?
- Nothing. Why?

1147
01:04:12,655 --> 01:04:15,568
Come on. Don't give me that
fake innocence. What did you do?

1148
01:04:15,656 --> 01:04:18,295
I dosed Mel's dish. I meant it
for Mel, and then he ate it.

1149
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:21,493
- Oh, my God. How much?
- Two and a half tabs.

1150
01:04:21,576 --> 01:04:24,886
Two and a half tabs?
Are you crazy? Are you nuts?

1151
01:04:24,976 --> 01:04:26,932
Doesn't your mother have
enough to worry about tonight?

1152
01:04:27,016 --> 01:04:29,895
- I just don't understand this.
- Why do you ha-- Now, why do you
have to talk to me like that?

1153
01:04:29,977 --> 01:04:31,774
- Am I-- Am I talking
to him in some special way?
- It's really embarrassing to me...

1154
01:04:31,857 --> 01:04:33,768
and I really don't
appreciate it in front of him.

1155
01:04:33,857 --> 01:04:36,212
- I mean, who is he?
- What-- What's wrong with him? What--
- You got the whole
science thing going...

1156
01:04:36,297 --> 01:04:39,448
and the next thing I, I know,
you like him better than me
because he's more like you than I am.

1157
01:04:39,537 --> 01:04:43,450
- We love you very much. Even if you
were Jeffrey Dahmer, we would love you.
- Yeah, sure!

1158
01:04:43,537 --> 01:04:45,847
- Oh, you know, Mom spare me the hyp--
- Wait, I'm not here to take your place.

1159
01:04:45,938 --> 01:04:48,054
- Please, Mel, please!
- Where do you get this insecurity from?

1160
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:50,174
- I don't understand it.
This drives me nuts!
- Uh, honey?

1161
01:04:50,258 --> 01:04:52,328
- Richard, you're criticizing.
- All right, all right.

1162
01:04:52,418 --> 01:04:56,775
I want you to apologize to Mel
and to Paul right now. C'mon. C'mon.

1163
01:04:56,858 --> 01:04:59,577
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry for what?
- I'm sorry...

1164
01:04:59,658 --> 01:05:03,572
that I put windowpane in Mel's quail,
and I'm sorry that you ate it.

1165
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:06,378
All right. All right. Go sit down.
I can't believe he--

1166
01:05:06,459 --> 01:05:10,850
Let's not blow this out
of proportion, everyone. Paul's
gonna come down in about ten hours.

1167
01:05:10,939 --> 01:05:13,055
- Ten hours?
- I-- It's-- I-- It's--

1168
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:16,928
I can't believe you-- you're
actually keeping acid in the house
after you went to prison for it.

1169
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,853
- Wait till your son is 19. See if he
does everything you want him to do.
- Tina.

1170
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:23,853
- This is classic!
Yeah, just keep, uh-- keep blaming
it all on me, all your crap.
- Ah, just go with it.

1171
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:28,138
You just simmer down, you.
And you take a little responsibility
for what you've done.

1172
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,178
- Thank you, Mrs Cleaver.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- All there is.

1173
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,776
- This is a non-smoking house.
- You're gonna be all right.
- Are you kidding?
-Just go with it.

1174
01:05:34,861 --> 01:05:37,170
- We're gonna take quite a trip.
- You know, it's been a long day...

1175
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:39,252
and, uh, I'm really, really tired.

1176
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:42,139
So, uh, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna hit the hay.

1177
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:44,371
Thank you very much for, um, dinner.
It was wonderful.

1178
01:05:44,461 --> 01:05:46,850
- My love in Paris
- Shh!

1179
01:05:46,941 --> 01:05:50,059
- Knows my secret
-Just go with it.Just go with it.
- He's gonna be fine.

1180
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:52,861
- She's a great guide.
- I'm, I'm sure you are
an excellent guide.

1181
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:57,458
And I would like to thank you again
for this wonderful evening.
It was really great.

1182
01:05:57,542 --> 01:06:00,181
- It was great seeing you. Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks.
- I mean, I loved meeting you.

1183
01:06:00,262 --> 01:06:02,537
I loved meeting you too,
and I'm just gonna hit the hay.

1184
01:06:02,622 --> 01:06:04,818
- Now, you're sure
that you don't want dessert?
- Really feel awful.
- No.

1185
01:06:04,903 --> 01:06:07,701
- Um, I think I'm gonna
lay off the food, yeah.
- Close.

1186
01:06:07,783 --> 01:06:09,694
- If you get hungry later,
it's in the fridge, okay?
- Okay, good night.
Nighty-night, you two. Uh, night.

1187
01:06:09,783 --> 01:06:12,775
- Will do. Yum! Good night.
- Chocolate mousse. You're gonna
love it. You're gonna-- Yeah.

1188
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,172
- Very nice to meet you.
It was really great.
- See ya, Tina.
- Tina! Good night, Tina.

1189
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,653
- Go with it, Paul.
- I guess it's just
one of those ex-felon...

1190
01:06:18,743 --> 01:06:20,780
pro-acid kind of non-smoking homes.

1191
01:06:20,864 --> 01:06:24,095
It's a weird, weird home.
And where's Nancy? Where is she?

1192
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:28,177
- She's somewhere in one of these
rooms with Tony. They're in there--
- You know what, Mel?

1193
01:06:28,264 --> 01:06:31,176
You need to settle down.
This is overwhelming.
This is hitting you all at once.

1194
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:34,062
You know what, sweetheart? Just--
Just come in here for a second.

1195
01:06:34,144 --> 01:06:36,705
We'll just sit down, cool off a bit.

1196
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:38,776
Boy!

1197
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:41,425
Oh, boy.

1198
01:06:41,505 --> 01:06:45,020
Well, you know,
what did I expect, right?

1199
01:06:49,545 --> 01:06:51,901
I'm sorry this is all
hitting you at the same time...

1200
01:06:51,986 --> 01:06:56,502
but after it passes and things settle
down, you can think about starting over.

1201
01:06:59,986 --> 01:07:03,023
- Why can't you just use soap?
- You know, soap dries your skin out.

1202
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:07,897
Not that I'm one of those women
who obsesses about old-looking
skin after pregnancy.

1203
01:07:07,987 --> 01:07:10,865
- I just happen to be obsessing
about it right now.
- Well--

1204
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:14,337
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You know, you're absolutely right.
We don't need to rush into this.

1205
01:07:14,427 --> 01:07:16,702
- I haven't even
finalized my divorce yet.
- No, I could've kissed you just now...

1206
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:20,496
and felt okay about it, but I didn't,
and I felt really wrong.

1207
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:24,582
Don't take this personally,
but with all your nervous energy...

1208
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:27,626
you kinda remind me
of my mother. Ow!

1209
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:30,700
- Do you mind if I look at your armpit?
- My armpit?

1210
01:07:30,788 --> 01:07:33,905
Yeah, it's my favourite part of
a woman's body. I mean, it-- May I?

1211
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:36,297
- What's attractive about an armpit?
- Are you kidding? Lots of things.

1212
01:07:36,388 --> 01:07:40,143
Look at this, the definition.
Look at the contours here.

1213
01:07:40,229 --> 01:07:43,539
The depth of the pocket.
Feel that? So nice.

1214
01:07:43,629 --> 01:07:46,302
- Of course I feel rejected.
- I'm sorry.

1215
01:07:46,389 --> 01:07:49,586
But I shouldn't. You're not
an appropriate partner for me.

1216
01:07:49,669 --> 01:07:53,025
Your life's a mess, and you
don't make enough money anyway.

1217
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:55,419
That's a really nasty thing to say.

1218
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:58,024
You just told me
I reminded you of your mother.

1219
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,147
Well, she's-- I mean,
she's a good person.
She's got a lot of great qualities.

1220
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:03,266
Uh, uh--

1221
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:10,421
I don't want to wreck your marriage.
I know how painful that that can be.

1222
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:13,708
My marriage is obviously
vulnerable at this point.

1223
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:16,100
Every marriage is vulnerable,
otherwise being married...

1224
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:18,705
wouldn't mean anything, would it?

1225
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,422
- Paul.
- Tony. I need to see Tony.
- No, I want you to--

1226
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:27,026
- I want you to tell me if
you have a favourite animal.
- Oh, that's so stupid.

1227
01:08:27,112 --> 01:08:30,229
Listen to what Mary says. She's
a great guide, okay? Just listen to her.

1228
01:08:30,312 --> 01:08:32,109
- Okay.
- What's your--
- A dog.

1229
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:35,229
- A dog. Uh, what is your favourite dog?
- A coll-- St Bernard. St Bernard.

1230
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:39,305
St Bernard. Good. I want you
to picture a big, furry St Bernard
curled up by the fireplace.

1231
01:08:39,392 --> 01:08:42,111
- Can I change my mind? Yeah.
- No, no, we're-- we're gonna
stick with the St Bernard.

1232
01:08:42,192 --> 01:08:44,502
- I want to do a Springer Spaniel.
- No, it doesn't have to be
the perfect dog.

1233
01:08:44,593 --> 01:08:47,426
- Uh, Dalmatian. Dal--
- No, no, no. D--

1234
01:08:47,513 --> 01:08:51,631
- Okay, Dalmatian. Now,
this dog represents security--
- Schnauzer.

1235
01:08:51,713 --> 01:08:53,908
- What?
- Schnauzer.
- Shut the fuck up!

1236
01:08:53,993 --> 01:08:57,190
- I am trying to help you.
Do you understand me?
- Hey, come on, sweetheart.

1237
01:08:57,273 --> 01:09:01,153
- You're so good.Just relax, okay?
Just take it easy now. Take it easy.
- Okay. Okay, okay. Paul! Paul!

1238
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:04,670
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1239
01:09:04,754 --> 01:09:07,143
Can we stop
all this craziness, huh?

1240
01:09:07,234 --> 01:09:10,670
- Yes! I wasn't even enjoying that.
- It seems like you were enjoying it.

1241
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:14,464
- The attention, maybe, but--
- Okay. All right.
Time for you to go, okay?

1242
01:09:14,555 --> 01:09:16,989
You haven't been treating her very well.
Do you know that?

1243
01:09:17,075 --> 01:09:19,908
Oh, uh-- You know what? You know what,
buddy? You know, you got a lot of nerve.

1244
01:09:19,995 --> 01:09:22,304
You come in here,
you lick my wife's armpit.

1245
01:09:22,395 --> 01:09:25,387
You know, you-- I, uh, uh, uh--
I'm gonna have that image in my head...

1246
01:09:25,475 --> 01:09:29,707
- for the rest of my life of your tongue
in there. I-- It's, it's, it's--
- You deserve it.

1247
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:31,707
- This is felonious,
and I want to make an arrest.
- Warm him up.

1248
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:34,390
- Shh!
- What? What he say?
- He's tripping his brains out.

1249
01:09:34,476 --> 01:09:37,468
- He doesn't know who he is.
- Did he say-- he say-- He said
arrest. What do you mean he--
We don't know who he is.

1250
01:09:37,556 --> 01:09:41,469
- He's Mel's friend Paul.
- I know exactly who I am.
I'm Paul Harmon.

1251
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:44,468
- Good.
- Bureau of Tobacco, Tobacco,
and Tobacco.

1252
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:47,196
- Good. What is this, Paul?
- It is a badge.

1253
01:09:47,277 --> 01:09:49,347
- What kind of badge?
- I'm a Special Agent man.

1254
01:09:49,437 --> 01:09:54,033
Twenty years in the service.
Graduated fourth in my class.

1255
01:09:54,117 --> 01:09:56,790
- Is this a-- Is this a joke?
- I don't joke about those things.
- Goddam it.

1256
01:09:56,877 --> 01:10:00,108
- I knew it was weird.
I knew it. When they called up
out of the blue like that, I knew.
- He's--

1257
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:03,827
- No, you had to see your son.
- He's kidding. He's making a joke.
He's just-- Oh.

1258
01:10:03,918 --> 01:10:06,671
- You're not kidding. Shit.
- I am not kidding.
Everything is under control.
- Okay. All right.

1259
01:10:06,758 --> 01:10:10,592
All right. I want you to both move over
against that wall. This is an arrest.

1260
01:10:10,678 --> 01:10:13,067
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

1261
01:10:13,158 --> 01:10:15,592
If you cannot afford an attorney,
we will provide an attorney for you...

1262
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:18,591
because we provide things
for you people all the--

1263
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:20,988
Oh! That really hurt.

1264
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,111
I can't follow your fickle
little moods all over the place.

1265
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:28,235
- That has got to change.
- Okay, I will. I promise.

1266
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:30,514
If you just give me a chance,
let me show you I can be less selfish.

1267
01:10:30,599 --> 01:10:33,272
I-- I-I will show you.
You will get concrete results.

1268
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:36,477
You have got to earn that back
with some consistent behaviour, pal.

1269
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,677
Look, I'm sorry I acted this way.
I'm sorry I've treated you this way.

1270
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,228
I-- I've got to be out of my mind
to risk losing you.

1271
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,515
- You don't hit another human being!
- Will you be quiet!
- My-- Goddam it!

1272
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,433
Just shut the hell up!
Just be quiet.

1273
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,718
All right, nobody heard us
upstairs. We're all right.

1274
01:10:50,801 --> 01:10:52,917
- We have to get him to a doctor.
- Oh, no. There's no doctor.
Forget the doctor.

1275
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:55,799
- What, no doctor? He's hurt. Paul.
- I've gotta think of what
we're gonna do.Just give me a minute.

1276
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:58,236
- Paul, wake up. Wake up, Paul.
- I'm not-- I'm not goin' back to jail.
I'm not going back to jail.

1277
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:00,960
- Paul, wake up.
- You know where I'm goin'? I'm goin'
to Mexico. We're all goin' to Mexico.

1278
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:03,635
- And we're taking him as a hostage.
- A hostage?

1279
01:11:03,721 --> 01:11:06,759
- Cool!
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not going to jail again.

1280
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:09,037
- You understand me?
I'm not going to jail!
- Oh, my God.

1281
01:11:09,122 --> 01:11:11,761
This has to be a mistake.
Mel wouldn't do this to us.

1282
01:11:11,842 --> 01:11:15,152
- How do you know it's Mel?
How do you know who Mel is?
Mel is probably in on this. Mel--
- He's a-- He's a pig!

1283
01:11:15,242 --> 01:11:18,279
How do you know it's our son?
It's not our son. It's some
fucking Federal Agent!

1284
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:20,353
- Goddam it.
- I know it's our son. I can tell.

1285
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:23,515
- Uh, w--
- You think a mother
doesn't know these things?
-Just shut up for a minute and listen.

1286
01:11:23,603 --> 01:11:26,163
We're gonna take him in the car,
then we go down to San Miguel
to Stuart's place.

1287
01:11:26,243 --> 01:11:28,632
- We can be there by morning.
Grab his foot. This guy is--
- Paul, wake-- No!

1288
01:11:28,723 --> 01:11:32,432
No. I am not walking away from a home
that took us 20 years to put together.

1289
01:11:32,523 --> 01:11:35,481
- This guy is--
- No!
- The wheel barrow.
- This is insane.

1290
01:11:35,563 --> 01:11:39,477
We can't take him hostage.
This is a much bigger crime.

1291
01:11:39,564 --> 01:11:42,158
- Well, what'll we do?
What'll-- What'll we do with him?
- Dump-- Dump him in the brush.

1292
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:44,633
- Brush! Good, good.
- Leave him and get outta here.

1293
01:11:44,724 --> 01:11:48,194
- Lonnie.
- Yeah.
- Go clean out the lab.
- Right.

1294
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:50,923
Don't break anything!

1295
01:12:11,246 --> 01:12:13,282
No, no, no.
Wai-- Wait a minute.

1296
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:16,358
Shit! This truck is not going
to make it to Mexico.

1297
01:12:16,446 --> 01:12:19,199
- So what are we--
- Oh, shit!

1298
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,123
Put it in here.

1299
01:12:45,688 --> 01:12:48,486
My sciatica is killing me.

1300
01:12:48,568 --> 01:12:50,479
Would've been here an hour ago
if you'd listened to me.

1301
01:12:50,568 --> 01:12:53,605
It took two hours to find
that there's no place to get
a good sandwich around here.

1302
01:12:53,688 --> 01:12:56,726
You can't keep making U-turns
in the middle of a highway, Eddie...

1303
01:12:56,809 --> 01:12:59,607
- even if you see what
looks like a sandwich shop.
- Let's get this over with.

1304
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:03,079
Eddie-- Eddie, wait. Don't.

1305
01:13:03,169 --> 01:13:05,808
What's the matter?
Come on!

1306
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:10,087
- I can't go in there.
- Why not?

1307
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:12,684
- Look at this house.
- What's the matter with it?

1308
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:16,649
Well, it's so all-American. It's--

1309
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:19,528
- What are you talking about?
- Well, they're probably...

1310
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:22,124
quiet, reasonable,
sensible people...

1311
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:24,678
and Mel loves them,
and, you know, we're neur--

1312
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:27,682
- And he-- We're a source
of embarrassment to him.
- But he's in trouble...

1313
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,604
and that's why we came!

1314
01:13:30,691 --> 01:13:34,764
- It's possible I overreacted.
- Now you think you overreacted?

1315
01:13:34,851 --> 01:13:36,603
- Yeah. We--
- We just got off an aeroplane.

1316
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:38,409
- We drove five and a half
hours in the desert...
- Listen, Eddie...

1317
01:13:38,491 --> 01:13:41,289
- and you're telling me
that you overreacted?
- I am not going in there to be
rejected in front of his new parents!

1318
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:43,805
- Yes, you are! Come on. Pearl.
- No, I'm not. Let go of me.

1319
01:13:43,891 --> 01:13:45,325
- Come on, Pearl.
- You're hurting my arm.

1320
01:13:45,412 --> 01:13:47,323
- You feel that?
- Get in the car before they hear us.

1321
01:13:47,412 --> 01:13:50,290
- I thought we were gonna eat here.
I'm starving.
- We'll go back to the taco place.

1322
01:13:50,372 --> 01:13:53,808
- Tacos have cheese in them.
- Not all tacos have
cheese in them, Eddie.

1323
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:56,326
- Wait, is this our car?
- Of course it's our car.

1324
01:13:56,412 --> 01:14:01,646
- Do you remember this truck?
- What, do you have early Alzheimer's?
It's a white rental car--

1325
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:18,529
- Where's the car?
- It's over here.
What's the matter with you?

1326
01:14:18,614 --> 01:14:20,684
- Why did you move it?
- I thought you moved it.

1327
01:14:20,774 --> 01:14:23,811
- Why would I move it?
- I don't know, Dad.
- What are we taking that car for?

1328
01:14:23,894 --> 01:14:25,805
- I wanna take the blue truck.
- No, no, we can't take the truck.

1329
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:29,170
- The truck can't make an 800-mile trip.
- Oh, no. My blue truck.
I want my blue truck.

1330
01:14:29,254 --> 01:14:32,008
- Mom, come o-- come on!
- But my water broke in this truck.

1331
01:14:32,095 --> 01:14:35,690
Get in the car.
I love you. Get in the car.

1332
01:14:35,775 --> 01:14:39,848
Are you sure
all your doubting is over?

1333
01:14:39,935 --> 01:14:43,530
I'm sorry I took you for granted.
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1334
01:14:47,135 --> 01:14:49,127
I want to go home tomorrow.

1335
01:14:49,216 --> 01:14:53,209
So do I.
I want to get out of here.

1336
01:15:13,017 --> 01:15:15,850
- Slow down. There's the taco place.
- Why didn't you tell me you saw it?

1337
01:15:15,937 --> 01:15:18,292
I did tell you.
You were driving too fast.

1338
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:20,938
You can't make U-turns
like this, Eddie.

1339
01:15:21,018 --> 01:15:23,976
- Relax. We're in the middle of nowhere.
- The, the sign!

1340
01:15:24,058 --> 01:15:27,494
The sign, the sign! The--
Aah! The car!

1341
01:15:29,018 --> 01:15:31,088
Goddam tourists! Shit!

1342
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:34,534
- What did I just tell you
about the U-turns?
- He was in my blind spot.

1343
01:15:34,618 --> 01:15:38,248
You could fit the state
of Wisconsin in your blind spot.

1344
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:41,331
-It's their fault. They're in the wrong.
-Doesn't matter. I don't want
some sheriff to come by here.

1345
01:15:41,419 --> 01:15:44,252
- Wh-Where's the-- Where's the acid?
- It's in the trunk, Dad. Yeah.
- It's in the trunk?

1346
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:48,412
Look. Look, if things
get tight, I want you to do
that spastic colon thing you do.

1347
01:15:48,499 --> 01:15:50,694
-No, no, I'm not gonna do spastic colon.
-Okay, now, do-- something.

1348
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:55,217
That thing you did when the cops
stopped us in Albuquerque, you know?
That, that, what, that ulcer thing.

1349
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,339
- Um-- Uh, okay, I-- I'll do reflux.
- All right. That's good. Okay.

1350
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:07,659
- I am so sorry!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

1351
01:16:07,741 --> 01:16:09,697
You can't just make
a blind U-turn like that.

1352
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:12,420
I've got a sizable blind spot,
is my problem.

1353
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,334
- Well, I don't see much damage here.
- No, it looks mostly cosmetic.

1354
01:16:15,421 --> 01:16:17,810
- Yeah. It's nothing. Why don't we
just forget about it, all right?
- No, no.

1355
01:16:17,901 --> 01:16:21,052
Well, I don't know. We shouldn't
leave the scene of an accident. I'll
call the police from the taco place.

1356
01:16:21,141 --> 01:16:23,098
Well, you can call the police
if you want to, but, I mean...

1357
01:16:23,182 --> 01:16:25,491
I-I'll tell you right now,
this, this is your fault here.

1358
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:29,621
I mean, if we make a report, y-your
insurance rates are gonna go sky-high.

1359
01:16:29,702 --> 01:16:33,217
- I mean, it's up to you, but, I mean,
I don't, I don't see the point of it.
- Uh, Pearl, he's making sense.

1360
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:37,136
No! I have never broken the law.
I am not going to be irresponsible now.

1361
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:40,533
- Yeah, there's nothing
irresponsible about this.
- No, absolutely. We're all fine.

1362
01:16:40,623 --> 01:16:42,739
There's-- You can see
that we're perfectly okay.

1363
01:16:42,823 --> 01:16:46,099
I, uh, I, I just have this
preexisting medical condition.

1364
01:16:46,183 --> 01:16:49,459
My ileocecal valve is, uh--
doesn't work as it should.

1365
01:16:49,543 --> 01:16:52,011
And it allows c-corrosive juices--

1366
01:16:52,103 --> 01:16:54,937
They seem to rise up
into my oesophagus, and I--

1367
01:16:55,024 --> 01:16:58,334
I, I, I need to get home
so that I can lie down and--

1368
01:16:58,424 --> 01:17:02,542
- We, we really have to go.
- With my head elevated.

1369
01:17:02,624 --> 01:17:05,661
- Ileocecal valve?
- It's chronic.
- Nice meeting you.

1370
01:17:05,744 --> 01:17:08,656
Why did you let them get away?

1371
01:17:08,744 --> 01:17:11,339
We're better off.
Who knows what our liability is?

1372
01:17:11,425 --> 01:17:16,180
Y-Yes! What, what exactly is
our deductible damage waiver?

1373
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:18,733
Here-- Oh, my God!

1374
01:17:18,825 --> 01:17:22,215
- The car-- it's registered to Mel!
- What?

1375
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:26,344
Look at the-- Check and see
if our luggage is in the trunk.

1376
01:17:32,826 --> 01:17:34,862
Huh?

1377
01:17:36,706 --> 01:17:39,015
What the hell is this?

1378
01:17:47,387 --> 01:17:51,460
Sometimes the light's
all shining on me

1379
01:17:53,707 --> 01:17:57,825
Other times, I can barely see

1380
01:17:57,907 --> 01:18:00,263
- So then what happened?
- I don't know--
I don't know where anybody is.

1381
01:18:00,348 --> 01:18:02,543
- I mean, I assume-- I mean,
look at this place. It's a wreck.
- Well, I see the place.

1382
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:04,823
- I-I guess they probably-- Well, then--
- And I'm looking for him,
and I can't find him.

1383
01:18:04,908 --> 01:18:09,140
- So where--
- They probably took him to
the hospital, Tony. I mean, he, he was--

1384
01:18:09,228 --> 01:18:12,777
They didn't take him
to the hospital. Look. Paul!

1385
01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:15,224
Oh, my God!

1386
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:20,544
- Truckin', I'm a-going home
- You can't catch the wind!

1387
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:23,063
Whoa, whoa, baby
back where I belong

1388
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:25,458
-Jerry? W--
- Mm-hmm.

1389
01:18:25,549 --> 01:18:27,460
-Jerry Garcia Jerry?
- Yeah!

1390
01:18:27,549 --> 01:18:30,428
I mean, it's in the family.
It's got a whole history to it.

1391
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:32,899
You don't even like
the Grateful Dead.

1392
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:36,187
I never said I don't like them.
I just haven't ever listened to
that much of their music.

1393
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:38,226
Unless you still like Ethan.

1394
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:42,189
This is obviously much more important
to you than it is to me.

1395
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:45,342
Okay? So you pick the name.
But I'll just say one thing.

1396
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:47,706
- What?
- I think Jerry is very pedestrian.

1397
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:50,100
How 'bout Garcia?

1398
01:18:50,191 --> 01:18:52,785
- Garcia?
- Garcia Coplin.

1399
01:18:52,871 --> 01:18:56,102
Garcia! Garcia Coplin.

1400
01:18:56,191 --> 01:18:58,421
- Look. Look, he likes it.
- I like it too.

1401
01:18:58,511 --> 01:19:01,105
- Garcia Coplin.
- Yeah.

1402
01:19:01,191 --> 01:19:03,308
- Garcia.
- Yeah.

1403
01:19:05,592 --> 01:19:08,390
- You think I should get that?
- Sure.

1404
01:19:10,992 --> 01:19:13,381
Hello? Shit-- Shitkings--

1405
01:19:13,472 --> 01:19:16,305
- Schlichting.
- Schlichtings' residence.

1406
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:19,147
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- Us? We're not in trouble.
You're the ones who're in jail.

1407
01:19:19,233 --> 01:19:21,952
There were drugs in the trunk
of your car. Why are there
drugs in the trunk of your car?

1408
01:19:22,033 --> 01:19:24,422
- How did you get our car?
- We tracked you to the ''Shitkings''...

1409
01:19:24,513 --> 01:19:26,708
-Will you-- Will you hurry.
-because we thought you were in trouble.

1410
01:19:26,793 --> 01:19:29,261
- Well, why did you think
we were in trouble?
- Because of the phone call.

1411
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:34,064
- The truck and the baby.
- Oh, no-- No, Ma, I was talking to that
evil little dwarf woman at the B-and-B.

1412
01:19:34,154 --> 01:19:37,112
- We wer-- We weren't in trouble.
- Oh.
- Your mother as usual has overreacted.

1413
01:19:37,194 --> 01:19:39,788
- I did not overreact, Eddie!
If I overreacted...
- Well, you said in front of--

1414
01:19:39,874 --> 01:19:43,071
why am I wearing handcuffs
in the middle of a jail?

1415
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:46,749
Th-There's obviously
been some mishap, sir.
These people are not drug runners.

1416
01:19:46,834 --> 01:19:49,747
I mean, look at them.
They're, they're from New York.
They're, they're my parents.

1417
01:19:49,835 --> 01:19:51,951
You hear that, Eddie?
He called us his parents.

1418
01:19:52,035 --> 01:19:54,549
Of course you're
my parents. Mom--

1419
01:19:54,635 --> 01:19:57,024
Oh, Mel.

1420
01:19:57,115 --> 01:19:59,549
- Ow, Ma, your chain's
pulling on my hair.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

1421
01:19:59,635 --> 01:20:01,865
Sorry, darling.

1422
01:20:01,955 --> 01:20:04,867
Bobby, take these forms back
to the office, these release forms.

1423
01:20:04,955 --> 01:20:08,266
And get these nice people their
car keys. This is all over here.

1424
01:20:08,356 --> 01:20:11,587
This is a Federal agent here,
and he just told me the whole story
about the ''Shlytings.''

1425
01:20:11,676 --> 01:20:14,190
- ''Schlitinooks.''
- ''Shitkings.''
- No, Schlichtings.

1426
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:17,074
Well, anyway, it's clear
that we have the wrong people here.

1427
01:20:17,156 --> 01:20:20,944
- They found--
- That's what I've been trying to tell
this guy for the last half hour.
- Thank God for this Federal agent.

1428
01:20:21,036 --> 01:20:24,791
And by the way, w-w-why
are you not wearing pants?

1429
01:20:24,877 --> 01:20:27,516
- I had an experience, that's why.
- What do you mean?

1430
01:20:27,597 --> 01:20:32,751
I resisted at first, and then it evolved
and it continues to evolve for me.

1431
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:36,307
I don't know what the hell
he's talking about, but I got some
jewellery somewhere, if you please.

1432
01:20:36,397 --> 01:20:39,071
- A diamond and some turquoise.
- Yes, ma'am. Sure, just let me
get those cuffs for you.

1433
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:43,311
I don't know. We may be able
to work out a private adoption
through some people I know in Colorado.

1434
01:20:43,398 --> 01:20:46,629
- How long will that take?
- Usually six to-- months
to a year. I don't know.

1435
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:49,676
But if you're willing to wait,
you know, I may be able to find
a couple of lesbians...

1436
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:51,953
- who would be willing to conceive...
- That's good. Lesbians are good.

1437
01:20:52,038 --> 01:20:55,190
- and then you could share
the baby with them.
- No way. I'm not gonna do that.
- No? Why?

1438
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:59,192
- I think these two are homosexuals.
- They want to adopt a kid.
That's so sick.

1439
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:02,794
Can you imagine the neurosis
that child would be exposed to?

1440
01:21:02,879 --> 01:21:04,949
- Okay. Okay, here we go.
- Okay.

1441
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:07,348
- Everyone, pull together. Paul, smile.
- Are we ready? Okay.

1442
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:09,749
One, two!

1443
01:21:35,241 --> 01:21:39,075
- Yo, ye pharaohs, let us walk
- Are you okay?

1444
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:42,074
Through this barren desert
in search of truth

1445
01:21:42,162 --> 01:21:46,235
And some pointy boots
and maybe a few snack crackers

1446
01:21:49,162 --> 01:21:52,711
Baby, you make me wanna walk

1447
01:21:52,802 --> 01:21:54,918
- All right. All right.
- Like a camel

1448
01:21:55,002 --> 01:21:57,915
- Why do we have to baby-sit tonight?
- Oh, sweetie.

1449
01:21:58,003 --> 01:22:01,712
- Come on, come on. Ahh, yes.
- All right. Shh.

1450
01:22:01,803 --> 01:22:04,033
Okay. Here. That's-- Oh, I know--

1451
01:22:04,123 --> 01:22:07,081
- Because the kids need some time alone.
- The kids need time alone?

1452
01:22:07,163 --> 01:22:11,600
Yes! God, Eddie,
where's your sense of romance?

1453
01:22:16,884 --> 01:22:18,681
Who's in charge here

1454
01:22:18,764 --> 01:22:21,403
- Where's my captain's wafers
- I can't, I can't.
It's making me too nervous.

1455
01:22:21,484 --> 01:22:25,159
- Oh, it made you nervous when he
was in the other room. Come on.
- Okay.

1456
01:22:25,244 --> 01:22:27,633
- Maybe next--
- Will you relax, please?

1457
01:22:27,724 --> 01:22:29,681
- Is that my beeper?
- No, that's not your beeper.

1458
01:22:29,765 --> 01:22:32,518
- Let's get this beeper
and this gun out of here.
- No, my gun--

1459
01:22:32,605 --> 01:22:35,199
Wanna walk

1460
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:37,435
Like a camel

1461
01:22:39,525 --> 01:22:42,358
It's a blind date. I don't know.
Some benefit or something.

1462
01:22:42,445 --> 01:22:45,324
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1463
01:22:45,406 --> 01:22:47,966
No, I am not smoking, Mother.
Look, I gotta go.

1464
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:52,085
He's here.
Yeah, he knows. Mm-hmm.

1465
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:55,636
Yeah, I know.
I'll call you tomorrow. Uh-- Uh-huh.

1466
01:22:55,726 --> 01:22:58,923
Pain in my ass.
I'm coming!

1467
01:22:59,006 --> 01:23:02,886
Say, you don't think there's, uh
any way I can get that quarter

1468
01:23:02,967 --> 01:23:06,642
From underneath
of your pointy boot, do you
All I want--

1469
01:23:06,727 --> 01:23:09,924
- Shalom, shalom.
- Shalom, shalom.

1470
01:23:10,007 --> 01:23:12,521
Shalom. Deeper.

1471
01:23:12,607 --> 01:23:16,044
You guys, this place sucks.
Everybody speaks Spanish.

1472
01:23:16,128 --> 01:23:18,642
- Did you ever hear of knocking?
- What are you looking for?

1473
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:20,844
- I'm looking for some weed.
- No, you find your own weed.

1474
01:23:20,928 --> 01:23:23,567
- Get out of that drawer.
- You guys, I'm totally bored here.

1475
01:23:23,648 --> 01:23:27,482
Honey-- Honey, it takes time
to make new friends. Be patient.

1476
01:23:29,448 --> 01:23:32,088
Say, you don't think
there's, uh, any way

1477
01:23:32,169 --> 01:23:36,879
I could get that quarter from underneath
of your pointy boot, do you

1478
01:23:36,969 --> 01:23:40,245
All I want is
just one more oatmeal pie
