00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,458
(GIRL MOANING)

2
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,868
<i>Come inside, take off your coat.</i>

3
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,095
<i>I'll make you feel at home</i>

4
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,138
(GIRL BREATHING HEAVILY)

5
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,763
<i>Now let's pour a glass of wine</i>

6
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,172
<i>'Cause now we're all alone</i>

7
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,678
(GIRL CONTINUES MOANING)

8
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,446
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:56,288 --> 00:00:59,382
<i>Girl you make me feel real good.</i>

10
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,924
NOAH: That's right.

11
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:03,283
What's up?

12
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:05,226
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,663
My mom was so right.

14
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,961
Nice guys really do eat the best pussy.

15
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,367
I'm not really sure how to
interpret that. Thank you?

16
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,597
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

17
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,640
How are you so good at that?

18
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,299
I'll let you in on a trade secret.

19
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,173
I actually write a short story
with my tongue every time I do it.

20
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:22,280
It follows this young kid

21
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:26,044
who finds this alien in the woods
with all these Reese's Pieces and stuff.

22
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,210
And he learns that
aliens are just no different.

23
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,446
You just can connect with anyone.

24
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:33,685
It's kind of like <i>E.T.,</i>
only with a lot more going down on chicks.

25
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,987
- Cool beans.
- Yeah, cool beans.

26
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,064
- Definitely. Cool little frozen beans.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:40,893
All right, so...

28
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,967
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:44,729
Yeah, we should...

30
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,838
- We should probably...
- Yeah, you should probably go.

31
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,270
Switch places.

32
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,739
What's that?

33
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,236
(LAUGHS)

34
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,935
- I figured...
- Don't you have to go?

35
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:58,073
No, no, I just figured
because I made "mouth love" to you

36
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:02,483
that maybe you could
(CLICKS TONGUE) return the favor.

37
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:05,789
- What?
- Maybe toss a BJ my way.

38
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,586
If you have time.

39
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:10,422
My stomach is super-iffy right now.

40
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:14,089
I think I got food poisoning.

41
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,666
Baby.

42
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:20,432
So I'm just in no condition
to blow you right now, Noah.

43
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,404
- No, yeah, that's cool.
- Okay.

44
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,339
Sorry. Next time, sweetie.

45
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,973
Are you sure you don't want
to come over tonight?

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,048
There's this thing called
a geomagnetic storm.

47
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:33,209
It's really cool and rare, actually.

48
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,880
It's like an astronomical explosion
in the sky of all these beautiful colors.

49
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:38,820
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

50
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:42,758
Kind of like Mother Nature's fireworks.
It happens, like, almost never.

51
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,556
Like I said, I'm just not feeling good.

52
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:46,858
But thank you so much
for going down on me.

53
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:51,300
Oh, yeah. You're really good at
getting going down on,

54
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:53,200
getting downed on,

55
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:56,138
- so you should be proud of that as well.
- Okay, cool. You da man!

56
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:57,572
You da man.

57
00:02:57,676 --> 00:03:00,076
Peace. You're the best, sweetie.

58
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,238
Don't stop believing in yourself,
okay, Maris?

59
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:07,644
<i>Uncle Ricky, could you read us</i>
<i>a bedtime story?</i>

60
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:09,584
<i>Please, huh, please?</i>

61
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,920
<i>Here we go.</i>

62
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,085
<i>Once upon a time, not long ago.</i>

63
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,629
<i>Where people wore pajamas</i>
<i>and lived life slow.</i>

64
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,892
<i>Where laws were stern</i>
<i>and justice stood.</i>

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,161
<i>And people were behavin'</i>
<i>like they ought to good.</i>

66
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:25,361
<i>There lived a little boy</i>

67

<i>By another little boy</i>

<i>Me and you Tike</i>
<i>We're gonna make some cash.</i>

69

71
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,039
<i>But one couldn't stop</i>
<i>It's like he had a disease.</i>

72
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:39,583
<i>He robbed another and another</i>
<i>and a sister and a brother.</i>

73
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,949
<i>Tried to rob a man</i>
<i>who was a D.T. Undercover.</i>

74
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,181
<i>The cop grabbed his arm</i>
<i>He started actin' erratic.</i>

75
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:46,587
<i>He said, "Keep still boy,
no need for static"</i>

76
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,886
<i>Punched him in his belly</i>

<i>But little did he know</i>
<i>The little boy was strapped.</i>

78
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,831
<i>The kid pulled outta gun</i>
<i>He said, "Why'd you hit me?"</i>

79
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,957
<i>The barrel was set straight</i>
<i>for the cop's kidney.</i>

80
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,400
<i>Ran up the stairs</i>

81

<i>Opened up a door, there

82

<i>Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope.</i>

<i>Just another case

- Yo, Mom, what's up?
- Noah!

91
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:29,892
Where were you?
Were you out with that girl again?

92
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,560
Yeah, but she's not "that girl," okay?

93
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,900
We're in a relationship. It's legit.

94
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,065
So have you started looking for a job yet?

95
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,735
I can't afford to have you
sitting around all day.

96
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:43,679
You're in a period of stasis.
Just a stage of stasis.

97
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:47,513
- NOAH: Sorry. <i>- You sure you
don't want that beer now?</i>

98
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,644
<i>Or maybe something stronger?</i>
<i>I have absinthe.</i>

99
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,313
Why can't we hit up Dad?
He owes us 10 years of alimony.

100
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,686
Oh, look, kiddo.

101
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,954
If you're looking for a handout,
think again times 10.

102
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:59,462
That guy's a diamond dealer.
He has crazy cash.

103
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,123
Why'd you marry such an A-hole?

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,200
That A-hole gave me the greatest gift
in the world.

105
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,462
Crabs?

106
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,604
He gave me you.

107
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:09,697
- Okay.
- (LAUGHS)

108
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:10,934
So, tell me, what do you think?

109
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,476
- Do I look okay?
- You look amazing.

110
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,443
Why are you so concerned with your outfit?

111
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:16,343
Mrs. Pedulla is introducing me to a surgeon

112
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,383
- at the fundraiser at the Historical Society.
- Okay.

113
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,985
- She thinks we're going to hit it off.
- Nice.

114
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:22,951
Well, don't give it up too easily.

115
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,386
- Give what up?
- What?

116
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,354
- Give what up?
- What did...

117
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,960
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I don't know.

118
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,551
- Have fun. I love you. Okay?
- I love you.

119
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,127
(KISSING)

120
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,729
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah.

121
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,664
I think you're going to
have a really great night,

122
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,736
and you look beautiful.

123
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,839
Oh. From your lips to God's ears.

124

129
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,910
Mom, the phone's ringing!

130
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,385
Noah, please get the phone!

131
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,718
Mom, the phone's ringing! Do you hear it?

132
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:03,021
Noah, can't you think about
somebody else besides yourself for once?

133
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,095
No, I totally was.
That's why I said the phone was ringing.

134
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,424
I was letting you know that it was ringing.

135

Yeah. I'm thrilled about tonight.

NOAH: They perfected the pancake?

What? Why?

The Pedullas' sitter canceled
at the last minute.

146

What?

147

Do I have shit on my face?

Come on.
Don't tell me you can't use the money.

Are you crazy? No. I'm not Mary Poppins.

I'm not gonna be a babysitter.
I'm an adult man.

Okay? Babysitting sucks.
Adult men don't babysit things.

What are we doing?

God, I haven't see you since
you were, like, 15.

Yeah. So Dr. Pedulla, he's still alive?
You two are still together?

- Honey, we talked about this.

Nancy has a urinary tract infection, okay?

No, Mom.

- Thirteen.

- Yeah, neither am I.

I wouldn't have to be here tonight.
I could be out having fun.

What?

Honey, it's not hot. It's just his name.

Babysitting?

say a quick hi-ho to her,

Hey!

00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:16,345
Hey, Karl, what's up?
How did you get this number?

682
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,141
I got it off your Facebook page,

683
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:20,842
as I was trying to friend you
as you were walking out.

684
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,113
Anyway, as I was friending you,
Julio noticed that

685
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:26,586
maybe you stole
a baby dinosaur egg from me.

686
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:28,816
And it's just, like, I'm confused.

687
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:31,860
You know what I mean?
Because I'm thinking that we're friends,

00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:35,556
and then all of a sudden,
I don't know, it's like...

I really liked you, you know?

Because Rodrigo here is a thief,
and now I'm in deep shit.

And the worst part of all of this
is that I'm stuck here with you three.

714
00:31:58,147 --> 00:32:00,911
You, you got more issues
than a magazine stand.

And, you, wipe the makeup off your face,
Picasso. What are you, a mob wife?

You're a douche.

Look, Noah, if you hate us that much,
then just drop us off with our parents.

Okay. Slater, can you get off the phone?

733
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:25,096
I need an idea. You can text
your buddy Clayton later, okay?

BLITHE: Yeah, man, seriously!

SLATER: It's not Clayton. It's those twins,

00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:32,363
and they want me to go to Prospect Hall
for Wendy Sapperstein's Bat Mitzvah.

That's, like, a pretty swanky joint, right?

738
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:39,481
Yeah, the Sappersteins are totally
loaded and she's, like, crazy spoiled.

Spoiled.

740
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:43,919
So lots of gifts, lots of cash.

741
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:48,013
Slater, you're a genius.
You're a genius, dude!

All right, let's go, let's go, let's go!

Let's go, let's go, let's go! Hustle!

just invite anyone you know,

748
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:10,738
anyone who's ugly,
because they seem to all be here!

749
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:14,007
MRS. SAPPERSTEIN: That's very nice.
Is that what the rabbis taught you?

750
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,846
Mom! This is my night. It's my celebration,

751
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:19,454
and I did not invite these nerds
to my Bat Mitzvah!

752
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:22,854
What more can I do for you?
Rent the Taj Ma-fucking-hal for you?

753
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:26,725
There's so much blue cheese here,
it smells like barf, Mom!

754
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:29,798
Damn, Wendy Sapperstein's a big ol' bitch!

755
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,161
Yeah, she scares me.

756
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,165
All right, guys,
we're gonna stay under the radar.

757
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:34,702
Okay? Keep it low profile.

758
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:38,939
Did you hear what I just said?
I said low profile! All right?

759
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:43,004
Stop puncturing balloons!
Do you understand me? (SHUSHING)

Noah, Noah.
Does this place have bottle service?

761
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:47,947
I want a Red Bull and vodka.

762
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:50,519
No, you don't. You don't even know
what that is. It's bad for you.

763
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,283

TWIN 2: Yeah, this Bat Mitzvah is the best!

766
00:34:58,528 --> 00:35:00,996
It's like Jew city out there,

TWIN 2: You ready to go dance?

768

He's ready to go dance.
This guy was born to dance.

769
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:06,829
- You want to come?
- Come on. Let's go.

You big stud.

771
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:12,134
Time to go make a Slater sandwich!
Some of that gingerbread, my man.

That's you, right?

779
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:49,238
- Yeah. What's up? How's it going?
- It's Roxanne.

780
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,677
I lived in the dorms down the hall
from you, freshman year.

781
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:53,476
That's right. We were in Astronomy, right?

782
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,016
Yeah, I sat behind you in Astronomy.

783
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:57,313
We were, like, the only two students
who seemed to give a shit.

784
00:35:57,453 --> 00:35:58,545
(CHUCKLES) That's right. Yeah.

785
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:01,555
You made that scale model of Saturn
with a cantaloupe, right?

786
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:03,386
- Oh, shit, yeah.
- That was you.

787
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:05,120
- That thing was fresh. That was cool.
- Yeah, that was me.

788
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:07,491
Did you know about
the geomagnetic storm tonight?

789
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,656
I did. I'm gonna check it out. Are you?
I'm actually kind of excited for it.

790
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,926
Yeah. For sure.

You gonna go on the chair?

795
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:22,611
- I don't think so.
- Yeah?

796
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:24,111
No. No chair for me.

797
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:26,807
I can't believe you're here.
Like, I haven't seen you in forever.

798
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:29,611
Yeah, I'm actually not in school this year.

799
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,845
That sucks.

800

But I'm working right now, obviously.

801
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,518
But once I get off work, I'm going to
a pool hall with some of my co-workers.

802
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,252
- Would you want to come?
- Oh, cool.

803
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:44,629
That would be great, but I'm actually
in the middle of a situation currently.

804
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,463
Oh, yeah. No worries.
I just thought I'd ask.

805
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,127
No. Thank you. Any other time.

Oh, shit.

- It was great running into you again.
- (LAUGHING) Oh, my God!

Put your fucking dick away!

You're getting piss all over me!

- What were you doing?

815
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:13,655
You do not take a piss
in the middle of a party, okay?

816
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,220
You don't piss in the middle

(SOFTLY) Oh, shit.

What are you doing here?
What about your tarantula?

- Oh, I got over that, man.
- It's just a spider, bro.

821
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:27,507
Since when do you hang out
with Benji Gillespie?

822
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,635
Look, I can hang out
with as many other people as I want.

823
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:31,144
I don't think you understand that.

824
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:33,044
I'm getting kind of sick
of going to your house all the time

825
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:34,581
and watching tennis.

826

We do other shit.

827
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:38,576
No, we don't! You don't do anything!

828
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:40,848
I can't just always hang around you.

829
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:43,720
I don't get why you're being mean to me.

830
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:45,486
He doesn't want to hang out
with you any more, bro.

831
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:46,856
How hard is it to understand that?

832
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:50,762
Just stop calling and texting him
all the time. It's weird.

833
00:37:53,302 --> 00:37:54,701
Is that true?

834
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,871
See you around.

00:37:58,407 --> 00:37:59,669
Yo.

Hey, man. You all right?

- Those guys fucking with you?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

838
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:05,474
- You okay?
- Yeah, just leave me alone!

839
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,977
Hi. I'm so sorry to have
to say this to you.

840
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:13,486
It's just that I can't
seem to find your car.

841
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:17,489
What do you mean, you can't find my car?

842
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:20,693
Well, I think we lost it.

843
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:23,389
You didn't lose your Morrissey box set.
Where's my fucking car, dude?

(SOBS)

845
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:26,496
Did you lose it
or you taking a shit right now?

846
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:27,823
A little of both.

847
00:38:27,935 --> 00:38:29,232
There's no "a little bit" of taking a shit.

848
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:30,735
You're either shitting your pants
or you're not.

849
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:35,370
Stop crying, all right?
It's not going to solve anything.

850
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:37,137
Let's go find this shit. All right?

851

Hey, look! There it is!

852
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:42,448
Oh, thank God we found it.

853
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,519
That's not finding it, you idiot.
Someone stole it.

854
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:47,351
Oh, poo.

855
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:56,861
Three thousand bucks.

Is that good?

857
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:03,259
No. It's not. We need 7,000 more.
And it's almost 11:00.

858
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:06,737
Hey, Noah, I have an idea. How about
you start your own signature fragrance?

859
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:08,035
That's a great idea!

860
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:10,872
I'll just alert my team of scientists,
have them invent a new perfume.

861
00:39:10,978 --> 00:39:14,141
We'll start selling it and we'll have
seven grand in the next 45 minutes!

I'm just trying to help.

864
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:21,180
All I know is,
is I'm going to be a famous celebrity

who designs on the side,
and I'm going to be rich.

What the hell are you talking about?

867
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:26,652
You do know that just being a celebrity and

868
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,921
having a good time is
not a real job, right?

869
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:32,226
Yeah, it is! Being a famous celebrity
is the greatest thing in the world!

870
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,800
It means people take your picture.

871

You get to have birthday parties at
the coolest clubs and dance on tables.

doesn't want to hang out with me any more

878

No, I won't.

00:49:10,376 --> 00:49:12,606
(CHUCKLING)

1074
00:49:12,745 --> 00:49:14,110
Oh, shit!

1075
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:26,046
- Why the hell did you do that, Rodrigo?
- BLITHE: Seriously, dude!

1076
00:49:26,158 --> 00:49:27,523
You said you didn't have
any more cherry bombs!

1077
00:49:27,626 --> 00:49:28,923
How many more do you have, huh?

1078
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:31,859
You can't just go around
blowing up bathrooms! It's not cool!

1079
00:49:31,964 --> 00:49:33,727
Why can't you be
more like your brother and sister?

1080
00:49:33,832 --> 00:49:35,959
They're at least half crazy.
You're full-on nuts!

1081
00:49:36,635 --> 00:49:39,160
They are not my brother and sister!
They are nothing to me!

1082
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:40,898
They are not my family!

1083
00:49:41,006 --> 00:49:43,804
She does nothing all day but paint her face
like a <i>puta.</i> She is a <i>puta!</i>

1084
00:49:43,943 --> 00:49:44,932
And this one is sick in the head!

1085
00:49:45,044 --> 00:49:46,875
He goes to the head doctor
four times a week!

1086
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:49,072
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1087
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:51,979
- Hey! Stop acting crazy, okay?
- He is the crazy one.

1088
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:54,642
He has this medicine! He <i>loco!</i>
He <i>muy loco!</i>

1089
00:49:54,787 --> 00:49:56,414
- Hey, relax!
- Shut up!

1090
00:49:56,522 --> 00:49:58,717
You shut up with your stupid fanny pack!
I take your fanny pack!

1091
00:49:58,824 --> 00:50:01,054
No! No! No, I need that!

1092
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,220
Stop it! I need that! My pills! No! No!

1093
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,127
NOAH: What did you do that for?

1094
00:50:06,265 --> 00:50:08,324
- SLATER: Pull over! Pull over!
- Okay! Okay!

1095
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:11,265
SLATER: Right now! Right now!
NOAH: Okay! Okay!

1096
00:50:13,272 --> 00:50:15,240
Slater! Where are you going?

1097
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:17,104
What the fuck is your problem, man?

1098
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:18,301
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

1099
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:24,009
NOAH: Slater.

1100
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:25,639
You're not going to find it, all right?

1101
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:29,311
- I need those pills, okay? I need them.
- No, you don't.

1102
00:50:29,455 --> 00:50:31,616
Yes, I do, okay? I have serious issues.

1103
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:33,055
You don't have serious issues.

1104
00:50:33,158 --> 00:50:36,184
Yes, I do! Those pills are
the only thing that keep me normal,

1105
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:37,592
and I need them!

1106
00:50:37,696 --> 00:50:39,254
I can't do this any more.

1107
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:41,166
Slater, you're gay, all right?

1108
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:43,996
What the fuck are you talking about?

1109
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:46,731
- Nothing. Never mind.
- Take that back!

1110
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,966
Take it back, Noah!

1111
00:50:50,242 --> 00:50:51,903
You're gay. All right?

1112
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:55,105
You're as queer as a football bat,
and that's fine.

1113
00:50:55,214 --> 00:50:57,375
And if your therapist
hasn't clued you into that by now,

1114
00:50:57,483 --> 00:50:59,383
then you should ask
for your money back, pal.

1115
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:01,612
You ever think the reason you're so upset

1116
00:51:01,754 --> 00:51:03,745
your buddy Clayton
doesn't want to hang out any more

1117
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:06,347
is because you have
a lot of special feelings for him

1118
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:07,982
that maybe he doesn't feel back?

1119
00:51:08,093 --> 00:51:09,685
It breaks your heart, man.

1120
00:51:09,795 --> 00:51:11,524
And that breaks my heart.

1121
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,393
'Cause I know what that feels like.

1122
00:51:13,499 --> 00:51:15,194
I feel it all the time.

1123
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,894
I don't want to be gay! I'm not gay!

1124
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:19,326
Tough.

1125
00:51:19,438 --> 00:51:21,303
I don't want to be a faggot!

1126
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,874
Hey! Do not say shit like that!
Do you understand me?

1127
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:26,942
This is the worst night of my life.

1128
00:51:30,082 --> 00:51:32,642
All right, high school is going to suck.

1129
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:36,585
Coming out to your parents,
it's not gonna be a picnic, either.

1130
00:51:36,688 --> 00:51:38,622
But trust me when I tell you

1131
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:41,215
that when you get to college,
nobody will care.

1132
00:51:41,326 --> 00:51:43,817
And then, when you graduate college,

1133
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:46,897
you'll get an awesome job
in the entertainment industry.

1134
00:51:46,999 --> 00:51:50,833
You'll be super-organized and
dress really well, you'll smell good.

1135
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:53,404
Smell good?
What are you talking about, Noah?

1136
00:51:53,505 --> 00:51:55,063
Relax. Listen to me.

1137
00:51:57,943 --> 00:52:00,639
My dad hates me. All right?

1138
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,948
I got kicked out of college.

1139
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,282
(SIGHING)

1140
00:52:06,518 --> 00:52:08,850
Before tonight, this babysitting thing,

1141
00:52:08,987 --> 00:52:11,251
I've only ever had one job,
and I was a lifeguard.

1142
00:52:11,356 --> 00:52:15,816
I got fired after four days because
I kept falling asleep in the sun.

1143
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:20,595
I'm a constant disappointment to my mom,
who's the only decent person in my life.

1144
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:22,633
I've been arrested numerous times.

1145
00:52:22,734 --> 00:52:25,669
I had a month-long, intense addiction
to Robitussin.

1146
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:28,997
There's only one freak out here.

1147
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,342
You're looking at him.

1148
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:35,040
I've never had a gay thought in my life,
so what does that tell you?

1149
00:52:36,315 --> 00:52:38,783
That tells me you're pretty messed up.

1150
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:41,284
I have seen <i>Devil Wears Prada</i>
about 19 times,

1151
00:52:41,386 --> 00:52:43,445
but that's because it's a good movie.

1152
00:52:43,555 --> 00:52:45,455
It's a good flick.

1153
00:52:45,557 --> 00:52:48,685
<i>Devil Wears P.</i> You ever seen it?
<i>D Wears P?</i>

1154
00:52:48,827 --> 00:52:51,227
I think, like, once.
I don't really remember it though.

1155
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:55,727
Nothing's wrong with you. You're normal.

1156
00:52:57,336 --> 00:52:59,531
Just super gay.

1157
00:53:01,907 --> 00:53:03,807
You're a dick.

1158
00:53:03,909 --> 00:53:07,310
(LAUGHS) Yes, that's true.
Enough of the pills, all right?

1159
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:09,940
Okay.

1160
00:53:11,183 --> 00:53:12,582
You know,

1161
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:17,047
deep down, I think I always kind of knew.

1162
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:22,392
(SIGHS) But don't tell anybody yet, okay?

1163
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:24,553
I won't. I won't.

1164
00:53:26,031 --> 00:53:28,022
What do you think I am, an asshole?

1165
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:30,568
(LAUGHING) Yeah, sort of.

1166
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:32,169
Come on, Ricky Martin,
let's get out of here.

1167
00:53:32,271 --> 00:53:33,829
SLATER: That's an example.

1168
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,772
Hey, Slater, are you okay?

1169
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,207
Yeah, I'm okay.

1170
00:53:39,311 --> 00:53:41,677
Hey! That's Mom's car!

1171
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,769
NOAH: Are you sure?

1172
00:53:42,981 --> 00:53:44,243
(BEEPING)

1173
00:53:44,449 --> 00:53:46,110
All right. Let's go! Let's go!

1174
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:49,015

(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1176

BLITHE: This is my kind of club.

1177
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:23,553
SLATER: Let's just go home.
NOAH: No.

1178
00:54:23,655 --> 00:54:25,646
All right? I have a half-hour
to get to this party,

1179
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:29,318
pay off Karl, pick my girlfriend up
off the floor, get you kids home,

1180
00:54:29,428 --> 00:54:32,158
and be home in time for my mom
to tell me how awesome her night was.

1181
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:36,132
I'm not gonna let some bullshit
car thief fuck this up for me.

1182
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:39,062
Hey.

1183
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:41,435
What's happening, my man?
How you doing, man?

1184
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,236
You know, this ain't no place for no kids.

1185
00:54:44,343 --> 00:54:46,140
These aren't kids, these are little people.

- What's your name, baby?
- They call me Soul, Soul Baby.

- I fly, baby.

- Fly, fly, fly away, baby.
- In the clouds, no frowns.

All right, now,
that's what I'm talking about.

- Tears, no fears, man.
- Is that right?

Respect it, don't neglect it.

talking about, baby. My brother.

00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:28,811
I'm here for my minivan. What's up?

1205
00:55:29,054 --> 00:55:31,420
(LAUGHS) Get out of here.

1206
00:55:31,523 --> 00:55:33,889
What, are you stalking me now?
You're stealing my car?

1207

I'm serious. Give me the keys.

1208

Look, homey, we got beef.
You understand that?

1209
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,124
Just give me the keys.

Step back, homey!
This ain't where you belong!

All right,
you're going to listen to me, okay?

1212

You're right,
I threw up in your grandmother's ashes.

- Hell, yeah, you did.
- It was an accident.

- Fucked up.
- I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

I have been stuck
babysitting these three kids.

1216
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:58,545
I was talked into buying cocaine
for my girlfriend,

1217
00:55:58,684 --> 00:56:00,914
who I realize is not even my girlfriend.

1218
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:04,887
She's just a girl who occasionally
lets me stick my face in her crotch

1219
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,958
- and who's mean to me all the time. Okay?
- (ALL LAUGH)

1220

And this time, making her happy
is probably gonna get me killed.

1221

You're acting all gangster,
stealing cars, hanging out with thugs.

Well, you know what?

1223
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:19,035
A few years ago we went to
the same lame-ass high school.

1224
00:56:19,137 --> 00:56:22,538
The point is,
you and I are two fucked-up kids

1225
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:23,938
meeting on the playground.

1226
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:29,070
I came here for my motherfucking keys
to my motherfucking minivan,

1227
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:30,580
and that's what's up!

1228
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:34,611
(ALL LAUGHING)

1229
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,447
Is that supposed to be
a threat, little man?

1230
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:37,714
I ain't giving you shit.

1231
00:56:37,823 --> 00:56:38,915
It's not a threat.

1232
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:41,390
I'm going to put
both my hands behind my back,

1233
00:56:41,493 --> 00:56:43,961
and you get one punch to my face
as hard as you want.

1234
00:56:44,096 --> 00:56:47,293
- I can punch you in the face?
- You deserve to punch me in the face.

1235
00:56:47,432 --> 00:56:49,161
Go on, baby. Punch him in the face.

1236
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:51,064
(WHISPERS) My face is ready to receive you.

1237
00:56:51,937 --> 00:56:53,564
- Noah, don't!
- What?

1238
00:56:53,739 --> 00:56:55,798
CROWD: Oh!

1239
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:57,097
TINA: Bitch.

1240
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:00,811
- BLITHE: Noah!
- I fucking love you right now.

1241
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:04,247
You killed my babysitter!

1242
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:05,509
Noah?

1243
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:08,613
(GROANS) That was bad.

1244
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,982
- BLITHE: Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1245

(ALL EX CLAIM IN SURPRISE)

1246

Oh, shit. I'm all right!

1247
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:16,594
- I'm okay!
- (ALL APPLAUDING)

1248
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:18,162
I'm okay!

1249
00:57:18,296 --> 00:57:19,661
She won this round, right?

1250
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:21,163
Oh, shit.

1251
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:23,767
She punched my face, but it's cool!
It's all good.

1252
00:57:25,637 --> 00:57:27,002
Looks like we're even.

1253
00:57:31,877 --> 00:57:34,846
Guess you ain't the little pussy
you used to be. Huh, Noah?

1254
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,448
Nope, I'm a whole different pussy now.

1255
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:39,517
All right, boy. Respect.

1256
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:43,543
Unlock it. What's inside?

1257
00:57:43,688 --> 00:57:45,315
Oh, shit, it's a bomb.

1258
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:49,023
Hell, yeah. I feel that.

1259
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,686
NOAH: Let that debris
fall across your face, girl.

1260
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:53,663
Look here, little homey.

1261
00:57:54,232 --> 00:57:55,790
I like your style, you dig?

1262
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:56,959
I appreciate that. Thank you.

1263
00:57:57,068 --> 00:57:58,865
You stand up for yours,
and I can respect that.

1264
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:03,805
If we ever need a crazy-ass white boy
to roll with us one day

1265
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:08,369
and get punched in the face
by motherfuckers, I'm-a call you.

1266
00:58:08,513 --> 00:58:11,414
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, man.

1267
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,815
Yo, listen. Listen.
Let me holler at you for a second.

1268
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,251
I just wanna let you know,

1269
00:58:16,388 --> 00:58:18,822
I just want to throw a monster shout-out
back at you, my man.

1270
00:58:18,924 --> 00:58:20,687
Monster shout-out back at me, right?

1271
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,659
I don't understand what the fuck
that is, but it sound good, though.

1272
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:25,252
- It's all good, baby.
- All right, brother.

1273
00:58:25,397 --> 00:58:27,228
Peace to you. I fucking love you, dawg.

1274
00:58:29,568 --> 00:58:31,195
Noah, are you all right?

1275
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,997
(HOARSELY) I feel so cool right now.

1276
00:58:35,006 --> 00:58:35,995
(LAUGHING)

1277
00:58:36,107 --> 00:58:37,165
This place is cool.

1278
00:58:37,275 --> 00:58:40,574
I honestly might start DJ-ing here.
I don't know.

1279
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:41,770
Okay, that's all right,

1280
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:44,746
but do you really think that
this is an appropriate place to bring kids?

1281
00:58:44,883 --> 00:58:48,250
I don't know. Look, Rodrigo's over there
chatting up some prostitutes.

1282
00:58:48,386 --> 00:58:52,015
You got Slater schooling Bell Biv DeVoe
over there in pool.

1283
00:58:52,123 --> 00:58:55,286
And Blithe's doing the Riverdance
over in the bowling alley.

1284
00:58:55,393 --> 00:58:57,793
Honestly, this is the first time
I've seen them having any kind of fun,

1285
00:58:57,896 --> 00:59:00,091
so what the hell?

1286
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:06,227
You know what that is?

1287
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:07,965
What is that?

1288
00:59:08,073 --> 00:59:09,904
Just me being cool. Playing it cool.

1289
00:59:10,976 --> 00:59:12,807
No big deal.

1290
00:59:12,944 --> 00:59:13,968
You're crazy.

1291
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,172
You're crazy slash beautiful. Whatever.

1292
00:59:21,653 --> 00:59:23,814
So, did you drive here?

1293
00:59:23,955 --> 00:59:25,286
No, I took a cab.

1294
00:59:25,423 --> 00:59:26,890
Maybe you should take my dad's car,

1295
00:59:26,992 --> 00:59:29,153
because I can't drive
both of them anyways.

1296
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:30,785
Are you serious?

1297
00:59:30,896 --> 00:59:32,864
Yeah, it'd actually really help me out.

1298
00:59:32,964 --> 00:59:34,625
Okay. How are you gonna find me?

1299
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:36,291
Do you have a phone?

1300
00:59:39,002 --> 00:59:40,492
Okay. See you.

1301
00:59:40,604 --> 00:59:43,072
- Yeah. (LAUGHS)
- Just kidding.

1302

Here, this is my phone number,
and then you can call me.

00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,505
Okay.

1304
00:59:49,446 --> 00:59:51,141
I'll call you.

Hey,

1306
00:59:53,484 --> 00:59:56,942
why did you say something to me
when you saw me earlier? I feel like

1307
00:59:57,054 --> 00:59:59,420
you kind of ignored me all freshman year.

1308
01:00:01,024 --> 01:00:05,324
I don't know.
I thought you were really funny and smart

1309
01:00:05,462 --> 01:00:07,020
and seemed really sweet.

1310
01:00:08,132 --> 01:00:10,999
I guess I was kind of nervous
to talk to you back then.

1311
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:14,769
You were nervous to talk to me?

1312
01:00:15,305 --> 01:00:16,829
Yeah.

to leave that party right now.</i>

stay away from them.

- No.
- You ran a red light

Whoa. Are they leaving?

1377
01:02:38,115 --> 01:02:40,242
Hey! What are you doing? Stop!

1378
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:42,512
Please! I need those diamonds! Come back!

1379
01:02:42,653 --> 01:02:44,518
Damn it! (GROANS)

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

1381
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:06,941
All right, I'm going to
go find my girlfriend.

1382
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:08,773
Marisa!

1383
01:03:10,547 --> 01:03:11,844
Marisa!

1384
01:03:14,585 --> 01:03:16,348
Stephanie, have you seen Marisa?

1385
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:19,354
I don't know, it's my birthday!

1386
01:03:19,456 --> 01:03:20,548
Why are you upside down?

1387
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:23,218
- Why aren't you upside down?
- Okay.

1388
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:24,351
Take care of yourself.

1389
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:26,429
You're not invited any more.

1390
01:03:28,465 --> 01:03:29,864
G-Bert, sorry to interrupt, man.

1391
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:31,832
What's up, Noah?

1392
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:33,335
Have you seen Marisa?

1393
01:03:33,437 --> 01:03:34,734
- Who's Marisa?
- She's my girlfriend.

1394
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:36,237
She's like my height, blonde hair.

1395
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:39,033
- No, sorry.
- No.

1396
01:03:39,143 --> 01:03:41,407
If I find her, we should all hang out
next week or something.

1397
01:03:41,512 --> 01:03:42,536
Totally, yeah.

1398
01:03:42,646 --> 01:03:43,738
Yeah, great.
You have great breasts. Thanks.

1399
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:45,041
- Thank you.
- Later, Noah.

1400
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:50,380
- What are you doing?
- Fuck you.

1401
01:03:51,889 --> 01:03:53,948
Why are you such an asshole, Rodrigo?

1402
01:03:55,592 --> 01:03:59,323
Ever since you moved in with us,
you've been so mean to everybody!

1403
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,694
- What's wrong with you?
- You want to know what's wrong with me?

1404
01:04:03,499 --> 01:04:04,761
This is my third family in three years.

1405
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,835
When your papas get tired with me,
they give me to another families.

1406
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:09,198
That happens every time.

1407
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:12,273
Well, maybe if you didn't do
such messed-up stuff

1408
01:04:12,407 --> 01:04:15,604
then they would actually feel
like you wanted to be here.

1409
01:04:15,744 --> 01:04:19,043
You don't know me. You look at me
like a crazy that live in your house.

1410
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,615
That's not true. You never talk to us.

1411
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,913
Honestly, you're pretty scary, man.

1412
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:29,385
I no scary. I just like having fun.

1413
01:04:29,558 --> 01:04:31,321
Boom, boom, boom. Kaboom.

1414
01:04:31,426 --> 01:04:33,724
Hey, guys, I can't find Marisa anywhere.
Let's go.

1415
01:04:34,029 --> 01:04:35,496
Come on. Where's Blithe?

1416
01:04:38,267 --> 01:04:40,064
Blithe, get down from there. We have to go.

1417
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:42,227
These are my friends!
Come on, we're having fun.

1418
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,531
No. They're not your friends.

1419
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:45,504
They're drunk and
they're making fun of you, okay?

1420
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:47,507
- You need to get down here right now.
- What are you doing?

1421
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:50,237
- Listen, they're drunk. Let's go.
- Come up here!

1422
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:52,575
- They just want to dance with me!
- They don't want to dance...

1423
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:54,444
Oh! You're here!

1424
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,519
Where have you been?
This has been the best night ever.

1425
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,283
- Are those kids?
- Yeah. They're with me.

1426
01:05:00,422 --> 01:05:01,719
I'll explain.
We need to get out of here right now.

1427
01:05:01,823 --> 01:05:03,586
Did you get the party favors?

1428
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:07,321
I had them and now I don't. I'll explain.
We need to get out of here right now.

1429
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:09,363
- I'm serious.
- MARISA: It's Ricky.

1430
01:05:09,464 --> 01:05:10,488
We don't have time for this.

1431
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:12,396
That is Ricky Fontaine.
He is my ex-boyfriend.

1432
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:14,093
I obviously have to go say hi.

1433
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,500
- Ricky!
- NOAH: You're drunk, Marisa.

1434
01:05:16,939 --> 01:05:19,430
- Hey.
- Marisa.

1435
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:20,803
What's up? How are you?

1436
01:05:20,909 --> 01:05:24,037
You haven't responded to any of my texts
in, like, a really long time.

1437
01:05:24,146 --> 01:05:26,114
Yeah. There's a reason for that.

1438
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:30,116
Marisa, I'm sorry.
I don't know how else I can say it.

1439
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,948
We had a great run, but it's over now,

1440
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:35,353
and I wish you the best
and I pray for you, I do.

1441
01:05:35,857 --> 01:05:37,222
Is everything okay?

1442
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:41,025
Actually, no. Ricky's being kind of a dick.

1443
01:05:41,163 --> 01:05:43,290
- Why don't you defend me, Noah?
- BOTH: What?

1444
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,332
Yeah. You're being a real dick!

1445
01:05:45,434 --> 01:05:47,026
Defend me! You're being mean!

1446
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:49,330
What are you talking about?
I've been nothing but cool to you, man.

1447
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:50,905
Okay. She's drunk.

1448
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,633
There's a misunderstanding happening.
Why don't we all just relax?

1449
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:54,902
(MOUTHING)

1450
01:05:55,043 --> 01:05:56,874
No offense, bro, but who are you?

1451
01:05:57,012 --> 01:05:59,674
- I'm Noah. We're dating.
- MARISA: He's my friend.

1452
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:01,544
We're in a relationship, okay?

1453
01:06:01,683 --> 01:06:03,674
Friendship relationship.

1454
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:04,843
Well, good luck with that, bro,

1455
01:06:04,953 --> 01:06:07,080
'cause dealing with her
is a pretty big nightmare.

1456
01:06:07,189 --> 01:06:08,656
I don't envy you.

1457
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:11,692
That is a terrible thing
to say to somebody!

1458
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:13,350
What?

1459
01:06:13,462 --> 01:06:16,898
Look, you hurt her feelings. Okay?
Just be nice.

1460
01:06:17,032 --> 01:06:18,897
What are you going to do about it, bro?

1461
01:06:19,735 --> 01:06:21,100
What?

1462
01:06:24,139 --> 01:06:25,163
What the hell was that?

1463
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:28,731
A throat jab? I don't know.
I don't street-fight very often.

Are you okay, Noah?

1468
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:40,586
Yeah.

1469
01:06:40,722 --> 01:06:43,520
Get out of here. I got it. I got this guy.

1470
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,354

Did I get him good?

1477
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,237
Get off!

- Listen, we gotta go right now.

I would be very careful how you talk to me.

You'd better be very careful
