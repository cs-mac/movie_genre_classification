1
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,429
I always knew I'd be famous.

2
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,108
Back at school,
if you'd have told me that four of us...

3
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,913
would become the biggest rock band
on the planet,

4
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:23,747
I'd have asked
who the other three were.

5
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:33,663
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

6
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:37,066
Everyone wants to be a rock star, right?

7
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:40,272
Well, this wasn't some vague dream,
this was real.

8
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,111
<i>I had it all planned out.</i>

9
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,833
Form a band.

10
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:53,190
Release a series
of ground-breaking albums.

11
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:55,746
Tour the world's greatest stadiums.

12
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:59,705
Pull off the biggest rock and roll
invasion of America since the Beatles.

13

<i>He rises, I fall.</i>

18
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:24,393
He just gets bigger and better.

19
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:27,789
I suck up all the shite luck
that never goes his way.

20

You'll have someone's eye out with that.

- What, that fogey old fart?

30
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,312
What's he gonna teach you,
a punk rock version of "Danny Boy"?

31
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:31,470
Yeah, maybe.

32

Hey, Paul.
Paul, what's the craic?

33
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,881
Larry's putting a band together.

34

Oh, great.

35
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:40,555
- Who is Larry?
- Larry Mullen, two years below.

36
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,599
- Oh, nice axe, man.
- Oh, cheers.

37
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:44,196
Yeah, he saved all his pocket money
for three years,

38
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:45,511
- he's so rock and roll, aren't ya?
- Oh, yeah.

39
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:46,957
You should come and try out.

40
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:49,353
- Hey, they need a singer.
- You're looking at him.

41
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:53,037
You? It's bad enough having to
stand next to you in choir practice

42
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:54,602
singing like you've lost a bollock.

43
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:58,313
Besides, you... you really don't much
look like a front man, you know?

44
00:03:58,484 --> 00:03:59,996
Oh, yeah?
What's a front man look like?

45
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:01,357
Yeah?

46
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:03,400
- Like me!
- Oh.

47
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:07,159
Sorry, Neil. Nice try.
But it's my gig.

48
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:08,677
There's plenty more bands out there.

49
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,521

- Oh, sorry, yeah.

53
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:31,480
Oh, Jesus, lads. Make some space.
Mick Jagger didn't have to deal

54
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:33,920
with a bass in his face
and a drum kit up his arse.

55
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,837
Made it myself.
I got the design from a mag.

56
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,439
What, was it a bird spotting mag,
was it?

57
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:39,676
It looks like a duck
with a stick up its arse.

58
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,359
Do you really need a guitar as well?
You know you can't play it.

59
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,924
You can talk.

60
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:46,155
Jesus Christ, can nobody
play their instruments here?

61
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,805
Will you relax, Larry?
We've got Dave.

62
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:51,117
Give us a shot at yours, then.
I'll show you what it can do.

63
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:53,116
- Yeah, OK. Here.
- Just for...

OK. One, two.
One, two. One, two.

65
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:58,520
OK, come on, guys. Come on.
Can we just play something together?

66
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:01,154
- You know, at the same time, all right?
- OK, right. Whoa, whoa.

Do we know anything?
David Bowie, yeah?

70
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:08,795
- [Larry] Yeah.
- [boy 1] Anyone heard the Ramones?

71
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,366
- Yeah, was that...
- The Clash?

72
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,246
Or how about Thin Lizzy?
Thin Lizzy?

73
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:16,126
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sex Pistols and Dire Straits.

74
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:18,566
OK, just forget I said that.

Well, you can't have him.
On rhythm guitar or anywhere.

He's with me. Ivan's the lead guitar
and I head up the band.

So, have yous got a name yet?
What about the McCormick Brothers?

123
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:36,054
That's not very punk, is it, Dad?
We'd sound like a folk band.

124
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:38,207
We'd have to grow beards
and live in a commune.

125
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,172
We're called The Undertakers,
Mr. McCormick.

Ivan, is Ivan Axe.

And Kev over there is Kevin Carcass.

I wanted to be called Jonny Durex,
but I was afraid it'd upset me ma.

131
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:54,649
She's gotta know what a Durex is, son,
or you wouldn't be here.

132
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,772
- What's a Durex?

Six years later.

134
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,167
[Mr. McCormick] You'll be needing
punk hair-dos.

135
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:03,135
I'll do them for you. No point
in wasting money at the barbers.

136
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:06,448
Yeah, but we can do without
all that swearing... and the vomit.

137
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:09,898
We've our first gig next week. It's with
Paul's lot, they're called The Hype.

138
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:12,173
Oh, yeah, the band I almost joined.

139
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:14,248
Next week,
we'll blow them off the stage.

140
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:15,930
And then you'll be glad
you stuck with your big brother.

141
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:18,658

Oh, Paul was just talking to me
about second guitar.

147

Was he?

148
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:38,456
And what was he saying?

149
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,048
We decided we don't need one, so...

150
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,130
- No hard feelings, hey, Ivan?
- No, you're grand.

151
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,530
Course not.
He plays lead for The Undertakers now.

152
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:48,736
Never mind second guitar.

153

Yeah, well, I thought it preferable
to "a sea of shit".

Are you giving it the cover?

314
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:44,315
No, I think Ireland's hottest band
just pushed it out.

315
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:45,998
What? Gary's U2 piece?

316
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:48,520
It's only Gary's U2 piece
'cause you turned it down.

317
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:49,835
You picky bastard.

Thanks, I am standing right here,
you know?

319
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,245
Yeah, and I didn't want
to give it to a rookie.

320
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:56,204
- Yeah.
- Well, it's weird, but I...

321
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:58,766
It's weird,
but I didn't really much fancy

322
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:01,804
talking to my old school mates about
how brilliantly amazing they are

323
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:03,718
and how much hot sex they're getting,
you know?

324
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:05,400
Yeah, there's a little bit more to it
than that.

325
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,400
Yeah, I bet. "U2 are brill.
And hasn't Bono got lovely hair.

And he's dead good at singing
and that".

327
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,720
You're just jealous 'cause no one
writes about your poxy band.

328
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,639
Oh, really?

329
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:22,005
Ah, Jesus.
Neil, not more fucking demo tapes.

334
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:37,486
If you cover the Horse Slips gig for me.
Quid pro quo.

335
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:40,367
No way. Their singer still wants to
murder me after that last piece I wrote.

336
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:43,841
Where's the venue?

337
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:46,284
- McGarrety's.
- Fuck off!

338
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:48,360
- Fuck off!
- I hope you said yes.

339
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,441
Of course I said yes, it's McGarrety's.
Legends are born in the place.

00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,327
- When is this?
- Next Saturday.

341
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,129
Hold on. That's the day
the Pope is in town.

342
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,042
- I'm sorry?
- The Pope?

343
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,848
Wears a big popey hat.
Drives a popemobile. He's the Pope.

344
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,489
Who's gonna go and see the Pope?
It's only the Pope.

345
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,039
- It's not like it's anyone good.
- [Eric] I'm going.

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,042
I'm an altar boy.

347
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,529
[all] Fuck off!

348
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,046
Eric, who do you wanna be
in ten years time, eh?

349
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,361
Keith Moon? Rocking out
with the biggest band in the world?

350
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,921
Neck deep in girls and booze
and drugs, yeah?

351
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,161
Or a piss-poor,
30 year old altar boy,

352
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,686
who sits in at the weekend
and pulls his winky?

353
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,081
Didn't Keith Moon die?

354
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:28,322
Listen, Eric...

355
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:32,724
I am asking you to make a choice.

356
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,531
It's me or God.

357

<i>[crowd roaring]</i>

358

I can't believe the Pope
fucked our band.

359
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:58,250
I never liked him. He has no
appreciation of the live music scene.

What are you doing here, Plugger?

364
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,253
Me boss, Danny Machin,
runs security here.

365
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,449
I keep the eejits in line.

366
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:13,047
Well, when they show up I do.

367
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:15,569
What? Danny Machin the criminal?

368
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:17,292
He prefers enpreteneur.

369
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,805
He doesn't mind if I deal a bit of gear
on the side, you know?

370
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:23,886
So, if you want anything.
Coke, acid, weed, I'm your man.

371
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,966
No, you're all right, Plugger, but...

372
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:27,727
It's good to see you've
done well for yourself.

What about Bono and the lads, yeah?

375
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,093
- Away to the big time.
- Yeah.

376
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:38,691
We should have stuck with them,
we'd be getting a ride every night.

377
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,124
Hey.

378
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:43,206
Hasn't your man, Machin,
got a venue or two of his own?

379
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,843
No, Neil.
He'll cut off our balls.

380
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:47,893
Could you put in
a word for us, Plugger?

381
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,887
You know, maybe get us a gig
for old time's sake?

382
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,045
Sure.

383
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,935
Leave it with me, lads.
I know just the place.

Still, you had the girls going.

I'm surprised you could hear anything
at all. The sound is shite in here.

416
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:56,735
You really want to get yourself a better
system if you want decent bands to play.

417

Yeah, well, when I find a decent band,

You don't take your baths in here,

No. That's for people who annoy me.

You know, not many people talk to me

00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:52,381
There's always been that connection,

429
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:53,661
Oh, you're a gangster, are you?

430
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:56,215
'Cause you're sure not
a fucking celebrity.

431
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:00,705
It's only a matter of time.

432

I don't suppose you know anyone

433
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:06,541
looking to invest in
an incredible new band?

434

Why, do you know
an incredible new band?

435
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:12,379
Come on, you saw us play.
We just had the wrong crowd tonight.

436
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:14,697
But with the right crowd
and the right backer we can...

437
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:17,984
You know, when my girls
go on their break,

438
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:22,379
they usually duck out the back
for a fag and a go at the crossword.

439
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:25,061
Tonight, they were clocking you.

440
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:28,504
- Tea, Plug.
- Well, there you go.

441
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,147
There's money to be made in music.

442
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,345
Money that doesn't involve
someone getting buried.

443
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,105
[stammers] I mean, look at U2.

444
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:39,829
I bet you wish you'd got in there before
the lawyers had them all sewn up,

445
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:42,138
and we're gonna be bigger than them.

446
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:48,141
Yeah, you're better looking than Bono.
I'll give you that.

447
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:49,788
Thanks.

448
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:54,227
But the... the question is,
do you want in?

449
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:57,426
- Five grand.
- Ten would be more realistic.

450
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:00,262
I could do ten.

451
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,024
My ten buys me twenty-five per cent.

452
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:06,020
You don't get twenty-five per cent
of me that easy.

453
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,306
Is this my negotiating face?

454
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,983
OK, ten.
And a ticket to London.

455
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:15,302
I'll give you two tickets. One for you
and one for the skinny fucker.

456
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,463
And remember.
If you fuck with me...

457
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,342
...I will kill you.

458
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,229
[nervous chuckle]

459
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,787
OK, everyone your attention, please.

No. It makes you realise

Give me one good reason why not?

486
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:42,704
Because we're broke.

What about Bono's offer of a deal?

Are you just gonna
walk away from that?

494
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,228
If Bono thinks we're great,
we don't need him.

495
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:03,432
Oh, that makes loads of sense, Neil.

496
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:06,394
We go straight to the source.
To the majors. Atlantic. Columbia.

The McCormick brothers together.

And then, you will always be

On one level, yes.

But on another,
it's about existential angst.

explain the costumes.

- No, we always dress like this.

- Are you the new runners?
- No.

Then he sort of broke down.
It was all very uncool.

681
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,382
Yeah, but he did tell you
about our deal?

682
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,585
Yeah, and the fifty grand advance.

Oh yeah, it's ringing bells.

No. Not really.

In fact, I'll tell you why you boys
will never be signed to this label.

Therefore, I hate you.

to resort to ear plugs. Or murder.

769
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:01,877
Listen, I'm really sorry, Gloria.
We'll try and turn it down.

770
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,877
You really don't have to leave.

771
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:05,923
Yes, I do. I have a job interview.

772
00:41:06,727 --> 00:41:09,321
Go on, practice on me. What's
the first thing you want out of a job?

773
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:11,842
- You're not interviewing me, Neil.
- Oh, come on.

774
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:14,396
Oh, OK, I don't know...

775
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:17,081
The usual stuff:
pleasure, satisfaction.

776
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:19,239
What about a job that combines
pleasure, satisfaction

777
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:21,716
- and appeals to your love of music?
- Where are you going with this?

778
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:23,684
I thought if you can't put up
with us, you could join us.

779
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:26,203
[laughs] I am not joining your band.

780
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:28,958
No, but you could be our manager.

781
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,479
Are you fucking with me?
Because I'm already running late.

782
00:41:32,648 --> 00:41:34,479
No, I just thought that you know,
you know the scene,

783
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:36,320
and what with all your shite luck
at the theatre and everything,

784
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:38,206
you know, maybe we could combine
our shite luck,

785
00:41:38,368 --> 00:41:41,165
and together we can make something
a little bit less shite.

786
00:41:41,328 --> 00:41:42,727
That's tempting.

787
00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:44,924
No, seriously,
you need the work, we need help.

788
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,568
We're made for each other.
We'll give you ten per cent.

789
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:48,003
Ten per cent of nothing is nothing.

790
00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:49,965
Brilliant! See, you can do the maths
and everything.

791
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:53,360
Plus, you run a theatre,
so you know how to handle people.

792
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:56,086
Music people are very different.

793
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:57,763
Just start with the idea
they're all arses

794
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,124
and every so often you will be
pleasantly surprised.

795
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,928
Go on.

796
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,649
So, does the band have a name?

797
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,128
At the moment
we're stuck somewhere

798

and Lady Garden.

799

Wow. You really do need help,
don't you?

800
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,404
Let me think about it, all right?

801
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,526
Couldn't ask for more.

802
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,446
Well, you are the hottest label in town.

803
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:30,044
Surely you've heard of Shook Up?

804
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:32,167
You should hear the new stuff
they're coming up with.

805
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:33,684

Then how do you explain that?

What?

825

A million copies of the album sold.

A million.

827
00:43:51,615 --> 00:43:54,687
That's like the population of
a small country jumping up and down

What's your problem?

833
00:44:11,256 --> 00:44:14,090
I stopped Ivan being in the band.

834
00:44:14,257 --> 00:44:16,248
- What band?
- That band.

835
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:18,249
U2?

836
00:44:19,896 --> 00:44:20,886
Yeah.

837
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:23,048
Jesus, Neil, how?

838
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:25,891
Well, we grew up with them back home.

839
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:28,049
They wanted Ivan.

840
00:44:29,098 --> 00:44:31,133
I sorta hung on to him.

841
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:35,089
And then I lied to him.

842
00:44:37,418 --> 00:44:39,489
And he still doesn't know.

843
00:44:41,858 --> 00:44:43,211
Wow.

844
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,850
You total asshole.

845
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,011
It was before they were famous.

846
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:50,931
I thought we were gonna be
bigger than them.

847
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:53,613
That's why it's not enough for us
to just be OK.

848
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:57,328
We have to be... we have to be big.
We have to be really, really big.

849
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,057
So that I can look him in the eye
and I can say

850
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:01,414
"Are you glad you stuck with me?"

851
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,850
You must love him a lot.

852
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,850
Yeah.

853
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,858
But it's also the guilt.

854
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:18,540
You know how good
the Irish are at that.

855
00:45:33,621 --> 00:45:36,533
So why'd you give up your band?

856
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:38,692
My ex took it.

857
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:41,373
It was kind of like a divorce.

858
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:45,137
He got the band
and I got my life back.

859
00:45:45,302 --> 00:45:46,701
Mine was the better deal.

860
00:45:46,862 --> 00:45:48,581
You were in a band with your ex?

861
00:45:48,743 --> 00:45:51,097
What was it like, Sonny and Cher?

862
00:45:51,262 --> 00:45:54,459
Ah, more like Sid and Nancy.

863
00:45:54,622 --> 00:45:59,014
And then when he split back
to New York I swore that

864
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:02,334
I would never get involved
with anyone on the scene again.

865

Yeah.

925
00:49:05,953 --> 00:49:07,989
You know, "Beautiful folk in,
ugly lepers out".

926
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,985
- Neil McCormick.
- The McCormick brothers. Remember?

927
00:49:11,152 --> 00:49:13,144
Oh, yeah. The folk act
with the rape song.

928
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:15,953
- [both] Yeah, yeah!
- Oh, I quite liked that, didn't I?

929
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:17,627
Yeah, you said you loved it.

930
00:49:17,794 --> 00:49:20,353
All right, look,
meet me downstairs in a minute.

931
00:49:20,514 --> 00:49:21,787
OK. Neil.

932
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:23,433
Fuck off.

933
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:26,870
What the hell happened? You offered us
a deal and then you buggered off.

934
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,945
Yeah, I don't know.
I had some kind of misunderstanding

935
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:31,833
with those arseholes there,
but I've formed my own label now, so...

936
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:35,590
Sort of a free floating,
free-loving, free agent. Yeah?

937
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:38,269
Are you still doing
that folk rape shit?

938
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:42,428
No, no. These days we're sounding more
like U2 but with a bigger hit potential.

939
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:45,872
- Did I ever see you play?
- No.

940
00:49:46,036 --> 00:49:48,596
I mean call me old fashioned,
but I don't like to sign anybody

941
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:50,108
until I've seen them live.

942
00:49:50,274 --> 00:49:53,074
You know, it's so I can really
experience that wow factor.

943
00:49:53,236 --> 00:49:56,626
Second Saturday in July.
It's gonna be amazing.

944
00:49:56,796 --> 00:49:58,991
Probably one of the best gigs
you've ever seen in your entire life.

945
00:49:59,156 --> 00:50:00,145
- So, that's...
- What?

946
00:50:00,316 --> 00:50:02,227
Wow, OK.

947
00:50:02,396 --> 00:50:05,069
That's amazing. Here's my card.

948
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:06,795
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah.

949
00:50:06,957 --> 00:50:09,709
- I'm so pleased.
- OK, hugs. Good.

950
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:13,756
Great, great, great, great.
Fucking great.

951
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:15,474
Did I just have an acid flashback?

952
00:50:15,636 --> 00:50:18,869
No. No, that actually happened.
Look. Look.

953
00:50:19,037 --> 00:50:21,631
Hang on though. Hang on.
We don't have a pot to piss in

954
00:50:21,797 --> 00:50:23,515
and you just promised
Mr. Definitely Maybe

955
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:25,430
the most stupendous gig in history.

956
00:50:25,598 --> 00:50:27,828
Don't you worry your curly
little melon about it.

957
00:50:27,998 --> 00:50:29,272
You worry about the music.

958
00:50:29,438 --> 00:50:32,669
And I will take care of... that.

959

hear anything about them in London.

965
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,152
It's like another country over there.

966
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:01,753
I hope you've come with good news
for Mr. Machin.

967
00:51:01,919 --> 00:51:04,753
I vouched for you so it's my balls
on the block too, you know?

968
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,229
Stop your messing.

969
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,238
Jesus! Is that a gun?
Why've you got a gun?

970
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,517
I wouldn't be much good at me job
without one, would I?

- How are you?

2
00:51:30,617 --> 00:51:34,133
He's the next big U2.
Neil McCormick.

3
00:51:34,298 --> 00:51:36,731
- He's a rock star, and all.
- [girls laugh]

4

[Machin moaning]

5
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:44,806
Your mate Bono's off
conquering the world

6
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,286
and you can't even conquer
your own fucking haircut.

7
00:51:47,457 --> 00:51:49,449
Just tease it out a bit, love.

8
00:51:49,618 --> 00:51:52,085
So, what have you got to show
for me money?

9
00:51:52,257 --> 00:51:53,736
Well, we've got
this label guy, Hammond,

10
00:51:53,897 --> 00:51:55,012
and he really, really
wants to sign us,

11
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:56,691
but he says he needs to see us
play live first,

12
00:51:56,858 --> 00:51:58,496
so we need a bit more cash
so we can play that gig,

13
00:51:58,658 --> 00:51:59,932
and then he'll come through
with a deal and that.

14
00:52:00,098 --> 00:52:02,214
What happened to my ten thousand?

15
00:52:02,378 --> 00:52:05,371
Well, there...
there's been a lot of admin.

16

[laughs] Ten grand
on bloody envelopes?

17
00:52:09,018 --> 00:52:10,974
Don't come the monkey with me, son.

18
00:52:11,138 --> 00:52:14,893
You're standing there cap in hand and
you're already into me up to your tits.

21

You've got to spend money
to make money.

22
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,252
And didn't you just rob some place?

23
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:25,253
[sighs]

24
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:28,809
Sorry, Mr. Machin. I...
I can't help what the papers say.

25
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,254
Scurrilous bastards.

26
00:52:31,419 --> 00:52:35,458
They'd pin every crime and calamity
from here to Cork on me if they could.

27
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,690
I just hope my poor old mam's
not reading this shite.

28
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:44,057
I'm a household name.
Like Marigold.

29
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,131
Like Hoover.

30
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:51,054
While you've been falling on your arse
trying to get famous,

31
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:53,780
I got more famous
than the pair of yous.

32
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,171
So I've an image problem,
a cash flow problem, and you.

33
00:52:58,339 --> 00:52:59,932
What if I called in the debt?

34
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,888
- [stammers] Well, I can't pay, so...
- So what?

35
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,494
So I suppose you would
have to kill me.

36
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:10,940
[all laughing]

37
00:53:11,101 --> 00:53:15,013
For Christ's sake, Neil, I'm not
an Italian. I'm not going to kill ya.

38
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,216
[exhales]

39
00:53:16,381 --> 00:53:17,780
Yet.

40
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,892
I need to see your return
and you're no use to me dead.

41
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,973
I'll pay for your gig.

42
00:53:26,261 --> 00:53:27,773
But on one condition.

43
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,771
I am not playing any Van Morrison.

44
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,659
I'm coming over to see yous.

45
00:53:31,821 --> 00:53:33,652
I could do with a change
of surroundings.

46
00:53:33,821 --> 00:53:36,460
And I expect V-I-fucking P.

47
00:53:39,822 --> 00:53:41,380
Oh shit, that's grand.

48
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:44,897
- Hey, guys. Check this out.
- Wicked.

49
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:47,212
- That is handsome.
- You look like a girl.

50
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:50,135
I have got us a gig
at the best venue in town.

51
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:55,531
Neil.

52
00:53:58,142 --> 00:54:00,097
Come on, mate.
Who's paying for all this?

53
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:03,172
Now, I know you went to Dublin,
you sneaky git.

54
00:54:03,342 --> 00:54:04,331
I saw the tickets.

55
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:06,936
Just please tell me Dad
didn't bail us out.

56
00:54:10,502 --> 00:54:12,698
It was Bono.

57
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:14,212
Really?

58
00:54:14,383 --> 00:54:17,215

59
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:18,941
Hey, aren't they incredible?

60
00:54:19,103 --> 00:54:20,092
Yeah.

We're gonna give Hammond something
that is undeniable, man.

62

Hang on a sec, is that Bob Geldof?

- It always bloody is.

You're a genius at making
shite decisions.

You booked a gig on the same day the
Pope was doing his greatest hits tour.

85

You booked another gig on the same
day as the biggest gig in history.

86
00:55:28,944 --> 00:55:31,698
You turned down Bono's help
for us to get a record deal.

87
00:55:31,865 --> 00:55:35,459
And you turned down the chance
to sell our songs to Rod Stewart.

88
00:55:36,784 --> 00:55:39,253
OK, boys. Let's just calm down.

What did you think?

132
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,746
I think I like your style.

- Cosmic.

Big fan of The Police,
aren't you, love?

140

Nice boys.

another fucking drink, darling?

Oh, sorry. Who are you?

145
00:59:07,272 --> 00:59:08,750
Their priest.

146
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:10,583
How'd you do, Mr. Hammond, is it?

147
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:13,027
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.

148
00:59:13,192 --> 00:59:15,660
So... what are you doing...

149
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:18,186
What the fuck is he doing here?

150
00:59:18,351 --> 00:59:20,342
Well, it's just friendly support
from back home, isn't it?

151
00:59:20,512 --> 00:59:22,230
- From Danny fucking Machin?
- Martin.

152
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:26,590
Father Martin, from the local parish.
Come to bless the gig.

153
00:59:26,752 --> 00:59:29,267
Oh. Isn't that charming?

154
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:31,264
Well, it's nice to have God
in our corner.

155
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:35,948
Use all the support we can get
in this fucking, shitty business.

156
00:59:36,112 --> 00:59:39,822
So, did you bring a contract?
'Cause...

157
00:59:40,712 --> 00:59:42,668
...I brought a pen.
- Now, then.

158
00:59:42,832 --> 00:59:47,953
Danielle, are we going to sign
this young band to our new label?

159
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:50,580
I thought they were really great.

160
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:53,313
They're a big hit with the girls.

161
00:59:54,273 --> 00:59:55,342
Apparently.

162
00:59:55,513 --> 00:59:57,981
You don't want to be the poor chap
who reads about these boys

166
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:07,469
Surely you've seen enough
to make up your mind?

167
01:00:07,633 --> 01:00:10,831
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
But I don't invest lightly.

168
01:00:10,994 --> 01:00:13,461
I mean, are these boys going to
set the world on fire? I don't know.

169
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:16,706
Can you explain
Frankie Goes to Hollywood?

170
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:18,546
I can't.

171
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:20,431
I don't even like music.

172
01:00:20,593 --> 01:00:21,708
What?

173
01:00:21,873 --> 01:00:24,752
Mr. Hammond, could I have
a word with you in private?

174
01:00:24,914 --> 01:00:29,192
Would you mind?
If it's not too much of an imposition.

175
01:00:29,354 --> 01:00:31,868
There are only two reasons
I can think of

176
01:00:32,035 --> 01:00:34,469
for two gentlemen to share
a toilet cubicle.

177
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:36,511
Well, it's not the first one.

178
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,710
[laughs] Good.
Thank God for that.

179
01:00:38,874 --> 01:00:40,388
That's what I love about
the Catholic church.

180
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:42,511
You really know how
to enjoy yourselves.

181
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:44,266
Shall we use your gear, or mine?

182
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:46,106
Neither. I've sinned enough.

183
01:00:46,274 --> 01:00:49,665
I want to see my boys succeed.

184
01:00:51,355 --> 01:00:54,312
Am I being given the hard sell
by their priest?

185
01:00:54,474 --> 01:00:57,194
No. You're getting it
from Danny Machin.

186
01:00:57,355 --> 01:00:59,186
Who the fuck's Danny Machin?

187
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,834
Who the fuck is Danny Machin?

188
01:01:00,995 --> 01:01:03,555
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you who Danny Machin is.

189
01:01:03,716 --> 01:01:05,593
He's the answer to your prayers.

190
01:01:05,756 --> 01:01:08,633
He's the boy can make
your dreams come true.

191
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:11,468
Now, it can be the best wet dream
you ever had.

192
01:01:11,636 --> 01:01:14,355
Or your worst fucking nightmare.

193
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:17,507
I can rip your head off
and shit down your throat.

194
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:20,588
- It's up to you.
- [whimpering]

195
01:01:23,236 --> 01:01:26,830
- Welcome to the label.
- [all cheering, laughing]

196
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:31,104
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

197
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:50,225
Now, I want postcards from every gig.

198
01:01:50,396 --> 01:01:52,035
With all the lurid details.

199
01:01:52,197 --> 01:01:53,630
- No problem.
- Thanks for everything, Karl.

200
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:56,151
And don't worry, we'll get you
VIP passes when we play Wembley.

201
01:01:56,316 --> 01:01:58,068
- Access all areas.
- Ah!

202
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:00,956
I'll make you sorry you ever said that.

203
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:04,905
Now, boys. A word to the wise
from an old man before you go.

204
01:02:05,077 --> 01:02:07,068
Remember only this.

205
01:02:07,238 --> 01:02:11,674
The measure of a man is what's left
when fame falls away.

206
01:02:11,837 --> 01:02:13,668
Hmm?

207
01:02:13,837 --> 01:02:14,986
Oh, and another thing.

208
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:17,274
Get as much sex as you can.

209
01:02:19,477 --> 01:02:21,274
There's no problem there at all, Karl.

210
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,552
- Love you.
- Thanks, Karl.

211
01:02:22,717 --> 01:02:24,117
- [telephone ringing]
- Take care.

212
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:26,428
- Oh, I'll just get that.
- Leave it, man.

213
01:02:26,598 --> 01:02:27,996
It might be mam.

214
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:39,868
Yeah.

215
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:42,189
You can run but you can't hide,
McCormick.

216

01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,715
Yeah, well, apparently
they've this Irish quota.

219
01:02:47,879 --> 01:02:50,712
It's one out, one in. And seeing as U2
are on telly every night,

220
01:02:50,878 --> 01:02:52,596
I'll have to kill you to get my turn.

221
01:02:52,758 --> 01:02:54,111
Kill Bono?

222
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:56,235
I know a few people
that would wear that t-shirt.

223
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,390

Yeah, let me guess.

228
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:08,555
The fame went to your head
and you thought you could fly.

229
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:10,394
Got it in one.

230
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,994
Right off stage.
Popped my arm out of its socket.

231
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,356
So, now you need me to come
and take over as front man for U2?

232
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:18,191
Well, OK. Seeing as it's you.

233
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,439
Not exactly.

234
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,590
But I was gonna ask if you'd
open for us in Dublin?

235
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,355
Get to fuck, you gobshite.

236
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,033
You mean support U2?

237
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,430
Well, we're doing Croke Park
at the end of June, and I thought,

238
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,318
you know, when we tour we like to
support local bands, you know?

239
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:35,552
Well, so... so technically you would be
supporting us then?

240
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,914
McCormick.

241
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,674
Look, we'd be supporting each other.
Like the old days.

242
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,876
Yeah, listen, Bono.

243
01:03:42,761 --> 01:03:45,434
We are just playing our own tour
at the moment.

244
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:49,832
Just a few UK dates and Europe.

245
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,878
We got ourselves signed too,
you know?

246
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:55,077
Hey, congratulations, man.
I never doubted you for a minute.

247
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,073
Thanks.

248
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,112
I mean...

249
01:04:00,281 --> 01:04:02,112

to five hundred of our own fans

252
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:12,916
than fifty thousand of yours,
you know?

253
01:04:15,282 --> 01:04:17,159
Well, so that's a no?

254
01:04:23,522 --> 01:04:25,433
Yeah.

255
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:30,160
Look, I've got to go, Neil.
Talk to you later.

256
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:47,995
Oh, nice of you to join.
Who was that, then?

257
01:04:48,163 --> 01:04:50,676
Uh... Mam. She wishes us luck.

could have been the fifth member.

No, that's bollocks. It was just some

Bono said he wanted you in the band.

- What, Bono said that?
- Yeah.

305

You wanted to stick with family.

And he heard it straight from Bono.

321
01:07:57,169 --> 01:07:58,887
So, are you telling me it's a lie?

322

No. So, give me the truth.

We were kids.

324

What do you want me to say?

325
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:18,843

- Yes. Yes!

326

you turned down,

turns to shite.

Sorry that you made
the worst decision of my life!

Well, I'm not sorry, Ivan.
Listen to me.

I'm not sorry for knowing all along
that we could make it on our own.

I'm not sorry that every shitty decision
I ever made has brought us here.

Yeah, I know. I've just been...

01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:28,587
I've been busy with the tour
and that and...

580

How's Neil?

581
01:23:31,237 --> 01:23:32,830
Fucked, frankly.

582
01:23:32,998 --> 01:23:35,307
He's been living like a tramp.
We haven't seen him for days

583
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:37,513
and I just had some hard arse round
looking for him.

- Some kid.</i>

off. Is he in some kind of trouble?

[faint chatter]

588
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:53,276
How are ya, Niall?

589
01:23:53,438 --> 01:23:57,751
I'm just trying to track down Bono.
Do you know where he is?

590
01:23:57,919 --> 01:24:00,796
The bands just back in town for the gig.
They're rehearsing down at the factory

591
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:02,789
and then they're holed up at
the Stanford doing press.

592
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,597
- Great.
- Morning, Gary.

593
01:24:04,759 --> 01:24:06,192
How's Grace Jones?

594
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:09,270
Fucking terrifying.
What's he doing here?

595
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:11,235
Gary. Still writing
poof pieces for Bono

596
01:24:11,398 --> 01:24:13,310
with your pen in one hand
and your prick in the other?

597
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:16,755
Could always do another piece on you.
The refugee from rock bottom.

598
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:19,433
I think you've done enough damage
after the last time.

599
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:22,470
And anyway it might be the best thing
that has ever happened,

600
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:26,348
because I am back here
to support... U2.

601
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,591

602
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,113
Neil McCormick here to see Bono.

603
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,474
He's working.
He don't take social calls.

604
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:35,152
You're not press, are ya?

605
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:38,471
- I hate fucking press.
- Yeah, me too.

606
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,789
I hate press.

607
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,951
I'm not press. I'm a friend of his,
we're... good mates.

608
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,112
Everyone in Dublin says that.

609
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,554
Well, what do you want me to do?

610
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,711
Flash my "I went to school
with Bono" card?

611

we're supporting U2?

614
01:25:00,201 --> 01:25:02,761
Well, that's what Neil said.
Are you telling me he was having us on?

615
01:25:02,921 --> 01:25:05,992
Maybe. I don't know?
It's news to bloody me, you know?

616
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,912
I just don't know what's going on
in Neil's head.

617
01:25:08,081 --> 01:25:11,039
Well, he was acting a bit mental.
More so than usual, that is.

618
01:25:11,201 --> 01:25:14,078
- And did he say where he was going?
- Sure, he was on the hunt for Bono.

<i>Neil McCormick. Hot Press.</i>

Bono's not registered with us, sir.

No, he's not a guest.
He's with the band.

They're here for the press conference.

The band? And what band
would that be now?

625
01:25:31,321 --> 01:25:32,675
I'll give you a clue.

Oh, right, Bono.
Bono is not registered with us.

629
01:25:41,522 --> 01:25:44,513
Listen to me, you little tight arse.
We both know he's in the building.

630
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,797
There's a small army
of U2 fans outside.

631
01:25:46,961 --> 01:25:49,112
So, just tell me the way
to the fucking conference.

632

touring the world?

Yeah, well, it's a long story.

Listen, while I have you, I did
just wanna firm up our support gig.

640
01:26:06,723 --> 01:26:09,031
- The one you turned down?
- Yeah, yeah. That's the one.

641
01:26:09,202 --> 01:26:11,558
Listen, I've had a bit of a rethink
and count me in.

642
01:26:11,723 --> 01:26:15,556
Sorry, Neil. You said no. Call him crazy
but Bono did take that as a no.

- Paul.

Yeah. I had myself going.

681
01:28:48,287 --> 01:28:50,643
[Bono] I spoke to McGuiness.
He said he looked pretty rough.

682
01:28:50,808 --> 01:28:54,356
I'd no idea it'd got so bad.
Maybe he finally flipped?

No, no. I'm fine about that.

Just... just lie down

01:29:53,569 --> 01:29:56,642
and let my little brother get snapped up
by the competition? No, no.

704
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:58,959
Well, Neil wouldn't let me have you.
And I don't blame him.

705
01:29:59,129 --> 01:30:01,518
I mean, if you were my brother
I wouldn't have let you join

706
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:05,239
- some other shitty garage band.
- Oh, shit. You were U2.

707
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:08,208
We didn't know that.
None of us did.

708
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:10,931
- And we were pretty shitty.
- Yeah.

709
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:16,284
I had it all planned out.
Form a band.

710
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:19,921
Given the choice, would you
really have picked us over him?

711
01:30:20,091 --> 01:30:22,206
Release a series
of ground-breaking albums.

712
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:24,520
I'd wanna say, yes.

713
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:26,090
Tour the world's greatest stadiums.

714
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:29,560
But could you... have picked us
over your own brother?

715
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:32,642
Pull off the biggest rock and roll
invasion of America since the Beatles.

716

This was my life. Just waiting to happen
and all I had to do was live it.

717

Him.

719

Well, if you've got a problem, why
don't you just do something about it?

720
01:30:50,732 --> 01:30:52,450
Oh, yeah? What?

721
01:30:52,612 --> 01:30:54,442
What, what?
What should I do about it?

722
01:30:56,251 --> 01:30:58,402

- [shouting]
- [car horn honking]

726
01:31:09,252 --> 01:31:10,844
- Neil!
- [Neil screams]

727
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:13,608
- [screaming continues]
- [Plugger] Neil! Neil!

728
01:31:13,773 --> 01:31:14,888
[both grunting]

729
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:20,007
Look, it's just a shame you can't
support us on Saturday.

730
01:31:20,172 --> 01:31:21,242
What?

731
01:31:21,413 --> 01:31:23,881
We offered you a support slot,
you said no.

732
01:31:24,653 --> 01:31:26,210
What?

733
01:31:26,372 --> 01:31:29,126
- [crowd cheering]
- [grunting]

734
01:31:29,813 --> 01:31:33,088
- He didn't tell you?
- No. He didn't tell me.

735
01:31:35,252 --> 01:31:36,844
[panting]

736
01:31:37,453 --> 01:31:39,603
Would you be willing to repeat this
in a court of law?

737
01:31:39,773 --> 01:31:41,331
On behalf of the defence?

738
01:31:47,054 --> 01:31:48,203
- Whose defence?
- [Ivan] Mine.

739
01:31:48,374 --> 01:31:50,807
Because I'm going to
bleeding murder him.

740
01:31:50,973 --> 01:31:53,568
[coughing, groaning]

741
01:32:14,894 --> 01:32:16,613
OK, I guess this is it.
Are you ready?

742
01:32:16,775 --> 01:32:18,413
[woman screams]

743
01:32:19,415 --> 01:32:21,166
[women screaming]

744
01:32:21,334 --> 01:32:24,850
- [scoffs] For my 15 seconds of fame?
- Enough to put you off forever.

745
01:32:27,415 --> 01:32:30,850
Get out of me fucking way.
You out of the way, now. Come on.

746
01:32:31,014 --> 01:32:33,768
- Bono. Bono.
- [fans screaming]

747
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:54,845
Neil McCormick.
I'm a friend of the band's.

748
01:32:55,015 --> 01:32:57,610
I should be under
Paul McGuinness's list.

749
01:32:57,776 --> 01:33:00,006
- OK, go straight in.
- Thanks.

750
01:33:01,775 --> 01:33:04,084

- [fans clamouring]

[continues muttering]

01:36:09,982 --> 01:36:11,494
[grunting]

763
01:36:12,661 --> 01:36:15,051
Neil. What the fuck are you doing?

764
01:36:15,222 --> 01:36:16,575
Ivan.

765
01:36:17,662 --> 01:36:20,653
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be on tour.

766
01:36:20,821 --> 01:36:23,211
Yeah, I know. I came back for you,
you dickhead.

767
01:36:24,622 --> 01:36:26,340
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but...

768
01:36:26,502 --> 01:36:29,335
...I'm an idiot because...
What happened to your face?

769
01:36:29,502 --> 01:36:32,495
Never mind. Because I found out
about the U2 gig.

770
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:34,381
- Oh.
- Oh.

771
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:37,454
You turned down U2, Neil. Again.

772
01:36:37,622 --> 01:36:41,218
On my behalf, again,
without telling me.

773
01:36:41,943 --> 01:36:43,170
Again.

774
01:36:43,342 --> 01:36:45,492
I just wanted us to do it on our own.

775
01:36:45,662 --> 01:36:49,622
Why does everything that we ever do
always have to come back to them?

776
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:52,501
It's like some sick cosmic joke!

777
01:36:55,263 --> 01:36:58,221
Have you heard this song? I mean,
is he taking the piss now or what?

778
01:36:58,383 --> 01:37:02,012
He still hasn't found what he's looking
for. He's got everything he ever wanted.

779
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:05,142
No, he's got everything
that you ever wanted.

780
01:37:05,304 --> 01:37:06,577
How do you know what he wants?

781
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:10,213
I mean, you're going on about him
like he's a fifty foot, singing genie

782
01:37:10,384 --> 01:37:13,182
that you can't shove
back in the bottle. No!

783
01:37:13,344 --> 01:37:15,493
He's Bono.

784
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:19,896
He's just Paul Hewson grown up.
And you need to get over it,

785
01:37:20,064 --> 01:37:21,577
and get yourself to-fucking-gether,

786
01:37:21,744 --> 01:37:24,860
so we can play this gig
and steal their thunder.

787
01:37:27,024 --> 01:37:29,618
It's not happening. I spoke to
McGuinness. The gig is off.

788
01:37:29,784 --> 01:37:32,617
Well, I told Bono that we'd do it.

789
01:37:34,625 --> 01:37:36,343
What?

790
01:37:36,505 --> 01:37:38,176
Even though you've
bollocksed it up again,

791
01:37:38,344 --> 01:37:40,255
and probably don't deserve it,

792
01:37:40,424 --> 01:37:41,652
it is on.

793
01:37:41,824 --> 01:37:43,178
All you got to do is sing, man.

794
01:37:43,345 --> 01:37:45,381
It's four numbers.
Just like back at school.

795
01:37:45,545 --> 01:37:47,057
[both] We're supporting U2!

796
01:37:48,424 --> 01:37:50,143
We're supporting U...

797
01:37:51,145 --> 01:37:52,134
...2.

798
01:37:55,104 --> 01:37:56,776
- What the fuck is that?
- Just leave it, never mind.

799
01:37:56,944 --> 01:37:58,822
What do you mean, never mind?
There was a firearm

800
01:37:58,985 --> 01:38:00,737
shoved down the front of your trousers.

801
01:38:01,705 --> 01:38:04,265
What would you have done if I wasn't
here? What's the plan, Neil?

802
01:38:04,425 --> 01:38:06,576
Come down and stick that thing
to Bono's head?

803
01:38:06,746 --> 01:38:09,862
- Don't be stupid.
- That's what it looks like, genius!

804
01:38:10,025 --> 01:38:12,334
Like a complete nut job
trying to solve all his problems

805
01:38:12,505 --> 01:38:14,337
by coming in here and killing Bono.

806
01:38:14,506 --> 01:38:16,224
[toilet flushes]

807
01:38:34,266 --> 01:38:36,143
No.

808
01:38:38,867 --> 01:38:40,983
There's two lads
in the toilet with a gun.

809
01:38:42,346 --> 01:38:45,258
- I think we should probably leave now.
- Yeah, I think you're probably right.

810
01:38:46,187 --> 01:38:47,666
No, fuck it. Go.

811
01:38:47,827 --> 01:38:49,657
- Move, move!
- [people screaming]

812
01:38:49,826 --> 01:38:50,975
[man] Get out of here.

813
01:38:52,546 --> 01:38:54,219
Neil!

814
01:38:55,627 --> 01:38:56,696
[shouts]

815
01:38:56,867 --> 01:38:58,379
What do you think I am? Stupid?

816
01:38:59,386 --> 01:39:00,899
Right, come here...

817
01:39:01,066 --> 01:39:02,625
Piss off.

818
01:39:02,787 --> 01:39:04,061
Ah, right.

819
01:39:04,227 --> 01:39:05,785
[shouting]

820
01:39:05,947 --> 01:39:08,222
Jump in.
You've business with Mr. Machin.

821
01:39:08,387 --> 01:39:09,946
No, no, no, Plugger. Wait.

822
01:39:10,108 --> 01:39:12,417
We got the gig.
We're supporting U2.

823
01:39:12,588 --> 01:39:14,066
Is that what do you think I am?
Stupid?

824
01:39:14,227 --> 01:39:16,536
I take it that's why you had the gun?

825
01:39:16,707 --> 01:39:20,496
So... fill me in, brother.

826
01:39:20,668 --> 01:39:23,625
How much are we into
Danny Machin for?

827
01:39:23,787 --> 01:39:25,061
All in all?

828
01:39:25,228 --> 01:39:27,742
- Thirteen grand, give or take.
- Thirteen grand?

829
01:39:27,908 --> 01:39:30,740
What is that, five grand a kneecap
and three for our heads?

830
01:39:31,587 --> 01:39:33,897
- That doesn't add up, Ivan.
- I don't care!

831
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:36,059
I should be on top of the world
but now I'm gonna die.

832
01:39:36,228 --> 01:39:37,946
And it's your fault.

833
01:39:38,108 --> 01:39:39,177
Again!

834
01:39:39,508 --> 01:39:41,147
[tyres screech]

835
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:53,262
Got them.

836
01:39:53,868 --> 01:39:55,142
- [screams]
- Don't shoot me!

837
01:39:55,308 --> 01:39:57,504
- Get 'em out.
- [dog growling]

838
01:39:57,669 --> 01:40:00,308
- Mr. Machin!
- Let's get this over with.

839
01:40:00,789 --> 01:40:02,779
Mr. Machin,
you've got to believe us.

840
01:40:02,948 --> 01:40:05,417
We've landed a really, really,
really massive gig.

841
01:40:08,389 --> 01:40:10,425
Sit the fuck down.

842
01:40:11,349 --> 01:40:13,818
The press want to bury me.

843
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:16,867
It's a fucking witch-hunt!

844
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:34,823
And I'm calling in all debts.

845
01:40:34,989 --> 01:40:36,502
Well...

846
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:40,908
We can't pay but...
but if you just maybe give us some...

847
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:45,349
I'm not giving anything!
No more fucking favours!

848
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:51,260
Now you're not leaving here,
till you pay me back.

849
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:57,385
And if you can't pay me back,
you're not leaving at all.

850
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:02,782
We're really gonna die.

851
01:41:02,951 --> 01:41:06,784
Now, Plugger here tells me
you were a journalist.

852
01:41:06,950 --> 01:41:10,023
<i>Uh, yeah. Yeah, rock critic
for Hot Press.</i>

853
01:41:10,191 --> 01:41:11,510
A few bits for the school mag.

854
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:13,468
I tell you, my Pulitzer Prize
is still a ways off, I...

855
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:16,191
Shut up, Neil. Neil's just
being modest, Mr. Machin.

856
01:41:16,352 --> 01:41:17,705
He's a great writer.
He's brilliant.

857
01:41:17,872 --> 01:41:19,988
It's his calling.
Isn't that right, Neil?

858
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:25,462
Yeah. Yeah.

859
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:28,384
My calling. You need someone
with press credentials.

860
01:41:28,551 --> 01:41:31,019
Someone to tell your side of the story.
Set the record straight.

861
01:41:31,191 --> 01:41:32,625
The man behind the myth,
kind of thing.

862
01:41:32,792 --> 01:41:35,226
Without bias, without agenda.

863
01:41:39,711 --> 01:41:41,862
Oh, there's an agenda, all right.

864
01:41:43,392 --> 01:41:45,383
I assume you want to live?

865
01:41:47,192 --> 01:41:49,753
OK. So you do this thing for me.
You write my story,

866
01:41:49,913 --> 01:41:52,984
you sell it to the papers
and you pay me back every penny.

867
01:41:53,152 --> 01:41:55,905
You can ask me anything you like.
But you stay here and you write

868
01:41:56,073 --> 01:41:58,143
till you're finished and it better be
good enough to publish.

869
01:41:58,313 --> 01:41:59,826
Hang on.
We can't stay here.

870
01:41:59,992 --> 01:42:01,471
Like we said,
we've got this big gig on...

871
01:42:01,632 --> 01:42:04,227
You're not going anywhere,
you daft bollock.

872
01:42:04,393 --> 01:42:07,510
Either of you.
You can sharpen his pencils.

873
01:42:07,673 --> 01:42:09,742
- [typewriter clacking]
- [dog barks]

874
01:42:14,633 --> 01:42:16,510
- Come on.
- Will you stop your pacing?

875
01:42:16,673 --> 01:42:19,107
I can't. We're supposed to be
sound checking right now.

876
01:42:19,273 --> 01:42:21,834
You were the one that convinced him
this was such a great idea.

877
01:42:21,994 --> 01:42:25,952
In what fucking universe
is this my fault?

878
01:42:26,113 --> 01:42:29,151
You have a gift.
Never mind the pop star bollocks.

879
01:42:29,314 --> 01:42:32,988
You could be the next James Joyce.
Only with better punctuation.

880
01:42:33,153 --> 01:42:35,303
- [sirens approaching]
- Oh, here we go.

881
01:42:35,473 --> 01:42:38,227
We may not have time to finish this.

882
01:42:40,753 --> 01:42:43,108
- Will we take the Land Rover?
- You take it.

883
01:42:47,354 --> 01:42:48,867
Right, lads. Let's go.

884
01:42:49,034 --> 01:42:53,028
And if I don't see your piece
in the papers by the weekend...

885
01:42:53,195 --> 01:42:57,187
...it's bath time with Plugger.
Understand?

886
01:43:04,874 --> 01:43:07,024
Come on. Machin's in there.

887
01:43:09,835 --> 01:43:11,665
Go, go, go, go, go!

888
01:43:16,115 --> 01:43:18,071
- Don't move!
- Right, fucking don't move!

889
01:43:18,235 --> 01:43:19,384
[all yelling]

890
01:43:19,555 --> 01:43:21,910
Seamus. Ronan.

891
01:43:26,876 --> 01:43:28,274
Right, lads.
Get ready to jump out.

892
01:43:28,435 --> 01:43:30,391
Dublin road's just over that hill.

893
01:43:30,555 --> 01:43:33,514
It's been rock and roll, lads.
Now bugger off outta here.

894
01:43:33,676 --> 01:43:35,313
- What, here?
- Yeah.

895
01:43:35,875 --> 01:43:38,025
- It's in the middle of nowhere.
- Piss off!

896
01:43:38,195 --> 01:43:39,629
Plugger!

897
01:43:41,116 --> 01:43:42,390
I'm fucking freezing.

898
01:43:43,315 --> 01:43:45,067
This way, is it?

899
01:43:46,475 --> 01:43:48,114
[Ivan groans]

900
01:43:51,556 --> 01:43:54,070
[sheep bleating]

901
01:43:54,236 --> 01:43:56,467
[Neil laughing]

902
01:43:57,117 --> 01:43:59,107
- What's so funny?
- Being alive.

903
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:01,267
It's fucking absurd but it's great,
isn't it?

904
01:44:01,436 --> 01:44:02,425
Yeah.

905
01:44:03,757 --> 01:44:06,146
Do you reckon that's the Dublin bus?

906
01:44:06,317 --> 01:44:07,590
If it is, we still might make the gig.

907
01:44:07,756 --> 01:44:09,189
No, we're miles away,
we'll never make it.

908
01:44:09,356 --> 01:44:11,552
Yeah, of course we'll make it.
We can do anything we wanna do.

909
01:44:11,717 --> 01:44:12,911
Be anything we wanna be.

910
01:44:13,077 --> 01:44:15,192
- Will you just shut up and run?
- Right.

911
01:44:15,876 --> 01:44:17,229
I just want you to know...

912
01:44:17,396 --> 01:44:19,865
I never doubted us for a second.
I never doubted we'd make it.

913
01:44:20,037 --> 01:44:22,597
- We're not there yet.
- Oh, trust me, we'll get there.

914
01:44:22,757 --> 01:44:25,510
I can feel it. It's meant to be.
[screams]
