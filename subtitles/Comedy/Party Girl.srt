1
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:00,737
Miss Ginger D'Amour.

2
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,554
Miss Cindy Consuelo.

3
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:09,114
Miss Joy Hampton.

4
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:11,784
And another of Chicago's favorites.

5
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:13,876
Miss Vicki Gaye.

6
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:39,906
Put her on the list.

7
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:45,514
What about this one? Will she go?

8
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,331
Expensive merchandise, Louis.

9
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:51,690
The boss ain't buying them.
He's just inviting them to a party.

10
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,693
Rico's party.

11
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:16,271
Rico Angelo is throwing a party.
You get a hundred bucks for showing up.

12
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:30,015
Rico Angelo. King of the rackets.

13
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:31,539
Royalty.

14
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,721
Are you going?
─ Uhuh.

15
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,795
I've been out with the mob before.

16
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:38,117
Most of the time all
they want to do is ..

17
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:39,835
Wave their cash around.

18
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:43,190
By the end of the evening, they're
usually too drunk for anything else.

19
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,578
It's a hundred dollars.

20
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:48,696
I want to stay home tonight.
Eddie might call.

21
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:49,945
Yeah.

22
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,538
Like he did last night?

23
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,979
I heard you walking the floor
until 5 o'clock this morning.

24
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,132
How long since you've heard from him?

25
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:02,232
Three weeks.

26
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:03,897
Almost a month.

27
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:05,938
Vicki, what am I going to do?

28
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:07,421
Call him.

29
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,708
Or find someone without a wife.

30
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,095
But the divorce was
all set. He told me it was.

31
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:14,516
Thanks, Joy.

32
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,486
Keep your hands out of my things or
I'll pull your hair out by the roots!

33
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:18,772
Listen, chubby.

34
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,952
Put on more pounds and you won't be
round long enough to tear anyone's hair.

35
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,440
Let her alone, won't you.

36
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:30,516
Look Joy .. go on home.

37
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,332
I'll try not to be late.

38
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:33,794
And remember.

39
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,818
It's only a man.

40
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:37,792
Only a man.

41
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:39,931
How do you do it, Vicki?

42
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:42,293
I made up my mind a long time ago.

43
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,441
Never get crowded into a corner.

44
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,512
Never let them get too close.

45
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:51,354
After a while .. they go away.

46
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:54,684
You've never been in that
corner, with your looks?

47
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:57,106
Just once.

48
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,874
In a dark and dirty little bar
back home in Oklahoma.

49
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:04,183
I was fifteen.

50
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:06,845
Very romantic.

51
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,243
Go on in, baby.

52
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,915
Rico Angelo. Make yourself at home.

53
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,660
Come on Rico, what do you say?

54
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:25,043
It's a party.

55
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,173
Forget her. She means
nothing to you anyway.

56
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,368
The most beautiful doll
in the world. That's all.

57
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,741
Hey boss, we're doing okay, huh?

58
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,340
Girls, come on over here.
Meet Mr Rico Angelo.

59
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:36,904
Hello Mr Angelo.

60
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,169
This is lucky Louis.
─ Louis Canetto.

61
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:41,289
Hiya, Puss.

62
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,366
The coat goes in the bedroom.

63
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,583
Wowee.
─ Salary.

64
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:57,318
What was that act for?

65
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,591
You know, with the photograph.

66
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:01,744
It's a picture of Jean Harlow.

67
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:03,815
The movie star, Jean Harlow?

68
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:05,948
She got married today out in Hollywood.

69
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,366
Mr Angelo is giving
a party to forget her.

70
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,499
Forget her?

71
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,708
Did he ever meet her?

72
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,946
No. But he's seen every
one of her movies.

73
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,793
He'd been carrying a torch for her.

74
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,839
The way he figures it,
she double-crossed him.

75
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:21,496
Well, that makes sense.

76
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:25,181
It's going to be an evening. I can tell.

77
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,250
Hey, come on kids.

78
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,982
Hurry it up, let's mingle a little.

79
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,227
There's nice guys out there.
They want to say hello.

80
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,979
Move along now. Come on,
kids. What do you say?

81
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:46,989
I wish I could find a
safe place for this.

82
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,010
Come on, just one time.

83
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,305
Come on! Let's go!

84
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,432
Stay close to me, Puss.
You're bringing me luck.

85
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,193
Shoot the five hundred.

86
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,445
Come on. Five open. Spread it out.

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,010
A pleasure to meet you, Counselor.
Particularly outside my courtroom.

88
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,999
You usually cause a little
difficulty for me there.

89
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,020
My job is to convince
the jury, Your Honor.

90
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:13,837
Not to make life
comfortable for the judge.

91
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,346
Come on baby, try it again.

92
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,318
Eight and one. Come on, dice.

93
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:21,241
Six.

94
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,090
Try again.

95
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,496
Thirty three, let's go. Six it is.

96
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,279
That's four hundred you got already.

97
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:32,429
Any part of it. Any part of it.

98
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:35,308
Don't get too far away, Puss.
We got some talking to do later.

99
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,050
[ Gunshot! ]

100
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:43,587
Nice shooting, Rico.

101
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:46,016
Where'd you get her?
Between the eyes?

102
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,280
I'll see you some other time.

103
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:52,103
Well, I took care of her.

104
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,511
She had it coming, Tommy.

105
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,557
She had it coming.

106
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,619
You're drunk, Rico.
Sodden, stupid drunk.

107
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,737
Ah, don't ride me.

108
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:05,855
I .. what are you all looking at?

109
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,934
Huh? Come on, it’s a party. Get going.

110
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:10,047
It's a party!

111
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,440
I got her out of my system.

112
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,087
Oh, I feel better already.

113
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,486
Congratulations.

114
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,052
Do you think Rico is drunk? Huh?

115
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:21,914
You catch me later.

116
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:25,210
Come on, what I'm talking
about now is a party. It's a party!

117
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:26,633
Come on, dice.

118
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,506
Pass the dice.

119
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,027
Hello.

120
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:47,445
Would you like to take me home?

121
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,330
Not particularly. Why?

122
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:52,373
Would you dance with me?

123
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:53,861
It's only a dance.

124
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:00,539
It would get me near the door.
It wouldn't kill you.

125
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,930
Why don't you give Louis his money back?
That would get you off the hook

126
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,906
You don't miss very much, do you?

127
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:11,841
Just a minute. I'm going
anyway. I'll take you.

128
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:16,753
Can I help you, Mr Farrell?

129
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,154
Let him alone. Let him alone!

130
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:20,509
Nobody helps when Rico's around.

131
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,016
You okay, boy?

132
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,557
I'm taking this girl home, Louis.

133
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,472
Sure.

134
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:35,892
Sure, Mr Farrell.

135
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,129
Would you like to come in for a minute?

136
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:54,130
There is not much in the icebox but
I could make you some .. cocoa.

137
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:55,891
Cocoa?

138
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:59,184
Haven't had any cocoa
since I was nine years old.

139
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:01,547
Maybe you got a new recipe.

140
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:11,357
I should have told you.

141
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:12,851
I have a roommate.

142
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,939
Joy .. man on the premises.

143
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,710
Joy?

144
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:32,094
Sit down.

145
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:41,355
That was quite a picnic tonight.

146
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:42,896
It had its moments.

147
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,422
For me particularly.

148
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:46,635
Mr Canetto was getting to be a problem.

149
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,235
It wouldn't have been if
you'd known all the facts.

150
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,422
Mr Canetto can't get out
of line. He's out on bail.

151
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,602
Mr Canetto goes on trial for
murder this coming Thursday.

152
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,086
A murderer?

153
00:10:58,262 --> 00:10:59,672
He seemed a little scared of you.

154
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:01,580
He has to be. I'm defending him.

155
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,551
I haven't told you my name.

156
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:06,879
Vicki Gaye.

157
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,032
I heard someone mention it.

158
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:11,838
Been in Chicago long?
─ A few months.

159
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:16,500
Three years.

160
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,791
What did you do before you were
glamorized by The Golden Rooster?

161
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:22,034
Dance a little.

162
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:23,333
No talent?

163
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:25,303
I think so.

164
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:26,530
No takers.

165
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,345
So you gave it up?

166
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:30,160
It was that or give up eating.

167
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:31,685
And then?

168
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:33,421
Modeling.

169
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:35,121
Modeling for what?

170
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,178
Calendar art? Girlie magazines?

171
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:38,949
Tell me when I'm warm.

172
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:40,460
It seems I don't have to.

173
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,606
Bad?

174
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:46,243
It's nothing.

175
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:47,488
Excuse me.

176
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:55,114
Joy.

177
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:56,597
Joy.

178
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,809
Do you know any reason
she would slit her wrists?

179
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:09,952
Did you know she was
three months pregnant?

180
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,285
Who was the guy? Come
on honey, who was it?

181
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,540
Come on, come on.

182
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:19,531
You don't live a year with a kid without
knowing who's taking care of her.

183
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,495
That's enough. No more questions.

184
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,280
Are you running this, mister?

185
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,198
Anything else you want to know,
she'll answer tomorrow in my office.

186
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:29,822
Thomas Farrell. Is that you?

187
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:32,003
She'll need a sedative
before she leaves.

188
00:12:33,145 --> 00:12:34,147
Get her some water.

189
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:35,705
Sure, Mr Farrell.

190
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,344
You can't go back to your
place yet. Do you want a hotel?

191
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,837
Anything.

192
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,223
Over there.

193
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:11,288
I'll go and see about that cocoa.

194
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,318
It will probably taste more like
brandy and coffee, but it might help.

195
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:17,910
If I'd been there.

196
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:20,704
If I'd gone home tonight.

197
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:24,440
She'd be alive now.

198
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:26,470
Probably.

199
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,554
But what about tomorrow night?

200
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:29,733
The night after that?

201
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,747
Self-destruction among showgirls
seems to be a kind of ..

202
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:35,327
Occupational hazard.

203
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:38,445
Probably the cheery
atmosphere of nightclub life.

204
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,523
By the way, our genial host
of the evening, Mr Rico Angelo.

205
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,049
Owns a sizable piece
of The Golden Rooster.

206
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:47,279
He might be able to
do something for you.

207
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:49,227
Seeing you're a dancer.

208
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:51,524
For which I'll take your word.

209
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:55,797
You might prefer that to
parading around half-naked.

210
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:51,109
This is a copy of your medical
report, Rico. I'll leave it with you.

211
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,969
When Louis goes on trial, in case
you get summoned as a witness.

212
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:55,934
You'll be too sick to show up.
That will prove it.

213
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:57,301
What have I got?

214
00:14:57,555 --> 00:14:59,186
Incipient general paralysis.

215
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:02,063
That sounds high class.

216
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,004
High class and probably very true.

217
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,596
Hey, where you going?

218
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:08,372
Come here. Sit down. Eat something.

219
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,808
I handle your business for you, Rico.
I'll even protect your hoods for you.

220
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:14,241
But I refuse to eat with you.

221
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:16,127
Why?

222
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:17,972
You're a slob.

223
00:15:20,323 --> 00:15:22,481
A slob. How do you like that?
Did you hear what he said?

224
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,958
Shut up.

225
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,755
And there is one more thing.

226
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,360
Outside, Louis.

227
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:38,257
There's a girl, Vicki Gaye,
works at The Golden Rooster.

228
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,219
I'd like her to have a better job.

229
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,004
Okay. Make a note.

230
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,872
That leg of yours. It don't stop
you from nothing, does it.

231
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:51,312
Don't get sore at Rico.

232
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:54,856
Fix a job for her.
Don't mention my name.

233
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:02,861
"Expect Canetto to face chair."

234
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,129
"Guilty verdict for Canetto likely."

235
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,773
"Farrell's final summation today."

236
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,413
Forget that. Anything more?

237
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:13,200
No, the Express isn't out yet.

238
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:16,219
That jury has been pretty cold. It's
going to be tough breaking them down.

239
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:18,143
Forget the jury.
I'll take care of the jury.

240
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,158
Make sure I have those
headlines in court today.

241
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,049
[ Buzzer ]

242
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,590
Yes?

243
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,802
"A Miss Vicki Gaye is here."
─ Send her in.

244
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:27,323
Lou.

245
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:36,535
Hello.

246
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:42,457
Sit down.

247
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,936
Police been bothering you?
─ No.

248
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,730
I wanted to see you.
─ Professionally?

249
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,616
Personally .. I want to
thank you for what you did.

250
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,096
You already thanked me on the phone.

251
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,188
At the club this morning, they said
I was to have a number of my own.

252
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,087
They said that someone ..

253
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,861
I don't know what they told you at the
club. I'm not particularly interested.

254
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:06,271
I'm due back in court in a few
minutes. Was there anything else?

255
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:10,675
Here is the money that Louis
Canetto gave me at the party.

256
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,966
Will you see that he gets it.

257
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,526
That's a very sentimental gesture.

258
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:19,371
But Canetto doesn't need money. What he
needs is a good lawyer and lots of luck.

259
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:21,964
I would still rather give it back.

260
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:22,988
Why?

261
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,571
Maybe I want you to have
a better opinion of me.

262
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:29,737
A girl is entitled to what she can get.

263
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,424
When you sell your pride,
it's tough to put a price on it.

264
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,235
Four hundred dollars isn't very high.

265

[ Door knocks ]

Judge Bookwell presiding.
Take your seats.

Order in the court. No talking.
Order in the court.

Is the defense ready for summation?

00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:24,099
Ready, Your Honor.

Watch that walk.

Gentlemen.

275
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,900
I would like you to look upon the face.

276
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,567
Of a dead man.

277
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:01,953
At this moment, I wouldn't give you
two cents for the life of Louis Canetto.

278
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:07,046
You are also looking
at a defeated attorney.

279
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,704
Defeated not by facts.
Not by the testimony of the ..

00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:13,551
District Attorney's witnesses.

But by circumstances
over which, unfortunately ..

282
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:20,794
You and this court have no jurisdiction.

283
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,304
Take care of this thing
for me, will you?

284
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,628
Thanks.

285

You gentlemen have been
summoned here as intelligent ..

Honest citizens of the state
of Illinois to decide ..

287
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,512
Whether Louis Canetto shall live or die.

288
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:44,327
But you're not making that decision.
That decision has been made for you,

"Guilty verdict for Canetto likely."

That's where this case is
being tried. In the daily press.

Abrogated your sacred
privilege to judge for yourself.

In no uncertain terms, they
have told you what to do.

been defeated by the press.

to the disapproval of the court.

Very well, gentlemen.

You will bear with me for a moment.

I notice that some of you
are looking at my watch.

Not very impressive, is it?

308
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:05,232
But it has a certain.

309
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:06,959
Sentimental value.

310
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:10,755
My father gave me this
watch, when I was a kid.

possible while we examine the facts.

I have never seen a jury so flagrantly
defy the court's instructions.

00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:15,883
Have a drink, Mr Farrell.

327
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,185
He don't drink, you crumb.
Get him some coffee.

328
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:20,403
I'll take it down there, Nick.

329
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:26,581
And what’s the matter with here?

330
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:28,946
The chick. Chicks come first.

331
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:32,102
This .. this isn't an accident?

332
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:34,367
I was in court this afternoon.

333
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,055
Yes, I saw you.

334
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,076
Very interesting.

335
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:40,239
Criminal cases usually are.

336
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:42,662
Let me ask you a question.

337
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:46,724
When I took money from Louis Canetto
you said I was selling my pride.

338
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,653
What makes you so much better than me?
Louis Canetto is a murderer.

339
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:52,440
He's guilty and you know it.

340
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:54,188
And still you got him off.

341
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:55,860
Why?

342
00:22:56,492 --> 00:23:00,112
If a man's dying of cancer he's entitled
to the best medical care he can afford.

343
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:03,355
If he's facing the electric chair
he's entitled to the best lawyer.

344
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:05,901
I'm .. one of the best.

345
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:08,394
And like a competent surgeon,
I get a good fee.

346
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:11,074
You mean your pride
sells higher than mine?

347
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:12,999
That's right. It's my business.

348
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,216
A mouthpiece for the mob.

349
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,356
A guardian angel for punks and gunmen.

350
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,318
You like being that.

351
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:24,182
It wasn't forced upon me. I could have
chosen another branch of the law but ..

352
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:25,886
This was the quickest way.

353
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:28,976
I'm a great believer
in the quickest way.

354
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,289
You may have noticed that I
limp more in front of a jury.

355
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:35,351
Did you notice?

356
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:37,175
Yes.

357
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,534
I do that to get their
sympathy and their pity.

358
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:42,045
And I take their pity and I use it.

359
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,142
Is that what you want .. pity?

360
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:48,033
If it is, you have mine.

361
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:49,627
For a lot of things.

362
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:54,803
Get out of here.

363
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:10,094
Blinkey, open up will you.
─ Okay.

364
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,408
Hiya, Puss.

365
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:28,827
Thank you.

366
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:33,643
Hey, fellahs.

367
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:43,534
Hey, Mr Farrell.

368
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:47,246
That was a pretty good show today. That
business with the watch was very funny.

369
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:48,774
I'm glad I amused you, Louis.

370
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,796
Next time, maybe I'll let you fry.

371
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:55,394
Here.

372
00:24:57,436 --> 00:24:58,553
Keep it as a memento.

373
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:00,761
Thanks.

374
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:02,777
A pretty good day for tips.

375
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:05,584
Hey Nick. Set them up. Another round.

376
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,315
He's out there again.
Third time this week.

377
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,454
He's boozing it up tonight,
though. That's a switch.

378
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:27,134
Doesn't he ever ask you
for a date or anything?

379
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:39,131
And now.

380
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,266
Miss Vicki Gaye!

381
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:41,860
I was brought up in this district.

382
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:47,401
We used to swim down there.
It was a little slimy but it was cool.

383
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,693
When the bridge opened, we used to
hang on to the girders underneath.

384
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,814
The trick was to see who had the
nerve enough to hang on the longest.

385
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:00,799
One day, one of us was a real winner.

386
00:30:02,155 --> 00:30:05,195
But something went wrong. He
slipped and got mixed up in the gears.

387
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:07,810
Like being caught in a meat grinder.

388
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,860
The bones of his hip weren't set
too well. He dragged his left leg.

389
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,271
He didn't mind too much.
He was twelve years old.

390
00:30:18,154 --> 00:30:20,585
In a kind of a way, it made him
a hero with the rest of the gang.

391
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,098
A few years later, when the ..

392
00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:28,284
When other kids were walking their girls
through Hammond park on summer nights.

393
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:32,377
He began to think that somewhere
along the line he'd been cheated.

394
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:42,939
One night I made myself a promise.

395
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,343
That someday, in spite of a crooked
body, I'd be a whole man again.

396
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:49,885
Respected. Admired.

397
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:51,723
Even envied.

398
00:30:53,914 --> 00:30:54,860
That was my goal.

399
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,515
The law was the road to it.

400
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:00,276
Criminal law because
it was the quickest way.

401
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:03,294
I have respect now.

402
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:07,293
There are judges in this
town who are afraid of me.

403
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,128
Politicians who ..

404
00:31:09,977 --> 00:31:11,072
Hate my guts.

405
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,681
But they all respect me.

406
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,134
I got off the road once.

407
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:20,000
I married.

408
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,417
She was a showgirl.

409
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,028
Pampered, spoiled. Very beautiful.

410
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:29,292
Being beautiful, she felt entitled
to anything the world had to offer.

411
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,164
Penthouse apartment. Furs, jewels.

412
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:37,270
I was in love with her.
I enjoyed giving it to her.

413
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:42,560
And then one night I went to her
room and she told me from her ..

414
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:44,323
Sweet-smelling bed.

415
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:48,079
She couldn't bear the
sight of my crookedness.

416
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:51,923
There wasn't any divorce.
That wasn't part of her plan.

417
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,604
I left that night.
I haven't seen her since.

418
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,750
Where is she now?

419
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:00,907
In the apartment.

420
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:04,812
With the furs and the jewels and
a check on the 1st of every month.

421
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:12,780
I wanted to tell you.

422
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:15,179
I wanted you to know.

423
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,212
I'll take you home now.

424
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:12,870
Yes?

425
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:16,477
Hi.
─ Hi.

426
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:20,333
I realize you're an <i>artiste</i> now,
and probably won't be interested.

427
00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:23,457
But there are a couple of
live ones in from St Louis.

428
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,576
No thanks.

429
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,252
I already told one of them
I was behind on my rent.

430
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:29,687
Which I managed to raise
to two hundred dollars.

431
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:31,058
I've got a date.

432
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:34,780
Well .. twelve roses.

433
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:37,781
A whole dozen.

434
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:44,133
He must be loaded.

435
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:02,967
What do you think?
How's it look, pretty good?

436
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:04,161
Fine Mr Tom, sir.

437
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,906
You don't mind working so late?
─ No sir, no sir.

438
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:10,105
May I say it's a real pleasure
to see you like this.

439
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:12,812
I tell you Jessie, it's a real
pleasure to feel like this.

440
00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:16,239
But .. music, will you.
─ Oh, yes sir.

441
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:18,072
We can't do without music.

442
00:34:21,508 --> 00:34:22,310
Uhuh.

443
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,478
Chopin. Nocturnes.

444
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:28,953
What do you think?

445
00:34:29,924 --> 00:34:31,041
Very appropriate.

446
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:33,248
You ever heard it?
─ No sir, I have not.

447
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,315
Neither have I. Let's try it.

[ Buzzer ]

449
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:38,934
Yes, sir.

450
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:45,696
Hello, Jessie.
─ Evening, Miss Vicki.

451
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,511
Happy anniversary.

452
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:56,808
Well, how do you like it?

453
00:34:57,258 --> 00:34:58,461
I did it all myself.

454
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:00,162
Of course, Jessie ..

455
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,870
Arranged the table, bought the flowers.

456
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,739
Cooked the food. Incidentals like that.

457
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:07,529
But I did it all myself.

458
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:09,448
Beautiful.

459
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:10,916
Oh, here.

460
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,668
This is something I really did myself.

461
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,228
What is it, Tommy?
─ Open.

462
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:17,592
It looks very expensive.
─ It is.

463
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:19,513
I thought we had an agreement.

464
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:22,195
All I thought was, how beautiful
it would look on you.

465
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:24,837
I've never given you anything.

466
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:26,699
You never let me.

467
00:35:27,006 --> 00:35:29,654
You had your job, your own apartment.
There was nothing I could do for you.

468
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:32,570
Make an exception. Just this once.

469
00:35:37,942 --> 00:35:38,618

00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:26,937
Yes, Lou. What is it?

Yeah. I'll come as soon as I can.

476

Meet me outside.

A meeting. A dinner.

A dinner .. at 2 o'clock in the morning?

481

That's normal for Rico Angelo.

482
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:00,203
Is anything wrong?

483

There might be if I don't get there.

I'll get you a taxi.

485
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,840
I'll wait here.          ─ No.
─ I want to.

Say, it's a great honor.

00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:36,548
For me to stand here.

488
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:38,704
To honor Frankie Gasto.

489
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:45,653
A hard boy and a vicious boy.

490
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:46,901
And what's more.

491
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,589
A boy you can trust.

492
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,361
For anything that calls
for a boy like that.

493
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:58,246
The last couple of years,
Frankie's done a great job.

494
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,836
Organizing the poor-room collections.

495
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,334
A lot better than all
you mugs put together.

496
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:04,945
Ha ha.

497
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:08,826
So I'd like to present.

498
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:11,324
This little token.

499
00:38:13,262 --> 00:38:15,397
See .. a little pool cue.

500
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:18,932
Engraved with solid silver.

501
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:21,952
From Rico .. to Frankie.

502
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:23,859
Competition.

503
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:28,469
I'm honored.

504
00:38:29,482 --> 00:38:32,450
To present this to Frankie Gasto.
Who's a great guy!

505
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:37,694
You know, he did make a
couple of .. small mistakes.

506
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:41,726
Trying to set up another
organization to take over ..

507
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:43,525
What I built up.

508
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:47,005
Well.

509
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:49,030
That's ambition.

510
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:51,540
Huh?

511
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,679
And a guy that's got ambition
has got something coming.

512
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,101
I could have asked anybody else
to give this to Frankie for me.

513
00:38:59,277 --> 00:39:00,827
I like to do things personally.

514
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,148
From .. Rico to Frankie.

515
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:19,555
Rico .. Rico!

516
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:22,288
You damned fool.

517
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:24,601
He crossed me.

518
00:39:24,982 --> 00:39:26,973
He had it coming. He crossed me.

519
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,238
Get him to a hospital.
No ambulance. Can't wait.

520
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,428
He crossed me. I had to teach him.

521
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,811
If he dies, I'll try
telling that to a jury.

522
00:39:49,635 --> 00:39:50,311
Tommy?

523
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,855
Getting worried about you.

524
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:02,271
It's blood, Tommy.

525
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,424
It isn't mine. That's
all you need to know.

526
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:06,396
[ Telephone ]

527
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:12,550
Hello?
─ Tom?

528
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,513
Gasto pulled through.

529
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,311
He's going to live.

530
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:20,577
Tell Rico to go to Miami.
Wait there until he hears from me.

531
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:22,244
"Right."

532
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:27,284
Don't ever answer either of these
phones. The less you know, the better.

533
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:30,576
Tommy .. get out of it.

534
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,657
Before something happens.

535
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:35,257
Get out now.
─ And do what?

536
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:39,077
Hang out a shingle in some
farm town and wait for clients?

537
00:40:39,532 --> 00:40:41,685
Why not? You could make a living.

538
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:44,341
Sure. They're waiting in line.

539
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,208
All over the country they're waiting in
line for a crippled attorney with a ..

540
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:51,188
Crippled reputation to
draw up their wills.

541
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,527
The difficulty is centered
in this are here.

542
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:19,806
However, there seems to be
some small degree of hope.

543
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:25,887
A set of corrective procedures by Doctor
Karl Linden, Royal Hospital, Stockholm.

544
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,218
Consisting of multiple osteotomies.

545
00:41:29,391 --> 00:41:32,202
Osteotomy is medical jargon
for the breaking of bones.

546
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,802
Then, internal fixations
with wires and screws.

547
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,441
Later, bone grafts.

548
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:39,444
To be done at monthly intervals.

549
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:42,415
A long, tedious procedure.

550
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:45,240
Acute discomfort. Considerable pain.

551
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:49,566
I don't imagine that frightens you.
You're probably used it by now.

552
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,066
The one thing I should I add.

553
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,533
There is no guarantee of success.

554
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:56,958
I'll let you know.

555
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:00,171
I never knew there was pain.

556
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:02,067
You never told me.

557
00:42:03,341 --> 00:42:04,432
You'll go, won't you?

558
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:06,195
No matter how long it takes.

559
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,665
A year away from you?

560
00:42:09,851 --> 00:42:10,992
Whenever you need me.

561
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:12,952
Just turn around and I'll be there.

562
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:17,026
Tommy.

563
00:42:21,423 --> 00:42:23,081
Hello Jessie. Is Mr Farrell home yet?

564
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:25,751
I've been shopping. The most
wonderful kind of shopping.

565
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:29,004
Ask for any place in the whole world and
they give it to you in your two hands.

566
00:42:29,373 --> 00:42:32,189
The doctor said he would have to
relax before the first operation.

567
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,377
What do you think of the French Riviera?

568
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:36,909
The golden hours in Antibes.

569
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:39,725
It is "Antibes" you know. Not Antibes.
I learned that today.

570
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:41,742
Mr Farrell has gone, Miss Vicki.

571
00:42:42,457 --> 00:42:44,010
He went to New York last night.

572
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:46,506
His boat sailed this afternoon.

573
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:48,739
He asked me to give this to you.

574
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:00,978
[ Tommy's voice ]
"So I didn't want to say goodbye."

575
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:03,102
"Please try to understand."

576
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:05,226
"I would like to be alone now."

577
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:08,334
"We have waited so long for each other."

578
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:11,490
"This year will not make
too much difference."

579
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:13,949
"Take care of yourself, darling."

580
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,860
"Write me."

581
00:43:16,337 --> 00:43:17,349
"I love you."

582
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:35,887
Hello.

583
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,309
I wanted to meet you close up.

584
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:41,117
I'm Genevieve Farrell. Tommy's wife.

585
00:43:42,796 --> 00:43:44,156
I should have recognized you.

586
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:49,469
We are sort-of the same type, aren't we.

587
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:53,469
They say that happens. A man
always marries the same girl twice.

588
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:56,990
Of course, he can't marry you,
but that's the general idea.

589
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:01,095
I know about the Stockholm trip
naturally. How is he coming along?

590
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:04,125
Alright.
─ You hear from him regularly?

591
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:05,555
Yes.

592
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:07,474
It's been a long time, hasn't it.

593
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:08,938
I mean, since he left.

594
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,503
Over a year.

595
00:44:12,095 --> 00:44:13,207
I hope it's successful.

596
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:14,926
He's an attractive man, Tommy.

597
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,898
Or would be ..
─ What do you want?

598
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:19,854
I told you. I was curious.
I wondered what you were like.

599
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:21,500
I know what you're like.

600
00:44:22,647 --> 00:44:24,065
You are not in love with Tommy.

601
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:25,951
What are you hanging on for?

602
00:44:26,575 --> 00:44:28,666
I gave up a lot for Tommy
when I married him.

603
00:44:29,606 --> 00:44:32,061
Besides, this operation
might change everything.

604
00:44:36,915 --> 00:44:38,609
I think it's only fair you should know.

605
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:40,055
I've written to Tommy.

606
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:42,935
I told him if things work out,
if he wants me, I'll be waiting.

607
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,320
You had no right.

608
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:48,362
No right? Honey, I'm his wife.

609
00:44:48,724 --> 00:44:49,484
Honey?

610
00:44:50,547 --> 00:44:51,944
You are just married to him.

611
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:35,845
Thank you.

Ah yes, Rico.

622
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:33,180
Well soon. I don't know exactly when.

623
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:36,731
I'm anxious to see you, too.

Yeah, I'll call you.

When I get there.

626
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:47,505
It's Rico's way of saying welcome home.

Eighteen hundred bucks.

628

Good enough?

629
00:47:53,814 --> 00:47:55,309
Rico, we'd better have a little talk.

630
00:47:55,547 --> 00:47:58,095
Oh yeah, we've got a lot of
catching up to do. Later, huh?

631
00:48:01,883 --> 00:48:03,413
Oh hi, Farrell.
─ Louis.

632
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,557
Say, why didn't you bring the chick?

633
00:48:06,213 --> 00:48:07,852
A lot of nice people here tonight.

and say hello to my boy.

Welcome back, Tommy.
─ Thank you, Your Honor.

637
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:19,166
How do you like my boy, huh?

638
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:21,226
He looks fine.
─ It works pretty good, huh?

639
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,927
That cane, in a few months,
he won't even need it.

640
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:24,849
Right, Tommy?

641
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:44,207
I want you to meet somebody.

Oh, everyone's heard of Cookie.

00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:42,467
Excuse me.

650
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,876
Well, Cookie ain't a punk anymore.

651
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:47,793
Him and me, we've kind of merged.

652
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:50,740
He takes care of the southern
part of the state. I operate here.

653
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:51,849
But.

654
00:49:52,184 --> 00:49:53,981
Right now, the reason I
want you to meet him ..

655
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:55,656
Cookie is in kind of a jam.

656
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:58,863
What mischief has Cookie been up to?

657
00:49:59,403 --> 00:50:02,718
Did you ever hear of a smart-aleck
punk named Jeffrey Stewart?

658
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:05,289
I know a <i>lawyer</i>, Jeffrey Stewart.

659
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:08,900
Just been appointed Special Investigator
to inquire into the rackets.

660
00:50:09,144 --> 00:50:12,549
That's him. He got the political bug.
Wants to be senator or something. Well.

661
00:50:13,154 --> 00:50:15,100
What does he do?
He turns the heat on Cookie.

662
00:50:15,663 --> 00:50:18,422
He calls him before the Grand Jury
in Springfield and if they get a ..

663
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:21,225
A, what do you call it, an indictment ..

664
00:50:22,098 --> 00:50:23,778
It means Cookie must stand trial, right?

665
00:50:23,864 --> 00:50:24,920
That means I go next.

666
00:50:25,643 --> 00:50:26,261
Well.

667
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:29,128
In a way, while you're talking up for
Cookie, you'll be talking for me, too.

668
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:30,451
Right?

669
00:50:31,223 --> 00:50:32,721
What do you say? What's his chances?

670
00:50:32,993 --> 00:50:34,006
You want it quick?

671
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:37,842
Get out of town, Cookie.

672
00:50:38,312 --> 00:50:40,466
If possible, get out of the state.
You haven't got a prayer.

673
00:50:41,298 --> 00:50:42,041
No?

674
00:50:43,196 --> 00:50:43,858
Why?

675
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:45,975
Too many witnesses against you.

676
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:47,755
Witnesses?

677
00:50:48,803 --> 00:50:49,758
For instance?

678
00:50:50,222 --> 00:50:52,491
Well to name a few:
Manny Nicholls, for instance.

679
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:54,275
Saul Horseman, for instance.

680
00:50:54,657 --> 00:50:57,938
Frank Deleary, Lippy Burke. There
is quite a list. I can't remember all.

681
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:09,794
Witnesses?

682
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:12,020
Those guys are dead.

683
00:51:12,879 --> 00:51:14,101
That's what I mean, Cookie.

684
00:51:14,637 --> 00:51:17,103
Any investigator in his right
mind knows who buried them.

685
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,265
You know something, Rico.

686
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,039
I don't like your genius.

687
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:36,620
He has a sense of humor.

688
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:39,246
But I don't like him.

689
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,203
Cookie, you go on.

690
00:51:43,472 --> 00:51:44,734
Let me talk to Tommy alone.

691
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,583
You weren't very polite to Cookie.
You hurt his feelings.

692
00:51:59,154 --> 00:52:00,773
I didn't realize he was so sensitive.

693
00:52:01,462 --> 00:52:02,957
A nice partner you're hooked up with.

694
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:04,856
He's a smart kid.

695
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:07,427
Brilliant. He's also a psychopath.

696
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:11,173
You know, that's what I like about
you, Tommy. You've got class.

697
00:52:12,677 --> 00:52:14,476
Big talk .. fancy words.

698
00:52:15,077 --> 00:52:16,169
But what's it mean?

699
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,235
He's insane, Rico. Crazy.
Gone in the head.

700
00:52:19,466 --> 00:52:20,146
Why?

701
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:24,011
Because he got rid of a few rats who got
in his way? Maybe I'd do the same thing.

702
00:52:24,278 --> 00:52:26,928
Am I crazy, too?
─ You're predictable, Rico. He isn't.

703
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,882
He doesn't kill for business.
He kills because he enjoys it.

704
00:52:30,052 --> 00:52:32,503
He's like .. a dog with rabies.

705
00:52:32,668 --> 00:52:35,318
Except he doesn't froth at the mouth.
Someday he'll get around to that, too.

706
00:52:35,883 --> 00:52:39,114
Look, maybe he froths, maybe he don't
froth. All I know is, he's in trouble.

707
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:41,444
And so am I .. so get to work, will you.

708
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:43,920
Sorry, Rico.

709
00:52:45,556 --> 00:52:46,941
That's what I want to talk about.

710
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:49,790
I'm going to the coast
in a couple of days.

711
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:52,367
Get a license out there and set
up a new practice. Legitimate.

712
00:52:53,152 --> 00:52:55,726
It will be tough for a while
but I figure I can make it.

713
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:00,410
I don't think I like this, Tommy.

714
00:53:02,005 --> 00:53:05,207
All of a sudden you walk on two feet,
and you kick your friends in the face.

715
00:53:05,624 --> 00:53:06,763
I don't see it that way.

716
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:09,509
You know everything about me,
Tommy. My whole operation.

717
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:13,928
Where the payoff is, and who to. All my
friends, all my enemies, alive and dead.

718
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:19,317
I always told you everything,
Tommy .. like a Priest, you know.

719
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,834
The only difference is,
a Priest can't talk.

720
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,922
You know me better than that.

721
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,506
Alright. Yeah.

722
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:31,528
I'm talking like a louse.

723
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:35,075
Well.

724
00:53:36,495 --> 00:53:38,437
Let's put it this way. I <i>need</i> you Tommy.

725
00:53:40,474 --> 00:53:42,177
You are my boy, like a son.

726
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:45,055
You walk out on me now,
what happens to poor Rico?

727
00:53:45,757 --> 00:53:48,981
Poor Rico gets himself another
lawyer. There are plenty in town.

728
00:53:49,301 --> 00:53:50,602
But only one Tommy Farrell.

729
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:52,956
Not available, Rico.

730
00:53:56,134 --> 00:53:58,779
You know there is one thing I could
never stand, it was a reformed drunk.

731
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,400
A reformed crook I would
put in the same class.

732
00:54:01,776 --> 00:54:04,259
A lawyer doesn't become a crook
just because he represents one.

733
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:06,443
I can plead any crooks case, even yours.

734
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,114
Or Cookie La Motte.

735
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:11,837
I'm out, Rico .. for good.

736
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:15,327
Nobody ever quit me.

737
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:17,844
I got rid of a few guys
but nobody ever quit.

738
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:19,371
Except me.

739
00:54:20,477 --> 00:54:21,552
Get used to it, Rico.

740
00:54:27,796 --> 00:54:29,263
I hate to do this.

741
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,294
You're making me sound like a lousy guy.

742
00:54:37,546 --> 00:54:40,821
Tommy, you know what you told
me about this new hip of yours?

743
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,681
How it's strung together
with pins and wires.

744
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:47,841
Plates and screws.

745
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:51,882
Suppose somebody took
a crowbar to that hip.

746
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:54,152
Huh?

747
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,965
One fast swing ..

748
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:02,341
It would look like the inside
of a busted radio set.

749
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:04,801
You wouldn't walk so good.

750
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:08,129
Maybe never. It hurts
me to think about it.

751
00:55:09,285 --> 00:55:10,156
Try it, Rico.

752
00:55:10,762 --> 00:55:11,841
Me? Nah ..

753
00:55:12,715 --> 00:55:13,736
You're my boy.

754
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:16,173
I couldn't do a thing like that.

755
00:55:18,709 --> 00:55:20,402
But I know a guy who would.

756
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,258
Have him try it.

757
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:26,904
And take that chick of yours.

758
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:31,922
That's what I call a real, pretty chick.
I only saw her once, but ..

759
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:34,896
The face of an angel.

760
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,624
You know what a bottle of acid
could do to a face like that?

761
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:42,882
There is a guy for that job, too.

762
00:55:44,345 --> 00:55:45,291
If you touch her.

763
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,744
If anyone touches her.
I'll kill you, Rico.

764
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:54,104
You don't have to kill me, Tommy.

765
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,870
Because nobody is going
to lay a finger on her.

766
00:55:58,941 --> 00:56:01,567
Because you are going to
take this Springfield job.

767
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:07,903
Now.

768
00:56:10,873 --> 00:56:12,475
Let's go and be polite to Cookie.

769
00:56:15,236 --> 00:56:16,275
Bring him in here.

770
00:56:16,628 --> 00:56:18,367
I don't chase around after punks.

771
00:56:20,729 --> 00:56:21,809
Temperamental.

772
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:24,172
Temperamental.

773
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:26,527
I like it.

774
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:55,363
Look.

775
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,451
It's the last job I'll do for Rico.
He understands that.

776
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:01,147
When this thing is over,
the day it's over ..

777
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:04,236
Tommy .. don't try to explain it to me.

778
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:06,228
You've taken this case.

779
00:57:06,872 --> 00:57:08,368
For some reason you want me with you.

780
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,921
Well .. I'm here.

781
00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:11,934
[ Buzzer ]

782
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:12,873
Yeah?

783
00:57:14,108 --> 00:57:14,944
Hello.

784
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:20,124
I was just passing. And I thought I'd
stop in and say hello to my counselor.

785
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,094
How is it going?

786
00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:26,471
I wondered, when we get there tomorrow.

787
00:57:26,558 --> 00:57:28,919
I thought perhaps you might
want to rehearse me a little bit.

788
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:30,453
Tell me what to say.

789
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,892
What you need to rehearse
Cookie is keeping your mouth shut.

790
00:57:32,978 --> 00:57:34,824
And get yourself a
decent suit of clothes.

791
00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:38,150
Just trying to be of some help.
─ Sure.

792
00:57:38,654 --> 00:57:39,490
Can you read?

793
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:42,956
Run over this stuff and see
how they can fail to indict you.

794
00:57:43,923 --> 00:57:46,762
They'll indict, and that
means a jury trial.

795
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,181
Now, you're a genius in front of a jury.
─ So is Jeffrey Stewart.

796
00:57:50,445 --> 00:57:51,364
I'm not worried.

797
00:57:51,997 --> 00:57:53,471
Rico says I'm in good hands.

798
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:54,872
The best.

799
00:57:56,233 --> 00:57:56,921
Right?

800
00:57:57,794 --> 00:57:58,896
It had better be.

801
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:22,975
Mr Field.
─ Yes, sir.

802
00:58:23,202 --> 00:58:24,502
As a prospective juror.

803
00:58:24,898 --> 00:58:26,996
Do you have any moral aversion
towards capital punishment?

804
00:58:27,258 --> 00:58:27,931
No sir.

805
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:31,169
Could you send the defendant,
Cookie La Motte, to the electric chair?

806
00:58:32,228 --> 00:58:33,387
If he deserved it, yeah.

807

The state finds this juryman acceptable.

808
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:38,776
Thank you.
─ You're welcome.

809
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:42,454
All yours, Mr Farrell.
─ Thank you.

810
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:48,856
Mr Field.
─ Yes, sir.

811
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:51,908
Have you formed any kind
of notions about this case?

812
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:54,303
Whether the defendant
might be guilty or innocent?

813
00:58:54,925 --> 00:58:55,597
No sir.

814
00:58:56,445 --> 00:58:58,132
Do you know anything
about Cookie La Motte?

815
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,795
No .. no.

816
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:01,968
Do you read the newspapers?

817
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:03,380
Yes, sporting pages.

818
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:06,181
That's all you read?
─ And the comics.

819
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,372
Something fishy about this one.
I can't put my finger on it.

820
00:59:18,801 --> 00:59:19,473
Accept.

I don't like him.

822

He's okay.

Accept.

May we have a decision, Mr Farrell?

826
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:34,242
Is this juryman acceptable or not?

827
00:59:39,934 --> 00:59:41,446
Acceptable, Your Honor.
─ Next.

828
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:55,872

829

Juror bribed.

Put them in there. In this cab.

Says they'll get rid of Jeffrey Stewart.

834

Get rid of him, how?

835

Take a guess. You know
what this can mean to me?

836
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,125
It could be a lot of trouble, boy.
Go see him. Talk some sense into him.

837
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:38,462
I warned you about that punk.

838
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:41,465
Some day he'd froth at the mouth.
Didn't take long, did it?

839
01:00:42,437 --> 01:00:45,168
Don't ask me to wipe his face.
He's your baby now, Rico.

Clean up the mess yourself.

Get rid of Stewart how, Cookie?

01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:19,891
We vote him out.
My friends and I vote him out.

I've some very accommodating friends.

Listen gay boy, you don't run around
knocking off State's Attorneys.

It isn't being done this year.

850

If Stewart gets a scratch, they'll
run you down like a sewer rat.

851
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:30,048
Why me? Stewart's in Chicago.
I'm not in the state.

852
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:31,953
Your accommodating
friends are. Good enough.

Theirs or mine? You talk like theirs.

If you're such a genius, what am I
doing sitting in this trap right now?

Look, I can do something about lawyers.
What are you going to do about it?

856
01:01:40,098 --> 01:01:43,143
Talk! Do something whatever,
or shut up and let me do it myself.

857
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:45,127
I ought to warn you.

Rico knows what you've got
in mind. He doesn't like it.

Well, that's lovely. You can
tell Rico from me he can go ..

Sometime this morning.

Farrell was in Whiting
last night. They know that.

If you pay his bond now, you might as
well tell the Police you sent him there.

The defendant Gaye is being held
on an open charge. Is that correct?

That is correct, Your Honor.

935
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:27,676
Your Honor, since there
is no definite charge.

from the Prosecutor's office.

We recommend sufficient bail
to assure his presence at trial.

945
01:06:55,593 --> 01:06:58,673
Bail for the defendant Gaye is
set at five thousand dollars.

Or are you thinking of making
this your permanent address?

953
01:07:32,092 --> 01:07:34,128
The food is inexpensive
and the bed's not bad.

954
01:07:34,529 --> 01:07:35,586
I might just do that.

955
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:39,106
Besides, I have to come to trial
sometime. You can't hold me for ever.

Once again, who killed Cookie La Motte?

961
01:07:56,844 --> 01:07:58,385
Person or persons unknown.

962
01:07:59,316 --> 01:08:02,184
Once again, who bribed that
juror down at Springfield?

963
01:08:02,505 --> 01:08:03,652
Not me. You know that.

964
01:08:04,068 --> 01:08:05,914
Sure, I know that. You're too smart.

965
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:07,884
But will a jury think so?

966
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:09,507
I doubt it.

967
01:08:11,017 --> 01:08:12,943
When I was a practicing attorney.

968
01:08:13,502 --> 01:08:14,585
A couple of weeks ago.

969
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,138
My great stock in trade
was defending the guilty.

970
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:20,343
Evidently, yours is
convicting the innocent.

971
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,053
Tom.

972
01:08:23,323 --> 01:08:25,300
You are my whole case
against Rico Angelo.

973
01:08:26,474 --> 01:08:27,255
I need you.

974
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,194
So you're threatening me.
─ You bet I am.

975
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:31,811
I warned you. I can be
just as conniving as you.

976
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,180
Maybe more so.

977
01:08:33,492 --> 01:08:36,147
But there is one difference between us.
I happen to be on the right side.

978
01:08:36,517 --> 01:08:37,843
And I have no rights at all.

979
01:08:38,652 --> 01:08:39,538
Except one.

980
01:08:39,892 --> 01:08:41,507
The right to be left alone. Do you mind?

981
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:43,637
I'd like to read my newspaper.

982
01:08:49,443 --> 01:08:51,219
What you need Tom, is a smart lawyer.

983
01:08:51,653 --> 01:08:53,181
Maybe so. Want the job?

984
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,728
I wouldn't be bad at it.

985
01:08:57,249 --> 01:09:00,678
I might even dream up something
as good as that .. watch gag of yours.

986
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:03,823
I always admired that piece of business.

987
01:09:05,032 --> 01:09:07,541
Tell me Tom, where'd you get the watch?
Not from your father?

988
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,447
I buy them by the gross.

989
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:11,797
You plead my case for
me I'll give you one.

990
01:09:11,998 --> 01:09:13,850
If I were pleading your
case, I wouldn't need it.

991
01:09:14,503 --> 01:09:18,388
All I'd want from you is a statement to
go states evidence against Rico Angelo.

992
01:09:18,971 --> 01:09:21,234
Ten minutes after you signed it,
you'd be walking out that door.

993
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:23,675
I'll think over your advice.
Mail me your bill.

994
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:26,759
Excuse me, Mr Stewart.
He's got a visitor.

995
01:09:29,891 --> 01:09:33,042
After two weeks. I thought
you might like a little company.

996
01:09:37,212 --> 01:09:38,040
Go ahead.

997
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:39,575
Thanks.

998
01:09:47,264 --> 01:09:48,485
She's a nice girl, Farrell.

999
01:09:59,347 --> 01:10:00,459
I tried to come before.

1000
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:01,957
They wouldn't let me.

1001
01:10:03,339 --> 01:10:04,280
Are you alright?

1002
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,615
How about you?
─ Fine.

1003
01:10:08,169 --> 01:10:09,005
I have a job.

1004
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,599
At the Golden Rooster.

1005
01:10:11,111 --> 01:10:12,502
More money than before.

1006
01:10:13,344 --> 01:10:14,537
Pretty funny, isn't it.

1007
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,406
Did they tell you who paid your bail?

1008
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:19,571
Just the club. That's all.

1009
01:10:20,736 --> 01:10:21,390
Why?

1010
01:10:22,287 --> 01:10:23,649
No reason. I just asked.

1011
01:10:24,318 --> 01:10:24,962
Tommy.

1012
01:10:25,904 --> 01:10:27,563
Why hasn't someone
done something for you?

1013
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:30,660
They could get you out .. Angelo could.

1014
01:10:31,658 --> 01:10:34,160
Right now, Angelo would like to
pretend I don't exist. I'm a criminal.

1015
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:36,895
He can't afford to get mixed
up with the criminal types.

1016
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,353
Maybe if I went.

1017
01:10:39,923 --> 01:10:42,048
If I told ..
─ No! Stay away from him.

1018
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,388
Don't ever go anywhere near Rico Angelo.

1019
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:51,225
I was going to write to you.

1020
01:10:53,024 --> 01:10:54,465
Now it doesn't seem very important.

1021
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,278
My wife is divorcing me.

1022
01:10:59,737 --> 01:11:00,876
A little late, isn't it.

1023
01:11:02,853 --> 01:11:03,809
Not for me.

1024
01:11:06,139 --> 01:11:07,557
Alright, Mr Farrell. Let's go.

1025
01:11:22,677 --> 01:11:23,613
Oh, Miss Gaye.

1026
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,125
I .. just wanted you to know.

1027
01:11:26,876 --> 01:11:28,645
You can have a pass now,
any time you want it.

1028
01:11:29,602 --> 01:11:30,357
Thank you.

1029
01:11:30,514 --> 01:11:32,514
We're sorry to have to
hold him here like this.

1030
01:11:32,885 --> 01:11:35,595
Actually, it's not Farrell we
want at all. It's Rico Angelo.

1031
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:40,355
If you could just get Farrell to talk.
To supply us with certain information.

1032
01:11:40,657 --> 01:11:42,235
We'd do everything we could to help him.

1033
01:11:42,935 --> 01:11:44,046
You mean, he'd go free?

1034
01:11:44,472 --> 01:11:45,367
That's right.

1035
01:11:45,847 --> 01:11:47,653
Have you told him that?
─ Every day.

1036
01:11:48,792 --> 01:11:49,822
What was his answer?

1037
01:11:50,421 --> 01:11:51,121
Nothing.

1038
01:11:51,855 --> 01:11:53,063
Then why tell me about it?

1039
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,106
Because we think he'd listen to you.

1040
01:11:57,757 --> 01:11:59,600
He could go to prison for twenty years.

1041
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:01,415
You know that.

1042
01:12:02,732 --> 01:12:03,618
Yes.

1043
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:13,257
[ Door knocks ]

1044
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:14,728
Just a minute.

1045
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,529
What are you doing here?

1046
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:28,589
I just wanted to wish
you a happy new year.

1047
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:30,376
Happy new year. Get out.

1048
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:32,685
I said get out!

1049
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:34,707
I got a message for you.

1050
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:37,428
From Rico Angelo.

1051
01:15:38,262 --> 01:15:41,763
He says tell Tommy he's doing a good job.
Playing smart. He wants him to know that.

1052
01:15:42,155 --> 01:15:43,036
You're a liar.

1053
01:15:43,656 --> 01:15:45,105
Rico Angelo didn't say anything.

1054
01:15:46,244 --> 01:15:47,081
That's right.

1055
01:15:48,142 --> 01:15:49,482
I'm just making conversation.

1056
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,843
All the same, Tommy is
doing okay, not talking.

1057
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:55,106
I mean.

1058
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:57,856
You know.

1059
01:15:58,163 --> 01:15:59,376
His friends appreciate it.

1060
01:15:59,951 --> 01:16:01,138
I hope he does talk.

1061
01:16:01,843 --> 01:16:05,448
I hope he digs a black hole for all his
very good friends and shoves them in it.

1062
01:16:06,101 --> 01:16:07,103
You included.

1063
01:16:07,747 --> 01:16:09,356
You ought to be nicer to me, Puss.

1064
01:16:09,836 --> 01:16:12,149
You might need me sometime.
I could be a big help.

1065
01:16:12,857 --> 01:16:14,056
Why would I ever need you?

1066
01:16:15,219 --> 01:16:16,082
You know.

1067
01:16:16,975 --> 01:16:19,457
In case they put the screws
on Tommy and he sings a little.

1068
01:16:20,298 --> 01:16:21,683
Be a good time to have me around.

1069
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:25,629
I ain't afraid of Rico Angelo.
A lot of guys are, but not me.

1070
01:16:26,766 --> 01:16:27,767
Maybe you're right.

1071
01:16:28,597 --> 01:16:29,786
Maybe I do need someone.

1072
01:16:31,043 --> 01:16:32,465
You ain't got far to look.

1073
01:16:33,962 --> 01:16:36,039
I always had a kind of thing for you.

1074
01:16:37,475 --> 01:16:39,189
You know what I mean?
─ Louis.

1075
01:16:40,074 --> 01:16:41,049
Tell me something.

1076
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:43,331
How bad a spot am I in?

1077
01:16:44,449 --> 01:16:46,430
Don't worry about it.
─ Yes, but ..

1078
01:16:46,717 --> 01:16:48,206
Like you said, if Tommy <i>did</i> talk ..

1079
01:16:49,628 --> 01:16:50,910
What would Rico do to me?

1080
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:52,766
I don't know.

1081
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,393
Maybe nothing.

1082
01:16:55,936 --> 01:16:57,322
He'd try to kill me, wouldn't he.

1083
01:16:58,027 --> 01:16:59,251
Well, not if I'm here.

1084
01:16:59,858 --> 01:17:01,830
Not if I'm here.
─ Thank you, Louis.

1085
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,690
Hey come on. What are you,
crazy or something?

1086
01:17:07,057 --> 01:17:08,279
What's the matter with you?

1087
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:25,012
Hello?
─ "Mr Stewart?"

1088
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,054
Yes.

1089
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:28,774
I want to see Tommy.

1090
01:17:29,724 --> 01:17:31,025
You've got to let me see him.

1091
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,084
You had a visitor's pass
whenever you wanted it.

1092
01:17:34,653 --> 01:17:37,274
I don't mean there.
I can't talk to him there.

1093
01:17:38,109 --> 01:17:39,751
I want to see him alone by ourselves.

1094
01:17:41,338 --> 01:17:42,879
Do you think you can get him to talk?

1095
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,336
I don't know.

1096
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,417
I'll do what I can.

1097
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,745
But I've got to be alone with him.
Just for a little while.

1098
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,302
Please.

1099
01:17:52,546 --> 01:17:53,278
Help me.

1100
01:18:12,466 --> 01:18:13,579
See you later, Farrell.

1101
01:18:25,282 --> 01:18:26,777
The phone will ring in a few minutes.

1102
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:28,421
Three times.

1103
01:18:29,392 --> 01:18:30,752
It means I have to leave.

1104
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:33,487
They won't let me come back again.

1105
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:37,042
For the last time, will you
talk to Jeffrey Stewart?

1106
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:41,312
You're afraid, aren't you.

1107
01:18:41,589 --> 01:18:42,906
Not for yourself. For me.

1108
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:45,225
Afraid of what they'll do to me.

1109
01:18:47,148 --> 01:18:48,123
Who told you that?

1110
01:18:48,778 --> 01:18:51,104
I'm not afraid .. why should you be?

1111
01:18:51,529 --> 01:18:53,217
When we're not together,
we have nothing.

1112
01:18:53,303 --> 01:18:54,821
We're alive. That's something.

1113
01:18:55,165 --> 01:18:57,160
As long as I keep my mouth
shut, you'll be alright.

1114
01:18:57,633 --> 01:18:58,695
Do you think so?

1115
01:18:59,337 --> 01:19:00,585
Do you really think so?

1116
01:19:01,632 --> 01:19:02,901
Let me tell you something.

1117
01:19:03,649 --> 01:19:05,584
I had a visitor last night
in my dressing-room.

1118
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:08,243
Your good friend, Louis Canetto.

1119
01:19:09,705 --> 01:19:11,063
He came in while I was changing.

1120
01:19:11,809 --> 01:19:12,742
He didn't ask.

1121
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:14,375
He just walked in.

1122
01:19:15,728 --> 01:19:17,016
He's the one who told me.

1123
01:19:18,444 --> 01:19:19,759
And then he came close to me.

1124
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:22,501
As close as I am to you.

1125
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:25,051
And then he put his hands on me.

1126
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:27,285
Tell me it's alright, Tommy!

1127
01:19:30,185 --> 01:19:32,075
I'm sorry for what I've done to you.

1128
01:19:33,459 --> 01:19:35,132
[ Telephone ]

1129
01:19:36,267 --> 01:19:38,174
[ Telephone ]

1130
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:40,682
[ Telephone ]

1131
01:19:46,246 --> 01:19:48,085
It's no use. He's protecting me.

1132
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:50,787
See that she gets home.
─ Right.

1133
01:19:54,276 --> 01:19:55,516
Bring Farrell to my office.

1134
01:20:09,897 --> 01:20:12,627
You know we had to pay a month's
rent in advance for that place today.

1135
01:20:14,904 --> 01:20:17,025
Looks as though we wasted
the taxpayer’s dough.

1136
01:20:18,759 --> 01:20:20,570
You could have been a
big help to us, Farrell.

1137
01:20:21,698 --> 01:20:23,001
We really could have used you.

1138
01:20:25,301 --> 01:20:27,427
But since obviously you're
not going to play along.

1139
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:29,599
There's nothing much
we can do, is there.

1140
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:40,553
I think this is everything
you came in with.

1141
01:20:41,089 --> 01:20:42,941
You'll have to sign for
it downstairs of course.

1142
01:20:43,574 --> 01:20:44,904
Would you like to explain this?

1143
01:20:46,215 --> 01:20:47,468
There's nothing to explain.

1144
01:20:48,092 --> 01:20:49,566
We're letting you go. That's all.

1145
01:20:50,249 --> 01:20:52,046
You're out.
─ What did you tell the newspapers?

1146
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:54,590
That I talked? That I
turned state's evidence?

1147
01:20:56,192 --> 01:20:57,385
I don't tell them a thing.

1148
01:20:57,634 --> 01:20:59,248
I let them draw their own conclusions.

1149
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:01,591
They will, too. Everyone will.

1150
01:21:02,739 --> 01:21:05,338
Including Rico Angelo.
He'll think I made a deal with you.

1151
01:21:07,406 --> 01:21:08,928
You know what you're doing, of course.

1152
01:21:10,187 --> 01:21:13,171
The second I set a foot out the building
you can put a call in for the coroner.

1153
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:14,905
That's your problem.

1154
01:21:19,131 --> 01:21:20,196
What about the girl?

1155
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:21,631
That's your problem, too.

1156
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:23,913
You've made it for
yourselves, both of you.

1157
01:21:29,366 --> 01:21:30,530
I want protection.

1158
01:21:31,576 --> 01:21:32,648
Not myself. For her.

1159
01:21:33,987 --> 01:21:34,855
Good enough.

1160
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:36,577
We'll send her to the coast.

1161
01:21:37,217 --> 01:21:38,672
Hold her there as long as you want.

1162
01:21:53,266 --> 01:21:54,105
Alright.

1163
01:21:54,864 --> 01:21:55,865
Get a stenographer.

1164
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:00,897
There will be someone
meeting you in Los Angeles.

1165
01:22:01,529 --> 01:22:03,603
You won't have to look
for him. He'll know you.

1166
01:22:04,177 --> 01:22:07,154
And .. don't leave the compartment
until he picks you up.

1167
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:53,881
Swear out a warrant for Rico Angelo and
anyone else named in the transcript.

1168
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:55,316
Is that all?

1169
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,006
You can go now.

1170
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,694
If you want.

1171
01:22:59,615 --> 01:23:01,458
Or, we can hold you here a while longer.

1172
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,008
It might be safer.

1173
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:08,064
Now there is not a safe place anywhere
above ground. I think we both know that.

1174
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,175
Wait a minute.

1175
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:14,100
You want this?

1176
01:23:14,972 --> 01:23:15,688
Thanks.

1177
01:23:16,428 --> 01:23:17,511
I don't have a permit.

1178
01:23:22,272 --> 01:23:25,863
Incidentally, if you should have
any trouble locating Mr Angelo.

1179
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:28,320
He won't be far behind me.

1180
01:23:32,464 --> 01:23:33,704
Do what you can for him.

1181
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:40,518
Mr Farrell.

1182
01:23:44,543 --> 01:23:45,343
Hi Nick.

1183
01:23:46,347 --> 01:23:47,623
Let me have a beer, will you.

1184
01:23:50,267 --> 01:23:51,541
Good to see you, Mr Farrell.

1185
01:23:52,376 --> 01:23:53,625
Anybody been in today?

1186
01:23:54,394 --> 01:23:56,075
No, it's a little early yet, Mr Farrell.

1187
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:03,796
If anyone comes in,
tell them I was here.

1188
01:24:04,135 --> 01:24:05,223
I'll be back later.

1189
01:24:31,325 --> 01:24:33,632
It's like he's looking to get
knocked off, Mr Stewart.

1190
01:24:33,942 --> 01:24:35,427
He's done everything but advertize.

1191
01:24:38,841 --> 01:24:39,459
Yeah.

1192
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,053
I can't figure whether Angelo is looking
for him or he's looking for Angelo.

1193
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:03,426
I'll finish that beer now, Nick.
─ Sure, Mr Farrell.

1194
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:07,294
Alright, Nick.
─ Good to see you.

1195
01:25:07,957 --> 01:25:09,240
[ Telephone ]

1196
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:12,352
Hello?

1197
01:25:13,387 --> 01:25:14,470
Yeah, he just come in.

1198
01:25:15,639 --> 01:25:16,669
For you, Mr Farrell.

1199
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,328
Hello?
─ "Farrell - Rico wants to see you."

1200
01:25:25,241 --> 01:25:26,430
Yeah, I thought he might.

1201
01:25:27,299 --> 01:25:28,108
Where is he?

1202
01:25:28,262 --> 01:25:30,307
Don't ask questions and
don't make any moves.

1203
01:25:32,952 --> 01:25:34,013
Is Rico there now?

1204
01:25:35,343 --> 01:25:36,124
Put him on.

1205
01:25:36,338 --> 01:25:37,530
"Never mind, is here now."

1206
01:25:38,381 --> 01:25:39,955
Just walk out the back door.

1207
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:41,980
"Farrell."

1208
01:25:42,896 --> 01:25:44,088
"Do you hear what I said?"

1209
01:25:44,915 --> 01:25:46,526
"Walk out the back door."

1210
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:44,877
Everybody out.

1211
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:46,293
Louis.

1212
01:26:47,117 --> 01:26:47,925
Stay here.

1213
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,332
You too.

1214
01:26:49,957 --> 01:26:52,146
Rico, I'm telling you, you can't ..
─ Keep your mouth shut.

1215
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,310
You weren't hard to find, boy.

1216
01:26:55,705 --> 01:26:57,389
I didn't want to put you to any tröuble.

1217
01:26:57,631 --> 01:26:59,794
I figured you'd catch up with
me sooner or later anyway.

1218
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:03,155
A couple of times today we could
have cooled you real good.

1219
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:06,090
I wasn't worried.
I know you too well, Rico.

1220
01:27:06,901 --> 01:27:08,773
Some things you like
to handle personally.

1221
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,227
You and Stewart had
quite a conversation.

1222
01:27:19,315 --> 01:27:20,767
How far did you go, boy?

1223
01:27:21,146 --> 01:27:22,633
All the way. Everything.

1224
01:27:24,421 --> 01:27:25,133
Why?

1225
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:29,841
I'm asking you.

1226
01:27:31,132 --> 01:27:33,427
Why do you do a thing like this to Rico?

1227
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:35,320
I'm a peculiar guy.

1228
01:27:35,616 --> 01:27:38,165
I don't like jails for anyone.
Especially me.

1229
01:27:38,413 --> 01:27:39,556
We'd have got you out.

1230
01:27:40,371 --> 01:27:42,364
We were working on getting you out.
─ How?

1231
01:27:42,879 --> 01:27:43,950
In a basket?

1232
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:50,730
Here's what I want you to do.

1233
01:27:52,723 --> 01:27:54,977
I want you to go back to
that Stewart character.

1234
01:27:55,134 --> 01:27:57,100
And tell him you made a slight mistake.

1235
01:27:59,251 --> 01:28:01,993
You were anxious to
spring yourself, huh?

1236
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:05,676
So all that talk you
gave him was .. just that.

1237
01:28:06,367 --> 01:28:07,151
Talk.

1238
01:28:07,793 --> 01:28:09,841
Rico, you're living in a dream world.

1239
01:28:10,265 --> 01:28:11,177
It's too late.

1240
01:28:14,269 --> 01:28:15,239
Maybe not.

1241
01:28:15,775 --> 01:28:17,251
Ask your lawyer. Tell him, Lou.

1242
01:28:19,149 --> 01:28:20,677
Whatever Rico says.

1243
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,959
I think you'll do it.

1244
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:55,518
Yeah .. I think you will.

1245
01:28:56,654 --> 01:28:58,142
From Rico to Tommy, huh?

1246
01:28:59,121 --> 01:28:59,928
Oh no.

1247
01:29:00,545 --> 01:29:01,610
Not for you.

1248
01:29:03,086 --> 01:29:04,368
As for you, boy.

1249
01:29:08,272 --> 01:29:09,164
Bring her here.

1250
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:17,910
Take it off.

1251
01:29:37,782 --> 01:29:38,626
Sick, eh?

1252
01:29:39,799 --> 01:29:40,820
Sick in the belly.

1253
01:29:41,346 --> 01:29:43,536
It could have been, you know.
It can still be.

1254
01:29:55,743 --> 01:29:56,822
Like I say.

1255
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:00,116
The face of an angel.

1256
01:30:03,475 --> 01:30:06,140
You can't do this, Rico.
─ Make me try.

1257
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:13,193
Lou Forbes thinks maybe I can.

1258
01:30:13,519 --> 01:30:14,898
He doesn't know you like I do.

1259
01:30:15,218 --> 01:30:16,054
Listen, Rico.

1260
01:30:16,146 --> 01:30:19,183
Think back a long time, right in this
neighborhood, a few blocks from here.

1261
01:30:19,734 --> 01:30:21,464
You didn't know me then, but I knew you.

1262
01:30:21,765 --> 01:30:22,611
Everyone did.

1263
01:30:23,058 --> 01:30:25,410
"Rico Angelo". King of the kids.

1264
01:30:26,182 --> 01:30:29,167
We used to look up to your, Rico. You
were a big guy. And how did you make it?

1265
01:30:29,656 --> 01:30:31,664
By beating up on the
weak and the helpless?

1266
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:33,133
Not Rico.

1267
01:30:33,374 --> 01:30:35,916
Rico went looking for the biggest
and toughest he could find.

1268
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:39,004
And he cut them down to size with his
own two hands. That was Rico's way.

1269
01:30:40,031 --> 01:30:42,745
And it's still your way, Rico.
A man can't change that much.

1270
01:30:42,908 --> 01:30:44,483
That's why you won't do this.

1271
01:30:45,089 --> 01:30:47,596
I remember once, one of the kids.
One of the weak ones.

1272
01:30:47,895 --> 01:30:50,064
His old man gave him
a watch for graduation.

1273
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,606
His old man was a drunk and a bum,
but he gave the kid a watch.

1274
01:30:53,884 --> 01:30:58,043
He was proud. He went showing it to the
gang: "Look my old man gave me a watch."

1275
01:30:58,476 --> 01:31:01,173
Next thing you know, some mug
took it away from him. A big guy.

1276
01:31:01,557 --> 01:31:03,636
Took it away. Kicked the kid.
Knocked him down.

1277
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,157
Then Rico came along.

1278
01:31:06,984 --> 01:31:08,644
He worked that big guy over and good.

1279
01:31:08,812 --> 01:31:11,103
And when he was finished he handed
the kid his watch and he said:

1280
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:13,062
"Go on home."

1281
01:31:13,504 --> 01:31:15,820
"On this block, no kid gets hurt."

1282
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,095
You don't remember that, do you Rico.

1283
01:31:19,317 --> 01:31:20,191
Well, I do.

1284
01:31:20,733 --> 01:31:21,701
I was the kid.

1285
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:22,587
Stop.

1286
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:25,118
You've come a long way
from those days, Rico.

1287
01:31:25,204 --> 01:31:29,023
You got yourself out the gutter, out of
the filth and muck and stood at the top.

1288
01:31:29,186 --> 01:31:30,971
It wasn't luck. It wasn't an accident.

1289
01:31:31,798 --> 01:31:33,095
It took a big man.

1290
01:31:33,796 --> 01:31:34,531
This.

1291
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:37,271
This is not the act of a <i>big</i> man.

1292
01:31:38,088 --> 01:31:41,395
This I'd expect from some of the lice
who feed from you, but not from Rico.

1293
01:31:41,615 --> 01:31:43,377
It's beneath the Rico I once knew.

1294
01:31:44,424 --> 01:31:46,896
Rico Angelo. King of the kids.

1295
01:31:48,596 --> 01:31:49,988
And you know something, Rico?

1296
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:53,208
In your own peculiar
way you're still the King.

1297
01:31:53,295 --> 01:31:54,629
You going to listen to this?

1298
01:31:54,715 --> 01:31:56,414
Shut up you two-bit, greasy punk.

1299
01:31:56,501 --> 01:31:59,011
Don't ever open your filthy mouth
when I'm speaking. You understand that?

1300
01:31:59,268 --> 01:32:00,325
Listen, Rico. He's ..

1301
01:32:00,997 --> 01:32:03,822
Why, don't ever raise your hands
to me or I'll blow your head off!

1302
01:32:03,998 --> 01:32:05,137
Lay off. Let him talk!

1303
01:32:14,139 --> 01:32:15,051
Go on.

1304
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,995
He's the kind of a punk you listen to.

1305
01:32:17,081 --> 01:32:19,043
That's why you're in a jam now.
Not on account of me.

1306
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,153
I may be in a jam, but I'll get out.

1307
01:32:21,937 --> 01:32:23,555
Rico, I'll make a deal with you.

1308
01:32:24,717 --> 01:32:27,037
Put her back on that train
and I'll make a deal.

1309
01:32:27,345 --> 01:32:29,225
What kind of a deal?
You going to see Stewart?

1310
01:32:29,464 --> 01:32:32,404
And land back in the can? I can't help
you from there. I've got to be out.

1311
01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:34,599
I'll defend you, Rico.

1312
01:32:35,412 --> 01:32:36,220
How?

1313
01:32:37,175 --> 01:32:38,751
He can't. They won't let him in court.

1314
01:32:38,838 --> 01:32:40,510
Not in court, you poor slob.

1315
01:32:41,142 --> 01:32:42,424
I'll prepare your case.

1316
01:32:42,511 --> 01:32:44,864
I'll tell that monkey every
word to say and how to say it.

1317
01:32:45,117 --> 01:32:47,371
I'll take my own testimony
and rip it to shreds.

1318
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:50,215
I can do it, Rico. You <i>know</i> I can do it.

1319
01:32:50,476 --> 01:32:51,522
Can he do it?

1320
01:32:52,475 --> 01:32:53,175
Tell me.

1321
01:32:54,947 --> 01:32:55,644
Rico.

1322
01:32:56,425 --> 01:32:57,888
[ Gunshots! ]

1323
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:33,220
Big talk, huh?

1324
01:33:34,443 --> 01:33:35,602
Fancy words.

1325
01:33:40,124 --> 01:33:41,783
You got class, Tommy.

1326
01:33:43,402 --> 01:33:44,942
That's why I like you ..

1327
01:33:47,589 --> 01:33:48,720
Ahh!

1328
01:34:17,992 --> 01:34:19,672
One of our boys found it upstairs.

1329
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:22,835
It had your initials on the back.

1330
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:25,208
Did it really work again?

1331
01:34:29,587 --> 01:34:31,540
Keep it .. as a souvenir.

1332
01:34:46,676 --> 01:34:50,953
T-G
