00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,082
<i>This isn't make-believe.</i>

2
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:14,122
- <i>It really happened.</i>
- <i>Come off it!</i>

3
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:18,958
<i>Okay, leave that.</i>
<i>Were going to record.</i>

4
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:22,437
<i>Recording!</i>

5
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:35,917
<i>Hey!</i>

6
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:37,999
<i>Guantanamera,</i>

<i>guajira guantanamera.</i>

10
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:53,602
<i>Oh, my divine country girl,</i>

11
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:57,443
<i>my girl from Guantánamo,</i>

12
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:02,118
<i>girl from Guantánamo,</i>

13
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:06,477
<i>country girl from Guantánamo.</i>

14
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:09,966
<i>Get wise, dummy,</i>

15
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:11,836
<i>hey, listen, stupid,</i>

16
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,445
<i>don't let what I say</i>
<i>freak you out.</i>

17
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,359
<i>It's the truth, brother.</i>

18
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:17,756
<i>Believe it!</i>

19
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,356
<i>Yoyita, the former singer</i>

20
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:32,996
<i>who was born in Guantánamo,</i>

21
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:36,756
<i>Yoyita, the former singer</i>

22
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:40,796
<i>who was born in Guantánamo,</i>

23
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,762
<i>returned to her hometown</i>

24
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:49,518
<i>for an elegant reception</i>
<i>in her honour.</i>

25
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,759
<i>Guantanamera,</i>

26
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:56,687
<i>guajira guantanamera,</i>

27
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,361
<i>guantanamera,</i>

28
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:05,364
<i>guajira guantanamera.</i>

29
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,043
<i>She went in search of a dream</i>

30
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,601
<i>from her distant past,</i>

31
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,647
<i>she went in search of a dream</i>

32
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,202
<i>from her distant past,</i>

33
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,924
<i>which brought turmoil</i>

34
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:28,958

35
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,326
<i>Guantanamera,</i>

36
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,956
<i>guajira guantanamera...</i>

37
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,557
Goodness!
What have they done?

38
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,603
- Isn't that the Lopez's house?
- Yes.

39
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:52,202
- Look at the state of it!
- You can imagine, auntie.

40
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:56,077
- What's become of them?
- They were among the first to go.

41
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:57,077
Really?

42
00:02:58,647 --> 00:02:59,523
Of course.

43
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,365
- What about your husband?
- Adolfo?

44
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:13,923
You know how he loves Havana.
He's at one of his meetings.

45
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,284
Please, friends, please.

46
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:24,315
We're making this issue more
complicated than it really is.

47
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,363
Justifiably so!

48
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:28,405
No. I've got to get back to
Camagüey as soon as possible.

49
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,239
This is a clear-cut issue.

50
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:33,524
If a man dies in Baracoa,
he should be buried there.

51
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:36,042
After all, it's one and
the same country.

52
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:37,397
Look here, Rivero,

53
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,046
if I die in Baracoa,

54
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,641
no way is anyone going to
force me to be buried there.

55
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:45,482
I'm from Santa Clara, and
all my family and friends

56
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:46,397
live there.

57
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:50,526
Take it easy, friends,
cool down.

58
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:52,325
Exuse me, Benito.

59
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,002
Look here, Rivero,
I agree with Paula.

60
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,801
It's not my fault if
I die in Baracoa.

61
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,676
- I might just be visiting friends.
- Who asked you, anyway?

62
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:03,363
Friends,

63
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,404
don't all speak at once!

64
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,636
Go ahead, Adolfo...

65
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:10,003
What if...

66
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,483
we share the body out

67
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,002
among all of us?

68
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:19,915
Be more specific.

69
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,442
If each provincial company
assumes responsibility

70
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:23,835
for its own territory,

71
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:28,606
if we each agree to transport
the body across our province,

72
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,918
then we all have less to do.

73
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:34,085
In which case no one
will exceed

74
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,966
the petrol allowance
granted to each undertaker.

75
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:38,836
Look, Justo,

76
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:42,204
if we carry out a careful,
on-the-spot study,

77
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,925
adhering to the proper procedures,

78
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:45,881
the plan has to work.

79
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:49,483
- I totally reject such a wild idea.
- Me too.

80
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:52,605
It's okay for you, because
you're from Guantánamo

81
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,076
and there are no other
towns in this direction.

82
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:57,841
But I'm from Santa Clara,

83
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:00,675
smack in the middle
of the island.

84
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:03,725
Every corpse on the island
will be stopping off there.

85
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:05,924
I'm no stepping stone,
Adolfo!

86
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,321
Friends,

87
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:09,956
it's no good just considering
our own problems.

88
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,766
We're losing the overall
view of the matter.

89
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,161
We have to think
patriotically.

90
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,960
This isn't a local tavern.

91
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,402
They may have given
Adolfo the boot

92
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:27,240
but he still seems
to be well-connected.

93
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:30,519
What's the alternative, auntie?
You have to survive somehow.

94
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:35,077
Are you still unoccupied, Gina?
You've not gone back to teaching?

95
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,760
Back to teaching?

96
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,606
With all the trouble I had
at the University?

97
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:44,123
Here theory and practice are two
different things. I'm not going

98
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:45,242
through all that again.

99
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:48,399
Yes, but there are otherjobs.

100
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:51,559
You can't stay shut up
in the house.

101
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,846
What happened about that radio
programme you mentioned?

102
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:00,564
A youth guidance programme
on the radio?

103
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,682
Now?

104
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,119
You've no idea what a
problem that would be.

105
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,079
Auntie, you're not going to smoke?

106
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:10,364
After the lunch we've just had!
Do you want one?

107
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,367
No, besides Adolfo doesn't
like me smoking.

108
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,641
But Adolfo is in Havana,
my dear!

109
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,202
What became of...?

110
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,325
He always asks after you.

111
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,406
Do you still think about him?

112
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,643
We'll probably bump into him.

113
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,565
I don't know why you're
so worked up.

114
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:59,521
It's been fifty years,
Gina, fifty years.

115
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:03,117
A lot of things have changed. I
don't want him to see me like this.

116
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:06,165
- Like what, Auntie?
- Come off it, Gina. Like this.

117
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,967
I was seventeen when
he last saw me.

118
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,243
He's no eighteen-year-old
now, either.

119
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:13,562
Georgina

120
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:14,796
Travieso!

121
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:18,357
Reglita Campoamor!

122
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:20,636
Hello, Gina.

123
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,684
Small world, isn't it?

124
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,917
Guantánamo is, you mean.

125
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:26,526
You haven't changed a bit.

126
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,678
Come on in, both of you.

127
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,161
What's new in Havana?

128
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:32,085
Come in.

129
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,165
Tell me about yourself.
Did you ever get married?

130
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:40,637
So long ago I hardly remember.
My roots are in this town.

131
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:43,196
Why, I've never even been
to Santiago de Cuba.

132
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:44,686
You're joking!

133
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,205
- Have you any children?
- Two. A girl and a boy.

134
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,881
- I'd love to meet them.
- Pop round and visit.

135
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,835
It suits you

136
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,918
to a T. I'm going to buy you it.

137
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:00,799
No, Auntie. I never
go out anywhere.

138
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:04,080
Besides, Adolfo doesn't like
such low necklines.

139
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,322
CULTURE IS IMMORTAL.

140
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:22,476
Citizens of Guantámano!

141
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:24,478
For fifty years,

142
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,636
during which her art has been
acclaimed in theatres

143
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,922
the world over,

144
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,356
Georgina Travieso

145
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:34,078
was not just Georgina Travieso.

146
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,084
For many she was

147
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:37,726
Cecilia Valdés,

148
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,005
or Madame Butterfly,

149
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:44,159
or María la O or Luisa Fernanda...

150
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,958
Look how young you were
up on the bandstand!

151
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:08,642
A mere stripling.

152
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,361
I feel like a naughty girl.

153
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,156
Gina must be looking
for me all over.

154
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:20,437
And that gossip Regla will
have a field day tomorrow.

155
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,156
What about this young girl?

156
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:37,603
I'm sure I've seen her recently.

157
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,236
I can't imagine

158
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,601
who it could be.

159
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,603
I must be going a bit
soft in the head.

160
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:45,806
I don't think you were ever

161
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,003
quite right in the head.

162
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:51,397
How young we were then!

163
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:55,406
Do you know I still have
your blue ribbon?

164
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:57,281
My blue ribbon?

165
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,596
You've forgotten!

166
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,237
Don't you remember,
when you left,

167
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,565
you promised me
you'd return

168
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:08,725
and you gave me your
blue hair ribbon as a token?

169
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:11,116
Now I remember.

170
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,080
You came to see me off.

171
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:15,285
It was raining buckets...

172
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:17,159
No, Cándido, it wasn't raining.

173
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,358
I remember it was
a gorgeous day.

174
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:20,676
Yes it was raining.

175
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,804
I've never since seen a sun
as beautiful as that morning.

176
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:27,244
It was so cloudy

177
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:29,683
I couldn't tell
when night fell.

178
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:31,396
Nightfall?

179
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:34,637
But it was midday, Cándido.

180
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,521
It was night, I tell you, night.

181
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:42,117
How could it be night
when the train left at 1 p.m.?

182
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:43,516
Here it is!

183
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:59,879
<i>I'm like the white swan</i>

184
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:02,925
<i>which dies singing.</i>

185
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,804
How young we were then!

186
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:14,040
When I get sentimental,
do you know what I do?

187
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:21,841
I close my eyes

188
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,166
and imagine things.

189
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:28,004
We're by a river bank,

190
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:30,645
I'm twenty,

191
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,677
and you're sixteen.

192
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:37,437
You look handsome
in your blue suit.

193
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:39,276
Now

194
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:42,724
you're getting the hem of
your dress wet in the river.

195
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:46,800
- Oh, the water's cold!
- You're about to fall and I...

196
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,238
What are you doing?
Mother will see us!

197
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:51,882
I love you.

198
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:55,117
I've loved you these fifty years.

199
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,725
Don't open your eyes.

200
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,283
Imagine that not a
single day has gone by.

201
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,081
I want us to be together
until the end.

202
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:06,606
When I saw you again,

203
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,005
I almost ran away.

204
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,199
I don't know,
I was scared.

205
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:13,715
And I felt pain,

206
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:14,838
here,

207
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,397
in my jaw.

208
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:19,637
But now everything

209
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,001
is going to be different.

210
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,837
We'll never part again.

211
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,442
Isn't that so?

212
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:26,717
Yoyita!

213
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,559
<i>... that dies singing...</i>

214
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:39,236
<i>... dies singing... dies singing...</i>

215
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:40,357
Adolfo!

216
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,041
What? Yes, this has to run
like clockwork... what's up?

217
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:44,362
Listen, your wife's calling.

218
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:45,004
My wife?

219
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,486
She says it's urgent.

220
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:47,682
Excuse me.

221
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:52,126
Hello, Gina.
What's wrong?

222
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:53,683
What?

223
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,562
That's impossible.

224
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:57,116
Can nothing be done?

225
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:01,284
Yes, darling. I'll leave
for the airport right now.

226
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:06,481
Listen, leave everything to me.
Don't you do anything, do you hear?

227
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:09,841
Yes, listen, speak to Felo, to Felo.

228
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,482
Tell him to get busy
with the formalities.

229
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,365
But don't you do anything.

230
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,041
You take it easy, my love.
Do you hear? Yes...

231
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:26,999
Aunt Yoyita!

232
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:01,921
Power cuts here as well?

233
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:07,119
The route is quite clear, Tony.

234
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,676
We bypass Santiago,
go straight to Bayamo,

235
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,280
and then on to Las Tunas.

236
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,757
I'll tell you the other
stops on the way.

237
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:16,718
Guantánamo, Bayamo,
Las Tunas.

238
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:18,317
Okay.

239
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:22,481
We'll follow the hearse
in your "Volga".

240
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:25,681
The corpse ahead and
the uproar behind.

241
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:26,637
Okay.

242
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,121
Adolfo, Cándido wants
to ask you a favour.

243
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,561
Go ahead, Cándido.

244
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:35,321
Listen, Adolfo, I've got
no one left in the world...

245
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:39,082
He wondered if he could accompany
Aunt Yoyita to Havana with us.

246
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:41,238
Of course, Cándido.
You're like one of the family.

247
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,716
I'd already allowed
for such a contingency

248
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:46,879
and requested a permit
for four people.

249
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,042
One moment...

250
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,040
Let's get this ready.

251
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,040
It's all right,
it's all right like that.

252
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,276
Right, Adolfo...

253
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:00,766
Make sure you call Tirso.

254
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,918
Give him the exact
departure time.

255
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,962
SOCIALISM OR DEATH.

256
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,555
<i>Cándido is upset</i>

257
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:46,156
<i>because he has lost</i>
<i>his beloved.</i>

258
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,723
<i>The woman he longed for</i>

259
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,716
<i>has been taken from him</i>
<i>for the second time.</i>

260
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,841
<i>The funeral committee</i>

261
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,116
<i>leaves behind,</i>

262
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:01,606
<i>the East</i>

263
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:06,484
<i>and rolls westward</i>

264
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:10,883
<i>to accomplish its mission.</i>

265
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,045
<i>Guantanamera,</i>

266
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,882
<i>guajira guantanamera,</i>

267
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,562
<i>guantanamera,</i>

268
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:26,519
<i>guajira guantanamera...</i>

269
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,600
Puchi, are you romantic?

270
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:46,882
You bet your balls!

271
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,522
Come on, baby,

272
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:52,925
off you go, I'm in a hurry.

273
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:55,321
You're acting strange.

274
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,237
You've been acting very strange
with me just lately. What's up?

275
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,960
Nothing. I've got to go.

276
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:07,516
Why?

277
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:10,806
You promised you'd take me
to Havana this time.

278
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:14,166
It's just that this trip
came up unexpectedly.

279
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,921
You already told me that one.
I'm too old for stories.

280
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:19,078
I've bet all my aces on you.

281
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,319
Look at the time!
I can't go back home now.

282
00:17:22,487 --> 00:17:25,604
- Well, Marilis, that's how it is.
- What do I get out of it? Nothing!

283
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:29,077
You've used me and now you've
got to take me to Havana.

284
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:33,083
Mariano,

285
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,876
I'm pregnant.

286
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,436
And my husband

287
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:42,442
won't have a baby that's not his.
Is that clear?

288
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:44,280
He won't stand for it.

289
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:45,842
Shit, Marilis!

290
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,957
Listen, don't get all
worked up. Calm down!

291
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:57,116
Bloody well calm down.

292
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:58,515
It's you that's got me into trouble.

293
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:01,440
Wait, we're going to talk
things through.

294
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:04,242
- I promised to take you to Havana.
- Yes.

295
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:07,877
Okay, calm down. I'll take you.
We'll sort things out somehow.

296
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:09,162
- Really?
- Yes.

297
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,521
- Really?
- Yes.

298
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:13,759
Wait for me here then. I'll get
my things and be back in a flash.

299
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:15,440
And we'll set off for Havana.

300
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,766
That looks good!

301
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,203
Ramón!

302
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,522
Listen, Ramón!

303
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:05,877
Lets go.

304
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,400
- Get your stuff, we're off.
- Why? Look at the time.

305
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,602
Come on, mate.

306
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,045
- I'm in real trouble.
- What sort of trouble?

307
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:18,926
- Have you run somebody over?
- No! I'll explain on the way.

308
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:21,760
It's over Marilis. All his
problems are over women.

309
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,806
- Oh no! Leave me out of it.
- That Marilis has gone crazy.

310
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,845
- I don't believe it...
- Come on, I'll explain on the way.

311
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:31,043
Come here. Lets load this rice.

312
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:33,923
O for the day when
I don't have to run off...

313
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,918
Tell her I'm not here.

314
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:48,841
- Marilis, what a coincidence!
- What a coincidence!

315
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:50,042
We were just talking
about you.

316
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,478
- Just now.
- What kind of coincidence?

317
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:54,956
Where's Mariano?

318
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:56,880
He'll be back shortly.

319
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:00,563
He went to cut a bunch of
bananas to take to Havana.

320
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:03,447
He'd do better to cut some
flowers for his funeral

321
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,405
because when I catch him,
I'll murder him. No man

322
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,798
- stands me up.
- Mariano was just saying

323
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,482
- we should pick you up.
- Stop protecting him.

324
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:14,160
You men are all the same.

325
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:17,000
- Leave Ramón out of it!
- He's another prime example.

326
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:21,082
You're the slut! You've been laid
by all the men in La Maya.

327
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:25,035
Sour grapes, because you're fat
and undesirable. I'm going in.

328
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:28,918
Over my dead body!
I won't have whores in my house.

329
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:48,601
How much?

330
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,724
The garlic? A buck
or sixty pesos.

331
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:54,757
A buck, boss.
Interested?

332
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:57,996
Music Man?

333
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:00,564
A buck or sixty pesos.

334
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,080
That's half my wage.

335
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,158
- How many have you got?
- Six.

336
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:06,878
Give me all six.

337
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:10,797
Here.

338
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:17,081
They'll cry out for this
in Havana.

339
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:18,646
Make a bit of room.

340
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:32,279
Hey! Have you got any food?

341
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:34,356
Food?

342
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,235
Only cigarettes and tobacco.

343
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:46,124
<i>The 1,650 acres of beans</i>
<i>planted</i>

344
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:48,437
<i>in the state co-operative</i>
<i>and rural sectors</i>

345
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,167
<i>represent a new</i>
<i>record figure...</i>

346
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:54,239
You undertakers shouldn't
overdo things.

347
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,279
There aren't enough coffins.

348
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,805
<i>... reached 28,</i>

349
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:04,277
<i>smashing the previous</i>
<i>record of 528 acres</i>

350
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:05,880
<i>in the winter harvest.</i>

351
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:10,679
<i>So a new record has been</i>
<i>set in local agriculture.</i>

352
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,718
This is going to be
a real success.

353
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:16,685
Now I'll make a name
for myself.

354
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,955
<i>... decisive result in the national</i>
<i>development plan...</i>

355
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:54,516
Hey, listen, mate.

356
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:57,121
You're an expert in
this witchcraft stuff.

357
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:00,125
Can't you magic away
my problem with women?

358
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:04,085
You can't solve that
with spells, Mariano.

359
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:06,600
It's simpler than that.

360
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,881
But I'm sick of teaching
a reluctant learner.

361
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:13,195
The fancy women

362
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,482
that you always go for

363
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:18,397
think they have rights,
and so make demands:

364
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,839
You can't have other women,

365
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:22,839
you have to marry her,

366
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,759
and take her to Havana.

367
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:27,802
We don't need that hassle, mate.

368
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:31,998
Just imagine if we had those
problems in every town we visited.

369
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:35,717
Take me, I've no problems
with my old lady.

370
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:37,996
But not you.

371
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:41,680
You have to go for
the classy ones.

372
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,835
And to boot, you always
have one up your sleeve.

373
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,799
Make your mind up.

374
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:51,440
Marry one,

375
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:53,839
take her to Havana,

376
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:55,876
be a good husband,

377
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:57,595
do right by her,

378
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:00,401
she's the one who
should be first class.

379
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:02,960
But on the road,

380
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:06,006
a bit on the side
never did any harm.

381
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,881
On the road, well,

382
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:12,558
on the road anything goes,
plump or skinny.

383
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:17,604
I've got my old lady in Havana
and I keep her warm and happy.

384
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,765
She's the one who'll look
after me when I'm old.

385
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:24,160
That's life, Mariano.

386
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,836
Look what happened
to old Manuel.

387
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,398
When he got a bit past it,

388
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,482
all those women he had in tow
couldn't be seen for dust.

389
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:40,483
Only someone who really loves you
puts up with you when you're old.

390
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:43,926
No one went to his wake.

391
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:49,078
They sent his body to the
medical school for dissection.

392
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,635
That's the worst thing:

393
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,638
Knowing you're going
to die alone,

394
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:58,680
with nobody at your side
to close your eyes.

395
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:01,003
Come on, stop dramatizing!

396
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:07,682
Do me a favour.

397
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:10,759
I'm stuck here with the family.
Can you give us a lift?

398
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,758
- Where are you going?
- To Las Tunas.

399
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:21,081
- Three hundred pesos?
- Whatever you say, friend.

400
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:23,283
I just want to get out of here.

401
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:27,563
Up you go, be quick! When
I'm loaded up, this is risky.

402
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:29,162
Let's hurry!

403
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,999
Get a move on there!

404
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:12,243
Miss...

405
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:15,881
- Can you let us jump the queue?
- Sorry, I can't.

406
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:18,356
Look, we've got a corpse
to take to Havana.

407
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,245
Yes, love, I appreciate
your problem,

408
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:23,240
but all we've got here
is tamarind juice.

409
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:26,444
- Fine, I'll take five.
- I'm sorry, love,

410
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:30,122
but until the ice arrives,
I can't start selling.

411
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:40,084
Order two coffees,
I'm going to the toilet.

412
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,125
Two coffees, pal.

413
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:07,365
I could do with a little water.

414
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:15,799
The manager, please.

415
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:18,597
Thanks.

416
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,076
Sorry!

417
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,642
Professor!

418
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:39,723
Mariano.

419
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:48,718
- Are you working here?
- No.

420
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:51,037
Well, yes. That's where I work.

421
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:54,520
- Didn't you finish University?
- Yes, I did.

422
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:56,276
I became an engineer.

423
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:57,843
Well?

424
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:00,482
You can imagine.

425
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:02,959
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

426
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:07,841
It's not too hard.

427
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:09,675
I even earn more.

428
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:10,923
Good.

429
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:14,839
- Are you just out for a drive?
- No.

430
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:18,761
No. We're taking my aunt,
to Havana to be buried.

431
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:20,116
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:25,155
You gave up teaching.

433
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:28,440
No, it's just that we went
back to Guantánamo.

434
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:37,955
But this is a government emergency.
Look, here's the service order.

435
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,557
I'm sorry, young man, but
we only take dollars here.

436
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:44,161
Perhaps further on
they can help you.

437
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,326
- Come on.
- Right.

438
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,244
I behaved like a kid.

439
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:11,320
The last time I saw her,

440
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:14,037
I slipped a note inside her book,

441
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,726
and then I never saw her again.

442
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:18,999
I never went back
to the University.

443
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:21,640
That must have been...

444
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:24,201
three years ago.

445
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,925
She remembered my name.

446
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:32,205
Sounds like one of those
TV soap operas.

447
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:35,842
Don't take offence, mate,
but it's true.

448
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:41,525
I was mad about that woman.

449
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,080
She was your teacher, then?

450
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:46,237
- What subject?
- Economics.

451
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:51,876
So she knows how to get
out of this mess, right?

452
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:56,205
Socialist political economics
was what she taught me.

453
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:59,404
But don't get the idea she was
dogmatic. Quite the opposite.

454
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:00,756
Her classes were...

455
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:04,041
Besides, what she said
made you think.

456
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:06,159
She got into real
trouble for it.

457
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:11,036
Because there was another teacher
there who really was obsessive.

458
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,199
She taught scientific communism.

459
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,278
- What?
- Just imagine.

460
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,516
Explain.

461
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:19,202
Well, she talked about
what paradise would be like.

462
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:21,439
The land of plenty.

463
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:23,086
Good grief!

464
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,642
Now I believe they call it
scientific socialism.

465
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:30,682
Any day now they'll be calling
it scientific capitalism.

466
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:31,962
That's a good one!

467
00:30:42,647 --> 00:30:43,966
How far are you going, pal?

468
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:48,283
Bayamo and then Las Tunas.
I have to pick up some goods.

469
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:52,526
All aboard for Las Tunas!

470
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,403
- Look, nice and ripe.
- How much?

471
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:34,001
- Only fifty per kilo.
- I'll take a bunch.

472
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:38,359
No, the price is in dollars.
Fifty bucks a kilo, boss.

473
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:39,562
Give me some.

474
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:41,123
There you are.

475
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:43,283
Thanks.

476
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,122
Have one, Georgina.

477
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:48,845
- Music Man.
- Thanks.

478
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:50,763
Thanks.

479
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:53,159
Your change, friend.
Thank you very much.

480
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:54,316
Here, Adolfo.

481
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:20,518
Tony!

482
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:22,083
Tony!

483
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,995
Would you mind very much
turning off the radio?

484
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:29,879
- Okay, Music Man, sorry.
- Just a minute, Tony.

485
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:35,277
I only asked if he'd mind
turning the music off.

486
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,282
I don't think

487
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:41,597
it's the best moment
for celebrating.

488
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:45,161
Well, I'll be...!

489
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:47,956
Give 'em an inch and
they take a mile.

490
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,516
Adolfo, please!

491
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:54,960
Okay, Cándido, okay.

492
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,764
I only had the radio on to hear
the weather forecast.

493
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:03,157
I'm upset about Aunt Yoyita, too.

494
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:06,479
But if everybody starts
doing what they feel like,

495
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:07,966
where will it all end?

496
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,395
Okay, no problem.

497
00:33:13,487 --> 00:33:14,397
Turn it off.

498
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:21,721
During the 16th, 17th
and 18th centuries,

499
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:26,406
Bayamo was the most important
smuggling centre on the island.

500
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:29,677
In this way they made a
mockery of restrictions

501
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:32,042
and the rigid trade monopoly

502
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:33,886
of the Spanish Crown,

503
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:36,676
which stifled economic growth.

504
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:41,321
Illegal trade with the
English, French and...

505
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:50,282
Illegal trade with the
English, French and Dutch

506
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,563
was practised by
all the locals,

507
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:56,515
including the administrative,
military and religious authorities.

508
00:33:56,807 --> 00:34:00,004
Their dealings with the
Protestants, branded as heretics,

509
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:02,955
not only influenced
economic growth,

510
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:05,921
but also affected cultural
and political life.

511
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:09,837
Through this channel, the doors
were opened for books banned

512
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,204
by the Inquisition and the liberal
and progressive ideas of the time.

513
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:16,158
It was no coincidence
that Bayamo was

514
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:19,120
the first city to rise in arms

515
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,084
against the colonial domination

516
00:34:21,247 --> 00:34:24,080
which was stifling the
development of the country.

517
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:56,997
Close it up.

518
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:01,001
- The toilet?
- At the back on the right.

519
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:06,637
I'm going to have some coffee made.
There's no snack today.

520
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:11,722
Adolfo, I've been thinking.
This system costs the same.

521
00:35:11,887 --> 00:35:13,240
The mileage is the same.

522
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:16,599
But the use of resources
is economically fairer,

523
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,359
and in accord with the
national planning system.

524
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,518
Adolfo, I'm an economist.

525
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:24,125
Don't you realize, then, that
invoicing the critical route

526
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,403
guarantees company
management at all levels?

527
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:29,559
Moreover, it makes for a better
distribution of the social product,

528
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:34,001
not to mention more efficient
statistical records.

529
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:38,119
You may be an expert economist,
but administration has you beat.

530
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:40,360
What about the sufferers?

531
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,079
The dead don't suffer.

532
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:45,915
And as for the living...

533
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:47,803
Okay.

534
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,602
You know best.

535
00:35:58,007 --> 00:35:58,962
Look, Gina.

536
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,602
You know what this
could mean for me.

537
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:07,964
For us.

538
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:13,964
You know how important
appearances are in this country.

539
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:15,716
Statistics...

540
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:18,955
Give me a break for once!

541
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:32,757
Cándido...

542
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:35,600
Cándido, please,

543
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,525
don't take any notice of Adolfo.

544
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:40,675
He's under a lot of strain.

545
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:44,283
This relay system was his idea,
and he thinks that, if it works,

546
00:36:44,527 --> 00:36:47,280
he might win back
their confidence.

547
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:49,322
You know that

548
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:51,924
someone who got as far as he did

549
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:54,881
only to be assigned
the job of undertaker...

550
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,716
It's not easy.

551
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:02,961
- Shall we have a drop of coffee?
- No.

552
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:05,000
I'll bring you one anyway.

553
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:30,757
Cándido, your coffee.

554
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:35,160
Do you not feel well, Cándido?

555
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,804
Let's go outside.
I'll take your coffee.

556
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:41,527
Let's go out for some
fresh air.

557
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,120
Hey, hey!

558
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:48,557
Be careful!

559
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:49,843
Watch out!

560
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:53,325
Idiot!

561
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:55,077
Hey!

562
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:56,482
What's the matter?

563
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:59,438
- What's wrong?
- My wife's in labour.

564
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:01,120
- Bloody hell!
- Oh, blessed St. Barbara!

565
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:03,801
- Speak to my boss.
- Not in there, woman!

566
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:05,559
Not in that car,
in this one.

567
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:07,843
Can you take us to Bayamo?

568
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:10,965
But we're on our way to Las Tunas.
We've just come from Bayamo.

569
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:12,685
She can't wait.
Bayamo isn't far.

570
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:14,678
But this is a funeral,
a funeral...!

571
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,361
And they're having a baby.
A birth!

572
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:18,516
Blessed

573
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:19,676
St. Barbara. Help!

574
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,997
Hey, Adolfo, it's not
the car's fault.

575
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:25,480
It's okay, calm down.
Adolfo, we're taking her!

576
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:27,275
Hang on, baby!

577
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,726
Get into the hearse and
wait for us in Las Tunas.

578
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:34,443
Come on! I've got to take
this woman. Come on!

579
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:37,885
Take it easy.

580
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:44,086
Hang on, baby, hang on!

581
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,446
You're crazy!

582
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:43,403
- I didn't need a lift to Havana.
- Listen, let me explain.

583
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:46,240
Because I've found someone
forty times the man you are.

584
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:49,046
Do you hear? I don't need you!
Bastard! Do you hear?

585
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:51,285
- I don't need you!
- Shit!

586
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:55,242
- Fucking hell!
- Hey, cut it out!

587
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:57,238
That'll teach you to
have more respect.

588
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:58,562
To the hospital!

589
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:00,041
Let's see.

590
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:03,639
That needs stitching. It looks
really bad. Yes, to Bayamo.

591
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:08,039
I'll unhook the trailer and go back
to Bayamo. I'll be back in an hour.

592
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,238
- No...
- I'll be back in an hour!

593
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:12,798
If you don't like the idea, walk!

594
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,646
Press to stop the bleeding.

595
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:17,202
S.O.S. Can you hear me? Over.

596
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:20,679
<i>Patrol here. Identify</i>
<i>yourself. Over.</i>

597
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:22,760
We have an emergency.

598
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,844
A woman in labour.

599
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:28,758
This is special service car N°13
from the base in Guantánamo.

600
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,680
<i>From the American naval base</i>
<i>in Guantánamo? Over.</i>

601
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,077
No, from the city of Guantánamo...

602
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:36,966
From the special service
taxi base N°13.

603
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:38,003
Listen,

604
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,159
we're on the Las Tunas-Bayamo
road, heading for Bayamo. Over.

605
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:43,240
<i>I read you.</i>
<i>Take it easy.</i>

606
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,046
Take it easy!
You're bloody joking!

607
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,001
<i>State exact position. Over.</i>

608
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,198
Well, she's in the back seat.

609
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,039
<i>Where? Repeat, please.</i>

610
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:56,478
Six miles from Bayamo,
on the highway. Over.

611
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,727
<i>Don't lose your patience, miss.</i>

612
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,004
Yamilé, she's called Yamilé.

613
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,005
The daughter of Tomás the islander.

614
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,480
<i>We'll send an escort.</i>

615
00:41:07,887 --> 00:41:09,525
<i>Be patient. Over.</i>

616
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,484
- Pant!
- Pant, pant!

617
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:23,156
Careful with the baby!

618
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:25,922
Hey, doc!

619
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:31,516
She looks just like me.

620
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:33,486
She's just like me, driver.

621
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,042
Thanks, mate.

622
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:07,967
Hey, Mariano, let's go, okay?

623
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:20,761
Pardon me for saying so,

624
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:22,400
but it's a relief to be free

625
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:23,596
of your husband.

626
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:27,235
I'm as honest as I am ugly,

627
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:29,603
and now that we're alone,
as the saying goes,

628
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,482
I've a proposition to make.

629
00:42:32,207 --> 00:42:35,358
Up ahead, I've got a friend
who runs a "paladar",

630
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:37,525
a clandestine inn.

631
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:39,758
It's a clean, decent place,

632
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:42,521
and for one peso we can eat
a great amarillo with pork.

633
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:44,840
I've got a few bucks on me,

634
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:46,884
so three can eat as well as one.

635
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:49,515
Thanks, Tony, but I've got
some dollars too.

636
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:51,678
The problem is,
if we're late back,

637
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:53,246
Adólfo will hit the roof.

638
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:57,640
If he can wait for important
things, he can wait for this.

639
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,363
Adolfo needn't find out.

640
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:04,166
Besides, he's half an hour
ahead of schedule.

641
00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:05,676
He said. So himself.

642
00:43:07,447 --> 00:43:08,197
Believe me,

643
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:13,085
Adolfo is capable of taking us
to Havana on just two bananas.

644
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:26,159
Come on, Cándido.
In you go.

645
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,037
Paco!

646
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:32,243
Paco!

647
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:39,765
- What brings you here, brother?
- Customers.

648
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:43,076
We need a pork amarillo
on the double.

649
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:44,236
On the double!

650
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:45,681
Okay. Raulito!

651
00:43:45,887 --> 00:43:48,355
Put a cloth on this table.
Come in.

652
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:49,676
Get my seat ready.

653
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:56,557
Here you are.

654
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:01,325
- How much?
- 25. Genuine article.

655
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:05,003
Twenty... and a few bananas.

656
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:09,526
You're like Yoyita.

657
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:13,520
In name only.
We're both called Georgina.

658
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:17,477
There's something else,
I don't know but...

659
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:21,406
You really loved her,
didn't you?

660
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:29,566
She had such a desire to live!

661
00:44:31,927 --> 00:44:32,598
She?

662
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:33,843
Or you?

663
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:47,159
Hey, be careful! Go gently!

664
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:49,397
- Handle it with care!
- It slipped, boss.

665
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,398
Can't you do this
some other time?

666
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:53,922
Don't worry.
This is straighforward.

667
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:57,602
We'll have the changeover
done in ten minutes.

668
00:44:57,767 --> 00:45:00,361
Everything was going fine,
but now my plan's gone to pot.

669
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:01,676
Listen,

670
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:03,276
Justo rang

671
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:06,121
and I told him you'd left
for Camagüey.

672
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:09,324
Hey, don't get worked up.

673
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:12,081
You've had problems with
your blood pressure already.

674
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:15,321
Come on, let's have a coffee.

675
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:20,482
If it hadn't been for
that bloody baby...!

676
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:29,442
Excuse me, I'll wait
for you outside.

677
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:35,879
- You've hardly touched your food.
- Neither have you.

678
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:37,884
We old people get by on little.

679
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,555
Loneliness is the worst
sort of hunger.

680
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,437
Oh, Cándido, you're not alone.

681
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:48,440
People are really fond of you.
Besides, you've got your memories

682
00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:49,642
of Aunt Yoyita.

683
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:54,197
You know,

684
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:58,040
all my life I've been waiting
for a miracle.

685
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:02,725
I thought that some day I'd get to
play in the Symphony Orchestra.

686
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:06,924
Maybe I was afraid to look fate
in the eye. Who knows?

687
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,764
Yoyita became famous,

688
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:11,241
but me...

689
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:12,835
Stuck in Gantánamo,

690
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:14,235
with my saxhorn!

691
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:15,556
Oh, Cándido!

692
00:46:18,327 --> 00:46:19,476
Damn it!

693
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:24,485
Fifty years putting off
a trip to Havana!

694
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:32,756
My life kept getting
smaller and smaller

695
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:38,521
my friends started dying,
or left the country.

696
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:43,242
It's always other people
who die.

697
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:47,599
You never think about death
until one fine day,

698
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:49,526
there it is,

699
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:50,881
right under your nose.

700
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:06,080
Are you people coming to eat?

701
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:08,960
- No, we brought our own food.
- Okay, I'll only be ten minutes.

702
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:11,319
- How's things?
- Hey, how's things?

703
00:47:11,487 --> 00:47:12,966
- How's business?
- Quiet.

704
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:15,687
- We'll liven it up for you.
- Come on in.

705
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:17,362
What happened to you?

706
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:24,077
Professor!

707
00:47:24,687 --> 00:47:25,517
Mariano!

708
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:27,646
Cándido, look, it's Mariano.

709
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:30,362
- Don't get up. How do you do.
- How do you do.

710
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:32,279
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

711
00:47:36,847 --> 00:47:38,121
I'm not a professor now,

712
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:39,356
just Gina.

713
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,080
The food's good here,
isn't it?

714
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:44,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

715
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:48,083
- Do you feel ill?
- No, no...

716
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:50,086
If you'll excuse me...

717
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,124
I'm just going to the toilet.

718
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:56,836
What a coincidence!

719
00:47:57,847 --> 00:48:00,361
Meeting three times
in the same day

720
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,085
after so long without
seeing each other!

721
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:03,566
Yes, it's odd.

722
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,440
Why were you at the hospital?

723
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:06,837
Nothing...

724
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:09,043
- Mi colleague had an accident.
- Really?

725
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:11,641
Yes, we ran into a...

726
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,158
a cow in the road.

727
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,600
But it was nothing serious.
He just bumped his forehead.

728
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:20,435
- Why were you there?
- Another accident.

729
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:24,122
But different. I was with a girl
who gave birth to a lovely daughter.

730
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,286
But, weren't you going to a funeral?

731
00:48:27,927 --> 00:48:29,246
Well, there you are...

732
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:31,399
Some depart and others arrive.

733
00:48:32,087 --> 00:48:33,315
That's life, right?

734
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,077
Gina,

735
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,115
do you still teach?

736
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:41,206
Don't be so formal.

737
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,037
Do you still teach?

738
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:44,478
No.

739
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,037
I got tired of hitting my head
against a brick wall.

740
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:49,882
Shame!

741
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,797
But still, you're an intelligent

742
00:48:52,967 --> 00:48:54,844
woman with millions
of opportunities.

743
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:55,803
Thanks.

744
00:48:57,247 --> 00:48:58,965
It's not the end of the world,

745
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:00,517
is it?

746
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:04,965
And in the end, I reckon
the brick wall yields.

747
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:06,361
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

748
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:08,203
You...

749
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:10,759
You know that better than anyone.

750
00:49:12,047 --> 00:49:15,119
Do you remember? Everything
changes, everything evolves.

751
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:16,322
Dialectics!

752
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:22,838
I'm so glad I bumped into you.

753
00:49:23,567 --> 00:49:25,125
It was me who
bumped into you.

754
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,799
I shouldn't have written
that note.

755
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,160
But I had to tell you somehow.

756
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:39,362
Mariano, please.

757
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,398
Yes,

758
00:49:41,807 --> 00:49:42,796
forgive me, but...

759
00:49:45,287 --> 00:49:48,199
So you became an engineer!
Tell me all about it.

760
00:49:49,407 --> 00:49:50,157
Gina...

761
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,440
I'd write you the same note.

762
00:49:58,007 --> 00:49:58,962
I must leave.

763
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:14,759
It was a beautiful letter.

764
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:23,482
God, I...!

765
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,837
Careful there,
gently does it!

766
00:50:42,327 --> 00:50:42,918
Goodness!

767
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:47,042
You've got the best
car in the country.

768
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:48,640
We should be on
the road by now.

769
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:51,639
Where the devil are
those people?

770
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:55,085
Calm down! You're not going
to put out a fire!

771
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:15,162
THE TIME HAS COME
TO PRESERVE OUR DREAMS.

772
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:17,564
About bloody time!

773
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:20,841
Where have you been?

774
00:51:21,087 --> 00:51:24,682
- Come in and have something to eat.
- No, thank you. Here.

775
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:26,803
- What's this?
- A snack I bought you in a café.

776
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:28,719
Come on, let's get going!

777
00:52:00,847 --> 00:52:02,360
Gina, come on!

778
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:06,675
<i>When a flower wilts and dies,</i>

779
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:12,205
<i>another springs up in its place.</i>

780
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:16,927
<i>And if a love is lost,</i>

781
00:52:19,087 --> 00:52:21,760
<i>Life takes on another love.</i>

782
00:52:24,527 --> 00:52:26,882
<i>Mariano remembers Gina,</i>

783
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:31,927
<i>Gina remembers Mariano.</i>

784
00:52:33,927 --> 00:52:36,566
<i>It needn't be a barren memory</i>

785
00:52:38,287 --> 00:52:42,644
<i>the one which springs up</i>
<i>between them.</i>

786
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:49,962
One,

787
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,037
two.

788
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:55,477
One,

789
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:58,522
two.

790
00:52:59,807 --> 00:53:00,637
One,

791
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:03,797
two.

792
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:48,438
The deceased's sister and niece
have been calling from Havana.

793
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,518
They're concerned
about the delay.

794
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:53,918
What do they expect? We've
stuck to the original plan exactly.

795
00:53:54,127 --> 00:53:56,595
- We're in Camagüey as scheduled.
- Now comes the difficult bit.

796
00:53:56,927 --> 00:53:58,679
Camagüey to Santa Clara.

797
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:00,685
With a brief stop
in Sancti Spíritus.

798
00:54:00,847 --> 00:54:02,599
Remember!
That bitch Paula's there!

799
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:05,565
There are people in the cafeteria
pretending to be bereaved.

800
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:07,285
Can't you sort it out?
Are you all asleep?

801
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:08,960
One moment, your ticket.

802
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:13,477
- Haven't you got a ticket?
- Just a minute.

803
00:54:14,487 --> 00:54:17,763
There's a sign here that clearly
says this café is only for mourners.

804
00:54:17,927 --> 00:54:19,997
- I'm a mourner.
- So am I.

805
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:21,964
Is that so?
Well, I'm not having it.

806
00:54:22,647 --> 00:54:26,720
Listen, here the snacks and the
coffee are ordered in advance.

807
00:54:27,527 --> 00:54:29,518
And its all paid for
by the close relatives.

808
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:31,723
Excuse me, what's
the problem, sir?

809
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:34,879
My uncle died last week but
nobody gave me a free snack!

810
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:38,483
- We all have the same rights here.
- Yes, no more privileges!

811
00:54:38,647 --> 00:54:39,966
Anyone would think this was...!

812
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:43,960
Comrades, comrades!

813
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:49,441
I've been waiting ages
and they've not given me anything.

814
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:52,321
I have a ticket and I'm entitled.

815
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:54,883
I know my rights.

816
00:54:55,047 --> 00:54:57,641
Everybody out!

817
00:55:03,687 --> 00:55:04,358
You too.

818
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:06,443
You too.

819
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:08,006
I want everybody out!

820
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:10,596
Now! The cafeteria's closed.

821
00:55:10,927 --> 00:55:12,406
That's the way to do it!

822
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,723
Dead dogs don't bite.

823
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:24,806
I've got used to it.

824
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:27,766
It's the best way.
You suffer less.

825
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:30,124
You have your whole
life ahead of you.

826
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:31,636
Ah, Cándido!

827
00:55:31,887 --> 00:55:35,277
I think I missed my chance
without even noticing.

828
00:55:36,927 --> 00:55:37,882
Are you sure?

829
00:55:38,727 --> 00:55:39,523
I don't know.

830
00:55:41,647 --> 00:55:43,160
How do you recognize it?

831
00:55:44,047 --> 00:55:45,526
It all happens so fast.

832
00:55:46,807 --> 00:55:47,762
You feel it.

833
00:55:49,727 --> 00:55:51,524
It's something special, like...

834
00:55:52,447 --> 00:55:54,278
having and itchy jaw.

835
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:58,718
Has yourjaw never itched?

836
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:01,959
Cándido, I'm a married woman!

837
00:56:03,687 --> 00:56:05,439
You're blind, that's what you are.

838
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:28,084
Ramón, how are you?

839
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:31,365
Oh, darling, I've been waiting.

840
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:34,837
Oh, my sweet, I love you.
What took you so long?

841
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:36,960
Hey, honey, listen.

842
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,516
- I can't stay. I'm pushed for time.
- Yes, come one down.

843
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,520
Hey, give me that. I can't!
Give me that back.

844
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:48,795
Listen, the lorry broke down
and I really haven't got time!

845
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:52,004
Let's go to the house and I'll do
something that you'll just love.

846
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,078
- Come on!
- Come here, love. I'm not joking.

847
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:55,316
Hey, listen.

848
00:56:55,487 --> 00:56:58,001
I've been thinking, it's about
time I took life seriously.

849
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:01,364
I'm so glad, honey.
I've been thinking the same

850
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:03,836
We should live together
and be happy.

851
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,362
Let's go to the house,
I want to do things to you.

852
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:08,119
Come on, baby...

853
00:57:08,527 --> 00:57:10,961
- What's up?
- Let's go to the house.

854
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:11,877
Ramón,

855
00:57:12,487 --> 00:57:13,806
we'll be right back.
Be good.

856
00:57:14,087 --> 00:57:15,918
Hey, honey, what's your hurry?

857
00:57:33,127 --> 00:57:34,196
Hey, what's going on?

858
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:36,722
Where's the linesman?

859
00:57:37,727 --> 00:57:41,037
- Honey, get dressed, we've no time.
- After this,

860
00:57:41,647 --> 00:57:43,444
you'll never forget me.

861
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:45,322
I love you.

862
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,924
- Come to me.
- We haven't time.

863
00:57:49,087 --> 00:57:50,281
I love you, come...

864
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:54,805
- I've got to go!
- I'll say things I've never said.

865
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:58,236
Linesman!

866
00:57:58,567 --> 00:58:00,205
Listen! They're calling you.

867
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:02,040
- Me?
- Yes, you.

868
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,242
What's the matter?

869
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,923
What! Raise this barrier right now.
There isn't a train in sight.

870
00:58:14,087 --> 00:58:16,396
Wait there, I'm coming!
Why all the hurry?

871
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:24,044
Get this jalopy rolling.
Come on, men, let's go.

872
00:58:24,487 --> 00:58:25,920
Oh, my love, these people never

873
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,202
leave you in peace.

874
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:40,916
God! The train!

875
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:06,483
Hilda!

876
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:07,998
Hilda!

877
00:59:08,487 --> 00:59:09,283
Hilda!

878
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:12,156
Hey, move that.
Are you mad?

879
00:59:12,527 --> 00:59:13,755
Mad about you, my love.

880
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,758
I'm not moving until
you give me a kiss.

881
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,155
Besides, look!

882
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:22,519
Look what I've got you!
Mammee apple!

883
00:59:22,687 --> 00:59:24,166
I'm coming! I'm coming!

884
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,717
Hail Mary, God Almighty! Why won't
they let me finish with you?

885
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:29,599
Don't budge, baby.

886
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:32,235
I'm going to do something
to you that you'll love.

887
00:59:32,407 --> 00:59:34,398
- Hey, what's that all about?
- Oh, it's...

888
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:38,276
It's nothing. Don't get jealous.
I'm all yours, you know that.

889
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:41,158
I'm crazy about you.

890
00:59:41,727 --> 00:59:42,955
Open up, open up!

891
00:59:45,367 --> 00:59:46,277
Adolfo!

892
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:50,356
Now what's wrong?

893
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:52,685
The fan belt's broken.

894
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:54,599
- You've got a spare, haven't you?
- I haven't got anything.

895
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:57,327
- Why the bloody hell not?
- What about you?

896
00:59:57,487 --> 00:59:59,045
Have you got a spare liver, eh?

897
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:00,681
You're going to need it!

898
01:00:01,527 --> 01:00:02,596
We must do something.

899
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:06,763
- That's more like it!
- Now! I want clockwork precision.

900
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:09,677
We're 15 miles from Camagüey,

901
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:12,124
90 miles from Sancti Spíritus.

902
01:00:12,607 --> 01:00:15,997
You, go with me. You, in the Volga.
I must sort this out with Rivero.

903
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:19,645
You, watch the car.

904
01:00:21,007 --> 01:00:21,564
Hey!

905
01:00:22,407 --> 01:00:25,922
- What's the problem, mate?
- The fan belt's gone.

906
01:00:26,087 --> 01:00:27,566
Why didn't you say?

907
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:29,679
I've got a spare one.

908
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,555
I always carry one in
the back of the lorry.

909
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:35,996
Let's see what size it is.

910
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:39,399
- I'll go and fetch one.
- Good man!

911
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:42,718
What are you doing? No, no!
Heaven forbid! Me, charge you?

912
01:00:42,887 --> 01:00:46,277
Take advantage of this situation?
You can have it. Put that away.

913
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:47,402
Thanks, son.

914
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:03,879
Let me pass!
Let me pass!

915
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,640
I'm leaving.

916
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:09,005
I've got to get back to work.

917
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:28,884
That's just about got it.

918
01:01:34,247 --> 01:01:35,646
You can start it now.

919
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:39,158
Me?

920
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:47,764
Gina!

921
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,682
Mariano!

922
01:02:39,207 --> 01:02:40,526
You asshole!

923
01:02:43,447 --> 01:02:46,803
- What are you doing with her?
- Listen, calm down, calm down!

924
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,603
What's up?

925
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:51,961
- I'll kill you!
- Calm down, there's been a mix-up.

926
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:53,162
We're going, Cándido.

927
01:02:53,727 --> 01:02:54,637
Get in.

928
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:57,275
- Where to? Get in where?
- In the car! Get in the car!

929
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,079
- This one?
- Yes!

930
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:08,037
- What's the matter, Gina?
- Nothing.

931
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:09,636
Nothing's the matter.

932
01:03:23,407 --> 01:03:25,125
You really dropped me in it
with that jalopy.

933
01:03:25,287 --> 01:03:28,643
Listen, Adolfo, while you've got
that car, I have to bury my dead

934
01:03:28,807 --> 01:03:31,719
with a horse drawn carriage.
What planet are you living on?

935
01:03:31,887 --> 01:03:33,081
You're responsible
for this disaster,

936
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:34,396
and you have to find a solution!

937
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:36,478
I haven't got a fan belt
for that car!

938
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:39,320
- Get it into your thick head!
- Look for one, then!

939
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,443
- Look where?
- Take one from another car.

940
01:03:42,087 --> 01:03:44,521
This is sabotage! And the
consequences could be serious!

941
01:03:45,247 --> 01:03:46,839
Listen a minute, Adolfo.

942
01:03:47,247 --> 01:03:49,477
Let's find a solution.

943
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:52,759
You know I'm no amateur in this.
I've got a clean record...

944
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,397
What happened?

945
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,523
Nothing, he found a fan belt and...

946
01:04:27,327 --> 01:04:28,362
Come on, Cándido.

947
01:04:28,687 --> 01:04:29,881
Get in there.

948
01:04:31,127 --> 01:04:34,085
We'll use the hearse and have it
sent back to Rivero later.

949
01:04:34,247 --> 01:04:35,919
Come on, let's not waste
any more time.

950
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:11,361
- What's up?
- The usual. A corpse.

951
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:13,558
- It has to be buried in Cárdenas.
- So what?

952
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,003
I've no more hearses! We're in a
state of necrological alert here!

953
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:20,399
But if they say he lived here,
why don't they bury him here?

954
01:05:21,887 --> 01:05:23,161
Old man Orlando

955
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:25,119
stated in his will

956
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:28,438
that if he died in Cárdenas, he
was to be buried in Sancti Spíritus,

957
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:32,004
and if he died in Sancti Spíritus,
he was to be buried in Cárdenas.

958
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:33,356
What for?

959
01:05:33,567 --> 01:05:34,761
Just to fuck someone up.

960
01:05:35,287 --> 01:05:36,356
And you're that someone.

961
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:38,280
Do you know what this means?

962
01:05:39,207 --> 01:05:40,686
We'll have to dovetail the services.

963
01:05:40,887 --> 01:05:42,445
But I've got to get to Havana!

964
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:45,963
And old Orlando to Cárdenas.
The law is the same for everyone.

965
01:05:47,087 --> 01:05:49,078
But this is something unexpected.

966
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:51,245
Death is always unexpected.

967
01:05:51,487 --> 01:05:53,398
You should know that, from yourjob.

968
01:05:58,127 --> 01:06:00,402
- Where's the office, please?
- Up there.

969
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:01,317
Thank you.

970
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:07,676
Adolfo, what did the old lady
die of?

971
01:06:09,087 --> 01:06:10,202
Being a whore.

972
01:06:11,687 --> 01:06:13,643
At her age she starts having it off

973
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,445
- with a ridiculous old man...
- I won't stand for that!

974
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:16,517
Listen, I didn't...

975
01:06:16,927 --> 01:06:19,885
Have some respect for the dead!

976
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:29,482
Have a good trip.

977
01:06:31,607 --> 01:06:33,006
That was quite ajob!

978
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:38,722
Okay, Susi,

979
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:40,844
remember about next week.

980
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:42,235
Okay, big boy.

981
01:06:42,407 --> 01:06:45,638
Next week they're bringing me the
black beans and turkeys I ordered.

982
01:06:45,927 --> 01:06:48,282
Take care, and don't get lost, okay?

983
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:51,245
- Why should I want to do that?
- I love you.

984
01:06:51,727 --> 01:06:52,955
You're such a sweetie.

985
01:06:54,207 --> 01:06:55,720
Look after the pig, okay?

986
01:06:56,087 --> 01:06:57,918
- And look after yourself.
- Yes. Let's go.

987
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,275
What's up now, Ramón?

988
01:07:32,727 --> 01:07:33,603
Get out.

989
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,798
- What?
- I said get out.

990
01:07:36,207 --> 01:07:37,196
What for?

991
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:40,400
Because we need to fill up
with petrol, Mariano,

992
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:43,001
and who's in the next
petrol station? Wina!

993
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:46,200
Your women are too aggressive.
I don't want any part of it.

994
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:47,880
No, man. Wina's no problem.

995
01:07:49,767 --> 01:07:51,280
I'm the one who's in a mess!

996
01:07:52,927 --> 01:07:53,803
Why?

997
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:55,560
No reason. Let's get going.

998
01:07:56,807 --> 01:07:59,037
Hey, come on, brother. I told you,
there won't be any hassle.

999
01:08:02,607 --> 01:08:03,960
Oh, Mariano, shit...

1000
01:08:22,247 --> 01:08:23,236
Mariano!

1001
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:29,117
What?

1002
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:34,846
I have to talk to you about...

1003
01:08:35,087 --> 01:08:36,281
What's up, Mariano?

1004
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:37,800
No, nothing.

1005
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:40,677
Well, yes...

1006
01:08:41,887 --> 01:08:44,196
I like you a lot.

1007
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:46,806
- Well...
- Mariano,

1008
01:08:47,367 --> 01:08:49,164
I got married two weeks ago.

1009
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:51,643
You're kidding!

1010
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:54,357
Fuck me!

1011
01:08:56,287 --> 01:08:57,197
That's great...!

1012
01:08:57,607 --> 01:08:58,722
Don't pretend, Mariano.

1013
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:00,680
You came to ditch me.

1014
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:01,884
Me?

1015
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:02,923
Yes, you.

1016
01:09:09,407 --> 01:09:10,237
How's things?

1017
01:09:10,487 --> 01:09:11,158
Fine.

1018
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:12,595
Let's have a coffee.

1019
01:09:13,647 --> 01:09:14,397
Ramón!

1020
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:15,926
Come and have a coffee.

1021
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:18,322
Come and have a coffee.

1022
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,398
No, it's okay, thanks.

1023
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:22,603
Come on, there's no problem.
Come on!

1024
01:09:30,647 --> 01:09:31,602
Wina!

1025
01:09:44,087 --> 01:09:45,440
Have you got a pen?

1026
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:55,046
What's up now, Mariano?

1027
01:10:04,927 --> 01:10:07,680
Hey, wait there, brother.

1028
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:09,443
Hey!

1029
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:24,760
I'm sorry, but I'm going on alone.

1030
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:28,527
I'm so ashamed.
It was all so unpleasant.

1031
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:31,281
Why? It has nothing
to do with you.

1032
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:34,001
- You don't belong with that animal.
- Don't be like that.

1033
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:36,840
Pay no attention to him. Don't you
realize that he's insensitive?

1034
01:10:37,287 --> 01:10:40,438
It's because he is insensitive
that you don't belong with him.

1035
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:43,637
I'm the one who feels sad

1036
01:10:44,087 --> 01:10:45,042
really sad,

1037
01:10:45,647 --> 01:10:48,525
when I see how you're throwing
your life away on that man.

1038
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:51,517
- It's not fair!
- Oh, Cándido.

1039
01:10:51,887 --> 01:10:54,685
There are times in life when
you have to make decisions.

1040
01:10:55,087 --> 01:10:56,884
I've made mine.

1041
01:10:58,207 --> 01:10:59,037
Oh, look.

1042
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:03,038
It's the deceased's granddaughter.

1043
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,803
Thanks to them
I'll get to Cárdenas.

1044
01:11:06,327 --> 01:11:07,965
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

1045
01:11:08,127 --> 01:11:09,037
Pleased to meet you.

1046
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:11,202
Take care.

1047
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:12,683
Great care.

1048
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:14,645
- Bye.
- See you soon.

1049
01:11:21,727 --> 01:11:23,479
- Gina.
- Yes?

1050
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:27,117
I don't like to interfere,
but I was just passing...

1051
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:28,800
What's up? Talking again?

1052
01:11:29,007 --> 01:11:31,885
Come on. We've wasted
enough time. Gina. Come on.

1053
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:37,716
Well, we'll be seeing you.

1054
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:39,520
Make sure you tell Paula.

1055
01:11:47,127 --> 01:11:49,322
<i>You should never tread on</i>

1056
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,446
<i>your neighbour's feelings,</i>

1057
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:57,206
<i>because the wind</i>
<i>will blow away</i>

1058
01:11:58,487 --> 01:12:00,796
<i>that sort of behaviour.</i>

1059
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:04,567
<i>What has your life been,</i>
<i>Adolfo?</i>

1060
01:12:05,407 --> 01:12:08,205
<i>Without principles,</i>
<i>without decency,</i>

1061
01:12:10,407 --> 01:12:13,604
<i>with no respect for love,</i>

1062
01:12:14,327 --> 01:12:17,763
<i>it's a lost battle.</i>

1063
01:12:19,087 --> 01:12:20,839
<i>Guantanamera,</i>

1064
01:12:22,367 --> 01:12:24,801
<i>guajira guantanamera,</i>

1065
01:12:27,207 --> 01:12:29,323
<i>guantanamera,</i>

1066
01:12:32,127 --> 01:12:34,322
- The body for Cardenas is yours.
- No.

1067
01:12:34,687 --> 01:12:37,565
I said this was madness from
the start, and no one listened.

1068
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:41,203
Now the facts have proved me right.
In no time at all,

1069
01:12:41,367 --> 01:12:43,801
three funerals have
passed through here,

1070
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:46,640
one for Cienfuegos,
another for Aguada de Pasajeros,

1071
01:12:46,807 --> 01:12:50,083
and the third for Sancti Spíritus.
The corpse bound for Cárdenas

1072
01:12:50,527 --> 01:12:51,562
is all yours!

1073
01:12:51,727 --> 01:12:55,037
I pioneered this operation,
and I do the calculations.

1074
01:12:55,207 --> 01:12:56,799
My funeral gets priority.

1075
01:12:56,967 --> 01:12:58,605
Well, whether you like it or not,

1076
01:12:58,767 --> 01:12:59,756
I can't separate the funerals

1077
01:12:59,927 --> 01:13:01,280
because I've only got
one hearse left.

1078
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:04,598
This isn't over yet! I'm taking it
up with the pertinent authorities.

1079
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,803
Take it to the top,
if you like.

1080
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:09,117
I'm as happy with a funeral
as a homage.

1081
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:16,156
You say he'd never had
a sick day in his life?

1082
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:18,119
The poor thing was full of life.

1083
01:13:18,887 --> 01:13:20,878
He liked walking,

1084
01:13:21,247 --> 01:13:23,715
horse riding, climbing hills...

1085
01:13:24,727 --> 01:13:26,479
He didn't want to die and...

1086
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:29,243
just look...

1087
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,324
- How are you?
- So, so...

1088
01:13:33,407 --> 01:13:36,205
The day of his 107th birthday,

1089
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:39,475
the photographer asked him
to step back from the camera,

1090
01:13:39,647 --> 01:13:41,399
to get a better photo.

1091
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:44,161
A bit further back, a bit further...

1092
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,959
But he didn't know he was
on the edge of a precipice.

1093
01:13:50,887 --> 01:13:52,764
It's my first visit to Santa Clara.

1094
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:56,845
- I've never visited anywhere.
- Oh, Cándido!

1095
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:58,483
Look!

1096
01:14:00,247 --> 01:14:02,681
Just like Yoyita's dress.
Remember?

1097
01:14:02,847 --> 01:14:04,644
Yes, we bought it together.

1098
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:05,957
Yes.

1099
01:14:06,447 --> 01:14:08,165
Well, it would look lovely on you.

1100
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,199
- Hi, Tony.
- Hello.

1101
01:14:14,647 --> 01:14:15,682
Do you sell soft drinks?

1102
01:14:16,647 --> 01:14:18,638
We've only got tea and rum.

1103
01:14:18,927 --> 01:14:20,440
- Would you like a tea, Cándido?
- Okay...

1104
01:14:20,607 --> 01:14:21,517
Two teas.

1105
01:14:58,807 --> 01:15:00,923
Just a minute, I'll be right back.

1106
01:15:06,287 --> 01:15:07,436
Listen, friend,

1107
01:15:07,607 --> 01:15:10,519
you can't fit two coffins in this
hearse without damaging them.

1108
01:15:11,647 --> 01:15:13,922
We'll have to wait for
the hearse from Camagüey.

1109
01:15:14,527 --> 01:15:15,676
How long will that take?

1110
01:15:15,847 --> 01:15:17,075
An hour, an hour and a half.

1111
01:15:17,247 --> 01:15:18,805
No way. We're in a real hurry.

1112
01:15:19,007 --> 01:15:21,237
Let's try a little harder,
push a bit harder.

1113
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:24,961
A bit more... push, push!

1114
01:15:25,127 --> 01:15:28,324
It's coming! That's got it!

1115
01:15:30,127 --> 01:15:30,684
There!

1116
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:20,723
Gina!

1117
01:16:25,367 --> 01:16:27,437
You look like a whore
with your hair loose.

1118
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,525
I don't trust that old man.
You're to stop talking to him.

1119
01:16:32,687 --> 01:16:35,326
And you can change
that dress right now!

1120
01:16:35,527 --> 01:16:36,926
Listen when I'm talking!

1121
01:16:37,647 --> 01:16:39,000
Keep out of it, old man.

1122
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:39,997
Who do you think you are?

1123
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:42,603
Stop!

1124
01:16:47,887 --> 01:16:49,878
- Let her go, dammit!
- What the...!

1125
01:17:01,847 --> 01:17:03,121
Come on, mate.

1126
01:17:09,727 --> 01:17:11,445
I told you,
I'm tired of telling you...

1127
01:17:11,607 --> 01:17:13,199
You enjoy looking for trouble.

1128
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:55,358
<i>In the beginning</i>

1129
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:58,880
<i>Olofin made man and woman</i>

1130
01:17:59,767 --> 01:18:01,120
<i>and gave them life.</i>

1131
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:04,765
<i>Olofin made life,</i>

1132
01:18:05,887 --> 01:18:08,355
<i>but he forgot to make death.</i>

1133
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:15,999
<i>The years passed</i>
<i>and the men and women</i>

1134
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:19,842
<i>got older and older,</i>
<i>but they did not die.</i>

1135
01:18:21,247 --> 01:18:24,956
<i>The Earth filled up with people</i>
<i>who were thousands of years old,</i>

1136
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:29,201
<i>and who still ruled according</i>
<i>to their ancient laws.</i>

1137
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:33,722
<i>The young people</i>
<i>clamoured such that</i>

1138
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:36,437
<i>one day their cries</i>

1139
01:18:36,727 --> 01:18:37,842
<i>reached the ears</i>

1140
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:38,996
<i>of Olofin.</i>

1141
01:18:39,607 --> 01:18:43,725
<i>Olofin saw that the world</i>
<i>was not as good as he had</i>

1142
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:44,757
<i>planned.</i>

1143
01:18:45,207 --> 01:18:46,276
<i>He felt</i>

1144
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:50,203
<i>that he also was</i>
<i>too old and tired</i>

1145
01:18:51,247 --> 01:18:52,965
<i>to begin again</i>

1146
01:18:53,407 --> 01:18:55,716
<i>what had turned out so badly.</i>

1147
01:18:57,407 --> 01:18:59,716
<i>So Olofin called lkú</i>

1148
01:19:00,047 --> 01:19:02,322
<i>to take care of the matter.</i>

1149
01:19:05,447 --> 01:19:06,596
<i>And lkú saw</i>

1150
01:19:06,807 --> 01:19:09,275
<i>that it was time to put</i>
<i>an end to the era</i>

1151
01:19:10,407 --> 01:19:11,886
<i>in which people did not die.</i>

1152
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:17,038
<i>So lkú caused it to rain</i>
<i>upon the earth for 30 days</i>

1153
01:19:17,207 --> 01:19:19,641
<i>and 30 nights without end,</i>

1154
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:22,566
<i>and all was covered</i>

1155
01:19:22,727 --> 01:19:24,001
<i>with water.</i>

1156
01:19:26,047 --> 01:19:26,718
<i>Only</i>

1157
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:31,039
<i>the children and the young were</i>
<i>able to climb the giant trees</i>

1158
01:19:32,127 --> 01:19:34,641
<i>and climb the highest mountains.</i>

1159
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:38,319
<i>The whole Earth became</i>

1160
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:41,916
<i>a huge river with no banks.</i>

1161
01:19:46,087 --> 01:19:50,239
<i>The young people then saw</i>
<i>that the Earth was cleaner</i>

1162
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:52,686
<i>and more beautiful,</i>

1163
01:19:54,047 --> 01:19:56,515
<i>and ran to give thanks to lkú</i>

1164
01:19:57,607 --> 01:19:59,086
<i>for putting and end</i>

1165
01:20:00,327 --> 01:20:01,999
<i>to immortality.</i>

1166
01:21:57,007 --> 01:21:58,440
They told me the one
on the right.

1167
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:01,918
- That one has to go to Havana.
- No, this is the right one.

1168
01:22:02,087 --> 01:22:03,805
The one on the right
is this one, old man.

1169
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,924
We're not going to spend
all day here arguing.

1170
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:07,918
One has a blue ribbon attached.

1171
01:22:08,087 --> 01:22:08,917
It's the other one.

1172
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:12,843
This one?

1173
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:14,723
Exactly.

1174
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:44,600
Excuse me, miss.

1175
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:46,919
When's the next bus to Havana?

1176
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,317
Ticket sales are suspended
until tomorrow.

1177
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:52,763
Thank you.

1178
01:23:26,087 --> 01:23:28,123
Hello, Adolfo.
How was the journey?

1179
01:23:29,207 --> 01:23:31,084
Look, this is the car.

1180
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:32,801
This is your driver.

1181
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:36,916
I'll send you some men right away
to help with the changeover.

1182
01:23:37,487 --> 01:23:40,285
I've a terrible headache.
Do you have an aspirin?

1183
01:23:40,447 --> 01:23:42,836
Certainly, madam.
Follow me to the office.

1184
01:23:43,047 --> 01:23:44,196
Come on, Adolfo.

1185
01:23:44,607 --> 01:23:47,804
I know how uncomfortable these
journeys can be.

1186
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:56,120
Brother, I need a favour.

1187
01:23:56,287 --> 01:23:58,926
I've come from the East and
I've got the boot full of stuff.

1188
01:24:01,807 --> 01:24:02,956
I tell you, madam,

1189
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:06,798
they'll have to give your husband
a medal when he gets to Havana.

1190
01:24:12,407 --> 01:24:13,203
Gina!

1191
01:24:18,367 --> 01:24:20,244
Forgive me, I didn't know
what I was doing.

1192
01:24:21,887 --> 01:24:23,002
Don't be like this,

1193
01:24:23,447 --> 01:24:24,926
not now when I need you most.

1194
01:24:25,967 --> 01:24:28,162
There are 60 miles left
to Havana.

1195
01:24:28,847 --> 01:24:30,166
Change that dress.

1196
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:33,559
Back in Guantánamo, everything
will be just as it was.

1197
01:24:33,967 --> 01:24:37,004
Nothing will be the same now.
I know you too well.

1198
01:24:39,087 --> 01:24:41,043
And I'm tired of not thinking.

1199
01:24:41,487 --> 01:24:43,876
If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
Everyone makes mistakes.

1200
01:24:44,087 --> 01:24:48,000
That radio show José Luis keeps
offering me, I'm going to accept.

1201
01:24:50,767 --> 01:24:52,120
A radio programme?

1202
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:54,600
On youth guidance?

1203
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:57,920
You weren't even capable of bringing
up your own bloody daughter.

1204
01:24:58,087 --> 01:25:01,762
I'm fed up of your blaming me
for Niurka's going to Miami!

1205
01:25:01,927 --> 01:25:04,282
Who was it who let her
hang around with

1206
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:07,405
those hairy pseudo-intellectuals
and listen to their songs?

1207
01:25:07,807 --> 01:25:10,401
Who let her read magazines about
"perestroika" and all that shit?

1208
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:11,397
Oh, Adolfo!

1209
01:25:12,367 --> 01:25:14,039
Remember the things
she came out with?

1210
01:25:15,127 --> 01:25:17,243
For the first time I had to
raise my hand to her.

1211
01:25:17,527 --> 01:25:18,880
My own daughter!

1212
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:22,676
Of course she bloody left,
after you poisoned her mind!

1213
01:25:22,847 --> 01:25:25,839
Niurka didn't leave
because of her friends,

1214
01:25:26,007 --> 01:25:28,123
or the songs,
or what she read.

1215
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:30,881
She left because she had to
do all those things in secret.

1216
01:25:31,047 --> 01:25:33,038
- And she was fed up of that!
- No!

1217
01:25:33,487 --> 01:25:37,400
Wait! I let you have your say,
now it's my turn.

1218
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:39,199
Yes, you're right.

1219
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:41,523
Who am I to to give
guidance to anyone?

1220
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:44,520
If I take on that programme,
as I want to,

1221
01:25:44,687 --> 01:25:46,996
it's not to tell anyone
what to think.

1222
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:50,756
Far be it from me to give
anyone instructions!

1223
01:25:50,927 --> 01:25:52,565
You don't know me at all.

1224
01:25:56,967 --> 01:25:59,879
As for the dress,
I'm not changing it.

1225
01:26:04,447 --> 01:26:05,402
It's there in the back.

1226
01:26:13,047 --> 01:26:14,116
Cover it with the flowers.

1227
01:26:20,607 --> 01:26:23,041
Shit! This is going to be
a problem.

1228
01:26:23,447 --> 01:26:24,596
Put it here,

1229
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:27,156
and if it lifts its head,
just push it down again.

1230
01:26:29,007 --> 01:26:29,598
Here.

1231
01:26:30,087 --> 01:26:30,997
A gift.

1232
01:27:15,327 --> 01:27:16,362
Come on, old timer.

1233
01:27:33,327 --> 01:27:36,080
So they dropped you like a hot
potato in the middle of the road?

1234
01:27:36,247 --> 01:27:37,043
No.

1235
01:27:37,207 --> 01:27:40,916
I left of my own accord,
to get away from that animal.

1236
01:27:41,647 --> 01:27:43,603
It seems some people
put up with him very well.

1237
01:27:46,847 --> 01:27:48,644
Listen, old man.
I need a favour.

1238
01:27:49,087 --> 01:27:50,236
When you see Gina,

1239
01:27:51,247 --> 01:27:52,600
tell her I want her

1240
01:27:54,447 --> 01:27:55,516
to forgive me.

1241
01:27:58,367 --> 01:28:01,086
I get into all sorts of trouble
for not minding my own business.

1242
01:28:01,927 --> 01:28:04,236
Why not ask her yourself, son?

1243
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:05,841
See what she says.

1244
01:28:06,567 --> 01:28:09,081
I hope I never bump into
that woman again.

1245
01:28:30,687 --> 01:28:33,121
The name's Ramón.
Just ask for me at work.

1246
01:28:33,287 --> 01:28:34,766
Help him down, Mariano.

1247
01:28:35,447 --> 01:28:36,436
Be careful, there.

1248
01:28:45,407 --> 01:28:46,442
Well, son...

1249
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:49,716
Take care.

1250
01:28:59,527 --> 01:29:00,562
Cándido!

1251
01:29:06,927 --> 01:29:09,077
I'll give you a written
report tomorrow.

1252
01:29:09,607 --> 01:29:12,917
But I can tell you now, we saved
no less than sixty litres of petrol

1253
01:29:13,407 --> 01:29:15,318
and two days expenses in cash.

1254
01:29:15,607 --> 01:29:17,325
Any trouble on the way?

1255
01:29:17,487 --> 01:29:19,682
There are always problems,
but there are always solutions, too.

1256
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:22,799
In Sancti Spíritus I put the two
coffins for Cárdenas together.

1257
01:29:22,967 --> 01:29:23,922
Here's the order.

1258
01:29:32,047 --> 01:29:33,002
Here it is.

1259
01:30:09,247 --> 01:30:10,077
Shit!

1260
01:30:19,567 --> 01:30:20,716
What's wrong?

1261
01:30:21,367 --> 01:30:22,641
Cándido, please...

1262
01:31:15,207 --> 01:31:16,640
- The ladder.
- Yes.

1263
01:31:41,247 --> 01:31:42,475
Dear friends,

1264
01:31:43,487 --> 01:31:45,205
families of the deceased.

1265
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:48,679
On this morning we are united
by a great sorrow.

1266
01:31:49,487 --> 01:31:52,797
Two very dear people
are no longer with us.

1267
01:31:53,287 --> 01:31:55,403
Out of love, and only love,

1268
01:31:55,567 --> 01:31:58,035
they have crossed
the threshold of silence

1269
01:31:58,207 --> 01:32:00,004
which leads us to immortality.

1270
01:32:01,647 --> 01:32:04,719
We are here today to say farewell
to two unforgettable people,

1271
01:32:05,367 --> 01:32:08,086
two lovers who,
across time and space,

1272
01:32:08,247 --> 01:32:10,397
kept their hearts united.

1273
01:32:10,887 --> 01:32:13,117
Two beings, consecrated to love,

1274
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:15,201
Aunt Yoyita,

1275
01:32:15,727 --> 01:32:18,400
as her nearest and dearest
affectionately called her,

1276
01:32:18,967 --> 01:32:21,765
and that fine fellow, Cándido,
the generous musician

1277
01:32:21,927 --> 01:32:24,043
who often cheered our Sundays

1278
01:32:24,207 --> 01:32:25,435
from the bandstand

1279
01:32:25,607 --> 01:32:27,563
in our distant hometown,
Guantánamo.

1280
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:30,362
They lived the most sublime
moments of love.

1281
01:32:30,807 --> 01:32:32,638
For years, only

1282
01:32:32,807 --> 01:32:35,719
their memory kept alive
the flame of that love...

1283
01:32:36,007 --> 01:32:39,044
A love which grew
in their hearts,

1284
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:41,803
until, suddenly, both hearts

1285
01:32:41,967 --> 01:32:45,004
burst as one
in a flood of happiness,

1286
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:47,404
joy and immaculate

1287
01:32:47,567 --> 01:32:48,477
glory.

1288
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:52,242
In that one moment they
touched the bounds of eternity.

1289
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:56,437
Death unites them today
in an imperishable embrace.

1290
01:32:57,007 --> 01:32:58,725
Those who die of love

1291
01:32:58,927 --> 01:33:01,760
bequeath a lesson,
at their passing,

1292
01:33:02,687 --> 01:33:05,759
to those of us who remain,
disconsolate and somewhat Ionelier

1293
01:33:06,207 --> 01:33:07,879
on this side of the threshold.

1294
01:33:08,407 --> 01:33:10,284
That lesson, my friends,

1295
01:33:10,607 --> 01:33:12,996
teaches us that love
is the salt of life.

1296
01:33:13,567 --> 01:33:16,764
It is our task to follow

1297
01:33:16,927 --> 01:33:19,566
the path which they trod,

1298
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:22,685
hand in hand like two lovers

1299
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,803
in search of eternal bliss.

1300
01:33:27,287 --> 01:33:29,084
Hey, listen!

1301
01:33:29,847 --> 01:33:30,836
Don't go!

1302
01:33:31,287 --> 01:33:33,926
Wait! I haven't finished my speech.

1303
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:35,926
Help!

1304
01:33:36,807 --> 01:33:38,320
Don't leave me here alone!

1305
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:41,277
Help!

1306
01:33:42,167 --> 01:33:42,804
The ladder!

1307
01:33:43,487 --> 01:33:44,806
Bring me the ladder!
