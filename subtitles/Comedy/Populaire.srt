ENGLISH TRANSLATION: ASIFAKHEIR

4
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,110
<i>The key to being a good
secretary is discretion.</i>

5
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,860
You must be indispensible,
but without being pushy.

6
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,160
An employer must see you're
capable, right off the bat.

7
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,020
Wearing glasses is essential.

8
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,820
- But I don't have vision problems.
- So ?

9
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,920
Neither do I.

10
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,390
I wear non-prescription.

11
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,790
Glasses give the appearence of being
at once serious and unobtrusive.

12
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,570
As for the rest, you've got it all.

13
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,070
Natural make up,

14
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,470
a sober coiffure that stays in place,
moderate use of perfume.

15
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,860
A mild soap is also very good
if you don't have perfume.

16
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,260
- It's all in your bearing.
- And your forbearance!

17
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,190
So, what's he like?

18
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,030
Really not bad.

19
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,430
What's your name again, my dear?

20
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,260
Rose Pamphyle, with a "Y".
I'm from Saint-Fraimbault.

21
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,090
What brings you here,
Rose Pamphyle-with-a-"Y"?

22
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,480
Saint-Fraimbault is not next door.

23
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,240
So far I've worked for
my father, in his drug store.

24
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,890
- It's the number one store in the village.
- It's important to be number one.

25
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,010
I've done enough time in sales.

26
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,890
Opportunities are are back home.

27
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,530
Specially if you want to be a secretary.

28
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,600
All the girls want to be secretaries.
It's the latest fad.

29
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,640
To be a secretary,
is to be modern.

30
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,710
To meet lots of people, tour the world,
and work for great men.

31
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,650
If you worked for me you
would only get to tour Lisieux.

32
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,080
Pretty good for starters.

33
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,810
Reality is much less chic
than what the papers say.

34
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,270
Not all bosses have incredible adventures
and neither do their secretaries.

35
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,760
- You may as well go back home.
- I need this job Mr. Echard.

36
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,420
The only thing I can do well is type.

37
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,920
Typing is the minimum
requirement for a secretary.

38
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,300
It's not against the law
to use ten fingers.

39
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,110
So?

40
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,130
How did it go?

41
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,700
The looked at me like I was dressed
for a costume ball, Francoise.

42
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,020
I bet you were the prettiest one.

43
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,760
They took me on!

44
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,930
They hired me!

45
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,900
Just for one week. To try me out.

46
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,010
Secretary!

47
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,910
Do you realize what this...?!

48
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,510
- When do you start?
- Tomorrow.

49
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,030
Tomorrow we make your
engagement official.

50
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,670
Help me label this stuff before you leave.

51
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,430
Sure, Mr. Jean.

52
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,280
I won't marry Maurice, papa.

53
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,430
The best catch in town,
and she's having none of it.

54
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,470
Maurice can make her happy,
I just don't get it.

55
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,190
Well, it's just to tell you
the estimate is done ...

56
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,040
the estimate and...

57
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,420
Excuse me.

58
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,160
Excuse me, Mr Echard,

59
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,930
I don't know if I should ask this,
but do you think you could
avoid smoking at work?

60
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,950
There'd have to be a law
forbidding me, my dear.

61
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,450
This machine was made for a woman

62
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,150
not for an elefant.

63
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,810
I was saying,
I've already done the estimate

64
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,280
We have to face the obvious,
Bob, we have a problem.

65
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,700
You French see problems everywhere.

66
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,460
Make everything climb to the sky.

67
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,600
We didn' rebuild half the city
after the war to eventually
replace it with New York.

68
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,430
- People need their landmarks.
-<i> The sky's my limit.</i>

69
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,750
Your wheels are bigger than
your office. When are you
going to move out of there?

70
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,040
You don't think I'll leave you
in peace so easily, Echard.

71
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,300
My Buick and you,
are all I need to be happy.

72
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,710
I'll meet you there,
Rose is running late.

73
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,260
Ah, your new recruit?

74
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,300
<i>- Listen.</i>
- What is she like?

75
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,080
- She's only been here 3 days.
- Oh, yeah.

76
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,040
Her ...?

77
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,010
I'm sure you didn't hire her
for her professional qualities.

78
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,030
<i># Joyeux anniversaire #</i>

79
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,500
<i># Joyeux anniversaire #</i>

80
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,650
<i># Happy birthday to you, Louis #</i>

81
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,030
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

82
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,040
Every year we have a surprise
party, and what's worse is,
every year you're surprised.

83
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,920
- Bravo!
- Joe, Simone, come here!

84
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,040
Bravo, you were perfect.

85
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,060
What about me, don't I get
encouragement from the jury?

86
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,000
You already know Marie,
you're perfect. I've been telling
you since primary school!

87
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,180
Wait!

88
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,230
Make a wish.

89
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,520
I already have all I need.

90
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,870
Papa, tell us again
how you and mama met.

91
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,440
You know that story by heart.

92
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,510
When I came from America
to liberate France...

93
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,430
You, and thousands of other soldiers.

94
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,410
First, the Marines took
the Normandy beaches.

95
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,220
- Which they couldn't do
without our help.
- <i>Anyway...</i>

96
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,950
I had to land behind enemy lines.

97
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,330
But, the barn he crashed into was your...?

98
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,690
- Grampa's!

99
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,790
Perhaps, but it was me...

100
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,320
who married your mother.

101
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,680
She was the prettiest girl around.

102
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,390
And still is.

103
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,780
Echard and Sons Agency!

104
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,670
Absolutely, Sir.

105
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,480
Mr. Echard sees clients
in the mornings.

106
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,900
Thursday, 10 o'clock?

107
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,420
Yes. You are Mr...?

108
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,470
...Constant.

109
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,420
Certainly.

110
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,560
Of course.

111
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,420
<i>Mr. Constant Thursday, 10:.</i>

112
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,210
Certainly!

113
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,330
I've made a note.

114
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,330
Good day, Mr Constant.

115
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,600
It's not a "D", but a "T" on the end.

116
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,330
I don't know if that's legible.

117
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,140
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Blaiseau!

118
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,440
May I present Miss Pamphyle,
my new secretary.

119
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,060
- Miss.
- If you'll follow me.

120
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,380
It won't be necessary,
we won't be long.

121
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,480
No problem with your account,
I hope.

122
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
No, you must accept this.

123
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,240
1949! No, I couldn't.

124
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,240
Don't be a meathead, I've known
you since you were this high.

125
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,280
A lady as young as yourself
could not have known me
when I was that high.

126
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,640
Shall I see you out?

127
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,660
Cigarette?

128
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,740
Rose...

129
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,600
I've watched you for a week now.

130
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,890
I'm not too sure you're happy here.

131
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,780
I bought a stenography manual
yesterday, Mr Echard.

132
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,600
- Forget it, it's a no go.
- I'll get the hang of it. You'll see...

133
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,810
You'll be wasting your time.

134
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,740
Not at all!

135
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,180
I've mastered
telephone technique... sort of.

136
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,540
I just doubt that your
future is here with me.

137
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,340
Unless...

138
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,180
you agree to do a little something.

139
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,020
Anything you want.

140
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,080
It's been on my mind
since I first saw you.

141
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,970
It doesn't concern work
strictly speaking,

142
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,990
but I'm sure it'll
make you happy, my dear.

143
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,890
And me too.

144
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,370
Rose!

145
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,800
You misunderstood me!

146
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,600
It's YOU who misunderstood ME,

147
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,120
if you think it's so easy
to get me in bed.

148
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,620
Mrs. Darnien...

149
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,930
You're crackers !

150
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,820
I'd have to be an idiot
to make advances to you !

151
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,200
You think you're so clever
in your fancy clothes?

152
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,050
You leave me cold, Mr. Echard.

153
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,220
- The feeling's mutual.
- Suits me !

154
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,610
Here's where I want you,
not in my bed.

155
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,570
REGIONAL
SPEED TYPING CHAMPIONSHIP

156
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,080
Is this really all you want
me to do, to keep my job?

157
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,670
Participate in a contest?

158
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,000
Not participate...

159
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,030
win.

160
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,030
I thought this was
a friendly match.

161
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,500
No such thing as FRIENDLY,
to a real athlete, Taylor.

162
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,470
Athlete? Where?
I see an insurance salesman.

163
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,850
You see, before you, the trainer
of the next Champion of Lower Normady

164
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,760
in Speed Typing.

165
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,070
Echard, when you hire a secretary,

166
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,980
you get to know her, and you marry her.
You don't enter her in contests

167
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,800
With no training and
already she goes like bazes.

168
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,630
- I can't pass up such a gift.
- Sleep with her.

169
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,860
It'll do her more good
than a medal.

170
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,230
A trainer doesn't sleep
with his athlete, Taylor.

171
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,710
It guarantees under-performance.

172
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,180
She isn't cut out for
high level competition.

173
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,570
Wanna bet?

174
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,140
<i>Alright</i>, you're on.

175
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,680
I'll beat you this time.

176
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,200
Rose is a little animal --
wild and skittish.

177
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,080
All she needs to burst forth
is someone to take care of her.

178
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,540
Kindness will be
your undoing, Echard.

179
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,120
In round one she'll have to
type at least 360 strokes a minute.

180
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,150
The whole competition takes
as much effort as running 5Km.

181
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,010
Punching keys,
I could do that too !

182
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,860
- Oh, yeah?
Go tell the jury.
- Jury?

183
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,040
Every mis-stroke counts,
whether inverted or omitted.
For every extra word...

184
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,340
every line spacing error,
they deduct 100 strokes.

185
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,520
Only 16 qualify in 10 minute rounds,
then 8, then 4...

186
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,660
The last two face off
for 5 minutes.

187
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,780
I'd like to see YOU do that !

188
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,520
- They're sensational!
- "They're sensational!"

189
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,260
Go, Paulette,
type faster than your shadow!

190
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,090
Pau-lette Marti-no!
Queen of the steno!

191
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,250
The national title's up for grabs
after the regional.

192
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,080
What's the world record?

193
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,790
- 512 strokes a minute.
- 512 strokes a minute.

194
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,200
- Held by an American.
- Why didn't you say so!

195
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,260
She's lousy at everything, but

196
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,810
when she types, she's fast,
powerful, focused. You'll see.

197
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,730
Ladies, please,

198
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,520
May I have your attention.

199
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,870
Everybody in position.

200
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,300
Attention! Hands above your keyboards.

201
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,870
358 strokes! Two goddamn characters,
and we'd have qualified.

202
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,590
If you typed with 10 fingers like them,
it could have been possible.

203
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,960
<i>Don't worry !</i>

204
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,530
This is not a sport for clumsy girls.

205
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,280
Stop. Stop, please.
I'll continue on foot.

206
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,580
You should have got angry at
the typewriter. Now, it's too late.

207
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,740
I could have opened it by myself.

208
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,190
I may be clumsy, but I'm not infirm!

209
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,560
Never enter her in a
sharpshooting contest.

210
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,080
We'd all end up dead.

211
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,710
You always reek of tobacco,
Miss Pamphyle.

212
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,160
No doubt, you feel you're above
the rules of our establishment?

213
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,140
This is a boarding house
for serious young ladies!

214
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,610
Decidedly...
I've upset you, my dear.

215
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,090
Stop calling me "my dear",
I have a name like everybody.

216
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,790
One set-back isn't necessarily
a bad thing.

217
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,460
For you.

218
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,950
Tomorrow you'll find another
racehorse for a pastime.

219
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,990
I'll go back to
Saint-Hicksville-on-the-Sea,

220
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and marry the son
of a gas station attendant.

221
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,340
The whole village will laugh at me
for being unable to keep a job for a week.

222
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,370
I've always been a laughing stock.

223
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,950
No one's forcing you to go
back to Saint-Hicksville-on-the...

224
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,580
...Saint-Fraimbault.

225
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,640
I might have that choice
if I were a man.

226
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,080
I'm not good at anything.

227
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,620
Maybe you're only good at typing.

228
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,760
Being good at one thing,
in this world, is enough.

229
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,980
Enough to look like a dope.

230
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,910
I'd like you to participate
in the next competition.

231
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,010
I'd like YOU to leave me alone.

232
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,130
I'll train you.
I'll take care of everything.

233
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,590
I'll put you up at my house.

234
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,590
- With you?
- Yeah.

235
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,650
It would be...

236
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,710
more...

237
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,580
practical.

238
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,970
And...

239
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,970
You...

240
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,720
You'd hire me for good if I accept.

241
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,840
You were a horrible secretary.

242
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,310
<i>Your office work will be like extra training.</i>

243
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,980
<i>You'll open in the mornings and I'll close up.
You'll go to work by bicycle.</i>

244
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,630
<i>I'll come by car a little later,</i>

245
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,200
<i>same thing at the end of the day.</i>

246
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,000
<i>People mustn't know you live with me.
They'll gossip</i>

247
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,040
Come on.

248
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,580
Come on.

249
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,870
Holy cow !

250
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,500
It's like being in "Gone With the Wind"!

251
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,700
My father had this built.

252
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,750
Odd that you have the same
tastes as your father.

253
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,770
No time to fix it up to suit
my style, that's all.

254
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,890
We'll train here every
evening and week-ends.

255
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,780
I don't expect you to lug it to work
every morning. I'll buy another.

256
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,870
However...

257
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,620
it wouldn't hurt
to work on your biceps.

258
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,100
Come, I'll show you your room.

259
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,280
Never mind those old trinkets.

260
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,700
You must have been some athlete !

261
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,760
I didn't have the stuff
of champions.

262
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,790
Perhaps.

263
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,900
But you were sporty.

264
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,920
If you need me,

265
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,810
my room's upstairs,
at the end of the hall.

266
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,290
Don't worry I won't jump you.

267
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,550
It's a very old house,

268
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,700
the stairs creak at every step,

269
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,160
you'd hear me coming
from miles away.

270
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,290
I want you to type one book
a month until the competition,

271
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,140
twelve in all.

272
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,680
"Literary Dactylography",

273
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,840
will help you to grasp
difficult constructions,

274
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,980
and precise styles,

275
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,970
you'll be able to anticipate
the ends of phrases

276
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,460
from any text, in no time.

277
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,390
No need to understand everything.

278
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,300
It's very simple.

279
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,060
Each finger corresponds to one colour;

280
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,290
and each colour to a group of letters.

281
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,470
Left middle finger, colored yellow,

282
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,730
types the apostrophe, and letters E, D, C.

283
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,560
Right ring finger, colored red,

284
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,920
types O, L, and the colon.

285
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,520
I can read !

286
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,990
I can understand everything.

287
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,850
Even complicated phrases.

288
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,400
You'll grasp them more easily
if you fan them out, Rose.

289
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,780
Don't forget to double them up.

290
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,270
You can pull them from the roller
faster, without tearing.

291
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,700
No need to watch over me,
I'm a big girl.

292
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,960
There are buses leaving for
Saint-Fraimbault every day.

293
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,730
Mister Echard?

294
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,190
<i>Yes, my dear?</i>

295
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,480
I've destroyed
Mrs. Maurelle's policy...

296
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,180
and I think I killed the shredder.

297
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,020
<i>Handle it yourself,
you're a big girl.</i>

298
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,200
Shit !

299
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,780
You alright?

300
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,600
Yes, I think so.

301
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,740
Does this hurt?

302
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,460
If I press here,

303
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,290
feel anything? If I press there...

304
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,330
Why not insure my fingers,
while you're at it?

305
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,540
Come on, I'll take you.

306
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,330
If Flaubert took as long as you
to write "Madame Bovary"

307
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,230
he'd have died before she did.

308
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,510
Do you think demoralizing me
will get you better results?

309
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,900
You're still too touchy
to win anything.

310
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,130
The story behind this bottle involves
a painter and an old farmer.

311
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,830
In 1950, I was estimating
storm damage at a little farm.

312
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,200
You want me to practise or not?

313
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,040
The farm was in a bad state.

314
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,060
A tree had fallen
right on the chicken coop,

315
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,810
and made a big hole in the roof.

316
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,780
Mr Echard, I can't type
if you speak to me.

317
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,110
You must be able to
remain focused

318
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,370
no matter what is going on
around you.

319
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,730
To plug the hole,
Picard, the farmer...

320
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,980
had used an old painting.

321
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,450
I removed it,

322
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,510
dried it,

323
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,380
and guess what I uncovered?

324
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,190
A Van Gogh!

325
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,310
When I showed the painting to Picard,

326
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,960
he said he got it from his grandmother,

327
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,020
that he'd never heard of this Mr Van Gogh,

328
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,520
and all he was interested in was,

329
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,450
if the insurance would cover the damage.

330
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,130
I convinced Picard to
put the painting up for auction,

331
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,460
now he's as rich as Croesus,

332
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,670
and has furnished my cellar
with this eccellent cru from 1934.

333
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,260
Your clients always
offer you wine, it seems.

334
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,370
It's a miracle you're not an alcoholic.

335
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,890
Nobody said the training was finished.

336
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,970
No disrespect, Mr Echard,
but you're stupid.

337
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,590
I know.

338
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,310
I should have kept the painting.

339
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,490
You're stupid to play the tough guy with me,

340
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,830
since you're the kindest person I know.

341
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,570
You don't know many people.

342
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,160
Latest fashion in Paris.
- Ah!

343
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,840
Au revoir.

344
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,860
Time's up!

345
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,690
Next!

346
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,990
Mademoiselle?

347
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,720
If you're looking for the matching panties,

348
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,050
- I'm wearing them.
- No, it's not at all...

349
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,590
Rose, you left this in the machine and...

350
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,720
Keep it, if you like it so much.

351
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,420
Thanks, but I have a whole collection.

352
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,350
Add that to your collection.

353
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,820
Now I understand why
I can't find any files

354
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,100
since you've been working for me.

355
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,470
I was just in the middle of
rearranging.

356
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,030
I'd be finished
if I didn't have to spend

357
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,290
all my evenings
with "Madame Bovary".

358
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,480
Who do you think is the most beautiful?

359
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,030
They're stars...

360
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,310
They wouldn't be interested
in an insurance man.

361
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,690
Just pretend.

362
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,130
I'm sure you like curvaceous women,

363
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,240
like everybody.

364
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,580
The others must seem too
classic, too dated.

365
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,520
My type is more like, that one.
What film's she been in?

366
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,560
Nothing, it's my mother.

367
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,170
She's very beautiful.

368
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,830
I know I don't resemble her at all.
I took after my father.

369
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,400
If he weren't so narrow-minded,
we'd be the best friends in the world.

370
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,550
Men and women are very
different creatures, that's all!

371
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,390
Rose!

372
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,730
Rose?

373
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,480
I can't do it!

374
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,760
My fingers hurt!

375
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,460
My back hurts
I ache everywhere...

376
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,940
Are you completely mad?
You gave me a fright!

377
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,560
A man who cooks!
Now that's modern!

378
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,250
Type.

379
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,020
New paragraph.

380
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,150
If you sit up straight,
you won't ache anymore.

381
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,880
Not supple enough,

382
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,760
that's your problem...

383
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,080
Not at all, I'm very supple.

384
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,860
- Extremely supple, even!
- Oh yeah?

385
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,130
Yellow, then red, then green...

386
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,980
You think I'm really going to
give her piano lessons?

387
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,260
I've already got plenty to do,
between the children and the house!

388
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,420
It'd just be for a few months...

389
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,260
Let's go!

390
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,060
Stay and eat,
Bob won't be long.

391
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,710
Rose needs to practise.

392
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,280
It's been a pleasure to meet you.

393
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,340
Kids, do you want to see
a magic trick?

394
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Yeah Louis!

395
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,170
Yes, please Louis!

396
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,070
Keep your eye on the knife!

397
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,650
Louis don't!

398
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,090
Stop it!

399
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,170
I'll stop only...

400
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,950
if you promise to give her lessons!

401
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,060
It's no big deal if I don't learn
to play the piano Mr Echard!

402
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,840
Stop it, you'll cut off a finger!

403
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,590
Promise!

404
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,640
You traumatized
those poor kids

405
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,050
You could 'thank' me.

406
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,910
For doubling my hours of training
with piano lessons?

407
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,110
Thanks a lot!

408
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,440
Anyway, Mrs. Taylor is very beautiful.

409
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,830
Is she your mistress?

410
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,550
Rose, she's my best friend's wife!

411
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,650
You've known her longer than him!

412
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,120
Yes, you're right.

413
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,440
Marie and me, we had a liaison.

414
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,040
When we were five!

415
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,840
You looked at her like she
was your mistress.

416
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,240
Bind it tighter
and stop spouting nonsesnse!

417
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,100
I don't want to hurt you.

418
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,900
Alright by me.

419
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,430
It seems you're a man...

420
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,270
who knows what it really means to suffer?

421
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,050
You've been to war, after all.

422
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,740
I may have suffered,
but not as much as others.

423
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,490
Not as much as who?

424
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,340
Aren't you fed up
asking me questions?

425
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,450
Not a chance, considering
the length of your answers!

426
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,200
You want me to trust you but
you're unable to do the same.

427
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,090
In '43 I led a small
Resistance group,

428
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,210
Incredibile guys!
I'd known them since always.

429
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,100
Barthelemy, Piero and Roger,
the Blaiseau boys.

430
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,460
Two weeks before Liberation
our camp was attacked,

431
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,950
They shot at us,

432
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,380
I heard them fall one after the other.

433
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,440
The last one I saw was Roger.

434
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,620
I took off.

435
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,150
I ran for hours,

436
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,720
until I realised no one
was chasing me anymore.

437
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:21,030
I may have been
of some use in my life...

438
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,630
but I've never saved anyone's life.

439
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,700
If you continue like that...

440
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,980
The blood won't be able to circulate
they'll end up having to amputate.

441
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,300
That'll teach you to show off
in front of someone else's wife.

442
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:05,550
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do, re, mi,

443
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,600
fa, sol, la, si, do, re, mi, fa...

444
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,020
Z, U, R, T, space.

445
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,630
- Y, U, I, O, P...
- Fa, sol, la...

446
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,110
- A, Z, E, R, T...
- Do, re, mi, Fa, sol...

447
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,900
Load.

448
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,430
Unload.

449
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,890
Faster!

450
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,580
First in the qualifying heat...

451
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,620
Pamphyle!

452
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,970
Faster!

453
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,820
First in the last 8: Pamphyle!

454
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,770
First in the quarter-final:

455
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,110
Pamphyle!

456
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,420
"...apparait l'aurore"...

457
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,480
New paragraph.

458
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,080
Faster!

459
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,400
First in the semi-finals:

460
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,440
Pamphyle!

461
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,000
Faster!

462
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,070
I can't go faster than the typewriter!

463
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,950
Pamphyle, Pamphyle!

464
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,320
Faster! Faster!

465
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,790
Ladies and gentlemen...

466
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,580
We are proud to present...

467
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,580
with 491 strokes a minute...

468
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,040
the new speed typing champion...

469
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,070
of Lower Normandy...

470
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,890
Rose Pamphyle!

471
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,670
Monsieur Jean, Rose is in the news!

472
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,610
She's famous!

473
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,080
ROSE PAMPHYLE:
THE CHARMED FINGERS
OF A NORMANDY GIRL

474
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,560
Being famous is not a profession!

475
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,250
It's 435 francs, madame Bourges.

476
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,720
I always knew you had
something extra! A true virtuosa!

477
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,910
I'd love to come to Paris
to cheer you on...

478
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,210
<i>but my husband doesn't want to.</i>

479
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,780
<i>The French championship !
It must be amazing !</i>

480
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,500
<i>I lost my voice from...</i>

481
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,570
shouting your name
from the grandstands.

482
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,860
I hadn't seen her like that
since our honeymoon!

483
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to be able to work in peace!

484
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,510
For the most beautiful Rose of them all!

485
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,080
Oh, that's just great!

486
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,700
Thank you!

487
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,090
Feel like a going for a good time
with me this evening?

488
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,620
We have to celebrate this victory!

489
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,180
It's just that...

490
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,890
I have to train!

491
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,160
She needs to increase her speed
and especially improve her endurance.

492
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,680
'She' doesn't doubt that...

493
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,420
Perhaps but meanwhile she's still well
below the record for France.

494
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:59,790
Perhaps it might help 'her' if her
trainer gave her the exact scores!

495
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,790
She should trust her trainer more.

496
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,880
And you should speak a little more
politely to your secretary!

497
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,010
- She's a champion, now!
- Yes.

498
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,100
That's good, Rose.

499
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,580
Great, even.

500
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,650
Louis must be proud of you.

501
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,570
He never congratulates me...

502
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,120
He's convinced you'll go far!

503
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,900
But he's a nervous type.

504
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,550
He's so scared to lose face
in front of Bob!

505
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,590
Yes.

506
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,010
Right. After all,
it's all about THEM!

507
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,050
Rose...

508
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,110
You know how men are.

509
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,010
I was hoping they weren't all like that.

510
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,420
You're an odd thing.

511
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,550
What type of man are you hoping for?

512
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,710
One who considers me his equal.

513
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,130
Yes.

514
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,480
- What else?
- Well...

515
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,070
Definitely older than me

516
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,930
but who doesn't act like a kid.

517
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,910
A man with his eye on the future.
A demanding man...

518
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,450
but not completely sure of himself.

519
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,300
It's a lot more fun to have
someone you can torment.

520
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,490
I've nothing against smokers,
but I'd rather he smoked less.

521
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,710
Who do you mean?

522
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,490
No-one.

523
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,860
No-one in particular.

524
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,400
You haven't lived here for months,

525
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,160
who would leave a message?

526
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,300
My father.

527
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,040
He doesn't know my address and...

528
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,910
I'll be sure to tell him about
your new lifestyle, if he calls.

529
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,560
You think the
neighborhood doesn't know

530
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,770
what's going on
between Echard and you?

531
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
What did you do after work?

532
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,640
I left early.
You seemed odd, all day.

533
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,470
Well... odder than usual.

534
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,010
I'm tired, that's all.

535
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,880
You remembered...

536
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,100
Thank you, Mr Echard.

537
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,150
Happy birthday, my dear.

538
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,840
What powerful lungs!

539
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,280
See? I was right to make you run.

540
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,550
I made it myself.

541
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,540
Eh...

542
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,670
It's original!

543
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,660
Look.

544
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,090
Go ahead.

545
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,800
Type something.

546
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,450
I wouldn't see anything,
it's stupid.

547
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,660
Au contraire.

548
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,060
Thanks to this you'll learn
to type without looking at the keys.

549
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,190
You'll have one hell of an edge
over your competitors.

550
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,770
You really don't understand
anything about women.

551
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,660
You're just a spoiled child!

552
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,570
It took me hours to make this blind,

553
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,040
and I did it for you!

554
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:39,040
No! You did it for Bob, for Marie,

555
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,840
for the whole world,
but not for me!

556
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,680
We should have more
evenings like this.

557
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,210
I don't feel like talking.

558
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,880
<i>No problem, buddy.</i>

559
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,860
I got lots of stuff to tell you.

560
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,560
- The other day...
- It's just that Rose...

561
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,660
Has the impression I'm using her.

562
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,690
But I'm doing all this for her.

563
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,590
So she gets the recognition
she deserves.

564
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,670
She doesn't realize
what a gift she has.

565
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,170
She's making incredible
progress, I swear.

566
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,020
Look who's there...

567
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,220
Been a while since you've
been around, treasure.

568
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,240
Welcome home Echard...

569
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,790
Bottoms up!

570
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,770
[ALL MY APOLOGIES]

571
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:26,680
Come in.

572
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,260
I think it's time
to take a break.

573
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,170
It'll do us good... both of us

574
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,060
Christmas is coming.

575
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,590
Take a vacation,
spend time with your family.

576
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,140
Who'll help you trim
the tree if I'm gone?

577
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,950
My parents, brothers and  wives
will be here for the holidays.

578
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,720
- There won't be enough bedrooms.
- I'll sleep in the salon.

579
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,880
Just tell your parents
I'm the housekeeper.

580
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:53,910
Rose.

581
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,510
- I don't want to go back to my father.
- More's the reason.

582
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,890
It's the ideal occasion to make peace.

583
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,290
Sweet dreams, my dear.

584
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,570
Rose!

585
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,000
Who'd have thought to see you here?

586
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,970
You father's spending
Christmas eve at Maurice's.

587
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,220
Do you want me to ask
someone to give you a lift?

588
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,670
I'm not sure Maurice
would be happy to see me.

589
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,710
Papa kept it all this time?

590
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,690
Yes. He never stops saying how he
should have never ordered that gadget.

591
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,030
Gotta run, now. I'm making
dinner for everybody.

592
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,100
I'm very happy to see you!
And SO proud of you...

593
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,530
Do you realize what a life you have?

594
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:02,770
You have everything
a modern girl can dream of.

595
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,870
<i>I "have everything a modern
girl can dream of", mom.</i>

596
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,610
It's hard enough just being a girl.

597
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,630
My only talent
is being able to type fast.

598
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,010
<i>At first I liked it,
it allowed me to stop thinking.</i>

599
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,920
<i>You feel less out of place
when you think of nothing.</i>

600
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,530
<i>It does one good.</i>

601
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,270
<i>But it doesn't last.</i>

602
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,600
<i>It's not something you can share...</i>

603
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,910
<i>with anyone.</i>

604
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,060
<i>This makes me feel even more strange.</i>

605
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,920
<i>People don't really see me.</i>

606
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,340
<i>They find me too odd to love.</i>

607
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,190
<i>Even papa.</i>

608
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,680
<i>Even Louis.</i>

609
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,000
<i>Still, it's not so hard to see
that I'm a person like anyone else.</i>

610
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,360
<i>You understood that.</i>

611
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,840
<i>Why only you, dammit?</i>

612
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,020
Sorry to wash up here unannounced.

613
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,810
I really didn't know where to go.

614
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,170
You're not spending Christmas
with Louis?

615
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,260
No, he asked to sleep
elsewhere to night.

616
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,180
What a boor!

617
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,580
He rarely sees his family...

618
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,740
Mr. Taylor is right.

619
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,770
I thought I'd go to the boarding house
but my bicycle has a flat.

620
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,530
I'm not sure I'd make it to
downtown Lisieux in this weather.

621
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:07,110
Dear, car keys, please.

622
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,770
<i>Helping clients paint their picket fences?</i>

623
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,510
<i>Why not work for free?</i>

624
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,050
To stay in business you can't
just "lend a helping hand".

625
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,290
It's important to have grateful clients.

626
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,240
Grateful...
For a job well done.

627
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,480
Not for grandstanding.

628
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,840
I prefer a small office,
to be closer to the people.

629
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:30,580
Ah, the people, the people...

630
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,070
These 'people' must not have
much respect for you, then?

631
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,270
- Expecting someone, dear?
- No.

632
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,240
Ah, Marie!

633
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,760
What a nice surpiese!

634
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,060
- Where's Bob?
- Good evening, all.

635
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,100
How about the kids?

636
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,170
They send a big kiss.

637
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,990
Anyway they're waiting for me.
I just came to drop off this lady.

638
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,540
Will you tell them,
or shall I?

639
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,430
Fine, may I present Rose Pamphyle...

640
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,840
Louis' fiancée.

641
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,100
- When were you going to tell us?
- You big dope!

642
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,720
- It's all completely...
- Rude!

643
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,100
A fiancé should welcome
his fiancée at the station.

644
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,820
- Papa!
- He's so shy!

645
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,310
- Mom!
- So, Merry Christmas, gotta run.

646
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,990
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Marie.

647
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,190
Rose! Oh!

648
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,260
- Come in.
- Don't stand in the hall.

649
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,340
- Enchanté.
- Come in, come...

650
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,650
Arent you cagey, eh?

651
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,710
How long have you been
seeing each other?

652
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,010
- About a year.
- Not long.

653
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,610
It's about a year that I've
been working at the office.

654
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,900
But Louis took months
to declare his intentions.

655
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,700
No doubt, he thought
he was too old for me.

656
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,280
I never said that.

657
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,930
Well, I'm ten years younger
than your father, dear.

658
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,050
As you can see
it's lasted over 40 years.

659
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,850
As long as there's love,
age matters little.

660
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,310
When's the wedding?

661
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:01,030
We're not that far yet.
I'd rather take our time.

662
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,640
That's all you ever do, is take your time.

663
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,460
You'll regret it
if the Americans land again.

664
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,520
If one of them is faster
than you and marries me.

665
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,710
You should stop drinking, dear.

666
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,130
You may have regrets
of your own, tomorrow.

667
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,530
Are these the bottles
from the Van Gogh?

668
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,330
Eh ! Let's drink to the
fortune lost by my idiot son.

669
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,460
George!

670
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,220
Only he could sidestep
such a windfall. A Van Gogh...

671
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,230
And this good-for-nothing son
took over the office.

672
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,750
If Leonard or Lucien
had taken charge...

673
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,850
Here we go again...

674
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:37,000
I swear business would
be more prosperous.

675
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,940
No wonder Leonard or Lucien
didn't take over the office.

676
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,270
- They knew what to expect from you.
- Hey you...

677
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,020
Your son is a brillant man.

678
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:48,340
He would surely show it
if you didn't always criticise him.

679
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,370
"important to be number one" What idiocy!

680
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,690
You got some gall!

681
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,570
It's nice to see a woman in love.

682
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,830
- Welcome among us.
- Welcome.

683
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,380
Cheers!

Hold on, dear.

00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,750
First thing I'll do
before the honeymoon...

688
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,570
...is change the decor.

689
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,960
- I'll give that Marie an earful!
- Go on.

690
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,060
It's not so terrible
being engaged for one evening.

691
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,840
You don't know what
you're saying, you're...

Hmm, TU !
We're getting familiar, now!

693
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,550
Nice, huh?

694
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,830
I'll sleep on the canapé.
We're not married yet.

695
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:49,490
Louis!

696
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,140
Yes?

697
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:53,180
I'm gonna fight like crazy
for the championship.

698
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:58,560
MY father will eat his hat
he'll be so proud of you.

699
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,690
I'd bet against her
without hesitating.

700
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,000
The real question is
will you have the guts Louis?

701
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,420
Double or nothing?

702
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,180
Where is she?

703
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:16,140
Who?

704
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,390
Your fiancée.

705
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,640
No need to be so smug.

706
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,790
It was so stupid of you
not to bring her.

707
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,300
- I love that girl.
- You're not alone.

708
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,110
It took days
for my mother to calm down.

709
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,840
She's crazy about Rose.

710
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,420
- My word, you're jealous !
- Not at all.

711
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,340
You'd like to keep her just
for yourself, wouldn't you?

712
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,380
Rose is free, to hear you tell it
you'd think we were lovers.

713
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:38,780
Ah, see?

714
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,730
I was sure
nothing happened yet.

715
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,440
You placed bets on me?

716
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:53,640
- She likes you, Louis.
- And you like her.

717
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,970
Will you stop trying
to decide for me!

718
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:00,090
If I'd listened to you a year ago,
she'd have gone back home!

719
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,170
Rose mustn't think of anything
but the championship.

720
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:04,340
I can lay the world
at her feet, dammit!

721
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:08,580
You're so proud that the only
woman good enough for you
must be a world champion.

722
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,810
No-one will ever be
good enough for you, Louis.

723
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,110
You should stop reading
all those psychology books.

724
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,070
They don't agree with you.

I'm still the same.

746
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,170

You can't do this to me.

What makes you think
it'd be my first time?

755
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,320
It's alright Louis. This is 1959.

756
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,150
It's been ages since girls

That's one less thing
I need to teach you.

760
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,790
I can do better.

761
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,010
Mademoiselle Leprince-Ringuet,

762
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,650
you're defending your title

763
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,200
of French Champion
for the third time.

764
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,930
And what's more, within the
walls of the House of Japy.

765
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,730
All the major, preferred clients of
the brand, were specially invited here.

766
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:28,840
- Are you nervous?
- Do I look nervous?

767
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,210
It's because Annie's the best
that we sponsor her.

768
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:36,070
My father, Edmond Japy, has created
a ball bearing carriage,

769
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,520
especially for her.

770
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,420
Ball bearings, Mr Japy?

771
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:42,140
Yes, you see,
the stems of adjacent keys

772
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,900
tended to jam in the old machines,

773
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:49,940
so we started by conceiving
the AZERTY keyboard,

774
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:54,180
in such a way that the most
contiguous letters in our language...

775
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,620
Simply put, with ball bearings,

776
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,100
you just graze the carriage and... shoom!

777
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,260
No harm done if we leave now
no one would notice.

778
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:07,520
No, you stay and
you show them what you can do.

779
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,240
Do you think you'll beat your own record

780
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:11,840
of 500 strokes a minute?

781
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,710
A champion does not think...

782
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,750
she does!

783
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:21,940
Oh la la! She has all eyes on her.

784
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,110
I'm just a poor dope from nowhere.

785
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,030
It's your greatest asset,

786
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,730
the element of surprise.

01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:49,460

793
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,950
Mademoiselle, hello.
Which region?

794
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:04,300
Lower Normandy.

795
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,070
That's her, look!

796
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:28,650
<i>- Annie!
- Annie! Annie!</i>

797

Allez, Annie! Bravo!

798
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,780
- Go Annie.
- Go, Annie! Allez!

799
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:43,640

805
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:24,100

806

808

<i>Leprince-Ringuet,</i>

809

811

Bravo!

812
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,530
Silence, please.

813
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,580
Right then, Mademoiselle
Leprince-Ringuet will face

814
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:44,410
Mademoiselle Pamphyle in the final.

815
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,410
Mesdemoiselles,

816
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,560
hands above your keyboards.

817
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:57,140
Mesdames et Messieurs,
we're witnessing a rare event:

818
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:00,700
both our finalists have exactly
the same number of strokes,

819
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:03,750
that is 498 strokes per minute.

820
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:08,110
In order to decide
between the finalists,

821
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:12,650
the jury has decided to have
a 5 minute tie-breaker.

822
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,760
Good, so...

823
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,100
5 minutes.

824
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,330
Everything's on the line for 5 minutes!

825
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,340
Give it all you've got Rose.
Hear me? All you've got!

826
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,680
I can't take any more.

827
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,090
This is the moment for which
we worked so hard.

828
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,290
It's good enough
just to have gotten this far.

829
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,810
- I'm fine with it.
- I'm NOT fine with it.

830
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,450
You've been limp since the
start of the compétition!

831
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:35,320
You wanna disappoint me
in the final too?

832
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:40,540
I lied to you, Rose,

833
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:43,530
the 500 strokes a minute
of Leprince-Ringuet,

834
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,600
you passed that quite
a while ago during training.

835
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:50,480
You hate me, huh?

836
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:52,450
That's the whole point.

837
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,390
Make it happen!

838
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,960
Beat it, Gilbert!
Let me refocus.

839
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,480
Alright refocus, dear, refocus.

840
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,310
Mesdemoiselles,
hands above your keyboards.

841
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,560
Ah, here's the man who beat
my two-time French champion.

842
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,510
It wasn't me who won.

843
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,880
Edmond Japy, pleased to meet you.

844
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,350
- Louis Echard.
- Yes, I know.

845
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:27,570
Don't make that face.
It's a happy moment, no?

846
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,360
I'll be happy when Rose
is world champion.

847
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:32,730
Ah, yes. But France
has never beat America.

848
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,260
You really think you're
the man for this situation?

849
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:38,200
Are you saying it's you, maybe?

850
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:39,720
Wait...

851
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,570
If you hadn't angered her before,

852
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,690
she would have missed the boat.

853
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,140
Now that you lied to her
about her scores,

854
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,040
you have no more cards
left to play in New York.

855
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,500
She has two months left
to beat the Americans.

856
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,820
And you know those people will
make any sacrifice for their champions.

857
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,760
I thought I could say the same about you.

858
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,500
<i>Over here, please!</i>

859
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,260
Louis?

860
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,650
Louis?

861
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,210
I love you.

862
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,430
Why are you hiding?

863
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:45,520
A journalist from the Paris Match
wants to know everything about us.

864
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:48,560
Maybe you can tell him all the
nice things you think about me.

865
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,780
Watch out,
Japy offered me a contract!

866
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:53,150
- Perfect.
- What?!... Perfect?

867
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,980
- You don't think I accepted?!
- It's the chance of a lifetime.

868
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:58,440
- They have the means to make you win.
- You talk like them!

869
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,160
You can become a star,
tour the world, meet tons of people.

870
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:02,210
I couldn't care less!

871
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,130
Leave Saint-Fraimbault
and Lisieux once and for all!

872
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:07,270
- You don't need me anymore, Rose.
- It's you, that I want.

873
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,060
Your place is here.

874
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,620
Accept who you are, dammit!

875
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,030
I love you!

876
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,790
I don't.

877
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,350
You're lying.

878
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:23,960
You've proved you can lie.

879
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,410
Without the championships,

880
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,080
we would have never
ended up in the same bed.

881
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,490
You're lying.

882
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:35,190
You needed it, to win.

883
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:42,480
I thought you were better than that.

884
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,510
We all make mistakes in our youth.

885
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:18,400
- Morning.
- Morning.

886
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,720
How much for the typwriter
in the window?

887
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:22,200
My daughter just has to have it.

888
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:24,870
Do you realize, papa,
it's the one Rose Pamphyle...

889
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,980
..placed her fingers on
for the very first time!

890
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,640
Your daughter is great!

891
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,790
A true fount of inspiration!

892
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:31,820
So?

893
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,270
How much?

894
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,360
Me, Rose Pamphyle,

895
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:44,970
whether I'm beating a record

896
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,360
or just typing a letter,

897
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,060
I'm always ahead!

898
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:49,100
And I do it on...

899
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,550
"la Populaire" from Japy.

01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:52,150
You've never gone past 508.

951
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,960
I don't think you know
who you're up against.

952
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:57,740
In ten years, Hunter won
5 world championships

953
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,740
and beat her own record
each time.

954
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,070
I'm sure I can do more than
508 strokes, Mme Shorofsky.

955
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,090
You're lying.

956
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,600
I never lie.

957
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:13,500
There's really nothing
to celebrate Mr. Japy.

958
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,390
You haven't seen the latest
sales figures of the "Populaire".

959
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:20,880
Come now, run along !
You've made her work for hours.

960
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,370
That's enough.

961
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,590
For you.

962
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,480
Go on, scoot!

963
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,830
There !

964
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,450
What a killjoy!

965
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:47,410
Is it really necessary to
kiss all the typing champions?

966
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:49,800
Yes it's a sort of tradition.

967
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:55,060
And when they lose, you leave them,
standing at the bottom of the podium.

968
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:57,120
Still part of the tradition?

969
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:00,190
I knew you weren't stupid.

970
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,970
I've read some books.

971
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:23,120
Don't stop.

972
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:26,140
Here you are.

973
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:29,310
Not a moment too soon.

974
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:34,140
Bob's worried sick about you.

975
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:38,510
Aren't you fed up hiding behind him
to tell me what 'you' feel?

976
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,510
What happened to you?

977
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:49,180
- The last time I saw you like this...
- You'd just dumped me.

978
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:53,290
Funny you remember, you always
pretended it was no big deal.

979
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,630
You'd say I did the same.

980
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,170
What did Bob have that I didn't?

981
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:03,180
- You're completely drunk.
- I'm completely sober.

982
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:04,840
What did he have that I didn't?

983
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:07,480
Answer!

984
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:14,190
He proposed that two of us share one life.

985
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,860
Not you.

986
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:20,490
You left to defend the country,
without promises.

987
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:24,260
You could have married me before liberation.

988
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:27,220
And offer you widowhood
as a wedding gift?

989
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,730
You didn't die in combat, Louis.

990
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:32,310
Let yourself live, for God's sake.

991
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:35,760
And you let yourself live,
shut away in this house?

992
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:38,290
I don't need to prove anything to myself.

993
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,290
I made choices.

994
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,560
You never had that kind of courage.

995
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:46,550
Every time you embrace Bob,

996
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,360
every time you hold your children
in your arms, you should thank me.

997
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:51,050
Thank you for what?

998
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,150
I was crazy about you.

999
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:56,530
And you ...

1000
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:01,270
You preferred the best ...

1001
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:02,670
supporting role.

1002
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:10,640
In Paris, when Rose won ...

1003
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:13,810
she climbed the podium with such joy ...

1004
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:16,380
with that immense smile.

1005
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:21,590
You had that same smile,
the day I saw you with Bob.

1006
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:25,960
I thought I could do
never make her as happy.

1007
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:30,740
I smiled because I felt loved.

1008
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:56,070
I'm scared to death.

1009
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,900
Everyone is afraid, Louis.

1010
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:17,500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1011
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:22,400
<i>welcome to the thirty-ninth annual
typewriting championship of the world.</i>

1012
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:26,950
<i>At the Archer theater,
right here in downtown New York City.</i>

1013
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,330
<i>We are approaching the quarter-final.</i>

1014
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:34,400
<i>This event is
beyond compare, Gaston.</i>

1015
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:37,520
<i>Absolutely. The organizers
spent months</i>

1016
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:40,190
composing texts of
equivalent difficulty

1017
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,380
<i>and the same number of characters.</i>

1018
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:45,480
<i>That don't deal with
politics, or religion,</i>

1019
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:49,040
<i>nothing which might offend
or upset the contestants.</i>

1020
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:58,270
<i>We can say without a doubt
that Italy is eliminated.</i>

1021
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,420
<i>Look at Hong
Chi-ling's mastery!</i>

1022
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:03,850
<i>England is tiring,
will she go the distance?</i>

1023
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:06,300
<i>Hunter is dominating
the competition.</i>

1024
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,880
<i>And she's still
the favorite this year.</i>

1025
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:16,810
Ladies and gentlemen,

1026
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:20,610
only four countries remain in the semifinals.

1027
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,350
The Federal Republic of
Germany,

1028
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:24,580
France,

1029
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:27,550
the Republic of Korea, and...

1030
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,350
the United States of America!

1031
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:38,490
Vai, Rose!

1032
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:55,580
Ladies a gentlemen.

1033
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,910
May I have your attention?

1034
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:04,180
The International
Speed Typing Federation

1035
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,230
is proud to announce

1036
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,350
in the final...

1037
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:12,970
is the United Statesof America...

1038
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:15,640
versus France!

1039
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,570
It'll be France head to head
against United States in the final!

1040
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,740
What's with the eyes?
You look like Bambi.

1041
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:46,050
Where do you think you're going?

1042
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:47,790
Backstage.

1043
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,510
I need to focus.

1044
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:53,730
If you leave now, they'll
realize you're ill at ease.

1045
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:09,470
Ladies and gentlemen,

1046
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,310
silence please!

1047
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:14,610
Ladies!

1048
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:17,300
Hands over the keyboards.

1049
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,490
They're off!
Only three 5-minute rounds...

1050
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:31,430
separate us from the crowning
of the World Champion, 1959!

1051
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:28,190
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1052
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:35,100
the winner of the first round of the final is...

1053
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,920
Rose... Pamphyle!

1054
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:42,510
- With 510 strokes a minute.
- Yes! Yes!

1055
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,930
Susan Hunter...

1056
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:48,240
just behind

1057
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:53,440
with 509 strokes a minute!

1058
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,990
Susan! Susan!

1059
01:34:56,570 --> 01:34:59,390
Susan! Susan!

1060
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:02,600
Susan! Susan!

1061
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:04,450
Silence, please.

1062
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,470
Ladies,

1063
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,490
Hands over the keyboards.

1064
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,040
And I thought the French were
only good in the kitchen !

1065
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:50,590
[MY APOLOGIES]

1066
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,280
Not bad.

1067
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:30,000
Just in time for the second round.

1068
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:31,390
Well, go on!

1069
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:34,200
Run to your champion
and try to get her back.

1070
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:37,140
If I were you,
I'd probably do the same.

1071
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:39,490
It makes me think...

1072
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,710
How will she react to seeing you?

1073
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,910
She may fall into your arms...

1074
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,720
But she may also reject you.

1075
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:48,680
She'd have every reason to.

1076
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:53,450
Either way, I'd be surprised
if she remained focused.

1077
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:54,540
She'll lose.

1078
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,270
So then, all those hours of training,

1079
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:01,020
all those sacrifices,
for what?

1080
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:04,940
So you can destroy everything
you always dreamed of?

1081
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,570
Susan Hunter...

1082
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,770
maintains her world record

1083
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,460
of 512 strokes a minute!

1084
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,830
Rose Pamphyle,

1085
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:21,490
with 506 strokes a minute!

1086
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:24,740
It's incredible!
Pamphyle left the stage!

1087
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:29,160
We'll never let you near her,
you two bit insurer.

1088
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,660
You can't give up. Not now.

1089
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:52,600
What do you intend to do,
with this old machine?

1090
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,610
It'll slow you down even more.

1091
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:57,040
The old machine's fine.

1092
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:15,620
You started off too fast.
It's always been your problem.

1093
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,190
I thought it was yours.

1094
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,220
What are they saying? (<i>Was sagen sie?)</i>

1095
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,170
No idea. (<i>Keine ahnung)</i>

1096
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,160
For some time I've realized ...

1097
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,730
I'm only happy when I can help someone.

1098
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,160
I let you believe

1099
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:40,430
that you needed my help...

1100
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,730
But the minute I saw you

1101
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,600
I knew it was me who couldn't do
without you.

1102
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:53,370
Because you make me happy.

1103
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:57,660
<i>It's a declaration of love!</i>

1104
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:03,600
I love you.

1105
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:07,580
Ti amo

1106
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,610
Te quiero.

1107
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:09,640
S' agapo.

1108
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:11,690
Ich liebe dich.

1109
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:25,210
If you stay one more minute,

1110
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,100
You'll be diqualified.

1111
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:34,690
Any advice before I go back?

1112
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,960
Crush her, my dear.

1113
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,120
What are you doing?

1114
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:10,980
You can't change machines in the
middle of a world championship!

1115
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:13,760
Look here, if you don't immediately
switch back to "la Populaire"

1116
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:16,960
you'll have to repay every
cent I spent on you!

1117
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:19,690
I already earned you double.

1118
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:21,990
If you won't do it for my father,

1119
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:23,770
do it for me.

1120
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:26,190
That kiss wasn't so special, Gilbert.

1121
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:29,020
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, silence please!</i>

1122
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:37,550
Don't disappoint me, <i>kid</i>.
I bet on you this time!

1123
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:41,660
Ladies...

1124
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,630
Hands over the keyboards.

1125
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:01,130
<i>- Last lap for Pamphyle.
- Anything's possible, Gaston.</i>

1126
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:05,540
Pamphyle is sure to trumph,
within easy reach of victory!

1127
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:12,760
Go, go!

1128
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,620
Pamphyle seems possessed
by her machine!

1129
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:39,290
<i>Rather, she is possessing
her machine, you mean.</i>

1130
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,020
Allez, allez!

1131
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:56,900
Only 40 seconds
to the end of the round.

1132
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:09,190
My God! My God, no!

1133
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:12,850
Pamphyle can no longer type.
What a catastrophy!

1134
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,670
You can do it!

1135
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,870
- She's faster than the machine.
- I know.

1136
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:36,730
You may think I'm crazy, but the only way

1137
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,270
for the machine to keep up with her

1138
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,950
is to assemble all the letters
on a single support.

1139
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,870
On a mechanism not much bigger
than...

1140
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,340
a golfball! It's a golfball!

1141
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,070
Let me fix this.

1142
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:53,690
I'll sell it. We split 50 - 50.

1143
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:58,030
Gentlemen,

1144
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,620
I have something I think you're
going to be vry interested in.

1145
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:05,020
Immagine a golfball with all
the letters of the keyboard on it.

1146
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:27,220
Great performance, my dear.

1147
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:37,380
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
may I have your attention please!</i>

1148
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:41,000
The International
Speed Typing Federation

1149

1150

1152
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,500
With 515 strokes a minute

1153
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,980
smashing the world record,

1154
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,160
the winner...

1155
01:44:59,030 --> 01:45:02,790
the fastest girl in the world is...

1156
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,520
Rose Pamphyle!

1157
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,930
Rose Pamphyle!

1158
01:45:21,550 --> 01:45:23,050
Incredible!

1159
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:27,380
<i>Rose Pamphyle is the
the world champion of 1959.</i>

1160
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:47,770
If a French guy invented this,
Why the hell d'you come to me?

1161
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,490
America for business,

1162
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:52,250
France for love.
