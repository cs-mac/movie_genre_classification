1
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,298
THE CRIMSON RIVERS

2
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,014
We will touch base in two hours.

3
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,847
- Which way do we go?
- There.

4
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:22,339
Okay? See you later, guys.

5
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:32,223
Can I help you?

6
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:33,802
Got a light?

7
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,515
Who let you through?

8
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:38,675
Your men. Commissioner Pierre Niemans.

9
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,592
Just you?
Paris said they'd send a unit.

10
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,342
What the hell?

11
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:46,755
I am the unit.

12
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:52,430
Captain...

13
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:57,387
I didn't drive all night
to wage war with cops.

14
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:00,713
What's the lowdown?

15
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:03,723
Follow me.

16
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:09,880
Two days ago, the college dean
reported Remy Callois missing.

17
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:12,048
Thirty-two years old, single.

18
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:15,804
Remy lectured at the college.
He was also the librarian.

19
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:17,841
An upper echelon job there.

20
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,259
According to the Dean,
Remy was punctual and hardworking.

21
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,388
He never showed up late.

22
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:28,676
Yesterday afternoon a young
mountain climber found his body.

23
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,514
Why call in the homicide squad?

24
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,129
We're not used to this kind of stuff.

25
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,505
Why?

26
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:43,223
His body was strung up there.
At 50 meters.

27
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:59,008
GUERNON University, 500 meters

28
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,762
You're from the homicide unit,
but not really, is that it?

29
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,005
That's it.

30
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:13,680
We never dealt with you before.

31
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:16,968
You're lucky.

32
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:27,304
"Happy is he who penetrates
the hidden cause of things."

33
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:47,046
What's this college doing here?

34
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:48,760
It's no ordinary college.

35
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,633
It provides its own electricity,
its own water.

36
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:54,424
It even has a hospital.

37
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,672
1,200 students.
100 professors and researchers.

38
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:00,882
One of Europe's oldest universities.

39
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:07,548
In case of a snowstorm,
it can survive for a month.

40
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:11,639
The Dean is
like the mayor of the valley.

41
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,757
He runs most of the region.

42
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:17,472
Here's where they
form future Bill Gates.

43
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:20,969
Future what?

44
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:25,592
Future Bill Gates.

45
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:22,011
The hospital's attached to the college?

46
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,754
It's open to everyone in the region.

47
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,556
We all get free health care.

48
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,722
We work a lot with them.

49
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:32,923
There's even a maternity wing.

50
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:50,718
This is Commissioner Niemans.
He will be helping out on this case.

51
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:53,592
I was in your Criminology class in 1987.

52
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,003
Did you start yet?

53
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:56,888
I haven't cut the cord.

54
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,170
Can we see?

55
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:01,963
I figured you'd want to see him intact.
It's incredible.

56
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,931
The work of a real madman.

57
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:07,263
He strove for the fetal position.

58
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:09,088
What position?

59
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:13,589
The fetal. Like a fetus
in its mother's belly.

60
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:39,046
He's been dead for 48 hours.

61
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:43,009
Examination reveals
traces of incisions...

62
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:47,136
on the shoulders, arms,
elbows and thighs...

63
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:50,390
made by a sharp instrument.
A carpet cutter.

64
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,548
Can you cut the cord?

65
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:58,132
Four broken ribs.

66
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:01,673
Arms broken at the shoulders and elbows.

67
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:07,763
Multiple fractures: tibia, hip...I will
put it all in a detailed report.

68
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:12,514
The hands were amputated before
he died, with an axe...

69
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:16,723
the stumps cauterized to avoid
his bleeding to death.

70
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:21,214
The killer obviously wanted
to keep his victim alive.

71
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:57,299
I wouldn't do that...

72
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,921
He carved out the eyes like a surgeon.

73
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,797
Operating on a live patient.

74
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,589
What the fuck is this shit?

75
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,765
The sockets were filled with rain.
It's being analyzed.

76
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:14,962
There's a good eye doctor in Guernon.
He may shed some light on this.

77
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,424
How long did it take him to die?

78
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:24,680
I'd have to cut him open,
but I'd say five hours.

79
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,596
The size and precision
of the wounds...

80
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:34,171
indicate that he wanted
his victim conscious...

81
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:37,141
but in the greatest
possible state of pain.

82
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:52,715
Check every prison,
every loony bin and sect.

83
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:54,969
Every trail, refuge and ski slope.

84
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,632
Run random identity checks on drivers
in a 160 kilometer radius.

85
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:04,173
Dig up evidence of similar mutilations
in the past 20 years.

86
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:07,430
Talk to possible witnesses
and Callois's colleagues.

87
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:09,755
Anyone who knew his itinerary.

88
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,931
Find out where it rained
in the past two days.

89
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:17,549
Find anything: witnesses, clues...
you have two hours.

90
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,639
Doctor Cherneze Ophthalmologist

91
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:25,261
Who's there?

92
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,051
Who's there?

93
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:33,515
Who is it?

94
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,588
Why won't you talk?

95
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:38,221
Doctor.

96
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:40,804
- Who are you?
- What's going on?

97
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,384
Get the dog out of here.

98
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,634
It's nothing. Go home.
Everything's alright.

99
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:48,629
See you on Tuesday.

100
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:51,179
Who are you?

101
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,345
Commissioner Niemans. Sorry,
dogs scare me shitless.

102
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:59,806
Dogs are not to fear.
Just their masters.

103
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:04,633
How can I help you?

104
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,344
I am investigating Remy Callois's death.

105
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:14,300
I heard about it.

106
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,004
How awful.

107
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:20,550
Did you know him?

108
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,215
I knew his father.

109
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,553
We went to college together.

110
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:30,799
Did you teach at the college?

111
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,550
For 20 years.

112
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:39,215
But I stopped teaching in 1982.

113
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,594
Why?

114
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:46,050
Difference of opinion.

115
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:48,969
With the Dean?

116
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:54,090
I don't understand.
What's the link between me and Remy?

117
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:58,256
I have some pictures
I'd like your opinion of.

118
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:04,806
He was tortured?

119
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:06,842
For several hours.

120
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,925
How horrible...

121
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,509
I didn't know.

122
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:20,722
No hands?

123
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:22,300
Nor eyes.

124
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:26,094
That's why I am here.
To understand these mutilations.

125
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,056
How would I know?

126
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,431
What exactly do you treat?

127
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:33,931
Genetic afflictions concerning the eyes.

128
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:39,509
Hereditary diseases transmitted
from one generation to the next.

129
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:43,421
They strike isolated areas
and with the college...

130
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:44,972
What about the college?

131
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:48,672
Teachers have been marrying
among themselves for ages.

132
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,717
The bloodlines are weak, worn out.

133
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:55,131
Genetic problems keep popping up.

134
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,300
The ransom of the elite.

135
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:02,762
I thought the professors' kids
were prodigies.

136
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:05,176
They are.

137
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,467
I don't get it.

138
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,721
Over the past two generations...

139
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,339
the situation has reversed.

140
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:19,759
The native mountain children
are getting sick.

141
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,970
Like the boy you just saw.

142
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:31,887
Could there be a connection between
the mutilations and the diseases?

143
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:39,098
Hands and eyes are the body parts
that belong to us alone.

144
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,721
They're different from anyone else's,
like with DNA.

145
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:47,554
They're our biological identity.

146
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:53,305
Your killer is giving you hints
as to his motive.

147
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,921
And he starts stabbing away.

148
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:02,635
He stabs the dog, stabs the guy...

149
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:06,056
grabs the bag and throws
the knife under the car.

150
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:08,629
Seriously, Paris is full of psychos.

151
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,050
The subway. The cops.

152
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:13,340
Robocops.
"Hand over your ticket, please."

153
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,968
What the hell?
I am happy with my cows.

154
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:20,881
I am happy here. Fresh air.
It's amazing here.

155
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,847
Take a look at my cows.

156
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:24,931
Paris sucks.

157
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,765
Kids doing this shit.

158
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:35,344
- It's the County Mounties.
- Hi, kids.

159
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:37,387
- How's it hanging?
- What's up?

160
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:39,679
Cool it...

161
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:41,670
Can we go now?

162
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:45,638
Happy squirrel hunting.

163
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:14,390
You want the roach?

164
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:17,755
You smoke?

165
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,052
- I always have.
- You didn't before.

166
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:22,634
Now I do.

167
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:24,680
You're smoking on duty.

168
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,258
He does.

169
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:28,138
You're lower on the totem pole.

170
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,717
Where does that put you?

171
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:34,052
Harry and Sally.
Why did you come for me?

172
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:36,380
The cemetery got robbed last night.

173
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:38,298
The word is "desecrated".

174
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,927
The elementary school got desecrated, too.

175
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:43,256
The word is "robbed", dick wad.

176
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,385
Two in a day.
We're back in business, guys.

177
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:50,796
Let's start with the cemetery.
I am riding high today.

178
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:52,890
Pass the joint.

179
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:55,847
- What now?
- Nothing.

180
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:58,089
- You're sulking.
- Because you're smoking.

181
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,172
Do I sulk when you drink?

182
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:02,719
Cut the crap.
You sound like two old hookers.

183
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:19,381
You're here for the desecration.
Follow me.

184
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:21,087
I am okay.

185
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,221
It's the girl's mausoleum.

186
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,213
The only mausoleum in the cemetery.

187
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:29,139
When I got here this morning...

188
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:33,006
this is what I found.

189
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:38,762
It's those skinheads.
They're always hanging around here.

190
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:44,596
- We have skinheads?
- Not skinheads. Just kids.

191
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:47,847
- Kiddie skinheads?
- Just kid kids.

192
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,389
Did this ever happen before?

193
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,595
The first time.

194
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,880
"1972-1982".

195
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,054
She didn't make it too far.

196
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:17,889
Stop that. You have no right.

197
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,055
You need her parents' say-so.
I know the law.

198
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:23,463
Relax. No problem.

199
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,512
Where can I find the parents?

200
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:27,928
Her mother was crazy.

201
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:30,381
She said the devil killed her kid.

202
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:32,387
The devil?

203
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:33,801
You heard me.

204
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:41,390
Judith Herault
14 April 1972 - 23 September 1982

205
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:46,346
Where are your skinheads?

206
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,258
A warehouse in town.

207
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,547
Let's pay them a little visit.

208
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:53,799
First the school.
The principal's expecting us.

209
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:55,220
What's she missing?

210
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:59,306
Nothing's missing.
That's what's so strange.

211
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:02,337
I have never seen you.
Are you new here?

212
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,379
Is it that obvious?

213
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,796
What did you do to end up here?

214
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:10,635
Cops are like teachers.
We can't always choose our school.

215
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:14,504
Tell me about it. For 14 years,
I have asked to be transferred.

216
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:16,050
Now it's too late.

217
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:26,214
They broke in here,
where we keep school records.

218
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:29,426
They went about it extremely carefully.

219
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,380
Are you sure nothing's missing?

220
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:45,969
Nothing at all. I checked this morning.
It's so weird.

221
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,515
I don't understand.

222
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,469
Okay.

223
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:54,759
File a complaint at the station
this afternoon.

224
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,721
So the investigation's over?

225
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:59,759
What can I say?
No theft, no investigation.

226
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,470
Have a nice day. Goodbye.

227
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,008
Goodbye, Detective.

228
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,885
"Detective" is passé. It's
"Lieutenant" now.

229
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:24,758
Just a second.
How long have you been here?

230
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,590
Not as long as you seem to think.

231
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:29,472
If I say a name,
could it ring a bell?

232
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:30,718
Try me.

233
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,549
Judith Herault.

234
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,256
Was she one of my students?

235
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:36,924
She died in 1982.

236
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:39,588
- Should I check?
- I'd appreciate it.

237
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:42,346
You think there's a connection?

238
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:44,758
You tell me.

239
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:51,129
I wonder if she's the
one who got run over.

240
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,171
Run over?

241
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:55,880
Killed in a highway accident.
It was terrible.

242
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,005
What else?

243
00:23:57,006 --> 00:24:00,879
It was a truck. The mother was there.
She became insane.

244
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,094
How can I find the mother?

245
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:04,545
What's wrong?

246
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:08,844
The pages are torn out.
The pages from '81 and '82.

247
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:10,630
Bingo.

248
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:14,797
Any pictures?
Class photos, stuff like that.

249
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,680
The pictures are missing, too.

250
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:29,261
I will be right back.

251
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:38,545
What's the problem?

252
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,222
Any highway patrolmen here?

253
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:43,928
Not one. They're all out to lunch.

254
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,050
What for?

255
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:49,796
I need some info. I am a cop myself.

256
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,299
Information about what?

257
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,054
An accident that happened
around here 20 years ago.

258
00:24:58,058 --> 00:25:00,629
It's your lucky day. They
call me "gravedigger".

259
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:04,553
Over the past 27 years, I have
seen 248, no, wait...

260
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:07,253
249 accidents entailing deaths.

261
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:10,465
On our part of the highway alone.
30 kilometers.

262
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:13,638
Cops and firemen get all the attention.

263
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,212
But we're the first guys on the scene.

264
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:19,092
It's all in here.
What do you want to know?

265
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:21,967
- You can use that?
- What do you think?

266
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:26,763
I am looking for the parents of a girl
killed in '82. Judith Herault.

267
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:29,431
That sounds familiar.

268
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:32,636
- Judith Herault...
- H..E..R..A..U..L..T.

269
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:39,256
Search by victim's name: Judith Herault

270
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:41,635
Here we go...

271
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,765
"Judith Herault..."

272
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:50,299
"Kilometer marker 98. September '82."
She was that kid?

273
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,057
That's right.

274
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:53,421
Just a sec.

275
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:58,174
1982. It's coming back now.

276
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,096
She was run over by a semi...

277
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:05,296
That's it.

278
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:09,302
What a goddamned mess.

279
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:11,050
Here she is.

280
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:16,179
Here's her file, with the policemen's
statements...

281
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,841
pictures and all. I am warning you.
The pictures are...

282
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:22,387
Don't worry.

283
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:29,967
I warned you.

284
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,968
Jesus. What happened?

285
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:38,222
A 38 ton truck going 120 kilometers
an hour.

286
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,971
How did you identify her?

287
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:45,838
When we got there,
the mother was at the side of the road.

288
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:49,145
- She was holding...
- What?

289
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:51,261
- A finger.
- Finger.

290
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:55,673
The only piece of her
daughter still intact.

291
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:03,219
She said her kid ran away
and tried running across the highway.

292
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,553
God knows what happened.

293
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:06,922
You don't have the mother's number?

294
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:09,883
Are you kidding? It's been 20 years.

295
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:12,676
The insurance company
sent us an address...

296
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:16,880
in case we came across any new leads.

297
00:27:18,224 --> 00:27:19,682
This is too crazy.

298
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:34,182
"University of Guernon"

299
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:13,717
The Dean's office?

300
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:15,965
That way, on your left.

301
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,425
I want to see the Dean.

302
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:40,047
I am his assistant. How can I help?

303
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,387
By getting me the Dean, now.

304
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:48,503
Who shall I say is here?

305
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,223
Commissioner Niemans.

306
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,673
Commissioner Niemans for you.

307
00:29:58,016 --> 00:30:00,718
Have a seat. I will just be a minute.

308
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:24,760
I am a slave to this university.
I never have enough time.

309
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:26,137
What can I do?

310
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,928
I am investigating Callois's death.

311
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,806
I spoke to Captain Dahmane.

312
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,755
Tell me about Remy's private life.

313
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,508
Do you work with Dahmane?

314
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:39,511
Neither with nor without.
I lead a special unit.

315
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,718
It's you.

316
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,839
I don't understand what happened.

317
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:50,175
Remy never posed the slightest problem.

318
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:54,639
He was kind, hardworking.
His parents were close friends.

319
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,050
He took over his
father's job in the library.

320
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,972
He went to school here?

321
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:02,716
Like most of us.

322
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:05,509
Many students are born and grow up here.

323
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,596
Some become professors like their parents.

324
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:10,632
It's sort of the tradition.

325
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:12,550
It was the case with Remy.

326
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:16,800
He didn't have a police record.

327
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:20,671
Maybe there's something we missed,
that may be of help.

328
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:21,886
Like what?

329
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,723
Someone who hated him.

330
00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:28,007
Drug use, some religious conviction...

331
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:30,055
I think you misunderstood me.

332
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:34,759
This university is a community,
a temple of knowledge.

333
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,381
Everyone lives and works here
in perfect harmony.

334
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:41,965
To accuse one of us is to accuse
all of us, including me.

335
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:48,888
I want to visit his apartment.

336
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:53,719
I am afraid that's impossible.
The police sealed it off.

337
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,463
I'd like to see it all the same.

338
00:32:00,516 --> 00:32:02,590
Hubert, come here, please.

339
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:05,219
Unfortunately, I can't join you.

340
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,591
I hope you don't mind
if my son shows you the way.

341
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:13,589
As I told you,
traditions are a way of life here.

342
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:22,884
We have been voted "Best College"
three years in a row.

343
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:26,220
We even helped raise the national average.

344
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:30,846
Just for fun, we calculated
the average IQ here. Guess how much.

345
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:32,260
Twenty-four.

346
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:33,672
Excuse me?

347
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:36,467
Callois had room 24.
Do you have the key?

348
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:37,589
No.

349
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,594
Do you have permission to go in?

350
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,385
What did he do at the library?

351
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:02,639
He was in charge of books
and seating arrangements.

352
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:05,966
Seating arrangements?

353
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:10,093
Our tradition is to be seated
in the same place every year.

354
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:13,259
It's beneficial and makes seating easier.

355
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:03,181
"Dominissimus. Simus serve."

356
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:05,681
"Ubicum Que..."

357
00:34:05,682 --> 00:34:08,509
"We are the masters. We are the slaves."

358
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,681
"We are everywhere. We are nowhere."

359
00:34:11,974 --> 00:34:14,095
"We control the crimson rivers."

360
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,965
It was his Ph.D. thesis. He'd been
working on it for years.

361
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,719
- Fanny Ferreira?
- Up there.

362
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:04,056
- I have got to go.
- See you tomorrow.

363
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:08,425
Fanny Ferreira?

364
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:13,009
You discovered Remy Callois's corpse?

365
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:14,837
Who are you?

366
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:18,346
Pierre Niemans.
I came from Paris to investigate.

367
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,673
Paris exports cops now?

368
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:25,174
Depends on the case.

369
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:31,097
Too bad. I like the local yokels.
Their seriousness cracks me up.

370
00:35:31,098 --> 00:35:32,463
Me, too.

371
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:34,722
You can make a difference?

372
00:35:34,723 --> 00:35:38,967
I have been trying to for 25 years.
Maybe you can help.

373
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:40,717
I doubt it.

374
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:45,051
I didn't see much. I scaled the
cliff twice before noticing him.

375
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:47,515
Didn't you read my statement?

376
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:51,005
Did...

377
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:55,468
Did the killer have to be strong
to get the body up there?

378
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:57,217
Not necessarily.

379
00:35:57,516 --> 00:36:01,462
With know-how and good equipment,
you can lift anything, anywhere.

380
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:08,675
What was he like?

381
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:11,965
A pretentious asshole.
Like most students here.

382
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:14,296
I agree. It seems pretty...

383
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,511
- Uptight?
- Exactly.

384
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,798
A closed-circuit race course
for high-performance cars.

385
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:21,596
If you have been around once...

386
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:25,006
I read that you're a glaciologist.
What do you do?

387
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,889
I control avalanches.

388
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:30,755
The school's in a valley,
so I try to steer them away.

389
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,259
You protect the school.

390
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,675
I do my job.

391
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,431
- Like Remy Callois.
- What?

392
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:40,589
You went to, and work for the school,
like Remy Callois.

393
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:43,297
- So?
- You're part of the clan.

394
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:44,346
What clan?

395
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:47,337
The elite composed of professors' kids.

396
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:52,384
I have a busy day and
I don't like uniforms.

397
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:54,596
Your colleagues have my number.

398
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,097
It's the pathologist.

399
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,014
I got the results of
the water in his eyes.

400
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:10,888
It's rain water. Acid rain.

401
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,716
- What?
- It's pretty common.

402
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:16,672
But we haven't had any acid rain
since the 1970s.

403
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:18,680
And it hasn't rained recently.

404
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:21,098
I don't get it.

405
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,007
- It's ice cold.
- Freezing.

406
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:21,759
Hello, Sister.

407
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:25,338
I am a police officer.

408
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:28,051
Does a certain Mrs. Herault reside here?

409
00:38:31,683 --> 00:38:32,844
May I ask why?

410
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:38,300
I am sorry. I am afraid not. I can't say.

411
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:41,130
Sister Andrée has been here for 17 years.

412
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:44,011
This concerns a relatively old incident.

413
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:46,632
Could I possibly see her?

414
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:50,212
I will see.

415
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:51,588
Come in.

416
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:54,800
Wait here.

417
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:07,005
Take off your cap...

418
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,840
Where do you think you are?

419
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:19,545
My son.

420
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,713
Wait here.

421
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:26,804
Sister Andrée will see you.

422
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,421
- But I should warn you...
- About what?

423
00:39:29,422 --> 00:39:33,012
You can speak to her,
but you cannot see her.

424
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:35,795
You can listen, but you cannot go near.

425
00:39:35,796 --> 00:39:37,171
Why not?

426
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:39,931
The Shadows, my son.

427
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:41,884
What about the shadows?

428
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:45,848
Sister Andrée took
the Vow of the Shadows.

429
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:48,421
We haven't seen her for 15 years.

430
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:05,713
Sister...

431
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:15,760
Sister Andrée?

432
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,176
Sister?

433
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:23,680
I am a police officer from Sarzac,
just nearby.

434
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,839
Your daughter is buried there, right?

435
00:40:30,474 --> 00:40:34,006
Judith was your daughter, wasn't she?

436
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:42,346
I am here because last night
someone tried to open her tomb.

437
00:40:57,308 --> 00:40:58,848
They're coming back.

438
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,261
Who?

439
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:06,551
They're coming back
to complete their mission.

440
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:09,133
Who are you talking about?

441
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:11,473
The demons.

442
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:17,383
They want to make sure Judith
won't cause them any more trouble.

443
00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:28,925
So it's these demons
who killed your daughter?

444
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:33,216
Could you try being a
little more explicit?

445
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:36,966
For 18 years I have been trying to forget.

446
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,557
Last night...

447
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:43,557
your demons...

448
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:47,760
broke into the school
and stole Judith's class picture.

449
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:50,558
I need your help to understand why.

450
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:54,385
In order to erase every trace of my child.

451
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:58,175
What for?

452
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:02,220
To protect their secret.

453
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:07,136
What secret?

454
00:42:10,016 --> 00:42:12,587
Judith's face is a threat to them.

455
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:20,963
Please, Sister. I am sorry, but...

456
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:26,882
can you tell me the circumstances
of your daughter's death?

457
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:29,513
My daughter fell ill.

458
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:33,010
We went to the hospital she was born in.

459
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,968
Then the demons attacked us.

460
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:38,965
They chased us.

461
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:43,718
I wanted to run away,
to disappear with my daughter.

462
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:46,722
But they found us.

463
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:49,798
No one can escape their clutches.

464
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:58,178
Where did you live before Sarzac?

465
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:04,341
The nightmare began in Guernon.

466
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,845
Did you try calling the police for help?

467
00:43:14,846 --> 00:43:17,137
I speak of demons...

468
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:19,845
and you speak of police.

469
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:27,130
There's nothing you can do for my child.

470
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:31,712
Save your soul while you still can.

471
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:36,385
Leave me now.

472
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,346
I want to stop remembering.

473
00:43:44,183 --> 00:43:45,261
Forgive me.

474
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:13,055
Glaciers are formed from years
of compacted snow.

475
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:15,594
The snow is compressed into ice.

476
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:19,639
Each season has
a corresponding stratum.

477
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:24,342
This glacier is 200 metres deep.

478
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:27,384
It's a huge source
of water and energy.

479
00:44:30,141 --> 00:44:33,009
The water composing it
dates back centuries.

480
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:41,219
What's the point of studying glaciers?

481
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:44,302
The college power plant
has a research lab.

482
00:44:44,303 --> 00:44:48,682
This glacier is sliding.
We study the risk factor it represents.

483
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,176
Here.

484
00:46:13,058 --> 00:46:15,381
How far down do we have to go?

485
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:17,171
At least 30 metres.

486
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:25,514
Why did you choose me?
There are great guides in the area.

487
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:30,673
They say you're the best.
And you were available.

488
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:34,011
You enlist civilians to find murderers?

489
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:37,847
Let's say I am picking you up.

490
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,969
Put this on. Don't step on the rope.

491
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:12,504
Welcome to the time machine,
Commissioner.

492
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,761
I will compare this ice to the acid rain
you had analyzed.

493
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:50,556
We're at the right depth.

494
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:56,933
He must have brought us here for a reason.

495
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,132
There must be a clue...

496
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:01,796
a trace.

497
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:09,180
Niemans, that's dangerous.

498
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:27,720
We can't stay here.

499
00:48:28,558 --> 00:48:31,342
Water can come gushing in at any second.

500
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,389
What's back there?

501
00:48:34,016 --> 00:48:35,888
Natural water canals.

502
00:48:40,474 --> 00:48:41,848
What are you doing?

503
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:45,842
Where are you going?

504
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,712
Where are we?

505
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:26,757
An intra-glacial canal...

506
00:49:27,308 --> 00:49:30,887
dug out by the water
that feeds the power plant.

507
00:49:32,808 --> 00:49:35,012
We can't stay here. It's dangerous.

508
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,587
Let's go.

509
00:49:45,724 --> 00:49:46,921
What's wrong?

510
00:50:36,183 --> 00:50:38,884
The Light Brigade. What will it be, guys?

511
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:43,265
Nothing today.
The Chief wants to see your tenants.

512
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,879
In the back.

513
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,263
- What's up?
- I am coming.

514
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:53,968
Stay here.
I will have a word with them.

515
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:57,928
A glass of red?

516
00:51:14,558 --> 00:51:16,844
<i>Only Through Force.</i>

517
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:23,640
Hello, gentlemen.

518
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:27,931
I'd like to speak to the manager.

519
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:31,422
The head honcho.
The leader of your little group.

520
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:32,180
What for?

521
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:35,592
Police. I am new in the neighbourhood.

522
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,336
Lieutenant Max Kerkerian.
I have some questions.

523
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:42,095
Don't bother. We know you.
We don't talk to cops.

524
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,216
I will do the talking.

525
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:48,423
What can we do for you?

526
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:51,968
Tell me about
your whereabouts last night.

527
00:51:53,016 --> 00:51:54,046
What's the problem?

528
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:58,505
Some kids sprayed swastikas
on a mausoleum.

529
00:51:58,506 --> 00:52:00,139
Why ask us?

530
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,505
Skinheads, swastikas...

531
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:03,390
Swastikas, skinheads...

532
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:06,422
No swastikas here. See any swastikas?

533
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,555
- What stickers?
- Swastikas.

534
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:10,755
Hey, Kojak.

535
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,926
You're not skinheads?

536
00:52:13,224 --> 00:52:14,255
So what?

537
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:17,634
- You didn't do the school?
- What school?

538
00:52:18,308 --> 00:52:22,004
You didn't hear me.
We don't talk to cops. So get lost.

539
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,753
- No school for you.
- And you? What school?

540
00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:27,461
Sheriff school? You think you're cool?

541
00:52:27,462 --> 00:52:29,346
- Relax.
- Hands off.

542
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,258
Policeman is doing his job.

543
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,507
I am just doing my job.

544
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:35,757
What's his job? To piss us off?

545
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:38,968
Yeah. My job is to piss off your type.

546
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:40,598
What's our type?

547
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:42,929
- What's our type?
- I hate fascists.

548
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,800
Did you figure that out all by yourself?

549
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:47,845
Cool it.

550
00:52:47,846 --> 00:52:49,259
What's he after?

551
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,806
Don't play his game.

552
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:55,513
This is private property.
You better get out. I know the law.

553
00:52:55,974 --> 00:52:57,218
Yeah, get lost.

554
00:52:58,016 --> 00:52:59,294
Thanks for your help.

555
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:03,255
Cops think they're so cool.
A gun and badge and you rule.

556
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,761
Son of a bitch.

557
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:11,223
Watch this, greaseball.

558
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:17,134
No gun. No badge. What did he say?

559
00:53:17,135 --> 00:53:19,014
What? I am not a cop now.

560
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:21,755
Not a cop now? The cowboy rode off?

561
00:53:21,756 --> 00:53:24,012
Hands off. What did he say?

562
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:26,008
- What was it?
- Son of a bitch.

563
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:27,464
Son of a bitch.

564
00:53:34,766 --> 00:53:37,930
Kill the motherfucker. Get him.

565
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:48,556
- What happened?
- Max Kerkerian wins.

566
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:52,420
Warmed up?
Come and fight me, motherfucker.

567
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:55,843
Come on.

568
00:54:20,058 --> 00:54:21,634
Fucking pig.

569
00:54:23,266 --> 00:54:24,095
Take this.

570
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:28,757
Watch out, he's getting his gun.

571
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:32,762
Freeze.

572
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:39,007
Did you stick a gun at me?

573
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:43,760
Stop, it wasn't us.

574
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:47,881
What wasn't you?

575
00:54:47,882 --> 00:54:50,095
Last night at the cemetery.

576
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:52,970
We saw a guy in a white Lada.

577
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:56,471
Why didn't you say so?

578
00:54:56,472 --> 00:54:58,383
You didn't ask.

579
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:09,134
Next time you point a gun,
check for bullets.

580
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:10,630
Asshole.

581
00:55:21,808 --> 00:55:23,679
- Great vino.
- Very tasty.

582
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,343
Excellent bouquet. Really stunning.

583
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:31,095
- What happened?
- It wasn't them.

584
00:55:31,096 --> 00:55:33,257
We never had a problem with them.

585
00:55:38,558 --> 00:55:39,422
We do now.

586
00:55:41,516 --> 00:55:42,795
What the hell?

587
00:55:43,183 --> 00:55:45,671
Son of a bitch. Come here.

588
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:47,716
You will be sorry.

589
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:49,467
Asshole.

590
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:52,971
Asshole.

591
00:55:57,933 --> 00:55:59,390
What's going on?

592
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:01,300
The keys.

593
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:06,303
A list of every white Lada in the area.
Every single one.

594
00:56:06,304 --> 00:56:08,880
In one hour. Call me on the radio.

595
00:56:10,724 --> 00:56:12,264
Every white Lada.

596
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:13,345
- White what?
- Lada.

597
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:15,755
How do you spell it?

598
00:56:15,974 --> 00:56:18,048
- Beats me.
- Just take a guess.

599
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,386
L..A..D..A?

600
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,047
Here.

601
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:38,219
How are you doing?

602
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,965
Okay.

603
00:56:39,966 --> 00:56:42,013
Sorry I got you into this.

604
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:48,137
You think it's a serial killer?

605
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,423
No, a serial killer kills
in order to exist.

606
00:56:51,424 --> 00:56:54,347
I'd say we're dealing with a pointer.

607
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:55,678
A pointer?

608
00:56:55,933 --> 00:56:57,425
We go where he points.

609
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:00,884
What for?

610
00:57:01,308 --> 00:57:02,421
What for?

611
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:07,635
Either he's pointing us in a direction
I don't understand...

612
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:08,761
or?

613
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,056
Or he's playing with us.

614
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:12,172
Commissioner.

615
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:15,722
We have identified the body.

616
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,803
Excuse me.

617
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:44,932
Are you out there, Chief?

618
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:47,712
Find anything?

619
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:52,181
We found all the Ladas. There are
132 in the region.

620
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:55,300
What do we do?

621
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,046
Anything in a town called Guernon,
with a "G"?

622
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:03,298
Guernon?

623
00:58:03,974 --> 00:58:06,261
Guernon, yeah. One white Lada.

624
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:09,260
Give me the name.

625
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:13,256
It belongs to Philip Sertys.

626
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:17,514
Good job. We will talk later.

627
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:27,838
Don't do this to me, motherfucker.

628
00:58:28,266 --> 00:58:29,510
Fucking...

629
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:31,557
Shit.

630
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:32,838
Fuck.

631
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:51,633
His name is Philip Sertys.
He graduated from here.

632
00:58:52,141 --> 00:58:54,973
29 years old, single.
Became a doctor at 25.

633
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:57,382
He worked in the maternity wing.

634
00:58:58,224 --> 00:59:00,759
- Did he live on campus?
- No, in town.

635
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,556
Do you have his address?

636
00:59:03,516 --> 00:59:05,222
What exactly do you want?

637
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:08,056
To understand.

638
00:59:12,183 --> 00:59:13,095
Thanks.

639
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:18,220
Get to work.

640
01:00:54,766 --> 01:00:56,508
Stand up, nice and slow.

641
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:04,634
- Don't move.
- I am a cop.

642
01:01:04,635 --> 01:01:06,431
I said I am a cop.

643
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:10,796
Keep it slow.

644
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:16,885
- Give me my gun, asshole.
- Don't move.

645
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:19,095
You're under arrest. I am a cop.

646
01:01:20,558 --> 01:01:21,836
Give me my gun.

647
01:01:21,837 --> 01:01:24,550
They teach lock-picking at the Academy?

648
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:25,554
Real funny.

649
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:30,178
Commissioner Niemans.

650
01:01:31,683 --> 01:01:33,140
- Pierre Niemans?
- Yeah.

651
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:35,680
Sorry. Couldn't you say so?

652
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:38,678
- Why are you here?
- To see a suspect.

653
01:01:39,766 --> 01:01:40,880
What's his name?

654
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:42,551
Philip Sertys.

655
01:01:43,683 --> 01:01:44,796
Why?

656
01:01:46,266 --> 01:01:47,640
Pierre Niemans?

657
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:54,181
Great technique.

658
01:01:55,683 --> 01:01:57,140
What are you looking for?

659
01:02:01,766 --> 01:02:03,045
Don't touch anything.

660
01:02:03,641 --> 01:02:05,762
Chill out. Can I breathe at least?

661
01:02:10,266 --> 01:02:12,304
The guy's a real dog lover.

662
01:02:30,891 --> 01:02:31,969
Judith...

663
01:02:36,516 --> 01:02:39,051
we're talking total dog freak.

664
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:49,506
Wait.

665
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:53,431
What's the problem? Come on.

666
01:02:56,016 --> 01:02:57,805
I can't believe it.

667
01:02:57,806 --> 01:02:59,764
Mega-cop is scared of pooches.

668
01:03:01,558 --> 01:03:03,464
Don't worry. Come on.

669
01:03:03,465 --> 01:03:04,838
Come here, sonny.

670
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:07,046
Careful.

671
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:13,262
That one may bite.

672
01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:20,136
- You ever stop blabbing?
- Just joking.

673
01:03:22,974 --> 01:03:24,597
Motherfuckers.

674
01:03:32,224 --> 01:03:33,765
You know what this place is?

675
01:03:34,391 --> 01:03:38,431
The lab of a guy who experiments on dogs.

676
01:03:38,432 --> 01:03:41,389
Using genetics to make
a perfect fight dog.

677
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,299
He has all the equipment.

678
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:44,588
Look...

679
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:49,298
this is really gross.

680
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:51,593
Did you see?

681
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:55,130
Where are you going?

682
01:03:56,058 --> 01:03:57,337
Where are you going?

683
01:03:58,391 --> 01:04:00,049
To see your suspect.

684
01:04:00,558 --> 01:04:01,801
You know where he is?

685
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,556
So where are we going?

686
01:04:15,974 --> 01:04:17,550
What do you want Sertys for?

687
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:19,759
Desecration. And you?

688
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:23,178
Where?

689
01:04:23,766 --> 01:04:26,135
In Sarzac,
about 200 kilometers from here.

690
01:04:26,136 --> 01:04:27,635
Why do you want him?

691
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:29,130
Sarzac.

692
01:04:31,391 --> 01:04:32,848
Where's the lighter?

693
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:38,973
Do you never answer
questions or is it me?

694
01:04:43,558 --> 01:04:44,967
Take a left.

695
01:04:47,058 --> 01:04:49,428
Okay, Chief. I will take a left.

696
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:53,845
This will be a barrel of laughs.

697
01:04:56,433 --> 01:04:58,305
- Sir?
- He's with me.

698
01:04:58,849 --> 01:04:59,844
So?

699
01:05:00,516 --> 01:05:03,929
Same method of strangulation.
Same killer. I am sure.

700
01:05:04,224 --> 01:05:05,965
But this guy wasn't tortured.

701
01:05:05,966 --> 01:05:07,549
The hands aren't torture?

702
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,673
They were cut off after he died.

703
01:05:10,349 --> 01:05:11,842
I don't get a thing.

704
01:05:12,183 --> 01:05:15,181
What I don't get is why
he still has his eyes.

705
01:05:15,641 --> 01:05:17,547
- Did you start the autopsy?
- Not yet.

706
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:19,383
There are no wounds.

707
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:23,091
There must be some clue.

708
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:26,259
What kind of clue?

709
01:05:26,766 --> 01:05:29,930
I am not sure.
But I am sure it's here.

710
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:32,093
We have to look.

711
01:05:34,058 --> 01:05:35,219
Hold on...

712
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,722
tweezers, please.

713
01:06:10,058 --> 01:06:11,598
You won't believe this.

714
01:06:12,933 --> 01:06:16,179
Glass eyes. Like in an
eye doctor's office...

715
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,972
or at medical school.

716
01:06:20,308 --> 01:06:23,804
Get your men and meet me
at Cherneze's office.

717
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:25,964
Tell me what's going on.

718
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:27,931
You're asking me?

719
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,803
Can I know where you're going?

720
01:06:33,804 --> 01:06:36,260
Butt out. Wait for me at the station.

721
01:06:36,261 --> 01:06:39,595
You're kidding.
He's as much my witness as yours.

722
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:43,047
I didn't make it this far to
go back empty-handed.

723
01:06:43,048 --> 01:06:47,218
This isn't child's play.
I can't be your teacher.

724
01:06:47,516 --> 01:06:50,632
Stop acting like some
kind of living legend.

725
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:52,264
I can teach you, too.

726
01:06:52,265 --> 01:06:54,554
- I work alone.
- That makes two of us.

727
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:06,053
Where are we?

728
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:09,470
- Did you ever shoot someone?
- I never had to.

729
01:07:09,471 --> 01:07:11,056
Good. I want him alive.

730
01:07:11,057 --> 01:07:13,096
Who? Who, god damn it?

731
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:13,761
What the fuck is this?

732
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:26,425
What are we looking for?

733
01:08:41,308 --> 01:08:43,014
Can you tell me?

734
01:08:43,516 --> 01:08:46,087
If you talk to me, maybe I can help.

735
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:25,472
The other stairway.

736
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:03,928
Don't move.

737
01:10:44,766 --> 01:10:46,223
Run.

738
01:10:58,516 --> 01:10:59,546
What's happening?

739
01:12:32,308 --> 01:12:35,673
"I will track the source of
the crimson rivers."

740
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:40,930
Would it kill you
to tell me what's going on?

741
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:43,298
I have no idea.

742
01:12:44,558 --> 01:12:46,595
- That's an answer.
- So?

743
01:12:47,224 --> 01:12:49,973
So I am comparing the fingerprints.

744
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:56,014
There's no match.

745
01:12:56,849 --> 01:12:58,757
No criminal on our files.

746
01:12:59,058 --> 01:13:00,136
Shit.

747
01:13:00,558 --> 01:13:03,092
- Can you scan this print?
- No problem.

748
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:04,545
What's that?

749
01:13:05,099 --> 01:13:07,007
A girl who died 20 years ago.

750
01:13:08,474 --> 01:13:10,216
She led me here.

751
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:12,340
What?

752
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:16,342
If she died 20 years ago,
we got a problem.

753
01:13:16,343 --> 01:13:18,803
She's the one who shot at you.

754
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:23,259
These prints are a perfect match
with the ones on the gun...

755
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,174
except for the age difference.

756
01:13:27,266 --> 01:13:28,261
We need to talk.

757
01:13:29,308 --> 01:13:30,800
So we talk now?

758
01:13:34,474 --> 01:13:37,175
Last night, Sertys went to a cemetery.

759
01:13:37,176 --> 01:13:40,928
Into the vault of Judith Herault,
who died in 1982.

760
01:13:40,929 --> 01:13:45,424
He couldn't open the coffin, so he
tried misleading us with swastikas.

761
01:13:45,683 --> 01:13:48,845
That night, someone broke into
the elementary school...

762
01:13:48,846 --> 01:13:52,221
and stole pictures and documents
from '81 and '82...

763
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:56,008
the two years Judith Herault
attended that school.

764
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,054
She's one of these kids.

765
01:13:59,433 --> 01:14:00,973
How did she die?

766
01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:04,263
Run over by a truck.
They called it an accident.

767
01:14:04,264 --> 01:14:07,964
But the mother told me something
completely different.

768
01:14:08,183 --> 01:14:09,462
According to her...

769
01:14:10,433 --> 01:14:12,672
her daughter was killed by demons.

770
01:14:13,974 --> 01:14:15,218
Demons...

771
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:20,421
She has a major screw loose.
She's in a convent since.

772
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:24,762
But I got the impression she
wasn't telling me all...

773
01:14:24,763 --> 01:14:26,763
Did you grill her or have tea?

774
01:14:29,016 --> 01:14:31,302
I was investigating a misdemeanor.

775
01:14:31,303 --> 01:14:34,840
I couldn't punch her to get her to talk.
She's a nun.

776
01:14:36,058 --> 01:14:37,053
Your turn.

777
01:14:37,266 --> 01:14:39,173
Tell me what's going on.

778
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:43,303
It's a treasure hunt.
Each corpse leads to the next one.

779
01:14:46,224 --> 01:14:47,420
Let's say that...

780
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:51,592
Sertys, Callois and Cherneze
are linked by an incident...

781
01:14:51,593 --> 01:14:53,508
that happened 20 years ago.

782
01:14:54,016 --> 01:14:56,847
Two days ago they learn Callois is dead.

783
01:14:56,848 --> 01:14:58,509
We find the body.

784
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:01,213
They panic. The past resurfaces.

785
01:15:01,558 --> 01:15:04,046
They go to the cemetery and the school...

786
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:08,214
to check, to find something...

787
01:15:09,141 --> 01:15:10,089
But what?

788
01:15:12,724 --> 01:15:15,259
- If Judith is really dead.
- Why?

789
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:19,261
She's seeking revenge.
The nun probably faked her death.

790
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:20,928
And the prints?

791
01:15:21,891 --> 01:15:23,846
Fingers can be cut off.

792
01:15:24,099 --> 01:15:26,386
The guy who shot at me had five fingers.

793
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:30,807
Why did he let you live?

794
01:15:31,474 --> 01:15:33,631
So I'd understand his vengeance.

795
01:15:34,974 --> 01:15:36,930
What links the three victims?

796
01:15:37,641 --> 01:15:39,678
Callois was head librarian.

797
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:44,257
Sertys worked in the maternity ward.
Cherneze worked with the dean.

798
01:15:44,258 --> 01:15:46,305
It all leads to the university.

799
01:15:48,308 --> 01:15:49,338
I better get back.

800
01:15:50,558 --> 01:15:51,671
What about me?

801
01:15:51,891 --> 01:15:53,597
See if Judith is dead.

802
01:15:53,891 --> 01:15:55,597
I knew you'd say that.

803
01:15:56,933 --> 01:15:58,260
I get the fun stuff.

804
01:16:08,058 --> 01:16:09,883
Call me with any news.

805
01:16:21,224 --> 01:16:22,966
What are you doing here?

806
01:16:23,891 --> 01:16:26,131
Your colleagues held me for four hours.

807
01:16:26,641 --> 01:16:29,390
Sorry. Everyone's on edge.

808
01:16:30,391 --> 01:16:31,090
Want a ride?

809
01:16:32,766 --> 01:16:33,928
Sure.

810
01:17:05,849 --> 01:17:07,639
So Cherneze is dead, too?

811
01:17:08,099 --> 01:17:09,509
Did you know him?

812
01:17:10,349 --> 01:17:12,423
One of the college's last dinosaurs.

813
01:17:14,058 --> 01:17:18,051
You don't seem to appreciate
the geniuses you live among.

814
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,589
I don't respect intellectuals much.

815
01:17:22,724 --> 01:17:24,798
Weren't your parents professors?

816
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:28,590
I don't respect my parents much.

817
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:30,342
Take a left here.

818
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:53,092
Is anyone expecting you?

819
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:56,964
You're a lousy Don Juan.

820
01:17:57,599 --> 01:17:58,713
- Thanks.
- No problem.

821
01:19:42,099 --> 01:19:43,426
Nice place.

822
01:19:44,183 --> 01:19:46,338
I like it. It's far from everything.

823
01:19:46,339 --> 01:19:48,470
No TV, no radio...

824
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:50,596
even cell phones don't work.

825
01:19:51,308 --> 01:19:52,635
A grenade?

826
01:19:53,474 --> 01:19:54,422
Thanks.

827
01:19:55,058 --> 01:19:57,381
I use them to trigger avalanches.

828
01:20:01,099 --> 01:20:02,722
Are all the locals like you?

829
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:07,755
Battling mountains
helps forge your character.

830
01:20:10,599 --> 01:20:11,796
Same goes for cops.

831
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:14,889
Have you been one for long?

832
01:20:16,974 --> 01:20:18,254
Too long.

833
01:20:21,891 --> 01:20:23,265
Buy lighter fluid.

834
01:20:25,849 --> 01:20:26,963
I should.

835
01:20:27,641 --> 01:20:30,473
But I am trying to quit. It was a gift.

836
01:20:30,891 --> 01:20:31,969
From your ex?

837
01:20:35,558 --> 01:20:37,762
I never got married. How about you?

838
01:20:38,683 --> 01:20:40,555
Almost. With the Dean's son.

839
01:20:42,474 --> 01:20:44,015
That could never work.

840
01:20:45,724 --> 01:20:47,549
It sure was intended to.

841
01:20:49,058 --> 01:20:52,754
After three years face to face
in a reading room...

842
01:20:52,755 --> 01:20:54,348
you get close.

843
01:20:56,891 --> 01:20:59,214
Why do you hate the school so much?

844
01:20:59,808 --> 01:21:01,929
Why do you suspect me?

845
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,932
You climb mountains.

846
01:21:05,766 --> 01:21:09,096
You found the first body,
helped me find the second.

847
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:12,972
You're the perfect suspect.

848
01:21:14,974 --> 01:21:16,431
Except for one thing.

849
01:21:16,432 --> 01:21:17,512
What?

850
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:20,135
You're incapable...

851
01:21:20,136 --> 01:21:23,389
of strangling someone for 10 minutes,
eye to eye.

852
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:30,135
I have to go.

853
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,640
Thanks for the tea.

854
01:22:34,308 --> 01:22:35,338
Hello.

855
01:22:36,599 --> 01:22:38,804
Tell me about Remy Callois's thesis.

856
01:22:42,058 --> 01:22:44,178
He talks about the myth of Olympus...

857
01:22:44,179 --> 01:22:47,300
Greek athletes
who combined mind and body.

858
01:22:48,016 --> 01:22:52,968
He refers a lot
to the Berlin Olympic games of 1936...

859
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:56,968
when German athletes fueled
Nazi propaganda.

860
01:22:56,969 --> 01:22:58,302
And "crimson rivers"?

861
01:22:58,303 --> 01:23:00,844
Flow with the blood of perfect men.

862
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,260
Blood?

863
01:23:04,724 --> 01:23:05,755
Veins...

864
01:23:07,058 --> 01:23:07,804
Commissioner.

865
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:10,299
You want my opinion?

866
01:23:10,808 --> 01:23:15,215
Seriously, his thesis
is a potpourri of Nazi crap.

867
01:23:15,216 --> 01:23:18,672
At the end, it's like
"How To Be a Perfect Fascist".

868
01:23:18,673 --> 01:23:22,013
He explains how to create
the perfect man today.

869
01:23:22,766 --> 01:23:23,382
How?

870
01:23:23,383 --> 01:23:27,006
By combining brawny kids
with brainy ones.

871
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:30,219
By selecting them and marrying them.

872
01:23:31,349 --> 01:23:32,890
It's called...

873
01:23:33,683 --> 01:23:34,464
eugenics.

874
01:23:34,465 --> 01:23:36,263
Eugenics, that's it.

875
01:23:36,264 --> 01:23:39,715
Like Nazis tried in some villages
during the war.

876
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:44,049
Like at this school. Healthy minds...

877
01:23:44,641 --> 01:23:46,182
in healthy bodies.

878
01:24:21,016 --> 01:24:23,966
What are you doing?
You have no business here.

879
01:24:23,967 --> 01:24:26,546
What role did Callois play exactly?

880
01:24:27,516 --> 01:24:28,429
Excuse me?

881
01:24:29,391 --> 01:24:32,887
Callois. Sertys. Cherneze.

882
01:24:33,183 --> 01:24:34,462
It all leads here.

883
01:24:36,724 --> 01:24:38,715
What are you after?

884
01:24:39,016 --> 01:24:40,888
You suspect us, don't you?

885
01:24:42,308 --> 01:24:44,631
Victims can be guilty, too.

886
01:24:45,224 --> 01:24:46,883
Watch what you say, Niemans.

887
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:51,131
I inquired about you.
You're on the razor's edge...

888
01:24:52,266 --> 01:24:54,884
I'd gladly put you first on the list.

889
01:24:54,885 --> 01:24:59,346
All that's stopping me is the desire
to prove you're behind it all.

890
01:24:59,347 --> 01:25:01,590
Am I wrong? Am I?

891
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:06,588
Stop it.

892
01:25:07,224 --> 01:25:08,551
Are you crazy?

893
01:25:13,599 --> 01:25:15,222
You will be hearing from me.

894
01:25:17,933 --> 01:25:20,256
Can't I leave you alone for a minute?

895
01:25:24,224 --> 01:25:26,132
What did you find in the tomb?

896
01:25:27,808 --> 01:25:30,178
I don't know if it will be any help.

897
01:25:42,224 --> 01:25:43,421
It's not her.

898
01:25:44,683 --> 01:25:45,926
You know her?

899
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:49,513
- She helped with the case.
- She helped you?

900
01:25:49,514 --> 01:25:52,764
To understand the meaning
of the "crimson rivers".

901
01:25:54,058 --> 01:25:56,889
They have lived in a closed circuit here
for ages.

902
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:01,139
Inbreeding led the professors
to start having degenerate kids.

903
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:03,546
So they needed new blood.

904
01:26:03,547 --> 01:26:05,050
New blood?

905
01:26:05,051 --> 01:26:08,885
In the maternity wing,
they replace professors' kids...

906
01:26:08,886 --> 01:26:11,890
with healthy newborn mountain babies.

907
01:26:13,224 --> 01:26:16,471
Sertys's father exchanged Fanny
with Judith?

908
01:26:16,724 --> 01:26:18,347
And plenty of others.

909
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:20,175
What for?

910
01:26:20,516 --> 01:26:22,174
To create a superior race.

911
01:26:25,141 --> 01:26:26,255
Nazis?

912
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,759
- A freaking Nazi college?
- Not a college.

913
01:26:31,974 --> 01:26:33,550
A breeding ground.

914
01:26:44,391 --> 01:26:45,386
Who the fuck is it?

915
01:26:54,141 --> 01:26:55,550
Shoot.

916
01:27:02,058 --> 01:27:03,385
Shoot.

917
01:27:06,974 --> 01:27:08,217
It's bullet-proof.

918
01:27:08,218 --> 01:27:10,181
Aim for the same spot.

919
01:27:10,683 --> 01:27:11,761
Go on, shoot.

920
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:13,138
Shoot.

921
01:27:14,224 --> 01:27:15,054
Watch out.

922
01:28:56,308 --> 01:28:57,386
Are you okay?

923
01:29:06,724 --> 01:29:08,596
- Who's this bastard?
- The Dean's son.

924
01:29:10,183 --> 01:29:11,178
What did he want?

925
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:14,133
To stop us from knowing
what they did to Fanny.

926
01:29:14,134 --> 01:29:17,637
What could he do to Fanny?
He was 10 back then.

927
01:29:17,638 --> 01:29:21,635
He was exchanged.
He was seated with Fanny at the library.

928
01:29:21,636 --> 01:29:24,840
He should have married her.
That was the plan.

929
01:29:24,841 --> 01:29:27,888
So then why is she killing them all off?

930
01:29:27,889 --> 01:29:30,386
She refuses to play by their rules.

931
01:29:35,391 --> 01:29:36,765
You think she's innocent?

932
01:29:49,808 --> 01:29:51,005
My coat.

933
01:29:59,516 --> 01:30:02,467
Hold on. A la Niemans.

934
01:30:19,516 --> 01:30:22,680
Who is this babe of yours?
Lady Cliff-hanger?

935
01:30:54,599 --> 01:30:55,796
Shit.

936
01:31:04,683 --> 01:31:06,223
Are you still not sure?

937
01:31:06,974 --> 01:31:08,882
To think she brought me here.

938
01:31:09,641 --> 01:31:11,431
I could have seen it all.

939
01:31:12,308 --> 01:31:14,713
She could have operated on you, too.

940
01:31:16,308 --> 01:31:18,014
She didn't want to kill me.

941
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:20,633
She left me alive.

942
01:31:21,724 --> 01:31:23,680
What are you talking about?

943
01:31:25,474 --> 01:31:28,555
She left you alive,
but three other guys didn't make it.

944
01:31:28,556 --> 01:31:32,007
Your girlfriend's hobby is
to cut up her boyfriends.

945
01:31:32,266 --> 01:31:33,343
Why the treasure hunt?

946
01:31:33,344 --> 01:31:37,889
What are you talking about?
She's a schizoid. A psycho-killer.

947
01:31:38,849 --> 01:31:40,508
She wants us to understand.

948
01:31:41,183 --> 01:31:43,932
- What's to understand?
- She wants to get caught.

949
01:31:47,433 --> 01:31:49,968
Good news. That's our job, right?

950
01:31:50,849 --> 01:31:52,556
Now we just have to find her.

951
01:31:54,349 --> 01:31:56,139
That's our job.

952
01:32:13,141 --> 01:32:14,598
What now?

953
01:32:15,308 --> 01:32:16,716
She took the grenades.

954
01:32:16,717 --> 01:32:18,053
What grenades?

955
01:32:20,683 --> 01:32:23,171
Closed up like a fucking clam...

956
01:32:44,516 --> 01:32:46,056
Did you evacuate the college?

957
01:32:46,057 --> 01:32:48,297
I need an explanation first.

958
01:32:48,298 --> 01:32:51,638
It's not the time for explanations.
Evacuate.

959
01:32:52,308 --> 01:32:54,298
This can't go on. Who's up there?

960
01:32:55,099 --> 01:32:57,385
- I go alone.
- It's everyone or no one.

961
01:32:57,386 --> 01:32:59,050
I am going alone.

962
01:32:59,641 --> 01:33:00,919
Everyone, freeze.

963
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:01,887
Calm down...

964
01:33:01,888 --> 01:33:03,425
No one is coming.

965
01:33:04,058 --> 01:33:05,431
Have you gone berserk?

966
01:33:05,432 --> 01:33:06,345
Give me that.

967
01:33:09,308 --> 01:33:10,884
Trust me.

968
01:33:21,391 --> 01:33:22,670
Lower your guns.

969
01:34:00,058 --> 01:34:02,048
We have to go all the way now.

970
01:34:05,516 --> 01:34:06,973
Leave her to me.

971
01:34:30,349 --> 01:34:31,511
Down there.

972
01:34:44,558 --> 01:34:46,347
Fanny, turn around.

973
01:34:47,016 --> 01:34:48,178
Come down.

974
01:34:51,183 --> 01:34:54,097
This is the end. It's over now.

975
01:34:54,683 --> 01:34:56,174
I know who you are.

976
01:34:56,175 --> 01:34:57,592
You know nothing.

977
01:34:57,593 --> 01:35:00,680
Stop it. I know what they did to you.

978
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:02,804
Exchanging newborn babies.

979
01:35:02,805 --> 01:35:05,006
Killing kids. I know.

980
01:35:05,007 --> 01:35:08,014
It's too late.
You can't help. Go away.

981
01:35:08,015 --> 01:35:11,678
You led me here. I can't turn back.

982
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,886
- Neither can I.
- Don't do that.

983
01:35:13,887 --> 01:35:17,512
They will close down the college.
They're all dead now.

984
01:35:18,058 --> 01:35:21,174
- You will kill innocent people.
- They're all guilty.

985
01:35:27,474 --> 01:35:28,801
No one is innocent.

986
01:35:30,849 --> 01:35:31,631
Judith?

987
01:35:33,766 --> 01:35:34,880
Twins.

988
01:35:35,808 --> 01:35:37,300
They exchanged twins.

989
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:38,671
Just one.

990
01:35:39,099 --> 01:35:41,932
That's why her face was a threat to them.

991
01:35:42,933 --> 01:35:44,260
Take care of her.

992
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:48,927
So who died in the car accident?

993
01:35:48,928 --> 01:35:50,924
What about the fingerprint?

994
01:35:52,058 --> 01:35:53,301
Mommy prepared it all.

995
01:35:53,849 --> 01:35:55,923
The other girl was already dead.

996
01:35:56,266 --> 01:35:58,173
Mommy planned everything.

997
01:35:58,849 --> 01:36:00,886
Except your going haywire.

998
01:36:00,887 --> 01:36:02,129
You thought you'd make it?

999
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:03,965
I don't intend to make it.

1000
01:36:03,966 --> 01:36:06,630
Freeze, or you really won't make it.

1001
01:36:08,891 --> 01:36:09,388
Stop.

1002
01:36:09,724 --> 01:36:10,470
Leave her alone.

1003
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:14,465
I will trigger an avalanche.

1004
01:36:15,849 --> 01:36:16,928
Listen to me.

1005
01:36:17,391 --> 01:36:18,172
Stay away.

1006
01:36:18,173 --> 01:36:23,090
The men who hurt you are all dead.
If you do this, they will win.

1007
01:36:35,558 --> 01:36:37,429
Only you can stop her, Fanny.

1008
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:41,463
You're not a monster like her.
Stop before it's too late.

1009
01:36:42,558 --> 01:36:44,346
- I have no choice.
- You do.

1010
01:36:44,347 --> 01:36:45,096
Stop.

1011
01:36:51,058 --> 01:36:51,970
Kill him.

1012
01:36:58,683 --> 01:37:01,171
For our lives.
For those of our parents.

1013
01:37:01,558 --> 01:37:04,224
For the lives they stole from us.

1014
01:37:06,474 --> 01:37:07,304
Kill him.

1015
01:37:07,305 --> 01:37:09,216
- Not him. He's innocent.
- Kill him.

1016
01:37:11,683 --> 01:37:14,715
Do it for me.
For the life I never had.

1017
01:37:14,716 --> 01:37:16,797
A life in your shadow.

1018
01:37:16,798 --> 01:37:21,139
They created you.
And they rejected me. Do it.

1019
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:22,505
Kill him, Fanny.

1020
01:37:23,641 --> 01:37:24,257
Do it.

1021
01:37:25,974 --> 01:37:28,048
You wanted him to understand.

1022
01:37:28,849 --> 01:37:30,176
You can't do that.

1023
01:37:31,349 --> 01:37:32,925
It's you and me.

1024
01:37:33,224 --> 01:37:34,172
You and me.

1025
01:37:37,058 --> 01:37:37,887
Go on.

1026
01:37:40,141 --> 01:37:40,922
Go on.

1027
01:37:42,058 --> 01:37:43,136
Don't.

1028
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:45,386
You're not like her.

1029
01:37:45,808 --> 01:37:46,756
But I am.

1030
01:37:46,757 --> 01:37:47,762
Kill him.

1031
01:37:48,808 --> 01:37:49,423
Do it.

1032
01:37:59,391 --> 01:38:02,057
You had to understand,
so no one could forget.

1033
01:38:02,058 --> 01:38:04,132
I know.

1034
01:38:15,766 --> 01:38:16,844
Hurry.

1035
01:39:00,516 --> 01:39:01,678
Take her feet.

1036
01:40:58,099 --> 01:40:59,758
That's enough. I am fine.

1037
01:41:00,599 --> 01:41:02,092
Thanks, doggy. That's enough.

1038
01:41:03,016 --> 01:41:03,680
I have had it.

1039
01:41:07,224 --> 01:41:08,800
Can I ask a question?

1040
01:41:13,641 --> 01:41:15,632
What do you have against dogs?

1041
01:41:21,058 --> 01:41:22,432
It was a long time ago...

1042
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:19,000
