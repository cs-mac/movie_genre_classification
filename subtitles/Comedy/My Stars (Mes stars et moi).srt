1
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,955
Morning, Anita.

2
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,036
Good morning.

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,038
- Mr Robert!
- Théodore.

4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,798
Worked all night again?

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,876
There you go.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,159
Can I see that one?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,274
What's all this?

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,233
I wasn't aware.
He's not her kind.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,713
She's ruining her image.

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,558
I'll take this too.

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,714
See you tomorrow.

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,273
Take it easy!

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,355
There you go.

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,989
- Another preview tonight?
- You got it.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,077
Which actress this time?

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,829
- Solange Duvivier.
- lsn't he the lucky one!

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,837
Any chance of a photo?

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,439
He'll try!

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,394
"Duvivier's boredom
is for all to see!"

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,348
You're speaking
of France's top actress!

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,357
You get paid more to be nasty?

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,393
That's twice this year,
there was April already.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,990
Well it's twice too much,
we'll not let this rest!

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,631
Heard of the dog and the lamppost?

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,196
Like the artist and the critic:
one shines, the other pisses.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,311
Do me a favour, piss off!

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,709
Violette...

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,555
Stéphane Bertrand, please.

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,314
No, give me his voicemail.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,957
I'm calling about the screen test
for Violette Duval,

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,434
Wednesday at 1 0.

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,916
We're cancelling,
the role's too minor.

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,429
Plus, it's TV,
she wants to do more cinema.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,596
Sorry, she's not interested.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,749
Adeline...

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,232
Of course I want to go.

37
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,552
Where? At the school?
What time?

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,994
I can't tonight,
it's Solange's preview.

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,719
Don't take it like that.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,071
Of course my daughter matters,
but tonight is out.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,639
We can go see her teachers,
one by one.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,031
But tonight, I really can't.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,149
Good evening.

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,114
Presenting a new film
is always very moving.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,030
I'd like to thank my director,
Jean Belair,

46
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,669
my producer, Charles Dassault

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,475
and the whole crew
for a job well done.

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,990
Someone else I'd like to thank,

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,110
who is by my side daily,

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,711
as friend, advisor
and of course my agent,

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,275
Dominique Bhé.

52
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,512
Thank you, Dominique.

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,312
Enjoy the film.

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,116
Solange!

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,309
Solange!

56
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,277
MY STARS

57
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,789
Morning, Anita.

58
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,909
I'm nervous every time,
aren't you?

59
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,872
No, not me.

60
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,639
Who's your agent?

61
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,672
- Dominique Bhé.
- Wow!

62
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,154
You're so lucky.

63
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,954
Mine's useless.
The bare minimum.

64
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,550
Think Dominique is taking on?

65
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,676
No, I don't think so.

66
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,188
Marie, your turn.

67
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,077
Marie Janson, welcome!
How's your dad?

68
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,117
So who's your dad?

69
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,036
See you round.

70
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,310
Ciao, sweetie!

71
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,994
Bye, darling.

72
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,994
Hello!

73
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,993
Violette Duval?

74
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,719
What brings you here?

75
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,228
The screen test.

76
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,839
What an honour.

77
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,508
Should've rolled out the red carpet!

78
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,280
Missed the plane for Hollywood?

79
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,037
Sorry?

80
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,789
No TV, just cinema.
Think you're Solange Duvivier?

81
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,439
I never said that.

82
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,869
Mélanie, your turn.

83
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,990
I don't get it...

84
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,033
Well, get this.
The Oscars are that way!

85
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,674
Goodbye.
Give my regards to Spielberg.

86
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,512
I must be dreaming!

87
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,231
He's of Gipsy origin.

88
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,670
There's a new centre in Bucharest.

89
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,316
His parents left him
at the gate with a note.

90
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,078
He's almost two.

91
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,438
Bravo for the association.

92
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,993
I really admire you.
I wouldn't be able.

93
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,915
We're ready,
whenever you are.

94
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,876
His name's Augustin,
like my dad.

95
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,479
Must be an omen, no?

96
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,594
Think you'll go?

97
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,118
Got to talk to Bruno.

98
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,751
Hi, gorgeous!

99
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,518
Got the adoption photos.

100
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,508
He's so cute!
When do we go?

101
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,512
What's the rush?
Let's think about it.

102
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,678
We're both busy,
it's not the right time.

103
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,632
So when's the right time?

104
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,471
Let's discuss it, I gotta go.

105
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,195
Big kiss.

106
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,551
Let's say he's progressing.

107
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,275
As my Gran used to say: "Men
are crabs, they walk backwards!"

108
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,033
Was she a philosopher?

109
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,798
No, a fishwife!

110
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,679
IT'S LOVE!

111
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,719
Can I have a word?

112
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,750
No autographs.

113
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,598
It's about lsabelle.

114
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,869
No interviews.

115
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,718
- I'm not press.
- Then who?

116
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,480
Isabelle told me all about you.

117
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,671
I don't get it, who are you?

118
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,879
She never mentioned me?

119
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,311
No.

120
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,636
She never told you?
Not a word?

121
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,994
My mistake, I'd presumed that...

122
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,997
Sorry, doesn't matter.

123
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,518
Hold on!
What's all this about?

124
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,872
If lsabelle never told you,
it's not up to me.

125
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,789
Let's say...

126
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,478
It's kind of delicate.

127
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,835
Thank you.

128
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,710
You're off to Formentera
next weekend,

129
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,039
but I've a surprise for her
so could we switch?

130
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,755
"Switch"? I don't get it.

131
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,518
I thought that...

132
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,110
she'd already told you about us.

133
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,874
About "us"?

134
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,233
I don't mind

135
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,079
her seeing other men,
but next weekend...

136
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,838
You are dating lsabelle?

137
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,679
A rather simplistic view
of our relationship...

138
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,108
But yes, I am.

139
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,958
You and lsabelle!

140
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,270
Surprising, but she's so discreet.

141
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,277
She says she's seeing her agent.

142
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,358
You're sick. Really sick!

143
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,631
Let's drop this whole thing.

144
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,236
We're in Berlin the weekend after,

145
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,431
I'll surprise her then.

146
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,838
Don't tell her we spoke,

147
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,917
I'll tell her myself
tomorrow night.

148
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,349
Tomorrow night?

149
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,437
At Fouquet's.
Never been?

150
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,388
A pity, it's tops.

151
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,397
My apologies.
This is on me.

152
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
Hold on, not so fast.
Let's sort this out.

153
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,555
Sit back down.

154
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,429
Sit down.

155
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,992
I was wondering if Formentera

156
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,158
could be put off
till the weekend after?

157
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,759
Sure, no problem.

158
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,678
See you later, big kiss.

159
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,877
Here.

160
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,109
Yes, Bruno?

161
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,232
Sorry, I forgot.
That weekend I'm in Berlin.

162
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,596
Berlin?

163
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,595
Yes, at the festival,
with my agent.

164
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,959
You free tomorrow night?

165
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,952
I think we need to talk.

166
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,754
Tomorrow night...

167
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,639
No, I'm dining out.

168
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,909
With your agent?

169
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,156
- At Fouquet's?
- How did you guess?

170
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,713
Never mind, I get it.

171
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,194
You get what?

172
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,470
That we're through.
I'm nobody's fool.

173
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,195
Have fun, my regards to your agent.

174
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,598
Think I just got the shove.

175
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,359
The shove?

176
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,275
Well he is a rugby-player!

177
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,678
Sorry, not funny.

178
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,309
Victor!

179
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,154
Hi, Victor.

180
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,994
What a preview!
I was so happy for her.

181
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,189
The film's wonderful!

182
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,594
What do you want?

183
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,711
That article in Cinémagazine.

184
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,918
She must have right of reply.

185
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,112
I'll give you right of reply.
Beat it!

186
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,311
Hey, don't take it like that!

187
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,670
I'm saying this for her.

188
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,593
Asshole!

189
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,793
Sorry about the racket.
It's that fan again.

190
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,189
What does he want now?

191
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,470
Sticking his nose in, as usual.

192
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,079
You haven't eaten.

193
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,077
Not hungry.
You say I've put on weight.

194
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,713
That's just it.

195
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,953
You don't breakfast,
then you nibble all day.

196
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,033
You've a busy schedule.

197
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,755
Press conference at noon,
interviews from two till four,

198
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,030
photo session till five-thirty

199
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
and the gala evening
starts at eight-thirty.

200
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,673
Do I have to go?

201
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,395
It's in your honour.
For the retrospective.

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,989
Retrospective?
I'm not even dead.

203
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,713
Got anything more boring?

204
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,309
The Minister for Culture
will be there.

205
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,511
I knew you'd come up trumps!

206
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,516
I think I'd prefer the red silk one
with the crew neck.

207
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,713
They repainted the press room,
this will be much better.

208
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,916
He seems to be coming more often.

209
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,348
We must do something.

210
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,312
Like me to take care of it?

211
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,795
No, he's a leech, but harmless.

212
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,837
RESERVED FOR
ClNÉMAGAZlNE STAFF

213
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,158
It's not normal behaviour.
I know there's a problem.

214
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,151
It wasn't always so,
but since my wife and daughter left

215
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,954
it's got worse,
I don't know what to do.

216
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,316
I thought it best to see someone.

217
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,238
You did right, Mr Pelage.

218
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,591
So JR, what's up?

219
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,396
He's become a couch potato.

220
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,757
I'm so busy, I can't cope.

221
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,039
He watches cookery on TV,

222
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,753
the Gourmet channel.

223
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,675
Interesting.

224
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,350
TV soothes feline anxiety,
it's been proven.

225
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,518
But he eats like a horse.

226
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,591
Buy low-cal, he's too fat.

227
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,153
It's too expensive.

228
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,318
You can't have it every way.

229
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,990
Your pet's health is at stake,
he could get diabetes.

230
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,718
He's in depression.

231
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,194
Needs a psy-cat-analyst.

232
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,795
A what?

233
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,989
A shrink for cats.

234
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,589
- That exists?
- Sure, we all have neuroses.

235
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,194
Why not your cat?

236
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,597
The actresses carry the film.

237
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,711
Three women with the same secret

238
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,193
who overcome their differences
to pull together.

239
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,916
I wrote the lead role
for Solange Duvivier.

240
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,388
But for the other two

241
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,558
I wanted the opinion
of a man who knows.

242
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,230
Thank you for your trust.

243
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,953
I'll read it right away.

244
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,593
Call Nathalie,
cancel dinner tonight.

245
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,553
There's a problem
on Béatrice's shoot.

246
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,274
Who messed up my photos?

247
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,236
Who's this kid? She's pretty.

248
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,230
Is she with us?

249
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,670
Yes, I think Fabien handles her.

250
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,752
Makes a nice trio.

251
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,519
Was this your idea?

252
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,031
You'll go places!

253
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,431
I'll call Patrice.

254
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,153
I'm sure he'll love it.

255
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,275
Get me Patrice Leduc, please.

256
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,636
Fish, we know,
but Connétable sardines?

257
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,559
Connétable sardines in olive oil
on fresh bread.

258
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,275
Nothing better!

259
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,948
Connétable for connoisseurs!

260
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,509
Three in math.

261
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,154
Lucie, your mom's right,
it's not on!

262
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,952
Algebra sucks, I don't care!

263
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,910
Well I do.

264
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,230
I never studied,
I made my own way.

265
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,358
Think I like cleaning?

266
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,835
You can do better.

267
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,759
Like being an actress!

268
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,393
Yeah, very funny.

269
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,950
Starring in the new
Patrice Leduc film will be

270
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,434
Solange Duvivier,

271
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,359
Isabelle Séréna,
and newcomer Violette Duval...

272
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,999
He chose them?

273
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,839
All three of them!

274
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,155
Amazing!

275
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,518
I'd really like
to go to art school.

276
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,515
But Mom is against the idea.

277
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,836
And you?

278
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,997
Yeah, why not.

279
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,595
Think I've got talent?

280
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,872
That I'd make the grade?

281
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,549
Yeah, why not.

282
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,231
'Cos otherwise, I could do porn.

283
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,953
They want babes for a video.

284
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,674
Starts with a gang-bang
and ends in a zoo.

285
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,869
Cool, no?

286
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,118
Yeah, why not.

287
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,468
- What's up?
- I'm leaving!

288
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,669
Car or bus?

289
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,677
We're eating,
why leave now?

290
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,517
Why not!

291
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,356
Hi, Mom.

292
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,075
Hi, sweetie.

293
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,233
- Bye.
- Bye, darling.

294
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,995
- Hi.
- What's up this time?

295
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,269
Heck, I don't know.

296
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,392
Things were fine,
then she stormed out!

297
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,989
I think she's in teenage crisis.

298
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,238
Do you two talk enough?

299
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,189
Robert...

300
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,397
Durand is to head
a subsidiary down south.

301
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,989
He's asked me to be his PA.

302
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,835
I don't believe it!

303
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,315
That guy's always
had his eye on you...

304
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,112
I said I'd think about it.

305
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,913
You can't leave.

306
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,554
You can't do that.

307
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,552
We're separated, Robert.

308
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,557
Not even married. Remember?

309
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,514
But we said we were separating...

310
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,948
to think things over.

311
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,674
That it was temporary,
just for a while.

312
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,989
It may be for a bit longer.

313
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,153
You never forgave me
for taking that job.

314
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,072
When Cleanhouse closed
you could've set up your own firm,

315
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,193
but you took a night-job
at the bottom of the ladder.

316
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,515
And for what?

317
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,037
To be near your actresses.

318
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,795
Give me a little time
before you answer.

319
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,714
Please.

320
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,399
I made an appointment
at Lucie's school.

321
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,479
You can count on me,
I'll be there.

322
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,551
Fine.

323
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,594
Like your fringe,
makes a nice change.

324
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,150
Thanks.

325
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,476
Had it done two months ago.

326
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,354
Goodnight.

327
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,915
Hello.

328
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,196
The plumber.

329
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,469
And your name is?

330
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,353
Got a call for the water
in the dressing rooms.

331
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,790
My location manager's not here yet.

332
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,194
Fine, don't need him...

333
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,197
Sorry, I can't let you in.

334
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,436
Access is for crew only.

335
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,471
Your manager asked me to come.

336
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,835
Mister...

337
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,837
A name ending in "a"... or "i".

338
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,950
Mr Emmanuelli?

339
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,997
Right! It was urgent.

340
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,510
Sure, but I have strict orders.
He won't be long, if you...

341
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,629
But I have other clients waiting.

342
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,356
So, what do we do?

343
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,198
I don't know.

344
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,632
Fine, I'll come back later.
But I have to bill the visit.

345
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,711
1 50 euros... Fine by me.
Won't be docked from my pay.

346
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,795
First time on set?

347
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,588
Good start.
Emmanuelli will love it.

348
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,752
- He's Corsican, no?
- Right.

349
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,835
Hold on! Will it take long?

350
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,951
Nice, but we'll have
to move the hydrant.

351
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,550
Perfect,
whenever the actresses are ready.

352
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,197
If you need anything, just ask.

353
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,550
Thank you.
You're very kind.

354
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,874
So, then...

355
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,514
"Good luck on this new shoot.
Your biggest fan, Robert"

356
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,353
Her valuables were at risk!

357
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,677
I know, but that trainee is a dork!

358
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,871
I'll step up the security.

359
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,833
We had leeches in the past,
but he beats all!

360
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,549
Sorry I'm late.

361
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,557
Good day, Solange. Hello.

362
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,559
It's outrageous!
A fan got into my trailer.

363
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,750
Wow! Thought I was the only one.

364
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,554
That was always your problem.

365
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,832
I've the same fan as you.
That's wild!

366
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,234
Mr Pelage.

367
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,392
Sorry, he's sulking.
It's our first visit

368
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,995
to a psy-cat-analyst.

369
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,077
No, "zoo-psychiatrist".

370
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,313
I don't analyse animals
on a couch.

371
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,278
I just try to understand

372
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,631
and treat
the behavioural problems of cats.

373
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,551
So, name and date of birth, please.

374
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,913
Pelage, Robert.
27 March, 1 964.

375
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,234
No, I meant your pet.

376
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,430
Of course.

377
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,715
Sorry.

378
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,508
JR was born January 1 2, 1 999.

379
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,599
- JR is written "J"
- "R", thank you.

380
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,319
Dr Mulot mentioned depression.

381
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,558
For how long?

382
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,430
For the past few months.

383
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,875
Yes?

384
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,274
Since my wife and daughter left.

385
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,316
Yes?

386
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,239
We've separated,
but it's temporary.

387
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,159
To think things over.

388
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,392
Cats are very prone
to separation anxiety.

389
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,631
Was he close to your wife?

390
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,239
Yes, very close.

391
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,998
Early on, they were...

392
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,639
inseparable.

393
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,595
I see.

394
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,231
Have you tried speaking?

395
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,000
In such cases
it's crucial to verbalise.

396
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,195
I've tried, but she says
she needs space...

397
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,311
No, I meant JR.

398
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,675
Sorry. Of course.

399
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,796
Right.

400
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,793
First off,
I'll do some clinical tests

401
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,037
to see what treatment
I can suggest.

402
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,073
Sometimes, we have
to resort to medicine.

403
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,391
Tranquillizers...

404
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,348
But be warned,

405
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,552
medicine alone won't do.

406
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,189
Cure really depends
on your behaviour.

407
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,597
At first, it didn't bother me
but now he's always hovering.

408
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,916
Victor will blow a fuse.

409
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,874
It began with my series.
I was so proud to have a fan.

410
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,718
Now I find it a pain.

411
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,798
He's everywhere.
I might find him in my bed.

412
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,353
Or in the queue.

413
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,319
Sorry?

414
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,030
I changed number twice,
but he found it each time.

415
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,798
He even got into our trailers.

416
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,638
What next?
Our living rooms?

417
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,114
We must do something.

418
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,390
But what?

419
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,635
The police.

420
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,676
No point.
Without a crime, they're powerless.

421
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,075
Not if we file a complaint.

422
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,759
They can't lock him up.

423
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,635
They can restrain him.
If I must, I'll call Nicolas.

424
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,432
Security is his thing.

425
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,312
So the press chimes in? No!

426
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,518
- Shouldn't bother you.
- Meaning?

427
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,638
You're already front page.

428
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,190
More for your ass
than your movies...

429
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,231
You know what my ass says?

430
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,193
No, but I know what it does.
Overtime.

431
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,358
Maybe watch your own ass.
It needs work.

432
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,158
I don't flash it around.

433
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,231
No one wants to see it!

434
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,358
So what about the police?

435
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,432
It's easiest, I'm in favour.

436
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,798
Do as you like.
I'm telling you, it's pointless.

437
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,159
Me too, I'm in favour.

438
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,595
Robert Pelage?

439
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,950
Lieutenant Bart.
I'd like a word.

440
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,953
Captain, I can't believe it!

441
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,959
I'm just a Lieutenant.

442
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,436
I admire them, support them,
I go to no ends!

443
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,029
- Maybe you overdo it?
- No, love has no limits.

444
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,468
They want you to stop.

445
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,877
You'll have to cool it.
They filed a complaint.

446
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,230
This is serious.

447
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,918
Took it for a cushion.

448
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,719
Even Violette, you say?

449
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,793
Didn't she win the César award?

450
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,479
No, that was lsabelle.

451
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,671
Sorry, movies aren't my thing.

452
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,150
I'm more into football.

453
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,715
I don't understand.
I really don't.

454
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,957
So, what's with these actresses?

455
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,351
What's so special about them?

456
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,593
They're simply perfect.

457
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,399
They're exceptional.

458
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,518
Solange is class,
refinement, elegance.

459
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,995
Isabelle, is beauty, sensuality.

460
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,873
And Violette... youth, freshness.

461
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,799
Can you imagine all that
in one woman?

462
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,117
Yes, but they are three,
awkward and influential.

463
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,392
So just leave them be
and we'll all be happy.

464
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,353
I gotta talk to them.

465
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,599
He left 1 0 messages!
My voicemail was full.

466
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,392
He was hovering all morning.

467
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,119
Victor couldn't get rid of him.

468
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,151
I told you it was pointless.

469
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,318
It's even worse.
He wants to talk.

470
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,193
Instead of criticising,
suggest, for a change!

471
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,630
More daft ideas?
I'd rather not.

472
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,356
A pity.

473
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,518
If only your lQ equalled
your bust measurements.

474
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,390
Okay, that'll do!

475
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,037
Are you going
to hold that against me forever?

476
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,476
Wasn't my fault the film bombed.

477
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,955
Leaving the director didn't help.

478
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,998
I fell for the cameraman.

479
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,633
Your speciality.

480
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,309
At least I have a life,
not like you.

481
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,632
- Excuse me, ladies...
- Not now, dammit!

482
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,508
I have an idea.

483
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,075
As the police aren't acting,
maybe we could.

484
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,592
Since he says he loves us,
we could play along.

485
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,395
No, we can't stoop to that.

486
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,674
For once, I agree.

487
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,878
We've better things to do.

488
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,117
No, we have to wait.

489
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,876
He'll calm down in the end.

490
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,198
Not finishing your dessert?

491
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,875
No...

492
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,831
- Morning, Théodore.
- Mr Robert...

493
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,393
- There you go.
- Thanks.

494
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,396
See you tomorrow.

495
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,918
SOLANGE DUVlVlER
SETTLES HER SCORES

496
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,634
- What's all this?
- It came out today.

497
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,991
They could call
before publishing such rubbish!

498
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,112
What am l?
A madwoman who trashes cars!

499
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,117
Do they think I'm Sid Vicious?

500
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,675
They say they got threats from us.

501
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,189
It's crazy.
Who'd do such a thing?

502
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,754
I'll call the police!

503
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,870
No, wait.

504
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,795
Show him in.

505
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,957
We should be at the studio.

506
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,993
We'll be late.
Make up some excuse.

507
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,232
Go on, show him in.

508
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,594
Victor, I gotta talk to you.

509
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,869
It's an outrage!

510
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,674
She should sue them for slander!

511
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,277
Miss Duvivier will see you.

512
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,030
Really?

513
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,953
- But l...
- This way.

514
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,198
Hello, come in.

515
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,079
Thank you, Victor.

516
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,119
Have a seat.

517
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,671
I presume you read it too.

518
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,190
You didn't pussyfoot around.

519
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,630
I didn't think they'd publish,

520
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,628
that they'd ever suspect you, l...

521
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,873
How'd you know it was me?

522
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,632
So it was you.
I wanted to be sure.

523
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,472
I'm really sorry.

524
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,875
I know you're mad,
but I did it so they...

525
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,834
Yes, but I can do without
such publicity.

526
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,156
I guess you'll call the police,
file a new complaint?

527
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,792
No, I don't intend to.

528
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,835
Macaroon?

529
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,719
No, thanks.

530
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,358
So, Robert...

531
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,072
I'll make a deal.

532
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,713
I'll turn a blind eye

533
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,559
on one condition:
that you cool it.

534
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,873
No more hovering at my gate,
harassing Victor,

535
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,752
or trashing journalist's cars.

536
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,589
A deal?

537
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,595
- I'm so glad we spoke.
- Me too.

538
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,309
I'll call the magazine
and explain.

539
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,034
Thank you so much.

540
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,159
Just one thing,

541
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,510
I'd like you to replace the car.

542
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,312
But I could never
afford to buy a car!

543
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,155
Doesn't have to be a new car.

544
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,590
Second-hand is fine.

545
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,435
- Is that your car?
- Yes, my Twingo.

546
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,637
I like Twingos.

547
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,312
It'll do nicely.
I'll see to it.

548
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,034
But that's my car!
What'll I do?

549
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,150
Documents inside?

550
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,430
Yes, I mean, no.
You can't do this!

551
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,471
See you on set, Victor.

552
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,510
Wait!

553
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,994
Hold on!

554
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,876
My Twingo.

555
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,435
You stole his Twingo?

556
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,437
Just borrowed, Violette.

557
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,313
That's wild!
I can't believe it.

558
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,953
Don't know what came over me.

559
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,879
A sudden brainwave and I improvised.

560
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,638
But what'll you do with it?

561
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,956
I don't know.
Keep it a while.

562
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,157
Let him walk!

563
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,559
Driving is such fun,
I'd never tried.

564
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,199
Don't have your licence?

565
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,958
No, what for?

566
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,269
I have Victor.

567
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,072
This may seem strange but...

568
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,559
behind the wheel

569
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,159
I felt free.

570
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,794
My heart was pounding...

571
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,309
Haven't had such fun in ages.

572
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,511
- Even got stopped by the cops.
- No!

573
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,755
And?

574
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,473
And, nothing.

575
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,671
They asked for my autograph.

576
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,518
She'll never wear that.

577
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,151
Fame brings people
who want to manage your life.

578
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,635
I met Victor 20 years ago

579
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,432
he was playing a minor role.

580
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,713
We hit it off and when my driver
took ill, he replaced him.

581
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,230
Gave up his acting career
to become my assistant.

582
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,876
But if you're not careful,
your whole life slips away.

583
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,791
No sweetener, Victor.

584
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,989
You can go home.
I won't be needing you.

585
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,110
But Solange...

586
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,629
Thank you, Victor.
See you later.

587
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,869
He's so nice, so perfect,
but such a damn bore!

588
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,999
Where is he?
He knows it's today!

589
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,712
Christ, she'll kill me!

590
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,749
Dammit!

591
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,597
Use it whenever,
I'll be keeping it a while.

592
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,074
Thank you, Madame.

593
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,193
Just call me Solange,
I'm so tired of "Madame".

594
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,470
I feel like the Queen of England!

595
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,035
Answer.

596
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,275
Hello...

597
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,075
Is this Robert's mobile?

598
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,350
Yes, who's calling?

599
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,549
His wife.

600
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,514
It's his wife.

601
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,715
Sorry, he can't talk right now,

602
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,036
he's in the shower,
he'll call back.

603
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,552
You're pretty good
at improvising yourself!

604
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,594
So, is he coming?

605
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,392
No, he has...

606
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,034
an emergency at work.

607
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,152
Emergency!
What, a dust attack?

608
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,351
Okay, perfect, let's go for it!

609
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,997
I can't believe you did that.
It's so puerile.

610
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,878
Well, you should know.

611
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,672
Here, get a load of this.

612
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,996
- A little souvenir.
- What's that?

613
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,668
His mobile.
Tons of contacts.

614
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,268
Check out Séréna.

615
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,076
But that's my country house.

616
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,793
And my parents'...

617
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,874
This guy is sick.
Where'd he get all this?

618
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,158
He's even got Bruno's number

619
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,918
and the rugby club.

620
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,948
The bastard, I get it.

621
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,914
Well, we don't.

622
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,072
The day he left,
Bruno met this guy.

623
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,679
Said I was two-timing.

624
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,553
I thought it was an excuse
for backing out,

625
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,320
or moving on,
you know, like crabs!

626
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,954
You've lost us.

627
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,628
It's a fishwife's thing,
I'll explain later.

628
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,077
Where's she off to?

629
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,475
Sorry!

630
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,635
Hi, there.

631
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,070
Just dropped by,
am I disturbing?

632
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,432
What's he doing here?
On the prowl.

633
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,910
I don't need any lessons from you!

634
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,793
Sorry about yesterday,
something came up.

635
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,230
You'd never believe what happened.

636
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,948
Try me.

637
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,910
I had...

638
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,073
a major car problem.

639
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,669
How'd it go with the teacher?

640
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,832
Dear Robert, I'd like to meet.

641
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,837
I thought we could dine together.

642
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,589
See you at nine at Fouquet's,
lsabelle.

643
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,235
A dinner invitation,
can you imagine?

644
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,317
What's her game?
What does she want?

645
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,794
Obviously a trap.

646
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,634
Isabelle Séréna invites.
What'd you do?

647
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,558
You'd have to go.

648
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,599
But you're right.

649
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,598
I'd better not.
Enough trouble as it is.

650
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,352
Good evening, Sir.

651
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,677
Hello, I've an appointment
with lsabelle Séréna.

652
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,189
- This way, Sir.
- Thank you.

653
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,469
Sir...

654
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,910
Like an aperitif?

655
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,878
- No thanks.
- Very well.

656
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,669
Have you ordered?

657
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,236
Try the Gourmet Menu,
it's divine.

658
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,274
Christophe!

659
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,432
Two Gourmets.
And for the wine?

660
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,760
- You choose, Christophe.
- Thank you.

661
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,828
So, Robert...

662
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,797
I guess my invite surprised you,

663
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,911
but I wanted to understand...

664
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,395
what goes on in your head.

665
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,069
Here, right now, it's...

666
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,759
pretty complicated.

667
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,355
Shall we go?

668
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,715
Where?

669
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,310
A drink at my place?

670
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,718
Hold on, I don't get this.

671
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,234
You invite me for dinner,
now you're asking me over.

672
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,589
What's going on?

673
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,950
Then, just forget it.

674
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,428
I was enjoying our chat,
I wanted to continue,

675
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,073
but I guess I was mistaken.

676
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,236
Hold on, don't just go!

677
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,398
- I bid you good night.
- Okay, your place!

678
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,232
Then I'll call a cab.

679
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,990
Sir.

680
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,758
Do you take instalments?

681
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,952
I enjoy our evenings out,
but not that violent rubbish!

682
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,115
It's not rubbish.

683
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,629
Next time, I choose the movie!

684
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,235
What's up?

685
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,275
Nothing.

686
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,072
Then can we go, please?

687
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,156
Sure.

688
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,351
What an evening!

689
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,319
Make yourself comfortable.

690
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,039
Like a whisky?

691
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,119
Sure.

692
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,638
From your association?

693
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,710
Yes.

694
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,915
- His name's Augustin.
- Like your dad.

695
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,834
So cute,
you want to take them home.

696
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,429
Thanks.

697
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,479
So why don't you tell me about you?

698
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,795
Have a seat.

699
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,678
Not much to know.

700
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,149
I have a wife, a daughter...

701
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,111
I didn't see you as married.

702
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,880
We're not actually married,
but it's as if.

703
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,150
Been together long?

704
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,478
We're not really together.

705
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,472
She's no longer with me.

706
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,438
But I'm still with her.

707
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,039
- Maybe you'll meet someone else.
- No...

708
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,234
- There is no one else.
- Why not?

709
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,998
That's just how it is.

710
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,799
Like in that film with Solange,

711
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,556
when her adoptive daughter
asks her what love is

712
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,114
she replies:

713
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,794
"The day it happens, you know."

714
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,275
It's the same for me.
I know.

715
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,750
Hi there!

716
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,475
- Am I disturbing?
- Not in Toulouse?

717
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,749
Missed the plane.

718
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,715
This is Robert...

719
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,474
We've met.

720
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,592
So it's still going on?
Your two-timing charade.

721
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,599
- It's not what you think.
- Enjoyed dinner?

722
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,870
- Let me explain...
- Stay out of this.

723
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,911
We'll settle it man to man.

724
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,116
Come here, you.

725
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,436
My specialty, is the head butt.

726
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,311
Get it? Or must I explain?

727
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,238
Are you mad?

728
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,954
I said scare him,
not break his face!

729
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,596
Sorry, I guess
I just got into the role.

730
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,872
Shit! No keys.

731
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,556
Police! Don't move!

732
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,910
Hey, it's me!

733
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,835
Pelage?

734
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,555
- What're you playing at?
- Are you crazy!

735
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,034
What're you doing here?

736
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,435
Sorry, thought you were a burglar.

737
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,194
You look like a tramp!

738
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,833
A mishap, I lost my keys.

739
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,792
Help me open the window.

740
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,274
I can't, that's burglary.

741
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,959
No it's not!
It's my home.

742
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,879
Come on, I'm hurting all over.

743
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,434
Hello.

744
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,595
Bream...

745
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,633
- What luck!
- Wonderful.

746
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,034
Indeed they are.

747
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,994
These are not red sea bream...

748
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,755
No, they're gilthead bream.

749
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,913
I was in the vicinity,
so I stopped by.

750
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,916
I've got good news for you.

751
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,712
Your actresses have decided

752
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,911
not to press charges.

753
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,797
They're pressing me instead.

754
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,148
- What do you mean?
- They're out to get me.

755
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,679
To take revenge.

756
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,474
Sure you're not being paranoid?

757
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,033
You don't know them.

758
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,798
This is doing your head in.

759
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,999
You need a change of air.

760
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,350
The France-ltaly game!
How about it?

761
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,152
Football? No thanks.

762
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,794
You'll see, you'll love it.

763
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,318
Sure it was him?

764
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,111
Maybe it was a business dinner?

765
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,912
Odd for a cleaner.

766
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,633
A "surface technician".

767
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,400
Well, she was quite a surface.

768
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,109
It's better that way.
I prefer to know.

769
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,638
I knew something was going on
he didn't dare tell me about.

770
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,633
But I'm glad...

771
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,552
I'm even happy for him.

772
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,994
Honestly, really happy for him.

773
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,508
So what did she look like?

774
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,109
A sex bomb.

775
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,838
That's wild.

776
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,871
What a stunt!

777
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,799
Yes, pretty good,
I must admit.

778
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,195
Just hope he didn't break his nose.

779
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,958
No, he'll be okay.

780
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,878
A tough cookie, our Robert.

781
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,877
He won't be back in a hurry.

782
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,640
I found him almost touching
last night.

783
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,509
- Not falling in love?
- No...

784
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,917
It was just pleasant.
We talked, he listened.

785
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,476
Men tend to ogle me, not listen.

786
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,150
I talked to Bruno about adoption

787
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,476
and I told him I'd had enough.

788
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,717
But you'd organised your trip,
even learnt Rumanian.

789
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,992
No, I'm still going.
I meant him. I dumped him.

790
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,630
- What!
- No loss, balls for brains.

791
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,035
I want a man to share my life,

792
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,753
not just my bed and page one,

793
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,670
who'd speak of me
like Robert of his wife.

794
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,119
Enthusiastic, kind.

795
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,639
A guy who acts,

796
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,628
able to get emotional about
something other than rugby!

797
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,715
Simple, no?

798
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,549
Mr Pelage.

799
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,558
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello.

800
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,558
JR isn't with you?

801
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,591
No, he couldn't get away.

802
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,951
But I can't work
without the patient.

803
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,832
I can tell you the symptoms.

804
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,354
He's not very well.

805
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,319
He can't sleep.

806
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,037
That's rare.
Cats usually sleep 1 6 hours a day.

807
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,514
Yes, but he can't.

808
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,359
He's really on edge.

809
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,598
His hands, I mean his paws,
are sweaty.

810
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,629
No appetite.

811
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,311
For JR, that's worrying.

812
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,354
So I was wondering if you could
prescribe something,

813
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,558
tranquillizers,

814
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,148
sleeping pills...

815
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,190
I'd need to know a bit more
about his problems.

816
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,314
They're top actresses,
movie stars.

817
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,353
You must know them,
Duvivier, Séréna.

818
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,157
Right, not just anybody.

819
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,195
- They're out to get me.
- Of course.

820
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,994
What would you do?

821
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,030
I'd see a psychiatrist.

822
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,591
This is a tranquillizer,
for cats and humans.

823
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,110
But it's just for now.
Next time come with JR.

824
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,355
Thanks, see you Monday.

825
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,710
Right, with JR.

826
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,199
Welcome to "My ldol"!

827
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,190
What's going on?

828
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,868
The idea is that actors
go meet their fans.

829
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,832
For my programme,
I chose you.

830
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,235
What's all this?
How did you get in?

831
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,193
By the door.
Who forgot his keys at lsabelle's?

832
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,960
Another of your tricks?
Well, I'm sick of it!

833
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,391
You just tell the viewers
you're happy to see me.

834
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,113
Why's my furniture outside?

835
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,992
To make room to shoot.

836
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,315
Got any beer?

837
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,836
What's he doing here?

838
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,110
- And JR? Where's JR?
- Who?

839
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,390
- My cat on the couch.
- Outside, I'm allergic.

840
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,397
- Outside?
- In the garden.

841
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,999
Should he be so fat?

842
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,958
The nerve! Come on, out!

843
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,754
No more fans, no more idols,
no more shooting,

844
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,873
no crew, no technicians...
Beat it or I call the cops!

845
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,271
And you, get your ass out of there!

846
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,155
Wait!

847
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,316
You can't just leave me like this!

848
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,592
Do a little spring clean!
Might cheer you up.

849
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,193
Goodnight!

850
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,793
But that's my Twingo...

851
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,953
My Twingo!

852
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,999
Fuck them!

853
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,430
Fuck them all!

854
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,352
I have to act.
They're going too far.

855
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,200
Do they think
they can walk all over me?

856
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,312
Even Violette Duval's in on it.
She's a rising star.

857
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,629
Yes, of course.

858
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,357
After all I've done for her!

859
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,356
Indeed...

860
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,915
Couldn't they have stayed put?
On the screen.

861
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,078
Why did they have
to break into my life!

862
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,191
With regard to JR's treatment...

863
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,879
I know!
I'll go get my Twingo.

864
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,719
Right, good idea...

865
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,639
You're a great help,
see you on Monday.

866
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,434
But next time bring the cat...

867
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,909
See you Monday.

868
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,114
Bloody hell!

869
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,709
It always works in the movies.

870
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,239
So, you broke into a trailer
and a car.

871
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,714
But it's my car.

872
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,319
Then why break into it?

873
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,670
The keys were in the trailer.

874
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,354
The one you were burgling?

875
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,438
Right, so I could start my car.

876
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,835
If the keys were in the trailer,
why the car?

877
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,837
I'd no keys for the trailer.

878
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,111
Got the car documents?

879
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,230
They're in the trailer.

880
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,670
Then how can you prove it's yours?

881
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,757
By getting into the trailer.

882
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,791
That, Sir, is called burglary.

883
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,192
But I had to steal it back
to prove it was mine.

884
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,350
Solange Duvivier stole my car
and left the keys in her trailer.

885
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,672
- Solange Duvivier?
- Right.

886
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,679
She stole your Twingo?

887
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,155
Exactly, you got it.

888
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,239
I see...

889
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,229
Look, you broke the law
by burgling a car and a trailer...

890
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,316
This is too much!

891
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,479
They steal my car,
break my face, wreck my home

892
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,719
and it's me who gets arrested!
Christ, what next!

893
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,912
Can I have a word?

894
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,511
Seems he's an old hand.

895
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,913
The actresses already
filed a complaint,

896
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,635
but didn't press charges,
for harassment, intrusion...

897
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,876
I get it, another crackpot.

898
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,149
Right.

899
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,749
- Seeing a psychiatrist?
- Sorry?

900
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,271
Have you consulted a psychiatrist?

901
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,951
No, why?
I saw a psy-cat-analyst, but...

902
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,276
The term is "psychoanalyst".

903
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,239
No, she's a psy-cat-analyst.
I went for my cat...

904
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,758
Enough. Just lock him up.

905
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,073
What came over you?

906
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,152
Just wanted some fun.

907
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,358
How was I to know
there'd be a storm?

908
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,631
But how did you organize it?

909
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,429
It was a day off,
so I asked the crew.

910
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,471
But you'd never believe
what I found at Robert's.

911
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,990
In his office
he has our every photo and article

912
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,316
even a diary
with our appointments.

913
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,955
That's crazy.
Does he work for the ClA?

914
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,433
He'd even cancelled a try-out
I was to do for TV.

915
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,232
Of all the nerve!

916
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,517
That must make you so angry.

917
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,717
No, I think he did right.

918
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,031
If I'd got it
I wouldn't have worked with you.

919
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,511
I'm beginning to think
I have a lucky star.

920
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,276
Well, his name is Robert.

921
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,718
- Who'd like more cake?
- Me.

922
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,313
Everything must go.

923
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,596
Solange, it's delicious.

924
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,711
Yes, you're such a good cook.

925
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,115
I can hardly boil an egg.

926
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,598
Haven't cooked for years,

927
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,439
but I've always liked it.

928
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,915
It's fun, and it's relaxing.

929
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,431
Only, Victor is in a sulk.

930
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,473
Usually, when I have guests,
he cooks.

931
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,431
How about some fizz to celebrate?

932
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,036
- But you don't drink.
- So they say.

933
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,358
Tonight, it's champagne!

934
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,038
I propose a toast.

935
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,196
To Robert,
who brought us together.

936
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,515
To Robert!

937
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,873
Came as quick as I could.

938
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,117
A nice mess you're in.
I'll try and get you out.

939
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,594
But I can't promise.

940
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,631
The harassing cleaner

941
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,192
- What's that?
- Today's paper.

942
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,109
"The police caught the harasser
of movie stars red-handed.

943
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,393
"The actresses had already filed
a complaint against Robert Pelage.

944
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,718
"lt appears the crazy fan
is a cleaner at their agent's."

945
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,273
He works at the agency?

946
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,914
That's how he had
the low-down on us.

947
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,190
As Violette would say:
that's wild!

948
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,599
Hey, buddy!

949
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,389
Where have you been?

950
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,753
- Robert Pelage?
- Yes.

951
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,359
It's Mr Martial.

952
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,438
I've always been
very satisfied with you

953
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,995
but the talent agency is furious.

954
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,997
We'll have to let you go.

955
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,955
JOB NEWS

956
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,715
Dad, you've got to find a job.

957
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,876
You think it's that easy.

958
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,798
There you go, buddy.

959
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,316
Now JR is drinking whisky?

960
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,392
It's tough for him too.

961
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,073
Why not set up
your own cleaning company?

962
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,431
I'd need money and who'd lend?

963
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,398
You could at least try.

964
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,955
You always say
you didn't have the choice.

965
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,479
Today you do.

966
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,592
It's sink or swim,
I'd rather you swam.

967
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,119
You've no wife, no job

968
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,993
but you have a daughter
and she's sick of it!

969
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,119
Well, I never.

970
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,794
- Mr Pelage?
- Hi, Anita.

971
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,036
You can't just walk in!

972
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,116
He only receives by appointment!

973
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,150
I won't be long.

974
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,077
Sorry to bother you,
I'll be brief.

975
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,919
You don't know me,
I was your office cleaner.

976
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,951
- Please, Sir...
- It's okay, Joanna.

977
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,152
Now I've been fired,
but the casting was my idea.

978
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,909
Without me, you'd have never
co-starred lsabelle and Solange

979
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,951
and missed out on Violette Duval.

980
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,310
I wanted you to know.
Goodbye.

981
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,149
Joanna?

982
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,479
See you later!

983
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,799
It won't be forever.

984
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,709
We'll keep in touch,
call each other.

985
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,391
You took such good care of me,
I'll never forget it.

986
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,148
But today
I need to find myself anew,

987
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,511
to refocus on my desires,
my urges,

988
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,631
to take my life in hand.

989
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,230
Life and I had lost touch
with each other.

990
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,755
You too need some time out.

991
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,273
See your family again.

992
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,032
I almost forgot!

993
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,674
For you.

994
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,915
Macaroons.

995
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,878
One last time.

996
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,152
Miss Duvivier's secretary speaking.

997
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,434
Your agent.

998
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,839
Your plane.

999
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,036
Augustin is progressing daily,

1000
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,515
even saying a few words in French.

1001
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,194
We spend hours together,
getting to know each other.

1002
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,993
And oddly,

1003
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,477
I think I've met someone.

1004
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,913
Augustin adores him.

1005
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,509
He's a French doctor working here.

1006
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,878
I've never felt so good
with any man...

1007
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,753
I feel he's Mr Right.

1008
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,152
The day it happens, you know.

1009
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,272
I'm so happy for you.
You deserve it.

1010
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,595
My Gran used to say:

1011
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,678
"Men are like oysters.
Not many pearls!"

1012
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,548
Dominique?

1013
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,314
How are you?

1014
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,159
Thanks for coming.

1015
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,351
Lovely to see you.

1016
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,596
I wanted to make you an offer.

1017
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,438
I'd like to be your agent.

1018
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,519
With pleasure.

1019
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,356
Victor?

1020
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,956
Hello, Violette.
Two?

1021
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,469
Two.

1022
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,196
I hired him.
I needed a new assistant.

1023
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,431
Joanna was getting so messy.

1024
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,796
And telling lies too.

1025
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,632
Thank you, Victor.

1026
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,313
He was so down after the break-up
with Solange, I had to.

1027
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,356
So, I have a screenplay
for you to read.

1028
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,836
The director had chosen
Marie Janson and now...

1029
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,519
he's hesitating.

1030
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,233
He wants to meet you.

1031
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,668
It's a great role.

1032
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,754
Thank you.

1033
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,712
- It's not sure.
- No, I mean

1034
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,912
for choosing me to work
with Solange and lsabelle.

1035
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,879
I'd wanted to talk to you
about that too.

1036
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,559
I'm lost for words.

1037
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,159
We bought all new stuff.

1038
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,595
And...

1039
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,590
I brought back your Twingo.

1040
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,270
When Dominique told us
they fired you,

1041
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,471
we had to do something.

1042
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,314
And he said the casting
was your idea.

1043
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,115
That's wild!

1044
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,833
He gave us this for you.

1045
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,836
He insisted they give you
a severance package.

1046
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,869
Thank you.

1047
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,115
It's good, it'll help you

1048
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,078
get off to a new start.

1049
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,992
Someone got there first.

1050
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,354
My wife's moving south
with my daughter.

1051
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,834
She's leaving me

1052
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,791
for good, for someone else.

1053
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,189
And...

1054
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,431
you're just giving up?

1055
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,957
Not like with my suitors.

1056
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,159
You had them running.

1057
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,193
She's right.
You have to put up a fight!

1058
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,356
Symbolically, of course.

1059
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,759
She's made up her mind.

1060
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,919
She won't change it.

1061
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,228
So, going to sit there
and watch your life get away?

1062
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,512
It's time you woke up
and did something.

1063
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,954
Robert,

1064
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,720
a woman needs a man who'll commit.

1065
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,197
I'm not sure I can.

1066
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,197
Well, you did it for us.

1067
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,469
You were different.

1068
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,035
You were distant, untouchable.

1069
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,876
You can't love someone who's near?

1070
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,192
Is that why your wife left?

1071
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,033
My specialty is the head butt.

1072
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,116
Create Your Own Company

1073
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,798
Ladies' Follies

1074
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:31,192
A few months later...

1075
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,836
We're delighted to be here

1076
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,759
to present this film
of which we're very proud.

1077
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,238
A lot happened during the shoot
that you won't see on screen.

1078
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,198
There's one person
we'd especially like to thank,

1079
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,551
not here tonight,
but we dedicate the film to him...

1080
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,715
Robert.

1081
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,788
Good evening.

1082
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,356
Two Gourmet Menus
and for the wine, you choose.

1083
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,715
Thank you.

1084
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,955
Thank you Madam,
enjoy your evening.

1085
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,869
Fancy place, this is a first.

1086
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,195
So?

1087
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,155
What did you have to ask me?

1088
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,113
Could I take...

1089
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,478
Lucie to a drawing exhibit
on Saturday?

1090
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,429
Robert...

1091
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,236
You didn't invite me here for that?

1092
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,190
Right.

1093
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,712
I set up my own cleaning firm
and just got my first contract.

1094
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,631
It's not the job I'd dreamed of,

1095
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,910
but I've had my fill of dreams.

1096
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,592
The life I want is this one

1097
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,716
with you.

1098
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,551
I know I wasn't up to par,

1099
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,796
that I was pretty useless,

1100
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,230
or let's face it,
downright stupid.

1101
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,476
But I've changed, I'm a new man.

1102
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,274
- I even saw a psy-cat-analyst.
- "Psychoanalyst".

1103
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,392
No, in fact's she's a...

1104
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,552
Forget it.

1105
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,272
For me, you've always been,

1106
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,311
but for real I want you to be...

1107
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,750
my wife.

1108
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,674
To Robert... Zidane

1109
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,031
Subtitles: Peter Leonard

1110
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,629
