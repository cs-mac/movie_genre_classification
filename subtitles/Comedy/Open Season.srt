1
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:21,006
Now, that's a roar, Boog.

2
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,124
Now get in. We're gonna be late.

3
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:29,078
No denying. The girl's got growl.
But can she get down like this?

4
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,861
Can you get down like this?
Bring it here. Bring it.

5
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:34,678
Then bring it right back, huh?
Look at that. Look at that.

6
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:50,486
Here it comes.

7
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:37,380
Hey, Gordy.

8
00:02:38,342 --> 00:02:39,968
Morning, Beth.

9
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,712
Welcome to Timberline's
Wilderness Extravaganza.

10
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,295
I'm Ranger Beth.

11
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:58,083
Please, put your hands together
for Boog.

12
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,284
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

13
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,095
You can say I'm in love
You could say I'm insane

14
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:21,124
But no one understands me
Like my darling Lorraine

15
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,223
Looks like you're going
from one grill to another.

16
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,770
We rocked that house,
didn't we, Boog?

17
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:41,615
They were eating out of our hands.
Well, my hands, your paws.

18
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:44,593
Eating out of your paw.

19
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:48,882
That's good.
That's going in the show.

20
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:54,032
Shaw.
That guy really chaps my khakis.

21
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:56,203
You wait here, Boog.

22
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,586
- Cuff him, Gordy.
- Oh, the Girl Scouts are here.

23
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:02,186
He's at it again.

24
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:06,098
Shaw, hunting season doesn't start
for three days.

25
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,466
What are you doing
with that buck on your hood?

26
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:12,909
What? It ain't my fault.
He ran right in front of my truck.

27
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,967
Where, on the interstate?

28
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:20,879
Sort of.

29
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,135
Where is that girl?

30
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:38,103
That's nasty.

31
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,690
What? What the...?
What's going on? Where am I?

32
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:52,408
I saw a bright light and...
I saw two bright lights and...

33
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:55,291
- Am I dead?
- Not yet.

34
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:57,310
But seeing how
that is Shaw's truck...

35
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,122
- What's a Shaw?
- Only the nastiest hunter in town.

36
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:02,905
A hunter? Did he get you too?

37
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,274
You don't see me tied up,
do you, baby?

38
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:08,091
- This is my ride.
- Your ride?

39
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:09,632
Yeah, this is my town, okay?

40
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,925
These are my people.
This is where I reside.

41
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:17,279
Nobody's hunting this bear.

42
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:22,652
Really? Well, then untie me.
Please? Look, no one's looking.

43
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,024
- Ain't gonna be able to do it.
- What am I gonna do?

44
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,490
I don't wanna be mounted on a wall.

45
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,791
- Calm down. Ain't gonna happen.
- It's not?

46
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:34,332
- Not with that rack.
- I don't have a problem with...

47
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,802
My... It's...

48
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:41,058
I'm a unihorn. Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.

49
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:44,419
I'm hideous. I'm a monster.

50
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:45,544
- Tree-hugger.
- Knuckle dragger.

51
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,267
- Tree-hugger.
- Knuckle dragger.

52
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:48,642
Veggieburger.

53
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,815
All right, all right.
That's enough, you two.

54
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,188
Listen, Girl Scout,
they're dumb animals.

55
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:58,754
I'm just respecting the natural order:
Man on top, animals on the bottom.

56
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:02,370
But your bear...
Now, now, your bear is special.

57
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,386
He belongs somewhere
in the middle.

58
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:09,409
Between two slices of rye,
smothered in gravy.

59
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:14,026
You're a sick, sick,
twisted puppy, Shaw.

60
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:19,051
Put me down for a box of Thin Mints,
will you, sweetie?

61
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,263
Six-toed gun monkey.
Boog, come on, let's get out of here.

62
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:29,061
Come on, I'm begging you.
Please, please. Just untie me.

63
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,046
Come on. Please, please, please?

64
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,987
Hey, go on now. Scamper on
back to the woods, little buddy.

65
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,460
Little one-horned freak.

66
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,528
Buddy? He called me "buddy."

67
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:52,400
My buck.

68
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:56,784
My truck. Why, you little...

69
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:59,152
Shaw, no shooting in town.

70
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:03,375
But, Gordy, that bear leaned over
and untied my buck.

71
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,819
- Didn't you see that?
- All I see is a busted headlight.

72
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:12,812
Shaw, you've been living
in the woods too long.

73
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:21,006
They can't tell me what I seen,
because only I know what I seen.

74
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:26,132
Wheel of Fortune!

75
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:32,017
Big money got to come. Come on.

76
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:35,285
- Okay, buddy, time for bed.
- Five hundred...

77
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,458
- There's no R...
- Boog.

78
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:39,766
Mr. Dinkleman's waiting.

79
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,662
Good night, big guy.

80
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,073
Oh, did I forget something?

81
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:06,263
No, no, no. No more treats for you.

82
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:08,733
No, stop it.

83
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,955
Not the face.
Oh, no, not the eyebrows too.

84
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,936
No, it's not gonna work this time.
Stop it. I'm serious, Boog.

85
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:20,255
It's cute, but no... All right.

86
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:28,033
If you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise

87
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:33,051
If you go out in the woods today
You'd better go in disguise

88
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,490
For every bear
That ever there was

89
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:38,206
Will gather there together because

90
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,097
Today's the day

91
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:47,039
The teddy bears have their picnic

92
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,666
Good night, Boog.

93
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,110
Who's there?

94
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,409
I'm warning you. I got ten claws
and I ain't afraid to use them.

95
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,059
- Hey, buddy. It's me, Elliot.
- What are you doing here?

96
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:10,917
You helped me,
I'm returning the favor.

97
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,604
I'm busting you out of here.
Let's go. Let's do this.

98
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,773
Come on. Let's book it before
the warden makes her rounds.

99
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,755
No, cornflake.
You've got it all twisted.

100
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:24,968
- This here is my home.
- Sweet.

101
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:27,141
Now haul your little butt
back out that window.

102
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,165
- What's this?
- Get off of that.

103
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:33,484
So soft. What is that?

104
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:37,065
What are you doing in there?

105
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:38,950
This place is big enough for two.

106
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,324
- What?
- Wow, look at that.

107
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:43,725
Does this look natural?

108
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,863
- Give me that.
- Oh, who's this little guy?

109
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,414
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman?

110
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:51,975
Is Dinkleman your doll?

111
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:54,797
I don't care about that old thing.

112
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:01,613
Oh, I get it. You're like a pet.

113
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,325
- I ain't nobody's pet.
- Right.

114
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:09,290
I do what I want, when I want,
and I come and go as I please.

115
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:11,500
Well, then let's go.

116
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,119
Outside?

117
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:19,345
Why would I wanna go outside
when I got all I need in...

118
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,123
Whoa, what's that?

119
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:25,295
I call them Woo Hoos, like:

120
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:27,890
You want one?

121
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:31,570
I know where there's a bunch of them,
but you gotta go...

122
00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:34,644
...outside.

123
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:39,674
Inside. Outside.

124
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,006
- Inside. Outside.
- Stop it.

125
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,783
- Stupid nose.
- Inside. Outsi...

126
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:01,499
Okay, I got that Woo Hoo right out of
one of those container doohickeys.

127
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,052
You got that out the garbage?

128
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:07,196
I had that in my mouth
and everything.

129
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:10,491
Dude, you're freaking me out
with that nose thing.

130
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,971
- Whoa.
- What is it?

131
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:18,454
- It's a whole Woo Hoo village.
- Sweet.

132
00:11:20,737 --> 00:11:23,389
It's locked. Maybe we should
come back tomorrow.

133
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:24,797
Hey.

134
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:29,373
Elliot, look what you... You did.

135
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:32,289
You gonna get us in some trouble.

136
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,483
The Woo Hoo bar.

137
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:39,491
She's my lady. Smooth and creamy.

138
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:42,752
So bad, I shouldn't. Yet I will.

139
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,759
What is that?

140
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:55,683
Whoa, let me try.

141
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:02,017
Boog. Boog?

142
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:07,522
- Hello, idiot.
- It's "Elliot."

143
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,719
I come in peace.

144
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,266
I'm foraging.

145
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,920
Pepperoni!

146
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:14,450
- All right. Yeah, there it is. Let's go.
- Boog, party's over, let's go.

147
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:20,051
- All right, yeah, there it is.
- Freeze.

148
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,920
Behold, the mighty grizzly.
Good night.

149
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,488
If you go out in the woods today
There's gonna be some fries

150
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,446
Yeah, and the giraffes...

151
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:54,995
...they taste almost exactly
like the elephants.

152
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:57,269
That's messed up.

153
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,062
Hey, Gordy.

154
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:05,753
Back up quick, before she sees me.

155
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,204
You're in big trouble, mister.

156
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:20,632
You know what sugar does
to you, Boog.

157
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,168
Straight to bed, now!

158
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,859
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
It won't happen again.

159
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:31,579
- What if he had hurt someone?
- Gordy, please.

160
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:35,260
- We're talking about Boog here.
- Hey, what are you looking at?

161
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,532
I told you not to wait up.

162
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,530
- I'll take him back to the woods.
- It's time to put him where he belongs.

163
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,345
No, no, he's not ready to go back yet.
I mean, it's not my fault.

164
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:48,292
I tried to teach him the basics.

165
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:51,716
I took him fishing,
but he didn't wanna get wet.

166
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:54,949
Gordy, please...

167
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:01,094
Boog is sorry.

168
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:05,502
- Beth, you're not his mother.
- I'm not mothering him.

169
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:10,370
Excuse me. Go to bed, Boog!

170
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,605
One more summer.

171
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,713
That's all I'm asking,
one summer.

172
00:15:21,227 --> 00:15:23,235
Great, see? I can be reasonable.
Thanks.

173
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,291
You know something?

174
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:29,544
The longer you wait, the harder
it's gonna be for him to adapt.

175
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:34,155
Oh, I'm sure he'll...
At least I think he'll...

176
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:37,220
And the harder it's gonna be
for you to let him go.

177
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,303
Good night, Beth.

178
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:06,384
What am I gonna do with you?

179
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:22,068
This isn't decaf. You know
what caffeine does to me, Bob.

180
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,718
I'd be talking up a storm,
chatting your ear off...

181
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,609
...a mile a minute
for the whole ride.

182
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:33,168
Mr. Weenie, heel. Heel, Mr. Weenie.

183
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:36,439
Hot.

184
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:43,503
It's terrible but wonderful
at the same time.

185
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:45,682
It's like freedom in a cup.

186
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,408
Out of hand.

187
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,385
You know, I heard Boog got loose
last night...

188
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:00,082
...and he totally trashed the place.

189
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,681
- Really?
- That's what happened.

190
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,406
There's something wrong
going on here.

191
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:11,899
You? It walks like a man.

192
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:22,556
Hold still,
you two-legged latte drinker.

193
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,898
Look out!

194
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:30,335
Not again.

195
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,985
Boog will have you eating out
of his paw.

196
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:38,232
Get it?
"Paw," because he's a bear?

197
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:42,113
- So anyway...
- Oh, man.

198
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:45,854
Okay, relax, Boog.
You can do this.

199
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:50,140
- What the...?
- I gotta hide. I gotta hide.

200
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:52,862
What are you doing?
Get out of here. Hey.

201
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,331
He's right behind me.

202
00:17:58,022 --> 00:18:01,088
I knew it.
That bear's corrupted my buck.

203
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,133
Hide me.

204
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:11,013
- All right, he's gone. Now get out.
- Good idea.

205
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:13,795
- Where you going?
- Behold, the mighty grizzly.

206
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:21,832
How cute, a donkey.

207
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:27,874
- You got me in enough trouble.
- Hey, l... You saved my life.

208
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,215
That means
that you're responsible for me.

209
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,552
What? Stop messing up my life.

210
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,659
You needed to get out.
You should thank me.

211
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,968
- Thank you?
- You're welcome, buddy.

212
00:18:37,134 --> 00:18:39,501
Stop calling me that. Now get out.

213
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:41,189
Need to hide. Need to hide.

214
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,272
Boog?

215
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:45,926
Oh, no, you don't.
You're leaving now.

216
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,753
- Out of the coat. Take it off.
- No. No!

217
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,774
- Take off the coat.
- No means no.

218
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,184
- He's eating the donkey.
- He's gonna eat us all.

219
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:56,655
You know he's still out there.

220
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:59,784
Eat you? He's not gonna...
Boog, what are you doing?

221
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:01,448
Put that animal down this instant.

222
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:04,557
- Hold still.
- No, I'm staying.

223
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:05,900
But my show!

224
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,074
Sit, Boog. You're getting a time-out.

225
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:10,218
Do you hear me?
I'm totally getting angry.

226
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:12,722
That guy wants to kill me.

227
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:15,341
No, wait.

228
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:20,756
- I chipped a hoof.
- Chipped a...?

229
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,306
You chipped a... I'm gonna kill you.

230
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:27,372
He's harmless. Really.
Stay calm. Stay calm!

231
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,003
Out of my way. Move.

232
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:31,793
Show's over,
you four-legged freaks of nature.

233
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:40,628
Perfect.

234
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,516
Shaw. Drop that gun.

235
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,747
You're ruining my show.

236
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:48,532
Easy, now. Just line them up.

237
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:52,276
Two heads, one bullet.

238
00:19:57,403 --> 00:20:00,699
Buttermilk biscuits.

239
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,470
Shaw, you're under arrest.

240
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,935
Shaw?

241
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:28,480
Gordy, I didn't know
what else to do. L...

242
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,910
It's time, Beth.

243
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:32,862
But what about hunting season?

244
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,874
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

245
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:36,889
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

246
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:13,807
You're gonna be...

247
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,006
You're gonna be fine.

248
00:22:20,597 --> 00:22:22,768
I'm gonna miss you, big guy.

249
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:08,022
Pretty.

250
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:19,737
Where's home? It's gone.

251
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:22,007
Someone stole it.

252
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:25,625
Hey, could you keep it down?

253
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:28,542
I'm trying to sleep here.

254
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:32,791
You.

255
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:35,100
- No, I didn't do it.
- Take a good look, Elliot.

256
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:37,502
What do you see, Elliot?
Something's missing, Elliot.

257
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,040
What is it, Elliot? What is it?

258
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:41,241
Wait, don't tell me. I...

259
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,904
Timberline is missing!

260
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:45,563
- I was just gonna say that.
- My garage is missing.

261
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,903
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner
are missing.

262
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:52,891
My life is missing,
and it's all your fault.

263
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,362
What are you gonna do?

264
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,011
You're funny.

265
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:06,885
I thought, "Maybe," but then
I was like... and then...

266
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,660
This ain't happening.
It's some kind of mistake.

267
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:12,385
Think, Boog. She's mad,
but you can fix this.

268
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,755
All right, I'll go back
and I'll give her the face.

269
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,480
The face.

270
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:19,648
Gotta get back before
she forgets the face.

271
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:23,264
That'll clear it all up right there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the face.

272
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:28,677
Boog!

273
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,751
You can't just go wandering
around out here.

274
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:33,671
You don't know where you're going,
Boog!

275
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:35,177
I'm going home.

276
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,892
Wait. Boog.

277
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:40,260
I know where Timberline is.

278
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:44,106
- I can get you back.
- Thank you, but no thank you.

279
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,472
Quiet.

280
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:52,523
Timberline's gotta be
around here somewhere.

281
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:57,000
Well, that was quick.

282
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:04,717
Now, let's see.
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

283
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:08,400
Boog, is that you?

284
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:25,419
Boog.

285
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,035
Okay, I gotta get the lay of the land.

286
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:39,062
Somehow...

287
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,974
...if I get up high enough, then...

288
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,014
All right.

289
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:47,280
I can do this.

290
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,008
No problem.

291
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:55,986
Lost your way to Sunday school, pal?

292
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:59,537
This is McSquizzy's turf.
Nobody messes with McSquizzy.

293
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,397
Because that's me.

294
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:03,450
- What?
- Touch a needle in this tree...

295
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:06,678
...and I'll give you such a doing!
- Yeah?

296
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,884
You and what army?

297
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:12,216
Oh, that army.

298
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,519
Mess not with the furrytail clan.

299
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:18,001
Defenders of the good,
crusaders of the righteous...

300
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:20,312
...guardians of the pine.

301
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:24,541
Keep your tree. I'll find another one.

302
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:29,790
Look! He's got a wee freakish twin
growing out of his back.

303
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:37,821
Oh, this one will work.

304
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:40,887
Hey. That was a warning, all right?

305
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:44,889
Try that again, and I'll be kicking
your furry brown bahookie!

306
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:46,967
- What?
- Hey, this is a different tree.

307
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,699
They're all my trees.

308
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:51,867
I suggest you turn round and head
right back from whence you came.

309
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:54,817
That's what I'm trying to do.
So just point me the way to town...

310
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,768
...and I'll be out of here.

311
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:04,286
That's it.
You're asking for a whooping.

312
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,923
Ready!

313
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:07,514
Fire!

314
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:12,412
Hey, Boog, look. No hands.

315
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,306
I think I'm getting a sunburn,
though.

316
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:15,681
Check it out.

317
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:19,299
All right, where's town?

318
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:22,945
Or what we would call this,
a moon burn.

319
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,759
Look, just give me the directions.

320
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:28,166
I really need to get back.

321
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:29,540
So sad.

322
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:33,155
- Where's Timberline?
- Okay. Okay. All right.

323
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:34,882
You got it good
in Timberline, right?

324
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:38,466
Coffee, Woo Hoo bars, safety.

325
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:41,865
- Yeah, so?
- And still, something is missing.

326
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,653
- There is?
- Yep. Me.

327
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:45,730
And I want in, Boog.
I'll take you to town...

328
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,908
...but when we get there,
we're partners.

329
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:49,986
Deal, partner?

330
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:52,841
What? Oh, no, no, no.

331
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,981
That ain't never
gonna happen. Never.

332
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,037
Don't you have a herd
to get back to?

333
00:27:57,199 --> 00:28:00,941
What...? My herd?
They... My herd will understand.

334
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:03,112
These guys are my...
They're my buddies.

335
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,998
- They... They want the best for me.
- Forget it.

336
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,772
Oh, well.
Better start moving, then.

337
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:11,944
Because open season starts
in a few days.

338
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:14,448
Maybe one of those hunters
can give you a ride back...

339
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,911
...on the hood of their truck.

340
00:28:18,578 --> 00:28:20,488
Hunters. Dang.

341
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:25,004
- Okay, okay.
- So we have a deal, then?

342
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,375
Okay, let me hear you say it.

343
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:33,518
- Partners?
- You're disgusting.

344
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:35,889
- What was that?
- I...

345
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:39,825
- Sorry, can't hear you.
- I said, I guess...

346
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:41,484
...we can be partners.

347
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:44,044
Partners?

348
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,454
Partners.

349
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:52,078
Okeydokey, this way!
Move it or lose it!

350
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:54,257
You know, we should have
a secret handshake...

351
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:57,075
...and like nicknames and stuff.
Like, cool nicknames, though.

352
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:58,583
I'll call you Boogster...

353
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:01,015
...and then you can call me
The Incredible Mister E.

354
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:03,152
Isn't that great?
I came up with that myself.

355
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:05,493
I made that up. You know,
this is gonna be awesome.

356
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:07,065
It's just you and me.

357
00:29:07,227 --> 00:29:10,097
Hey, who's the lady in the shorts?

358
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:24,569
I hope I'm not too late.

359
00:29:24,957 --> 00:29:27,030
They've been out here all night.

360
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,108
A bear...

361
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,865
...and a deer, working together.

362
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:33,817
How far does this conspiracy go?

363
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:36,537
What other animals are involved?
God bless America!

364
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:39,552
I hope the bald eagle hasn't turned.

365
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:41,818
No, no, no.

366
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:43,894
Maybe they're right.

367
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:47,295
Maybe... Maybe old Shaw is crazy.

368
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:50,360
Yeah, maybe.

369
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:02,179
Isn't it peaceful out here, Bob?

370
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:05,376
You're right, Bob. Let's not spoil
the beauty of this moment...

371
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:06,718
...with idle chatter.

372
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:09,439
Some people can just jibber-jabber
till the cows come home.

373
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:12,901
What does that mean, Bob?
"Till the cows come home."

374
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,266
Where have the cows been?

375
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:28,610
Okay, Forest 101.

376
00:30:28,777 --> 00:30:30,784
These big wood stick things
are called trees.

377
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:36,290
The big rocks are called mountains,
and the little rocks are their babies.

378
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:40,296
Altitude.

379
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:45,000
No jelly arm, no jelly arm. Come on.

380
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:48,961
- Elliot!
- Boogster, it's...

381
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,409
How many times must I say it?

382
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:52,994
I am the Incredible Mister E.

383
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,508
Elliot, please.

384
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,644
Look, if you don't use
the code names...

385
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:59,782
...how am I supposed to know that
it's really you that I'm talking to?

386
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:14,633
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I got it.

387
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:17,006
Nice and easy.

388
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,093
Just rip it off fast, like a Band-Aid.

389
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:23,916
Hold still, okay?

390
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,603
Just be calm.
This might pinch a little.

391
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:30,636
- Get it over with.
- You may wanna cover your ears.

392
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:31,949
Cover my...?

393
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:38,259
Okay, scamper on back
to the woods, little buddy.

394
00:31:40,437 --> 00:31:41,866
Buddy.

395
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:44,788
Okay, ladies, this dam
ain't gonna build itself!

396
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,187
Lift that birch.
Swing those pines over here.

397
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:49,075
Come on. Move it!

398
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,449
Yo, O'Toole!

399
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:52,917
- Yeah, boss?
- I want you to cantilever that cedar...

400
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,560
...on the bias down by the north end,
you got that?

401
00:31:57,496 --> 00:31:59,636
Put a twig in the hole.

402
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:01,391
Rookie.

403
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:03,535
Take five for lunch!

404
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:07,221
- What do you got?
- Wood.

405
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:09,776
- What do you got?
- Wood.

406
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:11,735
You wanna trade?

407
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:14,800
Hey, hey, guys. Check it out.

408
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:17,907
There goes the largest carnivore
in North America.

409
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:21,721
- The mighty grizzly.
- And he's a good dancer.

410
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,259
We're gonna be in a show.

411
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:28,760
Come here!

412
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,933
Hey, that's my good antler.

413
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:34,037
Listen, simple. We are not "we."

414
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:37,556
It's just me.
And we ain't doing no show.

415
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:39,037
- Diva.
- What?

416
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,662
I understand what's going on here.

417
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:42,806
You're a little crabby
because you're hungry.

418
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:44,350
I, I...

419
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:48,281
I think yes.

420
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:51,514
I'm starving!

421
00:32:51,682 --> 00:32:53,504
- Here, try this.
- I can't eat that.

422
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,488
Picky, picky, picky.

423
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:57,505
Well, what do bears eat?

424
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:03,842
Fish. Bears eat fish.

425
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:08,894
All right, fishies, give it up for Boog!

426
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,909
Hey, Incredible Mister E.

427
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:30,341
Yes, Boogster?

428
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:33,887
- I gotta go.
- Well, go.

429
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:35,967
No, I need a toilet.

430
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:39,940
You know, the think tank.

431
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:43,455
The log cabin, the johnny
on the spot, the oval office.

432
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:46,854
- There's none of those things out here.
- Well, what do you do?

433
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,482
You know...

434
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:51,682
...I can't remember. But listen.

435
00:33:51,852 --> 00:33:57,385
Don't look now, but I see a little bush
with your name written all over it.

436
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,110
A bush? Are you serious?

437
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:01,220
Go on. It's just like riding a bicycle.

438
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,041
Only you're crapping on it.

439
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:08,295
Show us your "grr" face, nature boy.

440
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:23,750
Hey. What are you doing here?

441
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:25,383
Get out of here.

442
00:34:25,554 --> 00:34:28,816
I'm working here. Now, go.

443
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,278
All right, all right,
you've had your fun.

444
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:34,192
Nothing to see here.
Let the bear do his thing.

445
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:36,689
You believe those guys?

446
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:40,369
Finished?

447
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,764
I bet my nuts
that big hairy choob can't do it.

448
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:46,130
- I'll take a piece of that action.
- What is wrong with you animals?

449
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,538
Perhaps some roughage, buddy?

450
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:48,880
Buddy.

451
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,224
Perhaps some privacy.

452
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:52,693
- What are doing on my house?
- This is your house?

453
00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:54,032
Oh, l... I didn't know...

454
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,883
- It would be an improvement.
- What did you just say, Rosie?

455
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,990
Nothing. Why you gotta
be so sensitive?

456
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,364
- Boogster, what's the deal?
- You watch your mouth...

457
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:03,252
...or you'll get yourself in trouble.

458
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,457
You're just jealous
because you ain't got a man.

459
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,927
I don't know.
Some kind of chick fight.

460
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:09,527
Elliot, what do I do?

461
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,992
Well, that's easy.
You just gotta mark your territory.

462
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:14,391
- Show them who's boss.
- All right, ladies.

463
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:16,856
I'm laying down the law.

464
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:19,322
Unless, of course, they're skunks.

465
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,169
Disgusting.

466
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,168
Giselle.

467
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:33,014
Ridiculous.

468
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:40,060
The woods is no place for a bear.

469
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:42,135
Ducks? Okay.

470
00:35:42,303 --> 00:35:43,645
Look, don't move.

471
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,601
Oh, yeah. Sprucing up.

472
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:51,584
Quick. You guys gotta help me.

473
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:55,296
Don't mind Deni, monsieur.
He's a bit nervous.

474
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,313
Never been quite...

475
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,921
...right since the great migration.

476
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:07,131
There were thousands of us
when we started in the big V's.

477
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:11,040
Then... Then it happened.

478
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:12,863
What happened?

479
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:16,324
What happened?
Open season happened.

480
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:18,815
Just me and Deni were left.

481
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:22,244
How can you make a V
with only two duck, you ask, eh?

482
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:24,767
Well, you cannot, monsieur.

483
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,871
It's a tragedy!

484
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,749
Yeah, right, whatever.

485
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:33,091
But check this out.
I'm looking for town.

486
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:36,257
Okay? Now, could one of you guys
fly up there...

487
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:38,977
...and show me the way?
- Fly? Fly?

488
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:42,054
Quiet. They'll hear you.

489
00:36:43,306 --> 00:36:44,484
Giselle.

490
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:46,505
- Elliot?
- Hey, gorgeous.

491
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:49,384
- How you doing?
- Elliot, where have you been?

492
00:36:49,547 --> 00:36:51,970
Oh, you know. Big city.

493
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:55,489
Kind of a road trip. Saw the sights,
hit the buffet, took in a show.

494
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,123
Things are looking up, Giselle.

495
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:59,748
Really? I heard
you got hit by a truck.

496
00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:03,338
That... Rumor.

497
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,868
You better get out of here.
Remember what happened...

498
00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:08,135
...last time you talked to me?
- Is lan around?

499
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,704
How long have you had that tic?

500
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,494
I think it's getting worse.

501
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:17,930
Oh, crud.

502
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:24,524
Hello, "Smelliot."

503
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:28,465
I called him Smelliot.

504
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,647
Herd! Circle formation!

505
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,881
You pinheads. That's an oval.

506
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,702
More circle-y!

507
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:41,419
You got a lot of nerve
coming back here.

508
00:37:41,588 --> 00:37:44,785
- Why, thank you.
- That was not a compliment, maggot!

509
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:46,771
Well, he was just going.
Right, Elliot?

510
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,143
Yeah, lan.

511
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,692
I had to stop by and say hello
to some of my old pals.

512
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:53,772
Bob, Kevin. Jurgen,
how's the knee?

513
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:58,100
I told you to leave the herd
and never, ever, ever...

514
00:37:58,263 --> 00:38:01,744
- Never?
- Never, ever, ever come back.

515
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,373
Back?

516
00:38:03,832 --> 00:38:05,622
I'm not... I'm not back.

517
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:08,338
Me and my best buddy
are heading to town.

518
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:11,636
Yeah. I sure am gonna miss
you guys.

519
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,046
Off the upholstery!

520
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:16,024
What now?

521
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:25,909
So as I was saying,
never, ever, ever...

522
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:29,301
A bear! Bear. Bear. A bear.

523
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,565
Elliot, are you all right?

524
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:35,352
Buttermilk biscuit.

525
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,939
Hey, lan. Get a load of this.

526
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,452
Hey, cut it out.

527
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:41,884
Oh, I've heard of you.

528
00:38:42,046 --> 00:38:46,749
You're that bear that got
his butt thumped by a squirrel.

529
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:49,816
It was... There was 20 of them.

530
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:52,511
And they had nuts.

531
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,095
Don't listen to him, Boog.

532
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:58,015
Boog? What is that short for?

533
00:38:58,177 --> 00:39:00,317
- Booger?
- Booger!

534
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:03,679
- Listen, you!
- I'm all ears.

535
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:06,399
- Well...
- Boog, let's go.

536
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:10,466
You two are perfect for each other.

537
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:14,719
You're a loser and you're a loser-er.

538
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:16,602
Herd, let's bound!

539
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:19,904
Hey, Elliot.

540
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:22,437
I think you lost something.

541
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:25,820
Maybe it'll grow back. Bye, Elliot.

542
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,201
Yeah, see you.

543
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:31,196
See you later, backpack boy!

544
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,159
That's right, fool. You better run.

545
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:38,630
Keep on prancing,
you panty-waisted cow.

546
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,703
Yeah. One more word,
and I was gonna rack him.

547
00:39:40,872 --> 00:39:42,498
- That's right.
- I was waiting for it.

548
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,843
He's scared. He's scared.

549
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,214
- Look at him run. Look at him run.
- Yeah, I know it.

550
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:47,654
Look at him go.

551
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,120
Are you not gonna buy him a drink
before you kiss him?

552
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:52,617
You big jessie.

553
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:58,793
On your bikes,
you big numpties.

554
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:32,615
That was lan's girl
you was trying to talk to, huh?

555
00:40:35,026 --> 00:40:36,620
You dog.

556
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,942
Lan's right. I'm a loser.

557
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:42,634
- No, you're not a loser.
- Yes, I am.

558
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:44,462
- No, you're not.
- Yes.

559
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:48,077
Trust me. You know the day I met you,
lan kicked me out of the herd.

560
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:51,922
I lost my antler, I got run over
and tied to the hood of a truck.

561
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,362
What do you call that?

562
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:57,266
A loser. But check this out.

563
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,852
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

564
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,259
I look like a bear, I talk like a bear.

565
00:41:02,423 --> 00:41:05,904
But I can't fish, I can't climb a tree,
I can't even go in the woods.

566
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:09,519
That's nothing. Half doe.
Half buck. I'm a duck.

567
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:11,315
Hey, I ride a unicycle for crackers!

568
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,521
- I have a glass eye.
- I can't snap.

569
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,590
- I thought "log" was a color.
- I can't see my feet.

570
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:19,054
I killed a man.

571
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,928
Well, at least you've got a home.

572
00:41:30,931 --> 00:41:32,720
Home. Yeah.

573
00:41:32,883 --> 00:41:34,890
I sure hope so.

574
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:39,505
- Crimenently! Was that your neck?
- No.

575
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:44,592
My fishy crackers.
Oh, she still loves me.

576
00:41:44,757 --> 00:41:46,317
Thank you, Beth.

577
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:48,341
I'm coming home.

578
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:52,269
Try one, partner. Yeah.

579
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:55,156
Woo Hoo bars they ain't,
but they take you back.

580
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:56,945
You know? Remind you of home.

581
00:41:57,111 --> 00:41:59,664
Sweet, salty home.

582
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:07,382
Oh, yeah. To be back
in my own soft bed.

583
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:12,245
Eight square meals a day,
plus snacks.

584
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,233
Beth tucking me in every night.

585
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:16,984
It's like heaven to me.

586
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:23,799
You know,
when we get back home tomorrow...

587
00:42:23,964 --> 00:42:26,550
...l'm gonna make things right
with Beth.

588
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:30,295
And maybe, just maybe...

589
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:34,429
...we'll find a place
for you in the garage with me.

590
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,459
Sweet! Oh, yeah. I'm in the garage.

591
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:39,606
Who's staying in the garage?
I'm in the garage.

592
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:42,492
Who's got a place in the garage?
It's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah...

593
00:42:42,654 --> 00:42:44,313
- Hey, buddy?
- Yeah?

594
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,336
Do me a favor, will you?
It's gonna sound silly, but will you...?

595
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:50,879
- Ah, forget it.
- What?

596
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,601
Come on. I'm here for you.

597
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:56,697
Will you sing me
that "teddy-bear picnic" song?

598
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,865
Absolutely. The what song?

599
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:03,198
Well, Beth always sings it to me,
you know, because it helps me sleep.

600
00:43:03,362 --> 00:43:07,192
- Okay. I'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

601
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:12,609
Once there was a magical elf
Who lived in a rainbow tree

602
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:15,194
He lived downstairs
From a flatulent dwarf

603
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:17,187
Who was constantly having to pee

604
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,738
One day the elf could take no more

605
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:22,299
So he went and banged
On the rude dwarf's door

606
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:27,839
And what do you know
They suddenly both were married

607
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:34,212
Good night, Boog.

608
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:40,961
I'm sleeping in the garage.
I'm sleeping in the garage.

609
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:48,550
Come on, Mr. Weenie.
Beg. You can do it.

610
00:43:48,715 --> 00:43:50,754
Come on. Beg.

611
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:54,087
Bob, he won't listen.
Bob, show him how to beg.

612
00:44:06,638 --> 00:44:08,044
Dog worship.

613
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:10,312
Oh, my!

614
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:13,195
- You folks all right?
- What? No, no, no! He's...

615
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:14,820
Taken you hostage. I know, I know.

616
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:17,064
You're safe now.
I've got the enemy neutral...

617
00:44:17,903 --> 00:44:22,214
There, there, Mr. Weenie.
Are you all right, baby?

618
00:44:22,384 --> 00:44:25,866
You're the sweetest
little weenie I ever saw.

619
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:29,998
Don't be fooled. He's one of them.

620
00:44:30,706 --> 00:44:33,936
- Who?
- The enemy! The bear! That deer!

621
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:35,440
All them animals!

622
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:38,577
I have seen the future.

623
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:42,799
It will start in small towns
like Timberline.

624
00:44:43,924 --> 00:44:46,064
Soon, it'll spread.

625
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:52,688
They will invade from burrows,
caves, petting zoos.

626
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,619
If I don't stop them...

627
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:01,069
...it'll be a total reversal
of the natural order.

628
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:05,974
They laugh at old Shaw,
but you'll see.

629
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,432
The truth will be revealed.

630
00:45:09,593 --> 00:45:12,692
We know exactly what you mean.

631
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:15,705
- You do?
- We're scientists. Well, of sorts.

632
00:45:15,865 --> 00:45:18,616
And we're trying to secure
photographic documentation...

633
00:45:18,778 --> 00:45:22,008
...of a real, live homo-sasquatchus.

634
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:25,139
- Homo-say-what?
- We're looking for Bigfoot.

635
00:45:25,883 --> 00:45:31,252
Bigfoot...? I didn't realize
I was talking to a couple of wack jobs.

636
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:36,850
Don't trust him.
Pets are double agents.

637
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:40,699
The moment you turn your back,
he'll shiv you!

638
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:45,917
Oh, no, he can't. We had him fixed.

639
00:45:47,775 --> 00:45:49,434
Boog?

640
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:53,627
Boog. Are you awake?

641
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,317
- I am now.
- Awesome.

642
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,759
I was watching you sleep last night
and you were like a little angel.

643
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,832
Except for you're fat
and snoring like:

644
00:46:07,938 --> 00:46:09,368
We're gonna work on that, though.

645
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:11,994
I invented this cure
where you stick your whole hand...

646
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:14,585
...in your mouth.
- How long before we get to Timberline?

647
00:46:15,204 --> 00:46:17,790
Oh, by nightfall. Easy.

648
00:46:17,957 --> 00:46:19,266
Are you sure?

649
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:21,251
Absolutely.

650
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:23,966
Hey, you wanna see
something stupid?

651
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:28,644
Well, then we better get going.

652
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:32,003
Right. We're on a tight schedule.
I'll carry your load.

653
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,793
Oh, no. Whoa, wait.

654
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:37,375
Look, you gotta be real careful with
him, okay, because he's real delicate.

655
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:42,369
Want a fishy cracker?

656
00:46:44,073 --> 00:46:47,489
No. I'll eat when I get home.

657
00:46:49,034 --> 00:46:50,016
Listen, girlfriend.

658
00:46:50,186 --> 00:46:52,936
You wanna find a man like my Ignacio,
you gotta check your look.

659
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:55,782
What are you saying? I'm black
and white. I go with everything.

660
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:58,249
You go fine with everybody.
Maybe that's your problem.

661
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:01,313
- Ain't those the same two skunks...
- I had some thoughts on the show.

662
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:03,459
- My show?
- The lady in the shorts has gotta go.

663
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:07,011
She's slowing us down. It's gotta
be fresh, new. I want some jazz.

664
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:10,215
I'm the star, and the people out there
come to see me...

665
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:11,691
...a grizzly bear.

666
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:15,531
I see.

667
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:19,557
You get to have the career while
I stay home and look after Dinkleman!

668
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:21,735
He's not even mine!

669
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,226
I don't get to have a dream.
Is that it?

670
00:47:27,184 --> 00:47:29,290
Buddy.

671
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:33,804
Don't you think
I might like a little singing...

672
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,491
...a little dancing, a little:
- Elliot.

673
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:40,619
But no. All I ever hear is, "How long
until we get to Timberline, simple?

674
00:47:40,787 --> 00:47:43,603
- How long until we get home?"
- Elliot! Are those the same beavers?

675
00:47:43,763 --> 00:47:48,467
- No. All beavers look alike.
- Hey! Tiny dancer!

676
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:50,768
Yeah, that's right! Shake it, shake it!

677
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:53,776
- Let's see some moves!
- Elliot!

678
00:47:53,941 --> 00:47:54,988
Yeah.

679
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:59,282
Elliot, this is the same dang dam.
We've been going in circles!

680
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:02,230
Circle. One time around.

681
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,976
You don't even know
where we're going.

682
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,265
Got them, Lorraine!

683
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:19,058
- What was that?
- Hunters?

684
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:23,503
- What are they doing up here?
- Okay, boys. Take cover!

685
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,601
- Boog, we gotta hide.
- I'm out of here.

686
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:31,283
Boog, wait! Don't go out there!

687
00:48:31,452 --> 00:48:35,446
Hey, tubby, stop! Hey,
this ain't a load-bearing structure!

688
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,479
Oh, that's bad.

689
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:48,604
Rosie, in here.

690
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:07,161
- Stop. Get off.
- Buddy, buddy, buddy!

691
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,989
Crud.

692
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,424
Shaw!

693
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:29,243
Dinkleman!

694
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,463
You're gonna be okay!

695
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:37,500
We're gonna die and you know it.

696
00:49:42,056 --> 00:49:44,839
No one around here
to save you this time, boys!

697
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:47,715
Paddle, Boog! Paddle!

698
00:49:50,473 --> 00:49:53,059
Grab a boulder! Grab a boulder!

699
00:49:53,226 --> 00:49:55,845
Left, left. Right!

700
00:49:56,362 --> 00:49:57,792
Oh, like you know.

701
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:04,998
Where is he?

702
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:07,815
He's gone. Oh, there he is.

703
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:10,949
No, wait. There he is. There he is.

704
00:50:11,373 --> 00:50:12,780
- Why, you little...
- There he is.

705
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:14,371
Quiet, I'm trying to drive.

706
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:21,833
Faster, Boog!

707
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,807
Like fishing and hunting
at the same time.

708
00:50:39,154 --> 00:50:42,832
- Give me a hand, Boog! Hold me!
- Stop. Get off! Elliot, get off. Get off!

709
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,680
Stop!

710
00:51:25,274 --> 00:51:27,130
Dinkleman?

711
00:51:43,836 --> 00:51:46,804
You. You did this.

712
00:51:46,974 --> 00:51:48,567
- Yeah, that's right.
- What did I do?

713
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:50,589
You dragged us down
to the hunting grounds.

714
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,817
- Yeah, where are we gonna hide?
- We're sitting ducks out here.

715
00:51:53,982 --> 00:51:55,357
And it's open season!

716
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,302
All right, all right. That's enough.

717
00:51:58,464 --> 00:52:00,057
Guys, it's not his fault.

718
00:52:00,224 --> 00:52:02,232
Oh, you're right, Elliot. It's your fault.

719
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:03,738
- My fault?
- Yeah.

720
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:06,201
If it weren't for you
I'd be home right now.

721
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:07,863
None of this
would've ever happened.

722
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:10,717
You said you knew the way back,
but you lied.

723
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:14,334
L... No.

724
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:16,033
Okay.

725
00:52:16,195 --> 00:52:18,018
Okay, maybe...

726
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:21,151
I thought if you hung out with me
then maybe you would like me.

727
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:24,578
Oh, man. I trusted you, Elliot.

728
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,716
I'm sorry, Boog.

729
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:29,083
We're still partners, right?

730
00:52:29,253 --> 00:52:31,905
You know, Elliot, I'm better off alone.

731
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:34,917
What about us?

732
00:52:35,078 --> 00:52:36,965
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what about us?

733
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:39,200
Us? There's no us.

734
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:42,629
You're not my problem.
And you? We're done.

735
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,759
- But... Boog, wait.
- Done.

736
00:54:10,198 --> 00:54:12,500
- Oh, no.
- Thanks for the license, Gordy.

737
00:54:12,663 --> 00:54:14,354
All right, guys. Good luck.

738
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:18,610
- Hey, Earl. That a new truck?
- Yeah. Check it out. Jealous much?

739
00:54:20,153 --> 00:54:21,462
You okay?

740
00:54:21,624 --> 00:54:23,927
I put him way above the falls.

741
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,355
I hope I did the right thing.

742
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:30,865
Don't worry, Beth. I'm sure Boog
is happy in his new home.

743
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:35,062
Stupid nature.

744
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:38,994
Civilization.

745
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,750
Hello?

746
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:49,365
Excuse me. Is anybody home?

747
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,388
Oh, sweet porcelain.

748
00:55:07,073 --> 00:55:10,106
And the crowd goes wild!

749
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:15,645
Now, there's gotta be
a fridge in here somewhere.

750
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:09,093
Oh, no.

751
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:13,416
Deers, skunks, beavers.

752
00:56:14,028 --> 00:56:16,265
I gotta hide.

753
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:21,320
That bear's turned them all.

754
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:36,616
Here you go, Lorraine.
There, you get good and dry.

755
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:40,527
Come morning,
we got a rebellion to crush.

756
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:44,358
And then I'm gonna
take back what's mine!

757
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,439
Elliot.

758
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:54,640
Someone's been eating my candy.

759
00:57:00,532 --> 00:57:02,736
Somebody's been sitting in my chair.

760
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,252
Somebody forgot to flush!

761
00:57:15,575 --> 00:57:18,642
And he's still here.

762
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:23,795
Come back for your bear,
Goldilocks?

763
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,905
Ready or not, here I come!

764
00:57:40,347 --> 00:57:46,840
If you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise

765
00:57:48,061 --> 00:57:55,219
If you go out in the woods today
You better go in disguise

766
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,998
'Cause every bear
That ever there was

767
00:58:00,031 --> 00:58:04,669
Was gathered there
Together because

768
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:09,082
Today's the day
The teddy bears have

769
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:13,722
Their picnic!

770
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:44,928
Hey, bear! There ain't nowhere
that you can hide from me!

771
00:58:52,936 --> 00:58:54,659
As soon as I get mine:

772
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:56,738
Blowing their heads off!

773
00:58:56,904 --> 00:58:58,246
Good time.

774
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:21,635
Elliot.

775
00:59:32,398 --> 00:59:34,700
No buddy.

776
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:50,796
Elliot, you've gotta hide.

777
00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:54,377
The hunters are here.

778
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,602
He's gonna give us away.

779
01:00:09,236 --> 01:00:12,107
All right! Bring it! Bring it!

780
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:14,126
- Boog?
- Hey, buddy.

781
01:00:14,294 --> 01:00:15,669
What are you doing back here?

782
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,805
Come on. I couldn't go home
without my partner.

783
01:00:17,975 --> 01:00:19,884
- I don't have a partner.
- Elliot.

784
01:00:20,054 --> 01:00:23,055
I don't need the herd
and I don't need you.

785
01:00:23,222 --> 01:00:24,652
So leave me alone.

786
01:00:25,976 --> 01:00:27,569
Ain't gonna be able to do it.

787
01:00:27,736 --> 01:00:29,679
You see, I already saved you once.

788
01:00:29,848 --> 01:00:33,711
That makes me responsible for you.

789
01:00:33,882 --> 01:00:37,330
I saw that. Come on.
Let me hear you say it. Partners.

790
01:00:37,498 --> 01:00:39,505
- No.
- What was that?

791
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:42,489
- I guess we can be partners.
- Sorry, I can't hear you.

792
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:44,538
I said I guess we can be partners.

793
01:00:46,107 --> 01:00:48,661
- Partners!
- Partners!

794
01:00:49,116 --> 01:00:51,222
Okeydokey. This way.

795
01:00:51,388 --> 01:00:54,389
- This way.
- Right. Maybe you better lead.

796
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:58,102
Yeah. Let's get back to the garage,
where it's safe.

797
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,474
- Safe?
- Safe?

798
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:07,028
Hey, Boog. How many animals
can fit in the garage?

799
01:01:07,198 --> 01:01:08,213
How many...?

800
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,549
Hello, Boog.

801
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,335
So where you all headed?

802
01:01:14,496 --> 01:01:18,109
- To the safe place.
- This land of garage.

803
01:01:18,273 --> 01:01:21,023
- With buddy.
- Come on. You owe us, Tiny.

804
01:01:21,186 --> 01:01:22,593
- Yeah!
- Yeah! That's right!

805
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:25,983
Yeah, I'm sorry about the dam.

806
01:01:26,146 --> 01:01:30,937
And how I messed you all up,
you know. My bad.

807
01:01:31,107 --> 01:01:34,556
So you're taking us with you,
right, Booger?

808
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,408
Please? Please.

809
01:01:37,572 --> 01:01:42,079
Look at me. I'm too pretty to die!

810
01:01:42,885 --> 01:01:44,707
Well, maybe...

811
01:01:46,822 --> 01:01:48,316
No! No! No!

812
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:50,242
You ain't leaving without us.

813
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:51,967
I didn't mean to call you Booger.

814
01:01:52,135 --> 01:01:55,681
- Can we take Giselle?
- Wait! Let me think.

815
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,429
Hunters.

816
01:01:59,047 --> 01:02:02,562
Dang. Nobody's going home tonight.

817
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:04,289
There's so many of them.

818
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:06,497
That's it, then.

819
01:02:06,666 --> 01:02:08,837
No more me.

820
01:02:11,786 --> 01:02:13,991
I guess I will be mounted on a wall.

821
01:02:17,772 --> 01:02:19,943
Oh, no, you won't.

822
01:02:20,108 --> 01:02:22,497
Now, when I'm a bearskin rug,
they can walk all over me.

823
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:25,636
But until that happens,
I ain't going out without a fight.

824
01:02:25,901 --> 01:02:27,078
- What?
- Fight?

825
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:29,317
- The F word?
- That's right.

826
01:02:29,485 --> 01:02:31,046
One thing you all have taught me...

827
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,602
...the woods is a messed-up,
dangerous place.

828
01:02:35,726 --> 01:02:39,917
And y'all are crazy. You've been
kicking my butt for the last two days.

829
01:02:40,463 --> 01:02:41,412
Yeah, I kind of did.

830
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:42,762
- I didn't.
- Sorry.

831
01:02:42,928 --> 01:02:45,165
So let's do to them
what you've been doing to me.

832
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:48,677
Now, I say we give our guests
the full outdoor experience.

833
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,507
Yeah!

834
01:02:50,673 --> 01:02:54,121
Hey! Is this a private fight
or can anybody join?

835
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:56,395
Because McSquizzy wants in.

836
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:59,217
Good. Because we'll need your nuts.

837
01:02:59,378 --> 01:03:01,867
- And your acorns too.
- What's the plan, Boog?

838
01:03:02,035 --> 01:03:04,206
Oh, we gonna run
those yahoos back to town.

839
01:03:04,372 --> 01:03:08,683
Yeah, baby. When we get through
with them, they won't ever come back.

840
01:03:12,757 --> 01:03:15,921
So you think you're so tough, huh?

841
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:20,171
Well, you know what I think?

842
01:03:20,343 --> 01:03:23,955
I think you're still
just a mama's bear.

843
01:03:31,992 --> 01:03:34,927
You guard the fort, Mr. Weenie.
Mama's gonna take a dip.

844
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,540
That's good.
Mama's getting kind of gamey.

845
01:03:39,705 --> 01:03:43,350
Come on, Bob. There's gonna be
a full moon out tonight.

846
01:03:50,044 --> 01:03:52,532
- Sorry.
- Come on. Let's go.

847
01:04:01,085 --> 01:04:02,263
Boog?

848
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,354
Oh, yeah.

849
01:04:08,766 --> 01:04:11,996
- Maria, let go.
- I'll carry it.

850
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:13,850
It's empty.

851
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,226
Ladies.

852
01:04:15,392 --> 01:04:18,109
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

853
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:23,543
This is gonna be great.

854
01:04:26,498 --> 01:04:28,735
You. We gonna need more ducks.

855
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,287
Elliot, is that chocolate on your face?

856
01:04:31,459 --> 01:04:33,019
No.

857
01:04:34,819 --> 01:04:36,761
- It's a pet.
- He's gonna blow our cover.

858
01:04:40,612 --> 01:04:43,678
I've been living a lie!

859
01:04:44,357 --> 01:04:47,226
Please, take me with you.

860
01:05:12,202 --> 01:05:15,399
Hey, Boog. You're not still mad
about that backpack thing, are you?

861
01:05:15,562 --> 01:05:19,688
Oh, no. I never hold a grudge.
I just let them go.

862
01:05:20,747 --> 01:05:21,695
What was that?

863
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,405
It's the signal.

864
01:05:30,188 --> 01:05:33,255
Okay, Deni. Let's round them up!

865
01:05:33,421 --> 01:05:36,171
All right, ladies. Let her rip!

866
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:48,486
- Gas mask.
- Got it!

867
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:55,083
My pants!

868
01:05:56,434 --> 01:05:58,288
Good job, Reilly. All right.

869
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,003
Time to run
these guys back to town.

870
01:06:01,938 --> 01:06:03,149
Are you ready for this?

871
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:07,822
- This is awkward.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

872
01:06:10,388 --> 01:06:12,723
- Can I?
- Go for it, Smelliot.

873
01:06:12,884 --> 01:06:14,957
Charge!

874
01:06:16,949 --> 01:06:20,081
Holy stampede! It's a stampede!

875
01:06:20,565 --> 01:06:22,802
All right. Show me your "grr" face!

876
01:06:25,366 --> 01:06:26,959
Now, let's kick
some hunter bahookie!

877
01:06:28,983 --> 01:06:30,740
Bob, we've been robbed!

878
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,879
And they took Mr. Weenie!

879
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:36,504
Come on, mate!
Move them pudgy wee legs!

880
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:39,250
I feel so alive!

881
01:06:39,672 --> 01:06:41,909
Drop antlers!

882
01:06:51,355 --> 01:06:52,533
Bless me.

883
01:06:56,859 --> 01:06:59,414
No! No!

884
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:02,263
How you doing, partner?

885
01:07:02,429 --> 01:07:05,496
Boog, this is great.
Let's do this every year.

886
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:15,130
No, no! Get that bill away from me.

887
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,980
Fire!

888
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,041
Guys, let's get out of here!

889
01:07:39,076 --> 01:07:40,253
Sheriff! Sheriff!

890
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:43,649
The animals are going wild,
and the bear is their leader!

891
01:07:44,772 --> 01:07:46,081
It's for you.

892
01:07:47,973 --> 01:07:49,567
Gordy, I'm bringing him home.

893
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:52,384
Come on, men!
They're just animals.

894
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:56,064
Elliot, catch.

895
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,133
Got it.

896
01:08:00,008 --> 01:08:02,047
Present arms!

897
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,074
Yeah!

898
01:08:09,192 --> 01:08:10,622
Fire!

899
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:13,383
Oh, my God!

900
01:08:14,729 --> 01:08:15,907
Back to the trucks!

901
01:08:16,074 --> 01:08:17,962
Boog, it's working.

902
01:08:18,122 --> 01:08:19,649
Yeah. Look at them run.

903
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:22,186
- Send in Mr. Happy!
- Who?

904
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:24,970
Go, go, go!

905
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:29,414
Adieu!

906
01:08:33,805 --> 01:08:35,496
Mr. Happy didn't go off.

907
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:38,181
Hey, whoa. We're just supposed
to run them into town.

908
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:42,955
Well, it's time for them
to start running, isn't it?

909
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:51,853
Hey, Earl, ain't that your truck?

910
01:08:53,584 --> 01:08:55,144
That's a bummer.

911
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,429
That's right. Keep running.

912
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:11,631
Sweet.

913
01:09:11,795 --> 01:09:13,683
Freedom!

914
01:09:28,086 --> 01:09:31,403
Hello, Goldilocks.

915
01:09:31,576 --> 01:09:32,786
What?

916
01:09:34,744 --> 01:09:36,304
Bull's-eye!

917
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:42,929
Quick! We need more ammo.

918
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:49,139
Elliot! Elliot, stop helping me.

919
01:09:49,306 --> 01:09:52,535
- Keep it coming.
- Okay. Let's see how you like it.

920
01:09:53,243 --> 01:09:54,901
A pillow? Oh, come on!

921
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,922
More! More!

922
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,170
All right.

923
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,089
Come on, mama's bear.

924
01:10:04,252 --> 01:10:07,187
You can do better than that.
Let's see what you got.

925
01:10:08,445 --> 01:10:09,690
Come on.

926
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:12,888
Boog!

927
01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:22,108
Oh, yeah. Don't mess
with the Boogster. Fore!

928
01:10:23,839 --> 01:10:25,596
All right, Lorraine.

929
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,444
Let's kiss this bear good night.

930
01:10:51,236 --> 01:10:53,473
No! No! Stop!

931
01:11:01,574 --> 01:11:02,982
Elliot?

932
01:11:08,008 --> 01:11:09,381
Buddy?

933
01:11:14,376 --> 01:11:16,580
Oh, Elliot.

934
01:11:20,778 --> 01:11:22,753
You all right, Elliot?

935
01:11:24,202 --> 01:11:26,723
I'm a little lightheaded.

936
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:32,999
Hey, Tiny. Nice show.

937
01:11:33,612 --> 01:11:36,363
- Behold, the mighty grizzly.
- Boog, Boog, Boog.

938
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,579
- Let's get him!
- What? No!

939
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:45,132
- Stay away! No!
- Here you go.

940
01:11:45,294 --> 01:11:47,596
Cannonball!

941
01:11:48,879 --> 01:11:51,214
You know, Elliot,
this place ain't so bad.

942
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:52,902
Hold that thought. Oh, yeah.

943
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:55,341
Karate noises!

944
01:12:07,986 --> 01:12:08,934
No.

945
01:12:13,683 --> 01:12:16,618
- Beth?
- Boog?

946
01:12:28,213 --> 01:12:29,391
Oh, Boog.

947
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:31,565
- What's he doing?
- Is he not gonna maul her?

948
01:12:31,735 --> 01:12:35,314
No. She's his mom.
She's taking us home.

949
01:12:35,478 --> 01:12:37,104
Every buddy?

950
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:41,200
I was so worried.
I'm bringing you back with me.

951
01:12:41,368 --> 01:12:43,310
Come on. Let's go home.

952
01:13:10,109 --> 01:13:12,345
Oh, no.

953
01:13:16,477 --> 01:13:18,682
Come on, Boog. Let's go home.

954
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,597
Boog?

955
01:13:43,107 --> 01:13:44,601
You are home.

956
01:13:49,956 --> 01:13:52,095
I'm so proud of you.

957
01:13:53,764 --> 01:13:57,758
So how are we both
gonna fit in the helicopter?

958
01:13:57,925 --> 01:13:59,387
- She's coming back, right?
- Who?

959
01:13:59,557 --> 01:14:01,347
The shorts lady. Boog?

960
01:14:01,702 --> 01:14:03,458
- Hey, big guy.
- What's up, Tiny?

961
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:04,899
- What's up?
- You said that we...

962
01:14:05,062 --> 01:14:06,623
- You're judging me?
- How y'all doing?

963
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:07,904
- Hey, Boog.
- Hi, Boog.

964
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:10,405
I know he's a duck.
But he treats me like a lady.

965
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:11,746
- But she's...
- Hey, buddy.

966
01:14:11,911 --> 01:14:14,562
- Hey, find me some food.
- Come on. What is our pickup time?

967
01:14:14,728 --> 01:14:17,859
Elliot, we're staying here.
This is our home.

968
01:14:18,024 --> 01:14:21,058
These are our people.
This is where we reside.

969
01:14:21,225 --> 01:14:22,916
What? Are you insane?

970
01:14:23,081 --> 01:14:24,969
Where have you been
for the last two days?

971
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:28,513
This place is horrible. Horrible!

972
01:14:28,682 --> 01:14:31,334
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, lan?

973
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:36,104
Come on, Elliot. It ain't that bad.

974
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:39,017
She's at least gonna bring
some Woo Hoo bars, right?

975
01:14:39,181 --> 01:14:40,839
It's just the two of us, Elliot.

976
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:42,827
Unless you plan
on going back to your herd.

977
01:14:42,989 --> 01:14:45,771
What? And break up the team?
Bros before does.

978
01:14:45,934 --> 01:14:47,788
Yeah. Bros before does.

979
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,989
Hello, Elliot.

980
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:51,816
Catch you later, Boog.

981
01:14:57,871 --> 01:15:01,800
Hey! Get off my trees,
you bucktoothed sporran!

982
01:15:03,344 --> 01:15:05,733
Feels like home, baby.

983
01:15:05,906 --> 01:15:07,466
Hey, Boog!

984
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:11,088
- Rabbit fight!
- Oh, no, you didn't.

985
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,738
Oh, yeah? Well, eat rabbit.

986
01:15:14,547 --> 01:15:15,889
Hey, buddy.

987
01:15:40,759 --> 01:15:41,937
Bob! Bob!

988
01:15:48,728 --> 01:15:52,657
A real live homo-sasquatchus.

989
01:15:55,738 --> 01:15:59,895
Wait, wait. No. No. No!

990
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:11,680
THE END
