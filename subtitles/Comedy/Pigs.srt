1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,705
Cleaver: She's going,
"I can't, I can't"

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,505
I'm like, "Come on,
Patty, why not?"

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,410
And then she says,
"Because my teeth are jagged"

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,313
What a fuckin' freak,
can you believe that shit?

5
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,751
What was she doing down there
if she wasn't going to put it in?

6
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,150
Hey, Miles

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,424
Miles: Gentlemen, I have just
enjoyed my first threesome

8
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,198
Various:
Ooh's and Aaah's

9
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,772
Whoo!

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,842
Are these the Quinn twins?

11
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,901
You son of a bitch, you got double teamed
by the fabulous Quinn twins

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,449
Dude, you been
on such a wicked tear lately, man

13
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,420
Weren't you with that blonde
fuckin' hottie just last week?

14
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,253
That's right, Tommy
Debbie Zimmerman

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,293
Wasn't her box
completely shaved?

16
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,522
He likes the clean biscuit

17
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,064
Miles:
You don't mind it either

18
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,726
Tommy: What about that freaky-ass chick
from a couple weeks ago?

19
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,065
- Anita Kahn
- Anita Kahn

20
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,901
She had a stellar body

21
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,170
Cleaver: Gave you all three
inputs if I recall

22
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,336
Nothin' wrong with a little
mud on the old helmet

23
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,089
Cleaver:
Miles, Anita Kahn

24
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,892
Is that Kahn
as in James Caan,

25
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,398
or Kahn as in wrath of?

26
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,059
Wrath of, why?

27
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,200
Well, Quinn, Zimmerman, Kahn

28
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,466
The "Q","Z", and the "K",

29
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,270
those gotta be the most difficult letters
in the whole alphabet Right?

30
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,343
I guess

31
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,646
Look, I gotta get this down on paper,
while it's still fresh

32
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,020
I'll see you strugglers later

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,357
You still keep a record
of every chick he bangs?

34
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,727
Oh yeah, bangs,
hummers, hand jobs, ass play,

35
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,356
you name it
It's all in the journals

36
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,458
Fuck, dude, how does he do it?

37
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,336
Some guys
they're just born with it

38
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,400
And the rest of us well, we have to
wait around for the jagged tooth retards

39
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,681
Adios, ladies

40
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,774
Hey, don't lock me out again

41
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,078
Cleaver:
Fuck off!

42
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,218
Miles:
Oh Ben, I'm sorry

43
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,323
Nice! Snappin' one off, are we?

44
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,565
Leave him alone!

45
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,067
Big deal, like he's the only one
that's beatin' his eggs in this place?

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,899
It is a big deal to him

47
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,302
All right?
He's not like you, thank God

48
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,931
He's shy

49
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,907
Cleaver: And is that
my fuckin' problem? Come on, Miles

50
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,172
That fuckin' pussy has gotta start acting
like one of the guys sooner or later

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,249
Miles: Yeah, I know, but just don't
bust his balls when he comes back

52
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,285
Yes, Mom
Can I see the picture again?

53
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,718
Are you going to bust his balls?

54
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,654
No No!

55
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,359
Don't lick it!

56
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,396
CMFU, Campus Radio

57
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:29,271
Cleaver: In less than a month,
you railed a "Q", a "Z" and a "K"

58
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,775
I still can't get over that

59
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,573
Miles:
Yup

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,046
You know with those
letters out of the way,

61
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,541
you could probably hoink the entire alphabet
before you graduate

62
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,449
I mean, If you haven't already

63
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,547
Who was before the Kahn?

64
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,694
Let's see what
the good book has to say

65
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,433
We had Tanya Anderson,
Debbie Spinoza;

66
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,801
before that we had
Marcia Springer and Sue

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,035
HmmSue, uh Sutinsky

68
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,373
I gotta write slower,
but it definitely starts with an "S"

69
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,448
Okay, so that's like three "S"s
Okay what a waste

70
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,380
Who would have thought
the "S"s were such sluts

71
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,610
Hmm

72
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,311
Why don't you do it, man?

73
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,482
Why don't you do
the entire alphabet?

74
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,787
Fuck off!

75
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,225
No, no, just listen, listen

76
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,787
Using your books, and some of
those pictures that you've taken,

77
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:31,026
we figure out which letters
you've already gotten since, like, first semester

78
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,004
Then we figure out which letters
you have to get before you graduate,

79
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,268
I don't know, to make it complete

80
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,502
And what for?

81
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,205
Because we could parlay
a poontang quest like this

82
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,806
into some major coin,
that's what for

83
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,552
You mean actually
take bets on this?

84
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,146
Hell yeah

85
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,717
You know,
don't take this the wrong way,

86
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,423
but I don't think I want to get involved
in any of your gimmicks

87
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,993
Fuck, Miles!

88
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,964
Is it the battery?

89
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,236
It's the battery

90
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,161
Do you know
what you're doing?

91
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,961
I like to think so

92
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,701
Here, hand me that file

93
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,095
Thanks

94
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,111
Here, try that,
that should work

95
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,045
Try that, that should work

96
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,056
You should really get
the battery replaced

97
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,620
Yeah, I've been told
I should get the battery

98
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,926
replaced

99
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,531
Thanks

100
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,304
Cleaver: Now, there are two months left
before Miles graduates,

101
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,369
and according to his diaries,
these are the letters he's already gotten

102
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,312
And these are the ten letters
he has yet to get

103
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,749
Now there will be an overall bet
whether he completes the whole alphabet or not

104
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,286
Those are 30 to 1 odds,

105
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,948
as well as side bets
for each individual letter

106
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,617
The tougher the letter,
the greater the odds

107
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,421
Who decides
which are the tough letters?

108
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,393
Common sense does

109
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,433
Okay, names starting
with "M"s and "N"s,

110
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,332
they're a lot more common
than those starting with "U"s and "V"s,

111
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,929
so "U"s and "V"s
would be the tougher letters

112
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,407
And let us not forget the
mother of all tough letters,

113
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,445
the dreaded "X"

114
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,640
I think it'd be impossible to meet an "X",
let alone fuck one,

115
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,273
so the odds on the "X"
are already 10 to 1

116
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,181
Am I going too fast
for anyone here?

117
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,514
Big Eddie:
If you're serious,

118
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,021
I definitely want in on this action

119
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,523
Cleaver:
I'm glad to hear that, but, uh

120
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:11,120
there's just one, teeny,
weenie little setback

121
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,197
What's that?

122
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,892
Miles ain't exactly agreed
to do this yet

123
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,595
Okay, let me get this straight

124
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,536
You want me to carry a camera
with me at all times,

125
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,301
no matter where I go,

126
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,605
find girls whose last names
start with specific letters of the alphabet,

127
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,770
have sex with them,

128
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,713
and either talk them into
letting me take their picture,

129
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,307
or if they're not into it

130
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,147
wait around till
they've fallen asleep,

131
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,950
then very quietly take a picture of them
without waking them up,

132
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,857
and then bring the picture back here
as proof for you strugglers

133
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,952
Yeah, is that going
to be a problem for you?

134
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,531
No, I just wanted to
make sure I got it straight

135
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,691
I can't believe I'm
actually witnessing this

136
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,770
Hey, even if you ain't bettin',
Mr Nice guy,

137
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,031
you gotta keep your mouth shut

138
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,106
Ben:
Says who?

139
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,970
Big Eddie:
Says me, bitch

140
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,912
All right, gentlemen,

141
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,983
let the games begin!

142
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,395
<i># When I walked the hot ass fucks</i>

143
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,731
<i># And they go all the way</i>

144
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,602
<i># When I talk the chicks all gawk</i>

145
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,165
<i># 'Cause they just wanna play</i>

146
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,908
<i># As for me</i>

147
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,447
<i># It's all about quality</i>

148
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,984
<i># Easily</i>

149
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,526
<i># I'll do 'em from "A" to "Z"</i>

150
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,622
<i># When skirts drop I open shop</i>

151
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,358
<i># And night turns into day</i>

152
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,736
<i># Four feet under my sheets...</i>

153
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,863
Miles:
Gentlemen,

154
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,636
I'd like to introduce you
to someone

155
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,109
The "O"

156
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,941
Any way you look at it,
it's still an "O"

157
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,537

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,197
Miles:
In all the letters,

175
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,705
this is going to be the bitch
of the bunch

176
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,338
So, let me see
if I got these names right

177
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,472
- You're Tiffany Smith, right?
- Yep

178
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,847
And your friend here
is Michelle Noonan?

179
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,317
- Noonan, yeah
- Michelle Noonan?

180
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,047
Now that's not with a "G"
or a "P" or anything, is it?

181
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,089
No! It's "N", for Noonan

182
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,317
"N" for Noonan

183
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,386
Miles:
Need 'em Got em Got em

184
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,931
Need 'em Got 'em Got 'em

185
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,132
Time

186
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,244
Man: Don't forget, everyone,
Friday's tutorial is cancelled

187
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:50,406
Please read chapters 9 through 11,
they will be on the test

188
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,688
Excuse me?

189
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,759
Yes?

190
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:05,928
Um I was just wondering if, uh

191
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,935
if you knew
if we had a tutorial on Friday

192
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,673
No, the prof said it was cancelled

193
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,766
Oh, that's right, he did, didn't he?

194
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,538
Oh, I'm Ben

195
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,045
Gabrielle Nice to meet you, Ben

196
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,147
Oh wait! I think you forgot your book!

197
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,662
<i>Man on TV: It's guaranteed
to put the fire back in your firearm!</i>

198
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,193
<i>Sergeant Rock-Dick gives you
a major woody in your private parts.</i>

199
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,329
Miles:
That was a complete waste of sweat

200
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,806
Not one decent piece of tail
in the entire gym

201
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,707
Cleaver:
Oh, I'm sorry, brother

202
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,006
Guess what?
I made new charts

203
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,104
Miles:
Yeah, you're missing the "P"

204
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,547
What?

205
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,281
Miles: The "P"
Yeah, I railed her a while back

206
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,891
She was between the "C"
and the "I"

207
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,356
What the hell is that?

208
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,293
That is a wicked shit
I took while you were in class

209
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,829
I thought you might
want to see it

210
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,489
That's disgusting

211
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,362
There she is The "P"

212
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,958
She's been hounding me
ever since

213
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,094
Oh, send that nag my way,
I'll do her silly

214
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,332
She ain't worth the hassle
Pass me a highlighter

215
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,799
- Here you go
- Thanks

216
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,137
So, any new prospects?

217
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,734
Miles:
I'm seeing an "N" tonight

218
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,575
- Nice
- Yeah

219
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,707
"N" being for Whoa!

220
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,513
Chewbacca,
what's with all the fur?

221
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,644
What are you talking about?

222
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,245
Cleaver:
Uh, your pubes man,

223
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,448
Don't you trim 'em up?

224
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,546
Ben:
No

225
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,216
Well, you should, sasquatch

226
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,959
Why the hell would I do that?

227
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,191
Aside from the obvious,
because chicks dig it, that's why

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,024
You're nuts

229
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,330
What do you need all
that extra padding down there for, anyways?

230
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,428
Oh, I forgot,
excessive masturbation

231
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,563
Fuck off, Cleaver!

232
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,765
Fuck off, Cleaver!

233
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,274
Miles, does he always
have to be here?

234
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,343
Miles, does he always
have to be here?

235
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,105
Look if you're so in fuckin' love with him
why don't you move in?

236
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,179
Hey!

237
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,883
Cleaver: Fuck, I'm just trying
to help the guyout, okay?

238
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,421
Fine, you tell him, because Chia-dick here
thinks it's still 1979

239
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,158
In his disturbed way,
Cleaver does have a point, Benny

240
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,624
I mean,
all the guys are trimming it up

241
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:20,529
Girls have been doing it forever
and now they expect the favour to be returned

242
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,766
Nah, you guys you guys
are just fucking with me,

243
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,566
you want me you want me
to shave down there

244
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,403
so that you can tell all the guys
and they'll make fun of me

245
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,883
<i>Something's gonna begin...</i>

246
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,918
Cleaver:
Loose now, motherfucker!

247
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,987
Jesus!

248
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,389
Cleaver:
What?

249
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,922
My pouch, look how smooth it is,
It's nice, right?

250
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,392
It looks like raw turkey

251
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,190
Oh, it fuckin' does

252
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,799
Ben:
You're sick!

253
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,866
Cleaver:
Oh, I'm sick

254
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,628
Okay, If a chick's going
to lick a ball sack,

255
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,362
do you think she's going
to like this

256
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,960
or your fucking bird's nest?

257
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,731
Ben: This is by far the gayest
fucking day of my life

258
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,005
Okay, it's not gay,
Benji, it's physics

259
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,309
Come on, Benny,

260
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,613
a confident hetero shouldn't be afraid
to whip out the old yam bag to prove a point

261
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,013
Does part of being a confident hetero

262
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,521
mean you have to sleep with
26 different women for money?

263
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,285
Uh, I'm just trying to help
you out Fuck

264
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:34,232
Oh my God, look at
the water spots all over my glass

265
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,602
You know, Michelle, if you
want to go somewhere else we can just

266
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,341
No, it's okay
I'm sure it's clean

267
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,882
It's spotty, but clean

268
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,111
Waiter:
Is this a better table?

269
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,948
Mmm

270
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,146
May I take your drink order?

271
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,957
Michelle?

272
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,991
I'll have a white wine spritzer

273
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,721
Oh, with Sprite, not soda
Sprite

274
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,096
A glass of your house red, please

275
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,826
Red wine?

276
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,095
That's so gross,
it totally stains your teeth

277
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,497
Michelle:
Can we order dinner now?

278
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,574
Of course

279
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,973
Miles, you go first,
I'm still looking at the menu

280
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,246
Ah, okay Um

281
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,340
Yeah, I'll have
the Porterhouse, medium,

282
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,679
with a loaded baked potato

283
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:21,753
Great

284
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,821
You eat meat?

285
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,050
How can you do that
to those poor, furry little animals?

286
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,127
I ordered a steak, it's
cows aren't furry or little

287
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,855
You better watch yourself

288
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,590
What goes around
comes around

289
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,563
You may be reincarnated as a cow

290
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,135
With some big oaf
sticking a fork into you

291
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,396
And for the lady?

292
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,739
Oh, I'll have the tuna fillet
and your house salad

293
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,340
Oh, with the dressing on the side

294
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,976
Back with your drinks

295
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,111
Uh, I don't get it

296
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,743
You don't eat meat
but you ordered a tuna steak

297
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,986
I didn't order a tuna steak,
I ordered a tuna fillet

298
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,819
Okay, but, my point

299
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,451
Michelle:
And tuna's not meat

300
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,291
I have a very clear rule

301
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,695
I never eat anything with faces

302
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,598
And fish don't have faces
Only profiles

303
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,398
Thank you

304
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,342
Ugh

305
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,643
So, what's the story
with that car of yours?

306
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,873
What's wrong with my car?

307
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,281
It's a relic!

308
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,114
It's a classic

309
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,383
A Porsche is a classic
Yours is a fossil

310
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,516
When we were driving here I felt like
I was driving to church with my grandpa

311
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,254
Okay, that's enough
All right?

312
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,422
I can't take any more
of your constant complaining

313
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,362
I don't have to take this from an "N"

314
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,437
I could throw a bun
and hit another "N"

315
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,166
Maybe if you were an "X" or a "U"

316
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,710
But an "N"?
You've got to be kidding me

317
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,872
Take a cab home,
if you can find one you like

318
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,919
And I'm taking this

319
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,462
Wendy, hey! What a surprise

320
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,662
What are you doing here?

321
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,865
Well, um

322
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,738
I just haven't
heard from you in a while

323
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,210
I called a couple times
but I guess you've been pretty busy

324
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:32,909
Yeah, I've, uh I've been
a little preoccupied, you could say

325
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,918
I guess

326
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,853
Well here, I, uh
I baked you a pie

327
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,488
- A pie?
- Yeah

328
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,928
Wow, wow, that's swell

329
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:48,295
It's a peach pie, so "P" could be
for peach, or for Peterson, right?

330
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,068
"P" for Peterson
Yes, sir

331
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,865
Uh, you shouldn't have

332
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,101
I wanted to

333
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,515
Hey, you want to go maybe
grab a coffee or something?

334
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,744
Well, you know,
I'm, uh I'm pretty bagged,

335
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,617
and, uh, I've already had
a pretty rough night, so

336
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,656
Well, if it's something
you want to talk about

337
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,955
Not really No, thanks though

338
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,585
Okay, um

339
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,960
Well good night?

340
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,225
Yeah, yeah, good night

341
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,928
I mean, pie Wow
Peach pie

342
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,740
I'll give you call later,
see how you liked the

343
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,571
Pie

344
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,579
Did you know you have no face?

345
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,625
That's right,
you only have profiles

346
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,856
Not only that, I got a psycho Betty Crocker
hanging outside my room

347
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,369
Well I'm telling you buddy, for a lunatic,
she makes a kick-ass pie

348
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,529
I just hope
she didn't poison it

349
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,014
Where's Benny?

350
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,712
Oh, I think
he's at the pub with the guys

351
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,148
Fuck it, it's early,
I still may be able to grab a stat

352
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,317
You coming?

353
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,355
Cleaver: Yeah, I don't mind
getting my horn scraped tonight

354
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,262
Miles:
Roadie?

355
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,957
Cleaver:
Don't mind if I do

356
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,290
Cleaver:
Your camera

357
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,369
Oh, thanks

358
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,571
Oh shit, the "P's" back!

359
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,639
Fuck! No

360
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,774
You should've seen
the look on your face

361
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,107
This is my shit

362
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,308
I am so getting some pussy!

363
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,045
All I ask is that
you don't get anything on that shirt

364
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,987
I'm not going to get
anything on your shirt

365
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,141
Miles:
Where's the crew?

366
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,848
Lot of nice talent here tonight, ah?

367
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,890
Not too shabby

368
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,397
Next pitcher's on me

369
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,568
How you doin'
Ben Chia-dick

370
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,479
Hi, I'm Miles

371
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,707
Hi, Rebecca

372
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,113
Nice to meet you, Rebecca

373
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,184
Nice to meet you

374
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,885
You got a last name, Rebecca?

375
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,320
Stenson

376
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,390
Sorry?

377
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,550
- Stenson
- Barmaid: $1250

378
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,696
That's a shame

379
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,811
Oh Hey, Miles, how about that girl
over there with the big breasts?

380
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,111
Whoa, check out
the crazy funbags on that chick!

381
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,312
That's nice

382
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,446
Those are so mine

383
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,490
Those are so fuckin' yours

384
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,150
No, I was pointing her out
for Miles!

385
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,024
No, I was pointing her out
for Miles Grow up, fuck

386
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,360
Dude, dude, dude,
check it out

387
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,390
That's the girl that fixed my car

388
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,297
No, you don't want her, Miles,

389
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,340
you know what they say:
"Good from far is far from good", right?

390
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,540
I've seen her up close, Benny

391
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,339
She's good
She's real good

392
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,479
So, what you doin' here, hero?

393
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,077
You finished three pumpin'
the "N" yet?

394
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,589
You guys done strugglin'
on the dance floor yet?

395
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,257
It's the fuckin' "P"

396
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,797
Great

397
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,735
Cleaver:
So what are you going to do?

398
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,069
Miles: It's the "P", man,
I can't get rid of the fuckin' "P"

399
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,201
Probably should get
your prostate checked

400
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,838
Thanks, I'll look into that,
Doogie Jackass

401
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:36,049
God, I mean,
first the "N's" a bust,

402
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:39,021
then I've got this psycho
baking me a pie?

403
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,718
Miles: And those strugglers
are bustin' my balls

404
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,056
Busting my balls

405
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,959
Take a pill man,
relax, all right?

406
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,965
Whatever, but I can't face that P-sycho
twice in one night

407
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,694
Okay, well,
you're going to have to go solo,

408
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,396
because I'm staying right here
and hitting on that girl with the great big boobs

409
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,107
All right Well, come by the bomb shelter
after you strike out

410
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,244
That's not funny!

411
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,481
Jerk

412
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,545
How you doin'?

413
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,425
Huh? Huh?

414
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:26,895
Hey, Ben!

415
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,406
Ben!

416
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,564
Ben!

417
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,542
Why don't you take your fucking balls
out of your purse and go talk to her?

418
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,083
So what do you
call the other one?

419
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,883
Huh?

420
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,161
This doesn't have
your phone number on it

421
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,896
Hi, remember me?

422
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,869
Gabrielle:
It's Ben, right? From Ethics?

423
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:01,996
Yeah!

424
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,234
Gabrielle:
Do you want to sit down?

425
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,071
Sure, if you don't mind

426
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,875
I'm going to walk around for a bit

427
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,449
Bye

428
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,812
It was nice meeting you

429
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,352
So, how about that test
we got on Friday?

430
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,055
I know, I'm going to be at the library
for a week for that one

431
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,373
Hey, Cleaver

432
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,771
Hey, Benji

433
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,202
Why are you looking like the cat
that just got his dick sucked?

434
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,038
Did you fucking talk to that girl?

435
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,483
Yeah, I talked to her

436
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,381
- Fuck outta here Really?
- Seriously

437
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:48,942
Fuck Nice!

438
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,715
You talk, uh, to big guns yet?

439
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,414
Uhh Check it out

440
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,393
I take it you're in

441
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,893
I'm so fuckin' in

442
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,655
Ben:
Sergeant Rock-Dick?

443
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,228
Cleaver, what's this?

444
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:09,035
Oh, that is thunder in a pill,
my flaccid friend

445
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,507
You see, Benji, you only get one chance
to make a first impression,

446
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,774
and I am going to make mine
a lasting one

447
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,741
Shit, Cleaver, is that safe?

448
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,279
Not for her

449
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,384
Cleaver:
So you live here alone, or?

450
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,320
Woman:
No

451
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,516
Cleaver:
So you got a roommate?

452
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,821
Woman:
Yeah, I got a roommate

453
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:30,895
Cleaver:
Guy or girl?

454
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,428
- It's a girl
- Yeah?

455
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,999
You know, you really
didn't have to walk me back

456
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,294
Hey, no, no that's okay,

457
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,301
'cause, you know, there's a lot of
dicks around here So

458
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,598
Yeah, there is a lot
of dicks around here

459
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,935
- Yeah
- Well anyway, this is it, so

460
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,941
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah, I'll see you around, okay?

461
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,672
Vikki, um

462
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,776
Can I can I come in
for a drink or something?

463
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,678
It's really late
I have to get up early tomorrow Yeah

464
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,517
Oh, uh, okay

465
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,490
No, I really don't want to be so blunt

466
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,026
- But uh
- Hmm?

467
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,824
You're about to waste a perfectly good
diamond cutter here, babe

468
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,762
That is disgusting

469
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,959
It's not disgusting,
It's physics

470
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,233
Fuck! Fuck!

471
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,465
Can I call you tomorrow?

472
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,442
Vik?

473
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,251
Hey!

474
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,217
- Cleaver: Hey!
- Having a good time tonight?

475
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,619
Things are looking up

476
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,953
I like your shirt

477
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,457
Well, it likes you

478
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,051
Really?

479
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,355
Really

480
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,490
Looks like somebody's
had enough to drink, huh?

481
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,466
Never enough

482
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,503
I've got lots to drink at my place

483
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,936
Really?

484
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,267
You coming?

485
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,866
Oh, fuck yeah, I'm coming

486
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,850
Those are interesting pants

487
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,581
Can you show me
how they come off?

488
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,407
Cleaver: You know, I gotta say,
I love what you did with the place

489
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,306
Girl: Oh yeah? Oh!

490
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,969
- Oh shit
- Oh!

491
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,740
I spilled on you know what?
I think we're going to have to get this shirt off

492
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,081
Yeah? Oh!

493
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,620
Ohh, I spilled on you

494
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,815
I think that's
going to have to come off

495
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,585
- Really?
- Yeah

496
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,017
Yes!

497
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,569
Oh my God, Miles

498
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,240
Stacy Usher

499
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,143
Stacy:
Oh, Miles

500
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,708
Oh, "U"

501
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,083
Stacy:
Oh yes Oh!

502
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,247
Stacy Usher

503
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,256
Miles:
Who's Stacy Swanson?

504
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,390
Stacy:
I am Oh!

505
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,024
Miles:
I thought you said your name was Usher

506
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,369
Stacy:
It is

507
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,837
Okay, hang on, you're confusing me

508
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:34,639
I'm kind of drunk, I don't have a whole lot of blood
going to my brain right now

509
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,917
My mom got re-married
so I go by both

510
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,646
What's the name
on your birth certificate?

511
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,246
Stacy:
Don't stop

512
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,483
Stacy, what does the name
on your birth certificate say?

513
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,655
Swanson, why?

514
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,859
What's wrong?

515
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,163
Nothing Another "S"

516
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,436
Cleaver: Oh yeah, who's your Daddy,
oh, oh, oh!

517
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,607
That's right That's right!
Who's your Daddy?

518
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:16,119
Oh, oh!
Git along, little doggie, whoo!

519
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,883
What's the matter, what's the matter?

520
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,026
You okay?

521
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,720
What's wrong?

522
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,393
You don't look so good
What's wrong?

523
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,723
Cleaver:
Fuck! Oh!

524
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,061
Oh fuck!

525
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,306
All right, all right uh

526
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,070
Let's just finish this up doggie-style

527
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,980
No babe

528
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,051
Wait, I gotta get behind you

529
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,418
Cleaver:
Ben Benji

530
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,852
I had sex with a girl last night

531
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:01,921
And she puked, all over me

532
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,194
Good morning, sunshine

533
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,066
Ben:
What the fuck Cleaver?

534
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,265
And it went
a little something like this

535
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,341
Ben:
Fuck off!

536
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,548
Asshole

537
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,313
Cleaver: How about you, stallion?
Any letters last night?

538
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,384
Miles:
I was railin' a "U"

539
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,458
Nice!

540
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,351
She turned into an "S"

541
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,022
Damn those "S"s

542
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,325
Miles:
I know

543
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,797
Cleaver:
Fuck!

544
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,097
Hey, man, what the fuck?

545
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,034
Dude, these are
sacred documents, all right?

546
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,133
Not to be desecrated
by the likes of you

547
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,272
Okay, relax

548
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,142
Don't be worrying about
your precious little diaries here

549
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,120
What you should be worrying about
are these last three letters

550
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:02,489
Okay, tell me Miles,
where are you going to find an "X", huh?

551
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,897
You know, my entire life,
I haven't even met an "X"

552
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,640
How about you, afro-sac?
You know any "X"s?

553
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,401
Uh, no
No, I don't know any "X"s

554
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,575
Then go back to sleep

555
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,551
You know, this whole buckshot approach
has gotten us pretty far

556
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,988
But we don't have a snowball's chance
of finding an "X" and a "U" this way

557
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,254
What do you suggest?

558
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,232
Leave the "X" and the "U" to me

559
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,930
All right, well you set up the pins,
and I'll knock 'em down

560
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,167
Another puker, huh?

561
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,437
Yeah

562
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,442
You weren't wearing my

563
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,813
Your shirt? Yeah
You don't want that back

564
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,113
No

565
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,454
Dr Henson never takes
his questions from that book

566
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,119
- Hey, Ben
- Hey

567
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,720
- How are you?
- Good

568
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,266
- I thought you might be here
- Oh yeah?

569
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:54,327
Yeah This test Friday,
it's going to be a bugger, isn't it?

570
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,599
- I know
- Yeah

571
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,369
I like to come to
this part of the library for absolute quiet

572
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,443
Me too

573
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,712
Oh, I meant what I said, though

574
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,282
Henson never takes his questions
from that book

575
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,549
- Really?
- Yeah

576
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,045
Thanks, Ben

577
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,918
Will you share your notes with me?

578
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,953
I'd love you, I'd love to

579
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,324
Cleaver:
Ah! The bible

580
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,402
Miles: You five-fingered bastard
That's the directory

581
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,532
I know, but when there's $10,000
on the line, I can get pretty crafty

582
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,609
Gentlemen

583
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,904
Hey, Benny

584
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,172
Anyways, I already
looked through it, okay,

585
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,713
and there's only three "X"s
on the entire campus

586
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,782
Ouch

587
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:44,014
I know, there's two Xu's,
and one Xeropopple, whatever,

588
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,350
it's a Greek name, I think

589
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,184
Are you guys still doing
that stupid alphabet game?

590
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,850
No, Benny,
this is another one

591
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,859
How would you feel if someone
did this to one of your mothers?

592
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,427
I'd like to do it to his mother

593
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,124
Fucker!

594
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:04,040
Anyways, those Xu's
they have like, fucked up first names,

595
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,201
so I'm not even sure
if either of them is female

596
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,341
Actually, their names kind of sound similar
to those Chinese pandas

597
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,843
But I'm guessing they're not related

598
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,211
Probably not

599
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,444
Anyways the Greek,
I'm pretty sure that she's female

600
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,851
I mean, Gabrielle,
that's a chick's name, right?

601
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,824
Miles:
What faculty is the Greek in?

602
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,550
Uh, she's in vets

603
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,629
Okay, I looked into her Okay?

604
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,563
Her class isn't till Monday,
she lives off Campus,

605
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,829
so I'm thinking in the meantime,
we look for the "U"s

606
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,426
and the "N"s on campus

607
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,172
Miles: Why don't we just focus on the "U"s, man,
we can find "N" anywhere

608
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,880
What?

609
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,413
Hello, how are you doing today?

610
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:45,482
I'm fine

611
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,483
Is your name, Miss Unger?

612
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,382
I'm so busy right now,
I mean

613
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,250
It'll just take a second, I just have
a couple questions to ask you

614
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,916
I'm so sorry, I'm studying
and I'm really in a focus mode

615
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,015
Are you single?

616
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:57,852
Yes?

617
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,392
Miles: Is focus mode like,
code for bitch?

618
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,466
Cleaver:
Are you single?

619
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,066
- No
- No, you're not, okay

620
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,465
No, you're not But do you believe
in premarital s

621
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,506
Robin is that with a "Y"
or with an "I", Miss Upshaw?

622
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,238
Oh no, I'm not Robin Upshaw,
that's my roommate

623
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,273
That's great
Thank you for your time

624
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,348
Can I help you
with something else?

625
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,916
Uh, what's your name?

626
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:22,986
Stephanie

627
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,714
- Stephanie
- Newman

628
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,257
Stephanie Newman
with an "N"

629
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,326
Yeah

630
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,429
Hi

631
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,958
Hi, are you Angela Uverik?

632
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,461
Yeah that's correct

633
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,265
- Um
- What's that?

634
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,101
Actually, I'm just doing a survey

635
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,732
Guys, I'm not really dressed for it,

636
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:46,901
why don't you come in?

637
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,775
I got I got this one
You're looking kind of tired

638
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,178

Hi Nice to meet you Angela

641
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,088
Miles:

00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,718
Bring on the "X"

643
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,359
Giddy up

Nice

645
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,800
Miles:
Now how do we find her?

646
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:19,841
Hey, buddy, do you know
a Gabrielle Xeropoppa-

647
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,775
Xeropopolous
- Yeah

648
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,473
Sure, she's still in the lecture hall
Can't miss her

649
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,311
Thanks Top gun

650
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,156
Oh dude, I'm not liking
my odds at all

651
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,155
Oh, there's only one way
to find out

652
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,100
Cleaver:
Gabrielle!

653
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,060
Miles:
Holy crap

654
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,432
Cleaver:
What?

655
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,006
Dude, that's her

656
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,735
That's the girl that fixed my car,
the one from the pub

657
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,073
- Oh, the one that Ben's sweet on
- What?

658
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,046
You really dodged
the bullet there, I mean, she's nice

659
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,140
She's a damn sight better than nice

660
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,687
Shit, I'd do her if she was another "S"
Okay, here she comes

661
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,520
Did you just call me?

662
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,527
No

663
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:15,361
Yes You don't remember me
You fixed my car

664
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,297
Uh, the red T-bird

665
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,801
Oh, right, did you replace the battery yet?

666
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,202
Not yet, but she's running great,

667
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:26,106
and I wanted to track you down
and thank you and take you out to dinner

668
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,508
You don't have to do that,
it was no big deal

669
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,444
I'm Miles, by the way

670
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,776
Gabrielle

671
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,248
And I'm Cleaver,
just in case you were wondering

672
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,183
- Hi -
Gabrielle, that's nice

673
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,414
Thanks, my friends call me Gabby

674
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,285
All right, Gabby

675
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,722
I said, my friends call me Gabby

676
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,090
Cleaver:

677
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,856
- Hey

678
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,830
- Fran this is

679
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,334
Gabrielle:

680
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,495
This is my roommate,

681
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,572
- Hi
- Hi

682
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,275
Miles:
So what do you say?

683
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,469
You don't have to take me to dinner,
it was no big deal

684
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,546
Are you are you kidding me?
I mean

685
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,137
You're turning down a free dinner?

686
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,613
Nothing's free

687
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,480
We could make it a foursome Huh?

688
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,522
I have to study for a test I have tomorrow,
and then I have to go to work

689
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,489
Miles:
Great, I'll come by your work

690
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:20,360
I work at Taylor's Automotive,
it's not exactly conducive to visitors

691
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,798
Okay, tomorrow night

692
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,231
Fran:
Someone's a tad eager

693
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,863
Gabrielle: Actually, Fran and I
planned a movie night with the girls,

694
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,271
so maybe
we'll just play it by ear Okay?

695
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:32,970
Okay

696
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,738
- See ya
- Okay

697
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:35,903
Gabrielle:
See ya

698
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,343
I think she's gay

699
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,511
Yep, I mean what else could it be?

700
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,747
Do you think
she's doing her roommate?

701
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,315
I would pay cash money
to see some of that live lesbo action

702
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,055
See, now, that'd make sense

703
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,495
I mean, movie night
with the girls? Pfft!

704
00:38:55,166 --> 00:39:02,004
Tell me that's not code
for wild lesbian pillow fight night with the girls

705
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,300
And how about the clincher,
she's a mechanic, for Chrissake? God

706
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,871
Well this is ass!

707
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,150
And here I thought this girl
was going to give you all three inputs,

708
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,412
I mean, she's Greek
They're into that, you know?

709
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,057
This is ass
I mean she's beautiful,

710
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,955
she's playing hard to get,
and she's an "X"?

711
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,695
It's dripping with irony
when you think of it

712
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:32,901
Yeah Well, if anybody can get her,
it's you, Kemo Sabe

713
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:39,235
Yeah you're right
No more Mr fucking Nice guy

714
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,573
It's time to bring out the big guns

715
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,941
- Big guns
- Big guns!

716
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,139

00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,943
Big guns!

718
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,615
You guys are so fuckin' pathetic

719
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,684
How long's he been here?

720
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,126
I don't know

721
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,493
- Big guns
- Oh yeah

722
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,802
Oh!

723
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,692
Gabrielle, hey! How's it going?

724
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,625
- Hi, Miles
- Hi

725
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:40,497
So uh, you still doing that uh, girl
that girl night, thing, tonight?

726
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,333
Yeah, that's still the plan

727
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,269
I think we should
go out tomorrow night

728
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,344
I'm working tomorrow

729
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,680
At the mechanic shop?

730
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,744
- Yeah
- Right

731
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,943
You should really
have some sunscreen on

732
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,919
You don't want to get skin cancer
See ya!

733
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,553
See ya

734
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,456
Yup She's definitely
a rug muncher

735
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,433
Trainer: All right, Ben, what we're
going to do over here

736
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,503
is try to get you on
a muscle building program

737
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,937
You know, get your body used to the idea
of coming to a gym, working out, lifting weights

738
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,668
Actually, have you ever
been to the gym before?

739
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,245
Oh yeah,
I just took a couple months off

740
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,678
All right, well, this shouldn't be
any problem for you then, tough guy

741
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,394
Miles, what are you doing here?

742
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,590
Are you trying to get me fired?

743
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,694
Well, Gabby, If you're not
going to let me take you to dinner,

744
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,064
I'm taking dinner to you

745
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,768
I can't believe this is happening

746
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,512
I'm sorry,
am I embarrassing you?

747
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,416
Miles, my boss
is going to be back any second

748
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,077
Then let me take you to dinner

749
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,020
Okay, pack this up
and I'll let you take me for dinner

750
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,522
When?

751
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,093
- I don't know
- Oh! I hope you like cheese!

752
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,690
Okay, how about Saturday?

753
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,195
- Saturday's good
- Okay

754
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,103
Here, let me write down my number

755
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:25,999
I finish work at 6:00 on Saturday
and you can pick me up at 8:00

756
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,645

757
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,211
8:00 it is

758
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,197

Oh, I'm in with the "X"

761
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,412
What the fuck does that mean?

762
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,880
Well, Bennyit means
I'm in with the "X"

763
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,508
Let me see

764
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,417
So she doesn't eat
from the bushy plate after all?

765
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,547
Miles: Hey, apparently not,
we're hooking up Saturday

766
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:18,151
Nice How could she
resist your charms?

767
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,492
Yeah, there but for
the grace of Miles goes God

768
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,624
Hey, I like that
I'm going to use that, Ben

769
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,099
Miles:
What's up?

770
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,169
No Just

771
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:32,440
Just when you nab the "X",
I mean, it's over

772
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,208
Oh, come on,

773
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,606
Sweet victory

774
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:43,949
I can't wait to see Sylvie
and Big Eddie's faces right after I rail the "X"

775
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,649
Aren't you ever worried about catching
a fucking disease or something?

776
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:51,057
No, Benny
Never shower without a raincoat

777
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,358
Oh, you know what?
I'm just about out

778
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,361
Cleaver:
I got some domer-domers you can use

779
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,901
Thanks, but I'd rather use ones
that weren't bought in grade nine

780
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,528
Cleaver:
Uh, they're new, jackass

781
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,732
I wear a minimum of three

782
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:07,470
I mean, it cuts off the sensation
and makes my dick look bigger

783
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,603
Uggh!

784
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,541
Hello

785
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,815
Uh, sorry, Miles isn't here right now

786
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:22,051
Oh, this is his roommate, Benji
He's so busy

787
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,960
- Wendy? I'll tell him you called
- Fuck off, Cleaver

788
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,691
- Okay, bye-bye,
- Cleaver: Hey, Ben, come back to bed!

789
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,766
Ben:
Fuck off!

790
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,301
The friggin' "P"
She's like a curse!

791
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,998
Cleaver:
Okay, brother, brother, okay

792
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,166
Let's not worry about her, okay?

793
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,143
We gotta keep the positive energy flowing

794
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,341
Miles:
Soon, my pretty

795
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,918
Ohh, yes

796
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,316
- Miles?
- Yeah?

797
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,746
There's a lot of money
at stake here

798
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,381
I know

799
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,859
Okay, what I mean is that, okay,
if we don't win this contest,

800
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:03,729
and by we, I mean, you,
I can't cover the bets alone

801
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,625
How much money
are we talking about?

802
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,704
Oh, I don't, I don't know, um

803
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:11,297
something in the neighborhood
of $30,000

804
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:17,938
What? $30,000 as in,
three, and four zeros? That $30,000?

805
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,538
That's it

806
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,444
How?

807
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,747
Well, the odds on the "X"
are through the fuckin' roof,

808
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,118
I mean every guy in rez
has taken action on it

809
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,659
I mean, when she rejected you the first time,
I mean, they more than doubled

810
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,218
And the fact that she's so stinkin' hot
made them double again and again

811
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,433
Then fuck 'em, fuck 'em all

812
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,468
It'll make my victory
that much sweeter

813
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,797
Cleaver:
I love you

814
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,136
Yeah, I love me, too

815
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,344
There by the grace of Miles
goes God

816
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,440
Yeah, I like that

817
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,141
Gabrielle:
Come in!

818
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,146
Hello, it's Miles

819

820
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,810
Gabrielle:

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,388

822
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,854

00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,576
Can I help you?

825
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,345
No, um, hi

00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:05,250

827
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:08,916

828
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,960
Uh-huh

829
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,556
Miles: Fran, I swear to God,
I didn't I didn't even know she was there

830
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,326
Oh, of course you didn't

831
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,405
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- Hey, no biggie!

832
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,135
- All right!
- You guys have met, right?

833
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,734
Yeah, and I'm learning
so much more by the second

834
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,713
- Okay! We better go

835
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,875
Good night
Don't be late, I'll wait up

836
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,646
Gabrielle:
Okay

837
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,782

00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,675
Uh, yeah, do you like red wine?

857
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,150
I love it

858

860
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,222
Miles: Am I keeping you up?
I'm keeping you up, aren't I?

861
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,629
Excuse me, no, sorry
It's work Honest

862
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,426
That must be tough, you know,
going to school and working at the same time

863
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,065
It is, but I don't
have much of a choice

864
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,731
How about you?

865
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,308
Miles:
Work? Not really

866
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,639
I mean, I lifeguard in the summer

867
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,179
But I don't work
during the school year

868
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,449
Gabrielle: And saving lives
at the beach pays all your bills?

869
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:51,079
No, it doesn't,
I'm on a scholarship

870
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,786
Gabrielle:

871
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,517
Academic

872
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:59,220
Wow Didn't realize
I was on a date with a brainiac

873
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,559
Yeah I'm full of surprises

874
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,068
Yeah? I don't know
if that's a good thing or a bad thing

875
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,033
You can decide later

876
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,604
Waiter:
Ready to order?

877
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,970

00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,703
Sounds like you boys
need a lesson in manners from

889
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,509
The Menstrual Avenger!

890
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,446
Male cartoon character: Manners? I'll eat you
and your manners for breakfast!

891
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,489
What's up?

892
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,852
Guys:
Ah!

893
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,197
We'll see, we'll see

894
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,003
I guess it does
look a little bigger

895
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,037
Benny

896
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:38,386
So, how'd it go?

897
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,828
First base, second base, third?

898
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,765
Oh come on, Miles, on a scale
of one to ten, how'd it go?

899
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,638
It was the best ever

900
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,536
What? You fucked her? Nice!

901
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,406
So you were just bullshitting
with the guys out there?

902
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:59,004
That was a nice touch
Okay, uh, you got the picture?

903
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,317
I didn't even touch her
I didn't even kiss her

904
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,316
She gave me
a peck on the cheek, though

905
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,615
What? Oh, that's fuckin' gay

906
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,887
Did you at least remember
to tip her chaperone?

907
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:14,928
I can't remember having
a more fantastic time

908
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:19,263
Well gee son, I'm so glad you and your
little lady friend had such a peachy time

909
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,096
Oh, we're going out again

910
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:24,271
Yeah? So you'll fuck her next time

911
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:28,006
You can't hoink every broad
on the first night, that's what I always say, huh?

912
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,978
Sure, whatever, I don't feel
like talking about this

913
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,313
Sure, whatever Why not?

914
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,785
No, I don't think
she's the right girl for the contest

915
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,591
You don't think
she's the right girl for the contest?

916
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,126
Fine You know
Don't fuck her then

917
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,027
Go fuck one of those
Chinese pandas

918
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,997
Frankly I don't give a rat's ass
who you fuck anymore

919
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,069
as long as their last name
starts with an "X"

920
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,037
Miles, fuck we need it soon,
I can't take the stress no more,

921
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,267
I'm up to two packs of Rolaids a day,
I think I'm getting an ulcer

922
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,537
- Cleaver
- What?

923
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,306
I'll get an "X"

924
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,006
Which "X"?

925
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,549
I don't know, but I'll find an "X"

926
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,114
Okay

927
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,313
- Okay?
- Okay

928
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,447
All right? But it's late

929
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,357
- Okay
- And I'm tired

930
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,925
- Okay
- Okay?

931
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,156
- Okay
- Okay

932
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,665
Okay, I'll see you at breakfast

933
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,430
Okay

934
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,567
So you didn't even feel her up

935
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:31,641
- Okay
- Okay

936
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,609
Hey, Ben

937
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,445
Hi, you

938
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,087
You smell good

939
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:50,319
Really? I showered
after my workout

940
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,556
You look totally different

941
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,791
Did you get all new clothes
over the weekend?

942
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,728
What, these old rags?

943
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,700
Nah, I've had this 'drobe forever

944
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:10,644
Ben? Sorry Here

945
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,489
Miles

946
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,857
Hello, Fran

947
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,430
She's not ready yet

948
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,728
Okay, I'll, uh just wait out here

949
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,303
Come on in

950
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,134
Maybe if you time it right you can walk in on her
when she's about to pee

951
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,333
You're never going to let me
live that down, are you?

952
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,932
You're lucky she likes you

953
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,043
Fran:
These are my friends, Abby and Stacy

954
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,378
- Miles: Hi
- Hi

955
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,452
Hi!

956
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,857
Hey

957
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,089
Hello

958
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,391
- Are you okay, Miles?
- Miles: Yeah!

959
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,332
Fine, it's a nice day

960
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,401
Fran:
You look pale

961
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:08,596
No Pale? No I'm good

962
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:10,437
I'm good

963
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,975
Gabrielle:
Sorry I'm late

964
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,671
Miles: Hey, no biggie
Don't worry about it

965
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,805
- We should go, though We should
- Okay

966
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,314
- Yeah

967
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:24,012
- Yeah Hi, yeah
- Oh! Okay

968
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,654
See you guys later

969
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,034

984
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:46,502
Miles:
No

985
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,132
- No, Gabrielle, that's amazing
- Thanks

986
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,969
You can call me Gabby now

987
00:56:56,646 --> 00:57:00,776
Hey, Benny I might be
bringing Gabby back here tonight,

988
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,318
her roommate's a bit of a ball buster,

989
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:08,414
so perhaps you could make yourself scarce
and not be here?

990
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,823
That would be nice

991
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,024
And where the hell
am I supposed to go?

992
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:16,265
Did you ever think
that for just one second

993
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,095
I might be bringing
a girl back here?

994
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,303
No Okay, listen

995
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:28,674
Here, there's $10, $20

996
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,406
Go see a movie

997
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,072
Go see a couple of movies

998
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,674
Huh? A couple of movies I gotta run

999
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:54,463
Hello No, Wendy, he isn't here

1000
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,463
I don't know, he's, uh

1001
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:05,947
He's gone right now
but he'll be back later

1002
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:10,985
And uh, I won't be here,
I'm going to be gone all night

1003
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:17,152
Yeah, okay Bye

1004
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,071
Picnic basket right

1005
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,139
Miles:
Holy crap

1006
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,472
Gabrielle:
I should go

1007
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:36,511
Miles: Please don't leave
I have no idea what's going on here

1008
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:41,040
No You need to sort this out
And I gotta go

1009
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,820
Wendy, what are you doing here?

1010
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,019
Are you here for Ben?

1011
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:54,092
Do you know that I was actually
stupid enough to think that you might have liked me?

1012
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,297
Yeah, listen, Wendy

1013
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:57,957
Wendy:
Don't "Listen, Wendy" me

1014
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,029
You're happy
you got your fuck, right?

1015
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,905
Wendy, it's not like that

1016
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,305
Wendy:
It's exactly like that, asshole

1017
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,742
You had your fun and you don't care
who gets hurt

1018
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,608
God, I can't believe I was so stupid

1019
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:19,447
I can't believe I liked you
I can't believe I baked you a pie

1020
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:23,882
Man:
You're going the wrong way, honey!

1021
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,187
What just happened?

1022
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,525
Some of your stats
coming back to haunt you there, Miles?

1023
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:29,626
Not now, Ben

1024
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,200
Yep, you love women, don't you?

1025
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:35,098
You love the way they look
You love the way they fuck

1026
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:38,970
But as soon as you blow your load, that's it
The love affair's over, isn't it?

1027
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,270
Okay, who blew their load?

1028
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:46,239
Miles You got the "X"

1029
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:52,147
Cleaver:
Miles and Xeropopolous sittin' in a tree

1030
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:57,716
F- U-C-K-I-N "X"!

1031
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:00,853
"X"!

1032
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,023
Cleaver: Don't leave me hangin' brother,
give me the picture!

1033
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,606
Okay, uh, well I looked into
those Chinese pandas

1034
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,734
and I got some bad news

1035
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,903
One of them turns out
to be a fuckin' guy,

1036
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,106
and the other one's been,
like, deported or something

1037
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,580
'cause no one can seem to find her

1038
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,913
- Cleaver
- Cleaver: Okay, Miles

1039
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:26,045
We're "T" minus two weeks
but we're still in pretty good shape

1040
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,555
But, brother, honestly I think
you should have railed the "X" by now

1041
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:29,647
Miles:
Gabrielle?

1042
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:34,092
Yeah she has name,
it's Gabrielle It's not "X"

1043
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,425
Okay Gabrielle

1044
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,324
So when are we fucking Gabrielle?

1045
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:43,201
Miles: Aw, Jesus Christ,
don't, Cleaver Listen

1046
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:47,709
It's over, it's over Take your contest
and get out, would you?

1047
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,574
What are you talking about,
It's not over

1048
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,046
No! Take it and get out

1049
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:04,083
What the
Oh, this fuckin' sucks

1050
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,793
You want you want to piss away
a legendary stat quest

1051
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:11,060
and all that
fuckin' money for some tighty

1052
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,691
that's your call

1053
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:18,601
Man, what happened to you?
You used to be cool

1054
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,781
Fuck! And take that fuckin' smirk
off your face, man

1055
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,582
Cleaver:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1056
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,419
I'm going to assume this sabotage
is all you're doing?

1057
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,924
She's going to find out
about you sooner or later

1058
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,288
Miles:
I love her, Ben

1059
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,650
Please

1060
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:40,729
Miles:
I love her

1061
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,092
Ben:
You don't even know what that is

1062
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,325
Oh, and you do Huh?

1063
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,902
Cleaver told me about
the crush you have on her, man

1064
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:52,373
It's obvious But here's a shocker,
she's not interested in you

1065
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,471
And no matter how much
of my cologne you steal,

1066
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,640
or how much you swifty up your look,
you'll always be you

1067
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,046
And you know what?
I'll always be me

1068
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,915
You're so fucking conceited

1069
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,818
Miles:
Ben, she's out of your league

1070
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:11,115
And you know what, the sooner you realize that,
the happier you'll be

1071
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:32,440
- Hey, listen, Gabby, about last night
- Don't bother, Miles

1072
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,449
No, listen, I have this whole speech planned,
just let me get through it Okay?

1073
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,681
Oh, and did that girl help you write it?

1074
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,654
Miles: Look she was just someone
that I dated once,

1075
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,056
but there was no chemistry
so we didn't date again

1076
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,925
But she just sleeps in your bed
when you're not there

1077
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,428
You don't believe me, do you?

1078
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,125
Gabrielle:
I don't know

1079
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,793
Listen, I'm not seeing anyone else

1080
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,097
I don't want to see anyone else

1081
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:58,105
I don't want you seeing anyone else

1082
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:03,440
Miles, my ex-boyfriend
was a player

1083
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:06,572
He was cheating on me the whole time
we were together and I had no idea

1084
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,775
I don't need another guy like that

1085
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,260
I'm going to regret this

1086
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,794
No you won't

1087
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:51,860
Miles:
Hello? Hello?

1088
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,957
Hello?

1089
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,423
Who was it?

1090
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,932
They hung up

1091
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,711
Ben, I think you're a really great guy

1092
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:16,751
And I like you a lot
Just not more than a friend

1093
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,250
You don't even know Miles

1094
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,983
I know enough

1095
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,422
What about Wendy?

1096
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,255
He explained Wendy

1097
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,851
And you're okay with that?

1098
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:31,730
Ben, all I care about is what goes on
with Miles and I from this point forward, okay?

1099
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,596
We'll still be friends?

1100
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,567
Okay

1101
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:15,944
Okay, listen Ben

1102
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,104
We've been buds all year, right?

1103
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,377
And I hate losing friends over girls,

1104
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,543
'cause nine times out of ten
it ain't worth it

1105
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:28,685
Generally speaking
I think you're a good guy, I do,

1106
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:32,887
and that's why I'm not too proud of the things
I said to you the other day

1107
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,520
But I think you had it coming
for that stunt you pulled

1108
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:41,466
Okay, that's about as mushy as I'm going to get
so you can take it or leave it

1109
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,197
All right, now don't get
all fruity on me

1110
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:48,468
Where you headed?

1111
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:51,340
Dumpster, then laundry
You need anything thrown out?

1112
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,972
- No
- No? Okay I'll see you at dinner

1113
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:58,111
Miles:
Oh, and Ben?

1114
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,415
I really do love her

1115
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:04,655
Man: Miles, you fucking cock
Where's my fucking money?

1116
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,954
Miles:
Fuck you

1117
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:53,106
Ben: I'm sorry, but,
I thought you had to know

1118
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:08,222
It's a game He's trying to fuck
the entire alphabet and you're the "X"

1119
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,623
Gabrielle:
I can't believe this

1120
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:19,294
Miles: Silvio, I think
something died in your room

1121
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,063
- Silvio: Huh?
- Miles: Yeah It's not right

1122
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,832
It's so not natural
Your room, my eyes, they're bleeding

1123
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:25,065
Silvio:
Nice underwear, faggot

1124
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:26,471
Hey, Gabby, wh

1125
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,509
You little fucker

1126
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,415
Don't blame him, you evil prick

1127
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,178
- Now listen, Gabby it's not
- You want to fuck an "X"?

1128
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,547
Gabrielle: You go fuck a xylophone!

1129
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,814
Wait! Gabby, wait, Gabby

1130
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,315
Miles:
Look, Gabby, I can explain

1131
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,860
- It's Gabrielle to you, asshole
- Okay, fine, Gabrielle

1132
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:49,419
It's not what you think, Okay?
My feelings for you are real

1133
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,362
Those other girls,
they didn't mean a thing to me

1134
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,434
Oh, that's nice

1135
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,195
I'm sorry, but it's true!

1136
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:58,865
Look I threw out all those photos and diaries
to get rid of my past, for you

1137
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,799
Then why were they in your drawer?

1138
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,311
I don't know I mean, Ben must have
fished them out of the dumpster

1139
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:05,907
Fuckin' weasel!

1140
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:11,214
No, look, okay before I met you,
I didn't know I was such an asshole

1141
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,618
Okay? But I've never met
a girl like you

1142
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:17,123
You're different
than any girl I've ever met

1143
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,557
You've made me want to change

1144
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,095
Okay, no, Gabby
God, Gabby, please

1145
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,665
I am begging you,
give me another chance

1146
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:27,033
I'm not the same guy
that did all that stuff

1147
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:33,303
When I hear you talk like that,
it makes me want to puke

1148
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,741
You're a pig All men are pigs

1149
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,143
So do me a favour and leave me
the fuck alone

1150
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:44,444
CMFU campus radio
on the all request hour

1151
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:47,779
I'm sending this one out as a special request
to our buddy Miles

1152
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,085
who's in a real bad place right now

1153
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:56,998
<i># I can't believe that I've found
all I wanted</i>

1154
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,999
<i># In you...</i>

1155
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,928
You can say "I told you so"
whenever you want

1156
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:08,405
<i># I haven't done what I have to do</i>

1157
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,706
Miles:
Can I come in?

1158
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,440
No

1159
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:13,640
Miles:
Is she here?

1160
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,046
No

1161
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,846
Miles:
Would you tell me if she was?

1162
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,351
Fran:
No

1163
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:19,421
Miles:
Come on, let me just

1164
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,753
Look, you even try getting in here,
I'll cut your fucking dick off

1165
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,189
Okay, fair enough

1166
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:28,389
<i>#... to you</i>

1167
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:33,628

1168
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:39,641

<i># Will I say that I'm sorry</i>

1171
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:59,517
Hi, uh Gabrielle Xropoleus?

1172
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,060
Fran:
Thanks

1173
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,932
What are you doing?
The door's open

1174
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:18,071
Yeah, um, Wendy the "P"

1175
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,479
she, uh she gave me that
to give to Miles,

1176
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:24,382
but since I ain't talking to him,
you give it to him

1177
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,278
We're not exactly
on speaking terms, either

1178
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,090
Really, why not?

1179
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,229
You know Miles, he's just
going through a weird thing right now

1180
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:36,360
Yeah, no fuckin' shit

1181
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:40,428
I mean that guy's been hoinking chicks
left and right all year,

1182
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,130
and now he's pussying after some chick
he hasn't fucked yet?

1183
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:47,575
Come on
Doesn't make sense

1184
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,780
It's always sad when one
of the great ones retire, eh, Ben?

1185
01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:02,515
Let's just hug it out
It'll be okay

1186
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,222
Be strong

1187
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,862
Big Eddie:
Give me my fuckin' money, man!

1188
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,163
Cleaver:
Fuck off!

1189
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:27,841
Ben: "Dear Miles, I want you to know
I appreciate the letter you wrote me

1190
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,645
Of course I accept
your apology"?

1191
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,443
- Big Eddie: Hey
- Hey!

1192
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:34,215
- Fuck face
- Big Eddie, how's it going?

1193
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,891
What did I tell you
about fucking with my money?

1194
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,722
What are you talking about?

1195
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,525
If my bet's no good
because you opened up your pansy trap,

1196
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,601
I swear to Christ I will knock
the living piss right out of you

1197
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,102
- Big Eddie
- Don't give me that shit, bitch!

1198
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,069
Miles:
Am I interrupting something special?

1199
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,740
Word is, big mouth here
fucked up your shit with the "X" 'cause he likes her

1200
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,906
Yeah, well, Benny
didn't fuck up anything,

1201
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,916
it just didn't work out

1202
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,946
- Big Eddie:
Well, superhero

1203
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:11,081
Then it looks like your pal Cleaver
will be owing me some money

1204
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,491
Miles:
Looks like it

1205
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:20,867
Yeah

1206
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,375
You all right?

1207
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,540
Yeah Thanks

1208
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,177
Listen, Benny

1209
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,250
Between pulling your daggers
out of my back

1210
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,911
and being assaulted by girls,
I've had some time to think

1211
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:44,325
I guess I haven't exactly
treated women like gold in the past

1212
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:49,590
So I kind of understand why you did
what you did Again

1213
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,532
But remember what I said
and I meant it

1214
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,873
I'm trying to get her back

1215
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,341
Oh, give me a fucking break

1216
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,973
Honestly He's apologized
to Wendy

1217
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,211
He stopped big Eddie
from beating me up

1218
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,982
He's not even
hanging around Cleaver anymore

1219
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:17,684
It's like he's on some sort of 12-step
do-gooder program or something

1220
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,253
Hmm

1221
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:28,869
Listen Before any of this stuff happened,
he told me he loved you

1222
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:32,797
I didn't believe him then
but I do now

1223
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:37,578
He really did throw out
all those pictures and diaries

1224
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,181
I sort of, fished them out
of the dumpster

1225
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,107
Oh, Ben

1226
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,721
Wendy? Hi

1227
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,260
Hi

1228
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,964
You don't remember me I'm Ben

1229
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,556
Ben

1230
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:36,104
Uh Miles's roommate

1231
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,196
Oh

1232
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:41,367
We've talked on the phone
a couple of times I

1233
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,308
Yeah, yeah, of course

1234
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,945
It's nice to finally
talk to you face to face

1235
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,291
- I'll be right back
- Okay

1236
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:12,307
Hey, hey Gabrielle,
come on, wait a second

1237
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,602
You know if you keep hitting this button
people are going to think you're trying to leave

1238
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,838
So when do you start healing lepers?

1239
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,641
I'm working my way up

1240
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,317
What are you doing here,
what's this about?

1241
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,488
Actually, I used to spend
a lot of time here doing this

1242
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,216
when my grandfather was dying

1243
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,761
Oh by the way,
I really liked your pie

1244
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:36,626
- Really?
- Yeah, it was amazing

1245
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,132
Well, thank you

1246
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:40,792
Pie

1247
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:44,134
So, are you going home
right after exams?

1248
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,434
Um, no, I'm sticking around
for the weekend

1249
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:51,344
Do you maybe want
to catch a movie or something?

1250
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:53,546
Sure

1251
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,181
I don't know what to think anymore

1252
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,517
Look, exams start in three days,

1253
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:03,614
and I don't want to risk
never seeing you again

1254
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:09,297
Meet me tonight
Meet me tonight at our spot

1255
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,433
I must be crazy

1256
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,311
All right, so I'll call you
tomorrow night

1257
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,613
Okay

1258
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,121
You know what?
I'm not sure if it matters anymore,

1259
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,657
but I completely forgot to give Miles
your letter

1260
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:39,852
My letter?

1261
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:42,829
Yeah, the one you gave to Cleaver
to give to Miles

1262
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,594
Because he wrote you the apology

1263
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:49,694
Apology? I don't think so

1264
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,138
Hi

1265
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,372
I was afraid
you weren't going to show

1266
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:03,851
I wouldn't miss this
for the world

1267
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:27,470
Oh It is so fucking on

1268
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,314
Cleaver:
Oh yeah

1269
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,655
Ooh! Boobies!

1270
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,253
What the fuck? What?

1271
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:50,661
Fuck off!

1272
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,427
Boobies!

1273
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,162
What the fu

1274
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:27,735
Gabrielle:
Gotcha

1275
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:43,576
So Shall I call the ambulance?

1276
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,852
Why do you need an ambulance?

1277
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,488
'Cause you're going to need one
if you don't got my money

1278
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:58,830
Okay, okay I'll admit,
okay, this is looking a little grim right now

1279
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,199
But, you know, Miles could turn this
whole thing around okay?

1280
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:05,296
I mean, he could change
this whole angry mob scene

1281
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,637
into one great big beautiful orgy

1282
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:12,311
He can He will

1283
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,249
Please
