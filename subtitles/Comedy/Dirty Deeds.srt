2
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:13,155
I've tried my best,
with these subtitles

3
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:20,234
I did them by listening so they
might not be perfect (just 99.99%)

4
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:27,281
a few words I couldn't hear properly,
I hope you overlook that

5
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:30,171
<i>ENJOY!</i>

6
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,652
West Valley High.
My high school.

7
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:12,027
I bet it's a lot like yours
which means, it probably sucks.

8
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,158
But you see we got something
other schools don't:

9
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,226
The dirty deeds.

10
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,965
Once a year,
the night before homecoming,

11
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,473
anybody can
take this challenge.

12
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,942
Hardly anybody ever does,
and when they do,

13
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,206
it's usually a punk kid
with a death wish

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,305
out to prove that he is tough or cool.

15
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,249
To me it's bullshit,
just like everything else around here.

16
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,616
Welcome to homecoming weekend.

17
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,120
Until, today.

18
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,625
Come on, move!

19
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,925
That's my spot.

20
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,308
First of, I'd like to announce

21
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,248
that this years honorary chair person,

22
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,412
Rachel Buff, homecoming queen 4 years ago

23
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,786
and now a professional model,

24
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,485
will be joining us this weekend.

25
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,761
You've no doubt seen her
on the catalogue for the laundry.

26
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,198
She'll be giving out

27
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,099
the senior words tomorrow
morning at the carnival.

28
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,971
Red light.

29
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,758
God, I'll love you for ever.

30
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,319
Meg, I've finished your
college recommendation letter.

31
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,194
Oh thanks, Mrs. Hale.

32
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,326
I've told them your odds on
favorite for valedictorian.

33
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,463
Valedictorian?
What does that mean?

34
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,269
It's Latin, means a post scholarship.

35
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,105
Ticket out of this town
and a guarantee

36
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,839
I'll never have to
wait tables in my life.

37
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,473
Crap, I'm late.

38
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,350
We're not late.

39
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,287
And now, to unveil this year's
homecoming banner,

40
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,291
your senior class president:

41
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,987
the fabulous Dan Lawton.

42
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,267
Hey, how is it lookin'?

43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,215
First, I wanna say that the Vikings

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,843
are gonna kick some major ass tomorrow.

45
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,588
Did you watch where you're goin'.

46
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,859
Every time.

47
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,528
Sorry.

48
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:22,152
Moron.

49
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,627
Sorry.

50
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,121
And now...

51
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,895
let's get homecoming weekend started.

52
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,614
Who would wanna go
and do a thing like that?

53
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,249
My office, Mr. Harper, now.

54
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,354
We're gonna be late.

55
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,661
Not me. I graduated in June.

56
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,368
That'd be all, Miss Straight.

57
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,677
So Mr. Harper.

58
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,277
Yes, Mr. Fuchs.

59
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,218
Pronouncing my name correctly,
that's a start.

60
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,319
- Well I can always go back to...
- I have no doubt, Mr. Harper.

61
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,330
I still think you know something about this

62
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,298
recent outbreak of pranks.

63
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,564
Shall I call your mother try to arrange
a conference one more time?

64
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,105
Knock yourself out,
fifth time is a charm.

65
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,573
I seem not to have a
number for your father.

66
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,803
Join the party.

67
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,937
You don't have a lot of respect for
authority, do you, Mr. Harper?

68
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,310
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

69
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,652
I wanted a moment alone with you guys,

70
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,657
cause you're the leaders of this school.

71
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,217
Trust me Biggs.

72
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,264
I'm depressed about that
as you are.

73
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,855
How can we help you,
Officer Dill?

74
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,699
Well it's homecoming
weekend at West Valley,

75
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,433
and everybody knows that means
a lot of talk about the dirty deeds.

76
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,839
I haven't heard anything.

77
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,740
- How about you guys?
- Naa, naa.

78
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:00,241
Hey!

79
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,541
Well let's just keep that
that way, shall we?

80
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,143
It's been a long time since
anybody's tried it

81
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,382
and I don't want any of you,
knuckleheads,

82
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,980
getting any ideas.

83
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,583
Actually my dad said:
"Back that day, you've tried it".

84
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,289
But he pissed his pants
before he did burst one.

85
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,131
Yeah...

86
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,136
well your dad used to shower
in his bathing suit.

87
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,367
We've got everything
under control.

88
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:35,141
Good. We'll see that you do.
Come on, Bevins.

89
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,081
- It's all good, Officer Dill.
- "Douh".

90
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,418
Douchebags.

91
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,527
Now was that the work of you
and your band of misfits?

92
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:56,796
You flatter me, Mr. Fuchs,
because that is first rate stuff.

93
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,236
I've noticed the letters "I-A-B"
appear once again, Mr. Harper.

94
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,933
Tell me, what do they stand for?

95
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,942
I am...

96
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,274
bored?

97
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,212
Just a guess.

98
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,614
Sadly the school board and I differ

99
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,584
on rules regarding suspension.

100
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,486
They require inconvertible
proof of a transgression,

101
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,148
but I will say this,
Mr. Harper:

102
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,593
Any student I catch right handed,
I pity them.

103
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,826
I pity anyone who has to deal
with you, sir.

104
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,629
Anything else you'd
like to add

105
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,636
before you're dismissed,
Mr. Harper?

106
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,367
No, just keep up
the good work.

107
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,826
- Hey.
- So did he suspended you?

108
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,888
Not yet, but the man
is trying his best.

109
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,833
Listen Zach, how can I say
this without sounding harsh?

110
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,893
Stay the hell away
from my brother.

111
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,905
OK, now maybe it's me,

112
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,806
- but that still sounded harsh.
- I'm serious.

113
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,002
Yeah, way too.

114
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:13,403
- Look, some strange reason,
he really looks up to you.

115
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,642
Well we gotta stop that. I mean
I don't want anybody looking up to me.

116
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,480
I'm the one who looked down
on the people that others look up to.

117
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,713
Is everything a joke with you?

118
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,254
Is anything joke with you?

119
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,120
Hey, come on.

120
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,989
Come on.

121
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,722
What are the honor society
taking no smile oath?

122
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,357
Look, I just don't want Kyle getting
into things he can't handle.

123
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,799
I mean, next year
when I'm away at school,

124
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,030
who's gonna look out for him?
Nobody.

125
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,164
I let the kid hang out.
What's the harm?

126
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,767
Just don't drag
him down Zach, OK?

127
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:08,262
Excuse me.

128
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,303
I got a note from dentist.
I can't go to gym.

129
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,400
Excuse me.

130
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,409
OK, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

131
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,931
Now, what is it young man?

132
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,201
Holy crap, what did you
eat for dinner last night?

133
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,762
A Mexican village?

134
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,573
I'll just go to gym.

135
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,482
Morning, Meg.
You are looking so hot.

136
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,121
Is your girlfriend sick today?

137
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,631
You think Jen has
to know everything?

138
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,634
- The less they know the better, right?
- You know it.

139
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,068
You know they work better
if you drink them.

140
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,706
Damn dentist drove
trough my head.

141
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,215
Did he give you anything for the pain?

142
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,444
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I can take them.

143
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,114
I can't reach my sponsor, and I don't
want to drove my sobriety down the drain.

144
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,783
- It's been five days.
- Which beats your regular by what,

145
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,284
- five days?
- Roughly.

146
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,350
It's a prescription.

147
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,454
You're in pain, it's medicine.
Take it.

148
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,155
No, no.

149
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,232
One, one.

150
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,796
- Find me in 4 to 6 hours.
- Cool.

151
00:12:55,875 --> 00:13:00,676
Hey Cummings, like the way
you make maintenance.

152
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,714
The extra money helps.

153
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,046
The sprinklers still busted?

154
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,484
Yeah, low water pressure.
All what's coming out is hot air.

155
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,785
Fascinating. Hey listen,

156
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,553
I heard that you're fast.
4-940?

157
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,857
4-7.

158
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,090
-4-7?
- Whoa.

159
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,894
- Damn.
- Hey listen,

160
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,025
let's put all this crap behind us.

161
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,161
We could use a little bit
more speed on the team.

162
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:29,003
Wide receiver, something like that.
You interested?

163
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,872
- Maybe.
- Great, once you ran a lap

164
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,936
with a stamina.
Yeah right now.

165
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,847
- Yeah man, go.
- Are you ready?

166
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,819
- Set, go!
- Come on baby, come on.

167
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:47,525
Ok, everybody, a little contribution.

168
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,743
- Good, look at you man.
- Man oh man.

169
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,904
- You could totally make this team.
- Amazing.

170
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,143
- Yeah?
- Yeah man, most definitely.

171
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,845
Your acceleration is fast.

172
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,083
I thought you'd be happy.

173
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,185
We got your sprinklers working.

174
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,457
Sorry to piss you up, dude.

175
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,767
What's going on?

176
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,275
- Lawton. Such an asshole.
- You want me to do somethin'?

177
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,675
No. I can take
care of myself, OK?

178
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,475
Ooh, you just gonna let him keep kicking
your ass until his foot hurts?

179
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,043
Something else.

180
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,560
I heard that there's 10 of them,

181
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,324
and they get like harder as you go on.

182
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,093
I heard one year
a freshman lost his balls

183
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,896
by trying to do the deeds.

184
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,631
Freshmen loose your
ball sex all the time.

185
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,710
The senior class pres has a key
to some locker somewhere

186
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,806
and that's where the deeds are.

187
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,545
- Really?
- Totally.

188
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,521
I heard you could die doing a deeds.
How very cool is that?

189
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,855
Yo, 15 years ago,
we hit the mall.

190
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,157
Football player,
homecoming king.

191
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,163
Dude's name was Duncan Rime.

192
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,499
- Duncan Rime.
- Yeah, yeah, I've heard he did.

193
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,129
No he didn't die, you retards.
Homie did a vanishing.

194
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,902
And nobody seen his white ass since. Yo.

195
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,672
- I heard he joined the mob, son.
- Yeah, that's somethin'.

196
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,770
- Ill type.
- Yeah.

197
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,552
Who talks like that?

198
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,050
It would be so cool man.

199
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,454
I mean... think about somebody
trying the deeds,

200
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,425
would pump up this homecoming weekend

201
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,189
- and totally put up our class on the map.
- Why don't you try, Biggs?

202
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,754
Me?

203
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,995
Yeah, that's right.

204
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,867
Hey, Lawton.

205
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,103
What's the matter, Cummings?
You still thirsty?

206
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,340
Check this out, Z.

207
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,851
You think you're
the big shit around here?

208
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,581
How come you don't try the dirty deeds?

209
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,147
Cause I'm not the dumb
shit around here.

210
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,420
I say it's cause you
don't have the guts.

211
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,257
But I do. Tonight
I'm doing the deeds.

212
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,640
You're on big man.

213
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,241
I'll see you tonight.

214
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,689
- Zach. Hey.
- Hey. Listen.

215
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,168
You gotta stop Kyle.
OK, he's gonna get hurt.

216
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,865
Is this the same Kyle you said
you wanted me to stay away from?

217
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,873
Yes, but maybe he
will listen to you.

218
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,875
He really wants to do this.

219
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,411
- Anything to get smart?
- I won't do it.

220
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,939
Zach, you're the only person
I can ask for help here.

221
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,916
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, Meg.

222
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,061
Look I think that's really cool
that he's got somebody

223
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,121
to look out for him.

224
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,259
Kyle is about to get thrown
in jail, expelled.

225
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,896
Yeah, I'm doing a great job.

226
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,986
- There he is.
- Hey, Mullet, attention.

227
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,513
Nice shot.

228
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,290
Alright.

229
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,434
Hey Mullet, you alright?
You alright?

230
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,338
Yeah, yeah.

231
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,137
Somebody's gotta teach
that asshole a lesson.

232
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,424
Only the losers showing up, Laws.

233
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,426
Maybe it got boo someplace.

234
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,089
Guys, take a look.

235
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,762
This is so stupid, Kyle.
OK. You don't have to do this.

236
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,771
It's the only way to get
Lawton off my back.

237
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,865
- Kyle...
- Just stay out of it. OK, Lawton,

238
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,502
- Let's do this.
- Kyle.

239
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,810
I'm doing the deeds.

240
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,378
Sorry, the job's already filled.

241
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,253
Wrong. He's a freshman,
I'm a senior.

242
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,917
Rules say I get priority.

243
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,427
He's right. Dan if a senior
wants the challenge, he ge...

244
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,760
I know the rules.

245
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,130
You want the deeds?
Fine, they are yours.

246
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,467
I'm gonna enjoy watching
you go down.

247
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,564
I'm gonna get the deeds.
That will give you some time to chicken out.

248
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,042
Harper's going to do the deeds.

249
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,207
Zach, what are you doing?
You're making me look bad.

250
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,114
Why do you get to have a lot of fun?

251
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,119
What are you doing?

252
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,314
I thought you told me
to get Kyle out of this.

253
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,550
I didn't say you should
screw up your own life.

254
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,252
That's a nice thing to say.

255
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,888
It's just, this deeds thing is sick.

256
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,659
Not if it gets Lawton off
your brother's ass.

257
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,429
- Why does he have it in for Kyle, anyway?
- You're kidding, right?

258
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,630
You're the only girl at school that
Lawton can't have his way with.

259
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,732
Kyle is just payback.

260
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,674
Take your brother home, Meg.

261
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,144
Deeds. Deeds.

262
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,785
OK.

263
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,118
Alright Harper, you know
the drill.

264
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:05,691
You don't get the second
deed until you finish the first.

265
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,891
So it goes in like order?

266
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,868
Every time you finish one,
if that happens...

267
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,040
Yeah.

268
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,042
You come back here
to get the next envelope.

269
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,602
The rules say you gotta be done
by the start of the homecoming rally,

270
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,444
tomorrow morning 9:00,
which gives you...

271
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,711
12 hours.

272
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,014
Ok, here we go.

273
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,786
It's an easy one for starters.

274
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,385
All you have to do is drink
a beer in front of a cop.

275
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,227
Looks like Dill is right inside.

276
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,706
- Here's a cold one.
- That means he's gotta see you do it.

277
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,335
That means he's watching you drink it.

278
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,608
- That means while you're drinking...
- Yeah, I got it.

279
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,482
- What's he doing?
- The code doesn't say

280
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,421
what I have to drink it out of.

281
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,482
Just says beer.

282
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,027
He's right.

283
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,292
There you go.

284
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,763
This Bud is for you, asshole.

285
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,669
Officer Dill.

286
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,180
Harper, what the hell
is going out there?

287
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,741
You know kids.
Friday night.

288
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,310
Nothin' to do.

289
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,879
Well they better not be up to
any of that deeds crap.

290
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,892
Cause tonight me and Bevins are
ready to slide on anything?

291
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,520
Anything to drink officer?

292
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,461
Yeah, I want one of those.

293
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,314
Damn that is a good cup of coffee.

294
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,045
Well you have a good night officers.

295
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,119
I know the town is safe,
thanks to you.

296
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,422
Douchebag.

297
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,231
I hope soon it's got harder.

298
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,238
Second deed.

299
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,673
You've got to punch
the toughest kid in town.

300
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,110
Gee, I guess it's up to me to decide,
who the toughest kid is.

301
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,411
- Don't worry I am not gonna choose myself.
- That's disappointing.

302
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:42,044
I know. What about JD Riplock?

303
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,112
You know him, don't ya?
Guns for biceps.

304
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,190
Genuine cycle badass.

305
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,058
He did a stretch of ju before he put
a kids head to the blackboard.

306
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,565
Hey, you alright, Ricky?

307
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,996
Go get him, slugger.

308
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,106
Good luck, Harper.

309
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,908
Nice time with ya.

310
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,702
Riplock...
He's... a psychopath.

311
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,770
- The guy's like a.
- Bobby D.

312
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,668
Yes, sir?

313
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,506
What's the D stand for?
Sorry bout that.

314
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,047
- Stands for DeSanchez.
- No stands for Douche,

315
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,308
but we can change that.

316
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,249
All you gotta do to change that is
helping me with a little problem.

317
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,753
As you guys all know, Harper is
doing the deeds tonight, right?

318
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,289
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and there is a little tradition

319
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,348
that goes along with that.

320
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,724
All night rager at a freshman's house.

321
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,558
That's funny, that's good.

322
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,325
And Bobby Douche,

323
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,491
I heard your parents are away
for the weekend.

324
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,159
Well, they are.

325
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,932
But they said I can't have anyone over,
unless it's the studies. So...

326
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,206
Yes, he's not lying.
I've heard them say it.

327
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,407
I understand that.

328
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,999
We'll do a lot of study.

329
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,545
Calculus, geometry and anatomy.

330
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,812
- Yeah, congratulations, Bobby.
- Right.

331
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,854
Thanks.

332
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:44,005
Who's next?
Who's next?

333
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,887
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

334
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,889
No, but what choice do I got?

335
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,891
- Nice place.
- Yeah, thanks man.

336
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,727
- That can't bee good.
- Yeah, I better go do something.

337
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,757
Go do something.

338
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,927
Smile.

339
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:16,003
- Come on.
- Come on, yeah, come on.

340
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,709
Come on.

341
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,870
Get him. You get him.

342
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,506
Yeah, you go.
You go.

343
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,846
Get him up, come on.

344
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,314
- Yeah.
- Come on.

345
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,301
Are you lost, Harper?

346
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,053
Nice, cool.

347
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,686
I'm gonna find out
what his deal's like.

348
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:19,559
Hey, make sure you put that back.

349
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,572
Hey what do you...?

350
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,336
- Where's the booze man?
- Booze?

351
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,400
- Yes, freshman throwing
the party got the booze.

352
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,503
- I... don't know.
- You didn't get the memo?

353
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,107
That's OK. We can search trough
everything until we find it.

354
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,651
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

355
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,553
Booze hunt.
Come on, go fellas.

356
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,921
Yeah, two deeds for Harper.

357
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,900
Is that what you did?

358
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,493
As low as humanly possible.

359
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,765
Two, two, two...

360
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,309
You've got balls, Harper.

361
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,850
I'll give you that.

362
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,283
Gee, turns out you're gonna need him

363
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,412
to do the third deed.

364
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:16,083
- What?
- That's my favorite one yet.

365
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,060
I'd hurry if I was you.

366
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,059
Supermarket closes in 20 minutes.

367
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,264
Yo, Biggs.

368
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,809
Yo. So what's the third one,
my friend?

369
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,369
Go to the market...

370
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,507
Ok, yes, sure.

371
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,565
Hello, beautiful.

372
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:59,158
Should we go back
to my place?

373
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:09,739
You guys seen Harper?

374
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:12,145
I need to give him something.

375
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:21,653
That's what he's gotta do?

376
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,320
That's like so gross.

377
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,722
Not, really.

378
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:26,869
Everybody, need to be careful.

379
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,762
There's lots of breakable
stuff here.

380
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,837
Now there is one less.

381
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:56,620
I know, this is your first time.

382
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,225
God, I hope so.

383
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:02,926
He's gonna die.

384
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:05,623
I'm going to kill him.

385
00:30:06,624 --> 00:30:08,524
He's gonna die.

386
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:22,746
That's right,

387
00:30:22,748 --> 00:30:24,417
make a sandwich out of me.

388
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:28,683
Here let me help you.

389
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,751
<i>That a boy.</i>

390
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,520
<i>Know what I love?</i>

391
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,162
<i>Mayo between my slices.</i>

392
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,159
Come on.

393
00:30:43,364 --> 00:30:45,460
Hey, move it.

394
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,405
Come on.

395
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,243
Let's go, move it.
What is this?

396
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,045
I'll love you forever.

397
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:57,117
You kiss my "scrunchie", BJ.

398
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,120
I don't hear a thing.

399
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:03,150
I am gonna kill you.

400
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,753
I heard that.

401
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,766
Ooh God. Ooh, my car.

402
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,706
As soon as I get Harper,
I'll come after you BJ.

403
00:31:21,077 --> 00:31:23,179
Enjoy her BJ until she's alive.

404
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:30,114
Spread it on me, big boy.

405
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,588
I love mayo.

406
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,896
Yes... yes...

407
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,448
Jesus Christ.

408
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,717
I call you tomorrow.

409
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:17,662
Daddy's coming home.
Ooh, when I'm done whit you,

410
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:20,030
I'm gonna make your ass
look like you're a fag.

411
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,735
Look like a fag.

412
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,514
You see a lot of things in
this job...

413
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:35,582
but I've never thought I'd see anyone
trying the dirty deeds again.

414
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:38,552
That is what you're doing, right?

415
00:32:38,672 --> 00:32:41,185
Absolutely, sir.

416
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,988
Rock on, son.

417
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,610
This is whole wheat, right?

418
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,181
- Right?
- Right.

419
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:19,060
Hey man, my bad.

420
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,098
Here's your whole wheat.

421
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,033
This one's sour dough.

422
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:38,171
Out of my way, Harper.

423
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:42,986
Hey, Mr. Fuchs.

424
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,221
You have yourself
a good night now.

425
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,091
Two, two, two.

426
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,097
Three.

427
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,980
So, we got you for speeding,
driving an unregistered vehicle

428
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,783
and being a douchebag
after midnight.

429
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,423
Son, we got to sort all this out
down at the station house.

430
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:30,895
We know kind of stupid,
aren't you?

431
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,859
Put that down!

432
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,432
Beef off the table.

433
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,473
Off the table, thanks.

434
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,941
The couch is expensive.

435
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,002
Be careful.

436
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,310
- Sorry dude.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

437
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,354
Paul, rewind.
I gotta see that again.

438
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:09,129
A port from the market says,
you made a local bread very happy.

439
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,434
A gentleman never tells.

440
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,842
Hey cool, girls.

441
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,176
This asshole's got work to do.

442
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,081
Number 4...

443
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:24,609
You've got to drag that
big ass leprechaun

444
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:26,679
from Lucky's used car lot,

445
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:28,624
all the way to the high school.

446
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,760
In one peace.

447
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,028
Why are you sweating, Dan?
I'm the one doing the work.

448
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,504
I'm not sweating.

449
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:51,111
Yo, where's my marker?
My marker.

450
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:52,847
Not so bad dude.

451
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:55,544
Ooh, yeah.

452
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,054
- For me.
- My life is over.

453
00:35:58,355 --> 00:36:00,755
No, no, no, no, no, no!

454
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,283
I'm breaking up with you Brian,
because you don't have any guts.

455
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:05,758
You know who has guts?
The guy hosting this party.

456
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,730
Whoever he is.

457
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:12,665
Alison, I've heard you
broke up with Brian.

458
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:14,835
You know he was never
good enough for you.

459
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:21,742
Bri, I think I go now.

460
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,081
Right.

461
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,210
Dude. Dude did you hear that?
Go get her.

462
00:36:30,218 --> 00:36:32,549
Go, go, go.

463
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,964
Son of a...

464
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,978
Try a school board,
my friend.

465
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,630
Thought it would be easy, huh?

466
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,632
You supposed to be home.

467
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,634
I'm supposed to be doing the deeds,

468
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,636
but I got blocked by a senior
trying to show off.

469
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,401
You know what Kyle?
I've got it under control.

470
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,000
Obviously.

471
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,844
What? What?

472
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,515
Taking the blinds
is not gonna help.

473
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,989
- You got a better idea?
- Maybe I do.

474
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,318
There.

475
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,952
- Ready?
- Yeah.

476
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,557
That's the way it is done.

477
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,494
- Hey you find her?
- No.

478
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,522
Look harder.

479
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,769
- God, this is such a cool night.
- Yeah.

480
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,034
We switch the sprinklers on
without water flow,

481
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,042
hot air pours out from the heads,

482
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,578
The balloon inflates
and goes airborne.

483
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,547
- Or not.
- Since I have no other options.

484
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:48,248
I love it.

485
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,488
How long we give him, Laws?

486
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,256
I don't know.

487
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,527
Give him till about now.

488
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:09,260
Hey listen up everybody.

489
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:11,364
Listen up.
We got another loser.

490
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:14,441
As your class president,
I tried

491
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,938
to give you a kick ass
homecoming weekend.

492
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:21,279
But, unfortunately,
Harper has ruined it.

493
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:23,477
- He did it.
- What?

494
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,846
Ohh my...

495
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,824
I've wouldn't be making
any more speeches for a while.

496
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,996
Whatever, your
Harper's luck not gonna last.

497
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,562
Now will you go home?

498
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,633
Ok.

499
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,168
Look, I would have been screwed,
if you didn't show up tonight.

500
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,875
Same here.

501
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,088
I knew I'll find you here, Kyle.
Get in the car.

502
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,785
But I'm helping Zach to the deeds.
Look we get the leprechaun up.

503
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,819
- But, he just showed up.
- Yeah, and now he is going home.

504
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,298
He was just helping me out.
Don't be mad at him.

505
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:14,699
I'm not mad at him.

506
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,332
Look, Zach, I've always thought
you were different.

507
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:21,174
You were smarter than Lawton
and his macho crowd,

508
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,406
you cared about other things.

509
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,140
Still we have to do, but

510
00:41:26,256 --> 00:41:28,210
always be careful.

511
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,129
Four.

512
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,059
Hi.

513
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,528
So, you're having a good time?

514
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,828
Are you talking to me?

515
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,735
I'm Bobby DeSanchez.

516
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,938
Your host.

517
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,876
Bobby, hi.

518
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,749
It's 4 deeds
for Harper.

519
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:36,081
- Forget Harper.
- We got 4 for you right here.

520
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:44,417
Wait, wait, I wanna
remember this forever.

521
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,087
That's enough.

522
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,404
Sorry that took so long.
Were you guys worried?

523
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,998
A little. I was.

524
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:03,278
You're not even halfway there yet.

525
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,839
- Don't get cocky, Harper.
- You're the boss.

526
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,078
For now.

527
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:17,323
What is it?

528
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,090
- What is it, Zach?
- Come on, Zach.

529
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:27,763
Hey, Stash,

530
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,237
I thought you were at the party.

531
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,536
Yeah, well I need a little pain pill,
it's been 6 hours.

532
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,840
- Been 2 hours.
- Anyways. There's a lot of kids drinking.

533
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,938
I couldn't be a part of it.
I'm trying to clean in my ab.

534
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,108
You want help me steal
a dead body?

535
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,017
Cool.

536
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,884
Steal a dead body

537
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,583
and put it in the middle
of the school.

538
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,898
Evening, Mr. Rasdale.

539
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,300
How things out of the lodge?

540
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:04,371
Wait, José, what's it to you?

541
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,339
My name is Ryan, sir.
Did you want your usual?

542
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,606
How do you know what my usual is?

543
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,443
Because you come in every night,
before your shift start.

544
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,382
Don't get smart with me, Luis.

545
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,614
It's homecoming weekend.
Dirty deeds time.

546
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,179
Sir...

547
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,818
Deeds got me once,
here's a go.

548
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,362
It's not gonna happen again.

549
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,057
Those are preordered.

550
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:32,132
You tell any of your hombres,
that if they are even thinking,

551
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,667
even tick about the deeds,

552
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,003
Vic Rasdale is waiting for them.

553
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,242
Serve your coffee, sir?

554
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,249
Something you can spit into?

555
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,979
You'd like that, wouldn't ya, Miguel?

556
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,022
Very much, sir.

557
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,862
A Newton imperial.

558
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,024
That's about to hard to pick
as my ass.

559
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,159
Talk this loud and you pick your ass?

560
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,795
It's the same lock they
have on most docker's offices.

561
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,203
Not that I've ever broken
into any of them to steal drugs

562
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:13,107
- back when I was using.
- That's a load off my mind.

563
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:21,081
Evelyn Easterbrook. Loving wife,
mother and grandmother.

564
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,853
Service Thursday.
No.

565
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,953
Anything?

566
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,961
Jerry Noblock.
Friend to all.

567
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,795
No flowers make donations
to boys athletic club.

568
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,300
Nice guy.

569
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:43,569
What you got?

570
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,973
John Doe. Found in park.
No roots

571
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,841
No service scheduled.

572
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,176
He's got nobody.

573
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,644
He's got us.

574
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,081
So I speak to the big,
that if someone is trying the deeds,

575
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,556
I'll throw a big party.

576
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,684
Hey you guys got
everything you need?

577
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,661
Alright, yeah.

578
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:09,426
Then I just told my parents
to clear out.

579
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,904
Come on, come on, hurry.

580
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,974
Careful, careful, wait the door.

581
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,978
- Move.
- Hey man.

582
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:33,314
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

583
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,998
Are you pocket, John?
This guy is a maniac.

584
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,504
And let me know if
there is too much air.

585
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,567
- He's good.
- Yeah.

586
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,808
- I told you wrap it tighter.
- And I ignored you.

587
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:09,923
- Shit.
- Pull the car over.

588
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,464
Get back cover him, quick.

589
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,463
Reported a break in.

590
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,732
Swan Point funeral.

591
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:26,674
Ohh, shit.

592
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:30,235
- Harper, Harper, Harper.
- Sir.

593
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,576
You know why I've stopped you?

594
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:35,648
Fighting real crime is hard, sir.

595
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:39,786
Wrong, cause 30 mph
does not mean 38.

596
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,155
I'm sorry, officer.

597
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,717
Who the hell is that
back there?

598
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:49,593
Well, that's Stash
and his uncle.

599
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,897
He had a rough night.

600
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,699
No shit.

601
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:57,797
Officer Dill, I'm just trying to
get the guy home.

602
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,867
He is really just dead...
drunk.

603
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,977
I can see that.

604
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:09,048
Alright, I'm gonna let you
slide this time.

605
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:13,020
Thank you, thank you.

606
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,054
And one more thing.

607
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:18,554
And Harper, your vehicle registration

608
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,563
expires at the end of...

609
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:27,966
I mean that is just wrong
on so many levels.

610
00:48:28,504 --> 00:48:30,605
Tell me about it.

611
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:34,134
Get him the hell out of here.

612
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:41,183
There are a lot of sick people
in this world.

613
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,516
Now, how very cool is that?

614
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,391
Five.

615
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,960
Yeah, I'm here.

616
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,732
You wanna go upstairs?

617
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,910
I don't wanna move, ever.

618
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,674
But aren't there bedrooms upstairs?

619
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,951
- I'm sure there are.
- Can you get me a drink first?

620
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,987
Ohh yeah, sure.

621
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,351
- How is it going?
- Unbelievable.

622
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:25,224
I may be dead tomorrow,
but I'm gonna die a man.

623
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,859
She's so hot.

624
00:49:41,677 --> 00:49:43,110
Six.

625
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:46,179
You don't talk as much
as you used to, Dan?

626
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,183
Just do the damn deed.

627
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,719
Bring back a homecoming queen's bra.

628
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,220
Signed.

629
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:56,620
Hey, Jen.

630
00:49:56,692 --> 00:49:59,685
Yeah, right.

631
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,848
What is it?

632
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,251
- Is Amy home, sir?
- Who the hell are you?

633
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:28,452
Zach Harper.
You Amy's dad?

634
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:31,390
No, I'm her big brother.

635
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,861
I can see that.

636
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,891
Is she home?
I just need to get a bra from her.

637
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:42,059
But she doesn't have to
be wearing it.

638
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:43,806
You know what kid?
Why don't you come back tomorrow,

639
00:50:43,813 --> 00:50:45,504
when it's light out?

640
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:48,043
And then, when I swing at you,
I won't miss!

641
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,909
You got it.

642
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,350
Hello.

643
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,579
Hello, Miss Moskowitz.
Zach Harper.

644
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,451
I was two years behind Leah
in high school.

645
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:03,385
Ohh, yes Zach, who could forget you?
Is everything alright honey?

646
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:04,886
What's going on?

647
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,653
Well, I think you gonna get
kind of a kick out of this.

648
00:51:08,297 --> 00:51:10,188
I was wondering if I could swing by,

649
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:12,158
pick up some of her underwear.

650
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:16,735
Hello?

651
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:20,942
Yes.

652
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,843
- Jennifer, hey, Zach Harper.
- Zach, it's late.

653
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,080
Ah yeah, well,
it's late for me too,

654
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:28,982
but I think you gonna get
kind of a kick out of this.

655
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,119
<i>You see,
I need one of your bras.</i>

656
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,714
<i>Just for a while.
I promise I'll give it back.</i>

657
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,988
You know what?
You're sick Zach, sick.

658
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:41,691
What was that about?

659
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:44,358
Did I say you could speak, slave?

660
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:47,765
Sorry, mistress, sorry.

661
00:51:47,777 --> 00:51:49,931
May I have another?

662
00:51:57,312 --> 00:51:58,471
Yeah.

663
00:51:58,488 --> 00:52:01,111
You're looking for a homecoming queen?

664
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:03,283
Who is this?

665
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,882
Someone, who wants to see
you take Lawton down.

666
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:08,886
Someone who knows where you
can find what you're looking for.

667
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,725
I'm listening.

668
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:15,628
Vicky Crabbe.
Queen from 5 years ago.

669
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,358
She's got an apartment on 47
Grandview,

670
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,495
downtown, across the street
at the Excelsior hotel.

671
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,129
She's home now.

672
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:24,536
Grandview, got it.

673
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:34,540
I've been had,
a setup and knocked over.

674
00:52:34,548 --> 00:52:36,918
Five deeds down
five more to go,

675
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,954
and it looked like that the night
was coming to an abrupt ending.

676
00:52:40,183 --> 00:52:42,483
You know, It's amazing
how the best ideas come

677
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,150
in the most desperate times.

678
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,654
Cause I had to piss
like it was nobody's business.

679
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:51,731
It's a good thing,
Excelsior hotel's across the street.

680
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:06,815
Can I use your men's room?

681
00:53:07,383 --> 00:53:09,147
Bathroom is for customers.

682
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,378
Then, I don't know
I'll take a beer.

683
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:13,522
Maybe in a couple of years.

684
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,115
Make it a Coke.

685
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:17,725
$6.50.

686
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:24,528
Am I a customer now?

687
00:53:25,401 --> 00:53:27,765
Men's room is on your right, sir.

688
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,484
So kid, what's her name?

689
00:53:42,492 --> 00:53:44,017
What?

690
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,113
The girl, that put that nasty look
on your face. What's her name?

691
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,715
What do you mean?

692
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:52,557
You're a mess.
What did she do to you?

693
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:57,188
Look, this has nothing
to do with the girl, OK?

694
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:01,565
OK, a little bit.

695
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:06,238
OK. Fine, a lot.
Like 80%.

696
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:08,677
There you go.

697
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,037
Now here is the deal.

698
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:13,976
I'm doing this high school thing,

699
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,549
mostly so that her brother
won't have to.

700
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,881
But the real reason is...

701
00:54:21,255 --> 00:54:23,091
she's great.

702
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:26,423
Pretty, smart,

703
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:29,787
not into the games
that everyone else says.

704
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:33,459
And she probably has
no idea how you feel.

705
00:54:34,135 --> 00:54:36,235
Hey, it's her loss.

706
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,277
Are you trying to?

707
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,782
Pick you up?

708
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,284
Are you?

709
00:54:52,855 --> 00:54:55,017
No, I'm just...

710
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,116
Let's stick to what's
really bothering you.

711
00:54:57,593 --> 00:55:00,219
Talking helps you.

712
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:03,265
Nothing's gonna help now,
unless you're a homecoming queen

713
00:55:03,282 --> 00:55:05,027
at West Valley.

714
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,506
Rachel Buff, sir,
class of '99,

715
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:14,000
homecoming theme:
"Reach for the stars".

716
00:55:14,837 --> 00:55:16,445
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

717
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:18,842
My mom still has
my honor at the piano.

718
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:22,049
So what can I do for you?

719
00:55:22,077 --> 00:55:23,750
Actually,

720
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,687
I think you might get
kind of a kick out of this.

721
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,628
You mind helping me
with the clasp?

722
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:37,063
That would be a... sure.

723
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:38,801
Sure, I can.

724
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:44,638
- Your hands are cold.
- Sorry.

725
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:47,137
- So it's how? What number deed is this?
- Six.

726
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:51,311
Six, ohh my god.
It's closing in on Duncan Rime.

727
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,545
You're a stud.

728
00:55:58,153 --> 00:56:00,245
There you go.

729
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:03,951
You're the greatest person
I've ever met.

730
00:56:03,976 --> 00:56:04,960
Thank you.

731
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:08,326
Do you have a pen?

732
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,762
Hey, did you found her yet?

733
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,501
- No.
- OK, keep looking.

734
00:56:19,902 --> 00:56:21,102
Alison?

735
00:56:26,115 --> 00:56:27,449
How do I know this is legit?

736
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,448
Well I got her on picture phone, too.

737
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,988
Hey everybody, it's Rachel Buff.

738
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:35,918
Sorry that you had to wait,
I'll see you tomorrow at homecoming.

739
00:56:35,942 --> 00:56:38,260
Better be there.
Go, Vikings.

740
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,827
Ohh and there's more.

741
00:56:43,228 --> 00:56:45,299
That'd be yours, Danny boy.

742
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:52,501
Whatever.
Here you go.

743
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,844
Lucky number seven.

744
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,211
It's never gonna happen, Harper.

745
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,880
You've been right
so far, Dan.

746
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,497
Ohh, shit.

747
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,166
Ohh, God.

748
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:26,140
Those assholes.

749
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:29,178
Son of a... bitch

750
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:41,520
Alison, I've been looking
all over for you.

751
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:44,924
Sorry, Bobby, I had to pee
and the line was like a mile long.

752
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:47,863
So where were we?

753
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,931
I was about to go upstairs
with the guy with your gut.

754
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:54,765
Hey man, you should have
seen him pissed up,

755
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:57,201
when we told him,
he had to hold this rager.

756
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,538
I'd thought he shit himself.
Right, douche?

757
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,443
Douche, douche.

758
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:12,912
Wait, hold on.

759
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:24,359
Kyle can't come out and play.

760
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,930
Just go away.

761
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,228
Look, Meg. Can I borrow your car?

762
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:31,737
Are you serious?

763
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,342
Yeah, Lawton's goons
slashed my tires.

764
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,911
Ohh, my. You don't expect
that from goons.

765
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,080
- I need to get to the Patriot Lodge.
- That's the deed?

766
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,880
And...

767
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,080
kind of borrow the night watchman's leg?

768
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,823
Ohh, OK, Yeah, yeah. Well,
as long as it is for a good cause.

769
00:58:48,891 --> 00:58:51,658
Meg, look nothing will happen to your car.

770
00:58:51,668 --> 00:58:55,155
Look.
You can't have my car.

771
00:58:57,266 --> 00:59:01,834
Meg. I've got nobody else to go to.
Please.

772
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:14,945
Stash's lock picking tools.

773
00:59:14,957 --> 00:59:16,446
I'll be right back.

774
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,844
- Zach...
- You told me your folks are out of town

775
00:59:18,871 --> 00:59:21,181
and you're worried that Kyle
is gonna sneak out again.

776
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:23,316
I'll be as quick as I can.

777
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:27,424
No, I was actually gonna say,
good luck.

778
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,130
Look. I know I can
get too serious sometimes.

779
00:59:34,502 --> 00:59:35,761
It's OK.

780
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:45,771
You'd be better going.

781
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:47,773
Right.

782
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:33,151
Shit.

783
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:42,465
This is a private club, son.

784
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:46,038
And we don't cut into
a lot of things here.

785
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:50,578
Integration, breaking and entering.

786
01:00:51,246 --> 01:00:53,306
I suggest

787
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,682
you show yourself
with 3 things up in the air:

788
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,319
Your hands and my leg.

789
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:06,051
Otherwise, Vic Rasdale is gonna be filling

790
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:08,727
this fine antique,

791
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,299
with buckshot.

792
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:14,664
And your ass will be hanging
on our trophy wall.

793
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:18,332
Now, I am gonna count to 50.

794
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:22,636
48, 49...

795
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,824
- You saved me.
- Yeah, you can thank me later.

796
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:12,158
- Let's get you home.
- No, no. You have to do more deeds.

797
01:02:12,178 --> 01:02:14,762
Look.
You can just take my car.

798
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,763
- What?
- Yeah.

799
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:18,293
I can't believe
you're doing this.

800
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,562
I can't believe I've just
flashed Rasdale.

801
01:02:20,836 --> 01:02:22,770
Go. Go, go, go.

802
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:27,239
A couple of pricks got my leg.

803
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,577
I only saw the girl.

804
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:36,283
But I got a real good
look at her, alright.

805
01:02:40,455 --> 01:02:43,218
You mean describe her face?

806
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:49,687
Well I can't.

807
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,665
Hey Dan. I bet you're wondering
how much you owe me

808
01:03:00,673 --> 01:03:03,476
- for the flat tires.
- Here's deed number eight.

809
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:06,845
Here comes deed no. two,
just catching up with you.

810
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:10,916
- That spare leg should come in handy.
- Shit.

811
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,387
This is gonna hurt a little.

812
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,551
Hey asshole.

813
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:25,229
You better lie here.

814
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:28,800
Hey, Mullet.

815
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:31,596
- You ok, man?
- Yeah.

816
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:33,405
Yeah, man, thanks.

817
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,440
Tell me you're thinking about
bailing on this deeds thing.

818
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:37,980
Why about this time,
when it's starting to get fun?

819
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:44,084
Thanks.

820
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:47,284
- Made his calling.
- My God, my God.

821
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,081
No

822
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:45,940
It's not a threat.

823
01:04:46,014 --> 01:04:48,148
Could you tell him it's
a favor for me.

824
01:04:48,216 --> 01:04:50,944
And I don't have to call myself.
Yeah, hang on.

825
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:54,414
There is an extra ten bucks for you kid,
if you bring her back cherry.

826
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,125
Yeah, very good.

827
01:05:19,848 --> 01:05:21,975
Come on, Alison, I was desperate,

828
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:23,184
As soon as death's been seeing
you right in the face,

829
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,020
- I didn't think I'd live trough another day.
- Look do you wanna whine

830
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,780
or do you wanna go upstairs?

831
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:32,858
Hey, a freshman hitting on a senior?

832
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,395
Pretty guts.

833
01:05:46,267 --> 01:05:47,532
Ohh, God,

834
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:49,409
some shortcut.

835
01:05:57,284 --> 01:05:58,876
Kyle.

836
01:05:59,154 --> 01:06:02,356
Kyle, you're awake?

837
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:05,393
What's going on?

838
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,025
You deal this time, Kyle.

839
01:06:09,197 --> 01:06:10,788
We were just playing for pennies.

840
01:06:10,966 --> 01:06:12,800
It's nice rally game, for now.

841
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:15,136
Who are you?

842
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:16,838
I'm the last man in the world,
you wanna piss off.

843
01:06:18,106 --> 01:06:20,298
You see, your boyfriend
stole my Ferrari.

844
01:06:20,316 --> 01:06:23,002
Dumb ass left your
crap box car at the club.

845
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,573
A cop buddy run the plates,
and guess what? Here I am.

846
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,912
Look, Kyle has nothing
to do with this. OK?

847
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:31,051
Kyle has everything to do with this,

848
01:06:31,086 --> 01:06:33,552
because if I don't get
my vehicle back very soon,

849
01:06:33,587 --> 01:06:36,382
Me and homo'll gonna play
for bigger stakes.

850
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:03,548
Lawton, where did you get
that piece of shit car?

851
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:06,412
I'll bet you're surprised
to see me right now.

852
01:07:06,488 --> 01:07:08,683
If I'd had a little beat down
to make me quit?

853
01:07:08,857 --> 01:07:11,121
What? What did you do?

854
01:07:11,793 --> 01:07:14,456
He tried to throw me with
the animals at the zoo.

855
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,662
That's bullshit, Dan,
you know it.

856
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,023
Doesn't even matter anymore.

857
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,299
Because the last two are lost,
when i figured

858
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:25,370
- he wasn't coming back.
- Well I'm glad I've picked them up, then.

859
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:37,210
What does it say?

860
01:07:39,786 --> 01:07:41,219
"Find Duncan Rime".

861
01:07:43,224 --> 01:07:44,817
Yep, that's what it says.

862
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,524
There's no way that
that is a deed.

863
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,329
Hey I don't write the deeds,
Harper.

864
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,931
I'm just gonna enjoy the fact,
that you're gonna choke on this one.

865
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:59,664
It's a tough spot, Harper,
and my heart goes out to you.

866
01:07:59,732 --> 01:08:01,520
I mean you must be saying
how do I find a guy,

867
01:08:01,525 --> 01:08:04,213
who doesn't even exist any more?

868
01:08:05,691 --> 01:08:07,114
Over here.

869
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,917
I'm Duncan Rime.

870
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:17,822
- What?
- What?

871
01:08:20,293 --> 01:08:22,393
The picture is a little old.

872
01:08:22,414 --> 01:08:24,293
But it's me.

873
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:26,866
I don't believe this shit.

874
01:08:33,942 --> 01:08:35,876
What happened to you?

875
01:08:36,144 --> 01:08:37,742
Long story.

876
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:40,411
It started way back,

877
01:08:40,429 --> 01:08:42,750
senior year in high school.

878
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:44,911
You should have seen me.

879
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:49,148
I've had the best car,

880
01:08:49,484 --> 01:08:51,750
hottest girl,

881
01:08:52,427 --> 01:08:55,187
and I've figured to do the one thing,
nobody had ever done,

882
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,893
would be the perfect caper.

883
01:08:57,765 --> 01:08:59,859
You did all ten dirty deeds.

884
01:09:00,235 --> 01:09:02,933
No, at my day there were only eight deeds.

885
01:09:03,505 --> 01:09:05,739
So the rules say you gotta add
to the list if somebody

886
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:06,536
gets trough them.

887
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:09,343
- Why?
- No reason.

888
01:09:10,211 --> 01:09:12,210
No reason for any of this.

889
01:09:13,281 --> 01:09:14,572
But I didn't get that

890
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:16,443
until I was out in the real world.

891
01:09:17,519 --> 01:09:21,719
Then I've realized just how
miserable I've been all trough high school.

892
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,160
It's just playing some bullshit game,

893
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,061
pretending I was cool.

894
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:30,888
If you keep playing by the rules,

895
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:34,424
- they are always gonna beat ya.
- Right.

896
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:37,130
Even when you think you'd won.

897
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,308
What the hell are you doing?

898
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,953
Give me the last deed.

899
01:10:07,969 --> 01:10:10,331
This is a waste of time,

900
01:10:10,405 --> 01:10:13,867
and you are a waste of skin.

901
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:16,607
- Ohh, yeah.
- Tear it.

902
01:10:31,959 --> 01:10:34,025
Ohh, shit.

903
01:10:34,095 --> 01:10:35,362
- You are under arrest, Harper.
- For what?

904
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,798
- For doing the dirty deeds.
- That's not a charge.

905
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:41,233
Yeah, how about grand theft auto?

906
01:10:41,803 --> 01:10:43,287
The kid didn't steal anything.

907
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,772
That's not what my report said.

908
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,272
Well the report you got can eat me?
Alright?

909
01:10:47,307 --> 01:10:49,643
It's my car and I let it to the kid.

910
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:52,779
And I'm just gonna assume that
you won't have a problem with that.

911
01:10:54,848 --> 01:10:56,549
Mr. Scarno.

912
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,687
Well good evening, sir.

913
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:03,021
You know, I don't think an exchange
of paperwork is in our best interest.

914
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:04,826
What is in our best interest

915
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:07,628
is for you to let the boy go
and I go on my merry way.

916
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,690
Does that sound good?

917
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,699
Well, yeah, I...

918
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,335
he can...

919
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:15,667
just...

920
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:21,442
Good night, Officer Dill

921
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,405
-do.

922
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:26,141
See you dildo.

923
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,316
Go home.

924
01:11:39,894 --> 01:11:42,086
Except you, valet.

925
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,897
You're with me.

926
01:11:45,165 --> 01:11:47,325
Don't worry. Nothing's gonna
happen to your boyfriend.

927
01:11:47,362 --> 01:11:48,168
He's not my boyfriend.

928
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:50,364
He almost got my brother killed.

929
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,367
What?

930
01:11:53,274 --> 01:11:55,607
Yeah, you know you almost did.
Let's go.

931
01:12:13,227 --> 01:12:14,823
Bobby...

932
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,092
Are you coming?

933
01:12:18,826 --> 01:12:21,260
Ohh, yeah honey.

934
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,579
Come in.

935
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:43,650
- Me too.
- Bri, I'm kind of busy here.

936
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:46,024
Well I'm worried about you.

937
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:50,089
- You really shouldn't be alone right now.
- I'm not.

938
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:53,456
You've found a guy?
I'm jealous.

939
01:12:54,335 --> 01:12:56,333
Of him or of me?

940
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,374
Are you ready for Bobby?

941
01:13:01,112 --> 01:13:02,270
Two?

942
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:08,376
Two, two.

943
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:11,284
Ohh, yeah, thank you.

944
01:13:21,362 --> 01:13:23,788
The parent's are home.
Two.

945
01:13:23,865 --> 01:13:26,399
- The parents.
- I need to get out of here.

946
01:13:37,277 --> 01:13:39,175
The parents are home.
- The parents.

947
01:13:39,246 --> 01:13:40,371
Hey, girls you need a ride?

948
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,248
- Give it. It's mine.
- Give it

949
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,750
- It's mine, it's mine.
- Give it.

950
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,885
Where're you going?

951
01:13:51,459 --> 01:13:52,859
You'd help bro?

952
01:13:54,629 --> 01:13:55,856
Fuck.

953
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:57,930
I'm ready.

954
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,299
Yeah, you are.

955
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,199
I'm not. Come on.

956
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:09,066
Now what are we gonna do?

957
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,702
Everyone get out.

958
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:14,010
Everyone get out. Go.

959
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:16,778
Who are you kids?

960
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:23,419
What is this?

961
01:14:29,363 --> 01:14:31,204
I've got what the place used to look like,

962
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,629
- for the insurance company.
- Ohh, my god.

963
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:37,326
Robert.

964
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:41,166
What are you doing in our house?

965
01:14:41,513 --> 01:14:43,626
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Seaver,

966
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:46,206
Hi, I... I was just leaving.

967
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:52,818
I'm calling his mother, right now.

968
01:15:04,932 --> 01:15:07,192
This could work.

969
01:15:11,005 --> 01:15:12,136
Thanks, Millie.

970
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,106
You know I've used to pull a lot of cars
when I was coming up,

971
01:15:17,129 --> 01:15:19,814
but I never did your valet bit.
That was smart...

972
01:15:20,534 --> 01:15:22,737
when you don't leave a car behind.

973
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:23,714
My first day.

974
01:15:23,749 --> 01:15:26,881
So you did all this,
just to get that dickwad in BMW

975
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:28,685
stop picking on her brother?

976
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:31,716
I can see why you wanted
to get on a good sign.

977
01:15:33,393 --> 01:15:34,693
I can tell you I'm very impressed.

978
01:15:35,263 --> 01:15:38,228
- You're 17?
- 18.

979
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,128
I've killed 3 men,
by the time I was 18.

980
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:45,205
Legally, in Vietnam.

981
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:47,742
I've signed up to
get away from my father.

982
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,104
You see, my father was
an asshole.

983
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:54,571
He did teach me
one thing, though.

984
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,714
That I didn't need him, and that's
an important lesson to learn.

985
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:00,778
Because when you depend on
people, they disappoint you.

986
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:03,916
You gotta step up yourself,
like you did tonight.

987
01:16:05,192 --> 01:16:07,792
Well it took me till I was 20,
sitting in a jungle.

988
01:16:08,862 --> 01:16:10,123
What did you do?

989
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:11,958
We had this lieutenant,
who was determined to get us all killed.

990
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:15,135
So, I've got him sent home.

991
01:16:16,403 --> 01:16:17,703
How?

992
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:19,799
I kicked the shit out of him.

993
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:26,946
This better be good. I told my mom
I'd be home by now.

994
01:16:27,815 --> 01:16:29,676
I'll write you a note.

995
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,724
Pop the damn leprechaun.
Just get it off my football field.

996
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:45,358
Where is maintenance?

997
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:48,261
Dealing with what dead body?

998
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:54,237
Damn those I.A.B.'s.

999
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:58,245
Zachary, it's my card.

1000
01:16:59,513 --> 01:17:01,840
You ever need anything, call that number.

1001
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:07,655
- Zach.
- Look Zachary, it's dickwad's little girly.

1002
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:09,657
Lawton gave the
tenth deed to Riplock.

1003
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,658
- So?
- So he is gonna ruin the homecoming carnival.

1004
01:17:12,688 --> 01:17:15,756
- That's what the tenth deed said to do.
- Look I'm way past caring.

1005
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:18,925
You're gonna get blamed. The cops
know you're the one doing the dirty deeds.

1006
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,491
How do I know your boyfriend
didn't put you up to this?

1007
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:23,334
He's not my boyfriend anymore.

1008
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:26,574
Look Riplock said he's gonna
pack the stage with fireworks

1009
01:17:26,581 --> 01:17:28,204
and scare the hell out
of everybody.

1010
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:31,434
- So watch people get scared. So what?
- These are M-80s.

1011
01:17:31,463 --> 01:17:34,381
Zach, something could catch fire.
People could panic.

1012
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:37,510
And Meg's on the stage having
the honor society, remember?

1013
01:17:40,588 --> 01:17:42,822
- What time is it?
- 8:30.

1014
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,482
- It starts at 9:00.
- Where is this thing?

1015
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,851
- The football field at the school.
- We should get going.

1016
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:50,688
- It's gonna be close.
- Here, take the car.

1017
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:53,691
- We? - Well you don't mind stealing it,
when I flip you the keys?

1018
01:17:53,718 --> 01:17:56,262
- What about you?
- I've got something to do. Go on.

1019
01:18:08,949 --> 01:18:10,943
Yeah, who's working today?

1020
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:36,870
Yeah. That's it, move it
back three feet.

1021
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,150
- I'm gonna go look for Zach.
- Ok.

1022
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:28,427
Thank you being so prompt,
Miss Cummings.

1023
01:19:28,596 --> 01:19:29,788
Let's get this show on the road.

1024
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,292
Instruments up. Ready?
Let's play people.

1025
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:35,798
- Hey Stash, have you seen Zach?
- Hey I'm looking for him too.

1026
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,738
He's got my painpills.

1027
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:47,940
Hey pal, what part of 30 miles an hour
didn't you understand?

1028
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,644
We got Harper?

1029
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,486
I'll catch him.
Come on.

1030
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,858
May I have your attention, please?

1031
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:11,502
Yeah, we have a long programme
to get trough, people.

1032
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:19,203
Our presentations this morning
will be given out

1033
01:20:19,238 --> 01:20:22,114
by Miss Rachel Buff.

1034
01:20:22,183 --> 01:20:24,283
Yeah.

1035
01:20:24,852 --> 01:20:26,979
Who is not quiet here yet.

1036
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:40,925
Meg, get off the stage.

1037
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,502
Meg get off the stage, it's gonna
blow up. Get off the stage.

1038
01:20:45,673 --> 01:20:49,238
- People, welcome to state high in...
- Not in scenario Fuchs.

1039
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,710
- I got you, Harper.
- Look. Officer Dill.

1040
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,915
No, you look.
You're under arrest.

1041
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,723
Ohh, my God.

1042
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:18,931
Holy shit.

1043
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,337
Bevins, stay with Harper.

1044
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:26,675
- God, he's such a dildo.
- What?

1045
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:30,017
Go on, get out of here.
Get out of here.

1046
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,683
- Let's Go.
- Come on.

1047
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:35,184
Homie's truck blew up man.

1048
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:38,522
Mom, yeah.

1049
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:41,721
My truck just blew up.
I don't know.

1050
01:21:41,996 --> 01:21:44,764
No. Don't yell at me.

1051
01:21:45,732 --> 01:21:47,997
Harper, what the hell is this?

1052
01:21:48,109 --> 01:21:50,262
Pretty damn cool.

1053
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:53,733
Mr. Fuchs, It's All Bullshit.

1054
01:21:54,608 --> 01:21:58,108
I.A.B.
"It's All Bullshit".

1055
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:01,782
I just thought you might
wanna know.

1056
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:10,017
This is gonna get me
to film school, for sure.

1057
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,724
Hi, Paul.

1058
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:15,489
- You were awesome.
- Thank you, baby.

1059
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,398
- Ohh, Paul, tell me you got that.
- I got that.

1060
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:20,261
The I.A.B. Sees all.

1061
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,668
So cool.

1062
01:22:22,937 --> 01:22:25,738
So Zachary, the boys do nice work?

1063
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:30,109
Yeah they do.

1064
01:22:30,778 --> 01:22:34,578
Thanks.
Thanks for everything.

1065
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:39,214
- We gotta run.
- Hey, kid...

1066
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:42,549
There is an extra 10 in it for you
if you bring her back cherry.

1067
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:47,524
BJ, you're a bad boy.

1068
01:22:48,295 --> 01:22:51,556
Seven years and I've
never missed a homecoming.

1069
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:55,232
And I never will.

1070
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,364
I'll love you forever.

1071
01:22:57,388 --> 01:22:59,766
Double head for BJ.

1072
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,969
I'm with you, pal.
I'm with you.

1073
01:23:04,044 --> 01:23:06,911
Yes, yes, at West Valley
high school.

1074
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:09,272
There has been an explosion.

1075
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,848
The main field.

1076
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,080
Excus...

1077
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:21,286
- You.
- Lieutenant, you remember.

1078
01:23:21,362 --> 01:23:23,662
That is so sweet.

1079
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:26,926
You.

1080
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,401
You, You, You...

1081
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,875
So are you still mad at me?

1082
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,946
Furious, can you tell?

1083
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:56,460
Bevins, get over here
give me a hand.

1084
01:24:00,234 --> 01:24:03,767
Who's that douchebag,
who got us this fire extinguisher?

1085
01:24:08,175 --> 01:24:09,737
There you have it.

1086
01:24:09,741 --> 01:24:12,011
My page in the dirty deeds legend.

1087
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,981
You might ask what's
the gain from any of this.

1088
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,740
Do I need to say any more?

1089
