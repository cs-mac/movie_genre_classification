00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,861
and I wanna tap that without you there.
You got it?

320
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,274
You know, first of all,
Steven, it's my house.

321
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,067
You're lucky I'm
letting you stay here.

322
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,361
Look, you wanted me to
get a job, so I got one.

323
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,201
At least let me have the
house for the weekend.

324
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,616
My house, my rules.

325
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,080
<i>And as for tonight, if you
don't wanna risk coming home</i>

326
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,870
<i>and seeing more of your
mother than you'd like,</i>

327
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,710
I suggest you stay out late.

328
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,000
Gross.

329
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,294
(ALL LAUGHING)

330
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,306
That was really...

331
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,682
Hey, bar wench,
can I get a Budweiser?

332
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,471
Beer down.

333
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,359
What the fuck are you
fuckers doing here?

334
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,031
You made it! Made what?

335
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,157
What are you talking about?

336
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,243
What do you mean?
We sent you an e-mail

337
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,125
about getting together a couple
of days before the reunion.

338
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,209
You know what? I must have put
two F's in "Stifmeister."

339
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,793
JIM: What? KEVIN: I'm sorry.

340
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,627
(LAUGHS)

341
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,008
Two F's? You dumbass!

342
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,384
Kev!

343
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,340
Hey, Kevin, is that
a pussy on your face?

344
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,801
(TRILLING LIPS) Oh, come on!

345
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,685
Yeah, yeah, yeah! (SNIFFING)

346
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,886
Nice.

347
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,643
So, Stifler,
you're looking sharp.

348
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,144
What are you up to these days?

349
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,601
I work at JBH Global.

350
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,686
Wow! That's a big-time firm.

351
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
What do you do over there?

352
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,189
Oh, you know,

353
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,366
investment stuff.

354
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,203
People wonder why our financial
system's falling apart.

355
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,327
Nice scarf. I see you finally
came out of the closet.

356
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,036
How is your mother, Stifler?

357
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,917
You stay away from
my mom, shitbreak.

358
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,579
Okay, boys,
the past is the past.

359
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,289
We can bury
the hatchet here, huh?

360
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,045
Yeah, fuck it.

361
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,960
Hey, short-shorts!
A round of Jägerbombs for me and my boys!

362
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,470
Go fuck yourself, Stifler.

363
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,011
How the hell does
she know my name?

364
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,055
STIFLER: (CACKLING) Lard Arms?

365
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,306
JIM: Jesus, Stifler.

366
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,354
Talk about an ugly duckling
turning into a swan, right?

367
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,350
Let me see that.

368
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,774
Oh! Fingered her,
hairy nips, huge boobs.

369
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,443
Oh. (MOANS)

370
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,619
There she is!

371
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,738
<i>The créme de my cock.</i>

372
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,573
Blowjob Lipstein.

373
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,082
Her given name
was Loni, Stifler.

374
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,962
She used to call me Big Stiffy.

375
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,963
She was the mouth
that got away.

376
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,172
Last call!

377
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,464
Already? Wait here, guys.

378
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,933
Oh! Man, the Senior Wish List.

379
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,060
Wish List?
I don't remember that.

380
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,854
Oh, yeah, man.
It's that cheesy page in the yearbook

381
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,058
where we all had to write
wishes about our future.

382
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,019
What, did you write something cheesy?
Let's see.

383
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,941
"Chris Ostreicher.
Hopes to coach his son's lacrosse team."

384
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,242
Oh! Isn't that the
sweetest thing?

385
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,534
Well,

386
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,742
I guess I thought
I'd have a family by now.

387
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,119
All right, you wanna hear
what you wrote, Finch?

388
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,290
FINCH: I do.

389
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,249
"Paul Finch hopes to
find le grand amour."

390
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,539
Yes, true love.

391
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,256
Alas, I have yet to find what you
would call a real relationship.

392
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,047
Right, because banging
Stifler's mom didn't count.

393
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,262
OZ: All right, let's see
what you got, Kev.

394
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,850
"Kevin Myers. Hopes to
still be living it up"

395
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,106
"with the amazing
Vicky Lathum."

396
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,562
Oh, man! Vicky! What?

397
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,023
I am sure your wife would
be very happy to read that.

398
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,938
What? I was dating
Vicky at the time.

399
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,447
Let me see what I put.

400
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,902
"Jim Levenstein"

401
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,086
"hopes to have the
sex life of Ricky Martin."

402
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,917
So, I'm assuming you didn't
know he was gay back then.

403
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,672
Jim, it's a good thing
you found a woman

404
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,595
with the sex drive
of a dozen groupies. Hmm?

405
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,006
I mean, you're probably having
more sex than any of us.

406
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,350
Probably, you know.

407
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,513
Hope you guys are thirsty.
Stifler Claus is here.

408
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,273
Whoa! Stifler, that's a little
too much, don't you think?

409
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,526
Dude, find your balls
and return them to your sack.

410
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,690
I say we keep this party going.

411
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,693
I say we make this
weekend our bitch.

412
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,325
We could party together, do all the
same shit that we used to do together.

413
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,827
It'll be just like old times.

414
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,659
Hell yes! That's why I'm here.

415
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,324
<i>No Bachelorette,
no Real Housewives.</i>

416
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,041
Thing is, you only get one
chance at your 13th reunion.

417
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,583
I was kind of hoping to spend
a little time with the wife.

418
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
Fuck! Dude!

419
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,171
James? What? Come on!

420
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,014
I mean, I'm in. Of course I'm in.
Come on, what?

421
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,174
Yeah! Yeah.

422
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,932
Then, gentlemen, I hope you're
all wearing protection,

423
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,142
because this weekend,
we're gonna fuck shit up!

424
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,978
JIM: Cheers!
OZ: Yeah! All right!

425
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,024
(DOORBELL RINGING)

426
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,442
(GROANS SOFTLY)

427
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,626
What the fuck?

428
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,174
Holy shit.

429
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,920
(BOTH GIGGLING)

430
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,676
Hey!

431
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,261
Hi.

432
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,683
What happened?

433
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,435
(STUTTERING)
I don't really remember.

434
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,522
I blame you. How much did you
let him drink last night?

435
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,404
SELENA: Honestly,
not that much.

436
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,783
Well, we gotta clean this up
before we go to the lake.

437
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,036
What? The lake?

438
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,285
Yeah, the lake, dude.
It was your idea.

439
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,000
We discussed
all this last night.

440
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,377
Oh, the lake!
Yes, of course, the...

441
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,755
Hey, Jim, can you hand me
those paper towels, please?

442
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,469
Oh, those paper towels?
The paper ones.

443
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,553
Uh...

444
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,390
The paper towels, Jim.

445
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,471
Jim! Yeah...

446
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,019
The paper towels!

447
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,270
(GASPS)

448
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,478
I'm really sorry.

449
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:20,525
Jim, you do realize that
the lid is see-through, right?

450
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,158
Oh, wow.

451
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,579
Good eye.

452
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,166
That's the father of my child.

453
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,168
(WHOOPING)

454
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,144
Oh, come on!

455
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,722
Hey, watch it! Okay, jeez.

456
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,439
Am I wrong, or was this place a lot
more fun when we were younger?

457
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,775
No, no. I think it's the same.
We're just old now.

458
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,154
But were we just as obnoxious
as these kids back in the day?

459
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,489
No.

460
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,329
Us, our generation,
we were more mature.

461
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,161
Hey, guys, check it out.

462
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,659
Vagina shark!

(SCREAMING)

464
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,584
He touched my snatch!

465
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,833
I take that back.

466
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,260
FINCH: Oh, my God.

467
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,183
Fellas, do you gotta stare?

468
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,346
Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,106
Yes, we do need to stare.

470
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,149
(SCOFFS) Could Jim
be any more obvious?

471
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,735
Oh, give him a break.

472
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,492
I mean, it's not every day you get to see
a model walking around off the page.

473
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,990
There hasn't been
a whole lot of sexy time

474
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,120
in the Levenstein
household lately.

475
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,200
Why not?

476
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,997

638
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,244
It looks like
a high school party.

639
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,532
With high school chicks.

640
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,830
It's on.

641
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,542
Watch it, Stifler. You know these
girls are, like, half your age.

642
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,796
I know.

Okay, is it just me, or do girls
today seem a bit sluttier?

646
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,762
Definitely.

647
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,890
Teen sex, rainbow parties,
sexting nude photos...

648

I saw it all on

Kara. You came!

652
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,361
Hey!

653
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,492
Sorry.

Oh, my God,
is this the babysitter?

657
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,502
Mmm-hmm.

658
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,081
You make it sound like I'm a superhero.

Hey, Jim. Do you wanna
introduce me to your friends?

665
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,259
No.

666
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,017
Girls, this is Stifler.

667
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,940
So, how do you know
my best friend Jim?

668
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,817
Jim used to be my babysitter.

669
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,693
Hey, I was just
gonna do a birthday shot.

670
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,115
Do you guys
wanna do one with me?

671
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,316
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

672
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,400
Yeah. Oh, ye& yes, yes.

673
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,369
I shouldn't.
Yes, we should, yes, we should.

674
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,824
Never have I ever
had sex in public.

675
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,998
Really? None of you?

676
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,792
Oh, come on, Heather.
You haven't drank once.

677
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,506
You are such a prude!

678
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,424
Or maybe I've just
never had sex in public.

679
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:15,764
Okay, never have I
ever been in an orgy.

680
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,274
They were really nice guys.

681
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,153
Believe it or not, this is
my first high school party.

682
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,783
You didn't miss much.

683
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:33,493
I always preferred staying at
home, throwing on a little NPR.

684
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,498
You were so much
cooler than me.

685
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,579
I sat around writing
<i>X-Files</i> fan fiction.

686
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:47,344
I translated The Brothers
Karamazov into Latin for fun.

687
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,173
That is so sexy.

688
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,679
You know it is.

689
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,518
I've only been
working as an architect

690
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,017
for the last few years,
and from home.

691
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,056
You've been with the same
company for over ten years.

692
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,476
That's awesome, it sounds like
everything is working out for you.

693
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,941
Yeah. I mean, everything's
good, especially work-wise.

694
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,523
But now that we're
back here in the town,

695
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,149
and we see, like,
all of our old friends,

696
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,865
and everyone's married
and having kids,

697
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,951
it just makes me,
you know, think.

698
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,286
(COUGHS)

699
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,537
You okay there, Kev?

700
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,208
Yeah, I just don't
normally drink like this.

701
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,418
You're telling me you haven't
gotten a little bit tipsy

702
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,919
on Myers Family Wine Night?

703
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,131
I see somebody's been
stalking my Facebook page.

704
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,672
At least I don't take
pictures of my meals.

705
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,306
Who's stalking who now?

706
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,810
Okay, so I've been by your
page maybe once or twice.

707
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,222
You were dating someone
named Alessandro?

708
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,059
You know, he does know that he can take
a picture with his shirt on, right?

709
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,320
Alessandro is long gone.

710
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,990
It's over, huh?

711
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,238
Okay, after this drink,
I have to go home.

712
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,372
Jim.

713
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:02,294
There's a smoking hot 18-year-old girl
over there that you used to babysit.

714
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,420
And you're not going to
do anything about that?

715
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,673
Need I remind you that
I am married to Michelle?

716
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,749
Exactly.

717
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:13,631
Dude, these young chicks, they know
some crazy shit in the bedroom.

718
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,013
You could take what
you learn from Kara,

719
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,769
bring it home,
and apply it to Michelle.

720
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,098
You do care about your
marriage, don't you, Jim?

721
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,766
What are you talking
about, Stifler?

722
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,022
I'm not gonna cheat on my wife!

723
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,187
I'm a father
for Christ's sakes.

724
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,356
Yeah, that's perfect.

725
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,151
Yeah, chicks love a father figure.
Keep playing that card, dude.

726
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,490
It's not a card,
it's the truth.

727
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,030
Hey. Hi.

728
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,456
What are you guys
talking about?

729
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,784
Oh, you know... Just“

730
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,375
Jim was just saying how much
fun he had taking care of you.

731
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,165
Hey, ladies, why don't we give
them some time to catch up?

732
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,420
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, after you.

733
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,797
No, that's not necessary.
We should all hang out together.

734
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,553
Why don't we all...
Stifler, just...

735

Be her daddy.

736
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,137
Stifler? Stifler!

737
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:05,141
So, sounds like you and Mia have
quite an adventurous lifestyle.

738
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,726
Sometimes a little
too adventurous.

739
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:12,398
Wow. Well, Heather's a bit
more on the conservative side.

740
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,481
But, uh...

741
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,987
Hey! Hi.

742
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,663
But, I gotta be honest, Chris, I
could use a little adventure myself.

743
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,703
What are you getting at, Ron?

744
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:27,588
I'm just saying that usually
I'm not one for swapping,

745
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:33,003
but the fact that you've been with
Heather already, kind of makes it okay.

746
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,588
So, what do you think?

747
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,923
Think they'd be into it?

748
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,723
I'm kidding.
Come on, I'm kidding!

Seriously,
I would never do that!

Unless you guys wanted to.

752
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,854
So you've really been to every
country in South America?

753

No, no, not all of them.

754
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,201
And I don't consider
French Guiana a nation.

755
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,202
I remember, I couldn't
wait till graduation

756
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,288
so I could leave this town
and reinvent myself.

757
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,170
You have certainly
reinvented yourself.

758
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,337
I don't know.

759

There's just a part of me
that still wishes that

760
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,130
I could just explore
the world, you know?

Be everything I set out to be.

You just gotta be it.

Are you crazy?
I love the Twilight books.

on your own dick?

nothing.

01:18:18,743 --> 01:18:21,087
We're here about
that stolen motorcycle.

1597
01:18:21,246 --> 01:18:22,919
Looks like the VIN
numbers match up.

1598
01:18:23,081 --> 01:18:24,333
Paul Finch.

1599
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,251
You're under arrest.

1600
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:28,838
Awesome!

1601
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:30,343
KEVIN: Excuse me, officer.

1602
01:18:30,422 --> 01:18:32,698
He won that bike betting on
the World Cup in Argentina.

1603
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:34,973
You made some sort of mistake.

1604
01:18:35,051 --> 01:18:37,019
Paul, what's going on?
What is this about?

1605
01:18:37,304 --> 01:18:38,476
Paul.

1606
01:18:38,638 --> 01:18:39,935
Finch, just tell them.

1607
01:18:40,098 --> 01:18:41,270
Paul!

1608
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:46,021
STIFLER: Hey, shitbreak, when you're
getting rammed by your cellmate tonight,

1609
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,314
think of Kevin.

1610
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,361
Michelle, can I just... Please!

1611
01:18:57,282 --> 01:18:58,329
Oh!

1612
01:18:59,075 --> 01:19:00,122
Ah!

1613
01:19:00,994 --> 01:19:02,246
Dad? Ah!

(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

1615
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:07,792
Dad?

1616
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,132
Dad, what are you doing?

1617
01:19:10,295 --> 01:19:13,048
You didn't see me!
I'm not here!

1618
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:14,387
I'm not here!

1619
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,139
Is he all right?

1620
01:19:17,802 --> 01:19:19,475
I don't know.

1621
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:21,473
What are we going
to do about Finch?

1622
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,893
Fuck Finch. Let him
spend the night in jail.

1623
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,276
Come on, Stifler!

1624
01:19:25,352 --> 01:19:26,569
Some friend you are.

1625
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:30,365
What about you guys?

1626
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:33,614
You don't call me,
you don't e-mail,

1627
01:19:33,693 --> 01:19:35,821
you don't comment
on my Facebook page.

1628
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:38,202
You guys didn't even let me know you
were coming back for the reunion.

1629
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:41,665
Because we knew, somehow, you would
find a way to screw things up.

1630
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,833
Oh, I'm sorry, Jim.

1631
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:45,588
I wanted us to have
a fucking fun time

1632
01:19:45,664 --> 01:19:47,166
this weekend,
like we did in high school.

1633
01:19:47,332 --> 01:19:49,334
But we're not in
high school any more.

1634
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:51,003
You are so trapped
in the past, Stifler.

1635
01:19:51,169 --> 01:19:54,218
When are you going to realize that things
will never be the way they used to be?

(SCOFFS)

01:20:01,346 --> 01:20:02,563
Fine.

1638
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,563
Guess the party's over.

1639
01:20:07,852 --> 01:20:09,104

Well, that was a great party.

01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:46,767
I honestly think I had fun.

1643
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:51,446
Well, that makes one of us.

1644
01:20:53,773 --> 01:20:55,116
Have you heard from Michelle?

1645
01:20:55,275 --> 01:20:58,529
No. She doesn't
want to talk to me.

1646
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,618
What about the reunion tonight?

1647
01:21:00,697 --> 01:21:02,825
She said she may
or may not come.

1648
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:04,789
What's going on with you two?

1649
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:06,498
Jim, is there anything
you want to talk about?

1650
01:21:07,746 --> 01:21:09,293
(CLEARS THROAT)

1651
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:11,712
Okay.

1652
01:21:12,459 --> 01:21:13,585
Um...

1653
01:21:14,794 --> 01:21:17,388
How often

1654
01:21:17,547 --> 01:21:20,892
did you and Mom...

1655
01:21:24,054 --> 01:21:25,351
You know?

1656
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,524
Is that what this is about?

1657
01:21:27,599 --> 01:21:29,442
You and Michelle
haven't been...

1658
01:21:29,601 --> 01:21:31,444
Not lately, no.

1659
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:32,566
Oh...

1660
01:21:35,106 --> 01:21:36,949
ls it

1661
01:21:37,108 --> 01:21:38,610
an erectile problem?

1662
01:21:39,444 --> 01:21:43,790
Because sometimes you
can buy a little time

1663
01:21:43,948 --> 01:21:45,245
with a well-placed thumb.

1664
01:21:45,325 --> 01:21:47,202
Oh, God. I'm just saying.

1665
01:21:47,285 --> 01:21:49,162
I don't think that's it.
That's not it?

1666
01:21:49,454 --> 01:21:54,255
Oh! That's something to keep in your
back pocket, because that's a no-fail.

1667
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:56,090
Okay, let's be done with that.

1668
01:21:56,252 --> 01:21:59,677
No, things in that
department were fine.

1669
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,976
And then Evan was born

1670
01:22:03,176 --> 01:22:06,055
and we kind of stopped.

1671
01:22:06,304 --> 01:22:10,150
And they haven't really
picked up since, you know?

1672
01:22:10,934 --> 01:22:14,188
This is not a problem,
so do not worry.

1673

You understand?
Yeah, listen, Jim.

1674
01:22:16,314 --> 01:22:17,782
Before you were born,

1675
01:22:17,857 --> 01:22:20,827
your mother and I,
we would do it every day.

1676
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:21,903
I don't need this.

1677
01:22:21,986 --> 01:22:24,330
Sometimes two or
three times a day.

1678
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:28,001
This is back in the '70s.
A lot of experimentation was going on.

1679
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:32,923
Your mother favored something she
called, "diving for dollars."

1680
01:22:33,164 --> 01:22:36,043
Holy shit. I'm sorry,
I don't need...

1681
01:22:36,126 --> 01:22:38,504
(CLEARS THROAT)
That's fine, we can...

1682
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:39,922
I don't have to
go on with that.

1683
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:45,477
But my point is, when you have a
kid, you become a dad and a mom.

1684
01:22:45,844 --> 01:22:50,065
But it's very important not to
stop being a husband and a wife.

1685
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,190
And if you do that,
the sex will come.

1686
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:57,739
That actually
makes a lot of sense.

1687
01:22:57,897 --> 01:23:01,276
But you can't just wait for
the two of you to be alone.

1688
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:04,913
You have to make
your own alone time.

Why do you think you went to
Hebrew school three times a week?

1690
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:12,955

Tuesdays, four to seven?

1691
01:23:13,079 --> 01:23:14,376
Okay, I get it, Dad.

1692
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:16,675

then why the questions?

I should be listening.

What about Michelle?

I am not sure yet.

ALL; Finch!

1713
01:24:12,305 --> 01:24:15,650
What happened? I called the police
department a thousand times.

1714
01:24:15,725 --> 01:24:20,606
I appreciate that, Kevin.
But my mom, actually, bailed me out.

That bike belongs to my boss.

1717

And I was promised a raise,
and I didn't get it, so I

1718
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:31,992
simply borrowed it.

isn't interesting at all.

I lied to my best friends,
and I'm sorry.

1722
01:24:44,671 --> 01:24:47,766
You know, Finch,
just because you sold out

1723
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,844
and got a boring job
like most of us,

1724
01:24:50,927 --> 01:24:52,554
that doesn't mean you
should be embarrassed.

Yeah, come on, man.
None of that shit matters.

01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,949
And you're our dick.

1755
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:37,417
Yeah, man. You were one of the biggest
reasons that high school was awesome.

1756
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:40,249
Yeah, high school was awesome.

1757
01:26:40,411 --> 01:26:43,210
Then we graduated and everybody
started getting jobs

1758
01:26:43,373 --> 01:26:45,592
and getting married
and having kids

1759
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:48,045
and all that other stupid shit.

1760
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:51,886
Now, look at me.
I'm the bitch of this place.

1761
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:54,058
Look, Stifler, none of
our lives are perfect.

1762
01:26:54,217 --> 01:26:55,434
Especially mine.

1763

But what do you say we keep this party
going, and hit up this reunion together?

1764
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,568
What the hell is going on here?

1765
01:27:05,311 --> 01:27:08,815
Oh, my God.
This is the jackass.

1766
01:27:09,232 --> 01:27:11,701
You're not even close to being
finished and you're up here

"chilling with your posse"?

1768
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:15,245
Sorry, we can explain.

1769
01:27:15,405 --> 01:27:16,702
No, Kevin.

1770
01:27:18,116 --> 01:27:19,208
Allow me.

1771
01:27:19,283 --> 01:27:21,911
Yeah, Kevin, allow him.

1772
01:27:21,994 --> 01:27:23,211
This better be good, Stafler.

1773
01:27:23,788 --> 01:27:25,790
It's Stifler, fucker.

1774
01:27:26,124 --> 01:27:30,129
(SCOFFS) Oh, wow.
Who the hell do you think you are?

1775
01:27:30,294 --> 01:27:33,798
Are you acting tough in front
of your girlfriend? Huh?

1776
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,883
Because we both know she's
only with you for your money.

1777
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:38,061
Definitely not for your dick.

1778
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:40,062
Because anybody that's
peed next to you

knows it's the size of

(SNICKERS)

1781
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,560
That's not true.

1782
01:27:45,643 --> 01:27:48,988
(MOCKINGLY) "That's not
true." Oh, yeah, it is.

1783
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:54,320
Look, just because you got a fancy
office and I don't even have a desk

1784
01:27:54,485 --> 01:27:56,783
doesn't change
who we really are.

1785
01:27:56,946 --> 01:28:00,496
The truth is,
you're still a dork,

1786
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:02,581
and I can still kick your ass.

1787
01:28:03,494 --> 01:28:05,167
But I'm not going to.

1788
01:28:05,329 --> 01:28:06,831
You know why?

1789
01:28:06,998 --> 01:28:08,966
Because I'm the
fucking Stifmeister.

1790
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:12,671
And you can take this job and
shove it up your dickhole

1791
01:28:12,837 --> 01:28:14,965
because I have
a reunion to attend.

Dudes?

1793
01:28:22,847 --> 01:28:26,522
By the way, I had no clue what I
was doing with any of this shit,

1794
01:28:26,684 --> 01:28:29,028
so you got a lot of work to do.

Of course.

the Lions this year?

1799

They got a shot?

I actually haven't
thought much about that.

1803
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:18,866
You should think about it.

I'm sorry, guys,
you'll have to excuse me.

Yeah, of course.

because you climbed the Alps,

or killed a camel
with your bare hands.

1860
01:32:14,245 --> 01:32:16,748
I liked you because you were
still the same good guy

01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:19,084
that was actually nice
to me in high school.

was here was for prom.

Come on.
I was a complete jerk last night.

1894
01:33:31,322 --> 01:33:34,201
I was just upset that you would
think that I would do that

1895
01:33:34,366 --> 01:33:35,993
knowing that you're married.

I know you wouldn't.

1897
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:41,965
Honestly, that was more
about me being nervous.

1898
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:47,138
Seeing you again, all these
old feelings came up, and...

I don't know, I guess
I just felt guilty.

1900

But the fact that I still
have feelings for you

1901

just means that what
we had was special.

01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:36,898
I'll be right back, okay?

2072
01:43:40,818 --> 01:43:41,910
Kara!

2073
01:43:48,451 --> 01:43:50,545
HEY-HEY...

2074
01:43:51,329 --> 01:43:54,003
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said the other night.

2075
01:43:54,165 --> 01:43:57,544
No, I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

2076
01:43:57,710 --> 01:43:59,838
I can't believe the way I acted.
I'm so embarrassed.

2077
01:43:59,921 --> 01:44:01,468
Don't be.

2078
01:44:01,881 --> 01:44:05,181
When I was your age I was
pretty obsessed with sex, too.

2079
01:44:05,259 --> 01:44:06,351
I know.

2080
01:44:07,387 --> 01:44:08,479
I've seen the YouTube clip.

2081
01:44:08,971 --> 01:44:11,440
Oh, of course you did.

2082
01:44:11,599 --> 01:44:13,818
But, thanks for understanding.

2083
01:44:13,976 --> 01:44:16,775
I was thinking about it,
and you're right.

2084
01:44:16,938 --> 01:44:18,565
I should really wait
for someone special.

2085
01:44:20,274 --> 01:44:23,278
Just, it's going to be tough
to find a guy as good as you.

2086
01:44:26,698 --> 01:44:27,790
I'm sure you will.

2087
01:44:34,622 --> 01:44:36,716
I feel like a whole new
man after this weekend.

2088
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:38,259
Kind of sucks
we have to leave, though.

2089
01:44:38,334 --> 01:44:41,463
Not me. I'm going to take
some time off my job

2090
01:44:41,546 --> 01:44:43,389
and stick around here
with Heather for a while.

2091
01:44:43,464 --> 01:44:44,556
Nice!

2092
01:44:44,632 --> 01:44:45,758
What about you, Finch?

2093
01:44:45,842 --> 01:44:49,062
Selena and I, we're planning
a little jaunt to Europe.

2094
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:51,814
Just make sure you call your mom.
She misses you.

2095
01:44:52,682 --> 01:44:54,059
How would you know?

2096
01:44:54,434 --> 01:44:55,435
(CHUCKLES)

2097
01:44:55,852 --> 01:44:56,853
Oh...

2098
01:44:59,981 --> 01:45:01,904
I guess this is it, huh?
Back to reality?

2099
01:45:02,066 --> 01:45:03,818
We shouldn't wait
until the next reunion.

2100
01:45:03,985 --> 01:45:07,080
We should try to get
together every year.

2101
01:45:07,196 --> 01:45:09,824
What do you say,
until next time?

2102
01:45:09,907 --> 01:45:12,080
Until next time.
Until next time!

2103
01:45:21,794 --> 01:45:23,091
(MIMICKING COUGH)
I fucked Finch's mom.

2104
01:45:23,212 --> 01:45:24,509
What?

2105
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:25,973
What was that?

2106
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:43,442
(OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

2107
01:46:44,001 --> 01:46:45,753
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)

2108
01:46:48,047 --> 01:46:49,048
Hmm?

2109
01:46:49,715 --> 01:46:51,092
What's this?

2110
01:46:52,426 --> 01:46:54,178
Oh, no, dean No, no, no.

2111
01:46:54,345 --> 01:46:56,188
No, dear. No! (UNZIPPING)

2112
01:46:56,264 --> 01:46:57,265
Oh!

2113
01:47:03,145 --> 01:47:04,146
Oh...

2114
01:47:04,897 --> 01:47:07,946
Oh. Oh. Oh.

2115
01:47:08,192 --> 01:47:11,537
Ah. Oh. Oh.

2116
01:47:11,946 --> 01:47:14,825
Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

2117
01:47:15,032 --> 01:47:17,126
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

2118
01:47:17,785 --> 01:47:19,378
Oh! Oh!

2119
01:47:19,453 --> 01:47:21,501
Oh, my God!

2120
01:47:21,873 --> 01:47:23,295
Ah! (LAUGHING)

2121
01:47:26,085 --> 01:47:27,086
(SIGHS)

2122
01:47:27,503 --> 01:47:29,050
(CLEARS THROAT)

2123
01:47:29,213 --> 01:47:30,806
Great movie.
