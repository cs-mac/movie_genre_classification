1
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,743
<i>Not yet, Cary.</i>

2
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:36,883
<i>Not yet, Cary.</i>

3
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,924
Hmm.

4
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:40,767
- Barnaby, you have the key.
- Ah?

5
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:42,964
Well, look for it, darling.

6
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,973
Hmm.

7
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,834
Look in this first pocket.
That's usually where you hide it.

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,379
Oh, yeah.
Oh, but I didn't hide it.

9
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,177
I put it there so I could find it.
Here it is.

10
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,182
Would you turn on the porch light
and turn off that hall light?

11
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:01,013
Close the door and
be sure that it's locked...

12
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:02,451
and I'll start the car.

13
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,987
I understand.

14
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:32,201
Oh, it's you.
Come on in.

15
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,868
- Barnaby.
- Huh?

16
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:37,845
- We're going to a dance.
- Oh, yes.

17
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,710
And we're going to be late
if we don't hurry.

18
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,874
Oh, yeah.

19
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,349
Now, let's start all over again.
You've got your key.

20
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:46,851
- Mm-hmm.
- No, it's in that pocket.

21
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,945
Oh, that's right.
I put it there on purpose.

22
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:50,715
And you're going
to turn the porch light on...

23
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:53,019
and the hall light off...

24
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:55,184
and then you're going
to lock the door.

25
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,523
- Right.
- Now, come along, darling.

26
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:18,142
- Barnaby, are you thinking?
- Hmm? Hmm?

27
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,405
Oh, yeah, yeah.

28
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,742
It's pretty dark in here,
isn't it?

29
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,415
That's better.

30
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,815
What are you thinking about?

31
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,352
Oh, it's the test
we made in the lab today.

32
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:33,887
They proved that only
23% of the formula...

33
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:35,388
is being assimilated.

34
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:36,889
Oh, the formula.

35
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,515
Yeah. Well, you know
what that means.

36
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:42,390
That-That means that
73% is absolute waste.

37
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,520
Seventy-three?
What happened to the rest of it?

38
00:03:44,597 --> 00:03:47,258
No, no. Not 73, 77.
What did I say?

39
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,892
- Seventy-seven.
- Well.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,968
I guess that's why
it's having so little effect...

41
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,866
on those chimpanzees
we're experimenting with.

42
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:57,871
We've been giving it to them
for over two months now.

43
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:01,807
Well, it certainly hasn't done
what it should have done.

44
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,901
I thought
it was doing rather well.

45
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,308
No, no.

46
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,007
No, that's the trouble.
It isn't doing well at all.

47
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,549
What about that one monkey
you told me about?

48
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,413
- Oh, you mean Rudolph.
- He's pretty old, isn't he?

49
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:16,009
Well, Rudolph's about...

50
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,054
Well, he's about the equivalent
of 84 years old in a human.

51
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:21,613
Well, didn't the formula
cure his rheumatism?

52
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,658
Didn't it make his coat
much glossier?

53
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,920
- Didn't you say he felt a lot better?
- Well, in a way.

54
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:27,985
Well, then,
what do you expect?

55
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:30,029
Well, it isn't what
it should be, Edwina.

56
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:32,065
What must it be before
you're satisfied with it?

57
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,998
Theoretically, it should have
a much greater effect.

58
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,558
I've just got to find a way
to make it more easily assimilable.

59
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,661
- Huh?
- Assimilable? Assi...

60
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:44,867
- More easily assimilated.
- Oh, yeah.

61
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,705
I thought I had a good idea
at the front door just now.

62
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:50,506
I guess I just thought I had it.
Anyway, it's gone.

63
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,013
- Well, it'll come back to you.
- I doubt it.

64
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:54,274
It'll come back to you.

65
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:57,044
That's the trouble
about being a chemist.

66
00:04:57,118 --> 00:04:59,051
You know,
you can't actually think.

67
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,552
Every now and then...

68
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,519
you feel compelled to sit
and stare at a sheet of paper...

69
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:05,056
hoping it'll speak to you,
but it never does.

70
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:10,020
Oh. Is that a new dress?

71
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,526
Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:14,154
Oh, I like that.
Let me see it.

73
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,391
I like the way it sticks out.

74
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:19,331
- Or is that you?
- Well, you ought to know.

75
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,334
It isn't you.

76
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,394
You ought to be going
somewhere in a dress like that.

77
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:29,065
Yeah. Well,
I'm glad you like it.

78
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,109
Holy smokes.

79
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:34,508
We forgot all about the party.
Why didn't you remind me?

80
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:37,138
- We're not going.
- Why not?

81
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,671
Well, we're not going
for a number of reasons.

82
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:41,181
Oh?

83
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,845
One: When I dance with you,
I want to dance with all of you.

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,013
I don't want your brain
to be somewhere else.

85
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,521
I know.

86
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,524
You're not very often
the absent-minded professor...

87
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,991
but, darling, when you are,
you're a real zombie.

88
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,027
Yeah, I admit it.

89
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:57,424
And I don't want people
to see you like that.

90
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,962
Now, go on.

91
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,363
Sit down and relax
and be brilliant.

92
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:05,367
Hey.

93
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:11,802
- You know, you're all right.
- How do you like your eggs?

94
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:13,500
How did eggs get in
to the conversation?

95
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,337
You're hungry, aren't you?

96
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,644
<i>I'll fix you something to eat...</i>

97
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,679
<i>and call Hank and tell him
we're not coming.</i>

98
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,353
- Did you telephone Hank?
- Mm-hmm. He wasn't in.

99
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,948
- I left a message.
- Oh.

100
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:41,459
Don't tell me you've solved
the formula already.

101
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:44,724
No. No, I've had my mind
on other things.

102
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:48,732
You've been looking forward to going
to this party for a month, haven't you?

103
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,825
Now, darling, we're not
even going to discuss it.

104
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:53,096
I know that.
I was just thinking.

105
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:54,729
It's queer about people.

106
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,271
What about people?

107
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,671
Through no fault of their own,
they get older.

108
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:00,732
- Now, that's a profound remark.
- No, they do get older.

109
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:04,778
- Something happens to them.
- Are you referring to me, Barnaby?

110
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:06,780
No, I was thinking of
the human race as a whole.

111
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:08,145
Pretty sad group.

112
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:10,308
Would you get me
some soup plates, darling?

113
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,808
If you don't think
the human race undergoes...

114
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,888
certain morbid changes
as it matures...

115
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:18,946
I ask you to recall the night
of the Everett Winston party.

116
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,251
I don't recall any
Everett Winston party.

117
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,259
Do you remember
our honeymoon?

118
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:26,921
- Of course I do, darling.
- I was hoping you would.

119
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:29,862
Well, the week after we got back
from our honeymoon...

120
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:33,662
the Everett Winstons
invited us to a party.

121
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:35,827
I'm sorry, darling,
but I don't remember going.

122
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,893
We didn't go.

123
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,130
We didn't?

124
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:43,402
Oh, yes.
Now I remember.

125
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:47,410
We stayed home.
Just like tonight.

126
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,968
You know, Edwina,
that's what I'm talking about.

127
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,071
We stayed home from that party
for an altogether different reason.

128
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:55,742
Tonight we're staying home
for an intellectual reason.

129
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,546
I remember we didn't want
to share each other with anyone.

130
00:07:57,652 --> 00:07:59,517
You were so sweet.

131
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:01,349
Remember how the telephone
kept ringing...

132
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:03,390
for hours and hours and hours?

133
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:06,914
<i>Remember?</i>

134
00:08:06,993 --> 00:08:09,222
I'll get it.

135
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:12,126
Aw. You see what I mean?

136
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:14,222
Tonight we're answering calls.

137
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,400
- Hi, Hank.
- Hi.

138
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:22,437
Say, what's this message
about not going out tonight?

139
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:24,437
- That's right.
- Why?

140
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,440
Sometimes there are things
more important than going to a dance.

141
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,975
Oh, the genius
at work again, huh?

142
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,475
I'm glad I'm a lawyer
and not a chemist.

143
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,772
- Where is he?
- He's in the kitchen.

144
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,382
I've got a few things
to say to him.

145
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,505
This has happened
just once too often.

146
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,312
Now, look here, double dome.

147
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:43,012
What's the idea of doing
something tonight...

148
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,020
you can do
just as well tomorrow?

149
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:47,022
I'll get you a drink.
You'll feel better.

150
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,681
Why can't you
be a genius before sundown...

151
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:50,190
and a human being afterward?

152
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:52,623
Because I never know in advance
when I'm going to be a genius.

153
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,127
Here's your drink.

154
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:57,823
You can't call off a date
at the last minute...

155
00:08:57,897 --> 00:09:00,456
when your wife's got a new dress
and I've booked a table.

156
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:02,500
It just doesn't make sense.

157
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,929
No, I don't suppose it does.

158
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:11,130
What are you doing?

159
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,141
Nothing, dear.
I think you'd better sit down.

160
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,472
Huh? What for?

161
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:16,976
Do as I tell you,
and you'll see what I mean.

162
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:18,979
Cold?

163
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,445
I see what you mean.

164
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:22,414
And now neither one of you
are making sense.

165
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:25,383
No. I think
Mr. Entwhistle is disturbed...

166
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:27,384
because he can't take you
to the party tonight...

167
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,420
and dance all over your feet
as he did the last time.

168
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:31,785
I certainly didn't reserve
a table and order flowers...

169
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,517
just to look at your face.

170
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:35,057
I don't suppose you did.

171
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,355
Sit down, have your soup
while Hank drinks his drink.

172
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:40,361
And be careful. It's very hot.
Is it all right now?

173
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,226
I can only tell you,
Mrs. Fulton...

174
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:45,459
if you'd have been smart enough
to marry me instead of this...

175
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,898
you wouldn't be
in a kitchen cooking.

176
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:50,129
No? Where would
she be cooking? Mmm!

177
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,500
<i>- Barnaby, did you burn yourself?
- I hope he did.</i>

178
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:55,165
<i>- Darling, I told you it was hot.
- Don't worry. He has no feelings.</i>

179
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,300
Here, eat some bread. Quickly.
Darling, say something.

180
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,502
- Heat.
- I know. Blow on it.

181
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:04,307
Heat. Just ordinary heat.
I never thought of it.

182
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,779
Heat could make the formula
100% effective.

183
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:08,816
Darling, I think you solved
the problem for me.

184
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,817
- Do you really think so?
- I'm almost sure.

185
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,978
Hank, do you know
what just happened?

186
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,453
He burned his mouth.

187
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,149
No, silly. He just solved
our whole future.

188
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:20,191
If your whole future depends on figuring
out that a plate of soup is hot...

189
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,227
Hey, now, wait a minute.
Tell him, darling.

190
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:24,784
I've been promised a pretty good job
if I can make this formula work.

191
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:26,522
No more commercial assignments.

192
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:30,964
No more working on nonskid girdles
or noiseless popcorn bags.

193
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,024
- No fooling?
- Yes, a roving commission.

194
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:34,728
Select my own field of research.

195
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,828
Exchange ideas with professors all
over the world, including a percentage.

196
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:41,306
That's fine. It seems to me
a celebration is in order.

197
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,899
No reason to stay home
from the yacht club party now.

198
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,934
No. Except we're gonna stay home
from the Everett Winston party.

199
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:51,072
Everett Winston left town
three years ago.

200
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:53,912
We're staying home from his party.

201
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,644
But you can't stay home
from a party if you...

202
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:00,983
- Your phone's ringing.
- Yes, I know.

203
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:04,081
- Shall I answer it?
- No, just let it ring.

204
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:06,125
- That's important, isn't it?
- It's very important.

205
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,990
You two are way beyond me.

206
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:10,358
Please convey our regrets
to the Everett Winstons.

207
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:13,227
And say we're very sorry.

208
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,257
The language is confusing,
but the actions are unmistakable.

209
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,859
Good night, you two.

210
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:34,044
- Just a moment, please.
- Good morning.

211
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:36,582
Oh, Dr. Fulton, Mr. Oxly would like
to see you in his office.

212
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,138
Thank you.

213
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,014
- Good morning, Dr. Fulton.
- Good morning.

214
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,558
<i>Aren't you here early?</i>

215
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,992
Oh, yes. Mr. Oxly's been
complaining about my punctuation.

216
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,926
So I'm careful
to get here before 9:00.

217
00:11:56,631 --> 00:12:00,691
<i>Mr. Oxly's on the telephone.
Won't you sit down?</i>

218
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:02,394
I'm glad we have a moment.

219
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:04,902
I have something
I want to show you.

220
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,029
For instance?

221
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,340
- Isn't it wonderful?
- I beg your pardon?

222
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:14,137
The new non-rip
plastic stockings you invented.

223
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,236
Oh. The N4-1 Acetate Project.

224
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:21,305
This is an experimental pair,
the first pair out of the factory.

225
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:23,782
- Aren't you proud?
- Turned out rather well.

226
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:26,148
I'll say. You can't tear 'em
or snag 'em or anything.

227
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:28,278
- I'm familiar with the product.
- No matter how hard you try.

228
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:31,050
- You'd be amazed, Doctor.
- Oh, no, I wouldn't be amazed.

229
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:33,613
I've done a lot of experimenting
with this kind of thing.

230
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:35,750
Of course, I'm through
with all of that now.

231
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:39,989
Uh, Mr. Oxly. Dr. Fulton's here.

232
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,462
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. You can come in now.

233
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,557
- Thank you.
- If you're not too busy.

234
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:47,500
Well, Miss Laurel
was just showing me her acetates.

235
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:51,595
- Yes. Uh, no calls, please.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,538
- Barnaby, I want to talk to you.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,734
I'm very much interested
in this new experiment of yours.

238
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,971
As a matter of fact,
I'm all steamed up about it.

239
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,739
How's it coming?

240
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,611
Our problem is to increase
the efficiency of the formula.

241
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:06,205
Could be quite a thing,
you know.

242
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,274
I stumbled onto something
last night that may be of help.

243
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:09,817
Well, that's good news.

244
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:11,876
Oh, I wanted you to see
the advertising layout.

245
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:14,079
I want your opinion.

246
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:17,214
We jumped the gun on it a little,
but I thought we'd better be ready.

247
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:21,156
Well... Well, why B-4?

248
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:23,752
B-4, as in,
"before and after."

249
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,956
Emphasizes the youth angle.

250
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:27,464
Get it?

251
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:29,795
Hmph.
What's the vulture doing?

252
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,994
That's a phoenix,
a mythical bird...

253
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,263
rising out of the ashes of age.

254
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:36,271
Makes the youth point again.

255
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,272
Dignified, yet forceful.

256
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,773
Do you mind a comment?

257
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:41,138
Not at all.
I'd welcome it.

258
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,609
- I think it's appalling.
- From what point of view?

259
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,474
Well, it's lurid and inaccurate.

260
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:47,479
It implies that we're going
to offer the public...

261
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:49,309
some sort
of"fountain of youth" drug.

262
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:51,315
But wouldn't it
make people young?

263
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:55,478
Mr. Oxly, we're working
with a large number of ingredients...

264
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:58,783
each of which, as we know,
accomplishes certain beneficial results.

265
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,289
Well?

266
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:03,519
It depends on which combination
of those ingredients we use...

267
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,617
and the proportions
in which we use them.

268
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:08,924
Mathematically, we may never find
the right combination...

269
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,362
or the exact proportions to produce
the effect you're talking about.

270
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:15,663
- It would be a miracle.
- But you can do it, my boy.

271
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:18,532
<i>I told you I didn't want any calls.</i>

272
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:21,071
Mr. Oxly,
Dr. Linten's on the phone.

273
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:23,197
I told him you were busy,
but he says it's very important.

274
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:26,071
- Who is he?
- He's my new assistant.

275
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:29,474
Oh, yes.
Just a moment, Miss Laurel.

276
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:31,570
Find someone to type this.

277
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:35,104
- Oh, Mr. Oxly, can't I try again?
- No, it's very important.

278
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:37,343
Better find someone
to type it for you.

279
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,351
Yes, sir.

280
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:46,690
Anybody can type.

281
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,423
- Who did she say was calling?
- Dr. Linten.

282
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:54,088
Oh, yes.
Yes, Dr. Lintle?

283
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,690
Yes?
I know he's not there.

284
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,893
Dr. Fulton is here with me.

285
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:02,629
Ye... What?

286
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:06,194
Really?
What sort of reactions?

287
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,105
Why, that's amazing!
We'll be right there.

288
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,301
Come along, Barnaby.
You've done better work than you know.

289
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:16,335
- Come along, Miss Laurel. It's amazing.
- What's amazing?

290
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,904
Dr. Whatchamacallit says
one of your monkeys broke loose.

291
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:20,915
We've got to hurry.

292
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:24,418
He's acting very strangely.
Obviously a reaction to your formula.

293
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:25,898
I knew you could do it, Barnaby.
I knew it.

294
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,310
I knew you could do it, Barnaby.
I knew it.

295
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:33,581
Be careful, Mr. Oxly.
The monkey's turned wild.

296
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,661
- Behave yourself.
- What happened, Jerome?

297
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,286
I haven't the slightest idea,
Doctor.

298
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,954
All I know that he's opened
the door of his cage...

299
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,462
and has been acting strangely.

300
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,294
Let go of him, gentlemen.
Let's see him in action.

301
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,129
No telling what
he's liable to do, sir.

302
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,532
Let go of him!

303
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,808
Look at that old chimp,
Miss Laurel.

304
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,777
Eighty-four years old.
Fourteen years older than I am.

305
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,779
- And just look at him.
- I am looking, Mr. Oxly.

306
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,476
This is incredible.

307
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,449
<i>Now, Rudolph, you come down.</i>

308
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:24,191
I don't understand this.
Have you been giving him stimulants?

309
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:27,595
Only the formula.
Only X-57, Doctor.

310
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,760
The test we made yesterday
gave no indication that...

311
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:33,735
Act your age!
What's the matter with you today?

312
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:35,862
<i>- Rudolph, come down here!
- You're not acting like yourself.</i>

313
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,942
This isn't like you.

314
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:41,238
Come on. Come on.

315
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:45,842
Now, come on, Rudolph.
Behave yourself. Come down here.

316
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,971
<i>- That's better.
- What's he doing there?</i>

317
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:50,141
That cage contains
our new female monkey.

318
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,717
By George. By George!

319
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,584
Come here. Mr. Oxly,
haven't you seen enough yet?

320
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,382
Come here.

321
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:02,254
Something's wrong.

322
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,350
Let me see if there's something
I can do with him.

323
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,860
- You're welcome to him.
- Now, Rudolph, you calm down.

324
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:09,590
Come on, Rudolph.
You behave yourself. That's better.

325
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:12,564
Be a good boy. Do as I tell you.
Come on down from there.

326
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,260
Come on. That's good.
Come along. Come along.

327
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,860
All right.

328
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,565
Calm down and sit there.
Let me look at you. Yes.

329
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,665
Well, gentlemen,
I think we've seen enough.

330
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:27,107
I'd like to consult
with Dr. Fulton alone.

331
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:30,305
Barnaby, if your formula
will have the same effect on humans...

332
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:32,005
it's the greatest thing
in modern science.

333
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:33,514
Sit down, Rudolph.

334
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:36,345
We intend to discontinue
every other product in our plant.

335
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:38,577
<i>We'll turn out B-4
and nothing but B-4.</i>

336
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:41,246
<i>I'd like to offer myself
as the first human to try it.</i>

337
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,345
Mr. Oxly,
that may be dangerous.

338
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:46,618
I'm perfectly willing
to take that chance.

339
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:49,660
Oh.
This isn't Rudolph.

340
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:51,752
- What?
- No, no, no.

341
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,831
This chimpanzee
is only six months old.

342
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:56,957
Rudolph is a male.
This is a female.

343
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,261
- Barnaby, are you sure?
- Reasonably.

344
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:01,802
- She's wearing Rudolph's jacket.
- But this is Esther.

345
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:03,302
Here, hold on to Esther,
will you, please?

346
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:04,804
Look, I'll prove it to you.

347
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,533
Now, there's Rudolph
with Esther's number on.

348
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:10,973
I suppose the janitor gave them a bath
and switched jackets by mistake.

349
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:12,977
Yes, well, I suppose
that's the way it happened.

350
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,242
- I certainly feel let down.
- Personally, I'm glad it happened.

351
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:20,374
You're expecting too much
from that formula...

352
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,474
that B-4, Mr. Oxly.

353
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,314
Perhaps it's the name
that's confusing you.

354
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:26,888
If you'll just let me work in
the laboratory for a couple of hours...

355
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:29,150
I'll be better able to prove
what the formula will do.

356
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,689
Let me know when you're ready.

357
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:33,124
And let's have no more
of these false alarms.

358
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:35,161
They certainly
take it out of a man.

359
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,229
Come along, Miss Laurel.

360
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,764
What a ridiculous way
to start a day.

361
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:42,765
I hope it doesn't get any worse.

362
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,339
Sodium ascipate.

363
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:58,344
3,000 milligrams.

364
00:18:58,446 --> 00:19:00,437
<i>Check.</i>

365
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:03,311
You keep quiet, Esther.

366
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,365
<i>- Ooh!
- Don't you like the way I'm doing this?</i>

367
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,905
Ooh-ooh.

368
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:52,385
- Molybdenum.
- Ah.

369
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:54,386
- Sodium molybdate.
- Yeah.

370
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:56,388
Let's see.
Four-tenths each dose.

371
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,150
Three doses would be
1,200 milligrams, right?

372
00:19:58,257 --> 00:19:59,747
Check.

373
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,587
Papain.

374
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:05,924
Two thousand milligrams
for the whole three doses?

375
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,553
Check.

376
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,024
Well, that about does it.

377
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:15,160
Now, Jerome, we will refrigerate
these factors and heat these.

378
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,898
These remain as is. We'll use
Dr. Miller's cooler and incubator.

379
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:21,031
Shall we label this
X-57 as usual?

380
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:23,666
No, X-58, and not B-4.

381
00:20:23,776 --> 00:20:26,141
- Good morning.
- Oh, Gus.

382
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:28,440
Did the monkeys
take a bath this morning?

383
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:30,639
Why?
Is there one missing?

384
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,340
- No, no, Gus.
- Yes?

385
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,110
Did you bathe
the monkeys this morning?

386
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:35,617
Yes, of course. Sure.

387
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:38,118
- Well, you mixed up their uniforms.
- Oh, I did?

388
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:40,747
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, Doctor.
I'll fix them up right away.

389
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:43,415
You can do it when you
feed them this afternoon.

390
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,424
- But don't let it happen again.
- No, sir, I won't.

391
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,118
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.</i>

392
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:48,627
Oh, quiet down.

393
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:51,196
You've caused me
enough trouble already.

394
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:55,790
Heh! Grown-up men
playing with monkeys.

395
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:58,027
Mice, rabbits, guinea pigs.

396
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:00,103
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Now monkeys.

397
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,425
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Whew!

398
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,261
What's the matter?

399
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,301
Oh, my bursitis.

400
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:30,700
Well, that's one of the things
I hope the formula will alleviate.

401
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:33,329
- You intend to take it yourself?
- Certainly I do.

402
00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:36,270
- Why not try it on Jerome?
- I wouldn't dare try it on Jerome.

403
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,434
You remember what happened
with the hair restorer?

404
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:40,875
Yes. One of our more
successful experiments.

405
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:43,345
Well, we learned
how to remove hair, anyway.

406
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:45,345
Let's talk about something else.

407
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,368
Hey, hey, hey.
How did you get out of there?

408
00:23:56,468 --> 00:24:00,597
Huh? Listen, Esther or Rudolph,
whichever one you are.

409
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:04,732
Come on. You get
right back in your cage.

410
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:07,036
No, I'm not gonna
carry you. You walk.

411
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,772
Come on. What did you do,
getting out? Get back in.

412
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:13,439
Go on.
How'd you get out, anyway?

413
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:21,145
Gus. I thought you were
going to attend to that later.

414
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,847
Oh, I wasn't
changin' 'em, Doctor.

415
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,254
Esther got out,
and I was putting her back in her cage.

416
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:29,122
Oh, I guess that was my fault.
I forgot to close the lock.

417
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,150
Kinda messed
your stuff up there.

418
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,354
- I'll take care of it, Gus.
- All right.

419
00:24:36,765 --> 00:24:38,857
Oh, don't bother with
anything now, Jerome.

420
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:41,128
I'm anxious to try this.

421
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:43,863
Seriously, Doctor,
you think you should take it?

422
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:47,235
Self-experimentation is against
the rules of all good research.

423
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,433
Jerome, the history of discovery...

424
00:24:49,508 --> 00:24:52,874
is the history of people
who didn't follow rules.

425
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:54,877
Well, here goes.

426
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:57,743
To X-58
and a better world.

427
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:04,881
Mmm!
Gosh, that's bitter.

428
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,920
I've got to get some water.

429
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,656
Oh, that Gus.

430
00:25:14,194 --> 00:25:16,127
Hmm.

431
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,728
Oh, it even makes
the water taste bitter.

432
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:26,901
Well, better put these away.

433
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:29,437
Theoretically, Doctor,
what might be the first reaction?

434
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:32,438
- I haven't the vaguest idea.
- What about the lag of time?

435
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:34,440
Depends upon
the period of absorption.

436
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:36,942
It's quite possible that...

437
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,806
Hmm, touch of dizziness.

438
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:40,869
And you have a slight flush.

439
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,710
That's probably due
to my natural excitement.

440
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:46,943
Hmm. Around 150.

441
00:25:47,017 --> 00:25:48,678
Well, that's odd.

442
00:25:48,753 --> 00:25:50,913
There's nothing in the mixture
that could accelerate the heart.

443
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:53,854
And you feel dizzy,
you said?

444
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,947
As a matter of fact,
I believe it's increasing.

445
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:58,617
Well, I'd better
record my reactions.

446
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,020
Pulse: 150.
Is that right?

447
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:07,122
One-fifty.

448
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,201
Mounting vertigo.

449
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:13,031
No nausea.

450
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,300
A sensation not unlike...

451
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,242
a series of small
electric shocks.

452
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:31,106
- Jerome, Jerome, where are you?
- I'm here.

453
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:33,778
- What is it?
- I can't see. I'm blind.

454
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:35,979
- Please, go on with the notes.
- No, this is too serious.

455
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,453
Do as I tell you. There isn't time.
I know what I took.

456
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:40,491
If there's an antidote,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

457
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,048
Now, just take the notes.

458
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:47,255
It is like a cloud,
a very peculiar feeling.

459
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:49,796
General milkiness,
but no discomfort.

460
00:26:49,864 --> 00:26:53,630
In fact, it's a sensation
of extreme well-being.

461
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,634
It's as if I...

462
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,937
Doctor, what is it?

463
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:01,506
A paralysis?
Can you speak?

464
00:27:01,606 --> 00:27:04,632
Try tapping once for yes,
two for no.

465
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:08,176
Can you hear me?
Doctor, can you hear me?

466
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,247
Perfectly. Hand me
the telephone book, please.

467
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:14,008
- Whose number do you want?
- Let me have the book.

468
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,378
Inglewood.
Drop Forge and Tool Company.

469
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:25,117
1065 West Hauser Avenue...

470
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:27,990
Inglewood West 60945.

471
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,619
It isn't possible.

472
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:32,162
It is possible, Jerome.

473
00:27:32,263 --> 00:27:34,355
For the first time
in ten years...

474
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:36,365
I am able to see
without my glasses.

475
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:38,423
- Perfect vision.
- I can't believe it.

476
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:42,299
There. Now I'm blind again.
Fog, you see?

477
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,894
Now I can see again.

478
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:46,404
Doctor, X-58
seems to be a success.

479
00:27:46,474 --> 00:27:48,408
Oh, indeed it does.

480
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:50,705
- I'll try my bursitis.
- Ooh!

481
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,675
Oh, I beg your pardon.

482
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:57,613
Not a twinge!

483
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,149
This is amazing.

484
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,116
Dr. Barnaby Fulton,
let me shake hands...

485
00:28:02,152 --> 00:28:03,585
<i>with the next Nobel Prize winner.</i>

486
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:05,210
<i>Delighted!</i>

487
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:07,551
Pardon me.
My phone's running over.

488
00:28:07,623 --> 00:28:09,487
Hello, Department of Water
and Power.

489
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,024
Which one would
you care to have cut off?

490
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:13,423
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Hello!</i>

491
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:16,463
Oh, Barnaby, you sound as if
the formula was a success.

492
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,996
Did it go well?

493
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:21,032
Anybody giving a party
we can stay home from again tonight?

494
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,964
<i>Oh, Barnaby.
No one I know of.</i>

495
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,433
Oh, what a shame.

496
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,732
Then pour yourself into
that new dress, and we'll go celebrate.

497
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,236
<i>All right. I'll be ready.</i>

498
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:30,431
<i>But don't forget
what you have to do.</i>

499
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:32,668
<i>- First, get a haircut.
- Haircut, yeah.</i>

500
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:35,335
<i>- And get a new suit.
- New suit, yeah.</i>

501
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,378
Oh, and, darling,
stop by the automobile agency.

502
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:41,572
Mr. Peabody just called
and says he has a very good buy.

503
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:44,481
A good buy, eh?
Well, good-bye to you.

504
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:47,519
Oh, what a joke.
A real knee-slapper.

505
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,109
You do feel all right?

506
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:50,620
I'll get it.

507
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,019
Hello, Griffith Park Zoo.
Snake Department.

508
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,285
<i>- Hello, hello. What is this?
- What do you want?</i>

509
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,791
This is Mr. Oxly.

510
00:28:56,893 --> 00:28:57,985
I'll see if he's here.

511
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,028
<i>- No, I said, this is Oxly.
- Who is?</i>

512
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:02,188
<i>- I am, speaking.
- Oh, you're Mr. Speaking.</i>

513
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:03,993
<i>This is Mr. Oxly speaking.</i>

514
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:06,430
Oxly Speaking.
Any relation to Oxly?

515
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,990
<i>- Barnaby Fulton, is that you?
- Who's calling?</i>

516
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:09,500
I am, Barnaby!

517
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:12,367
You're not Barnaby. I'm Barnaby.
I ought to know who I am.

518
00:29:12,437 --> 00:29:15,600
<i>- This is Oxly speaking, Barnaby!
- Well, now, that's ridiculous.</i>

519
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:18,437
You can't be all three. Figure out
which one you are and call me back.

520
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,499
And I'm coming
right down there!

521
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,101
Coming right down...
all three of him.

522
00:29:23,146 --> 00:29:25,579
What will you do?
What will you tell him?

523
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:26,979
- I won't be here.
- Where are you going?

524
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,414
- I've got things to do.
- What?

525
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:30,781
I've got to get my hair cut
and a new suit and car.

526
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,944
But Mr. Oxly will be furious.
What shall I tell him?

527
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:34,987
Just tell him the truth...
you don't know who he is.

528
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:36,453
I can't say that.

529
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:39,013
- Just keep your Bunsen burning.
- But, Doctor...

530
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,287
Where's Dr. Fulton?
I want to see him.

531
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,759
- He just left.
- I didn't pass him in the hall.

532
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:46,819
- He went through the window.
- Through the window?

533
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:48,954
What's this all about?
What's happened to the man?

534
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:52,295
He took some of the formula
and went out of here acting as though...

535
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:55,131
No, exactly as though
he were 20 years old.

536
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:57,670
By George. By George.
Do you know where he went?

537
00:29:57,772 --> 00:29:59,205
- Yes, sir.
- Hello. Get me Miss...

538
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:01,206
Hello.
Get me Miss Laurel, quick.

539
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:03,469
- Where did he go?
- To buy a new automobile, sir.

540
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:05,635
- What kind of car does he drive?
- A Ford.

541
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:08,679
Hello, Miss Laurel.
Now, listen carefully.

542
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,749
I want you to go to
every Ford agency in town...

543
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,784
and find Dr. Fulton.

544
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:17,215
But, Mr. Oxly,
what shall I do first?

545
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:20,614
He'll be at the agencies.

546
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:22,782
To find him,
you'll have to go there.

547
00:30:22,857 --> 00:30:26,348
<i>- Oh, I see, Mr. Oxly.
- And bring him back here.</i>

548
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:28,360
Yes, sir.
Right away.

549
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,226
Well, Doctor, I cut it
the way you wanted me to.

550
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,799
- I hope Mrs. Fulton likes it.
- She will.

551
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,736
- What do you think?
- It fits rather well.

552
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,004
But are you sure
it's what you want, Dr. Fulton?

553
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:53,410
Tell me, do they ever
wear trousers to match?

554
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,505
Oh, very seldom.
Usually gray flannels.

555
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:58,049
I see.

556
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:00,641
Oh! These socks
ought to go well with it.

557
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,259
To be honest with you,
Dr. Fulton...

558
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,918
I don't think
either you or Mrs. Fulton...

559
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:15,587
are going to be happy
with this type of car.

560
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,688
It isn't exactly
what you had in mind.

561
00:31:17,765 --> 00:31:20,392
Yeah, well, you're perfectly right.
Let's take off the fenders.

562
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,867
I'm sorry, we can't do that, Doctor.
It's against the state law.

563
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:25,596
Oh, it's too bad.

564
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,434
You don't happen to have
a beaver tail around, do you? L...

565
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,503
Hello, Miss Laurel.

566
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:36,505
Oh, hello, Dr. Fulton.

567
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:38,444
Hi!

568
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:41,004
Hi.

569
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,709
I'm so glad I found you.

570
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:44,614
No, I found you.
Pick a finger.

571
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,414
Dr. Fulton!

572
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,886
Oh, you know that one.
Oh, what a pity.

573
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:51,649
Mr. Oxly sent me.
He wants to see you right away.

574
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,851
Oh, well, hop in the bus.
I'll get you there in a hurry.

575
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,620
- Is this your car?
- Sure.

576
00:31:56,694 --> 00:31:59,753
- Gee, it's a honey.
- It takes one to know one.

577
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,194
Oh, Mr. Peabody...

578
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:03,458
will you get that suit box
out of my old car, please?

579
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:07,964
Well, all set?

580
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:09,969
- Is your motor running?
- Is yours?

581
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,537
Here you are, Doctor.

582
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,937
Thank you, Mr. Peabody.
Just mail me the bill.

583
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,133
<i>- Certainly.
- Takes a while to warm up.</i>

584
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:18,142
It does me too.

585
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,769
Well, watch your head.
I'll watch everything else. Hoo!

586
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:32,076
Oh, Dr. Fulton,
this is fun.

587
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,179
What about Mr. Oxly?
The plant's back that way.

588
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:36,246
I know. We're going
to circle the field.

589
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,450
So fasten your safety belt
and no smoking.

590
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,286
- Oh, Doctor!
- Look and see if the flaps are down.

591
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:42,831
Well, Doc, she'll be
good as new by 5:00.

592
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:46,238
5:00? Oh, we can do
lots of things by then.

593
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:48,641
- Can't we?
- Sure, Doc.

594
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:55,779
- Come along.
- Do you skate much, Doc?

595
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,545
Not lately. But don't worry.
I'll show you how.

596
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:04,583
Look out, Doc!

597
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:08,448
Careful!

598
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:10,550
Oh, I'm all right.
I'll get the hang of it soon.

599
00:34:10,627 --> 00:34:13,528
I'm gonna be good. You wait.
Oh, my God! Whoa!

600
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,904
Doc, that's awful high.

601
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:28,372
Oh, no, not for me.
Well, everybody looking at me?

602
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:50,952
- How about some music?
- I'd love it.

603
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:54,522
You sure know how
to have a good time.

604
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,686
You know something?
I used to think you didn't like me.

605
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,491
- Just a minute.
- Do you like me a little?

606
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,623
- Just a minute.
- Well, say so.

607
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:06,361
- I like you.
- I'm crazy about you, Doc.

608
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:08,164
Oh, no, no. Wait.
Listen to this.

609
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,604
- Oh, that's dull...
- Don't you dare turn that off.

610
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:15,107
- That's our favorite song.
- Ours?

611
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:17,302
- Yeah. Edwina's and mine.
- Edwina?

612
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:19,311
- My wife.
- Oh.

613
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:25,549
# Gentlemen songsters
off on a spree #

614
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:29,017
- # Dewdrop #
- It sounds like a silly song to me.

615
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,053
Why must you say that?

616
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,520
In my opinion,
it's a silly song.

617
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,456
In my opinion, your opinion that
it's a silly song is a silly opinion.

618
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:39,186
Oh!

619
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:50,663
- Is it getting dark?
- No, not particularly.

620
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:52,134
What's the matter?

621
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,864
Must be something
wrong with my eyes.

622
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:56,997
Is there anything
I can do, Doctor?

623
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:59,098
No, no, no.
It's just, I can't see very well.

624
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:01,972
- Please don't be angry with me.
- Oh, I'm not angry.

625
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,977
Because I would...

626
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,244
Why did you yell?

627
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:11,977
Because...

628
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:14,781
Nothing.

629
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:16,980
- Don't be mad at me.
- Oh, I'm not mad.

630
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,920
Tell me, is the plant
along here somewhere?

631
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,423
Yes.

632
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:22,617
Would you please tell me
where to turn?

633
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:25,092
Turn right.
Now.

634
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,498
- Turn, Doctor, turn!
- Now?

635
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,692
Yes, turn! Turn!

636
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:39,369
- Doctor!
- Are you all right, Miss Laurel?

637
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:41,496
- I told you to turn.
- Yes, yes, I know.

638
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:45,235
I'm terribly sorry,
but I'm afraid I can't see.

639
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:48,106
Would you be good enough
to park the car for me, please?

640
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:50,544
- Sure, I will.
- Thank you.

641
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,315
Hello, Mrs. Fulton.

642
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,815
Good evening, Joe.
Thanks for calling me.

643
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:58,613
- Is the doctor in his office?
- Yes, ma'am.

644
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,346
When I went to tell him
you were coming, he'd gone to sleep...

645
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:02,081
so I didn't wake him up.

646
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:04,452
Does Mr. Oxly know
that the doctor's come back?

647
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:05,956
Yes, ma'am.
He said he'd be down.

648
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,525
Thank you, Joe.

649
00:37:34,613 --> 00:37:36,512
Mmm?
Who is it?

650
00:37:36,614 --> 00:37:38,013
It's me, darling.

651
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:41,084
Oh, hello, Edwina.
I can't see you.

652
00:37:41,184 --> 00:37:43,652
- Where are your glasses?
- Let me think.

653
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:46,483
I left them in the lab.
Jerome probably put them someplace.

654
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:49,386
I'll find them for you.
Oh, here they are.

655
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:53,392
- Whew!
- Barnaby.

656
00:37:53,494 --> 00:37:55,689
Are you sure you're
all right? Here.

657
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:58,958
Oh. I'm just a little fuzzy.
What time is it?

658
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:00,929
It's almost 8:00.

659
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:02,933
Oh, no.
It's that late?

660
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:06,197
Oh, I've done it again.
We were going out for dinner.

661
00:38:06,304 --> 00:38:09,670
I've already had dinner,
but I've brought some for you.

662
00:38:09,773 --> 00:38:12,036
Edwina, I'm terribly sorry.
I wouldn't have...

663
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:14,974
I know you wouldn't
have, darling.

664
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:17,169
- Where did you get the poodle?
- Poodle?

665
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:19,178
Don't tell me
I bought a poodle.

666
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,612
- The haircut.
- Oh, yeah, that, that. Oh, yeah.

667
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:25,240
That's quite a jacket
you bought too.

668
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:26,784
Yeah, I know.

669
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:28,944
Wait till you see
the car I got.

670
00:38:29,054 --> 00:38:32,420
- No, what kind?
- You'll see it soon enough.

671
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:35,083
Darling, you were a real idiot to try
the formula on yourself.

672
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:37,159
- Something could have happened.
- Oh, it did.

673
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:39,420
I mean, something serious.
Here, have some coffee.

674
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:43,259
Thank you. Oh. Oh, I strained
every muscle in my body.

675
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,956
Roller-skating.

676
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:46,624
Don't tell me you
went roller-skating.

677
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:48,132
I'm afraid I did.

678
00:38:48,234 --> 00:38:51,135
And your face is breaking out
with red blotches.

679
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:53,796
Oh, they're not blotches, dear.
That's lipstick.

680
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:55,805
Oh.

681
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:58,808
Yeah. Edwina, what I have to tell you
is unbelievable.

682
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,310
Yes, it is unbelievable
on roller-skates. Hmm, what balance.

683
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:04,572
Well, I wasn't
on roller-skates all afternoon.

684
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,079
Obviously.

685
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:07,637
No. You'll never
believe what I did.

686
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:09,649
- I broke records.
- Huh?

687
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:11,650
You'd have been amazed.
I wish you could've been there.

688
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:13,913
I wish I had been too.

689
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,113
I did things that
I never dreamed I'd do.

690
00:39:16,155 --> 00:39:18,055
You know,
I tried to swan-dive.

691
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:20,420
I missed.

692
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,049
Well, no wonder
you're worn out.

693
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,322
Barnaby, all of this
is very confusing.

694
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,091
- What about the formula?
- That's what I was telling you about.

695
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,328
- Oh. Oh!
- I'll start at the beginning.

696
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:35,595
At 11:52 this morning...

697
00:39:35,703 --> 00:39:38,194
I took a dose of the formula,
and in a few minutes...

698
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:40,773
I began to behave exactly
like a college boy...

699
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:43,467
with 20/20 vision
and no bursitis.

700
00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:45,100
And plenty of lipstick.

701
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:47,303
Uh... Well, the formula
had nothing to do with that.

702
00:39:47,412 --> 00:39:49,710
I'll get to that later.

703
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:52,646
Edwina, we've
discovered something...

704
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,116
that the human race has been searching
for since the beginning of time.

705
00:39:56,152 --> 00:39:58,416
Are you really serious, Barnaby?
It works?

706
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:00,020
Well, it did on me.

707
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:01,851
Of course, I can't
explain the reactions.

708
00:40:01,957 --> 00:40:04,186
It seems to work on the mind.

709
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:07,088
Edwina, imagine:
People never aging.

710
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,118
It sounds frightening.
You mean, it really does that?

711
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,790
Well... Of course,
I don't know half of what it'll do.

712
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,696
The dose I took
has already worn off.

713
00:40:16,801 --> 00:40:20,065
Let's see,
that was eight hours.

714
00:40:20,137 --> 00:40:22,730
Oh. Probably,
the dose was wrong.

715
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,931
- Well, we'll see.
- Hey, where are you going?

716
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,940
I'm going to try
the experiment again...

717
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:28,475
but this time
with a larger dose.

718
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,077
Huh? Oh!

719
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:35,307
Switch on the light,
will you, please, dear?

720
00:40:40,252 --> 00:40:42,845
Barnaby.

721
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:44,443
Must you make
another test?

722
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:46,452
Oh, probably several.

723
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:48,955
I'm glad you're here to see
that nothing goes wrong this time.

724
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:51,925
I want you to observe
and make notes of everything I do.

725
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:54,790
<i>Knowing me so well,
you'll be able to interpret...</i>

726
00:40:54,896 --> 00:40:57,387
<i>the exact meaning
of my behavior pattern.</i>

727
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:01,123
Don't you think you ought to
change that coat...

728
00:41:01,234 --> 00:41:04,430
and wipe that stuff off your face
before you try it again?

729
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:07,562
- Oh, yes. Perhaps you're right.
- Whose lipstick is it?

730
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:10,231
Uh, what's-her-name's...
you know, Oxly's secretary.

731
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,798
Oh. You mean,
that little pinup girl?

732
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:18,005
<i>- Very cute.
- Sort of, but half infant.</i>

733
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:19,478
Not the half that's visible.

734
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:21,741
Well, she's not my type.

735
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:25,946
Barnaby, how much
of this stuff are you going to take?

736
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:28,213
<i>Just what I've poured out there.
I've increased the dose.</i>

737
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:30,982
<i>See, that way, I'll be...</i>

738
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,217
<i>Edwina, what are you doing?</i>

739
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,126
What did you do that for?

740
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,489
'Cause this is
the way it should be.

741
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:41,257
After all, you're the scientist,
and you should do the observing.

742
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,797
- But...
- Don't argue.

743
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:44,662
Go get your notebook.
I've done it.

744
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:46,324
Oh, it tastes bitter.
Get me some water.

745
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,369
Oh, now, really, Edwina.
For heaven's sake.

746
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:49,902
Besides,
according to your story...

747
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,633
you weren't exactly
100% scientist after you took it.

748
00:41:53,706 --> 00:41:55,640
Other things became
much more interesting.

749
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,175
Perhaps you're right.

750
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:01,244
Oh. Even the water
tastes bitter.

751
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:03,246
It did to me too.

752
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,547
Barnaby,
I'm a little bit frightened.

753
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:14,212
- I'm here, dear.
- It's kind of silly, isn't it?

754
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:16,222
I'll take care of you.

755
00:42:17,258 --> 00:42:19,088
I don't feel anything.

756
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:22,288
- Is it supposed to work right away?
- Just a few moments.

757
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:26,087
Would you
clean off your face?

758
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:29,566
Because if I get ten years younger
and see that lipstick...

759
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:31,566
I'm liable to knock
somebody's block off.

760
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:33,567
Yes, dear.

761
00:42:33,669 --> 00:42:36,194
Barnaby, is it true
about B-4?

762
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:39,206
I've just heard the most fantastic
things about you. Does it work?

763
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:42,106
You'll have a chance to judge
for yourself quite soon, Mr. Oxly.

764
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,907
My wife just took
50 CCs of the formula.

765
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,776
Really?
By George, by George.

766
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:49,575
Dr. Brunner and Miss Laurel
are on their way.

767
00:42:49,681 --> 00:42:51,740
Leave word they are
to come here immediately.

768
00:42:51,817 --> 00:42:55,912
Mrs. Fulton, it's very kind of you
to lend yourself to this experiment.

769
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:58,113
Thank you, Mr. Oxly.

770
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:09,152
Well, we have to watch
your reactions, darling.

771
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,489
Yes, I suppose so.

772
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:17,660
Now I know how
a poor little guinea pig must feel.

773
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:27,838
- May I sit down?
- Yes, dear.

774
00:43:30,112 --> 00:43:32,978
Don't just stand there.
Do something.

775
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:34,981
Yes, dear.

776
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:43,888
Mmm.

777
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:47,118
Pulse around 150,
just the same as mine was.

778
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,260
There doesn't seem
to be any fever.

779
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,262
Outside of being somewhat embarrassed,
I feel exceedingly well.

780
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,593
What reaction do you
expect, Barnaby?

781
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:58,098
I don't quite know.

782
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,066
I suppose it depends
upon the individual.

783
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:02,500
With you, it took the form
of thinking as though you were 20.

784
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,197
Oh, it's true.
Keep still, Edwina.

785
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:07,535
What was Mrs. Fulton like
at that age?

786
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:09,699
Huh?

787
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:12,242
Well, Edwina was a very
serious-minded student.

788
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:15,473
She majored in economics...

789
00:44:15,546 --> 00:44:18,241
and took several summer courses
in ichthyology and cooking.

790
00:44:18,315 --> 00:44:20,714
- Ichthyology?
- Mmm, the study of fish.

791
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:23,011
Jerome said your first symptom
was your eyes.

792
00:44:23,085 --> 00:44:25,109
Your vision became perfect.

793
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:27,416
True, but you can't
count upon that.

794
00:44:27,488 --> 00:44:29,614
See, Edwina's vision
is already perfect.

795
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,487
It will probably take
an entirely different form.

796
00:44:32,558 --> 00:44:34,583
My dear, do you feel
anything strange?

797
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,026
Not a thing.
How about you, Mr. Oxly?

798
00:44:38,096 --> 00:44:40,064
Oh, but I haven't
taken anything.

799
00:44:40,098 --> 00:44:42,531
Oh, yes, you have,
Mr. Oxly.

800
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,227
Hear that, Barnaby?
A rather odd reaction.

801
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:47,633
Undoubtedly, we can expect
something soon.

802
00:44:47,704 --> 00:44:50,604
- We certainly can.
- She's sitting very still.

803
00:44:50,672 --> 00:44:52,605
Is it possible there's not
enough movement?

804
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:54,334
If there isn't,
there soon will be.

805
00:44:54,408 --> 00:44:56,637
I can hardly wait for the results.

806
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,735
This is quite a moment.

807
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:02,975
That's it, Oxly!
Watch him, Barnaby! It's working!

808
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:04,514
It's working. You hear
what she said, Barnaby?

809
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:06,049
It's taking effect.

810
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:08,051
- Something wrong, Barnaby.
- What's the matter, sir?

811
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:09,518
I don't know.

812
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:11,349
Perhaps the excitement's
been too much for you.

813
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:15,856
Perhaps you ought to sit down, Mr. Oxly.
Calm yourself, Mr. Oxly.

814
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,222
Now, take your time,
Mr. Oxly.

815
00:45:18,293 --> 00:45:22,058
That's better.
Take your time and sit down.

816
00:45:23,197 --> 00:45:24,629
Oh, my.

817
00:45:24,697 --> 00:45:27,029
# Oh, my
Give me a piece of pie #

818
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,363
# E-I
Give me a piece of pie #

819
00:45:29,434 --> 00:45:31,595
- We ought to go now.
- # E-I, give me a piece of pie #

820
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,967
- We ought to go. Yes.
- # E-I, give me a piece of pie #

821
00:45:34,038 --> 00:45:36,699
- Barnaby, what are you doing?
- I'll be right back.

822
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:38,899
# E-I
Give me a piece... ##

823
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:40,839
Hi, Dr. Fulton.

824
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:43,275
- Hi.
- What did you say to her?

825
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:46,211
Mrs. Fulton, he said "hi."

826
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:49,613
I heard what he said,
you peroxide kissing bug.

827
00:45:49,683 --> 00:45:52,014
Edwina, she hasn't
done anything.

828
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:55,212
I'll pull that blonde hair
out by its black roots.

829
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:57,515
Edwina, now come along.
Miss Laurel, keep out of the way.

830
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,556
- Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
- Edwina, now stop it.

831
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,353
- Mr. Oxly, I'll be right back.
- Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

832
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,892
Wasn't that fun?

833
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,621
Did ya see him jump?
I put a fish in his trousers.

834
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:07,787
- Let's go back and have more fun.
- I don't think we'd better.

835
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:09,955
- Why not? Where are we going?
- Anywhere.

836
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:11,965
- Let's go dancing.
- Edwina...

837
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:14,501
All right, we'll go dancing.
Anything you say.

838
00:46:14,568 --> 00:46:16,831
Oh, is this our new car?

839
00:46:16,936 --> 00:46:19,131
- I'm afraid it is.
- Hey, that's super-duper.

840
00:46:19,205 --> 00:46:21,638
- Oh, you like it?
- Oh, boy, yes!

841
00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:24,197
Hey, why don't you let me drive.
You get over there, huh?

842
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:25,708
I know.

843
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:28,074
We'll go dancing
at the Pickwick Arms.

844
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:29,544
Pickwick Arms?

845
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:31,080
Yeah, that's in La Jolla.
Don't you remember?

846
00:46:31,114 --> 00:46:32,546
Of course I remember.

847
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:34,845
Room 304, where we
spent our honeymoon.

848
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:38,542
All that way?

849
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,780
Yeah, we'll stop by the house
and get some things.

850
00:46:40,888 --> 00:46:44,550
- Won't it be fun?
- Just to go dancing?

851
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:47,217
Edwina, I put the bags
in the car.

852
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:49,783
We can keep your coat
on the...

853
00:46:49,895 --> 00:46:52,988
Barnaby, do you think
this is too conservative?

854
00:46:53,064 --> 00:46:54,997
- Well, I...
- What do you think?

855
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:56,464
- Well, I...
- Say something.

856
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:58,000
- Well, I...
- Glad you like it.

857
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,364
I'm gonna drive.
You're too slow.

858
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:02,871
How do you work this?
Oh, yes. Like that.

859
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:12,207
Oh, Barney, it's gonna be
our honeymoon night all over again.

860
00:47:12,278 --> 00:47:14,769
- With no hands!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
00:47:14,846 --> 00:47:16,507
Honeymoon with no hands.
Yeah. Sure.

862
00:47:16,581 --> 00:47:18,173
Aren't you excited?

863
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:21,740
Yes, of course, dear,
but there's no hurry about it.

864
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:24,651
Wouldn't you like to slow down
so that we can talk?

865
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:26,847
Who wants to talk?

866
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:29,515
Well, Edwina,
I have to test your reactions.

867
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:32,081
Oh, Barney!

868
00:47:32,126 --> 00:47:34,287
Oh, it's wonderful to have
the wind in your hair...

869
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:37,125
and watch
the moon and the stars...

870
00:47:37,197 --> 00:47:39,494
- And the road!
- Oh, the road.

871
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:56,475
Evening, sir.

872
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:58,602
- Oh, good evening.
- Would you like to register?

873
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,738
Yes, please.

874
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:07,183
Do you have a small suite
overlooking the ocean, please?

875
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,584
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Thank you.

876
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:12,247
- Psst! Psst!
- I beg your pardon?

877
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:14,688
- Psst!
- Oh.

878
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:22,261
- Is room 304 vacant?
- Yes.

879
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,766
- That's the bridal suite, you know.
- Yes, I know.

880
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:27,766
Psst!

881
00:48:31,504 --> 00:48:33,438
Oh, yeah.

882
00:48:33,506 --> 00:48:36,406
Could you please leave word
that we're not to be disturbed?

883
00:48:36,474 --> 00:48:38,407
Yes, sir.

884
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:43,301
- 304.
- Come along, dear.

885
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,657
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, indeed.

886
00:48:44,692 --> 00:48:45,936
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, indeed.

887
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,451
Edwina.
Edwina, dear.

888
00:49:00,526 --> 00:49:03,050
Barney, listen to that.
Let's not waste time.

889
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:04,560
Let him take the bags
on up to the room.

890
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:06,891
Darling, it's 11:00.
I've had a very rough day.

891
00:49:06,963 --> 00:49:10,295
- Oh, Barney, you promised.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

892
00:49:10,366 --> 00:49:13,028
Just put the keys in the room,
bring me the bags, and I'll...

893
00:49:57,568 --> 00:50:00,662
#We're poor little lambs #

894
00:50:00,737 --> 00:50:04,763
#Who have lost
our way #

895
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:06,807
# Baa... #

896
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:09,934
Barney. Barney, don't go to sleep.
This is our song.

897
00:50:10,044 --> 00:50:11,978
Oh. Yes, dear.

898
00:50:12,046 --> 00:50:14,707
#We're little black sheep #

899
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:17,613
#Who have gone astray #

900
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:19,378
- Barney?
- Hmm?

901
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:22,180
Every time I hear it,
it makes me feel...

902
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:25,653
Darling, I could never be mad
or unhappy when I hear it.

903
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,054
I just want to be near you.

904
00:50:28,124 --> 00:50:30,057
Yes, dear.

905
00:50:33,728 --> 00:50:36,196
Barney, waltz, waltz, waltz.

906
00:50:36,264 --> 00:50:38,197
Yes, dear.

907
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,608
<i>Oh, no! No!</i>

908
00:50:59,314 --> 00:51:01,281
Whew!

909
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,541
Oh, oh,
come on, Edwina.

910
00:51:04,652 --> 00:51:07,518
There you go.

911
00:51:07,587 --> 00:51:10,020
Ha-ha!
Whee!

912
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:15,291
<i>Get up, Edwina.</i>

913
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:16,292
<i>Get up, Edwina.</i>

914
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,634
Now, Edwina...

915
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,328
Get up, Edwina.
Get up.

916
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:24,371
Help me up.

917
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:25,905
Oh!

918
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:28,168
Whee, that was fun!
Barney, try it.

919
00:51:28,276 --> 00:51:30,436
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Come on, try it.

920
00:51:30,577 --> 00:51:32,044
Oh, there it is.

921
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:35,642
- Listen to me. Please, dear.
- Here we are.

922
00:51:35,748 --> 00:51:38,841
Oh, I know where the key is.
It's here. You usually keep it here.

923
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:41,417
- Oh.
- Right there. See?

924
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:43,544
- Okay, here we go.
- Really?

925
00:51:43,654 --> 00:51:47,589
Open the door.
Hooray.

926
00:51:49,891 --> 00:51:53,121
Edwina, aren't you beginning
to feel tired at all?

927
00:51:53,227 --> 00:51:55,457
Not a bit. Why?
Do you wanna go someplace?

928
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,996
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I was thinking, you know.

929
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:01,829
L- I should make a few tests,
check your blood pressure and heart.

930
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:04,401
Oh, Barnaby.

931
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:07,871
Not tonight.

932
00:52:07,939 --> 00:52:10,498
Uh, Edwina, in making such
an experiment...

933
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,073
it's always
good to make as few...

934
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:14,166
- Barney.
- What?

935
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:16,368
Are you sure
you really love me?

936
00:52:16,477 --> 00:52:18,104
Well, of course I do, dear.

937
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:20,076
Whatever made you ask
such a question?

938
00:52:20,147 --> 00:52:22,741
Well, it just occurred to me.

939
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:33,347
Now, does that
answer your question?

940
00:52:33,457 --> 00:52:36,391
You know, I love you so much
it makes me dizzy.

941
00:52:36,459 --> 00:52:38,393
- Really?
- Mmm.

942
00:52:38,461 --> 00:52:41,520
- When did that start?
- First time I ever met you.

943
00:52:41,663 --> 00:52:44,130
No, no.
I mean the dizziness.

944
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:46,165
Oh, I don't know.

945
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,996
This is our honeymoon night,
and that's all I care to think about.

946
00:52:49,102 --> 00:52:51,036
Yes, dear.

947
00:52:52,204 --> 00:52:55,900
Barney. Barney?
What are you going to do?

948
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:58,237
Oh, I was just going
to put on my pajamas.

949
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:00,276
Well, uh, uh...

950
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,211
don't you think you'd
better change in there?

951
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,837
What for?

952
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:07,812
Well, uh, well,
that-that's all right.

953
00:53:07,882 --> 00:53:11,181
I'll... I'll take my things
in the bathroom.

954
00:53:17,123 --> 00:53:19,114
For heaven's sake.

955
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:21,317
I'll only be a few minutes.

956
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:26,196
Hmm. Became suddenly shy.
I'd better put that down.

957
00:53:26,297 --> 00:53:28,230
I'll just...

958
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:32,858
Hmm.

959
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:35,902
"Fifteen minutes to change.

960
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,235
Complete reversal
of usual behavior pattern."

961
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,273
Oh.

962
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:45,009
Edwina?
Edwina, are you all right?

963
00:53:45,077 --> 00:53:47,306
<i>Yes, darling.
I'll be out in a second.</i>

964
00:53:47,412 --> 00:53:49,346
Oh. Good.

965
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:53,782
Oh, Barney, I'm so happy.

966
00:54:01,356 --> 00:54:03,289
What's the matter?

967
00:54:04,358 --> 00:54:06,758
What...

968
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,260
Well, what's the matter, darling?
Why are you crying?

969
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,263
I can't help it.

970
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,196
Well, is it because
of something I said or did?

971
00:54:14,266 --> 00:54:15,789
No.

972
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,834
Well, what is it then?

973
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:21,036
I was just thinking.

974
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:23,037
What about?

975
00:54:23,105 --> 00:54:25,039
Mother!

976
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:28,837
Oh, Mother.
Now I understand.

977
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:31,433
No, you don't.

978
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:33,137
Well, what is it then?

979
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:38,309
Oh, I can't help of thinking
how she must be feeling tonight.

980
00:54:39,418 --> 00:54:41,352
She never liked you.

981
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,979
Well, I must say
she doesn't try very hard, either.

982
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:46,056
I do everything I can
to please her.

983
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,989
How can you be
so insensitive?

984
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:52,926
She had such wonderful dreams
for me and my future.

985
00:54:52,995 --> 00:54:54,928
Well, she can still
have them, can't she?

986
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:57,055
No, she can't.
She can't.

987
00:54:57,165 --> 00:55:00,656
Edwina, we drove all the way
down here to enjoy ourselves...

988
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:03,792
and to pursue an important
scientific experiment at the same time.

989
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:07,531
Now let's not spoil it all
by having a silly quarrel about nothing.

990
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:10,573
Don't you call
my mother "nothing."

991
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,734
I didn't call
your mother "nothing."

992
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:15,504
Don't you raise
your voice to me.

993
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:17,545
I'm not raising my voice!

994
00:55:17,613 --> 00:55:19,739
Hank Entwhistle
wouldn't fly into a rage...

995
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:22,316
just because a girl happened
to mention her mother.

996
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:23,816
Oh, for heaven's sake.

997
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:26,079
What's Hank Entwhistle
got to do with anything?

998
00:55:26,187 --> 00:55:28,177
I only mentioned
Hank Entwhistle...

999
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:30,755
because my mother
was always very fond of him.

1000
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:32,790
He knew how to please her.

1001
00:55:32,858 --> 00:55:34,325
There's something clinical
about the way...

1002
00:55:34,425 --> 00:55:35,619
you bring up the name
of Hank Entwhistle...

1003
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:37,660
every time you get
annoyed with me.

1004
00:55:37,728 --> 00:55:39,786
Do you regret
not having married him?

1005
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,898
Look who's talking!

1006
00:55:41,998 --> 00:55:43,931
What about Elvira Bliss?

1007
00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:47,195
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Elvira Bliss?
That was in grammar school.

1008
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,770
I know.
She was the teacher.

1009
00:55:49,904 --> 00:55:52,428
And I suppose that Myra McKillip
was in grammar school too...

1010
00:55:52,506 --> 00:55:53,996
and Miriam Ingals...

1011
00:55:54,108 --> 00:55:57,076
whom you tried to teach
to play golf for three years!

1012
00:55:57,143 --> 00:55:59,542
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.
She's still got my putter.

1013
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:02,204
And you dare speak
of Hank Entwhistle...

1014
00:56:02,313 --> 00:56:05,009
who only kissed me once.

1015
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:07,049
He kissed you?

1016
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:09,347
Well, that's something
you never saw fit to tell me before.

1017
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:11,419
You kissed Hank Entwhistle?

1018
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,454
- I never said that!
- Oh, for...

1019
00:56:13,522 --> 00:56:15,489
I said, he kissed me!
I never kissed him!

1020
00:56:15,556 --> 00:56:18,251
- You did say exactly that.
- I said nothing of the kind!

1021
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:20,326
No, no!
My glasses.

1022
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:22,826
- You struck me! You struck me!
- Oh, no, I didn't!

1023
00:56:22,928 --> 00:56:25,021
You horrible thing!
You brute!

1024
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:28,031
- You get out of my room!
- You've really got to cut it out!

1025
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:30,089
You get out of my room!

1026
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,169
Oh, no. Edwina, now stop it.
Now, really.

1027
00:56:33,237 --> 00:56:36,069
Oh, Edwina, now this is ridiculous.
You know I can't see.

1028
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:38,106
<i>Edwina, please, let me in!</i>

1029
00:56:38,206 --> 00:56:40,731
Do you realize that
I'm out here in the hall in a...

1030
00:56:42,176 --> 00:56:45,077
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no.

1031
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:48,814
Edwina, something's
caught in the door.

1032
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:50,414
Please, let me in.

1033
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:53,650
Well, it's your own fault!

1034
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:56,720
<i>- Please, let me in!
- No.</i>

1035
00:56:56,787 --> 00:56:58,811
Uh... Oh, my.

1036
00:56:58,955 --> 00:57:02,185
Well, if there's only some way
I can make you understand.

1037
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:04,282
Oh, I know.
Edwina?

1038
00:57:04,393 --> 00:57:06,792
Edwina, dear, listen to me.

1039
00:57:08,163 --> 00:57:10,494
#We're poor little lambs #

1040
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:13,589
#Who have lost our way #

1041
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:17,600
# Baa baa baa ##

1042
00:57:17,669 --> 00:57:19,660
Edwina, are you there?

1043
00:57:21,006 --> 00:57:22,973
Edwina?
Edwina, please!

1044
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:24,802
Operator!

1045
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,311
Now, Edwina, I can't
stay out here any longer.

1046
00:57:30,379 --> 00:57:32,313
Oh, well.

1047
00:57:38,952 --> 00:57:41,385
Oh, oh.

1048
00:57:41,453 --> 00:57:42,852
Oh, you unlocked the door.

1049
00:57:42,955 --> 00:57:44,479
Well, it's about time.

1050
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:48,081
- Now, dear, if you'll just cooperate...
- Aah!

1051
00:57:48,193 --> 00:57:50,717
<i>Help! Police!
There's a man!</i>

1052
00:57:50,827 --> 00:57:52,761
<i>Help! Police!</i>

1053
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:55,353
Oh, dear.

1054
00:57:55,464 --> 00:57:57,863
I wish I knew where
there was a telephone.

1055
00:57:57,966 --> 00:57:59,729
Oh, perhaps there's one in here.

1056
00:58:05,004 --> 00:58:08,462
Hmm. You'd think there'd
be a telephone somewhere.

1057
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,599
No. Oh.

1058
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:12,643
Whoa!

1059
00:58:12,711 --> 00:58:14,812
Oh, where am I?
Ooh!

1060
00:58:14,979 --> 00:58:17,640
Yike!

1061
00:58:17,714 --> 00:58:20,808
Oh, let me in, Edwina.
Let me in.

1062
00:58:20,883 --> 00:58:22,817
The key's in the car, ma'am.

1063
00:58:22,885 --> 00:58:25,614
- All right. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1064
00:58:28,389 --> 00:58:31,323
- How's that, mister? All right?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

1065
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:35,087
Barnaby!
Oh, my poor darling!

1066
00:58:35,161 --> 00:58:37,390
Oh, Edwina, is that you?

1067
00:58:37,462 --> 00:58:40,124
Darling, I've looked
everywhere for you.

1068
00:58:40,198 --> 00:58:43,064
- What are you doing here?
- Getting out of the laundry.

1069
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:46,101
These two ladies were
kind enough to help me.

1070
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:48,796
Thank you both very much.
I'll be all right now.

1071
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,929
- We're glad to help.
- Anytime at all, mister.

1072
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:52,472
I hope I don't do it again.

1073
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:54,770
Barnaby, do you want to go
into the hotel and change?

1074
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:56,776
Oh, no. Please, just take me
away from here.

1075
00:58:56,876 --> 00:58:59,310
- Take me home.
- Well, the car's right over here.

1076
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,346
How did you get
in the laundry?

1077
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,404
Well, I don't know.
I think I flew in.

1078
00:59:03,482 --> 00:59:04,880
Look out for the step.

1079
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:06,416
But I didn't have my glasses.

1080
00:59:06,484 --> 00:59:08,474
Yes, I know.
I stepped on them.

1081
00:59:08,518 --> 00:59:10,782
- Here, you'd better put this on.
- What for?

1082
00:59:10,854 --> 00:59:13,253
- Because you might get cold.
- Oh.

1083
00:59:13,322 --> 00:59:15,790
That's it. There now.
Now get in.

1084
00:59:15,858 --> 00:59:18,621
Oh, it's... Huh.

1085
00:59:18,693 --> 00:59:20,626
Are you all right?

1086
00:59:20,694 --> 00:59:22,924
Yes, thank you, dear.
Are you?

1087
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,725
Yes. The effects of the formula
have worn off.

1088
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:27,265
Now don't talk.

1089
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,300
Just relax, and try to get
some sleep on the way home.

1090
00:59:29,368 --> 00:59:31,302
Yes, dear.

1091
00:59:50,817 --> 00:59:52,807
- Darling?
- Hmm?

1092
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:54,819
We're home.
Wake up.

1093
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:58,185
Oh, good, good, good.

1094
01:00:00,257 --> 01:00:02,191
- Oh.
- I'll help you.

1095
01:00:02,259 --> 01:00:05,056
You know what? I just had such
a peculiar dream about Hank.

1096
01:00:05,128 --> 01:00:07,119
Was that true about
you kissing him?

1097
01:00:07,196 --> 01:00:10,460
- Not that it matters, of course.
- Darling, that's so silly.

1098
01:00:10,499 --> 01:00:12,125
Oh, I just remembered.

1099
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:14,360
I did something terrible,
and I forgot to tell you.

1100
01:00:14,435 --> 01:00:15,834
<i>Hey.</i>

1101
01:00:15,902 --> 01:00:17,927
<i>- Who's that?
- Hold it.</i>

1102
01:00:18,004 --> 01:00:19,471
- You get it?
- Yep.

1103
01:00:19,506 --> 01:00:20,938
- Dr. Fulton?
- Yes.

1104
01:00:21,006 --> 01:00:22,769
We're from the news.
We'd like a statement.

1105
01:00:22,841 --> 01:00:24,307
What about?

1106
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,104
We had a call from your lawyer,
Mr. Entwhistle.

1107
01:00:26,177 --> 01:00:29,907
I do wish Hank wouldn't give out
statements to the press about my work.

1108
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,777
- Give us the whole story, Doc.
- Barney, I think...

1109
01:00:32,848 --> 01:00:34,782
Darling, I-I can't be
impolite to the gentlemen.

1110
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:37,511
I have nothing to say until
I've finished all of my experiments.

1111
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:40,382
- Is there another woman?
- No, there's no other woman.

1112
01:00:40,454 --> 01:00:42,922
My wife has been
my only victim so far.

1113
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,752
I'll have a much
better story for you...

1114
01:00:44,824 --> 01:00:47,349
when I've experimented
with ten or twenty others.

1115
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:50,520
I'm not going to try it again
with human beings for a while.

1116
01:00:50,595 --> 01:00:52,789
- I'll stick to chimpanzees.
- Is that right?

1117
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,330
Wait a minute, Barney.

1118
01:00:54,398 --> 01:00:56,422
You... You're talking about
two different things.

1119
01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:58,957
Well, what happened, Doc?
Did your wife raid your love nest?

1120
01:00:59,035 --> 01:01:00,797
Don't answer that, Barney.
You don't know what he means.

1121
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,734
Don't try to protect him.
This is good for our side.

1122
01:01:02,805 --> 01:01:03,771
What are you doing here?

1123
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:06,602
- Look out. Get inside.
- Don't do that, Mrs. Fulton.

1124
01:01:06,674 --> 01:01:09,540
- This is all the story I've got.
- That's all you're going to get.

1125
01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:12,304
What is the idea of making
statements to the press?

1126
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:14,676
Don't try to pretend
you don't know the reason.

1127
01:01:14,747 --> 01:01:16,680
I tried to tell you out on the porch,
but you wouldn't...

1128
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:19,012
You know the reason very well,
and don't pretend that you don't.

1129
01:01:19,117 --> 01:01:21,914
- It happened at the hotel last night.
- Keep your distance.

1130
01:01:21,985 --> 01:01:24,452
If you lay a hand on her,
you'll answer to me.

1131
01:01:24,487 --> 01:01:26,751
Hank, will you please
shut up and go home?

1132
01:01:26,823 --> 01:01:29,256
Barnaby, I've tried t...
Mother!

1133
01:01:29,324 --> 01:01:31,587
- Well!
- Oh, no.

1134
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:33,889
Edwina, Hank told me.

1135
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:36,656
I expected you'd be
bruised and disfigured.

1136
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,789
- But, Mother, you don't understand.
- What is everyone talking about?

1137
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:41,799
You stay away from her,
you wife-beater!

1138
01:01:41,867 --> 01:01:44,266
Mother, it isn't what you think.
Now, it's all my fault.

1139
01:01:44,335 --> 01:01:47,360
- I won't let you forgive him.
- Hank, will you please shut up?

1140
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,428
- Edwina, Hank's right.
- And you, too, Mother!

1141
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:51,940
- As your lawyer and your friend...
- Hank, you are going.

1142
01:01:52,007 --> 01:01:53,941
- But it's my duty...
- You are just one too many.

1143
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:55,908
- But you told me that...
- I know I did.

1144
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:57,774
What is it you want me to do
if you don't want...

1145
01:01:57,846 --> 01:01:59,437
I'll telephone. Now go on.

1146
01:01:59,513 --> 01:02:01,447
Now listen here,
you two.

1147
01:02:01,515 --> 01:02:02,913
No. You listen to me.

1148
01:02:02,982 --> 01:02:05,450
I'm not going to let you
throw away the rest of your life.

1149
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:07,714
Will you please tell me
what's been going on?

1150
01:02:07,786 --> 01:02:09,253
If you'll only give me...

1151
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:11,515
Oh, I just knew something
like this would happen.

1152
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:14,217
- Edwina, tell me what's...
- Quiet.

1153
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:17,384
Mother, I've been playing
guinea pig for Barnaby...

1154
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,450
trying a new formula.

1155
01:02:19,495 --> 01:02:22,793
And, under its influence,
I caused all this mess.

1156
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:26,425
Oh. Oh, you...
You mean you telephoned Hank?

1157
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:29,526
Yes, darling, I-I did that
last night after you left.

1158
01:02:29,603 --> 01:02:31,536
I'm terribly sorry,
but I couldn't help it.

1159
01:02:31,604 --> 01:02:33,902
Oh, well, I don't suppose
it was your fault, actually.

1160
01:02:33,973 --> 01:02:36,304
Oh, don't let him
dominate you again.

1161
01:02:36,374 --> 01:02:38,467
Do something, do anything,
but just don't...

1162
01:02:38,543 --> 01:02:41,636
- My-My dear mother-in-law.
- Yes?

1163
01:02:41,712 --> 01:02:45,169
Now, I have not lost my temper
with you for seven years.

1164
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:47,214
Do not trifle with your luck.

1165
01:02:47,282 --> 01:02:49,614
Well, let's be
civilized about this.

1166
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:53,141
Well, that's better.
Just mind your business and shut up!

1167
01:02:53,254 --> 01:02:55,721
Now will you drive me
to the plant, please, Edwina?

1168
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:57,313
- Right away?
- Yeah, yeah.

1169
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:58,947
As soon as I can
put on some clothes...

1170
01:02:59,024 --> 01:03:02,255
I'll try to salvage some of the wreckage
I seem to have made of our lives.

1171
01:03:02,327 --> 01:03:05,557
- Well, I...
- Mother, I think you'd better be quiet.

1172
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:10,555
- Hello, Jerome.
- Well, good morning, Mrs. Fulton.

1173
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:12,260
Doctor, I looked everywhere
for you last night.

1174
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:13,733
Later, please, Jerome.

1175
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:16,600
Right now I'd like to have
the laboratory to myself for a while.

1176
01:03:16,671 --> 01:03:19,002
Oh, yes.
Very well, Doctor.

1177
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:22,064
Edwina, my spare glasses
are in the top drawer of the desk.

1178
01:03:22,142 --> 01:03:25,269
- Would you get them, please?
- Certainly, dear.

1179
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:28,437
Here? Oh, yes,
here they are.

1180
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,913
Darling, you're
acting rather stern.

1181
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:34,143
Are you angry at me because
of what I did last night?

1182
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,775
Edwina, now, I thought
this over very carefully...

1183
01:03:36,853 --> 01:03:39,286
and I've almost
come to a conclusion.

1184
01:03:39,354 --> 01:03:41,720
I'm thinking
of destroying the formula.

1185
01:03:41,824 --> 01:03:44,587
Destroying it?
So then you are angry.

1186
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,717
Oh, I've been
in better moods.

1187
01:03:46,793 --> 01:03:49,421
Do you think you'd feel any better
if I fixed you some toast and coffee?

1188
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:51,224
You haven't had any
breakfast yet, remember?

1189
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,195
Yeah, thank you.
I'm starved.

1190
01:03:53,299 --> 01:03:55,323
Well, the coffee
and coffee pot are in there.

1191
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,129
You can use this plug
thatJerome uses.

1192
01:03:57,202 --> 01:03:58,634
All right.

1193
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:00,636
You know, I-I've decided
that the formula...

1194
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:03,035
is the most dubious
discovery since itching powder...

1195
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,039
and just about as useful.

1196
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:06,539
<i>Oh, I wouldn't say that.</i>

1197
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:09,133
<i>It cured your bursitis
and improved your vision.</i>

1198
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:11,110
<i>And I must say,
it made you feel young.</i>

1199
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:12,611
Hmm!

1200
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,613
I'm beginning to wonder
if being young...

1201
01:04:14,681 --> 01:04:16,649
is all it's cracked up to be.

1202
01:04:16,716 --> 01:04:18,239
The dream of youth.

1203
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:21,080
We remember it as a time
of nightingales and valentines...

1204
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:22,744
and what are the facts?

1205
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:26,550
Maladjustment, near idiocy,
and a series of low-comedy disasters.

1206
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:30,058
That's what youth is.
I don't see how anyone survives it.

1207
01:04:31,126 --> 01:04:33,060
- Now, Edwina?
- Hmm?

1208
01:04:33,128 --> 01:04:35,061
Tell me something,
because it's been bothering me.

1209
01:04:35,129 --> 01:04:38,359
- Yes, dear?
- Why did you want to divorce?

1210
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:40,696
Oh, Barnaby. It wasn't me.

1211
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:43,200
It was the formula.
You ought to understand that.

1212
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:46,203
Oh, I understand it was
the formula that brought it out.

1213
01:04:47,439 --> 01:04:49,373
Brought what out?

1214
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,876
Well, some subconscious
aversion to me.

1215
01:04:52,943 --> 01:04:54,933
Aversion to you?

1216
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:57,604
Well, I love you,
you potato head.

1217
01:04:58,914 --> 01:05:01,075
How do I know there isn't
some buried resentment...

1218
01:05:01,149 --> 01:05:03,139
that you don't consciously realize?

1219
01:05:03,217 --> 01:05:06,242
Well, I certainly don't
consciously realize...

1220
01:05:06,353 --> 01:05:08,488
and I think that's pretty
rotten of you to say that.

1221
01:05:08,622 --> 01:05:10,452
Wait a minute.

1222
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,480
What about the way you kept
bringing up Hank Entwhistle?

1223
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:15,924
- Oh, bosh.
- Do you love him?

1224
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:17,551
Now that is ridiculous.

1225
01:05:17,628 --> 01:05:19,562
I don't know.
You kissed him, didn't you?

1226
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,654
You can't seem to get that
out of your mind, can you?

1227
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:24,131
- No, I can't.
- Well, all right.

1228
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,667
Are you in love with this,
um, whozits?

1229
01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:28,168
Of course not.

1230
01:05:28,236 --> 01:05:31,068
Well, you went smooching
with her on roller skates.

1231
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:35,163
May I ask, what was your hidden aversion
or subconscious discontent...

1232
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:36,708
or whatever it is
you want to call it...

1233
01:05:36,776 --> 01:05:39,938
that made you go playing
patty-cake with her all over town?

1234
01:05:40,012 --> 01:05:42,946
Doing a swan-dive,
acting like a...

1235
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,415
Well, go on.

1236
01:05:47,851 --> 01:05:49,841
Oh, Barnaby.

1237
01:05:49,919 --> 01:05:52,853
Don't say anything, darling,
and I won't either.

1238
01:05:53,988 --> 01:05:56,820
We shouldn't be fighting...

1239
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,881
having doubts
about our marriage.

1240
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:01,722
- That isn't right.
- Well, that's just my point.

1241
01:06:01,794 --> 01:06:04,456
That's why I'm going
to destroy the formula.

1242
01:06:08,433 --> 01:06:11,060
Oh, now, really.
Are you crying?

1243
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:13,068
Hmm.

1244
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:19,205
Are you sure you wanna
throw away two years of hard work?

1245
01:06:19,274 --> 01:06:23,107
Yes, I am. But it's still
in my head, unfortunately.

1246
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:24,666
I'm going to forget it.

1247
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:27,304
It's too dangerous.
It's utterly unpredictable.

1248
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:31,173
Oh, no. Now, please, please.

1249
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,876
Don't use this water.
Can't you see the sign?

1250
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:35,545
Just use the bottled water
out of the cooler.

1251
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:40,345
And make plenty of coffee.
I need a lot this morning.

1252
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:42,356
That's that.

1253
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:49,762
Hello?
This is Mr. Oxly.

1254
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,821
Oh, Mr. Oxly,
Dr. Fulton's here in the plant.

1255
01:06:51,899 --> 01:06:53,388
He just came in with Mrs. Fulton.

1256
01:06:53,466 --> 01:06:55,400
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1257
01:06:55,468 --> 01:06:58,368
Well, how is Mrs. Fulton?
Is she behaving normally?

1258
01:06:58,437 --> 01:07:01,769
Well, she didn't try to hit me,
but she wasn't very polite.

1259
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,773
<i>- She said that...
- Never mind.</i>

1260
01:07:03,841 --> 01:07:07,003
Now listen carefully, Miss Laurel.
I don't want them to leave.

1261
01:07:07,077 --> 01:07:09,340
Have the guards hold 'em
if they try to go.

1262
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:11,345
<i>- You understand?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1263
01:07:11,413 --> 01:07:13,346
And notify the entire
board of directors...

1264
01:07:13,414 --> 01:07:15,746
that I want to see them in
the conference room immediately.

1265
01:07:15,817 --> 01:07:18,080
<i>- I'll be right down.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1266
01:07:22,888 --> 01:07:25,651
My, this is funny-tasting coffee.
It's bitter.

1267
01:07:25,724 --> 01:07:28,157
Yeah, I noticed it.
It's not the coffee.

1268
01:07:28,225 --> 01:07:31,626
It's the aftereffects of the formula.
Hmm. The formula.

1269
01:07:31,695 --> 01:07:34,925
What a fool I was to let you
take that stuff last night.

1270
01:07:34,998 --> 01:07:37,261
- Well, you couldn't help it.
- Hmm.

1271
01:07:37,332 --> 01:07:39,664
- Hey, that's your third cup.
- I know it.

1272
01:07:39,735 --> 01:07:41,668
That's your second cup,
isn't it?

1273
01:07:41,736 --> 01:07:43,670
- Yes.
- Good.

1274
01:07:43,738 --> 01:07:46,706
Supposing you'd taken an overdose?

1275
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:50,401
- Perhaps I did.
- No, I mean a serious overdose.

1276
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:52,409
You know,
it's perfectly logical to assume...

1277
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,707
that you'd have
behaved even younger.

1278
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,643
You remember
Mr. Oxly jumping around?

1279
01:07:56,713 --> 01:07:58,146
Yeah.

1280
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:01,650
My, I'm going to be embarrassed
when I see him again. Hmm!

1281
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:05,716
How young do you think
it could really make you...

1282
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:08,414
if you drank a whole glassful?

1283
01:08:08,455 --> 01:08:10,719
Oh, I don't know.

1284
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:13,850
Twelve, ten, five...

1285
01:08:13,926 --> 01:08:15,984
It might even turn you
into an infant.

1286
01:08:16,061 --> 01:08:18,552
Hmm-hmm.

1287
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:21,723
I was just imagining you
not being able to talk...

1288
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:24,358
or feed yourself even.

1289
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,698
It could be very embarrassing.

1290
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,203
Yeah, couldn't it be?

1291
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,000
Well, you know that's just
about what could happen.

1292
01:08:32,073 --> 01:08:35,405
<i>Ah! Ta-da. I'll get it.</i>

1293
01:08:35,442 --> 01:08:37,603
Hello? Hi!

1294
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:40,612
Hey, did you ever find the fish?
What'd you do with him?

1295
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,113
Ha! Yeah, I'm keen.

1296
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:44,614
He's here. Just a minute.
It's old Oxly.

1297
01:08:44,716 --> 01:08:48,116
What's on your mind?
Ha-ha-ha.

1298
01:08:48,152 --> 01:08:50,450
Barnaby, could you and your wife
meet me right away?

1299
01:08:50,521 --> 01:08:52,454
We're just here drinking coffee.

1300
01:08:52,522 --> 01:08:55,354
<i>- I'll be in the conference room.
- We'll be right there.</i>

1301
01:08:55,424 --> 01:08:58,188
Put that back, please.
Put that back, please.

1302
01:08:59,326 --> 01:09:02,659
Any other orders, sir?
Going up.

1303
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:04,856
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

1304
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:07,865
Dr. Fulton will be here shortly,
so please be seated.

1305
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:09,662
We must act quickly.

1306
01:09:09,735 --> 01:09:11,361
You all know why you're here...

1307
01:09:11,436 --> 01:09:13,404
to negotiate with Dr. Fulton
for his formula.

1308
01:09:13,471 --> 01:09:16,064
As far as money goes,
I say all out, and hang the expense.

1309
01:09:16,139 --> 01:09:18,164
Yes, but as chairman
of your board of directors...

1310
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:20,674
I want to point out that Fulton
made his discovery on our time.

1311
01:09:20,743 --> 01:09:24,473
I've got bad news for you, G. J.
We do not have the formula.

1312
01:09:24,546 --> 01:09:27,446
- What?
- Last night, Dr. Lentil...

1313
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:30,449
- Dr. Linten.
- Dr. Linten, Dr. Fulton's assistant...

1314
01:09:30,517 --> 01:09:32,814
brought me a dose
of the formula, and I took it.

1315
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:35,978
I can't tell you with what eagerness
I awaited the results...

1316
01:09:36,054 --> 01:09:37,646
but there were none.

1317
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:39,883
<i>No reactions at all.</i>

1318
01:09:39,957 --> 01:09:43,187
The formula that Dr. Thingamabob
brought me is incomplete.

1319
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:44,988
Now, there must be
another ingredient...

1320
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:46,494
that he knows nothing about.

1321
01:09:46,563 --> 01:09:48,496
Dr. Fulton has made
no record of it...

1322
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:51,293
and there's nothing in his notes
to tell us what it is.

1323
01:09:51,365 --> 01:09:53,526
And without that ingredient,
we are helpless.

1324
01:09:53,634 --> 01:09:57,228
Failure to keep complete records is
against every rule of this organization.

1325
01:09:57,304 --> 01:09:59,737
Fulton knows that.
He's been an employee for ten years.

1326
01:09:59,805 --> 01:10:01,568
Failure may not have
been intentional.

1327
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:04,540
- Fulton was not himself yesterday.
- No, definitely not.

1328
01:10:04,642 --> 01:10:06,405
Well, let's hope he's himself now.

1329
01:10:06,444 --> 01:10:08,070
There's no doubt about it.

1330
01:10:08,145 --> 01:10:10,545
We are now dealing with
a sane and adult scientist...

1331
01:10:10,646 --> 01:10:12,841
and I anticipate no difficulties.

1332
01:10:12,915 --> 01:10:14,848
Well?

1333
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:17,476
All right, Oliver, go ahead
if you want to. It's up to you.

1334
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:19,485
I wonder what's keeping them.

1335
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:22,078
- Doctor, would you mind taking a look?
- Yes, sir.

1336
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:28,393
Hmm. Uh...

1337
01:10:31,763 --> 01:10:34,390
Oh, Barnaby, Mrs. Fulton,
come on in.

1338
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:37,958
Uh, what's the matter?
No. Come on in.

1339
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:40,297
Mrs. Fulton,
forget all about last night.

1340
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:43,235
- I assure you I have. Come in.
- Yes, yes.

1341
01:10:43,304 --> 01:10:46,068
You fellows are always
experimenting, aren't you?

1342
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,608
I believe you know
everybody here.

1343
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:51,438
Yes. Come on.
There you go.

1344
01:10:51,511 --> 01:10:53,240
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

1345
01:10:53,312 --> 01:10:54,801
Make yourself comfortable.

1346
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,973
Oh, Mrs. Fulton,
won't you sit over here?

1347
01:10:57,048 --> 01:10:59,106
Do I have to?

1348
01:10:59,183 --> 01:11:01,549
<i>- No.
- I wanna sit here.</i>

1349
01:11:01,619 --> 01:11:03,483
All right.

1350
01:11:03,553 --> 01:11:06,248
Barnaby, I think I speak
for everyone here...

1351
01:11:06,321 --> 01:11:09,620
when I say that I consider you
one of the great men of modern science.

1352
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:11,316
Now, I asked you
to come here today...

1353
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,223
to discuss
the sale of your formula.

1354
01:11:13,294 --> 01:11:15,227
<i>Our organization...</i>

1355
01:11:17,697 --> 01:11:20,893
Our organization is ready
to offer you a block of stock...

1356
01:11:20,966 --> 01:11:24,059
the income from which is sufficient
to keep you and Mrs. Fulton...

1357
01:11:26,336 --> 01:11:29,430
to keep you and Mrs. Fulton
in comfort for the rest of your lives.

1358
01:11:29,473 --> 01:11:33,272
Now the question is,
how much cash do you want?

1359
01:11:33,342 --> 01:11:35,468
Mmm.

1360
01:11:35,544 --> 01:11:38,137
<i>Barnaby?</i>

1361
01:11:38,245 --> 01:11:40,076
I said, how much cash
do you want?

1362
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:45,483
How much?
Oh.

1363
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:47,849
- Name any amount.
- A zillion dollars.

1364
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,232
- What?
- How much did he say?

1365
01:11:49,267 --> 01:11:50,543
- What?
- How much did he say?

1366
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:52,451
A zillion dollars.
That's a million trillion.

1367
01:11:52,557 --> 01:11:54,751
- By George, he's taken it again!
- Obviously.

1368
01:11:54,858 --> 01:11:56,382
Look here, Fulton.

1369
01:11:56,459 --> 01:11:58,187
Your discovery was our property
in the first place.

1370
01:11:58,294 --> 01:12:00,489
<i>- Now take it easy.
- We don't have to give you a cent.</i>

1371
01:12:00,596 --> 01:12:02,085
Oh, I wish I had a nickel.

1372
01:12:02,163 --> 01:12:03,858
Fulton, I'll blackball you
out of the chemical industry!

1373
01:12:03,965 --> 01:12:06,489
- You're talking to a child, G. J.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1374
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,000
- He's no child.
- Oh, what you said. Put 'em up!

1375
01:12:09,102 --> 01:12:11,831
Here, give me something.
Knock that off my shoulder.

1376
01:12:11,938 --> 01:12:14,132
Barnaby, when we get mad,
we don't fight, do we?

1377
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,639
- Yes, we do.
- They didn't teach you that in school.

1378
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,267
Well, who care...
Hi!

1379
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,344
Hello, Dr. Fulton.

1380
01:12:21,444 --> 01:12:24,607
- Did you come to play with me?
- No. I came to tell Mr. Oxly...

1381
01:12:24,714 --> 01:12:26,681
Never mind, Miss Laurel.
I think you'd better go.

1382
01:12:26,748 --> 01:12:28,682
No, no, no. I want her
to stay and play with me.

1383
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,182
Well, if I let her stay...

1384
01:12:30,284 --> 01:12:32,184
will you tell me the missing
ingredient in your formula?

1385
01:12:32,253 --> 01:12:34,447
- Yes, yes!
- All right, go ahead.

1386
01:12:34,554 --> 01:12:37,454
'Well, well. All right,
now-now say "terrify."

1387
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:39,491
- Terrify.
- Now say "tissue."

1388
01:12:39,525 --> 01:12:41,492
- Tissue.
- Now say them both fast together.

1389
01:12:41,526 --> 01:12:43,585
- Terrify tissue.
- No!

1390
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:48,188
- How dare you!
- Oh, goody, goody!

1391
01:12:48,298 --> 01:12:50,527
<i>- Why, Miss Laurel...
- Really, Mr. Ox...</i>

1392
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:53,465
- But I don't...
- Don't you do that. Oh! You too!

1393
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:58,833
I did it! I pinched her!
I shot her!

1394
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:00,873
Oh, now you've
spoiled everything!

1395
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:02,874
Did you see her run?
She's a scaredy-cat!

1396
01:13:02,942 --> 01:13:05,603
Now, little girl, you stop it!
Hear me? Stop it!

1397
01:13:05,711 --> 01:13:07,645
<i>Now you come over here.</i>

1398
01:13:07,713 --> 01:13:09,680
You sit in that chair
and behave yourself.

1399
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:13,237
- You understand? Behave yourself!
- Yes, sir.

1400
01:13:13,316 --> 01:13:15,443
<i>Now, Barnaby?</i>

1401
01:13:15,552 --> 01:13:18,042
- Barnaby? Barnaby, where are you?
- He's under the table.

1402
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,054
Barnaby, what are you
doing under there?

1403
01:13:20,122 --> 01:13:21,679
Tickling Esther.

1404
01:13:21,789 --> 01:13:23,723
Now come on out.
I wanna talk to you.

1405
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:25,417
I don't wanna talk anymore.

1406
01:13:25,492 --> 01:13:28,154
G. J., we're dealing
with a ten-year-old.

1407
01:13:28,262 --> 01:13:30,092
We've got to humor him.
There's no other way.

1408
01:13:30,196 --> 01:13:31,561
If you say so, Oliver.

1409
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:35,224
Well, come on down here and help me!
Don't just stand there!

1410
01:13:37,468 --> 01:13:39,868
Barnaby?
Barnaby, I want to talk to you.

1411
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,903
- Want to tickle Esther? She likes it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1412
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:43,632
How would you like to have...

1413
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,866
a nice gold watch
and chain all your own?

1414
01:13:45,974 --> 01:13:47,635
- Oh.
- Would you like that, Barnaby?

1415
01:13:47,743 --> 01:13:49,676
- I've got one.
- But not like this one.

1416
01:13:49,744 --> 01:13:51,211
No, no, I don't want it.

1417
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:53,041
Well, would you like
a new bicycle or a pony?

1418
01:13:53,146 --> 01:13:54,545
How would you like that?

1419
01:13:54,614 --> 01:13:56,206
Oh.
What do I have to do for it?

1420
01:13:56,316 --> 01:13:59,216
All you have to do is to tell us
what was the ingredient...

1421
01:13:59,285 --> 01:14:00,649
that you put in the formula.

1422
01:14:00,752 --> 01:14:02,117
Oh. Oh.

1423
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,245
Well, you promised me
a zillion dollars and a nickel.

1424
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:06,413
- We'll give you a zillion dollars.
- And a nickel.

1425
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:09,424
And-And a motorboat,
and-and-and a new pony.

1426
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:11,119
- Yes, how would you like that?
- When?

1427
01:14:11,227 --> 01:14:13,160
Just as soon as you tell us
what the ingredient was...

1428
01:14:13,228 --> 01:14:14,593
you added to the formula.

1429
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:16,424
Oh, that's simple.
I just added...

1430
01:14:18,465 --> 01:14:20,659
<i>Oh! Now look what...</i>

1431
01:14:20,767 --> 01:14:23,497
Barnaby! Barnaby!
Aren't you gonna tell us, Barnaby?

1432
01:14:23,603 --> 01:14:25,900
- What you wanna write that for?
- Because it's true, true!

1433
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,131
- It isn't, and you're gonna erase it!
- I won't!

1434
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,707
Barnaby, you promised
to give us the ingredient!

1435
01:14:30,808 --> 01:14:32,832
- You can't make me!
- Yes, I will!

1436
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:35,171
- Barnaby!
- Head her off!

1437
01:14:35,278 --> 01:14:39,304
- You big bully! I'll tell my mother!
- Stop her, somebody!

1438
01:14:39,415 --> 01:14:42,440
<i>- Barnaby, you can't catch me!
- Why don't you help me catch her?</i>

1439
01:14:42,517 --> 01:14:44,984
- If we catch her, will you tell us?
- Sure!

1440
01:14:45,052 --> 01:14:47,748
- Somebody, stop her there! Catch her!
- Stop! King's X!

1441
01:14:47,854 --> 01:14:49,787
- What was it?
- Heat!

1442
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:51,720
I heated the mixture
to 150 degrees Fahrenheit!

1443
01:14:51,824 --> 01:14:53,290
By George, we've got it!

1444
01:14:53,358 --> 01:14:55,451
No fair! No fair!

1445
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,789
- Now I got you. Go on, erase it.
- No, I won't!

1446
01:14:57,895 --> 01:14:59,829
- Yes, you erase it!
- You hurt me! Let go!

1447
01:14:59,897 --> 01:15:03,798
You big crybaby!
You erase it and... Aah!

1448
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:06,095
<i>Esther, what are you
doing up there?</i>

1449
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:09,192
<i>- Come down here this instant.
- Mr. Oxly, they're getting away!</i>

1450
01:15:09,303 --> 01:15:12,237
Let 'em go, Doctor.
You heard what he said.

1451
01:15:12,305 --> 01:15:14,466
We got what we wanted.
That's all that matters.

1452
01:15:14,574 --> 01:15:16,734
- We've got to be sure.
- Don't bother me now. I'm busy.

1453
01:15:16,842 --> 01:15:18,309
<i>Esther, come here now!</i>

1454
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:20,468
<i>G. J., we're standing on the brink
of a new world and the new...</i>

1455
01:15:20,578 --> 01:15:23,842
- What is it you want?
- I heated the formula I gave to you...

1456
01:15:23,947 --> 01:15:27,144
Get that monkey down from there!
What'd you say?

1457
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,444
I heated the formula
I gave to you last night.

1458
01:15:29,552 --> 01:15:32,179
- It didn't do a...
- He's fooled us again!

1459
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:34,619
Well, don't stand there!
Go and catch him!

1460
01:15:34,723 --> 01:15:37,987
Run after him! Go on!
Get a policeman! Get two policemen!

1461
01:15:42,095 --> 01:15:44,528
When are you gonna
stop tagging after me?

1462
01:15:44,629 --> 01:15:46,563
When I want to.

1463
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:49,793
- Why don't you go play with girls?
- Why can't I play with you?

1464
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,867
I don't want you to,
that's why. Oh!

1465
01:15:51,968 --> 01:15:54,801
- Barnaby Fulton, I don't like you.
- Then go away.

1466
01:15:54,904 --> 01:15:56,871
I will not. So there.

1467
01:16:00,174 --> 01:16:02,108
Then don't go away.

1468
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:08,408
Hmm!

1469
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:14,714
I'll tell my mother.

1470
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:17,343
Hmm.

1471
01:16:17,454 --> 01:16:19,421
Here's one for your mother.

1472
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:25,122
I'll tell Hank Entwhistle.

1473
01:16:28,262 --> 01:16:31,026
Here's two
for Hank Entwhistle.

1474
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:38,929
Oh, now look
what you've done!

1475
01:16:39,071 --> 01:16:41,436
<i>- I'm gonna tell Hank Entwhistle!
- Hey!</i>

1476
01:16:41,506 --> 01:16:43,405
Leave that paintbrush here!

1477
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:47,109
Crybaby!

1478
01:16:59,819 --> 01:17:02,481
He's gonna be sorry
for what he did.

1479
01:17:02,588 --> 01:17:04,578
Very, very sorry.

1480
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:06,623
I'm gonna call
Hank Entwhistle.

1481
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:09,090
That's what I'll do.

1482
01:17:09,193 --> 01:17:11,387
I'll call Hank.

1483
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,399
Hmm! Hmm!

1484
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,470
<i>Hello?</i>

1485
01:17:24,538 --> 01:17:26,937
I wanna speak to
Hank Entwhistle, please.

1486
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:29,837
<i>- You mean Mr. Entwhistle?
- That's what I said.</i>

1487
01:17:29,942 --> 01:17:33,536
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- I'll show him. I'll...</i>

1488
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:35,578
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Hank?</i>

1489
01:17:35,646 --> 01:17:38,410
<i>- This is Edwina.
- Oh, hello, Edwina.</i>

1490
01:17:38,515 --> 01:17:40,539
<i>Would you come over
to my house right away?</i>

1491
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,083
What's the matter?

1492
01:17:42,185 --> 01:17:44,243
It's Barnaby.

1493
01:17:44,352 --> 01:17:47,582
He threw a whole bucket
of paint all over me!

1494
01:17:47,688 --> 01:17:49,622
See?

1495
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:52,249
<i>- What did you do?
- I didn't do a thing.</i>

1496
01:17:52,358 --> 01:17:54,655
<i>- Hmm!
- He must've gone mad.</i>

1497
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,024
<i>I don't ever wanna
see him again.</i>

1498
01:17:57,162 --> 01:18:00,927
Edwina, are you gonna go through
with it this time and really leave him?

1499
01:18:01,032 --> 01:18:05,400
Yes, I'm going to go away.
Far, far away.

1500
01:18:05,469 --> 01:18:08,596
<i>- Hmm!
- I'm gonna go away and...</i>

1501
01:18:10,705 --> 01:18:13,640
<i>Hello? Hello, Edwina?
Edwina, what's the matter?</i>

1502
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,699
Huh? Oh.
I don't know.

1503
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:20,301
I just suddenly feel very sleepy.

1504
01:18:20,413 --> 01:18:22,937
That's shock, Edwina.
I saw a lot of it in the army.

1505
01:18:23,048 --> 01:18:25,642
Now just lie down and keep warm,
and it'll go away in a few minutes...

1506
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,182
and I'll be right over.

1507
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:28,911
<i>- Good-bye.
- Hmm, hmm, hmm!</i>

1508
01:18:33,857 --> 01:18:36,450
So he's comin' over here, huh?
Hmm, hmm, hmm!

1509
01:18:36,558 --> 01:18:39,219
What'll I do to him?

1510
01:18:39,327 --> 01:18:42,921
That's what I'll do. I'll get my gang.
I'll scalp him! Scalp him.

1511
01:18:43,029 --> 01:18:45,327
Hank Entwhistle.

1512
01:18:45,432 --> 01:18:47,831
You wait till you see
what I do to him. Ha!

1513
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,663
I'll scalp him, that's what
I'm gonna do. Scalp him.

1514
01:18:51,803 --> 01:18:53,771
Oh, ra!

1515
01:18:53,872 --> 01:18:55,805
Ra, ra!

1516
01:18:58,574 --> 01:19:00,508
Big chief.

1517
01:19:00,576 --> 01:19:03,806
Big chief. I'll fix him.
I'll show him.

1518
01:19:03,912 --> 01:19:07,108
Oh!

1519
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:09,148
- Why, Dr. Fulton!
- Shh!

1520
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,876
I'm just getting this
to scalp a man.

1521
01:19:10,984 --> 01:19:12,451
- What are you...
- Shh!

1522
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:29,229
The things
some people think of.

1523
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,357
- Morning, Mrs. Brannigan.
- Morning.

1524
01:19:34,468 --> 01:19:36,629
- You gonna be here for a while?
- Yeah, I should be another hour or so.

1525
01:19:36,737 --> 01:19:38,499
Would you mind watching Johnny?

1526
01:19:38,604 --> 01:19:40,572
I have to go to market,
and it's too much trouble to drag him.

1527
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,335
- Sure, I'll watch him for you.
- I won't be long.

1528
01:19:43,441 --> 01:19:46,409
All right. What?

1529
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:49,570
Come on, Johnny.
Here we go.

1530
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,308
Here. Now, there's a nice
big yard for you to play in.

1531
01:19:53,415 --> 01:19:56,441
You all right? Okay.

1532
01:19:59,287 --> 01:20:02,722
What do you want us to do
with the bad man, Red Eagle?

1533
01:20:02,822 --> 01:20:04,756
Yeah, Red Eagle.
Tell us.

1534
01:20:04,824 --> 01:20:06,950
Well, first we stop his car
and then capture him.

1535
01:20:07,059 --> 01:20:08,720
Then what do we do with him?

1536
01:20:08,827 --> 01:20:11,317
- Let's tie him to a stake.
- And then burn him!

1537
01:20:11,429 --> 01:20:13,362
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and burn him good!

1538
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:15,523
- That won't work.
- Who said that?

1539
01:20:15,632 --> 01:20:17,792
I did.

1540
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,130
Oh, you.
Why won't it work?

1541
01:20:20,236 --> 01:20:22,499
Somebody will stop us
the minute we light a fire.

1542
01:20:22,604 --> 01:20:24,037
They always do.

1543
01:20:24,105 --> 01:20:27,073
- Yeah, that's right.
- What do you say, Red Eagle?

1544
01:20:27,141 --> 01:20:30,803
Well, let's tie him to a stake
and scalp him. That's it.

1545
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,844
- You mean for real?
- Sure.

1546
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:36,210
You can't scalp anybody
unless you do a war dance first.

1547
01:20:36,348 --> 01:20:39,248
Oh. Well, just a minute.
I'll-I'll-I'll remember that.

1548
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:41,249
You two braves...

1549
01:20:41,351 --> 01:20:44,787
Can't scalp anybody
unless you do a war dance first.

1550
01:20:44,888 --> 01:20:48,550
<i>- He's right, Red Eagle.
- Well, we can scalp him, can't we?</i>

1551
01:20:48,657 --> 01:20:51,056
You have to do
a war dance first.

1552
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,024
Do you know a war dance,
Red Eagle?

1553
01:20:53,093 --> 01:20:55,493
Ah... Well, sure.

1554
01:20:57,063 --> 01:21:00,226
That's no good.
You gotta sing when you do it.

1555
01:21:00,366 --> 01:21:03,391
Oh. Oh, you gotta sing.

1556
01:21:03,468 --> 01:21:05,492
Well, all right, we'll sing.

1557
01:21:05,603 --> 01:21:07,571
Oh, you with the drum,
give me a beat.

1558
01:21:07,671 --> 01:21:12,834
Uh, bum-bum-bum-bum.
Bum-bum... You sing.

1559
01:21:12,941 --> 01:21:14,875
# Me want a wampum #

1560
01:21:14,943 --> 01:21:16,910
- # Me want a wampum #
- You sing too.

1561
01:21:16,978 --> 01:21:18,639
- # Me want a wampum #
- You go, "Ugh!"

1562
01:21:18,746 --> 01:21:20,509
- # Me want a wampum #
- Ugh!

1563
01:21:20,614 --> 01:21:22,548
- # Me want a wampum #
- Ugh!

1564
01:21:22,616 --> 01:21:26,210
Ugga, ugga, gloop, gloop!
Ugga, ugga, gloop, gloop!

1565
01:21:26,352 --> 01:21:29,184
- Ugga, ugga, gloop, gloop! Ugh!
- # Me want a wampum #

1566
01:21:29,254 --> 01:21:31,814
You go,
"Ahi, ho, ho, ho."

1567
01:21:31,923 --> 01:21:35,380
- #Ahi, ho, ho, ho #
- #Ahi, ho, ho, ho #

1568
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:37,619
Ugh!
# Me want a wampum #

1569
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:41,457
- # Scalp a paleface #
- # Scalp a paleface #

1570
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,997
- # Me want a wampum #
- Ugh!

1571
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:47,056
Now you go,
"Aho, ho, ho!"

1572
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:49,100
#Aho, ho, ho #

1573
01:21:49,168 --> 01:21:52,898
- #Aho, ho, ho #
- #Aho, ho, ho #

1574
01:22:27,298 --> 01:22:29,561
# Di-di-di-di-di #

1575
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:50,013
Barnaby!

1576
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:53,015
Darling, speak to me!
Say something!

1577
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:55,017
Oh, my darl...

1578
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:04,817
Operator!
Operator, get a taxi, will you?

1579
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:06,859
Uh, this is 1605 Gilcrest.

1580
01:23:06,927 --> 01:23:09,190
Send a taxi right away.
Emergency. Thank you.

1581
01:23:09,295 --> 01:23:11,422
Darling!
Oh, darling!

1582
01:23:12,764 --> 01:23:17,200
Barnaby, are you trying
to say something?

1583
01:23:17,268 --> 01:23:20,031
Well, speak to me.

1584
01:23:20,136 --> 01:23:22,229
Barnaby, I'm your wife.

1585
01:23:22,339 --> 01:23:25,000
Say something!

1586
01:23:25,107 --> 01:23:29,304
Oh, my poor husband.
What have you done to yourself?

1587
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:33,209
- Driver, hurry. Please hurry.
- Yes, ma'am.

1588
01:23:34,314 --> 01:23:36,804
Right this way, mister.

1589
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:38,850
Hello, kids.

1590
01:23:38,918 --> 01:23:40,851
Hi.

1591
01:23:40,919 --> 01:23:43,751
Well, why did Mrs. Fulton
say to meet her here?

1592
01:23:43,854 --> 01:23:45,788
She didn't say.

1593
01:23:45,856 --> 01:23:48,722
Was Mr. Fulton there?
I mean, at the house?

1594
01:23:48,825 --> 01:23:52,726
- He could've been.
- Oh, that's the reason. I see it now.

1595
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:55,353
Mister, will you play with us?

1596
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:57,795
We need a nice tall man
to play maypole.

1597
01:23:57,898 --> 01:23:59,660
Well, I'm sorry,
but I haven't time now.

1598
01:23:59,766 --> 01:24:01,700
Don't you like children?

1599
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:03,894
Of course I like children.

1600
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:05,970
Why are you mean
to 'em then?

1601
01:24:06,038 --> 01:24:08,767
- I'm not mean to them.
- Don't you wanna make us happy?

1602
01:24:08,873 --> 01:24:11,500
- Of course I do.
- Then play maypole.

1603
01:24:11,608 --> 01:24:13,576
All right,
I'll play maypole with you...

1604
01:24:13,677 --> 01:24:15,166
if you'll go tell
Mrs. Fulton I'm here.

1605
01:24:15,277 --> 01:24:18,713
- Okay.
- You're nice to play maypole with us.

1606
01:24:18,781 --> 01:24:21,772
Now you step right back here
against this tree...

1607
01:24:21,883 --> 01:24:23,816
and hold this up real high.

1608
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:26,614
- All right.
- That's fine. Come on!

1609
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:32,823
I thought you were
gonna tell Mrs. Fulton.

1610
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:34,415
Can't I watch for a minute?

1611
01:24:34,559 --> 01:24:37,459
No. You promised you'd do it
if I play maypole.

1612
01:24:37,561 --> 01:24:39,585
What was it
I promised to tell her?

1613
01:24:39,696 --> 01:24:43,131
You tell her that I'm here.
Now why don't you...

1614
01:24:43,232 --> 01:24:46,429
You're getting this too tight!
I can't move!

1615
01:24:46,568 --> 01:24:48,535
You can come out now,
Red Eagle!

1616
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:01,778
Fulton, have you gone
stark raving out of your mind?

1617
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,006
Oh, Mrs. Fulton,
I have a message for you...

1618
01:25:04,114 --> 01:25:06,309
- I'm sorry, but I don't have time.
- Mr. Oxly wants to see you.

1619
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:08,748
Yes, and I wanna see him too.

1620
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:12,650
Oh, Miss Laurel.
Oh, for goodness sake.

1621
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:14,914
Mr. Oxly? Mr. Oxly?

1622
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:17,991
You've got to do something
about Barnaby and right away.

1623
01:25:18,092 --> 01:25:20,184
There, there, little girl.
Now don't get excited.

1624
01:25:20,293 --> 01:25:22,124
Would you like some lemonade
or a piece of candy?

1625
01:25:22,228 --> 01:25:24,092
Oh, stop it, Mr. Oxly.
Stop it.

1626
01:25:24,196 --> 01:25:26,629
The formula has worn off.
I'm not a little girl any longer.

1627
01:25:26,697 --> 01:25:27,742
- It's Barnaby I'm talking about.
- What is he up to now?

1628
01:25:27,777 --> 01:25:28,788
- It's Barnaby I'm talking about.
- What is he up to now?

1629
01:25:28,933 --> 01:25:30,900
You've got to save him.
You've got to bring him back.

1630
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,434
I'm trying to.

1631
01:25:32,469 --> 01:25:34,993
I've got everyone, including half
the police force, trying to find him.

1632
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,868
- Do you know where he is?
- He's right here in my arms.

1633
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:39,668
Now, Mrs. Fulton, don't cry.

1634
01:25:39,741 --> 01:25:41,470
Remember, you are the wife
of a great scientist.

1635
01:25:41,543 --> 01:25:43,772
Oh, poor Barnaby.
He was so brilliant.

1636
01:25:43,844 --> 01:25:46,471
- Now look at him.
- It's a pretty baby. Is it yours?

1637
01:25:46,546 --> 01:25:49,276
- Of course he is.
- I didn't know you had a child.

1638
01:25:49,348 --> 01:25:52,316
- Mr. Oxly, this is Barnaby.
- What?

1639
01:25:52,384 --> 01:25:55,181
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. This is my husband!

1640
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:58,050
You mean the formula has gone too far,
and this is the result?

1641
01:25:58,122 --> 01:26:00,089
- Yes.
- I can't believe it.

1642
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:02,919
Well, it's true, and you've got
to do something about it!

1643
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:06,221
By George! By George!

1644
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:09,320
<i>- Oxly speaking.
- Yes, Oliver?</i>

1645
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,397
Prepare yourself for a shock, G. J.

1646
01:26:11,465 --> 01:26:14,797
Dr. Fulton's formula has backfired
and turned him into a baby.

1647
01:26:14,867 --> 01:26:18,063
<i>- A complete idiot, huh?
- No, not an idiot. A baby.</i>

1648
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:21,105
<i>- An infant two feet tall.
- Don't talk rubbish, Oliver.</i>

1649
01:26:21,206 --> 01:26:23,070
I'm not talking rubbish.
I can see, can't I?

1650
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:24,539
<i>I wonder.</i>

1651
01:26:24,641 --> 01:26:26,403
We've got to find an antidote...

1652
01:26:26,442 --> 01:26:28,706
and we can't do that until
we know what was in the formula.

1653
01:26:28,778 --> 01:26:31,109
<i>Just get the truth out
of Fulton any way you can.</i>

1654
01:26:31,179 --> 01:26:33,374
Well, come on in here
and help me.

1655
01:26:33,448 --> 01:26:35,540
All right, now we've
got to find out...

1656
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:39,846
Shh. Mr. Oxly,
he's trying to say something.

1657
01:26:39,919 --> 01:26:42,182
What are you
trying to say, darling?

1658
01:26:42,254 --> 01:26:45,348
Well, go ahead, tell me.
Please try.

1659
01:26:45,457 --> 01:26:46,855
Let me talk to him.

1660
01:26:46,924 --> 01:26:50,256
Barnaby, I'm going to
speak to you very slowly...

1661
01:26:50,327 --> 01:26:52,659
so as not to confuse you.

1662
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:55,697
But we're going to do
everything we can to help you...

1663
01:26:55,764 --> 01:26:57,754
but you've got to help too.

1664
01:26:57,866 --> 01:27:01,801
- You understand?
- Barnaby, please listen. Try hard.

1665
01:27:01,869 --> 01:27:03,803
This might help.
Listen.

1666
01:27:03,871 --> 01:27:07,465
He remembers.

1667
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:11,475
He wouldn't take it before,
and now he will.

1668
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:14,271
Barnaby,
we can't find the antidote...

1669
01:27:14,345 --> 01:27:16,279
until we know the real formula.

1670
01:27:16,347 --> 01:27:19,247
- Well, don't frighten him.
- I didn't say anything to frighten him.

1671
01:27:19,315 --> 01:27:21,374
He's being evasive again.

1672
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:24,681
Barnaby, you lied to us about
the missing ingredient.

1673
01:27:24,753 --> 01:27:27,619
Now, what is it?

1674
01:27:28,789 --> 01:27:31,586
Oh, Mr. Oxly, he can't talk!

1675
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:34,115
What are we going to do?
We can't wait until he grows up.

1676
01:27:34,226 --> 01:27:35,784
I'll be dead.

1677
01:27:35,895 --> 01:27:38,920
Yes, and when he's 20,
think how old I'll be.

1678
01:27:40,331 --> 01:27:42,525
Well, Oliver, is that the brat
you were talking about?

1679
01:27:42,599 --> 01:27:44,533
Yes, G. J.
This is Dr. Fulton.

1680
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:46,431
Don't you call
my husband names!

1681
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:48,994
Madam, what are you trying to put over
on the Oxly Chemical Works?

1682
01:27:49,105 --> 01:27:50,503
Stop talking like a fool.

1683
01:27:50,572 --> 01:27:52,437
I came here for help,
and you are responsible.

1684
01:27:52,474 --> 01:27:54,304
Jerome, you were
my husband's colleague.

1685
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:55,842
Can't you find an antidote?

1686
01:27:55,943 --> 01:27:57,432
I warned him. I warned him.

1687
01:27:57,544 --> 01:27:59,444
This proves there are
no boundaries to science.

1688
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:02,504
You're all talking nonsense.
That's no more Fulton than I am.

1689
01:28:02,614 --> 01:28:04,548
I ought to know
my own husband.

1690
01:28:04,616 --> 01:28:07,379
Now look what you've done.
You've made him cry.

1691
01:28:07,451 --> 01:28:09,680
That's all right, darling.
Don't cry.

1692
01:28:09,786 --> 01:28:12,846
- He's probably tired and sleepy.
- Yes. Sleepy?

1693
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:14,889
Well, that'd be a sign
that the formula's wearing off.

1694
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,390
That's the way
it worked with me.

1695
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:19,085
- Sleep might bring him to normalcy?
- It did before.

1696
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:22,322
- Oh, bosh.
- Mrs. Fulton, where are you taking him?

1697
01:28:22,396 --> 01:28:23,886
To his laboratory...

1698
01:28:23,997 --> 01:28:26,726
so that he can take a nap on his couch
where he'll feel at home.

1699
01:28:40,876 --> 01:28:42,810
Hey, look!

1700
01:28:42,878 --> 01:28:45,277
Oh, jiggers!
It's the cops!

1701
01:28:45,346 --> 01:28:48,577
Head for the hills!
Head for the hills!

1702
01:28:54,687 --> 01:28:57,382
<i>- Mr. Oxly, this is all I could...
- Shh!</i>

1703
01:28:57,455 --> 01:29:00,912
- This is all I could find.
- Give it to Mrs. Fulton.

1704
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:03,083
Mrs. Fulton, will this do?

1705
01:29:03,193 --> 01:29:05,422
Yes, thank you.

1706
01:29:05,461 --> 01:29:08,691
Oh, isn't he cute?

1707
01:29:08,763 --> 01:29:11,823
Miss Laurel. Keep your hands
off of him, please.

1708
01:29:11,933 --> 01:29:13,957
- I wasn't going to...
- He's defenseless.

1709
01:29:14,068 --> 01:29:17,901
<i>I can't have you touch him.
He's got to get some sleep.</i>

1710
01:29:17,971 --> 01:29:19,939
Yes, ma'am.

1711
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:24,674
He doesn't seem sleepy now.

1712
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:26,675
Perhaps we should take
a blood chemistry.

1713
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:29,075
Shh! Please.

1714
01:29:29,145 --> 01:29:32,205
Will you please be quiet
and give him a chance?

1715
01:29:32,314 --> 01:29:33,872
Yesterday when
he took the formula...

1716
01:29:33,983 --> 01:29:36,416
he had to sleep before
he became normal again.

1717
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:38,885
And he's got to sleep, Mr. Oxly.

1718
01:29:38,953 --> 01:29:41,921
Sometimes I try counting sheep.

1719
01:29:41,989 --> 01:29:44,855
Well, I hardly think he...

1720
01:29:44,924 --> 01:29:48,586
Oh. I know
what might do it.

1721
01:29:51,129 --> 01:29:54,586
Now. Now, listen, Barnaby.

1722
01:29:54,698 --> 01:29:57,461
#We're poor little lambs #

1723
01:29:57,533 --> 01:30:00,467
#Who have lost our way #

1724
01:30:00,535 --> 01:30:04,766
- # Baa baa baa #
- Silly song.

1725
01:30:04,872 --> 01:30:08,068
#We're little black sheep #

1726
01:30:08,141 --> 01:30:10,575
#Who have gone astray #

1727
01:30:10,644 --> 01:30:15,012
# Baa baa baa ##

1728
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:32,158
By George, this waiting
certainly takes it out of a man.

1729
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:34,160
I need something.

1730
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,195
Haven't got a drink around here,
have you, Doctor?

1731
01:30:36,295 --> 01:30:38,263
- But, Mr. Oxly, I don't drink.
- I didn't ask you that.

1732
01:30:38,331 --> 01:30:40,264
I asked you if you had
anything to drink around here.

1733
01:30:40,332 --> 01:30:41,560
Well, for medicinal purposes...

1734
01:30:41,633 --> 01:30:44,465
- No excuses. Just get it.
- Good idea.

1735
01:30:44,535 --> 01:30:46,469
- Here's some glasses.
- I'll get some water.

1736
01:30:46,537 --> 01:30:48,470
Yes, I'd like a little water
with mine.

1737
01:30:48,538 --> 01:30:51,439
- Will you have a drink, Mrs. Fulton?
- No, thank you.

1738
01:30:51,474 --> 01:30:53,907
<i>- A drink comes in handy sometimes.
- You bet.</i>

1739
01:30:53,976 --> 01:30:56,500
- Water, G. J.?
- Please. Thanks.

1740
01:30:56,611 --> 01:30:59,579
- Well, here's how.
- Here we go.

1741
01:31:06,552 --> 01:31:09,486
- Tastes kind of bitter, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it's strange.

1742
01:31:09,554 --> 01:31:11,851
<i>Get rid of that before
anyone else drinks it.</i>

1743
01:31:11,955 --> 01:31:13,855
- Yes, sir.
- I'll give you a hand.

1744
01:31:13,957 --> 01:31:16,151
<i>There's no excuse for having
water like that around here.</i>

1745
01:31:16,225 --> 01:31:19,194
<i>Doctor, see that that cooler's
cleaned out before it's used again.</i>

1746
01:31:19,262 --> 01:31:21,195
Yes, Mr. Oxly.

1747
01:31:43,479 --> 01:31:46,277
Well, who are you?
I don't care who you are.

1748
01:31:46,348 --> 01:31:48,713
Just-Just move over.
There's a good fellow.

1749
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:50,751
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

1750
01:31:58,391 --> 01:32:00,824
No, no, please. No familiarity.

1751
01:32:00,926 --> 01:32:03,018
Just-Just go to sleep.

1752
01:32:59,569 --> 01:33:02,129
Oh, Barnaby, darling.

1753
01:33:02,205 --> 01:33:04,434
Huh?
Oh, Edwina?

1754
01:33:04,507 --> 01:33:08,533
I thought I'd lost you,
and now there are two of you.

1755
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:10,543
What do you mean,
there are two of me?

1756
01:33:10,611 --> 01:33:12,841
L- I-I can't see.
My glasses, you know.

1757
01:33:12,913 --> 01:33:15,506
Oh, your glasses. Wait a minute.
Here they are, dear.

1758
01:33:15,581 --> 01:33:18,947
- Oh, dear me.
- Oh, darling, are you all right?

1759
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:21,109
- Yes, thank you. I'm all right.
- Here.

1760
01:33:21,186 --> 01:33:22,584
Who is this?

1761
01:33:22,653 --> 01:33:24,883
<i>I don't know.
I thought it was you.</i>

1762
01:33:24,955 --> 01:33:27,218
Well, what do you mean
you thought it was me?

1763
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:29,224
- I don't understand.
- Don't you remember?

1764
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:31,759
I carried you in here
when you were a baby.

1765
01:33:31,827 --> 01:33:34,954
- Oh, that's impossible.
- Well, don't you remember anything?

1766
01:33:35,062 --> 01:33:37,553
Well, sure.
The last thing I...

1767
01:33:37,632 --> 01:33:40,566
- I was scalping Hank Entwhistle.
- Oh, Barnaby.

1768
01:33:40,634 --> 01:33:42,567
<i>What's that?</i>

1769
01:33:42,635 --> 01:33:45,900
- I don't know.
- Hey, you'd better take this.

1770
01:33:45,971 --> 01:33:48,939
Yes.
Come on, sweetheart.

1771
01:33:49,007 --> 01:33:52,601
<i>We oughta find out who that is.</i>

1772
01:33:52,676 --> 01:33:54,700
Yes, indeed, we must.

1773
01:33:54,844 --> 01:33:57,937
<i>Dr. Fulton, I'm so glad.</i>

1774
01:34:00,148 --> 01:34:03,082
- What's going on?
- They've taken it. It was in the water.

1775
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:05,778
- What do you mean?
- The monkey mixed it.

1776
01:34:05,852 --> 01:34:09,344
<i>I'll get you!</i>

1777
01:34:09,422 --> 01:34:12,584
I can make a monkey out of Rudolph!
I'll get you!

1778
01:34:12,658 --> 01:34:15,421
<i>Oh, what a job you've done!</i>

1779
01:34:16,761 --> 01:34:19,285
No fair using hot water!

1780
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:21,296
Hello, Barnaby!
How are you, old boy?

1781
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:22,955
I knew you'd pull out of it.

1782
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:25,626
Here's a contract for you,
signed, sealed and delivered!

1783
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:27,895
You're a genius, old boy!

1784
01:34:27,969 --> 01:34:30,334
<i>- Hey!
- I'll get even!</i>

1785
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,933
You've got a fire hose there!
What's the idea?

1786
01:34:35,508 --> 01:34:38,442
<i>Get off of me!
You're drowning me!</i>

1787
01:34:38,510 --> 01:34:41,535
Oh, Miss Laurel!
Come on in and join the party!

1788
01:34:41,612 --> 01:34:43,739
- Come on in!
- Aah!

1789
01:34:43,814 --> 01:34:46,680
There he is!
There's the man who did it to me!

1790
01:34:46,749 --> 01:34:49,343
Mr. Oxly, please!
Aah!

1791
01:34:49,419 --> 01:34:51,648
Mr. Oxly, don't squirt me!

1792
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,657
Barnaby, can you hear me?

1793
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,284
<i>- Yes, dear.
- I've been thinking.</i>

1794
01:34:59,392 --> 01:35:01,518
Uh-huh.
I'm just beginning to.

1795
01:35:01,594 --> 01:35:04,825
I was wondering,
if I had my choice...

1796
01:35:04,897 --> 01:35:08,627
of living these
last three days over again...

1797
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:10,633
what I'd say.

1798
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:12,965
<i>Oh, let's hear it.
That interests me.</i>

1799
01:35:13,036 --> 01:35:14,969
Well, we've got a new contract...

1800
01:35:15,037 --> 01:35:17,231
we've had a lot of excitement...

1801
01:35:17,305 --> 01:35:21,071
and we're going out on the town
tonight, just the two of us.

1802
01:35:21,175 --> 01:35:23,166
<i>That's funny.
I can't hear you.</i>

1803
01:35:23,277 --> 01:35:25,870
I didn't say anything anyway.
I was just thinking.

1804
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:29,209
<i>- I was thinking about you.
- Care to elaborate on that?</i>

1805
01:35:29,281 --> 01:35:31,215
About your not
being disappointed...

1806
01:35:31,283 --> 01:35:33,876
when you found out that it
was Esther who'd invented the formula.

1807
01:35:33,985 --> 01:35:36,852
- Mm-hmm.
- Your suspenders would look better up.

1808
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:40,378
Imagine, the secret of youth,
locked up in the head of a monkey.

1809
01:35:40,457 --> 01:35:42,390
Do you think they'll ever
find out how to make it?

1810
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:45,858
I don't know.
They've got Esther working awfully hard.

1811
01:35:45,927 --> 01:35:48,395
Darling, why weren't
you disappointed?

1812
01:35:50,097 --> 01:35:52,088
Well, I've got a new formula.

1813
01:35:52,165 --> 01:35:54,928
Barnaby, if you start that
all over again, so help me, I'll...

1814
01:35:55,001 --> 01:35:57,230
Oh, I like that dress, yes.

1815
01:35:57,302 --> 01:35:59,019
- Oh, you do?
- Uh-huh.

1816
01:35:59,054 --> 01:36:02,079
All right,
what's the new formula?

1817
01:36:02,156 --> 01:36:05,886
Well, it doesn't come
in packages or bottles.

1818
01:36:05,992 --> 01:36:08,654
You're old only when
you forget you're young.

1819
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:10,786
- Come on, say some more.
- Hmm?

1820
01:36:10,863 --> 01:36:13,092
It's a word
you keep in your heart...

1821
01:36:13,164 --> 01:36:15,428
a light you have
in your eyes...

1822
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,433
someone you hold
in your arms.

1823
01:36:17,501 --> 01:36:20,595
My, I'm glad I'm going
out with you tonight.

1824
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:22,604
Come here.

1825
01:36:25,707 --> 01:36:28,903
- Do you like my formula?
- Mm-hmm.

1826
01:36:29,009 --> 01:36:32,137
Makes you think, doesn't it?

1827
01:36:32,212 --> 01:36:35,203
I can use a lot of that.

1828
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:38,375
What time did you
order the table?

1829
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:40,384
Hmm?
