1
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:18,192
Come on, get that sun lamp ready.

2
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:20,991
About 15 minutes is the most l'd advise,
Mr. Warriner.

3
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,495
Fifteen minutes nothing! l need
a deep Florida tan if it takes all afternoon.

4
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,046
Give her the gun.

5
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:30,417
All aboard for Miami,
Palm Beach and Point South.

6
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,717
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hello, Frank.

7
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:34,549
-How goes it?
-Fine!

8
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:37,133
-Like to play a little squash?
-No, thanks.

9
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:40,930
You're awfully white-skinned
for a guy who spent two weeks in Florida.

10
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:44,276
-That's what l thought.
-What did you do there, carry a parasol?

11
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:48,148
-Or didn't you go?
-Don't go spreading that around, Frank.

12
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:51,740
Pulling a fast one on the little wife?

13
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:55,912
Frank, l'm surprised at you.
l'm supposed to have been in Florida.

14
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,411
Supposing one of Lucy's friends
says to her:

15
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:01,378
''Well, why isn't he tanned?''
Lucy will be embarrassed.

16
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,877
l'll be tanned,
and Lucy won't be embarrassed.

17
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:08,102
What wives don't know won't hurt them.
What you don't know won't hurt you.

18
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:11,058
l don't want to know.
How about coming by the house?

19
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,521
Some friends are coming by
for a late breakfast.

20
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,443
l got a better idea. Come to my place
for eggnogs and breakfast...

21
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:20,617
and maybe later we can duck the women
and play some golf.

22
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:23,029
-Swell, boy, you got me convinced.
-Okay.

23
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:24,915
-See you later, Jerry.
-So long, Frank.

24
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:27,837
Come on in!

25
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:29,547
Hey, Lucy!

26
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,259
That man is here.

27
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:35,303
Maybe she wasn't expecting you.

28
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,724
No, she's around somewhere.
Put your things down anywhere.

29
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,725
-Hello, Celeste.
-Hello, Mr. Warriner, you look well.

30
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:44,354
Thank you, Celeste, and vice versa.

31
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:48,069
Where's Mrs. Warriner? Look what l got her
all the way from Florida.

32
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:50,114
-She's out.
-She's out?

33
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:55,245
Never mind. Go get some eggnogs,
and we'll find something to drink to.

34
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,207
Come on, gang, enter.

35
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:03,463
Mr. Smith, look who's here.

36
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:07,509
Come on, boy.

37
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,179
Where's Mamma?

38
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,809
Look, l've got something for you.

39
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,650
Come on, get it.

40
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,032
What are you doing, reading my mail?

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,740
Several letters there for your wife.
Yesterday's, too.

42
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:32,799
l hope Lucy comes back
looking as well as you do.

43
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:37,880
She's probably up at her Aunt Patsy's.
She always goes there when she's lonely.

44
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,765
Thank you, Celeste, l'll take it up from here.

45
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,313
-Jerry.
-What?

46
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,937
Supposing Aunt Patsy wasn't home?

47
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,147
l get it. l'm up to my neck in funny people!

48
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:54,110
Seriously, l wish Lucy would go out and
get some fun now and again. Do her good.

49
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:59,117
That's the trouble with marriages today.
People are always imagining things.

50
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:02,380
The road to Reno is paved with suspicions.

51
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,004
First thing you know,
they're in a divorce court.

52
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:08,049
The broad-minded man from the Rio Grande!

53
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,352
lf you think l'll get a chance to prove my
broad-mindedness any minute, you're crazy.

54
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:15,522
Lucy's up at her Aunt Patsy's cabin.
l'll bet on it.

55
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:19,192
lncidentally, what a swell spot that is.
Good fishing....

56
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,231
Sometimes, on a clear day across that lake,
you can see for....

57
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:34,841
Mrs. Barnsley, Miss Heath,
Mr. Barnsley, Mr. Randall.

58
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,426
Aunt Patsy.

59
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:46,561
Any idea where Lucy is?
You know, she invited me to this--

60
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,276
-Darling!
-Hello, dear!

61
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,488
How grand and brown you are!
Hello, Patsy, dear.

62
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,080
-Did you miss me? Been thinking about me?
-Look what l brought you!

63
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:03,205
All the way from Florida? Bless your heart!

64
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:09,008
You know Armand Duvalle, dear.

65
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:12,009
Come on in, Armand.

66
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,684
Mr. Duvalle, this is my aunt, Miss Adams.

67
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:18,478
Mr. and Mrs. Barnsley,
Miss Heath and Mr. Randall.

68
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,526
We've had the most terrible time.

69
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,365
Armand's car broke down last night
miles from nowhere...

70
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,745
and we had to stay at the nastiest inn ever.
No modern conveniences. lt was dreadful!

71
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,781
We were coming home from the junior prom.
Armand's pupil invited us.

72
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:35,828
Oh, it's a long story, but l must....
Hello, there!

73
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:39,586
Your wife, she was the loveliest woman
in the party.

74
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:42,254
Armand, you always say the nicest things.

75
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,224
lsn't that cute? Did you bring him that?

76
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,185
-Yes--
-Go catch it!

77
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,649
-Were you disappointed l wasn't here?
-Not at all. After all, you didn't expect me.

78
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:56,614
And you'll forgive me
for my car's imperfect performance?

79
00:05:56,911 --> 00:06:00,780
Of course.
l'm sorry the inn was so inconvenient.

80
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,128
That's the only thing that bothers me.

81
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:08,089
You know, your husband
is not like the average American man.

82
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:11,095
He's free of all mean suspicion.

83
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:14,634
He has more the Continental mind. Yes?

84
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:18,429
That's right, l have a Continental mind.
Will you have an eggnog?

85
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:19,899
Thank you.

86
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,365
l don't know what kind of a mind Jerry's got,
Continental or cockeyed...

87
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,742
but he's a wonder.
Now, if l stayed out all night...

88
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:36,703
and waltzed in with handsome Mr. Duvalle,
and said the car broke down....

89
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:40,002
lt did. Why should Jerry be angry?
l didn't build the car.

90
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:43,262
-You're perfectly right, dear.
-Of course l am.

91
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,553
Can't have a happy married life
if you're always suspicious.

92
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:48,104
Right again.

93
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:50,432
-A little nutmeg?
-Please.

94
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:55,113
-Why am l boring you with private matters?
-We're not bored.

95
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:58,817
No one's interested in my adventure
but Jerry, who knows it's innocent...

96
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:03,041
just as well as he knows
that he just got back from Florida.

97
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:06,669
l see what you mean.

98
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:11,177
More drinks, everybody? There's lots left.

99
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:15,640
-No, thank you, l think we better be going.
-You don't all have to go, do you?

100
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,726
Go? No.

101
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,893
-Well, it's silly to go so soon.
-We must go, really.

102
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,771
Patsy, dear, where are you going?
l haven't even had a chance to talk to you.

103
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:29,108
l'll see you later, my dear.

104
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:31,990
l always say four's a crowd.

105
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,157
There's something in what she says.

106
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,303
Thank you.

107
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:48,426
-Say, are you hungry?
-To tell you the truth, l'm starved.

108
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,893
Why don't you go out and grab a bite?

109
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:55,941
-A strong fellow should take care of himself.
-Why, what have l done?

110
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:59,110
-lf you speak of last night, l assure you--
-You don't believe--

111
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:01,111
We'll discuss it in private.

112
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:05,155
That is if Mr. Duvalle can remember
where we keep our door.

113
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:09,202
ln all fairness, you should permit me
to remain and explain ourselves.

114
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:11,790
American women
aren't accustomed to gallantry.

115
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:14,637
l appreciate your offer,
but maybe you'd better go.

116
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:17,130
Pardon me, Mrs. Warriner,
you misunderstand.

117
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,634
l am a voice teacher, am l not?

118
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:24,938
For one year she has been my pupil.
And from time to time, l pat her on the back.

119
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:28,232
l mean, l congratulate her on her...

120
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,658
-development.
-ls that so?

121
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,449
-Do l express myself?
-You've been doing all right.

122
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:38,162
But now my position must be considered.
l have never yet been in a scandal.

123
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:40,294
-Never been caught?
-No.

124
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,967
l am a great teacher, not a great lover.

125
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:48,224
That's right, Armand, no one could ever
accuse you of being a great lover.

126
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:52,142
That is, l mean to say,
who's to say whether you are or not?

127
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,399
lt's all so silly!
But maybe you had better go.

128
00:08:56,486 --> 00:09:00,949
-l really don't know what to say.
-lf you go, you won't have to say anything.

129
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:04,736
-Perhaps it is best this way, Mrs. Warriner.
-l think so.

130
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,200
-l will see you soon?
-Yes.

131
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,453
lt has been all so perfect.

132
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:13,208
Thank you for everything.

133
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:14,795
Take another bow.

134
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:17,805
Not a bad performance
considering no rehearsals or anything.

135
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,343
Why, Mr. Warriner,
you're out of your Continental mind.

136
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:30,104
That was funny, what he said
about your Continental mind.

137
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:34,988
-No doubt he has a better sense of humour.
-No, l beg to differ.

138
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,370
Right now you're twice as funny as him.

139
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,292
-Quit stalling, Lucy.
-l'm not--

140
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,371
Perhaps our marriage means nothing to you.

141
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:45,130
Perhaps you have no sentiment left for me.
Look at this.

142
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:51,560
Look, a letter l wrote you.
Did you care when you read it? No!

143
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:54,934
You knew there'd be a letter
every morning...

144
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:58,394
but you were far too busy
with Armand Duvalle to give it a thought.

145
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:00,813
lt's enough to destroy one's faith, isn't it?

146
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,441
l haven't any faith left in anyone.

147
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:06,827
l know just how you feel.

148
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:09,291
What do you mean?

149
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,801
You didn't mention in any of your letters
the terrible rainy spell in Florida.

150
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:24,100
The papers were full of it.

151
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,811
-l can explain that, Lucy.
-You can?

152
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:33,317
Don't try to change the subject.
You think a great offence is a great defence.

153
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:36,660
Don't try to justify your behaviour
by insinuating things about me.

154
00:10:36,747 --> 00:10:39,749
l haven't any behaviour to justify.
l've just been unlucky.

155
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,374
You caught me in a truth, and it seems
there's nothing less logical than the truth.

156
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:46,791
-A philosopher?
-You don't believe me.

157
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,128
How can l believe you?
''The car broke down.''

158
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:51,511
People stopped believing that ages ago.

159
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:54,050
-His car's very old.
-So is his story.

160
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,851
-Let me tell you something.
-Let me tell you something.

161
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,515
l told you the truth about all this, Jerry.

162
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,648
Don't you see?
There can't be any doubt in marriage.

163
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,035
The whole thing's built on faith.
lf you've lost that, you've lost everything.

164
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:09,577
When that's gone
the marriage is washed up.

165
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,374
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

166
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,667
-Then that settles it.
-l guess it does.

167
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:17,042
l wouldn't go on living with you
if you were dipped in platinum.

168
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,128
So divorce me. lt'll be a pleasure.

169
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,014
You think l'd drag that music lover to court
to show people the man you preferred?

170
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:27,519
Then l'll divorce you.
lt's customary for the wife to bring suit.

171
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:30,686
lt has something to do
with the husband being a gentleman.

172
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,691
Just get on with the divorce proceedings.
l can't wait.

173
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:36,570
-l'll call our lawyer right now.
-All right, here.

174
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:41,118
You don't mind? l don't know anyone else.
You get around much more than l do.

175
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,668
ls that so?

176
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,508
Hello?

177
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,551
Hello, Lucy.

178
00:11:54,268 --> 00:11:55,727
What's that?

179
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:58,184
Divorce? You and Jerry?

180
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:03,193
Don't do anything in haste
you might regret later.

181
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,361
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
-Can't she call back after we've eaten?

182
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:09,576
Please be quiet, will you?

183
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:13,786
You seem agitated, Lucy.
Try and calm yourself.

184
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:17,579
l'd hate to see you take any hasty action
in a matter like this.

185
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:20,546
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
-Finish your meal.

186
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:24,422
-Why can't they call you back later?
-Will you shut your mouth?

187
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:27,971
As l was saying, Lucy,
marriage is a beautiful thing.

188
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:31,480
When you've been married as long as l,
you'll appreciate it, too.

189
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:35,021
Your food's getting ice-cold.
You always complain about your food.

190
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:38,366
Just shut your big mouth.
l'll eat when l'm good and ready.

191
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:42,321
lf you don't like it,
you know what you can do. So shut up!

192
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:46,203
Marriage is a beautiful thing.

193
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,553
You see? Because you were a naughty dog,
they made you leave the room. Come on.

194
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,231
<i>ln the case of Warriner v. Warriner,
the court grants...</i>

195
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:04,900
an interlocutory decree of divorce
in favour of the plaintiff, Lucy Warriner.

196
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:08,939
The divorce, without further contesting,
will become final 90 days from this day.

197
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:13,580
Plaintiff and defendant then have the liberty
to make other marriages, if they so desire.

198
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,834
Your Honour, there's a matter still unsettled.

199
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,916
-The matter about....
-Mr. Smith.

200
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,928
-Yes, Your Honour, Mr. Smith.
-Who is Mr. Smith?

201
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:27,431
-Mr. Smith is their dog.
-No, Mr. Smith is my dog.

202
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:29,844
-ls that so?
-Silence!

203
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:32,774
But, you see, Mr. Smith belongs to me,
and she has him.

204
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,651
Very well, go ahead.

205
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:37,026
The animal is in Mrs. Warriner's possession.

206
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:40,817
You ordered him from the courtroom
at the beginning, for contempt.

207
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:44,993
-Mr. Warriner wishes to have him because....
-Because he's mine!

208
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:47,077
-He is not.
-He is, too.

209
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:49,122
-He is not.
-Silence!

210
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:51,920
ls not.

211
00:13:53,637 --> 00:13:56,805
Mrs. Warriner, step up and tell me
why you regard the dog...

212
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:00,890
as your personal property, so the court
may decide if he should remain with you.

213
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,270
Nothing would please me more.

214
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,441
Your Honour, l saw Mr. Smith first.

215
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,650
lt was in that pet shop on Madison Avenue.
You know it?

216
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:14,204
-You don't? lt's between 47th and....
-lt's frightfully immaterial.

217
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,792
Well, you ought to know.
l decided to buy Mr. Smith...

218
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,543
but l turned away for a moment
to look at a Persian kitten. Do you like cats?

219
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:28,430
l don't either. So l turned around again,
and this man had Mr. Smith in his arms.

220
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:33,228
l said, ''Pardon me, l'm buying this puppy.''
And then he just smiled at me.

221
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:36,483
Then somehow, suddenly,
the three of us were having lunch...

222
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,403
the man, and Mr. Smith, and l.
And then things happened swiftly...

223
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:42,948
so l said, ''We'd better get married,''
and we did.

224
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:46,787
That way we could give Mr. Smith
a better home and live happily ever after.

225
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,952
-Until now.
-l see.

226
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:51,830
ln these custody cases, Mrs. Warriner...

227
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,626
we often allow the final decision
to rest with the party in question.

228
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,513
You mean Mr. Smith?

229
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,807
Send for the dog.

230
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:04,932
Custody of the dog
will depend on his own desire.

231
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:10,526
-Mr. Warriner, will you step up here, please?
-Yes, Your Honour.

232
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,162
Unfasten him.

233
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,674
You may each call the dog.

234
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:29,096
-Mr. Smith, come on, boy.
-Smitty, look up here.

235
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:38,397
Don't pay attention. Come on, boy.

236
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:41,442
Look up here. You know me.

237
00:15:45,705 --> 00:15:48,623
-Smitty, look up here.
-No, don't!

238
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:54,001
l win.

239
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:57,135
Custody of the dog
is awarded to Mrs. Warriner.

240
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,054
Your Honour, that's not quite fair.
l ought to see the dog twice a month or so.

241
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:02,934
-l'll take it under advisement.
-Goodbye.

242
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,143
Thank you. Goodbye.

243
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,310
Goodbye, Your Honour.

244
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:12,818
-You won't forget to do that, Judge?
-l'll take it under advisement.

245
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:14,985
Yes, but when will you know?

246
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:24,662
Look at that rain!

247
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:28,756
-Why, is it doing anything besides falling?
-l don't think so.

248
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,801
Nothing unusual ever happens around here.

249
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:35,181
Patsy, l'm sorry you're so bored tonight.

250
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:38,227
Why tonight? l've been bored for a month.

251
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:42,987
lf l'd known we'd be buried side by side
l'd never have taken this apartment.

252
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:47,369
l wouldn't have asked you to come
and live with me if l'd known that...

253
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:51,323
a sort of readjustment
takes place after divorce.

254
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:56,166
Readjustment my foot!
That's just another word for moping around.

255
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,800
Don't be silly.
Anyhow, where can two women go alone?

256
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:03,970
You know dozens of men
who'd turn handsprings to take you out.

257
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,225
l've got you all dressed up, ready to go out,
and you weaken and refuse.

258
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,144
You're just an old grouch.

259
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:13,321
l want to go where there's life.
And l don't mean plant life.

260
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:15,198
l want to go to the theatre.

261
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,369
You know, go places later
and step around and do things.

262
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,492
-But you can't go in all this rain.
-Why not, no taxis?

263
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,168
No escort.

264
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:27,128
Unless there's a new ruling,
l don't need an escort to get a drink.

265
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:29,673
l'm going down to the bar and see Joe.

266
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:32,764
Bartender or no bartender, he's still a man.

267
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:35,721
-Maybe he knocks off early.
-Patsy, you wouldn't!

268
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:38,766
l wouldn't?
You're talking to a desperate woman.

269
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,474
Hello, Smitty, come on up, boy.

270
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,696
-lsn't he cute?
-Too bad he can't wear a top hat.

271
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:50,613
Did you hear what she said?

272
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:30,126
-l wonder if you'd do me a favour?
-Well, of course, that all depends.

273
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:52,033
lmagine you living right across the hall
from us all of this time.

274
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:55,575
l think it's just wonderful
that we've met this way.

275
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:06,220
Lucy, may l present Mr. Leeson?

276
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:10,058
This is my niece you wanted to meet.
Her name is Lucy Warriner.

277
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,224
How do you do?

278
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,559
-Won't you sit down?
-Thanks.

279
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,488
Mr. Leeson's just from Oklahoma, Lucy.
He's a stranger in town.

280
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:24,121
He'd take it as real neighbourly of us
if we show him some of the bright spots.

281
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,126
He would?

282
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:29,037
lt's raining awfully hard. l don't think--

283
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:33,629
That's just exactly what l said,
''l don't think the rain will stop us.''

284
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,925
Besides, l think it'll let up in a few minutes,
Miss Warriner.

285
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:40,766
Mr. Leeson's a neighbour.
He lives across the hall with his mother.

286
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:43,477
-That's what you said, right?
-Yes, with my mother.

287
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,940
We're here on a visit. l'm in oil, you know.

288
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:47,821
Marinated, so to speak.

289
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:54,529
Say, that's a good one!
l got to remember to tell that to my mother.

290
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,291
Mr. Leeson, won't you tell us
something about Oklahoma?

291
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:01,373
Oklahoma's pretty swell.

292
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:06,636
l got quite a ranch down there.
Like you to see it sometime, Miss Warriner.

293
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:09,476
l don't get out there very....

294
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:14,523
l got cattle and horses
and chickens and alfalfa and--

295
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,538
-Hello, Jerry.
-Patsy, how are things?

296
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:26,789
-We weren't expecting you.
-Why, what goes on?

297
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:34,003
Hiya, fellow! Mr. Smith, how have you been?

298
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:36,550
l'll see you in a minute, boy. Yeah, sure.

299
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:39,047
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Lucy.

300
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:41,052
What might you be doing here?

301
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:43,981
Have you forgotten
this is my day to visit Mr. Smith?

302
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:46,105
lt says so right there.

303
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,701
l'm so sorry.
Mr. Leeson, this is my husband.

304
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:59,702
He's only my husband for,
how much longer is it now, 60 days?

305
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:02,963
-Fifty-nine.
-That's better, only 59 days.

306
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:06,591
And don't worry about him,
he has a Continental mind.

307
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:12,720
-Excuse me, what did you say?
-l'm glad to know you.

308
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,640
How can you be glad to know me?

309
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,184
l know how l'd feel if l was with a girl
and her husband walked in.

310
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,939
l'll bet you do.

311
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:24,155
l don't think you ought to go around
telling people you're not married.

312
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:26,701
He looks a nice fellow.
How do you think he feels?

313
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:31,702
-Why don't you go play with the dog?
-You go on with whatever you were doing.

314
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:33,339
Don't mind me.

315
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:42,010
Any new dogs in the neighbourhood?
Been chasing any cats?

316
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,012
Sit down, Mr. Leeson.

317
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:47,142
-Tell me some more about Arizona.
-Oklahoma.

318
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,444
l mean Oklahoma. That's me for you!

319
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:55,781
ls he getting enough to eat lately?
He doesn't look well.

320
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,243
You don't look so hot yourself.

321
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:06,050
l don't think he's getting enough exercise.
He's got circles under his eyes.

322
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,845
-The court ruled--
-What about a tune, boy?

323
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:18,858
Yes. You see,
there's nothing we can do about it.

324
00:22:19,736 --> 00:22:22,607
Don't worry about it, Mr. Leeson.
Go right ahead.

325
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,284
-My main business is oil.
-Oil?

326
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:38,373
Sing it!

327
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:44,223
l do pretty well.

328
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,023
l have a ranch. My hobby is horses.

329
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:50,223
Hobby horses!

330
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,956
Come on, let's get out of here.

331
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:12,762
-Goodbye, Jerry.
-Goodbye, Warriner.

332
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:27,652
What's the matter?

333
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:31,370
-Are you sure you don't like that fellow?
-Like him!

334
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:35,124
-You saw how l treated him, didn't you?
-That's what l mean.

335
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:39,378
On my ranch l got a little red rooster
and a little brown hen...

336
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,841
and they fight all the time, too.

337
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,309
But once in a while, they make up again,
and they're right friendly.

338
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:56,730
-'Morning, Ma.
-Well? lt was daylight when you came in.

339
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:58,818
l had a wonderful time. l met a girl--

340
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:01,830
That's what l thought.
You keep your mind off women.

341
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,114
l can't, Ma.

342
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,961
You can't?
That's what your father always said.

343
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:10,042
Of course l like Dan Leeson. Why not?
He's sweet and thoughtful.

344
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:13,505
You should be the last one to object,
you introduced him to me.

345
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:17,679
He was a man who could take us out.
l didn't expect you to get silly about him.

346
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,105
There's nothing wrong in liking a man
who's sane and considerate.

347
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:23,944
l was married to one
who was insane and inconsiderate.

348
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:25,938
Your toast is burning.

349
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:28,567
-What's her name?
-Lucy Warriner.

350
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,238
Probably an alias.

351
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:33,117
You'll laugh for talking that way
when you meet Lucy.

352
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:37,041
She won't want to meet me. She knows
any woman could see through her.

353
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:39,882
Don't talk that way about Lucy.
l'm crazy about her.

354
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:43,426
l believe she kind of likes me, too.
l think l'm in love.

355
00:24:43,513 --> 00:24:45,091
Do you know what rebound is?

356
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:49,644
Trying to get over one love
by bouncing into love with somebody else.

357
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:53,812
lt's fine, except the rebound is rarely
the real thing. ln fact, it's the bunk.

358
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:57,189
There's the first bounce, the second, and....
Well, look at me.

359
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,654
You wind up like an old tennis ball.

360
00:24:59,743 --> 00:25:03,196
l'm serious about Dan Leeson.
l like him very much.

361
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:05,538
l'm all through with Jerry,
he means nothing.

362
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:08,332
l don't love him, and l probably never did.

363
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:12,919
l'm sure l never loved him. Now l hate him.
That surprises you, doesn't it?

364
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,585
l hate Jerry Warriner
and l like Dan Leeson very much.

365
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,016
l hope he's crazy about me,
because he's the finest man l've met.

366
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:21,345
l know, my toast is burning.

367
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:35,657
You're awful sweet and all that,
but your mind's always on something else.

368
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,788
Or maybe someone else. ls it, sugar pie?

369
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:41,038
No, l'm in love with love.

370
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:45,919
''ln the spring,
a young man's fancy lightly turns to''...

371
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:49,386
what he's been thinking about all winter.

372
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:52,100
How long have you talked
like Amos and Andy?

373
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:53,814
For quite some time.

374
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:56,818
l got wise to the fact
that it helps me in my work.

375
00:25:56,904 --> 00:26:01,614
So, as long as l work,
you'll have to pardon my Southern accent.

376
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:07,490
Well, shut my mouth,
who's that gorgeous-looking creature?

377
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,672
Have you heard that gag
that's been flying around town?

378
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:18,757
''Who was that lady l saw you with?''

379
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,102
You mean, that's no lady, that's your wife?

380
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:38,161
l like this place best
of all the spots l've been to.

381
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:41,621
-You do?
-Maybe it's because l'm so happy.

382
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:45,380
-Just think of it, Lucy. You'll be my wife.
-Yes, l am thinking of it.

383
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:49,135
l've hoped for it
ever since that first night l met you.

384
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:52,221
l can hardly wait for your final decree
to come along.

385
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:54,269
lt'll come along, Dan.

386
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:57,982
lncidentally,
here's my husband coming along.

387
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:04,492
-Hello, folks.
-Hello.

388
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:06,073
This is Dixie Belle Lee.

389
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:10,792
This is Mrs. Warriner, and Mr. Leeson,
the gentleman Mrs. Warriner will marry.

390
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:14,046
-lt's mighty fine meeting you.
-Now come along.

391
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,179
Now, you're sure we're not intruding?

392
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,349
-What do you mean?
-Wouldn't you like us to have a drink?

393
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:24,520
-Yes, of course.
-Sit down.

394
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,695
My, isn't this cosy?

395
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:45,875
So, you two are going to be married.

396
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:51,046
l was glad to hear that. l said to myself,
''That Leeson's just the man for Lucy.''

397
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:55,345
-Then l said to myself--
-He's always talking to himself.

398
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:58,226
-lsn't this a charming place?
-Do you really like it?

399
00:27:58,317 --> 00:28:01,105
l'm so glad.
l almost feel like the place is mine.

400
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:04,981
-You come here often?
-l work here, didn't you know that?

401
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:06,156
No.

402
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:08,452
You're from the South, aren't you?

403
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:12,538
Well, now isn't he just the cleverest gent?
How'd y'all ever guess that?

404
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:15,749
l don't know, it was just a shot in the dark.

405
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:18,750
But Dixie Belle Lee isn't her real name.

406
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:21,337
-No?
-No, she changed it, you see...

407
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:25,265
because her family objected
to her going into show business.

408
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:29,768
My folks thought l was going to the dogs
when l decided to go to work.

409
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,064
l'm sure you'll be a big success,
and then they'll be proud of you.

410
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:37,072
Thank you. lt's real nice of you to say that.
l'd better go now and get ready.

411
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:39,777
-Can you stay and see my act?
-We'll stay.

412
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:43,250
-Nothing could drag us away.
-See you later, then.

413
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:49,214
-She seems like a nice girl.
-lndeed.

414
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:53,765
Enough about Dixie Belle for the moment.
Let's talk about yourselves.

415
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:57,596
So you're going to live in Oklahoma, Lucy?
How l envy you.

416
00:28:57,689 --> 00:29:02,317
Ever since l was a small boy
that name has been filled with magic for me.

417
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:03,905
Oklahoma.

418
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:08,619
We're going to live right in Oklahoma City.

419
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:10,780
Not Oklahoma City itself?

420
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,709
Lucy, you lucky girl.

421
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,715
No more running around the nightspots.

422
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,718
No more prowling around
in New York shops.

423
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:24,347
l'll think of you whenever a show opens
and say to myself:

424
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,094
''She's well out of it.''

425
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:29,887
New York's all right for a visit,
but l wouldn't want to live here.

426
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:32,439
l know l'll enjoy Oklahoma City.

427
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,823
Of course. lf it gets dull,
you can always go to Tulsa for the weekend.

428
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:42,781
l think a big change
like that does one good.

429
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,370
That's right.

430
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:50,043
l know this isn't quite the place,
but Lucy tells me you two own a coal mine.

431
00:29:50,176 --> 00:29:51,208
What about it?

432
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:56,013
Yes. Mr. Leeson thought that maybe
he'd like to buy your interest.

433
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:58,303
That is, if the price is right.

434
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,398
l was telling Mr. Leeson, l mean Daniel...

435
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:07,024
about how badly we were doing,
and he thought maybe he could do better.

436
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,236
l suppose you told him
there wasn't any coal in it, too.

437
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:16,079
Well, if you're interested,
you might bring around the data tomorrow.

438
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:17,831
l'm very lucky.

439
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:21,087
You know what they call me back home?

440
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:23,804
l can guess.

441
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,382
l just met her.

442
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,695
l guess it was easier for her
to change her name...

443
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:19,709
than for a whole family to change theirs.

444
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:22,873
That'd go great out West.

445
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:26,844
Seemed to go pretty well
with the cowboy here.

446
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,839
You want to change the subject?

447
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:33,469
Why don't you two get up and dance?
Or don't you dance?

448
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:36,311
Lucy doesn't care much about dancing.

449
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,275
Didn't you know that?

450
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:45,530
Did Lucy tell you that? She's holding out
on you. She's a beautiful dancer.

451
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:49,122
Why, l used to call her ''Twinkle Toes.''
Hello, Twinkle Toes.

452
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:51,535
Have you been fooling me, you little rascal?

453
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:54,667
Honestly, l didn't think
you cared much about it.

454
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:58,045
Care about it?
Why, l could dance till the cows come home.

455
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:00,546
l won several cups at it myself.

456
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,676
We never won any cups.

457
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:06,603
Maybe you had the wrong partner.

458
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:09,268
There's a lot in what you say.

459
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,152
-Can l have this waltz, Lucy?
-Of course.

460
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:43,362
Here, give this to the orchestra leader
and tell him...

461
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:46,402
-to play the same number again.
-Yes, sir.

462
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:46,770
Come on, sing.

463
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:53,999
lt's ''all day.''

464
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,578
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

465
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:33,835
-Not bad.
-Thanks.

466
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:36,088
-Never had a lesson in my life.
-You don't say.

467
00:36:36,182 --> 00:36:38,590
-Have you?
-Well, yes.

468
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:42,020
Let's sing another one.
That must be him now.

469
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,018
-Hello, Warriner.
-Hello, Leeson.

470
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:50,030
-Hello, Lucy.
-Hello, Jerry.

471
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:52,819
-Glad you dropped up.
-Thanks.

472
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:56,793
l really am very interested
in that mine of yours.

473
00:36:56,876 --> 00:37:00,377
Yes, l brought along all the records
and history of....

474
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,042
l've looked all over for McCall's report
on that mine.

475
00:37:04,136 --> 00:37:07,138
-l can't find it anywhere. You must have it.
-Maybe l have.

476
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:11,009
Next chance you get,
look through your stocking drawer.

477
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:14,391
She always hides important things
in the top drawer of her dresser.

478
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:15,764
She does?

479
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,988
Every legal paper we had smelled of sachet.

480
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:21,273
lt did?

481
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:25,279
Even the marriage certificate.

482
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:30,161
Remember when the clerk asked to see it
and you couldn't find it?

483
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:33,957
We had a bunch of pals at the hotel.
They kept ribbing us all night.

484
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:39,224
Remember when they sent the bellboy?
We didn't want ice water.

485
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:42,635
No?

486
00:37:47,486 --> 00:37:49,111
What's the matter?

487
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:53,943
When you two are married
the three of us can talk more freely.

488
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:55,948
About this mine business...

489
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,706
this place was formerly owned
by the Fullerton Brothers. They....

490
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:09,422
You've heard of the Fullerton Brothers,
haven't you?

491
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:10,548
Yes.

492
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:14,262
lt seems they didn't know much
about the mining situation in Pennsylvania.

493
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:16,978
-Their racket was mainly--
-Why, hello, Ma!

494
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:20,611
-Hello.
-Hello, Mrs. Leeson.

495
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,569
-Hello, Lucy.
-Ma, this is Mr. Jerry Warriner.

496
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,903
-Not--
-Yes, ma'am, that's right.

497
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:29,367
-We're discussing a business proposition.
-l see.

498
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:32,458
-lt's funny seeing you.
-lt is?

499
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:35,042
Well, it's funny seeing you.

500
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:39,009
What l mean is, l was at a tea this afternoon
where some people...

501
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:41,969
were speaking of you and of Lucy, too.

502
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:45,389
They knew you both before the divorce.

503
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:51,442
l'll bet you run into dozens of people
who knew us before the divorce.

504
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,410
Yes, we used to get around quite a lot.
Didn't we?

505
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,083
They spoke very well of you.
They said you were a real gentleman.

506
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:02,208
Oh, did they really?

507
00:39:02,462 --> 00:39:05,085
And they were talking of Lucy, too.

508
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,172
You know, you do sing divinely, dear.

509
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,846
But l'd never realised till this afternoon
that you had a teacher...

510
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,686
and a very handsome one, l understand.

511
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:21,103
There was a woman there, if l hadn't been
a lady l would have slapped her face.

512
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:24,613
-Why didn't you?
-l wish l had, because she insinuated....

513
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:28,528
As a matter of fact,
she didn't even insinuate.

514
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:32,498
Well, she was talking
about your divorcing Mr. Warriner.

515
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,709
She came right out and said
that it should have been....

516
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:44,473
No matter, no matter.

517
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,353
-No matter.
-No matter.

518
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:51,899
Let's get down to business, Leeson.

519
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:56,024
lf l'd had time to work this mine myself,
l'd have made a fortune.

520
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:59,322
But l was always too busy
making money for other people.

521
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:02,665
There's a section up there
simply crying for someone to go in...

522
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:05,042
who has the time and money to give it.

523
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:09,750
l think if you could sink a shaft
in this north corner, right about here....

524
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:11,846
Wait, let me show you something.

525
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:15,218
l ought to tell you, Jerry,
nobody is listening to you.

526
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:17,802
The girl's name needs clearing, partner.

527
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,937
l wouldn't go so far as to say that.

528
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:24,528
But l'm sure Mr. Warriner
is pleased at the opportunity...

529
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:27,237
to deny that silly story
l heard this afternoon.

530
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:30,448
Why, certainly, Mrs. Leeson. What is it?

531
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:36,630
This woman said Mr. Warriner permitted you
to bring proceedings so that....

532
00:40:37,424 --> 00:40:40,758
Well, so that your reputation
wouldn't be ruined.

533
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:43,847
There, it's out. l know it's silly but--

534
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,092
Of course it's silly, and so are you.

535
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:48,013
-What?
-See here, Warriner.

536
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:51,890
l mean it's silly for your mother
to believe such nonsense.

537
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:57,112
You see, our divorce was one of those
tragedies that you read about in the papers.

538
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:00,703
A trusting woman and a worthless man.

539
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:05,706
l was never good enough for Lucy
and finally she found it out.

540
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:08,750
Lucy is above suspicion,
and always has been.

541
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:13,552
She's as pure as the driven snow,
as faithful as she is fair.

542
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:18,719
And l would that l had been worthy
to kiss the hem of her garment.

543
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:22,391
Never during our marital bliss
did she cause me a moment's uneasiness.

544
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:26,484
Never did l have to ask, ''Lucy, where
have you been, what were you doing?''

545
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:27,949
l always knew.

546
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:33,202
l tell you, something wonderful
went out of my life when l lost her.

547
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,913
-l know just how you feel.
-How do you know?

548
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:40,465
How can you know how it feels to have
used up the best years of a woman's life?

549
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,558
Of course, that's the way it goes.

550
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:52,399
Excuse me, you're sitting on my prospectus.

551
00:41:54,736 --> 00:41:58,570
Dan, take those and look them over.

552
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:01,200
And let me know. And, Dan...

553
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:03,407
take good care of her.

554
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,500
l'll be going now.

555
00:42:09,923 --> 00:42:12,047
Yes, Dan, take good care of her.

556
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:14,799
Maybe you'll succeed where l failed.

557
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:20,851
l'm sure that the three of you will be
very happy out where the West begins.

558
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,523
lf you ever think of me, send me a postcard.

559
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:29,942
Just say, ''Having a wonderful time.''
l'll understand.

560
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:36,530
Goodbye, now.

561
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,510
Ma, are you convinced about everything?

562
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:48,012
What about the music teacher?

563
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:53,220
You two try and settle things for yourselves.
Let me know how it comes out.

564
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:56,187
Put a light in the window if it's yes,
two if it's no.

565
00:42:56,278 --> 00:42:59,529
And if you can't make up your minds,
just pull down the shade.

566
00:43:21,562 --> 00:43:22,641
Hello.

567
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,815
What are you doing in my apartment,
if l'm not too inquisitive?

568
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:28,986
l thought after my swell reference
about you, l deserved a drink.

569
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:32,240
-Wish l'd mixed it for you.
-l see what you mean.

570
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,496
Certainly do appreciate
all the charming things you said about me.

571
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:40,585
When l get the chance,
l hope l can do as much for you.

572
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,245
lt was nothing at all.
l try to go through life--

573
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:46,462
l know,
spreading a little sunshine as you go.

574
00:43:47,346 --> 00:43:50,052
No, frankly, l was worried about you.

575
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:54,473
You've never asked for money.
Do you need any?

576
00:43:54,564 --> 00:43:57,732
No, l think l can struggle along
without any help from you.

577
00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:00,108
l thought maybe you made
a bad investment.

578
00:44:00,197 --> 00:44:03,733
-No. l only made one bad investment.
-Don't bite me.

579
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:08,617
l thought that maybe Buffalo Bill's millions
might have something to do--

580
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:10,287
Nothing to do with anything.

581
00:44:10,377 --> 00:44:13,249
Millions or no millions,
he's a very charming person.

582
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,585
l've seen him.

583
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:19,043
l can't possibly interpret this as jealousy.

584
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:20,302
No.

585
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:24,306
l've come out from behind those clouds.

586
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:27,436
l've taken a definite turn for the better.

587
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:29,940
Nothing's going to hurt me anymore.

588
00:44:33,325 --> 00:44:35,235
That's too bad, Jerry.

589
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:37,868
-Did it hurt you much?
-No.

590
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,662
-Just the one hand?
-Just the one hand.

591
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,041
l'll be going.
l always like to leave people laughing.

592
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:47,173
ls there anything l can get you for it?

593
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,931
No, l'm a stout fellow, l'll carry on.

594
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:54,348
-Where's Mr. Smith?
-Out with Aunt Patsy.

595
00:44:57,065 --> 00:44:59,391
Tell me something before l go, will you?

596
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:02,697
-What do you see in this fellow?
-None of your business.

597
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:07,528
Not that l care, but what kind of a line
could he have that would impress you?

598
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,537
You might be surprised. You could take
a few lessons and profit nicely.

599
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:14,956
You'd be surprised what l'd give
to get an earful of that.

600
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:17,207
-You would.
-l couldn't wait to see you.

601
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:20,054
l had to tell you
how awful l feel about what happened.

602
00:45:20,138 --> 00:45:22,974
You'll have to forgive Ma.
She's kind of old-fashioned.

603
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:25,467
-l'll forgive her.
-You won't hold it against her?

604
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:28,648
No. Now you go and dress for dinner.
We'll be very late.

605
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:30,686
l'm a lot quicker than you are.

606
00:45:30,777 --> 00:45:34,064
Just to prove that you're not mad,
will you give me a little kiss?

607
00:45:34,157 --> 00:45:37,408
-Right here in the hall? Don't be silly.
-There's nobody around.

608
00:45:37,495 --> 00:45:40,248
-You never can tell if someone's around.
-l'll come in.

609
00:45:40,332 --> 00:45:43,002
Don't come in. We'll be awfully late.

610
00:45:43,086 --> 00:45:44,996
-Don't be bashful.
-l'm not bashful.

611
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:49,040
l've never kissed you before.
And l don't think this is exactly the place.

612
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:53,217
lf you knew how crazy l am about you,
you wouldn't hesitate. l can't sleep nights.

613
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:55,847
-Try drinking some hot milk.
-l must be in love...

614
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:58,808
-because l started writing poetry to you.
-Poetry.

615
00:45:58,899 --> 00:46:03,194
l was going to surprise you with it at dinner,
but it's short. lt goes like this:

616
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,575
''To you, my little prairie flower
l'm thinking of you every hour

617
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:12,785
''Though now you're just a friend to me
l wonder what the end will be''

618
00:46:14,002 --> 00:46:17,254
Excuse me, Dan,
l do laugh at the oddest times.

619
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,634
You see what l mean?

620
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:29,814
''Oh, you would make my life divine

621
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:32,817
''if you would change your name to mine''

622
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:35,567
That's really....

623
00:46:35,657 --> 00:46:39,276
That's beautiful, Dan.
lt's really beautiful. There's my phone.

624
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,992
You've got to go now, really.

625
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:44,581
<i>-Hello.
-Comment a va, madame?</i>

626
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:49,085
-You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?
-Look, l have company.

627
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,679
All right, wait a minute, hold the phone.

628
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:59,644
There, now go on, Dan, l'll see you later.

629
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:07,774
Lucy, you've made me
the happiest man in the world.

630
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:12,577
Dreamed of this moment for days,
now it's all come true.

631
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,750
Dan, really!

632
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:20,546
l'll go home now and dress for dinner.
l'm so happy l could eat three steaks.

633
00:47:25,182 --> 00:47:26,427
Hello?

634
00:47:35,988 --> 00:47:37,020
Telephone.

635
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:41,692
Hello?

636
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:43,573
Can l expect you tomorrow?

637
00:47:43,665 --> 00:47:47,878
At 3:00 tomorrow afternoon?
l think that would be convenient.

638
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:51,668
Very well then, 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Goodbye.

639
00:47:53,094 --> 00:47:55,847
-Who was that?
-Why should it interest you?

640
00:47:56,933 --> 00:47:59,888
Wait a minute, after all,
the final decree isn't in yet.

641
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:02,767
-lf you must know, it was my masseuse.
-My who?

642
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,103
l've heard everything. l'm going out
to get some popcorn and pink lemonade.

643
00:48:08,198 --> 00:48:10,820
l've just seen a three-ring circus.

644
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:28,515
Armand Duvalle in?

645
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:31,389
-Please, your name?
-Jerry Warriner. ls my wife here?

646
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:32,850
l do not know.

647
00:48:33,482 --> 00:48:35,392
What do you mean you don't know?

648
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:38,985
-l only know l don't know.
-You wouldn't mind if l look around.

649
00:48:39,073 --> 00:48:40,354
Me, jujitsu.

650
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,660
-Me, jujitsu.
-ls that so?

651
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,509
Me, jujitsu, too.

652
00:48:56,263 --> 00:48:59,134
You must not go in.
You must not disturb him.

653
00:48:59,225 --> 00:49:01,895
l can't go in, he must not be disturbed.

654
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,821
You should have seen your master
this afternoon.

655
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,115
Come on, sit up, boy.

656
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:18,908
No, better still, l tell you...

657
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,705
go hide your eyes
and l'll give it to you that way.

658
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,885
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.
No peeking.

659
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:32,298
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty,
twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. You ready?

660
00:50:32,392 --> 00:50:34,967
All right, then, come on.

661
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:37,606
You're too smart.

662
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:41,898
Honestly, Patsy,
you should have seen Jerry this afternoon.

663
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:45,359
And when that chair
started to slip from under him.

664
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:49,617
-l will say that for Jerry, he's never dull.
-He was so silly, though.

665
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:52,543
l know he thought he'd find me
in Armand's arms.

666
00:50:52,628 --> 00:50:54,787
He must have been terribly disappointed.

667
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:58,714
He must have felt awful
about not finding you two in a clinch.

668
00:50:58,803 --> 00:51:02,719
Jerry's always had the most fantastic way
of getting into scrapes.

669
00:51:02,808 --> 00:51:05,051
We've had some grand laughs together.

670
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,851
But a girl really wants
dependability and security.

671
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,316
Yes, l suppose she does.

672
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:12,319
Then she ought to buy an annuity.
Be more fun than Leeson.

673
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:14,861
Don't explain. l'm not marrying him.

674
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,201
That's what l wanted to tell you.
l'm not either.

675
00:51:18,705 --> 00:51:22,324
l can't marry him because l'm still in love
with that crazy lunatic.

676
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:25,171
And there's nothing l can do about it.

677
00:51:26,966 --> 00:51:30,170
Patsy, here and there, now and then...

678
00:51:30,262 --> 00:51:33,264
-l've done a few things for you, haven't l?
-Yes.

679
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:37,812
Here's a note that l've written to Dan
explaining exactly why l can't marry him.

680
00:51:37,897 --> 00:51:41,813
l could never phrase anything in person
as beautifully as l have in this note.

681
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:44,436
But now l've lost my nerve
about giving it to him.

682
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:47,617
-Could you sort of see that he gets it?
-l should say so.

683
00:51:47,702 --> 00:51:50,075
Well, l tried to forget Jerry.

684
00:51:51,207 --> 00:51:52,239
l know.

685
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,374
That's why you jumped at Leeson
as if he were the last man on earth.

686
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,256
l'll answer that.

687
00:52:04,183 --> 00:52:07,138
Every time l open the door
somebody walks in.

688
00:52:07,229 --> 00:52:09,056
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

689
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:15,521
-Hello, Armand.
-You sent for me, madam.

690
00:52:15,615 --> 00:52:18,403
Yes, l've been so embarrassed
about what happened...

691
00:52:18,494 --> 00:52:21,615
in front of your guests
l couldn't get out of there soon enough.

692
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:24,459
Your husband is a very funny man, isn't he?

693
00:52:24,544 --> 00:52:28,377
l'm convinced he must care about me
or he wouldn't do those funny things.

694
00:52:28,465 --> 00:52:31,004
Yes, but he doesn't care much about me.

695
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:34,464
No, Armand, that's just what l'm getting at.

696
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:39,393
-l'm wondering, could you do me a favour?
-But of course.

697
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:41,065
l've been thinking...

698
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:45,067
l wonder if you could convince him...

699
00:52:45,155 --> 00:52:48,607
that everything was just as l said it was
that night at the inn.

700
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:50,279
l'd be glad to.

701
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,206
But does he carry a gun?

702
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:54,744
You're not afraid of him?

703
00:52:55,585 --> 00:52:59,086
-Of course not, but--
-Will you do it for me? As soon as possible?

704
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:00,205
Yes.

705
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,836
And, by all means, he mustn't know
that l had anything to do with it.

706
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,804
-No.
-As soon as possible.

707
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:12,812
Mr. Smith! How are you?

708
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:16,526
-But this is much too soon.
-lsn't it?

709
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:18,903
-Much too soon.
-What can l do?

710
00:53:18,992 --> 00:53:21,698
-You can't keep standing here.
-l know, but where can l go?

711
00:53:21,787 --> 00:53:23,247
-Look, out here.
-No.

712
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:24,790
Look, in the bedroom. Hurry up.

713
00:53:29,965 --> 00:53:32,291
-Hiya, fellow.
-Hello, Jerry.

714
00:53:32,385 --> 00:53:35,091
-Hello, Patsy. How have you been?
-Fine.

715
00:53:35,222 --> 00:53:37,975
You knew it was me, didn't you?
Sure you did.

716
00:53:43,316 --> 00:53:46,069
You remembered me, didn't you?
Sure, you bet.

717
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:50,651
Get away.

718
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,206
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Lucy.

719
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:58,662
-l suppose you know why l dropped in.
-No, l don't exactly.

720
00:53:58,754 --> 00:54:03,252
As a matter of fact, l came to apologise for
my behaviour today in Duvalle's apartment...

721
00:54:03,343 --> 00:54:06,215
-studio, or whatever he calls his joint.
-Oh, that?

722
00:54:06,306 --> 00:54:09,011
l certainly acted like a prize lunatic,
and l'm sorry.

723
00:54:09,101 --> 00:54:11,427
-lt was nothing at all.
-Nothing?

724
00:54:11,938 --> 00:54:15,225
Nothing except the most ridiculous
and sickening exhibition...

725
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,145
mortal man ever made of himself.

726
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:19,278
l don't know why l act like that.

727
00:54:19,365 --> 00:54:22,237
Unless it's because of the effect
that Duvalle has on me.

728
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:25,199
l never knew anyone
that can aggravate me the way he does.

729
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:29,039
-l can't think about him without seeing red.
-You shouldn't get so excited.

730
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,587
A mere mention of his name
and l feel positively murderous.

731
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:33,955
You do?

732
00:54:36,346 --> 00:54:38,505
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

733
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:42,100
l was just thinking about your problem.
You certainly have a problem.

734
00:54:42,187 --> 00:54:45,059
l know l have a problem,
and l know how l feel, too.

735
00:54:45,317 --> 00:54:47,809
l guess there's nothing l can do about it.

736
00:54:52,326 --> 00:54:54,070
Look at Mr. Smith.

737
00:54:54,955 --> 00:54:57,281
-l guess he wants to play.
-Yes.

738
00:54:59,169 --> 00:55:01,661
Here, you go and hide it for him.

739
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,339
No fair peeking, Smitty.

740
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,903
All right, let's go. Come on.

741
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:24,198
Oh, no, you're cold.

742
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:26,113
You're colder than ice. Cold, cold.

743
00:55:26,205 --> 00:55:28,578
Oh, boy, what's wrong with you?

744
00:55:32,922 --> 00:55:35,675
Nice going, fellow. Let it go. Good boy.

745
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:39,222
Well, Lucy...

746
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:45,604
the main idea is, do you accept my apology?

747
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:52,405
Besides making a blue-ribbon sap of myself
today, l must have embarrassed you terribly.

748
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:53,866
You took it fine, though.

749
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:56,621
-You must admit you were--
-Yes.

750
00:55:56,997 --> 00:56:01,126
-What was that?
-Nothing, just an old mirror.

751
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:06,165
-The boy's getting worse every day.
-Mr. Smith, that's a fine thing.

752
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:08,585
l'm surprised at you.
Trying to get rid of me?

753
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:11,432
No, he wasn't trying to get rid of you,
you know it.

754
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:15,388
Well, l really hadn't planned
to leave so soon.

755
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,526
l thought, if you have nothing to do,
you might like to go for a drive with me.

756
00:56:19,652 --> 00:56:23,236
Well, the air will do you good,
and we can talk things over?

757
00:56:23,324 --> 00:56:26,445
-l'd love that. Yes, it would do me good.
-Swell.

758
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:28,993
-Where's your car?
-Downstairs, in the garage.

759
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:33,662
While l'm changing,
you get the car and l'll meet you out front.

760
00:56:33,754 --> 00:56:36,246
-Okay, dear.
-l won't be a minute.

761
00:56:56,076 --> 00:56:59,363
That's funny, l only bought the hat
an hour ago and look at it.

762
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:01,241
Did you have a haircut, maybe?

763
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,120
-No.
-No?

764
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,505
Maybe you have it on backwards.
Put it on the other way around.

765
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:10,297
Well, l hadn't thought of that. Wait a minute.

766
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:16,723
Yes, there, now that's more becoming.

767
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:26,364
lt is a bit roomy. Maybe they're wearing
them that way this year.

768
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,530
Well, l'm not.

769
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:30,240
Looks mighty funny to me.

770
00:57:30,331 --> 00:57:33,249
Look at your ears. That's why.
Your ears are all down.

771
00:57:33,335 --> 00:57:34,960
What's wrong with it?

772
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:37,502
-Stick your ears up underneath.
-Don't be silly.

773
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:40,094
How can you stick your ears up?
That's no good.

774
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:41,339
Well, l always put my ears in.

775
00:57:49,106 --> 00:57:51,942
-Who's there?
-Me, and my ma.

776
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:56,858
Lucy, l've caused you enough trouble
for one day.

777
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,987
He better not find me here.
l'll duck in the other room.

778
00:58:00,121 --> 00:58:01,152
No, no, but....

779
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,246
Could you....

780
00:58:11,511 --> 00:58:13,339
-Hello, there.
-Hello, Aunt Patsy.

781
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,139
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.

782
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,684
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.

783
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:20,221
Lucy, you didn't come over this morning
the way you usually do.

784
00:58:20,315 --> 00:58:24,065
-l was so busy this morning.
-That's what l kept telling you, Ma.

785
00:58:24,153 --> 00:58:27,155
-Do you mind if l sit down?
-No, not at all.

786
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:36,750
-l've got an awful headache.
-Well, l'm getting one.

787
00:58:37,129 --> 00:58:41,211
l thought maybe you were angry
at my repeating what that awful....

788
00:58:41,844 --> 00:58:43,921
Nonsense, Mrs. Leeson.

789
00:58:44,305 --> 00:58:47,972
-What on earth was that?
-Somebody's cleaning up in there.

790
00:58:50,939 --> 00:58:52,315
l was afraid....

791
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:55,144
-Must they do that?
-Yes--

792
00:58:57,365 --> 00:59:01,198
l was afraid, but l knew that in your heart
you knew...

793
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,244
that l never suspected you.

794
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,367
Of course not, Mrs. Leeson.

795
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:11,131
The first time Dan talked about you, l said,
''Why, she sounds like a sweet little thing.''

796
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:13,969
Why, to know Lucy is to love her.

797
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:17,550
Lucy, l got a surprise for you.
Ma and l talked it all over.

798
00:59:17,642 --> 00:59:21,143
l hope you are going to like Oklahoma,
because l'm going to ask you....

799
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:24,025
Excuse me.

800
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,023
They forgot to touch second.

801
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:37,662
Come on, Dan.

802
00:59:38,629 --> 00:59:41,880
Well, l guess a man's best friend
is his mother.

803
00:59:46,306 --> 00:59:48,976
l certainly learned about women from you.

804
00:59:49,685 --> 00:59:52,224
-Here's your diploma.
-Come on.

805
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,942
What's the matter with you, Smitty?

806
01:00:05,623 --> 01:00:08,376
l see what you mean. Patsy, look at this.

807
01:00:10,255 --> 01:00:12,497
Oh, yes, that's Barbara Vance.

808
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:15,961
-You know who she is, don't you?
-Yes, l know who she is.

809
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:19,175
The madcap heiress. lsn't that
what the papers usually call her?

810
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:23,729
Millions of dollars and no sense.
l wonder what she's doing with Jerry.

811
01:00:23,815 --> 01:00:26,603
Entertaining him,
running around town with him...

812
01:00:26,693 --> 01:00:29,399
and l imagine falling in love with him.
That's all.

813
01:00:29,489 --> 01:00:32,195
-You can't tell all that from this picture.
-No.

814
01:00:32,284 --> 01:00:37,411
But l can tell it from what l've heard.
lf rumour is true, Barbara is quite a girl.

815
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,911
And Jerry's having a lot of fun.

816
01:01:50,056 --> 01:01:51,219
Come in.

817
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,091
Hello, Jerry.

818
01:01:55,438 --> 01:01:58,012
Hello, Lucy, what's the nature of this visit?

819
01:01:58,275 --> 01:02:00,482
Well, l just thought l'd....

820
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:02,610
-Do you know what today is?
-Certainly.

821
01:02:02,698 --> 01:02:06,531
Our divorce becomes final today.
Tomorrow, we'll both be back in circulation.

822
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:09,456
l just thought l'd drop up
and wish you a lot of luck.

823
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,041
That's very nice of you.
Would you like to join me for some wine?

824
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,873
Of course l would.

825
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:20,805
That was a cute picture of you and Barbara
in the morning paper.

826
01:02:22,683 --> 01:02:25,970
l love the caption: ''Off with the old love.''

827
01:02:26,063 --> 01:02:28,934
l thought ''Out of the frying pan''
might have been better.

828
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:30,057
ls that so?

829
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:34,444
Well, l think that Barbara and l
will be very happy together.

830
01:02:34,532 --> 01:02:36,490
l'm sure you'll be very happy.

831
01:02:36,744 --> 01:02:40,328
Only l don't think
you'll be as happy as Daniel and l.

832
01:02:41,709 --> 01:02:42,872
What?

833
01:02:44,337 --> 01:02:47,838
-ls that still on?
-What do you mean, ''ls that still on?''

834
01:02:48,802 --> 01:02:50,961
After that two-men-in-a-bedroom farce...

835
01:02:51,055 --> 01:02:54,140
l sort of imagined that when we left, he left.

836
01:02:54,226 --> 01:02:57,643
Oh, no. l just explained things to him
very simply.

837
01:02:57,939 --> 01:02:59,019
Oh, did you?

838
01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:01,065
Did you say our cars broke down...

839
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:04,189
and we had to stay at your place
because of the taxi strike?

840
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,855
No, l didn't tell him that. l told him the truth.

841
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:09,324
And, strangely enough, he believed me.

842
01:03:09,413 --> 01:03:10,991
Yes, it was very refreshing.

843
01:03:11,082 --> 01:03:13,205
Well, what shall we drink to?

844
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:15,577
Let's drink to our future.

845
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,758
Here's hoping you and Barbara
will be very happy...

846
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:22,885
which l doubt very much.

847
01:03:23,306 --> 01:03:25,845
Let's drink to your happiness
with Buffalo Bill...

848
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,641
-Good.
-...which doesn't even make sense.

849
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:32,729
-l'll tell you. We'll drink to the two of us.
-Good.

850
01:03:33,195 --> 01:03:35,568
As we go down life's highway...

851
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:37,947
you going your way...

852
01:03:38,452 --> 01:03:40,244
and l going my way.

853
01:03:41,873 --> 01:03:43,582
-Okay?
-All right.

854
01:03:47,381 --> 01:03:48,840
lt's flat.

855
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,549
l'll open another bottle.

856
01:03:55,058 --> 01:03:59,009
You'll have to hurry it up though
because l'm meeting Daniel.

857
01:04:02,317 --> 01:04:06,067
l think champagne is so fitting
to round out our romance.

858
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:09,654
l remember the first drink
we ever had together.

859
01:04:09,744 --> 01:04:12,236
You, in your very best manner, said:

860
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:14,371
''lt must be champagne.''

861
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:16,957
And then you offered a toast,
you remember?

862
01:04:17,046 --> 01:04:20,297
-No, l don't.
-Well, being a woman, l do.

863
01:04:20,759 --> 01:04:22,218
You said....

864
01:04:23,763 --> 01:04:25,388
This'll land you a laugh.

865
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:27,726
You said:

866
01:04:29,104 --> 01:04:31,726
''Lend an ear, l implore you

867
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:37,278
''This comes from my heart
l'll always adore you

868
01:04:38,283 --> 01:04:40,323
''Till death do us part''

869
01:04:44,624 --> 01:04:45,953
Remember?

870
01:04:52,301 --> 01:04:54,176
lt was pretty swell.

871
01:04:55,097 --> 01:04:57,137
l mean, while it lasted.

872
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:02,345
All beautiful things must end...

873
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,272
so l guess we may as well call it a day.

874
01:05:10,493 --> 01:05:13,031
lf you don't mind, l'll call a car.

875
01:05:19,588 --> 01:05:23,422
Would you call a car for me?
Right away, please.

876
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:28,964
Hello?

877
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:31,637
Who's this, may l ask?

878
01:05:32,397 --> 01:05:37,275
lt's what's-her-name. l only said hello.
Maybe you can pick it up from there.

879
01:05:37,905 --> 01:05:41,773
-Did you have to answer my phone?
-l thought it was about the car. l'm sorry.

880
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:43,778
What am l going to tell her?

881
01:05:44,246 --> 01:05:47,367
You can think of something.
You always could.

882
01:05:48,085 --> 01:05:52,167
-l haven't time to think of anything.
-Tell her you'll call her back.

883
01:05:52,758 --> 01:05:56,804
-How can l tell her l'll call her back?
-Then tell her to call you back.

884
01:05:58,224 --> 01:06:00,134
Hello? Hello, darling.

885
01:06:00,936 --> 01:06:04,637
Well, it took you long enough.
Have you decided who the woman is?

886
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:07,687
lsn't that funny,
l knew you were going to ask me that.

887
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:09,855
-So did l.
-Quiet.

888
01:06:11,658 --> 01:06:13,652
lt's very simple, dear. lt's my sister.

889
01:06:13,745 --> 01:06:16,782
Your sister?
How are you going to get out of that?

890
01:06:16,999 --> 01:06:19,787
She just got back from Paris,
dropped in to see me.

891
01:06:19,878 --> 01:06:21,538
Jerry, you're slipping.

892
01:06:22,131 --> 01:06:27,127
l'd love to meet your sister.
Why don't you bring her along tonight?

893
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:30,176
She can't come this evening.
She has a previous engagement.

894
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:32,225
She wants me to come over?

895
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:34,803
Naturally she's anxious
to meet you, too, but....

896
01:06:34,898 --> 01:06:38,731
Yes, tell her l'd love to meet her.
Tell her to wear boxing gloves.

897
01:06:39,404 --> 01:06:42,359
She said she'll break her engagement
and come over later.

898
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,858
-But l strongly doubt that....
-Yes, l doubt it.

899
01:06:44,953 --> 01:06:48,655
Dear, l'll do my best to fix it up
so the two of you meet very soon.

900
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,542
-Yes. Goodbye.
-That'd be lovely.

901
01:06:52,505 --> 01:06:55,044
l'm in a fine fix.
She wants to meet my sister.

902
01:06:55,134 --> 01:06:58,884
-You're a big help.
-You know me. Anything l can do....

903
01:06:59,139 --> 01:07:01,713
-What? To break it up?
-l see what you mean.

904
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,601
l'm in a fine mess.

905
01:07:05,398 --> 01:07:08,186
Yes, hello? l did it again.

906
01:07:08,694 --> 01:07:10,936
What does she do? Call every five minutes?

907
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,783
-You shouldn't take that from anybody.
-Hello, Barbara.

908
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:15,243
Put your foot down....

909
01:07:15,328 --> 01:07:19,327
-l told you she couldn't make it this evening.
-She can't get away with it.

910
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:22,703
There's no reason to call me
every five minutes about it, is there?

911
01:07:22,796 --> 01:07:24,623
No. Well, all right.

912
01:07:34,353 --> 01:07:37,059
-Good evening, Mr. Warriner.
-Good evening.

913
01:07:47,287 --> 01:07:48,948
-Hello, Barbara.
-Hello.

914
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,790
Good evening, Mrs. Vance.

915
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:52,703
-Hello, Mr. Vance.
-Jerry.

916
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:54,664
Where's your sister?

917
01:07:55,632 --> 01:07:58,468
She was terribly sorry
she couldn't be here tonight.

918
01:07:58,552 --> 01:08:02,634
She didn't weather the boat trip well.
When l left, she was calling the doctor.

919
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:05,762
You can imagine my surprise
when a woman answered the phone.

920
01:08:05,854 --> 01:08:08,144
You can't blame me for being suspicious.

921
01:08:08,232 --> 01:08:11,852
Barbara, you can't have a happy married life
if you're always suspicious.

922
01:08:12,363 --> 01:08:14,107
There can't be doubts in marriage.

923
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:17,651
Marriage is based on faith.
lf you lose that, you've lost everything.

924
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:19,655
Very well said, Jerry.

925
01:08:19,831 --> 01:08:23,415
Yes, wasn't it?
l think l read it in a book or something.

926
01:08:24,129 --> 01:08:27,665
l was just thinking,
will your sister be here for the wedding?

927
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:33,096
-l doubt that very much, Mrs. Vance.
-Maybe l should ask her to be a bridesmaid.

928
01:08:34,226 --> 01:08:37,144
l think she's sailing back to Paris
almost immediately.

929
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:39,603
She said she'll try
to see you before she goes.

930
01:08:39,691 --> 01:08:41,649
You'd like my sister. She's your type.

931
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:43,776
-Where did she go to school?
-Excuse me?

932
01:08:43,864 --> 01:08:47,068
-l said, where did she go to school?
-ln Switzerland.

933
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:52,617
-You say your father was a Princeton man?
-That's right, sir. Class of '92.

934
01:08:53,168 --> 01:08:56,039
He tells some funny stories
about the place in those days.

935
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:58,622
He tells one in particular
about a football game.

936
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,209
lt seems Yale was playing
Princeton one day...

937
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:05,255
and with the ball
on Princeton's two yard line, Yale fumbled.

938
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:08,686
A minute to go, Dad picked up the ball,
and ran....

939
01:09:09,732 --> 01:09:11,772
Miss Lola Warriner.

940
01:09:26,212 --> 01:09:28,835
Hello, brother dear. l made it.

941
01:09:31,261 --> 01:09:33,254
What did you say, dear?

942
01:09:34,307 --> 01:09:38,436
-l just asked how you were feeling.
-l'm feeling fine. And you?

943
01:09:40,982 --> 01:09:43,308
Mrs. Vance, may l present my sister, Lola.

944
01:09:43,402 --> 01:09:44,731
How do you do?

945
01:09:44,821 --> 01:09:47,443
-lt's lovely to know you.
-Thank you.

946
01:09:47,992 --> 01:09:50,318
-Won't you come in?
-Thank you.

947
01:09:56,795 --> 01:09:59,631
-Barbara, this is Lola.
-How do you do?

948
01:09:59,716 --> 01:10:01,590
lt's nice to be able to meet you.

949
01:10:01,677 --> 01:10:04,251
l've seen your pictures,
and wondered how you look.

950
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:06,886
-l wondered about you, too.
-Well, thank you.

951
01:10:06,976 --> 01:10:08,684
-Lola?
-Yes, dear?

952
01:10:09,312 --> 01:10:11,555
This is Barbara's father, Mr. Vance.

953
01:10:11,649 --> 01:10:14,022
-Mr. Vance, my sister.
-How do you do?

954
01:10:15,153 --> 01:10:16,862
What's the matter?

955
01:10:16,947 --> 01:10:20,697
Nothing, only l never would have known you
from his description.

956
01:10:20,786 --> 01:10:23,622
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.

957
01:10:32,009 --> 01:10:36,174
Did l interrupt something?
Weren't you talking when l came in for....

958
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:39,055
Would you excuse me, Mrs. Vance?
My handkerchief.

959
01:10:39,144 --> 01:10:40,389
Thank you.

960
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:45,185
lt's me. lsn't that silly?

961
01:10:48,865 --> 01:10:50,609
lt's you this time, Mrs. Vance.

962
01:10:50,701 --> 01:10:54,154
Look, l'll just put it over here,
and get it out of the way.

963
01:10:56,376 --> 01:10:57,407
Dear!

964
01:10:57,502 --> 01:11:00,208
l guess that could go on and on and on.

965
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,626
l hope not.

966
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,381
Go on with your story, honey.

967
01:11:06,472 --> 01:11:09,640
Yes, l was telling a story about my,
about our father.

968
01:11:09,727 --> 01:11:11,008
Oh, you were?

969
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:14,355
l don't want to be rude,
but may l have a drink?

970
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:19,778
l had three or four before l came, but
they're wearing off, you know how that is.

971
01:11:21,701 --> 01:11:25,997
Don't look at me like that.
You like a little drink yourself.

972
01:11:27,626 --> 01:11:29,916
We call him Jerry the Nipper.

973
01:11:30,505 --> 01:11:34,670
Likes to sneak it when nobody's looking.
So cute about it, too.

974
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,471
l've seen him go an evening,
apparently having nothing to drink...

975
01:11:38,557 --> 01:11:41,393
and all of a sudden, fall flat on his puss.

976
01:11:45,358 --> 01:11:47,352
A glass of sherry, perhaps?

977
01:11:47,444 --> 01:11:50,530
Will you get Miss Warriner
a glass of sherry?

978
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:54,328
A glass of sherry? Excuse me.

979
01:11:54,579 --> 01:11:56,204
l don't like sherry.

980
01:11:59,127 --> 01:12:02,164
-Would you make that ginger ale please?
-Ginger ale?

981
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,384
l'm sorry to interrupt you again, Jerry.
Now, what were you saying?

982
01:12:11,477 --> 01:12:15,392
l was just telling one of Father's stories.
You've heard it.

983
01:12:15,524 --> 01:12:17,601
With a minute to go, Dad had the ball--

984
01:12:17,693 --> 01:12:20,268
-A ball? What ball?
-The football.

985
01:12:20,364 --> 01:12:23,816
What in the world was Dad ever doing
with a football?

986
01:12:24,703 --> 01:12:29,248
l was just telling a story about when Father
was at Princeton. You remember--

987
01:12:29,334 --> 01:12:32,206
Oh, yes, of course l remember.
Pop loved Princeton.

988
01:12:32,296 --> 01:12:34,337
He was there nearly 20 years.

989
01:12:34,925 --> 01:12:38,212
lf ever a man loved a place, he did.
He just adored it.

990
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:41,425
And he certainly kept it looking beautiful.

991
01:12:42,268 --> 01:12:44,226
You've seen the grounds, of course.

992
01:12:44,313 --> 01:12:45,558
Of course?

993
01:12:47,025 --> 01:12:48,567
-Thank you.
-l'm afraid l'm--

994
01:12:49,278 --> 01:12:50,559
So sorry!

995
01:12:50,655 --> 01:12:52,648
-Here's your handkerchief.
-Thank you.

996
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:56,443
l'm afraid that my sister
has a somewhat distorted sense of humour.

997
01:12:56,537 --> 01:12:57,487
So have l.

998
01:12:57,581 --> 01:13:00,251
What she meant was,
Father presented the college...

999
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,660
with some of its finest landscapings.

1000
01:13:04,048 --> 01:13:08,545
Excuse me. Was l thirsty!
lt must have been that ham l had for dinner.

1001
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:15,727
-l think my brother's pretty swell, don't you?
-Oh, yes.

1002
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,140
He's always been pretty swell to me.

1003
01:13:18,233 --> 01:13:20,808
l was working my head off
at the Virginia Club.

1004
01:13:20,904 --> 01:13:24,819
But the minute he started doing better,
you know what l mean...

1005
01:13:24,909 --> 01:13:29,656
why, he made me give up my job
and take a trip to London and Paris...

1006
01:13:29,749 --> 01:13:32,585
and.... l think that was pretty swell,
don't you?

1007
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:34,579
What did you do at the Virginia Club?

1008
01:13:34,672 --> 01:13:36,666
-You see--
-l'll tell her!

1009
01:13:37,176 --> 01:13:40,343
lt was a little act, kind of....

1010
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:42,757
Well, it's a little hard to explain.

1011
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:45,424
-Have you got any records?
-Records?

1012
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:49,104
-Yes. We have some records.
-Well, maybe if we....

1013
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:51,651
Say, wait a minute!

1014
01:13:55,534 --> 01:13:58,073
Don't anybody leave this room.
l've lost my purse.

1015
01:13:58,162 --> 01:14:02,244
-Why, here it is.
-Well, am l relieved.

1016
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:04,752
Where are the records?

1017
01:14:04,838 --> 01:14:07,246
Come this way and l'll show you.

1018
01:14:08,301 --> 01:14:11,172
Look, will you keep an eye on that for me?

1019
01:14:15,728 --> 01:14:18,932
Here's my song.
Would you like to have me do it for you?

1020
01:14:19,024 --> 01:14:21,064
-Well, no, l don't--
-Okay.

1021
01:14:21,944 --> 01:14:26,109
You'll have to put that on.
lt's a little fancy for me.

1022
01:14:26,242 --> 01:14:28,994
The one we've got at home, you just wind.

1023
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:30,574
l wouldn't, if l were you.

1024
01:14:30,664 --> 01:14:33,037
l won't do it the way l did at the club...

1025
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:35,534
if that's what you're afraid of.

1026
01:14:35,629 --> 01:14:37,421
You think l'm a fool?

1027
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:40,336
The number has some wind effects...

1028
01:14:40,428 --> 01:14:44,343
but you'll just have to use
your own imagination about them.

1029
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:57,689
Get it?

1030
01:15:30,286 --> 01:15:31,615
l never could do that.

1031
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:40,541
Are we going so soon?

1032
01:15:40,634 --> 01:15:42,710
l was just beginning to enjoy myself.

1033
01:15:42,803 --> 01:15:45,176
Good night. Good night, all.

1034
01:15:50,772 --> 01:15:53,608
-Where are you going?
-l'm going to Patsy's cabin.

1035
01:15:53,693 --> 01:15:58,155
-You're not in any condition to drive.
-l can make it in two minutes on two wheels.

1036
01:15:58,241 --> 01:15:59,522
That's what you think.

1037
01:15:59,618 --> 01:16:02,573
-Get over.
-This is my car. l want to drive my car.

1038
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:03,743
-Over.
-No.

1039
01:16:03,832 --> 01:16:06,502
-l wish you'd stayed in there.
-That's right.

1040
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:10,956
Would you mind shutting that off,
or at least turning it down?

1041
01:16:14,054 --> 01:16:15,299
Give it to me.

1042
01:16:16,974 --> 01:16:19,810
That's right, put it where we can find it.

1043
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:24,518
-Here, you can't do that.
-What?

1044
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,519
-Shut that thing off.
-What?

1045
01:16:27,822 --> 01:16:30,658
lt's against the law.
Besides, you'll wake everyone up.

1046
01:16:30,743 --> 01:16:31,858
What?

1047
01:16:31,953 --> 01:16:35,240
He says we'll wake up....

1048
01:16:36,542 --> 01:16:38,452
Why don't you help me?

1049
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:06,156
-lt's beautiful up here, don't you think so?
-Sure, it's swell.

1050
01:17:06,249 --> 01:17:08,575
lf it wasn't for you, l'd have missed all this.

1051
01:17:08,669 --> 01:17:09,618
That's right.

1052
01:17:09,712 --> 01:17:11,705
l suppose by the time l get to town...

1053
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:14,290
it will hardly be worthwhile going to bed.

1054
01:17:14,385 --> 01:17:16,425
You mind if l use your car to go home?

1055
01:17:16,513 --> 01:17:19,052
No, l don't mind,
only l think it's awfully silly.

1056
01:17:19,141 --> 01:17:20,885
Patsy will be disappointed.

1057
01:17:20,977 --> 01:17:23,018
Well, thanks. l'll go home.

1058
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:26,143
lt's all right with me.
My goodness, l just thought....

1059
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:28,726
Yes, you just thought
that if l'd stay up there...

1060
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:33,152
you'd show me exactly how innocent
a night in the country can be, didn't you?

1061
01:17:34,746 --> 01:17:37,748
Are you still harping
on that same old string?

1062
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,621
lt doesn't matter to me
whether you go or stay.

1063
01:17:40,712 --> 01:17:43,917
l was just trying
to make it easier for you, that's all.

1064
01:17:53,646 --> 01:17:55,640
Did you have to throw that gadget away?

1065
01:17:55,732 --> 01:17:58,189
You want me to go back and look for it?

1066
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:00,688
What else can happen to us?

1067
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:02,613
A lot.

1068
01:18:05,579 --> 01:18:07,572
-What's that?
-Two motorcycles.

1069
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:10,491
-Anybody riding them?
-There are two men.

1070
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:12,793
-Are they in uniform?
-Yes.

1071
01:18:15,134 --> 01:18:16,297
Fine.

1072
01:18:29,403 --> 01:18:31,361
-Turn down that radio.
-l can't.

1073
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:33,606
What do you mean you can't?

1074
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,406
You lost the control?
You can't let it run that way!

1075
01:18:36,496 --> 01:18:40,198
-Let me take a look at it.
-Wait a minute, l'll get out of your way.

1076
01:18:40,293 --> 01:18:41,835
See what you can do.

1077
01:18:42,879 --> 01:18:46,000
-Help me to sort the wiring.
-Let's take a look at it.

1078
01:18:51,975 --> 01:18:53,256
Don't!

1079
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:58,017
lt's always good.

1080
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:01,350
Do you know you can get a ticket for that?

1081
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:02,947
-ls this your car?
-Nope!

1082
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:05,570
-Whose car is it?
-l'll give you one more guess.

1083
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:07,867
So it's yours. Where's your ownership card?

1084
01:19:07,955 --> 01:19:11,491
-ln my bureau's upper right-hand drawer.
-Are you sure this is your car?

1085
01:19:11,585 --> 01:19:13,163
Of course l'm sure!

1086
01:19:13,254 --> 01:19:16,838
lf it's your car, what's the license number?
What is it?

1087
01:19:16,925 --> 01:19:19,382
l don't know. They change it every year.

1088
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:22,840
Don't look now,
but what's the number on your motorcycle?

1089
01:19:24,477 --> 01:19:28,013
-Have you folks been drinking?
-No, l haven't, but....

1090
01:19:28,524 --> 01:19:31,277
-Let me see you walk this line.
-Come on.

1091
01:19:33,155 --> 01:19:35,113
Go on, honey, truck it!

1092
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:55,433
-Now what have you done?
-The brakes are bad.

1093
01:19:55,561 --> 01:19:59,310
lt's a bad break for us, too.
Now we haven't any transportation.

1094
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:03,445
Could you two gentlemen take us
to my aunt's cabin? lt's only 15 miles.

1095
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:06,900
-That is, if you've nothing else to do.
-No, l don't.

1096
01:20:06,993 --> 01:20:08,238
-Have you?
-Oh, no.

1097
01:20:08,328 --> 01:20:09,871
Oh, that's fine.

1098
01:20:11,374 --> 01:20:12,654
Where will you sit?

1099
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:15,539
l'll have to figure that one out, l guess.

1100
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,935
Come on, try it. lt's fun!

1101
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:24,679
Now, listen, you two.
Don't say a word to this guy.

1102
01:21:25,807 --> 01:21:27,468
Who are these people?

1103
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,134
Why, that's Mrs. Warriner
and that's Mr. Warriner.

1104
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:32,022
How do you do?

1105
01:21:33,568 --> 01:21:34,647
Hello.

1106
01:21:34,736 --> 01:21:38,782
l guess that settles it.
Will you get my car out in the morning?

1107
01:21:38,867 --> 01:21:43,080
ln the meantime, think of something
you'd like for Christmas. Goodbye.

1108
01:21:43,706 --> 01:21:46,708
-l hope you have a nice trip back.
-Thank you.

1109
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:47,825
Hi, Dad.

1110
01:21:48,546 --> 01:21:49,626
Hello, Dad.

1111
01:21:49,714 --> 01:21:51,340
Everything all right with you?

1112
01:21:51,425 --> 01:21:53,999
-Oh, l'm feeling fine.
-That's good.

1113
01:21:55,097 --> 01:21:57,470
But l wasn't expecting nobody tonight.

1114
01:21:57,558 --> 01:21:59,053
lsn't Aunt Patsy here?

1115
01:21:59,144 --> 01:22:01,303
-Well, no.
-She isn't here?

1116
01:22:01,981 --> 01:22:04,473
-But l thought for sure she was here.
-l didn't.

1117
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:06,276
lsn't that funny?

1118
01:22:06,362 --> 01:22:08,106
Let me get you some coffee.

1119
01:22:08,198 --> 01:22:10,571
Oh, no, l don't think so, Dad.

1120
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:14,409
lt might keep me awake.
l'm going right to bed. l'm awfully tired.

1121
01:22:17,126 --> 01:22:18,586
See? She's all in.

1122
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:21,340
-Oh, Dad, is this room in order?
-Yes.

1123
01:22:21,424 --> 01:22:23,797
That's fine. Mr. Warriner will sleep in there.

1124
01:22:23,886 --> 01:22:27,470
Give him a couple of nice warm blankets.
He has a bad cold.

1125
01:22:27,557 --> 01:22:28,637
ls that right?

1126
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:31,514
l've had a bad cold now
for some considerable time.

1127
01:22:31,604 --> 01:22:34,096
-That's too bad.
-About three months.

1128
01:22:36,069 --> 01:22:37,563
How are you doing in there?

1129
01:22:37,654 --> 01:22:39,944
l'm having a little wardrobe trouble.

1130
01:22:40,032 --> 01:22:41,361
You should see me.

1131
01:22:41,451 --> 01:22:44,287
l'm glad you told him l have a cold.
He fixed me up good.

1132
01:22:44,372 --> 01:22:47,908
My nightie is coming to me
through the courtesy of Aunt Patsy.

1133
01:22:54,218 --> 01:22:55,879
Go, get off!

1134
01:23:24,926 --> 01:23:26,385
Air-conditioned.

1135
01:23:29,182 --> 01:23:31,721
-What's wrong with this?
-l don't know.

1136
01:23:35,774 --> 01:23:38,183
The lock isn't very practical, is it?

1137
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:41,856
No, it's not so very practical....

1138
01:23:42,492 --> 01:23:44,699
l guess it will serve its purpose.

1139
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:51,242
Well, good night.

1140
01:23:52,964 --> 01:23:54,245
Good night.

1141
01:24:18,331 --> 01:24:21,168
l'm afraid we're going to have trouble
with this.

1142
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:23,376
l guess l'll be all right.

1143
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:29,759
-Good night.
-Good night.

1144
01:24:32,183 --> 01:24:33,382
Good night.

1145
01:25:37,522 --> 01:25:39,562
l told you we'd have trouble with this.

1146
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:40,895
Yes.

1147
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:51,657
ln a half an hour,
we'll no longer be Mr. and Mrs.

1148
01:25:53,126 --> 01:25:54,502
Funny, isn't it?

1149
01:25:55,003 --> 01:25:59,252
Yes, it's funny that everything
is the way it is, on account of how you feel.

1150
01:26:00,261 --> 01:26:04,805
l mean, if you didn't feel how you do,
things wouldn't be as they are, would they?

1151
01:26:05,851 --> 01:26:09,518
l mean, things could be the same
if things were different.

1152
01:26:11,484 --> 01:26:14,237
-But things are the way you made them.
-Oh, no.

1153
01:26:14,321 --> 01:26:18,190
Things are the way you think l made them.
l didn't make them that way at all.

1154
01:26:18,285 --> 01:26:21,038
Things are just the same
as they always were...

1155
01:26:21,247 --> 01:26:23,786
only you're the same as you were, too...

1156
01:26:24,084 --> 01:26:27,336
so l guess things
will never be the same again.

1157
01:26:35,266 --> 01:26:36,677
Good night.

1158
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,947
-Got caught in the door.
-Good night.

1159
01:26:49,285 --> 01:26:50,448
Good night.

1160
01:28:21,868 --> 01:28:23,493
Why, you....

1161
01:28:30,755 --> 01:28:32,795
l was trying to stop it.

1162
01:28:33,968 --> 01:28:35,760
Well, there it goes again.

1163
01:28:52,993 --> 01:28:55,236
You're all confused, aren't you?

1164
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,618
-Aren't you?
-No.

1165
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:01,629
You should be. You're wrong
about things being different...

1166
01:29:01,713 --> 01:29:03,790
because they're not the same.

1167
01:29:03,883 --> 01:29:06,802
Things are different,
except in a different way.

1168
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:09,593
You're still the same, only l've been a fool.

1169
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:11,350
But l'm not now.

1170
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:14,429
As long as l'm different, don't you think...

1171
01:29:14,522 --> 01:29:16,646
maybe things could be the same again...

1172
01:29:16,734 --> 01:29:18,442
only a little different?

1173
01:29:18,903 --> 01:29:20,481
You mean that, Jerry?

1174
01:29:21,365 --> 01:29:22,741
Are you sure?

1175
01:29:23,076 --> 01:29:26,446
No more doubts? No more being....

1176
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:31,333
-Except....
-Except what?

1177
01:29:31,879 --> 01:29:34,881
-There's only one thing that bothers me.
-What?

1178
01:29:37,387 --> 01:29:38,965
This darn lock.

1179
01:29:41,893 --> 01:29:43,091
ls that all?

1180
01:29:49,611 --> 01:29:51,901
You think maybe if you....

1181
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,511
Good night.
