1
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,945
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You are my god.

2
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,982
My inspiration, my everything.

3
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:33,548
He's on a different level now,
how he listens...

4
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:35,987
...and plays records.
I think he's very special...

5
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,786
...because no other DJ can do that.

6
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:41,424
I don't know what he was doing,
whether he was...

7
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,587
...honing his talents
in another direction.

8
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:45,858
He just disappeared
from the scene completely.

9
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:47,331
It was really depressing.

10
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:51,738
He's probably down in South America,
still hanging out.

11
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:54,568
Probably trying to snort up
one of the countries, or...

12
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:57,210
I don't know, he's just...

13
00:00:57,378 --> 00:00:59,868
I like to think he's still out there.

14
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,243
Frankie, I'm curious. Can you tell me
about your flip-flop collection?

15
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:42,646
I'm a bit of the Imelda Marcos
of the flip-flop world.

16
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,718
Flip-flop, for me, is perfection.

17
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:49,084
And sometimes if I'm stuck
and I can't mix, I can't...

18
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:52,192
You know, I'm a creative person.
I'm an artist.

19
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,795
So sometimes I just stare
at a flip-flop for hours.

20
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,193
I'm not joking.
I'm being serious, yeah.

21
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,855
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

22
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:02,024
Recently, you've been married...

23
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:05,466
...so how is it now
being a husband?

24
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:07,765
- An "ass band"?
- Husband.

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,100
- Oh, husband.
- Husband.

26
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:11,641
A husband. Yeah, it's very nice.

27
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:13,176
It's what I've...

28
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:14,607
Say hello!

29
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:18,340
Hello, Ibiza!

30
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:25,285
<i>DJ! DJ! DJ! DJ!</i>

31
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:56,823
<i>This is Pete Tong, you're listening</i>
<i>to The Essential Selection. </i>

32
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:59,755
<i>I'm sitting across from Frankie Wilde. </i>
<i>How are you, Frankie?</i>

33
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:01,189
<i>I feel like a star, man. </i>

34
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:03,763
<i>Eleven years. </i>
<i>Eleven years in Ibiza... </i>

35
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,091
<i>... playing some of the best clubs</i>
<i>in the world. </i>

36
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,734
- <i>How do you feel about it this year?</i>
- <i>What, mate?</i>

37
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:12,837
<i>It's your 11th year, Frankie,</i>
<i>playing in Ibiza. You must be thrilled. </i>

38
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:20,668
It's been fucking hot, ain't it, here,
the last week?

39
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:22,676
God.

40
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:24,246
I mean...

41
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,574
...think about...
You're old, like me.

42
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:29,686
You're an old geezer.

43
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:32,413
You remember that martini
campaign in the '70s?

44
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,216
"Martini is"

45
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,621
Dot, dot, dot, dot.
Remember that?

46
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:40,128
When I was a kid,
that wow-ed me out, man, bigtime.

47
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,163
It's like, "is" what?
What the fuck is it?

48
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:46,165
What the fuck is martini?

49
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:50,395
But I was young,
and I didn't really understand.

50
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:54,099
And now I'm mature...

51
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:58,678
...and I've lived 38 years,
and I can confidently say:

52
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:01,140
"Ibiza is"

53
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:05,813
Dot, dot, dot, dot. You know
what I mean? And that's really nice.

54
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:08,613
It's really nice
to be able to feel that.

55
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:13,148
There's spunk everywhere
on this island.

56
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:16,727
Everyone's done it,
and they've been free with it.

57
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:18,760
They haven't done it
to make babies.

58
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:21,923
They've fucking swung out
and spun a bit out...

59
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,568
...and it's hit a plant,
and that's grown.

60
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:27,393
Wall, and there's vines
and ivy and shit.

61
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:31,201
It's all spunk. Look at this lot out here.
Look at them.

62
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,276
They all love it.
They fucking love it.

63
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:38,540
- Who out there likes to fucking party?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

64
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:41,912
I can't hear you! Who out there
likes to fucking party?

65
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:45,077
- Who likes to fucking party?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

66
00:06:58,132 --> 00:06:59,963
<i>Frankie was definitely</i>
<i>one of the best. </i>

67
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,863
<i>He had his very, sort of,</i>
<i>own style... </i>

68
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,266
<i>... his very own momentum</i>
<i>with the crowd. </i>

69
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:07,335
No one else did it his way.

70
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:13,669
He's a showman
as much as he is a musician.

71
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:16,440
<i>He controlled the crowd</i>
<i>musically and physically. </i>

72
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:21,286
<i>He was a born natural</i>
<i>behind the turntable. </i>

73
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:23,387
<i>There's no doubt. </i>
<i>I was jealous of that. </i>

74
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:26,384
I always had to try a bit harder.

75
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,556
Super, super, super, <i>loco</i>.

76
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,670
<i>Frankie was cruising along,</i>
<i>doing his thing... </i>

77
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:29,074
<i>... getting all the attention that</i>
<i>he needed. And then he met Max. </i>

78
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:33,707
No. Hey, tell him it's like a wasp
just stung my clit, yeah.

79
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:36,410
I don't give a fuck if he's religious.
Tell him anyway.

80
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,612
Fuck him. Bye. Anyway...

81
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,891
A bit of a tosser.
Not my sort of person...

82
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,084
...but absolutely took him
to the next level.

83
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,596
I love you, Max!

84
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:58,428
<i>Max first brought Frankie</i>
<i>to my attention. </i>

85
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:00,700
<i>I knew he had what it took</i>
<i>behind the decks... </i>

86
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:06,904
<i>... but it turned out that Frankie really</i>
<i>understood the music production side. </i>

87
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,276
<i>You know,</i>
<i>knew his way around a studio. </i>

88
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,719
Do you think
we're making a jazz album?

89
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,618
I'm just right in the middle
of going all the fucking way.

90
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,725
Should we swap them over
for some brushes?

91
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,360
You know:

92
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,222
Start fucking hitting those drums.

93
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:29,163
Start banging those drums like
you bang your fucking sister!

94
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,700
Clear, Siegfried?

95
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:36,599
That's the first one.

96
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,511
So I signed him straightaway.

97
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,246
And Frankie delivered.

98
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,748
<i>It was massive. </i>

99
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:56,550
<i>Come out of car windows, in the</i>
<i>supermarket. Even my grandmother... </i>

100
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:01,260
...would whistle that tune when I went
to see her in the nursing home.

101
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:31,749
<i>Frankie met Sonya when they were</i>
<i>on the video shoot to "Rise Again. "</i>

102
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,017
Oh, man. I mean, everybody knew
that she'd been about.

103
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,718
But he seemed to like that.
I mean, that was his thing.

104
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:41,353
You know, I mean,
even I'd had a go at her.

105
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,600
15-love.

106
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:57,177
I was thinking, you know how
Paul Newman's got...

107
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:59,041
...his salad dressings and that?

108
00:10:59,214 --> 00:11:02,809
So why not Frankie Wilde hummus?

109
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:05,509
- That's a good idea.
- People come and see the gigs...

110
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,212
...they say,
"Fuck, that was a great set, Frankie. "

111
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,584
I'll say, "Cheers, mate.
You want some hummus?"

112
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:13,090
- You know, just as a thing.
- Yeah.

113
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:15,591
Quite a good name for an album.

114
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:17,094
How's that?

115
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:19,390
Frankie Wilde, <i>Hummus. </i>

116
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,634
What, call my album <i>Hummus</i>?

117
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:23,792
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

118
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,564
I've got good ideas, Frankie.
You should listen to me.

119
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,606
If I've got my own hummus brand
and my album's called <i>Hummus... </i>

120
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:32,300
...it's getting a bit much.
- I think it's a good name.

121
00:11:32,478 --> 00:11:34,810
Why don't I change my name
to "Frankie Hummus"?

122
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,504
No, it sounds good. Yeah.

123
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:40,242
<i>I think a lot of people tolerated her</i>
<i>because she was Frankie's wife. </i>

124
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:43,945
<i>At the end of the day, I think</i>
<i>she was partying with everyone else. </i>

125
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,783
I didn't like her. I didn't think
she was good for him.

126
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:50,053
- I fucking hate you.
- I fucking hate you.

127
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,559
- <i>And did I fuck her?</i>
- <i>Yeah. </i>

128
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,856
Yeah, I fucked her.

129
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:06,134
Legend has it that Frank's problems
started undramatically.

130
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:09,602
It was the simplest thing
that kicked it off.

131
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,611
It was years and years of noise
was the basis of the problem.

132
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:17,046
<i>But the very beginnings of it,</i>
<i>in his life, started very plainly. </i>

133
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,237
<i>Frankie's problem was quite</i>
<i>a common problem amongst DJ's... </i>

134
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,669
<i>... an occupational hazard. </i>
<i>They work in the clubs. </i>

135
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,605
The noise just takes its toll.

136
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,143
<i>Someone like Frankie,</i>
<i>having a problem like that, I thought:</i>

137
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:33,012
<i>"This geezer's gonna go. </i>
<i>He's gonna lose it. "</i>

138
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:34,413
And he did lose it.

139
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:37,915
I watched him lose it,
slowly but surely.

140
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:49,277
Fucking come on, then!

141
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:38,286
I think we could have the Spanish
look, I like this color for the water.

142
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:40,898
Perhaps maybe that one, Japanese.

143
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,557
Frankie. Morning, honey.

144
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,225
Oh, Frankie!

145
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,881
Come here.
I want to ask you something.

146
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,447
- Morning.
- Morning, sweet...

147
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:06,785
You all right?

148
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,518
If we go for the Spanish look...

149
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:28,737
It's for the garden.

150
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:39,080
- A bit of both.
- Okay. Little bit of both.

151
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,549
- We can do that, can't we?
- Yeah.

152
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:45,155
Fuck! Fucking hell!

153
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,558
You all right?

154
00:17:00,337 --> 00:17:02,430
<i>His hearing was fucked. </i>

155
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,836
<i>But he tried to keep working</i>
<i>and plow through. </i>

156
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:08,033
You know,
put the horse blinkers on.

157
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,147
Ignore the problem, and it'll go away.
You know, always works for me.

158
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:51,210
<i>Can you tell us what's happening</i>
<i>with the new album?</i>

159
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:55,915
<i>Have I got a spot? Have I...?</i>

160
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,015
- No.
- It's fine.

161
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:59,918
You're perfect. You're perfect.

162
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:03,150
Your fans are curious about
the new album. They have to know.

163
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:06,295
It's good. It's going really well.
It's going really well.

164
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:11,490
Been bending the sound, sort of.
I've been forging it.

165
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,795
With a lyrical smelter.

166
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:19,635
Yeah.

167
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:24,402
- Not as beautiful as you.
- Thank you.

168
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,543
And I got these two...

169
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,615
...like, Austrian mates...

170
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:32,616
...who are stoking the fires.

171
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:36,688
Everybody should have
at least two Austrian mates.

172
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:39,654
Everybody should have
at least two.

173
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:41,884
When can we expect
the new album to come out?

174
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:43,392
- Soon.
- Soon?

175
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:44,654
Ish.

176
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,219
Can I have a word?

177
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,156
Can I have a word?

178
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:21,989
Yeah. It's good?

179
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:24,792
I took a call just before,
a couple of hours ago.

180
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:28,298
I forgot to mention it, but I need to...
I need to...

181
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:33,236
The album people,
they want the lyrics for the sleeve.

182
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:36,864
I just need you to write them down.
We can pop them off.

183
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,534
Get them off and we don't have
to worry about it.

184
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,577
No, no, we never write them down.

185
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:45,982
That's it.

186
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,420
What else did you sing after that?

187
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,656
Frankie.

188
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:57,725
Frank.

189
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,490
Frank!

190
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,526
What?

191
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,132
Have you got a condom?

192
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:07,566
- Have you got a condom?
- No, I'm not gonna fuck her.

193
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:09,898
I'm knackered.
I'm just gonna have a nosh.

194
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:34,152
<i>Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!</i>

195
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:03,108
<i>Well, denial is a river in Frank,</i>
<i>and it runs deep. </i>

196
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:08,923
<i>And his sets</i>
<i>were shambolic on times. </i>

197
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:13,654
Clearly, could only be the work
of a man who couldn't hear.

198
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,166
It wasn't pretty, but, you know,
for me...

199
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:06,104
...for someone that has gone
through something like that...

200
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:09,507
...to still get up there
and give it a go is a big thing.

201
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:18,142
<i>Off! Off! Off! Off!</i>

202
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:23,411
Let go, fuckers!

203
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,870
Fuckers!

204
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:39,219
Fucking fuckers!

205
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:26,164
- Because they dangle
when they're cold.

206
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:29,895
Yeah.
Now, listen very carefully, okay?

207
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:32,631
It's very important.
This is very important.

208
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:37,244
I have cancer, okay?
And I'm very delicate.

209
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,777
So they have to be very gentle.

210
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:42,512
- Hey, Frank.
- All right?

211
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:44,082
- How are you?
- All right.

212
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,774
- Attaboy.
- How you doing?

213
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,943
Good, good. Motherfucker.

214
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:51,454
Listen, I had that dream again.
I was sucking my own cock.

215
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,819
But this time,
I don't have a huge cock.

216
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,018
I have a normal-sized cock.
No spine. My spine disappears.

217
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:02,532
So my head, it just flops down
onto my... Anyway...

218
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,498
- You all right?
- Yeah. Sit down, sit down, sit down.

219
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:10,467
Look, I was just talking to the label...

220
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:13,769
...and they'd like to see
a couple of tracks.

221
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:18,043
The label would like
a couple of tracks, Frank.

222
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:20,841
- It's coming. It's coming.
- Yeah.

223
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:24,179
The tracks are coming, man, relax.
Don't worry, mate, it's fine.

224
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:27,322
- It's all right.
- I saw your show last night.

225
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,288
I tell you,
I really fucked up last night, man.

226
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:34,724
- It's my call. I picked the wrong set.
- It stunk. It stunk like shit, Frank.

227
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:38,161
It stunk like...
Well, like you shit your pants...

228
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,769
...and you just sat in it for a week,
and then you shit yourself again.

229
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:43,732
That's how fucking bad
it stunk, Frank.

230
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:47,038
- It was shit, yeah?
- It was shit, Frank. Yes, it was shit.

231
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,505
I tell you, the fucking monitors
at that place.

232
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:52,041
You know,
I'm fucking mixing my heart out.

233
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:55,044
I can't hear a fucking thing.
We gotta have words with them...

234
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:57,546
...get this sorted out,
otherwise we blow that place out.

235
00:25:57,717 --> 00:26:00,015
- I couldn't hear a fucking thing.
- Right.

236
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:01,948
Because you might be deaf, Frank.

237
00:26:02,754 --> 00:26:05,348
- What's that?
- You could be deaf, Frank.

238
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:07,355
- What you saying?
- You are deaf.

239
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:11,393
- Can't hear you, Max.
- You're fucking deaf, asshole!

240
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:15,122
Who the fuck you fooling, Frank?

241
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,767
You're talking like
a 95-year-old war vet.

242
00:26:18,335 --> 00:26:21,132
Frank, you need professional help.

243
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:27,735
I'm thinking about getting
some professional help.

244
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:30,472
Yeah.

245
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,407
Yeah.

246
00:26:41,355 --> 00:26:42,617
Fuck it.

247
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:11,472
Hello, Frank.

248
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:12,977
Come in, Frank.

249
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,712
Frank!

250
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:51,565
I don't want you to panic, Frank.

251
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:54,070
I've got some bad news
for you, though.

252
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:57,005
You're going deaf.
Completely deaf.

253
00:29:00,746 --> 00:29:03,738
As you know, your right ear
is completely shot.

254
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:08,852
Your left ear, that's this one,
has got 20 percent left.

255
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,648
You were born
with little holes in them...

256
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:14,621
...and slowly the fluid pressure
is dropping.

257
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:17,523
Can't you just plug it up
with some ear putty or something?

258
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,222
The ear organism, it's way too
sensitive and delicate for that.

259
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:24,299
Surgery doesn't work.
Cochlear implant doesn't work.

260
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:28,096
You've gotta stop exposing yourself
to so much noise.

261
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:29,568
What do you mean by that?

262
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:32,731
It means that if you listen
to absolute silence...

263
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:35,935
...your ears are gonna last
a little bit longer.

264
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:38,978
They're crumbling as we speak.

265
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,946
Stop the drugs, Frank.
Stop the drinking.

266
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:44,608
Go to bed at a decent hour.

267
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:47,754
We can give you a hearing aid
that gives you temporary hearing...

268
00:29:47,922 --> 00:29:50,152
...but that damages the ear
even further.

269
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:53,020
- Speak up.
- These are the facts, Frank.

270
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:56,526
These are the facts, Frank.
We can't change them.

271
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:59,062
You are deaf, man.

272
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:02,758
You are a deaf man.

273
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:06,496
This is costing me 2000
fucking euros an hour.

274
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,799
Chuck me a fucking bone!

275
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,101
This is your hearing aid, Frank.

276
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:15,609
Use it only when you have to.
Only when you have to.

277
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:21,009
- Only when I have to.
- Right. Only when you have to.

278
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,380
Got that? No exceptions.

279
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:31,654
Can you keep on gigging?

280
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,417
Frankie?

281
00:30:33,763 --> 00:30:36,254
Can you keep on gigging?

282
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,725
Can you keep on gigging?

283
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:46,435
I love them both, you know?

284
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:51,234
I love hearing, and I love DJ'ing.

285
00:30:57,217 --> 00:31:00,550
I was thinking this morning
maybe I should write a book.

286
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:02,846
That's a brilliant idea.

287
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:05,952
That might take years, though, so...

288
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:09,895
Perhaps, like, a pamphlet.
A sort of brochure thing.

289
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:11,661
Listen, Frankie, I...

290
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:16,299
I want to tell you that
whatever your decision...

291
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:19,665
...I will support it wholeheartedly.

292
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:23,102
You and me and little Kingie.

293
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,999
That's all that matters to me.

294
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:31,006
Deaf, dumb or blind, baby,
we will get through this.

295
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,276
It's brilliant to almost hear that.

296
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,552
<i>Fair play to the guy. </i>

297
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,745
<i>I have no idea what</i>
<i>I would have done in that situation. </i>

298
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:44,882
I mean, there he is.
You know, he's between a rock...

299
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,153
...and you know, another rock...

300
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:50,422
...which is harder and bigger.

301
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:49,772
Hi.

302
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,785
I'm actually thinking about
giving it a bit of a break.

303
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:01,951
Of course I fucking love you.

304
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:04,290
How can you say that?

305
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:09,265
I just think we don't necessarily
bring out the best in each other.

306
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:12,404
Not always the best thing for me.

307
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:15,233
It's my problem.
It's not your problem.

308
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:19,436
You know what I mean? Why can't we
just be mates for a little bit?

309
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:23,341
I could just give you a ring
every few weeks, you know?

310
00:33:23,514 --> 00:33:27,644
Just make it a little bit more casual.
Couldn't we do that?

311
00:34:38,414 --> 00:34:40,541
It sounds like the <i>caca. </i>

312
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:43,546
No.

313
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,753
Is Frank there?

314
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,714
Is this Frank standing
in front of me?

315
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:54,195
No, this is a drunken baboon
drooling on the mix board.

316
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:57,386
What in all of the heavens
are you on, Frank?

317
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:05,335
Are you fucking deaf
or something?

318
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:10,974
What's your fucking problem?

319
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:16,610
They would laugh you
out of Austria.

320
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,879
I can hear them laughing now.

321
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,077
Where is Frankie fucking Wilde,
Frankie?

322
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,056
Is he fucking gone?

323
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:31,025
And the fucking,
"Go away. Stay, stay, stay," huh?

324
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:49,871
So you're deaf?

325
00:35:53,848 --> 00:35:55,873
You're deaf?

326
00:35:57,886 --> 00:35:59,319
Almost.

327
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:06,323
This is like all the terrors
and the horrors of the world...

328
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:08,586
...raining down on your skull.

329
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:17,398
Last three months,
it's really rapidly accelerated.

330
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,130
But I've... I've got this.

331
00:36:20,306 --> 00:36:23,502
And I really thought
I could do this job, man.

332
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,133
I'll show you.

333
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,040
Hello, Mr. Drum!

334
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:29,908
Drummer!

335
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:36,979
The left ear,
there's still a little bit left.

336
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:40,621
And this little fella
is a fucking lifeline, man.

337
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:44,755
But I can use it only when I have to.

338
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,527
Long as I'm careful,
I can hear more.

339
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:26,122
- What? What has happened?
- What?

340
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,984
<i>He was stone-fucking deaf. </i>

341
00:39:05,153 --> 00:39:08,987
<i>There's not much you can do as a DJ</i>
<i>if you can't hear. </i>

342
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:11,952
Generally, the field of music...

343
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:15,322
...other than the obvious example...

344
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:19,090
...has been dominated
by people who can hear.

345
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,924
He was never gonna hear again.

346
00:39:22,101 --> 00:39:25,764
It was as simple as that. It was...

347
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,061
...gone.

348
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,002
All right, Frankie?

349
00:41:23,343 --> 00:41:25,038
All right?

350
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:28,844
Blink!

351
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,673
<i>Hola,</i> mate.

352
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,778
- All right?
- All right.

353
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:36,252
Good game?

354
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:40,186
- Is it a good game?
- Yeah, it's all right. It's pretty good.

355
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:41,791
It's decent.

356
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:48,230
Sonya in?

357
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:49,729
Sonya in?

358
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:52,527
Yeah, she's here. She's upstairs.

359
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:54,761
- She's packing, mate.
- She all right?

360
00:41:55,271 --> 00:41:56,738
She's leaving you, Frank.

361
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:58,771
She's leaving you.

362
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:00,465
For me.

363
00:42:06,382 --> 00:42:08,111
- Get in there!
- Did you see that?

364
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:09,874
Fucking hell!

365
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:14,147
Fucking, how was that one, eh?
Ter-fucking-rific!

366
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:18,124
- Yes, brilliant, wasn't it?
- Want a line?

367
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,555
Not right now, thanks. Cheers.

368
00:42:25,866 --> 00:42:26,992
Frankie.

369
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,466
- You all right?
- Yeah.

370
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:48,017
I'm leaving you.

371
00:42:49,553 --> 00:42:52,522
I'm gonna take the tiger.
That's mine.

372
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:55,919
And I want those ones,
obviously, because they're mine.

373
00:42:56,092 --> 00:43:00,654
And you can have the sculpture
that your mother bought us.

374
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:05,429
Aren't you upset, Frankie?

375
00:43:07,602 --> 00:43:10,435
Do you wanna say anything to me?
Anything at all?

376
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,321
Frankie!

377
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:46,636
Where the fuck's the album, Frank?

378
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:52,139
Where the fuck
is the album, Frank?!

379
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:56,743
Where the fuck is the album?!

380
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,153
It smells like shit in here, Frank.

381
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:13,191
What the fuck's happened to you?

382
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,228
What the fuck happened
to you, Frank?

383
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:18,966
I don't know what this is.
I don't know what this is.

384
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,930
This is bullshit, Frank. This isn't
how you take on things, huh?

385
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:25,833
Listen...

386
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:30,674
Maybe this isn't the worst thing
in the world.

387
00:44:30,843 --> 00:44:32,367
Take some fucking time off.

388
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,605
Go in the sun for fuck's sakes, huh?

389
00:44:36,749 --> 00:44:39,478
Eat a lot of fruit,
get some fucking vitamins in you.

390
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:42,848
Vegetables and greens and shit.
I can't...

391
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,817
You know, there's...
I was reading yesterday...

392
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:50,517
...there's a fish,
it's called a zebra fish.

393
00:44:51,295 --> 00:44:53,286
Has little hairs on it.

394
00:44:53,497 --> 00:44:56,523
And somehow,
they can implant that...

395
00:44:59,602 --> 00:45:00,967
I don't know.

396
00:45:01,871 --> 00:45:03,361
It's too fucking hot.

397
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,072
It's always too fucking hot.

398
00:45:10,245 --> 00:45:12,372
I can't help you.

399
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:15,940
I don't know how to...

400
00:45:16,117 --> 00:45:20,417
I don't know how to help... - I don't
want to help you. I can't help you.

401
00:45:23,591 --> 00:45:26,855
<i>I didn't want a deaf DJ</i>
<i>on the label. </i>

402
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:31,361
<i>I didn't want the company to be</i>
<i>touched with the deaf stamp. </i>

403
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:32,896
Well, business is tough...

404
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,659
...and sometimes you have
to make awkward decisions.

405
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:40,134
And I've made harder decisions
than dropping the deaf DJ.

406
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:46,062
<i>Frank just locks himself up</i>
<i>in his room... </i>

407
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:48,461
<i>... didn't come out</i>
<i>of his villa for a long time. </i>

408
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:51,124
<i>He had this theory he was gonna</i>
<i>get his hearing back... </i>

409
00:46:51,302 --> 00:46:54,567
<i>... by having complete silence. He</i>
<i>wanted to rest his ears completely. </i>

410
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:57,833
<i>He hired people to bring in supplies</i>
<i>for him to the villa. </i>

411
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:00,568
<i>The only accounts we have</i>
<i>of Frank during this period... </i>

412
00:47:00,744 --> 00:47:02,473
...come from various drug dealers.

413
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:04,307
He was in a very dark place.

414
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,151
I love you too.

415
00:52:48,988 --> 00:52:52,754
- <i>Where is Frankie Wilde today?</i>
- <i>What? I haven't</i>...

416
00:52:52,925 --> 00:52:56,690
<i>I haven't talked to him</i>
<i>in almost a year now. </i>

417
00:52:56,861 --> 00:53:00,092
<i>I've heard some stories. This guy</i>
<i>supposedly saw him in New York... </i>

418
00:53:00,265 --> 00:53:05,396
...wearing a garbage bag for a hat
and shoeboxes on his feet.

419
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:09,403
And he... And he had a rock...

420
00:53:09,573 --> 00:53:12,337
...and he was trying to eat it
like a sandwich.

421
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:15,773
I don't...
I don't think Frankie would do that.

422
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:18,209
He looked like a bum.
He always looked like a bum.

423
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:20,815
But he had a really special bond
with the homeless.

424
00:53:57,082 --> 00:53:58,379
Hello.

425
00:54:06,257 --> 00:54:07,281
Hello?

426
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:08,720
Hello.

427
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:13,362
Is this where you come if you
want to learn how to read lips?

428
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,294
Of course. You want to learn?

429
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:22,827
I've got no idea
what you're saying, darling.

430
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:25,764
I can't hear anything.
This is the place, yeah?

431
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,210
They look like a couple of cunts.

432
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,862
I don't know how to lip read.

433
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:56,597
Maybe you should
write something down.

434
00:54:56,769 --> 00:55:00,226
I can't hear you, and I can't read lips.
So we need to get started somehow.

435
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:03,306
So, maybe, write something down.

436
00:55:23,326 --> 00:55:25,191
Temper, temper.

437
00:55:25,995 --> 00:55:27,655
Watch.

438
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,661
Concentrate.

439
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:32,463
Watch my lips.

440
00:55:34,002 --> 00:55:35,264
Watch...

441
00:55:35,437 --> 00:55:37,267
...lips.

442
00:55:42,343 --> 00:55:44,072
Tongue.

443
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:47,178
Jaw.

444
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,616
One's facial expression...

445
00:55:52,986 --> 00:55:54,919
...gesture.

446
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:57,452
Lip reading...

447
00:55:57,623 --> 00:55:59,784
...is about seeing...

448
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:01,517
...feeling.

449
00:56:10,135 --> 00:56:13,036
Fill in the blanks, Frank.

450
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:31,379
Stepdad.

451
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:37,185
Husband.

452
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:47,890
The quick brown fox.

453
00:56:48,836 --> 00:56:50,360
- The.
- The.

454
00:56:50,538 --> 00:56:52,505
- Quick.
- Quick.

455
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:54,970
- <i>Brown. </i>
- Brown.

456
00:56:55,141 --> 00:56:57,234
- <i>Fox. </i>
- Fox.

457
00:56:58,244 --> 00:57:03,681
- <i>Jumps over the lazy... </i>
- Over the lazy dog.

458
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:05,214
Faster.

459
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,784
The quick brown fox...

460
00:57:07,953 --> 00:57:10,284
...jumps over the lazy dog.

461
00:57:10,454 --> 00:57:12,217
Good.

462
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,857
Good.

463
00:57:14,959 --> 00:57:16,620
Fucking good.

464
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,728
They all speak English here.

465
00:57:22,933 --> 00:57:24,332
Don't worry.

466
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:33,471
Scotch neat, please, mate.

467
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,969
Double Scotch neat.

468
00:57:39,113 --> 00:57:42,082
- Is that okay?
- It's very good.

469
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,882
See what he comes back with.

470
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:51,153
To my lips.

471
00:57:52,726 --> 00:57:54,023
Cheers.

472
00:58:02,101 --> 00:58:04,001
You and me got the same hobby.

473
00:58:09,074 --> 00:58:10,905
Another one?

474
00:58:12,944 --> 00:58:15,003
What can I get you?

475
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:20,649
Scotch neat, please.

476
00:58:21,785 --> 00:58:23,878
Double Scotch again.

477
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:29,487
In England, it means "fuck off. "
Very similar gesture.

478
00:58:29,659 --> 00:58:32,355
Fuck off. Double.

479
00:58:32,929 --> 00:58:34,294
Double fuck off.

480
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:35,927
Waiter!

481
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:40,193
Double Scotch, please, mate.

482
00:58:54,547 --> 00:58:56,538
No, more.

483
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,884
What do you want to drink to?
Do you want to drink to something?

484
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:07,183
Who's Simon?

485
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,826
Silence.

486
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:12,825
- Who is he?
- Not Simon, silence.

487
00:59:13,064 --> 00:59:15,362
- Are you finished with him?
- Good.

488
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,000
Great.

489
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:14,917
I know what I could do.

490
01:00:14,952 --> 01:00:15,816
I know what I could do.

491
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,386
I know what I could do.

492
01:00:17,556 --> 01:00:19,785
Fuck the DJ lark.

493
01:00:19,957 --> 01:00:23,654
You know on TV,
you got a little ugly bird...

494
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:27,285
...bottom right-hand corner,
doing all this business?

495
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:29,261
I could do that.
I could be a cool one.

496
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:32,196
A cool little fucker
in the corner of the box. I could.

497
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:34,496
Think positively.

498
01:00:35,105 --> 01:00:37,197
Yeah. "Are you going down
to Pacha tonight?"

499
01:00:37,373 --> 01:00:41,207
"Oh, no, mate. No, I'm staying in
because Frankie Wilde's...

500
01:00:41,377 --> 01:00:43,937
...at the right-hand bottom corner
of the TV tonight...

501
01:00:44,113 --> 01:00:46,979
...doing the fucking hand jive.
It'll be brilliant. "

502
01:00:54,622 --> 01:00:56,418
You finish?

503
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:04,891
You finish?

504
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:09,229
There's nothing wrong
with being deaf.

505
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:10,892
I'm deaf.

506
01:01:11,404 --> 01:01:13,099
Trust your other senses.

507
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:16,638
Your sight,
your smell and your touch.

508
01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:19,099
Just relax.

509
01:01:19,878 --> 01:01:21,607
It will come.

510
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,970
It just takes time.

511
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:26,010
It will come.

512
01:06:31,122 --> 01:06:34,318
<i>Well, Frank's system was ingenious,</i>
<i>and with the weight of his sight... </i>

513
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:37,392
<i>... he proclaims that he began</i>
<i>to see a rhythm in everything... </i>

514
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,791
...a pattern in the visual world
around him.

515
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:42,363
<i>You know, could see music. </i>

516
01:08:07,775 --> 01:08:10,243
<i>Frankie had worked with this</i>
<i>all his life... </i>

517
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,777
<i>... and then he realized</i>
<i>he was able to piece together... </i>

518
01:08:13,947 --> 01:08:17,177
<i>... those sets</i>
<i>that he used to do. And... </i>

519
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:21,810
Hey, presto, you know,
four to the floor, returneth.

520
01:09:11,098 --> 01:09:14,999
I once stole 500 quid
from your wallet, in the studio.

521
01:09:15,168 --> 01:09:16,635
Well...

522
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:19,667
...it's only money, eh? No big deal.

523
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,899
And it was me
who stuck that scaff bar...

524
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,235
...through the windscreen
of your Merc.

525
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,107
- It wasn't that Asian kid.
- Well, he's probably out now anyway...

526
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,544
...so no harm done.

527
01:09:32,717 --> 01:09:34,344
I shagged Twila.

528
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:41,158
For three years.

529
01:09:56,973 --> 01:09:59,464
Because you're a mate, yeah...

530
01:10:00,775 --> 01:10:03,573
...I only ever made love
to her bum.

531
01:10:06,014 --> 01:10:08,073
She doesn't like it in the bum.

532
01:10:09,516 --> 01:10:12,713
Have a listen to this.
Tell me what you think.

533
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:14,286
Yeah?

534
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:28,066
Open the door! Frank!

535
01:10:28,234 --> 01:10:30,724
Frank! Open the fucking door!

536
01:10:30,903 --> 01:10:33,167
Open the door! Frank!

537
01:10:33,338 --> 01:10:36,432
Frank! Open the fucking door!

538
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:38,598
Do you want some more coffee?

539
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:44,107
Frank! Frank! Open the door.
Open the fucking door.

540
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:47,143
- So?
- Oh, Frank. Oh, God.

541
01:10:47,317 --> 01:10:48,784
- Yeah?
- Oh, God, it's good,

542
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:50,886
- Fucking good.
- It's good?

543
01:10:51,054 --> 01:10:53,022
Okay, it's fucking hot.

544
01:10:53,223 --> 01:10:55,919
First off, did you...? Who's this?

545
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:58,650
Max, this is Penelope.
Penelope, this is Max.

546
01:10:58,827 --> 01:10:59,953
Hi, Max.

547
01:11:01,163 --> 01:11:02,391
Hi.

548
01:11:05,267 --> 01:11:08,258
Forget it.
Look, Did you mix this?

549
01:11:08,903 --> 01:11:10,871
- Yeah.
- Did you produce this?

550
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:13,405
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

551
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:16,709
Fuck it, Frank. It's gold.
Fucking gold.

552
01:11:18,245 --> 01:11:19,439
It's beautiful.

553
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:21,547
Tell me! I haven't heard it.

554
01:11:21,715 --> 01:11:25,616
It gets in your fucking chest. I've never
heard nothing like it. Fucking:

555
01:11:25,785 --> 01:11:28,447
Like fucking heart. It changed...

556
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:32,284
What...? What do you mean you
haven't heard it? What do you mean?

557
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:34,725
Well, I haven't heard it.

558
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,186
Why?

559
01:11:38,964 --> 01:11:41,489
I'm completely deaf, Max.

560
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,631
Completely?

561
01:11:49,173 --> 01:11:50,765
Yeah.

562
01:11:51,275 --> 01:11:52,503
Nothing.

563
01:11:55,178 --> 01:11:57,078
To the handicapped.

564
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,684
Sorry.

565
01:12:09,524 --> 01:12:12,856
The first time I heard
<i>Hear No Evil... </i>

566
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:15,860
...I was like, you know, "Whatever. "

567
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,761
But then Max told me
Frankie's story...

568
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:23,026
<i>... and the penny dropped. </i>

569
01:12:34,847 --> 01:12:38,078
<i>People love a good tragedy. </i>

570
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:41,184
People love handicaps, frankly.

571
01:12:42,186 --> 01:12:44,552
It gets them emotional, you know.

572
01:12:44,722 --> 01:12:47,953
So I'll get on that deaf train
with a wheelchair ramp.

573
01:12:48,126 --> 01:12:51,390
No problem.
First-class ticket, please.

574
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:20,976
<i>I don't see why we should limit</i>
<i>ourselves to deaf people, really. </i>

575
01:13:21,155 --> 01:13:23,646
I don't want to reveal
too much either...

576
01:13:23,924 --> 01:13:26,824
...about where we're going.
But it's gonna be big.

577
01:13:26,993 --> 01:13:29,291
It's gonna be big,
and it's gonna be handicapped.

578
01:13:29,462 --> 01:13:31,044
Imagine all the deaf people,
all the deaf people in the world.

579
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:32,626
Imagine all the deaf people,
all the deaf people in the world.

580
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:34,232
They need a fucking hero, Frank.

581
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,095
They don't have a fucking hero.
There's no deaf hero, huh?

582
01:13:37,269 --> 01:13:38,395
It's you, Frank.

583
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:41,403
You're, like, the fucking link.

584
01:13:41,573 --> 01:13:46,236
You're drawing all the deaf kids
that are screaming, with no hearing.

585
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,640
They're yelling out to...
Who's gonna listen?

586
01:13:48,813 --> 01:13:52,112
Not other fucking deaf kids.
They can't hear, huh? You.

587
01:13:52,283 --> 01:13:55,183
You're the fucking voice, eh?
And wait.

588
01:13:55,351 --> 01:13:58,514
Wait. You're gonna love this.

589
01:14:00,323 --> 01:14:03,349
Can you hear me?
"No, I can't hear you, Max.

590
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:06,688
Are you trying to make me money?"
Yes. I'm making you money. Okay.

591
01:14:06,862 --> 01:14:08,159
Fuck, look...

592
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:11,788
...that is just the fucking beginning.

593
01:14:29,282 --> 01:14:33,012
I wouldn't put my name to any
old product. If I could describe it...

594
01:14:34,587 --> 01:14:36,680
...as bad speed in a can.

595
01:14:36,856 --> 01:14:38,517
We've all had bad speed,
haven't we?

596
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:41,125
I'm just gonna have a sip.
I can't resist.

597
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:43,085
Fuck.

598
01:14:44,462 --> 01:14:47,431
He made disabilities cool.

599
01:14:50,401 --> 01:14:52,197
What's with the fucking ear?

600
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:55,964
The ear, that represents
your deafness, okay.

601
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,973
Deaf people hate their ears, see.
Don't they? See?

602
01:14:59,143 --> 01:15:01,167
So it's symbolic.
So you're gonna smash it.

603
01:15:01,344 --> 01:15:05,303
The deaf kids are gonna go fucking
nuts. Don't actually hit the ear...

604
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:08,507
...because I'll put some glass on that
and turn that into a table.

605
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:12,084
It's wank. I'm sucking
deaf cock for you, mate...

606
01:15:12,254 --> 01:15:17,055
...and I'm fucking choking on it.
- All right, first off, okay...

607
01:15:17,225 --> 01:15:18,749
...you're sucking show-biz cock.

608
01:15:18,927 --> 01:15:22,589
But look, this is gonna be
good money. This is all about cash.

609
01:15:22,763 --> 01:15:25,527
Shitloads of cash, Frank.
And better than that...

610
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:29,065
...Sonya can't get her grubby fingers
on this fucking money, understand?

611
01:15:29,235 --> 01:15:32,432
- This is Sonya-free cash.
- He's not a whore!

612
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:39,843
Look, Frank, okay?

613
01:15:40,546 --> 01:15:43,276
You're not giving me any
fucking positive feedback.

614
01:15:43,448 --> 01:15:46,576
I need fucking... You know what really
fucking bothers me about you?

615
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:48,981
The fact that you think art
just fucking happens.

616
01:15:49,153 --> 01:15:51,519
It's just free.
Like these people just took out...

617
01:15:51,689 --> 01:15:54,249
...time from their fucking day
to come down here...

618
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:57,359
...and do a bunch of shit for nothing.
What you gotta realize...

619
01:15:57,527 --> 01:15:59,961
...is you're a hero.
That's what the yellow's about.

620
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:02,690
You make fun of me on that jacket.
I picked that jacket.

621
01:16:02,866 --> 01:16:05,664
Deaf kids all over the world
are gonna see that yellow.

622
01:16:05,835 --> 01:16:08,997
They'll run out, they'll buy that jacket.
Two, maybe $300.

623
01:16:09,171 --> 01:16:11,071
They're gonna run around,
proudly deaf...

624
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,765
...all just yellow,
fluorescently deaf...

625
01:16:29,489 --> 01:16:31,013
Sit down.

626
01:16:31,491 --> 01:16:33,857
Charlize Bondo, <i>Ibiza Beat. </i>

627
01:16:34,027 --> 01:16:36,961
Frankie, can you really DJ
as a deaf man?

628
01:16:37,129 --> 01:16:38,960
How is that possible?

629
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,464
- They murmuring?
- Yeah, quite a bit.

630
01:16:43,636 --> 01:16:45,432
I'm an honest man.

631
01:16:45,604 --> 01:16:48,664
And I can tell you
that this album was made...

632
01:16:50,342 --> 01:16:53,640
...completely without the aid
of my ears.

633
01:16:54,278 --> 01:16:58,840
And at Pacha next week,
I'll be DJ'ing as a deaf man.

634
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:02,949
And if you don't believe me...

635
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:05,946
...you know, fuck you...

636
01:17:07,257 --> 01:17:12,284
...because I've got nothing,
nothing to prove...

637
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:17,023
...to you sluts at all.
- Okay. Okay. Role model.

638
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,500
- Nothing.
- Wait a minute. Okay, role model.

639
01:17:21,836 --> 01:17:24,828
Listen. Listen to me. No. No.

640
01:17:25,006 --> 01:17:27,372
He loves sluts. Frank loves sluts.

641
01:17:27,975 --> 01:17:30,535
Now, I think what
he's trying to say is...

642
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:33,736
...even though he feels
he has nothing to prove to you...

643
01:17:33,913 --> 01:17:40,182
...he'd be happy to prove
anything you want, to you.

644
01:17:40,552 --> 01:17:45,512
It's important that we all realize that
this is a major comeback from a rock.

645
01:17:45,691 --> 01:17:50,457
You know, what he's accomplished
in the last few months is astonishing.

646
01:17:50,628 --> 01:17:53,529
He'll be at the Pacha nightclub.
You can come down...

647
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:56,166
...and watch him mix yourself...

648
01:17:56,334 --> 01:17:58,734
...and watch the miracle
happen, okay?

649
01:17:58,903 --> 01:18:03,202
Because, you know, I realize, okay,
that there are doubters in this room...

650
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:06,342
...which fucks me up.
Because, you know...

651
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:09,205
...why would someone
pretend to be deaf?

652
01:18:09,378 --> 01:18:12,643
I mean, that's retarded.
That's ridic...

653
01:18:12,815 --> 01:18:17,275
It's not like he's fucking benefiting
from this. It's a fucking obstacle.

654
01:18:17,453 --> 01:18:19,852
He can't hear a fuck...
Your mom's a cunt. Nothing.

655
01:18:20,021 --> 01:18:23,548
Zero. Blank. This man,
what he's done, fucking...

656
01:18:23,725 --> 01:18:27,660
It gets me in my fucking heart,
what he's done. And you...

657
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:31,889
You come down here, and you
put on this big fucking show...

658
01:18:32,066 --> 01:18:34,091
...like he's gonna
fucking make shit up!

659
01:18:34,268 --> 01:18:36,634
Relax. Relax, man.

660
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:38,764
All right. Next question.

661
01:18:39,138 --> 01:18:41,197
One more! One more!

662
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,185
I thought it was amazing,
you know, that somebody...

663
01:18:55,354 --> 01:18:58,754
...that's deaf can actually...
Can actually...

664
01:18:58,923 --> 01:19:00,515
...you know, be a DJ.

665
01:19:00,691 --> 01:19:03,057
- Frankie Wilde, good luck.
- Good luck.

666
01:19:03,227 --> 01:19:07,492
I just think that guy is so fantastic.
He has a gift that no one else has.

667
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:10,098
And somehow, he is gonna do it.

668
01:19:27,615 --> 01:19:29,845
<i>Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!</i>

669
01:19:36,723 --> 01:19:38,623
<i>The vibe that night</i>
<i>was incredible. </i>

670
01:19:39,059 --> 01:19:42,619
All the memories had come back,
you know. He'd hit the depths...

671
01:19:42,795 --> 01:19:45,161
<i>... then he was just back. </i>

672
01:20:00,145 --> 01:20:02,044
Pacha, Frankie Wilde, comeback.

673
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,870
"Take this. Check this out. "

674
01:20:05,048 --> 01:20:07,516
I've never seen an atmosphere
like it. It was amazing.

675
01:20:08,952 --> 01:20:11,181
<i>Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!</i>

676
01:22:12,162 --> 01:22:14,755
<i>He probably never thought</i>
<i>he'd ever feel that again. </i>

677
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:17,798
And to come back
and actually feel that and more...

678
01:22:18,801 --> 01:22:21,429
<i>... it was a great experience. </i>
<i>Everybody in the room... </i>

679
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:24,538
<i>... shared the same experience. </i>
<i>It was really, really special. </i>

680
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,106
<i>It was kind of what</i>
<i>dance music's about, really. </i>

681
01:22:34,682 --> 01:22:37,150
He just had clubland sparking,
bigtime.

682
01:22:48,094 --> 01:22:50,493
He just took the roof
off the place. It was amazing.

683
01:22:50,663 --> 01:22:52,927
It was like
he was an even better DJ...

684
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:56,033
<i>... as a deaf man than he'd</i>
<i>been before. It was incredible. </i>

685
01:23:04,842 --> 01:23:07,970
Frankie! Frankie!
We won it! Listen!

686
01:23:08,146 --> 01:23:10,238
Fuck! We're the fucking champions!

687
01:23:10,414 --> 01:23:12,405
We got the fucking award!

688
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:16,577
This is it.
This is our fucking moment!

689
01:23:17,921 --> 01:23:19,945
There's nothing... I can't... Fuck.

690
01:23:20,122 --> 01:23:21,749
What do you wanna do,
buy the moon?

691
01:23:21,924 --> 01:23:25,325
We'll buy the moon! Doesn't matter.
You don't understand, it's huge.

692
01:23:25,494 --> 01:23:27,018
Hold on.

693
01:23:33,969 --> 01:23:36,301
Okay, they're gonna come in.
Fifteen minutes.

694
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:38,461
They all wanna talk to you.
Fifteen minutes.

695
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,005
Fifteen minutes, Frank.
This is a big moment.

696
01:23:41,175 --> 01:23:44,042
Listen, it's important.
Fifteen minutes. That's all they need.

697
01:23:44,211 --> 01:23:46,179
Tomorrow,
big, fucking press conference.

698
01:23:46,347 --> 01:23:48,974
That's what we're gonna do.
Very important, okay?

699
01:23:49,148 --> 01:23:50,581
- You have to watch.
- Max?

700
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,014
- What? What?
- Can you do me a favor, mate?

701
01:23:53,186 --> 01:23:55,154
Anything. Anything.

702
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:57,117
Could you leave us alone
for 10 minutes?

703
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:59,757
No. See, you're not listening.
Okay, listen to me.

704
01:23:59,925 --> 01:24:01,517
Look at my lips, okay? Okay?

705
01:24:01,693 --> 01:24:04,821
They come in for 15 minutes
of your life. Fifteen minutes.

706
01:24:05,097 --> 01:24:07,189
Fifteen fucking minutes. Frank.

707
01:24:07,365 --> 01:24:10,163
No, no, no, no. Frank, no.
No. Frank.

708
01:24:12,103 --> 01:24:14,798
Frank, 10 minutes. Ten minutes.

709
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,564
Ten minutes.

710
01:24:22,879 --> 01:24:24,402
Sure. Okay.

711
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:28,641
Yeah. Fucking sure.
What the fuck do I know?

712
01:24:43,563 --> 01:24:45,463
Okay, now. All right, now.
Calm down.

713
01:24:45,632 --> 01:24:47,759
Okay, you're getting in, buddy.
Don't worry.

714
01:24:47,934 --> 01:24:51,426
You I used to like. All right.
You could do with some cheering up.

715
01:24:51,605 --> 01:24:54,505
All right. Okay. Hold on. Okay.

716
01:24:58,077 --> 01:24:59,806
Frankie?

717
01:25:01,714 --> 01:25:03,044
Frankie!

718
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,292
Jesus Christ.

719
01:25:29,138 --> 01:25:30,604
Frankie!

720
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:37,601
Frank! Fuck.

721
01:26:29,959 --> 01:26:33,520
There was like a flat line.

722
01:26:33,996 --> 01:26:35,792
It was...

723
01:26:36,698 --> 01:26:38,962
Still, to this day, I'm...

724
01:26:41,336 --> 01:26:44,567
That was it, gone.
Frankie Wilde, bye-bye. Gone.

725
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:47,537
And everybody was like that:
Holding the baby.

726
01:27:17,001 --> 01:27:20,493
<i>I've heard a story that he's running</i>
<i>a record shop in Oxford</i>.

727
01:27:20,671 --> 01:27:24,197
There's a story that he went to Fiji
and then died of syphilis.

728
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:27,309
But nobody knows. You know,
I don't know where he is.

729
01:27:27,644 --> 01:27:31,341
He was another deaf guy
with a deaf guy's needs.

730
01:27:31,948 --> 01:27:34,245
And he went off...

731
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,611
...to a quiet place.

732
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:39,510
Although, I suppose that
wouldn't make much difference.
