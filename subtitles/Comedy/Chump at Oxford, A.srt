1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,955
Go!

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,629
Go!

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,669
What's that?

4
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,509
It's a man!

5
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,471
- What? Is he dead?
- No, sir.

6
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,272
He's writing!

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,475
Repeat!

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,030
He's writing,

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,919
sir, he's writing in a notebook!

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,072
That man was not mad.
He was working

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,869
with shrapnel whistling round him
because he couldn't wait.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,680
The contents of that notebook
were too important

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,398
to write it down later.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,199
He had to do it
when his mind dictated,

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,828
he couldn't put it off
a single second.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,231
What was so important that
he would risk his life for it?

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,638
What was he writing that
stopped him from standing up

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,552
and running, like any other man
would have done?

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,071
The "Tractatus
Logico-philosophicus",

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,989
the most influential philosophical
work of the twentieth century.

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,432
That soldier was called
Ludwig Wittgenstein,

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,160
the man who set the limits
on our thoughts.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,674
The enigma that
he tried to decipher

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,548
was the following:

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,994
Can we know the truth?

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,552
All the great thinkers
throughout history

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,392
have sought a single certainty,

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,391
something which
no one can refute,

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,949
like "two and two make four".

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,871
In order to find that truth,

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,871
Wittgenstein used, in fact,

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,192
mathematical logic. What better
means of obtaining a certainty

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,750
than an immutable language,
free from the passions of men?

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,034
He advanced slowly,
using equation after equation,

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,839
with impeccable method,
until he reached

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,758
a terrifying conclusion.

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,028
There is no such truth

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,475
outside of mathematics.

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,558
There is no way of finding

40
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,995
a single absolute truth,

41
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,957
an irrefutable argument

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,317
which might help answer
the questions of mankind.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,792
Philosophy,
therefore, is dead.

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,114
Because "Whereof we cannot speak,

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,554
thereof we must be silent. "

46
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,838
Don't touch that, please.

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,793
This is an Enigma machine!

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,316
Just a copy. The original's in
the Imperial War Museum in London.

49
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,270
Sorry to sneak in like that...
The door was open.

50
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,989
Of course it was open. You surely
didn't expect me to get up

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,639
and let you in
on these legs, did you?

52
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,035
I'm...

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,792
Martin, our new overseas
student lodger, I presume.

54
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,190
- This man in the photo with you...
- Yes.

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,351
That's Turing, Alan Turing,

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,235
the man who deciphered
the Enigma code.

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,392
Thanks to him, we won the war.

58
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,596
Poor man died
such a strange death...

59
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,392
a poisoned apple, like Snow White.

60
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,919
And the one on the left?

61
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,991
My husband, Harry.

62
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,197
Harry Eagleton. He developed the
concept of fractional dimensions...

63
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,397
He deserved a bloody Nobel prize,
but he hated sucking up

64
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,949
to politicians.
Politicians or anybody.

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,394
He never had many friends.

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,595
He had one at least.
Arthur Seldom.

67
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,830
Poor boy. He spent day

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,673
after day in the house,
tidying Harry's papers.

69
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,355
He'd go without lunch or dinner,
going over the equations.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,675
Eagleton tutored his doctoral thesis
on the logical series. In 1960,

71
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,718
- wasn't it?
- I see you've done your homework.

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,349
I know everything there is
to know about Arthur Seldom.

73
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,715
In fact, Mrs. Eagleton,
it's because of him that I'm here.

74
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,393
In Oxford, I mean.

75
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,993
I know what you mean.
Seldom is... unique.

76
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,638
Every prize,
every acknowledgement

77
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,998
he's received over the years
has been a real joy for me.

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,916
Careful, mother, or
your secret will be discovered.

79
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,115
What secret?

80
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,872
After daddy died,
you tried to marry him.

81
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,873
How dare you!
That's not true.

82
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,314
He's always been
like a brother to me.

83
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,357
Only because there was no chance
of him being anything else.

84
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,555
Beth!

85
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,391
There's no doubt
Professor Seldom is a genius,

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,676
but there's one area
he's no different from other men.

87
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,153
He likes young girls.

88
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,915
Beth, darling, couldn't you stop
being so spiteful just for a second?

89
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,195
Sorry, mother.

90
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,073
Take no notice of us.
We're like two bitter old spinsters.

91
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,311
Thank you, mother, for tarring me
with the same brush.

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,230
I'm sorry,

93
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,515
you are...?

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,314
I sent a fax a few weeks ago,
about renting a room.

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,118
Ah, our overseas student.

96
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,918
Why don't you
show him to his room?

97
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,233
If I'd known,
I'd have rented a tux.

98
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,874
You look stunning.

99
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,315
My daughter has
a concert tonight. That's all.

100
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,676
A concert?

101
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,115
I play the cello
in the Sheldonian.

102
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,396
- It's the local amateur orchestra.
- Yes.

103
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,835
We're not quite
the London Symphony.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,115
I... I love the cello.

105
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,477
Me too. Maybe it's because
it's all I get to cuddle

106
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,709
- these days.
- Beth.

107
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,233
Please.
You'll scare the young man.

108
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,355
Mother.

109
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,591
My daughter's suitors
tend not to be

110
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,079
around very long.

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,389
Difficult character, you know.

112
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,793
Having an old lady hovering in the
door way doesn't exactly help either.

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,315
Are you calling me a busybody?

114
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,789
No, mother. You just want
to protect me, don't you?

115
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,435
Of course.

116
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,829
My mother has this theory

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,116
that unless a man lived
through the Second World War

118
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,713
he's not to be trusted.

119
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,596
My daughter

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,795
thinks I've gone a bit

121
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,188
gaga, but she knows

122
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,156
I'm right.

123
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,751
The Nazis changed the wheels

124
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,832
on that damned machine
every bloody day,

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,390
that altered the code, and we
had to decipher it all over again.

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,031
There were no computers
in those days,

127
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,829
calculations were done by hand.

128
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,239
You must have been very young.

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,549
Time for me to go.

130
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,919
Fancy a game of Scrabble?

131
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,915
Well, this is your study.

132
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,157
I trust you'll be comfortable.

133
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,355
It's perfect.

134
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,988
You should also be thinking
of a supervisor

135
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,149
for your thesis.

136
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,232
I've had one in mind
for a long time; Arthur Seldom.

137
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,355
Your parents?

138
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,509
Yeah.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,275
Very American.
Is it close to the beach?

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,194
Not at all.
It's the desert, Arizona.

141
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,913
It actually happens to be my home.

142
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,075
Really? Lovely.

143
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,029
Anyway...

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,593
all the studies are shared.

145
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,190
Your colleague is
also an overseas student.

146
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,918
I'm sure we'll get on fine.

147
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,350
By the way,

148
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,479
I think you'll find Professor Seldom
only works as a researcher now.

149
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,873
I know, but the college told me that
he could supervise my doctorate.

150
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,439
Who told you that?

151
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,518
I've got a fax...

152
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,431
here.

153
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,155
I see.

154
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,918
I'm sorry to say Mrs. Keeman

155
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,111
was being rather over-optimistic.
Also,

156
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,429
she no longer works here.

157
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,830
But there must be some way,
perhaps if I speak to him...

158
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,354
You're free to talk
to whoever you want,

159
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,308
of course, but I must
warn you Professor Seldom

160
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,233
is not one for
this sort of spontaneity.

161
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,958
If you take my advice,

162
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,032
I suggest you approach your studies
in a more realistic way.

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,078
I'm sure you'll find some excellent
tutors among our teaching staff

164
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,318
who will more than understand
the nature of your work.

165
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,151
- Don't take it out on the wall.
- Walls?

166
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,035
Don't talk to me about walls. That's
all you get in this fucking city.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,956
Sorry, just letting off
a little steam.

168
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,873
Well, at least they come in
handy for doing your homework.

169
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,993
These? I was just trying to save
myself 15 years of practice.

170
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,038
See, I'm trying to calculate
where I need to run,

171
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,469
depending on where
the ball bounces,

172
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,232
and what height it makes contact

173
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,037
with my racquet.

174
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,671
Makes it easier. Here.

175
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,793
See? It works.

176
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,997
Yeah, and what would happen
if you played against a person?

177
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,393
There would be more variables

178
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,512
but it would still be possible
to work out the trajectory.

179
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,235
Please.

180
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,274
Give me time.

181
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,990
I have to rethink my calculations.

182
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,755
Okay.

183
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,155
Thanks for the beating.

184
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,233
Do you want to continue
letting off steam

185
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,753
on your own
or do you prefer company?

186
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,278
Wednesday, same time?

187
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,069
Yes. Bring a proper squash racquet.
Makes life much easier.

188
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,115
Okay.

189
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,637
I see you're picking up
the local customs very quickly.

190
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,074
I try my best.

191
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,037
Maybe she can help you
with your doctoral thesis,

192
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,395
since uncle Arthur
is out of the question.

193
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,153
- Can nothing be done?
- No.

194
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,474
And if you're suggesting my mother
have a word with him, forget it.

195
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,354
I wasn't suggesting anything.

196
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,878
Do you really expect me to believe
you chose this house by chance?

197
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,751
No, not by chance, no.

198
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,309
Nothing happens by chance.

199
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,118
I wanted to meet
your mother, that's true,

200
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,117
but I never planned to use her.

201
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,918
There's no need to apologize.

202
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,636
I like people who
go for what they want.

203
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,199
I wish I was more like you.

204
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,631
You're not missing much,
I assure you.

205
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,028
Oh, really?

206
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,509
You come here from another country,
all on your own,

207
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,910
and no sooner do you get here
than you make friends with a girl.

208
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,829
With two, I hope.
At least that's what I thought

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,355
- until a moment ago.
- It's not just that.

210
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,909
You're happy,

211
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,473
you only have to look at
your face to see that.

212
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,075
I try to be.

213
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,355
How do you do it?

214
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,555
It's easy.

215
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,914
It's a case of going
with the flow.

216
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,593
And what if it goes badly?

217
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,471
I'd rather make mistakes
than do nothing.

218
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,189
I'd rather mess up
than miss out completely.

219
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,189
It works for me.

220
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,114
You should try it.

221
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,875
Just a minute!

222
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,238
I thought you might
find this interesting.

223
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,118
Seldom is giving a lecture
on his latest book

224
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,032
at Merton College on the 24th!

225
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,679
There's your big chance!

226
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,194
There is no way
of finding a single

227
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,716
absolute truth, an irrefutable
argument that might help to answer

228
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,757
the questions of mankind.

229
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,758
Philosophy,
therefore, is dead.

230
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,238
Because "Whereof we cannot speak,

231
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,793
thereof we must be silent. "

232
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,517
Oh, it seems that
someone does wish to speak.

233
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,593
It appears you are not
in agreement with Wittgenstein.

234
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,869
That means either you have found
a contradiction in the arguments

235
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,715
of the Tractatus, or you have an
absolute truth to share with us all.

236
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,030
I believe in the number Pi.

237
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,794
I'm sorry,
I didn't understand you.

238
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,473
What was it
you said you believed in?

239
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,792
In the number Pi, in the Golden
Section, the Fibonacci Series.

240
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,428
The essence of nature
is mathematical.

241
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,671
There is a hidden meaning
beneath reality.

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,675
Things are organized following
a model, a scheme, a logical series.

243
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,834
Even the tiny snowflake

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,833
includes a numerical basis
in its structure. Therefore,

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,356
if we manage to discover
the secret meaning of numbers,

246
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,875
we will know
the secret meaning of reality.

247
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,715
Impressive!

248
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,313
Translating his words into

249
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,595
the Queen's English,

250
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,914
we find ourselves
faced with a fresh,

251
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,157
rousing defence of mathematics,
as if numbers

252
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,709
were pre-existing ideas in reality.

253
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,315
Anyway, this is nothing new.

254
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,633
Since man is incapable
of reconciling mind and matter,

255
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,951
he tends to confer
some sort of entity on ideas,

256
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,317
because he cannot bear the notion
that the purely abstract

257
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,948
only exists in our brain.

258
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,955
The beauty and harmony
of a snowflake.

259
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,595
How sweet!

260
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,875
The butterfly

261
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,519
that flutters its wings

262
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,558
and causes a hurricane
on the other side of the world.

263
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,554
We've been hearing about
that damn butterfly for decades,

264
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,679
but who has been able
to predict a single hurricane?

265
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,839
Nobody!

266
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,909
Tell me something...

267
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,395
Where is the beauty
and harmony in cancer?

268
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,037
What makes a cell

269
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,589
suddenly decide to turn itself
into a killer metastasis

270
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,116
and destroy the rest of
the cells in a healthy body?

271
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,068
Does anyone know?

272
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,875
No.

273
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,995
Because we'd rather think
of snowflakes

274
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,230
and butterflies than of pain,

275
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,188
war

276
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,392
or that book.

277
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,794
Why?

278
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,234
Because we need to think
that life has meaning,

279
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,433
that everything
is governed by logic

280
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,636
and not by mere chance.

281
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,196
If I write 2 then 4 then 6,
then we feel good, because we know

282
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,918
that next comes 8.

283
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,479
We can foresee it,

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,877
we are not in the hands

285
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,234
of destiny.

286
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,631
Unfortunately, however,

287
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,032
this has nothing to do with truth.

288
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,799
Don't you agree?

289
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,470
This...

290
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,439
is only fear.

291
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,754
Sad...

292
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,948
but there you go.

293
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,596
You must

294
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,398
be Martin.

295
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,358
At last we meet.

296
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,115
But, I don't get it,
are you leaving?

297
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,317
Yes, I'm leaving. It was a mistake.
It was all a big mistake.

298
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,389
Things have not turned out
as you expected, I guess.

299
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,949
No, they haven't.
You bet they haven't.

300
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,272
I hope the hastiness
of your decision

301
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,429
has nothing to do with

302
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,510
Professor Seldom.

303
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,438
News travels fast in Oxford.

304
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,398
We are a little village of gossips.

305
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,352
Anyway, I think you are wrong
about the great sage.

306
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,076
He was the best in his day, but...

307
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,152
now he just wants to sell books.
Like those assholes.

308
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,594
A real Seldom fan, eh?

309
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,871
I have a framed photo
of him in my room.

310
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,268
So he refused you too?

311
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,796
I would rather jump out of
a window than ask him for help.

312
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,997
I want nothing to do
with him or his books.

313
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,997
I prefer the Reader's Digest.

314
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,276
Taxi!

315
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,437
Hello.

316
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,438
Ah, we've got
the book you wanted!

317
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,635
There.

318
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,873
Fucking hell!

319
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,634
What are you doing here?

320
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,434
I live here.
What's your excuse?

321
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,791
I came to visit an old friend.

322
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,193
I'm sorry about before.

323
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,032
No, don't apologize.
I talked a lot of rubbish.

324
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,599
I tend to overact
when I have an audience.

325
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,558
The truth is I just wanted
to attract your attention.

326
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,394
You succeeded.

327
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,639
September the 24th,

328
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,360
1993. Inspector Petersen,
Oxford police station.

329
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,751
Investigating the murder
of Mrs. Julia Eagleton.

330
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,318
According to this report,
you and Professor Arthur Seldom

331
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,233
discovered the body...
at the same time.

332
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,310
Yes, we entered
the room together.

333
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,434
Are you one of
Professor Seldom's students?

334
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,955
No.

335
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,116
- Do you work for him?
- No.

336
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,510
Can you explain
why you were there together?

337
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,669
No.

338
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,158
To tell you the truth, I can't.

339
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,359
I was also surprised
to see him there.

340
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,835
So it was pure coincidence?

341
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,309
Everything seems to point
to that being the case.

342
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,798
And was this the first time
you'd seen Professor Seldom?

343
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,475
Not exactly. I was at
a conference he gave this morning.

344
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,073
I asked him a few questions.

345
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,709
What sort of questions?

346
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,269
Mathematical ones.

347
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,271
It's not by chance that I went

348
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,793
to Mrs. Eagleton's house
this afternoon.

349
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,630
I went there because
the murderer told me to.

350
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,313
The murderer warned you?

351
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,997
Yes, I received a note
during the conference.

352
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,673
What did it say?

353
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,308
Just one sentence:

354
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,433
"The first of the series,"

355
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,474
written in capital letters.
Underneath,

356
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,751
Mrs. Eagleton's address

357
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,474
and the time.

358
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,233
Can we see it?

359
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,070
No.

360
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,709
Why?

361
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,949
I threw it away.

362
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,476
You threw away
a vital piece of evidence?

363
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,875
Yes, well, let me explain.

364
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,552
After the conference,

365
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,632
I signed a number of copies.
When I'd finished, I set off home.

366
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,673
And that is when I realized
that the address on the note

367
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,159
was familiar

368
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,518
but honestly, I...

369
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,798
it just never occurred to me that
anything like this could happen.

370
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,750
Of course, when I got there,
it was too late.

371
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,274
We should call the police.

372
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,515
You're right.

373
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,109
Call them.

374
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,199
999.

375
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,315
Hello,

376
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,471
I'm calling to report a death.

377
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,078
3 Cunliffe Close.

378
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,109
It's an old woman.

379
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,275
Thank you.

380
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,154
What do you think happened?

381
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,715
I don't know.

382
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,669
We should wait outside.
We'd better not touch anything.

383
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,353
I shouldn't have
even used this phone.

384
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,717
Try to etch on your memory
everything you can see.

385
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,916
This moment is crucial.

386
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,231
She was playing Scrabble
when it happened.

387
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,595
Was she playing on her own?

388
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,753
Yes, she has both
the letter racks on her side.

389
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,753
You don't think she's been killed?

390
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,038
I can't see any other alternative.

391
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,070
Whoever did this obviously
intended to smother her

392
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,429
with the cushion
while she was sleeping.

393
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,238
She wakes up, puts up a struggle,

394
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,948
he presses down harder,
using both hands perhaps,

395
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,475
breaks her nose, hence the blood.

396
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,359
Or it could have been a woman,

397
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,875
using her knee
to add extra pressure.

398
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,195
When the killer removes
the cushion, sees the blood,

399
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,873
he drops it on the carpet
and doesn't even bother

400
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,598
to put anything back in its place.

401
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,113
Scared, probably.

402
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,470
In the book

403
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,712
that I based my conference on,
I unfortunately

404
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,516
compare logical series
with serial murders.

405
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,150
And since its publication
I've received

406
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,833
dozens of totally absurd letters,

407
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,592
which is why I attached
little importance to this one.

408
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,951
And you're sure you destroyed it?

409
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,718
Well, no, I threw it away
in the street.

410
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,869
Where?

411
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,478
Well, somewhere near
the Sheldonian Theatre.

412
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,393
Scott, get on to it,
it might still be there.

413
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,118
The road sweepers
will have passed through by now.

414
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,352
It doesn't matter. We'll search
the dustcarts, if necessary.

415
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,669
Now is there anything else? Anything
else that caught your attention?

416
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,354
Oh, uh, under the text

417
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,111
there was a hand-drawn circle,

418
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,873
a perfect circle,

419
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,912
also in black.

420
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,668
About...

421
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,032
this size,

422
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,035
approximately.

423
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,075
A circle?

424
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,035
Like a signature?

425
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,310
Oh no, I'm almost convinced
it was a symbol,

426
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,357
the first element
of a logical series.

427
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,397
Well, excuse my ignorance,

428
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,273
I must have been off school
the day they taught

429
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,589
logical series.

430
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,514
A logical series

431
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,238
is a group of elements
that succeed one another,

432
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,668
following a particular rule.

433
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,909
Could be 1, 2, 3, 4...

434
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,389
or even numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8...

435
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,634
Or of course it could be
the Fibonacci series.

436
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,479
Fibonacci?

437
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,039
A 12th-century mathematician.

438
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,512
Each element is the sum of the two
previous ones: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,

439
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,240
- 8, 13...
- Look, I still don't see

440
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,233
the relationship between
the murder and these series.

441
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,710
I'm sorry. In my book I sustain
the theory that the murder committed

442
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,912
for intellectual reasons
does not exist in the real world.

443
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,832
In general, the patterns
followed by a serial killer

444
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,390
are crude, monotonous
and repetitive,

445
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,711
cases that can be analyzed
psychologically, not logically.

446
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,395
So you think the murderer is
killing to prove something to you?

447
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,113
Yes, sadly, I believe
that to be the case.

448
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,039
Murderer wants to prove me wrong.

449
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,918
He wants to show that
he's more intelligent than I am

450
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,433
and that he can beat me

451
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,592
at my own game.
Somehow he knew of my friendship

452
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,116
with Mrs. Eagleton,
and decided to begin there.

453
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,714
How about this circle?
How do you explain this?

454
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,434
Oh, a circle's a good way
to start a logical series.

455
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,113
There's no symbol
more indeterminate.

456
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,799
Could mean almost anything.

457
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,748
So you mean there's gonna be
another murder after this one?

458
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,274
I'm afraid so.

459
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,998
And if we don't
discover it in time,

460
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,958
could be many more.

461
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,712
Okay, we are going to change

462
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,235
some notes please in part 12.

463
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,908
We knew she was going
to die at any time,

464
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,273
but never like this.

465
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,518
The doctors gave her 6 months
to live, 5 years ago.

466
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,952
Thanks to Beth's nursing
she had an extra lease of life,

467
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,839
like a blessing from heaven.

468
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,757
Maybe that's why
the murderer chose her.

469
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,074
How do you mean?

470
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,749
If he is trying to demonstrate
something purely intellectual,

471
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,229
maybe the deaths in themselves
don't interest him.

472
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,238
Maybe his aim is to inflict
as little harm as possible.

473
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,436
He chose someone
that should have died.

474
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,830
He probably knew Mrs. Eagleton
was receiving treatment...

475
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,195
She went every week
to St Joseph's hospital.

476
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,670
He could have found out about her
illness there, and that made her

477
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,558
the perfect victim for him.

478
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,915
Go on.

479
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,752
If he hadn't broken her nose,

480
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,990
it would have looked
like death by natural causes.

481
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,236
In that case, only you
would have known what happened.

482
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,992
The police would never
have been involved.

483
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,196
It would have been
a private challenge.

484
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,152
A murder that almost isn't a murder.

485
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,912
That makes sense.

486
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,633
What do you think
he would do next?

487
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,436
I suppose he'll try
to be more careful.

488
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,673
He'll commit another murder
that almost isn't a murder.

489
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,554
An imperceptible murder...

490
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,509
Excuse me.

491
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,788
Excuse me, officers,
but I need to speak

492
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,598
to Miss Eagleton first,
to break the bad news,

493
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,910
to her, if that's all right.
Thank you.

494
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,719
You have a C,

495
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,599
B flat, and C sharp.

496
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,478
Excuse me, please,
I can talk to him?

497
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,313
Yes, so

498
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,799
you have a C, B flat,

499
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,279
and C sharp.

500
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,673
Oh, no, no, no. You have a B,
a C sharp, and C natural...

501
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,749
Oh, okay,

502
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,878
let's do a break, please.

503
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,595
The police told me that you
were the one who found the body.

504
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,352
Forgive me, Beth.
I'm really sorry.

505
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,476
They asked me to try
and remember every detail and...

506
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,473
It's no problem.
I understand.

507
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,477
It must have been difficult
for you to go through all of this.

508
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,471
Two hours of interrogation.

509
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,473
It's logical, though, bearing
in mind I'm the chief suspect.

510
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,789
Did they tell you that?

511
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,520
No. No, they didn't have to.

512
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,074
You don't need to be
a detective to realize

513
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,992
that I'm the one who
most benefits from all this.

514
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,391
But you looked after her
for years. Seldom told me.

515
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,589
Five years...

516
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,709
Five years of waiting
for her to drop dead.

517
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,672
Forgive me for being
so cruelly sincere,

518
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,910
but if anyone wanted this
to end, it was me.

519
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,835
Do you know what it is
to wake up every morning

520
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,468
wondering when you're going
to have a life of your own?

521
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,429
I couldn't abandon her,
she was my mother.

522
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,477
She had cancer but it was supposed
to be a question of months.

523
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,799
You want this person you're supposed
to be looking after to disappear

524
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,075
and at the same time you know

525
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,639
there's something evil in you
for thinking that way.

526
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,749
You hate yourself

527
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,512
for the thoughts
that go through your head.

528
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,879
It's like being rotten inside.

529
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,508
Beth, you've no need to worry.

530
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,594
Seldom got a note.

531
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,069
Someone warned him of
what was going to happen,

532
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,595
- and is threatening to do it again.
- Who?

533
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,988
No one knows.

534
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,716
They made me go to the morgue
to look at the body.

535
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,678
Her eyes were still open.

536
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,114
Don't think about it.

537
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,115
I don't think I can sleep
upstairs tonight.

538
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,038
Is it okay
if I stay here with you?

539
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,068
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,958
Don't be... it's okay.

541
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,837
I don't know what you must
think of me. I'm so embarrassed.

542
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,832
Beth, please. Don't go.

543
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,391
Congratulations! Your name
in the papers and with Seldom!

544
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,358
Knock off the old lady
to attract attention, did you?

545
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,078
Not so fast!

546
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,633
Your friend is lucky.

547
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,033
Always close to death,
but never touched by it.

548
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,029
Didn't you know?

549
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,714
Thirty years ago,
the four of them

550
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,394
- were travelling together.
- What are you talking about?

551
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,950
Mrs. Eagleton's husband
and Seldom's wife were killed.

552
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,878
And guess who was driving.

553
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,549
And now the old lady is dead.

554
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,031
Three down, one to go.

555
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,958
This is Miss Scarlet

556
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,429
and she is in the dining room.
Now we know that the murder

557
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,476
took place in the dining room,

558
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,551
don't we? And that the victim
was killed with a cushion,

559
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,789
but since we don't have

560
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,110
a cushion, we'll use
the nasty little knife.

561
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,750
Now I'll stick

562
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,876
my neck out and say that
Miss Scarlet was the murderer

563
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,951
in the living room,
with the knife.

564
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,189
What do you think?

565
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,476
Clue didn't figure
into my degree course.

566
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,709
Cleudo!

567
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,393
It's recommended reading
in police academies.

568
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,994
In the papers,

569
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,354
Beth appears as the chief suspect.

570
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,873
But the police know all the facts.

571
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,794
Ah, I forgot that I was talking
to the champion of universal logic.

572
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,155
Thank you.

573
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,036
You and the police think that it's
possible to demonstrate the truth.

574
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,071
On the basis

575
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,196
of certain axioms
and by using valid reasoning,

576
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,834
you can reach a valid conclusion,
isn't that so?

577
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,150
As sure as today is Wednesday.

578
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,596
And what if I say,
"All Britons are liars"?

579
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,875
True, false
or impossible to prove?

580
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,868
All right. There are
mathematical formulations

581
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,679
that can neither be proved
nor refuted starting from axioms.

582
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,512
Indeterminable propositions.

583
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,319
Exactly, Gödel's
incompleteness theorem.

584
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,835
So, even in your world
of mathematical purity,

585
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,150
there are things
that can never be proven.

586
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,356
Yes, but that is not the case here.

587
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,514
There is a gap,

588
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,155
there is a gulf between
what is true and what is provable.

589
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,634
We can never be sure

590
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,518
of all the facts about a phenomenon,

591
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,638
and to lack just one, could change
everything. Even if we know

592
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,710
that the murder

593
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,632
took place in the dining room
with the knife,

594
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,798
and that Miss Scarlet was there
at the exact moment of the murder,

595
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,030
and that her fingerprints

596
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,474
were on the knife,
we can never

597
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,518
affirm with absolute certainty
that she committed the crime.

598
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,150
Oh, come on! It's
99% probable, for fuck's sake!

599
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,277
That's not absolute certainty,
that is an opinion.

600
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,078
We could have absolute certainty

601
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,355
if we trusted the word
of an eye-witness,

602
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,717
or we saw it with our own eyes.
I trust my own eyes.

603
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,514
No comment.

604
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,280
Things are here, under our noses.

605
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,795
These paving stones. They exist!

606
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,552
Or do you refute that
as well? You can't.

607
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,280
Are you sure? Heisenberg
wasn't quite as certain.

608
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,348
The physicist?

609
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,715
Yes, well, he tried to make
an atom bomb for the Nazis,

610
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,029
but he wasn't famous for that.

611
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,317
What is this? An exam? Heisenberg's
"uncertainty principle".

612
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,790
Bingo! Miss Scarlet
is now an electron, okay?

613
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,598
And you're looking at her
through a keyhole,

614
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,637
or a particle accelerator,
as you wish.

615
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,028
And every time you look at her,

616
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,670
Miss Scarlet will have
changed her appearance or...

617
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,150
her position.

618
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,152
Because the very fact
that you observe her

619
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,715
alters her atomic state.
How about that?

620
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,678
Don't try to confuse me with tricks.

621
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,479
Beth is not an electron,
and neither is Mrs. Eagleton.

622
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,835
So, do you really think
that criminal investigation

623
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,150
is more reliable
than physics or mathematics?

624
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,470
There are evident,
irrefutable facts.

625
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,239
For Christ's sake,

626
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,789
can you turn that bloody thing
off for a minute?

627
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,238
Unfortunately, the police
were unable to find the note.

628
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,278
Consequently, we have
no material evidence whatsoever.

629
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,112
Not a thing!

630
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,398
Imagine if that bloody psychopath

631
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,915
gets the wind up
and decides not to kill again...

632
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,874
Beth will be declared guilty.

633
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,635
I'd love to know
who it is you hate so much.

634
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,069
Myself.

635
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,953
I read the news in the papers.
You're not to blame for anything.

636
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,879
The worst thing is...

637
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,999
This is embarrassing...

638
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,109
Thanks to that
poor woman's death,

639
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,679
I've just had lunch
with Arthur Seldom.

640
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,150
Before, he didn't
even know I existed, but now...

641
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,998
I'm sorry about what

642
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,352
has happened but at the same time,
I swear I can't help feeling happy.

643
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,075
Never, in my life, have I
enjoyed myself so much.

644
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,909
One hour with Seldom is like
a lifetime with anybody else.

645
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,957
Well, you know,

646
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,838
there's nothing embarrassing
about sincere feelings.

647
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,228
Are you sure about that?

648
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,192
Spend an hour with me?

649
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,273
You have something to drink?

650
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,914
- No.
- Great.

651
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,151
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you okay?

652
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,269
What's wrong?

653
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,396
Nothing, it's... Sorry.

654
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,109
It's Seldom.

655
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,157
Just strange that you should
have read this book too.

656
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,153
- A nurse interested in mathematics.
- Well, not really.

657
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,919
It was the author who interested me.
He gave it to me.

658
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,551
- You know Seldom?
- Of course I do.

659
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,392
- See him almost every day.
- What?

660
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,756
He visits a friend
at the hospital,

661
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,479
a terminal patient.

662
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,311
One day we began to chat and...

663
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,515
And what?

664
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,992
And he gave me the book.

665
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,075
- That's all?
- You're jealous?

666
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,516
He could be your father... Your
grandfather, come to think of it.

667
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,669
Yeah.

668
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,436
I just like mystery novels,

669
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,756
he was here for a while,
we had a laugh,

670
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,195
I gave him a couple of my books
and he gave me his.

671
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,239
- Is that a crime?
- No... Of course not.

672
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,871
Can you get him out of your mind,

673
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,557
please?

674
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,710
I just don't understand why
you didn't tell me to begin with.

675
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,835
What do you want?

676
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,311
A list of all the people
who have passed through here?

677
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,792
- No.
- Good.

678
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,514
Everything you read
in the papers is a lie.

679
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,749
Did you know that?

680
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,079
No, uh...
I don't pay much attention.

681
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,196
- Have you read the Bible?
- Not all of it.

682
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,150
Jesus died on the cross
and then rose on the third day.

683
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,634
But in body and soul,

684
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,679
at least so they say.

685
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,748
He ate fish and spoke to Peter.

686
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,990
That's how he spent forty days.

687
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,554
Forty days!

688
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,758
He must have been green,
and have stunk to high heaven.

689
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,159
Hey, wait, wait.

690
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,639
Jesus was a terrorist.

691
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,879
All his life.

692
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,073
A revolutionary who kicked
money changers out of the temple.

693
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,952
Do you know why
he came back from the dead?

694
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,634
- No, theoretically...
- Jesus

695
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,758
came back to life to avenge
himself on his murderers.

696
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,909
Like in a horror movie.

697
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,436
Of course, that's not nice.
That's not interesting.

698
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,678
You can go in now,
your daughter

699
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,875
- is expecting you.
- All right.

700
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,913
What are you doing here?

701
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,197
I had the urge to see you,
that's all. Do you mind?

702
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,875
You're lying.

703
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,109
How do you know?

704
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,958
I didn't, I do now.

705
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,756
You're here to see
Seldom's friend, aren't you?

706
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,275
You should have seen the look
on your face when I mentioned him.

707
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,957
And how are you going to explain
what you're doing here?

708
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,992
I'll tell him I came to see you.

709
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,829
You swine.

710
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,037
Who is that guy?
He's nuts.

711
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,789
Well, you would be too
if your daughter needed a transplant

712
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,439
and you couldn't find a donor.

713
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,233
There were two people
that could have been compatible,

714
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,879
but their families refused.

715
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,349
Now I get it.

716
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,079
You know, he thought
of committing suicide

717
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,151
in order to give her his lungs.

718
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,833
That's ridiculous.

719
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,310
Giving your life for someone
you love is ridiculous?

720
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,275
His name is Kalman,

721
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,158
one of my most brilliant students.

722
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,469
He was quick in his conclusions,

723
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,789
clear in his exposition.

724
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,073
He designed intelligence tests.
I initiated him

725
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,510
into the study of logical series.

726
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,636
He was meticulous,
to the point of obsession.

727
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,313
He marked the tests himself,

728
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,754
one by one, and discovered

729
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,194
something really curious:

730
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,238
some of the tests were perfect;
the majority had a few mistakes.

731
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,834
But there was a third group.

732
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,911
The answers were absurd,
incomprehensible,

733
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,269
illogical, random,

734
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,317
the sort of thing
that a lunatic would write.

735
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,549
Kalman interviewed

736
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,199
the pupils of this third category.

737
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,557
The answers that
he had considered absurd

738
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,115
were, in fact,
another possible solution

739
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,110
and perfectly valid

740
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,315
to continue the series,

741
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,199
only with an infinitely
more complex justification.

742
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,511
The intelligence
of these pupils

743
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,274
went beyond
the conventional solution and was

744
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,793
much more far-reaching.

745
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,478
It was then that I had
to break the bad news to him.

746
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,552
Wittgenstein's paradox
concerning finite rules.

747
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,752
Kalman found in practice

748
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,672
what Wittgenstein
discovered decades before.

749
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,989
The series 2, 4, 8,

750
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,309
could obviously be followed

751
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,869
by 16, but also by 10

752
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,031
or 7004.

753
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,994
It's always possible
to find a rule,

754
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,752
a justification which allows

755
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,036
a series to be continued
by any number.

756
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,471
It all depends on
how complicated the rule is.

757
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,473
Suddenly, he realized
that he couldn't even trust

758
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,311
the two times table.

759
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,114
His whole life was being
sucked into a whirlpool

760
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,838
of meaningless numbers.

761
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,719
Normal thought seems to be
guided by certain grooves

762
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,711
etched into our brain

763
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,393
which impede
our leaving that track

764
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,198
and jumping it like the chosen few

765
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,635
who are able to think
without limitations.

766
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,155
Kalman decided
to take a strange path.

767
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,912
He began to try out his tests

768
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,799
in psychiatric hospitals,
on lobotomized patients.

769
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,518
There was a remarkable similarity

770
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,318
between those symbols

771
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,833
and the results of the tests

772
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,194
of the highly-gifted subjects.

773
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,750
He was in the presence
of pure thought,

774
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,399
without grooves,

775
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,036
but he couldn't understand it.
The problem

776
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,519
was his own brain.

777
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,275
He saw everything from the outside.
To understand

778
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,556
those symbols, he had
to see them from the inside.

779
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,396
There was only one way of
achieving it: to erase the grooves.

780
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,352
The idea might seem grotesque,

781
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,999
but not to a person
who has been told

782
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,151
that he's suffering
from terminal cancer.

783
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,759
His bones were rotting like wood

784
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,592
infested with woodworm.

785
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,631
All he had to look forward to

786
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,360
was the amputation
of his limbs, one by one.

787
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,590
He was euphoric, he laughed,
nervously, like someone about

788
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,712
to discover something incredible
who can't contain his joy.

789
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,710
It was then

790
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,195
that I realized that my friend
had gone completely mad.

791
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,913
He wanted to lobotomize himself.

792
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,957
His only problem
was how to ensure

793
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,236
that the brain damage
was not excessive.

794
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,672
He had to perforate
the skull and reach

795
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,239
the brain, with something like

796
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,469
a small harpoon.

797
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,476
He asked for my help
and I refused,

798
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,031
although I did promise I would try
to collect the messages he wrote

799
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,428
from the other side.

800
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,597
He used a nail gun.

801
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,479
What does he write?

802
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,951
The symbols are becoming
more and more illegible.

803
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,109
In all this time he's never drawn
a logical symbol or a number.

804
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,838
So what are they, then?

805
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,112
Four letters that
he repeats over and over.

806
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,629
A woman's name.

807
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,993
Where were you last night?

808
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,839
Beth, what are you doing here?

809
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,752
I was waiting for you.

810
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,079
I'm sorry. I was out and...

811
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,708
I thought you felt
something for me.

812
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,828
More than pity,

813
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,753
but I was wrong.

814
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,436
Of course I feel something
for you. We're friends.

815
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,828
I want to help you, but...

816
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,275
"We're friends,
you want to help me".

817
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,753
That's worse than saying
"you disgust me".

818
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,479
- Beth, please.
- Don't touch me!

819
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,359
The kinderyou try to be,

820
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,317
the more humiliated I feel.

821
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,752
Beth, I don't mean to humiliate you.

822
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,153
Then treat me like a woman. You all
treat me like I was a little girl.

823
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,395
Maybe this isn't the time for...

824
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,471
Now is the fucking
perfect time for this, Martin.

825
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,429
What's the matter?

826
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,790
You're embarrassed to be seen
with me? Is that it?

827
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,678
Don't worry.
I'm his mother.

828
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,871
I'm just making sure
he does his homework.

829
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,756
Be quiet!

830
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,628
Beth, wait!

831
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,874
Found your killeryet?

832
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,515
Lorna? It's me, Martin. Do you know
anything about Seldom's friend?

833
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,955
Kalman?
What's wrong?

834
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,997
He's been murdered.
Today, at two fifteen.

835
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,352
No... Wait a second.

836
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,398
Sorry, Sherlock,
but he's alive.

837
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,629
Are you sure?

838
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,313
Yes, he's right in front of me.

839
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,789
If it's not him, then who?

840
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,749
It would have looked like
death from natural causes,

841
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,195
if we hadn't discovered
this little detail.

842
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,798
It's an intravenous injection,

843
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,315
and he wasn't receiving
that kind of treatment.

844
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,674
What sort of poison
was administered?

845
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,229
We don't know. We'll have to wait
for the post mortem report.

846
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,719
We know the time of death?

847
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,438
Exactly as it said on the note:

848
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,119
quarter past two.
It says so

849
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,998
- on the wristband.
- Where did they find the body?

850
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,549
In the ward,
before it was brought here.

851
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,349
All of these people
have died in the last few hours?

852
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,069
Well, it's only to be expected.
This is the terminal illnesses ward.

853
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,078
At least a couple
of patients die every day,

854
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,719
according to
the senior nursing officer.

855
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,030
He knew my movements,
which encouraged him

856
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,076
to commit the crime here.

857
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,391
If he had meant to harm me,
he would have killed Kalman.

858
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,515
Or he could have seen you

859
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,716
enter the ward and didn't know
which of the two was your friend.

860
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,154
A terminal patient

861
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,435
on the point of death.

862
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,875
A murder that wouldn't have been
discovered had it not been

863
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,230
- for the note.
- Another imperceptible crime.

864
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,793
And might I know what
you're talking about, gentlemen?

865
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,154
The second sign gives the clue as to
how the sequence should be read.

866
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,197
It could be
figurative representations,

867
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,035
or could be semantic or syntactic,
like geometric figures.

868
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,156
Can you translate that?

869
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,319
The professor means the signs

870
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,118
could represent things
in the real world

871
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,990
or not represent anything,
be abstract, like geometric shapes.

872
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,431
The second symbol
is again astute, because,

873
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,556
being so schematic,
it allows both readings.

874
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,589
It could be a game of symmetry,
or it could simply be a fish.

875
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,955
Soup,

876
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,029
fish,

877
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,514
dessert.

878
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,112
Martin, show some respect

879
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,276
for the inspector, please.

880
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,749
No possibility deserves
to be overlooked.

881
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,998
Let me propose a puzzle.

882
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,430
What is the fourth

883
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,794
symbol...

884
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,279
in this other series?

885
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,189
No idea.

886
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,032
Did you miss class that day, too?

887
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,915
You just have to know how to look.
The solution

888
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,115
is very simple, I assure you.

889
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,918
It's called the idiot series.

890
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,390
Anyone who can't work it out...

891
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,073
Thank you, professor.
I get the message.

892
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,510
However, I incline to the idea that
the symbols relate to mathematics,

893
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,994
rather than gastronomy.

894
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,236
So, you think
a mathematician's involved?

895
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,029
It's possible, someone who seeks
recognition of some sort,

896
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,156
or someone who's not
a mathematician but wants to be.

897
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,309
A student?

898
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,390
That's unlikely.

899
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,675
Could you take

900
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,512
the second lieutenant out, Martin?

901
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,790
No, I haven't taught
for a long time.

902
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,916
Well, can you tell us

903
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,150
what the third symbol

904
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,150
will be?

905
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,309
No.

906
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,517
Far too many options.

907
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,555
He's putting us to the test,
and I wouldn't like to slip up.

908
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,478
Okay, let's see
if I've got this right.

909
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,473
We are going to wait
until he kills another person

910
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,837
because we can't decipher
this bloody puzzle?

911
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,272
Tricky situation, isn't it?

912
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,268
- Could I get those there?
- 2.50 please, sir.

913
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,029
Good evening.

914
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,915
Seldom!

915
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,109
Martin?

916
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,759
Why are you following me?

917
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,718
I'm not following anybody,
for God's sake, least of all you!

918
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,233
So what are you doing here?

919
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,674
I'm going to that restaurant.

920
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,478
Do you find it so odd that
I should be going out for dinner?

921
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,550
That's where I'm going, too.

922
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,152
Why, that's absurd.

923
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,349
I'm sorry.

924
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,589
I should have told you
Arthur was coming as well.

925
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,876
Excuse me, Lorna,
but I'm the one who's annoyed

926
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,071
by the presence at our table
of this good-for-nothing.

927
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,036
Good-for-nothing?

928
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,798
You couldn't see a joke if it stood
up and bit you in the arse, Martin.

929
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,870
You're far too serious

930
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,679
- for your age.
- He called me at the hospital and I

931
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,432
just thought it would be best to
bring you up to date together, so...

932
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,639
Forget it, I'm not bothered by it.
I just hope I didn't hurt you.

933
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,756
Even if you had,
I wouldn't admit it.

934
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,399
You're like two kids
fighting over a ball.

935
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,915
- And you're the ball?
- No, I'm the nurse who's gonna spank

936
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,075
your bottoms
if you don't shut up.

937
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,355
Please.

938
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,751
I talked with the forensic expert.

939
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,716
And?

940
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,756
Nothing.

941
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,230
Not a trace of
any toxic substance.

942
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,197
Whatever he was injected with
is totally unknown.

943
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,475
Air, maybe?

944
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,789
No!

945
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,075
Let her speak, please.

946
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,028
He's right, it's unlikely.
If he'd been injected with air,

947
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,276
they would have spotted it
in the post mortem.

948
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,838
However there is another
possibility. A substance

949
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,150
they extract from
a poisonous mushroom: Amanita

950
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,118
Muscaria. But there are
no reagents that detect it.

951
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,992
So it's a sort of secret among

952
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,952
- forensic pathologists.
- How did you find out?

953
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,834
Lorna has a knack
of finding out what she wants.

954
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,153
Her house is littered
with murder mysteries,

955
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,197
but I imagine
you know that by now.

956
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,395
Yes, I do.

957
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,830
What surprises me
is that you haven't managed

958
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,831
to worm all the information
out of Martin.

959
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,436
Martin is a good guy.
He knows he can't tell anyone

960
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,959
what you or the police
have told him in confidence.

961
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,917
Well, he does right
not to tell you anything.

962
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,911
After all, you're still
on the list of suspects.

963
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,830
Me?

964
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,592
Well, don't look so surprised.

965
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,512
Both murders are closely linked
with the hospital.

966
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,591
You could have gone
into the room and injected

967
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,829
that substance which, curiously,

968
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,070
only you and the forensic
pathologists know about.

969
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,276
That's ridiculous.
She has no motive.

970
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,792
Of all the vast mountains of
knowledge you have not yet scaled,

971
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,794
Martin, this slope is one
of the most slippery. Be careful.

972
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,831
Don't even go there, Arthur.

973
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,079
Let it suffice to say

974
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,639
that our relationship
transcended the purely intellectual,

975
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,351
and when it ended,

976
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,470
she took it anything but sportingly.

977
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,153
If you don't shut up
I'll kill you, I promise.

978
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,829
There, you see?

979
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,800
Has she or has she not got a motive?

980
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,470
You are so obnoxious.

981
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,150
You enjoy playing with people.

982
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,433
Now do you understand?

983
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,876
Any formulation
is valid in the series,

984
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,918
because we can always find
a rule that justifies it.

985
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,592
Heart on a line,
now you've got the eight...

986
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,792
now you give me the fourth.

987
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,714
Ah, well, well, young man.
You are certainly not a total idiot.

988
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,597
One, two, three, four.

989
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,671
- This was easy.
- The murderer's series

990
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,717
is infinitely more complex.

991
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,233
Tell me what the third symbol is.

992
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,791
Circle, fish...

993
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,074
What's the third?

994
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,713
I'm sorry, I can't say.

995
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,633
- Why not? Don't you trust me?
- I trust you

996
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,949
implicitly but
that's not the point.

997
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,878
If I tell you,
then you'll stop thinking.

998
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,317
You might come up
with a better idea

999
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,595
than mine.

1000
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,469
No, there's something else. You
could have easily told the police.

1001
00:55:58,729 --> 00:56:00,447
Forthem, anything
is better than nothing.

1002
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:02,243
You're right.

1003
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:05,401
But there's a good reason
why I didn't.

1004
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:06,843
I'm scared.

1005
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:07,725
Scared?

1006
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:10,807
This whole business terrifies me.

1007
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:13,085
We're playing
with symbols and puzzles,

1008
00:56:13,249 --> 00:56:14,648
but behind it all
is the real world,

1009
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:17,482
do you understand?
It's about people's lives.

1010
00:56:17,729 --> 00:56:21,199
If we make a mistake in an equation,
we rub it out, no problem.

1011
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,721
But where life is concerned,

1012
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:25,402
there's no turning back.

1013
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:27,762
In the real world any decision,

1014
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:30,887
however insignificant,
has irreversible consequences.

1015
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:33,563
At least, that's
what life has taught me.

1016
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,162
You're very young.

1017
00:56:39,249 --> 00:56:41,968
I've already paid
a high price for my mistakes.

1018
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:57,158
Keep this.

1019
00:56:58,409 --> 00:56:59,364
What is it?

1020
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:01,442
It's the third symbol of the series.

1021
00:57:01,689 --> 00:57:04,647
You can do one of two things: you
can open it now and have your answer

1022
00:57:04,809 --> 00:57:07,084
or you can work out
the solution yourself,

1023
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:09,524
and prove you're not an idiot.

1024
00:57:35,249 --> 00:57:36,398
Thank you very much.

1025
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:37,843
We're finished.

1026
00:57:38,009 --> 00:57:38,839
Thanks.

1027
00:57:42,249 --> 00:57:43,318
I'm glad to see you.

1028
00:57:43,689 --> 00:57:45,042
That was spectacular.

1029
00:57:45,249 --> 00:57:46,568
You should see it
with the fireworks

1030
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,082
- and everything...
- What, here?

1031
00:57:48,249 --> 00:57:50,160
No. It's just a rehearsal
forthe Guy Fawkes' day concert.

1032
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:51,844
Guy Fawkes?

1033
00:57:52,009 --> 00:57:53,362
Remember, remember
the fifth of November?

1034
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:55,201
No, sorry, I don't remember.

1035
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:56,319
And...

1036
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:58,161
it'll be my last concert.

1037
00:57:58,329 --> 00:57:59,603
I'm taking your advice
and getting out.

1038
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:01,646
This "marvellous" city
can be stifling.

1039
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:03,288
It's too dismal.

1040
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,326
I want to go somewhere
with more light.

1041
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,688
Spain or...
maybe South America.

1042
00:58:08,849 --> 00:58:11,238
Beth, I want to apologize
for what happened.

1043
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,844
It was my fault.
I needed help,

1044
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:17,284
a little affection, you gave it
to me and I spoiled it all.

1045
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:19,804
You were going through
a difficult time, I understand.

1046
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:23,649
You're very sweet.
So, you coming to the concert?

1047
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:24,964
I'll be there.

1048
00:58:33,609 --> 00:58:34,644
Martin!

1049
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:37,960
There's something else
I need to tell you.

1050
00:58:38,729 --> 00:58:41,687
I spoke with Petersen and maybe
I said more than I should have.

1051
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:42,998
Why?

1052
00:58:44,049 --> 00:58:46,802
He began to ask me
some questions about you.

1053
00:58:47,049 --> 00:58:48,118
Me?

1054
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:49,724
He wanted to know

1055
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:51,607
why you chose
my house in particular.

1056
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:53,117
What did you tell him?

1057
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:54,485
The truth.

1058
00:58:54,649 --> 00:58:56,765
That you're obsessed with everything
there is to do with Seldom.

1059
00:58:56,929 --> 00:58:57,884
You told him what?

1060
00:58:58,049 --> 00:58:59,402
I didn't think it was important.

1061
00:58:59,729 --> 00:59:02,197
I'm sure you're not going to deny
that you're obsessed with him.

1062
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:03,478
What are you talking about?

1063
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:06,448
He also asked me...

1064
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:10,766
if... there was any relationship
between the two of us.

1065
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:12,960
- And you said...
- I told him what happened.

1066
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:14,528
What happened?
Nothing!

1067
00:59:14,689 --> 00:59:16,725
Exactly, that's what
I told him, nothing happened.

1068
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,762
Okay, okay... You'd have been better
off not saying anything at all.

1069
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:22,442
I know, and...

1070
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:25,204
as soon as I said it
I regretted it but...

1071
00:59:25,689 --> 00:59:26,917
I was angry
with you and it was

1072
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:28,244
the first thing
that came into my mind.

1073
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:30,248
What else did you tell him, Beth?

1074
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:32,320
I told him that I...

1075
00:59:33,129 --> 00:59:36,041
I had a feeling that
you weren't interested in me

1076
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:38,681
and that you preferred
being with Seldom.

1077
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:39,964
Oh, bloody hell!

1078
00:59:40,129 --> 00:59:41,278
I'm sorry.

1079
00:59:44,009 --> 00:59:46,569
You don't think they'll take
something so stupid seriously?

1080
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:48,799
They take everything
seriously, Beth.

1081
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,239
Well, I don't think it's going
to put you on the spot.

1082
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:55,759
It's absurd that the police should
think that you're the murderer.

1083
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:00,564
Does the perfect crime exist?

1084
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:03,927
For years, writers
have speculated on this idea

1085
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:05,358
and murderers too.

1086
01:00:05,609 --> 01:00:08,123
Some even managed to put
the idea into practice.

1087
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:10,678
Like the case
of Howard Green, in London.

1088
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:12,601
Green was a humble tailor,

1089
01:00:13,529 --> 01:00:15,087
well-considered socially.

1090
01:00:15,249 --> 01:00:18,161
He kept a diary which
the police found in his own house.

1091
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:20,240
In the diary, he analyzed

1092
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:21,478
in great detail

1093
01:00:21,649 --> 01:00:23,082
four teen ways of murdering

1094
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:26,878
his wife, for whom he professed
a deep and secret

1095
01:00:27,049 --> 01:00:28,164
hatred. Some of

1096
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:29,842
the procedures were ridiculous,

1097
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:32,284
others brutal, one or two

1098
01:00:32,449 --> 01:00:33,643
really brilliant.

1099
01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:35,401
But what Green understood at once

1100
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:37,639
was that the main danger
for the criminal

1101
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:41,119
was not the possible investigation
of facts in the past

1102
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,483
but the problems that

1103
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:44,287
might arise in the future.

1104
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:48,079
Every alibi contains an element
of falsehood which with patience

1105
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:49,728
can be discovered.

1106
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:53,882
His conclusion was that
the only perfect crime that exists

1107
01:00:54,089 --> 01:00:57,525
is not the one that remains
unsolved but the one

1108
01:00:57,689 --> 01:01:00,123
which is solved
with the wrong culprit.

1109
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:02,362
Does he kill her in the end?

1110
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:05,119
No, she kills him.

1111
01:01:06,089 --> 01:01:08,478
One night she found the diary.

1112
01:01:08,849 --> 01:01:10,407
She ended up stabbing him with

1113
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:11,558
the kitchen scissors.

1114
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:15,363
The jury, horrified
by the reading of the diary,

1115
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:17,600
judge the murder to have been

1116
01:01:17,769 --> 01:01:19,805
in self-defence
and declare her innocent.

1117
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:21,798
Julia Green,

1118
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,324
you have been found
not guilty, you are free to go.

1119
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:28,684
I don't understand.
How is it the perfect crime?

1120
01:01:29,169 --> 01:01:30,363
It was discovered recently

1121
01:01:30,529 --> 01:01:33,123
that the handwriting in the diaries
was not Howard Green's.

1122
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:34,563
So, who wrote them?

1123
01:01:34,729 --> 01:01:37,960
His wife's lover,
a forger of works of art.

1124
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:41,243
The murderer is 30/35 years old.

1125
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:44,640
Born into a lower middle class
family, in a small town or a suburb

1126
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:45,878
of a big city.

1127
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:49,002
He's got the characteristics
of a precocious genius.

1128
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:50,888
And probably

1129
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:52,528
some form of physical defect.

1130
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:55,681
He imagines that his talents

1131
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:59,603
triumph and that he can destroy
those who humiliate him.

1132
01:01:59,769 --> 01:02:01,248
Then his big chance arrives:

1133
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:04,958
to leave his environment and put
his former world behind him.

1134
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:09,528
And it is here that something
unexpected happens: he is rejected.

1135
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:12,960
For some, probably
unfair reason, he is expelled

1136
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:16,361
from the place that he considers
to be his by right.

1137
01:02:16,529 --> 01:02:19,089
And he finds himself
faced with the prospect

1138
01:02:19,249 --> 01:02:21,319
of having to return to the world
that he thought he'd escaped.

1139
01:02:21,969 --> 01:02:25,200
Goodness, sounds like
this woman knew him personally.

1140
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:27,929
That's crazy, she has no basis.

1141
01:02:28,089 --> 01:02:30,205
In any case, we're not talking
about a psychopath,

1142
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:32,280
there are no elements of cruelty.

1143
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:35,322
In fact, we could say
that he is virtually innocent.

1144
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:39,607
Exactly. The psychologist
puts special emphasis on that.

1145
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:41,043
The murderer is seeking

1146
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:42,847
vengeance and admiration.

1147
01:02:43,049 --> 01:02:45,722
The murders are, in a sense,
a way of paying court to you.

1148
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:48,357
There's a mixture
of the desire for vengeance

1149
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:50,759
and the much stronger desire
to belong

1150
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:54,205
to your world. He wants you
to accept him, Seldom.

1151
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:55,639
He's trying to please you,

1152
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:58,767
as if he was in the first stages
of falling in love.

1153
01:02:58,929 --> 01:02:59,884
The psychologist

1154
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:03,406
thinks the murderer is a repressed
homosexual who lives alone.

1155
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:07,925
Bad cut.
You should have that seen to.

1156
01:03:08,129 --> 01:03:09,847
I don't know what the hell...

1157
01:03:10,049 --> 01:03:14,440
At least you didn't tip a pot of
boiling coffee over your trousers.

1158
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:16,600
I'm an expert
at that, believe me.

1159
01:03:17,409 --> 01:03:19,843
If you want,
we can carry on later.

1160
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:22,917
Yes, that might be an idea.

1161
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:26,117
Don't you think
you're exaggerating a bit?

1162
01:03:26,289 --> 01:03:28,678
The police are open
to all sorts of hypotheses.

1163
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:31,079
Right now any formulation
can be valid for them.

1164
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:32,364
You sound like Seldom.

1165
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:35,362
He's right, for God's sakes.
I could be a suspect, too!

1166
01:03:35,529 --> 01:03:36,848
Yeah, like me.

1167
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:38,921
Yes, like you, like everyone.

1168
01:03:41,969 --> 01:03:44,085
Don't let Seldom
get into your head, baby.

1169
01:03:44,769 --> 01:03:47,283
Cuz once he's in there,
there's no way of getting him out.

1170
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:51,078
That's what happened to you, isn't
it? You're still in love with him.

1171
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:52,918
That's not funny.

1172
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:55,884
Sorry.

1173
01:03:56,569 --> 01:03:59,129
It's as if Seldom was everywhere,
it's a nightmare.

1174
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:01,280
There's nothing I've done
that he hasn't done already,

1175
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:02,598
and apparently much better

1176
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:03,486
than me.

1177
01:04:03,649 --> 01:04:04,968
What do you want me to do?
To tell you

1178
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:06,687
I prefer you and you fuck
better than he did?

1179
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:09,727
No. I want you to lie
and tell me I'm more intelligent.

1180
01:04:13,009 --> 01:04:14,078
Go to hell.

1181
01:04:14,249 --> 01:04:15,602
You know what pissed me off?

1182
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:16,997
What pissed me off was knowing

1183
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:18,841
that I wasn't the only one
at the table who'd fucked you.

1184
01:04:21,409 --> 01:04:22,922
That was so long ago.

1185
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:25,640
When you were thirteen, right?
He calls you

1186
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:27,401
and you go running
like a little lapdog,

1187
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:29,685
and all so he can
give you another kick.

1188
01:04:30,609 --> 01:04:32,440
Yeah, that's how I am.

1189
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:34,438
Exactly like you.

1190
01:04:35,569 --> 01:04:37,525
Martin, I think
you'd better go now, really.

1191
01:04:38,009 --> 01:04:39,727
And until all this is over,

1192
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:42,928
I really don't want to know
anything about you or Seldom.

1193
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:46,925
You are a shit
like the rest of us.

1194
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:48,518
We are mediocre,

1195
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:50,806
and all mediocre people can do is...

1196
01:04:51,729 --> 01:04:53,003
get drunk and forget.

1197
01:04:54,609 --> 01:04:55,678
Leave me alone.

1198
01:05:04,089 --> 01:05:05,522
To the mediocre of this world!

1199
01:05:06,849 --> 01:05:08,885
To vulgarity

1200
01:05:09,089 --> 01:05:10,158
and stupidity!

1201
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:13,005
Cambridge has kicked us
in the arse again!

1202
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:15,684
What?

1203
01:05:16,769 --> 01:05:17,679
What are you looking at?

1204
01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:21,688
It's true, isn't it?

1205
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:24,478
You should give up maths
and write children's stories

1206
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:25,679
- instead!
- Calm down.

1207
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:27,761
- Let's get out of here.
- One day

1208
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:30,762
the Mad Hatter will come
out of his closet and assfuck

1209
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:32,885
- the lot of you!
- Okay, come on.

1210
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:38,363
What are you talking about?

1211
01:05:38,529 --> 01:05:40,485
What planet are you from,
bloody fool?

1212
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:42,287
If you'd stopped
fucking everyone in sight

1213
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:45,282
and paid a bit of attention,
you'd have realized.

1214
01:05:48,129 --> 01:05:50,040
Henry Wilkins?
Who's Henry Wilkins?

1215
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:52,524
He's Kennedy's assassin,
who do you think?

1216
01:05:53,169 --> 01:05:55,080
He's solved Bormat's Last Theorem?

1217
01:05:55,689 --> 01:05:58,249
At least that is the rumour.
He's giving

1218
01:05:58,409 --> 01:05:59,888
a demonstration
in the next three days,

1219
01:06:00,049 --> 01:06:01,960
in the theory of numbers
conference at Cambridge.

1220
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:04,001
He's solved
the most fucking difficult

1221
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,399
mathematics problem
of the last 300 years.

1222
01:06:06,569 --> 01:06:09,527
And you know who should be there,
giving this demonstration?

1223
01:06:10,129 --> 01:06:14,168
Me!
Yuri Ivanovich Podorov!

1224
01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:16,126
You have a demonstration
of Bormat's Last Theorem?

1225
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:17,728
No, of course I don't!

1226
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:21,160
But I would have it, if your friend
Seldom had not stolen it from me.

1227
01:06:21,329 --> 01:06:22,557
Ah, so that's it...

1228
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,482
It was me who deduced
that the Bormat conjecture

1229
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,117
could not be solved without
Taniyama's formulation.

1230
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:30,559
For every modular form,
there is an elliptic curve,

1231
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:32,924
and for every elliptic curve
there is a modular form.

1232
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:33,965
You're drunk.

1233
01:06:34,129 --> 01:06:36,882
Yes, I'm drunk!
But eight years ago I was not!

1234
01:06:38,049 --> 01:06:39,607
I went to Seldom,

1235
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:41,487
explained to him,
asked him to help me

1236
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:43,640
get into the theory
of numbers group at Cambridge,

1237
01:06:43,809 --> 01:06:46,801
and, do you know what
he said about my idea?

1238
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:48,563
"It's absurd. "

1239
01:06:49,329 --> 01:06:51,081
"It's absurd"!

1240
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:55,086
And now, thanks to this
little bit of absurdity,

1241
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:57,083
Henry Wilkins

1242
01:06:57,969 --> 01:06:59,641
will go down in history.

1243
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:01,927
Apparently, he's been working

1244
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:04,239
on Bormat in secret

1245
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:06,718
- for seven years.
- Why in secret?

1246
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,688
What do you mean why?

1247
01:07:08,849 --> 01:07:11,488
Because they stole it from me!
It was my idea!

1248
01:07:11,649 --> 01:07:13,765
But I tell you something:
they don't know how to do it.

1249
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,238
There's a mistake in their approach.
They don't know how to do it.

1250
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:17,728
But it hasn't been proved yet.

1251
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:20,088
Don't contradict me.

1252
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:22,680
You're on their side, aren't you?

1253
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:26,160
You are all against me!
You are trying to steal my ideas!

1254
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:27,887
You won't read my mind!

1255
01:07:28,049 --> 01:07:30,085
Help me! I'm being robbed!
Help me!

1256
01:07:30,249 --> 01:07:31,568
They're trying to kill me!

1257
01:07:31,809 --> 01:07:33,959
If you don't shut up,
I fucking will kill you!

1258
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:38,358
Easy, easy.

1259
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:40,678
Bastards!

1260
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:44,849
Fucking English and
their damned good manners.

1261
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:46,323
When they fuck you,

1262
01:07:47,529 --> 01:07:49,406
they really fuck you.

1263
01:08:24,089 --> 01:08:25,681
Welcome to the party.

1264
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:30,247
I gather nobody told you
about the dress code for this do?

1265
01:08:36,209 --> 01:08:38,803
Good old Guy Fawkes
was ahead of his time.

1266
01:08:38,969 --> 01:08:40,448
He tried to blow up Parliament

1267
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,799
with the king, the lords and
the whole bloody government inside.

1268
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:46,918
Since then, every November 5th,
we've had this civilized celebration

1269
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,205
where we burn his image,

1270
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:52,444
although nowadays
I'd be hard pushed to tell you

1271
01:08:52,609 --> 01:08:55,328
whether it's to commemorate
his failure or his brilliant idea.

1272
01:08:57,409 --> 01:08:59,161
Talking of conspirators...

1273
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:01,525
No, don't look now, be discreet.

1274
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,999
Sitting behind me,

1275
01:09:04,169 --> 01:09:06,319
a few rows back, is a tall black
gentleman. Do you remember him?

1276
01:09:10,369 --> 01:09:11,404
Yes.

1277
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:13,964
He's been following me for 3 days
now. He's one of Petersen's men.

1278
01:09:14,129 --> 01:09:15,278
Is Petersen here as well?

1279
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:16,279
Sitting to our right,

1280
01:09:16,449 --> 01:09:18,007
just there,
with his daughter.

1281
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:22,048
There's something
I need to speak to you about.

1282
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:23,045
It might be...

1283
01:09:42,849 --> 01:09:44,168
- Did you see him?
- Who?

1284
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:45,045
Podorov.

1285
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:46,768
He had something under his cape.

1286
01:10:12,009 --> 01:10:13,965
We're following a suspect
inside the palace.

1287
01:10:14,129 --> 01:10:17,087
I want all available men
inside here, now.

1288
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:21,879
Podorov!

1289
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:27,957
He's going up to the roof!

1290
01:10:28,129 --> 01:10:30,723
What are you doing here?
Who's with Seldom?

1291
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:09,403
- I only want...
- Shut up

1292
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:10,843
and stay on the ground.

1293
01:11:11,009 --> 01:11:12,886
What the hell's this?

1294
01:11:14,289 --> 01:11:15,358
Martin, you traitor.

1295
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:19,045
"Bastards".

1296
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:20,358
This guy's just a fucking

1297
01:11:20,529 --> 01:11:21,678
clown.

1298
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:24,443
Scott, what the hell are you
doing here? Get back on Seldom!

1299
01:11:24,689 --> 01:11:25,485
I'm on to it.

1300
01:12:04,609 --> 01:12:06,008
Let me through, please.
I'm a doctor.

1301
01:12:08,769 --> 01:12:09,599
You okay?

1302
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:15,324
This man is dead.

1303
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:23,645
Seems the cause
of death was asphyxia.

1304
01:12:23,809 --> 01:12:26,004
How could they have choked him,
up there, in front of everyone?

1305
01:12:26,169 --> 01:12:28,125
According to the doctor
who attended to him,

1306
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:29,881
it was a spontaneous
respiratory arrest.

1307
01:12:30,049 --> 01:12:31,562
I've just spoken to Beth.

1308
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:33,845
Apparently, the man's state
of health was somewhat delicate.

1309
01:12:34,009 --> 01:12:37,001
He was operated on a few years ago
for pulmonary emphysema.

1310
01:12:37,169 --> 01:12:39,399
By rights he should
have died some time ago.

1311
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:42,639
With that problem,
if your breathing is obstructed,

1312
01:12:42,849 --> 01:12:44,282
you'd be dead
in a matter of seconds.

1313
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:47,159
We have no evidence to indicate
that this was a murder.

1314
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:48,603
Yes, we do.

1315
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:56,442
The third symbol is a triangle!

1316
01:12:56,609 --> 01:12:57,519
Where did you find this?

1317
01:12:57,689 --> 01:13:01,284
It was found on the conductor's
music stand. The assassin

1318
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:03,599
tore the words
"the third in the series"

1319
01:13:03,769 --> 01:13:04,884
from the program notes.

1320
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:07,005
The circle, the fish,

1321
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:09,805
and the triangle.
Well, it makes sense.

1322
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,567
I've had enough of this.

1323
01:13:13,049 --> 01:13:15,404
I want you to tell me right now
exactly what you know.

1324
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:16,843
Otherwise, I'm gonna have

1325
01:13:17,089 --> 01:13:18,522
to consider you
to be an accomplice, because

1326
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:20,486
it's obvious that
you're withholding information.

1327
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:24,362
I only have a rudimentary idea
of what his reasoning might be.

1328
01:13:24,529 --> 01:13:25,484
So what is it,

1329
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:26,638
for Christ's sake?

1330
01:13:27,849 --> 01:13:30,079
Well, I think maybe this is

1331
01:13:30,969 --> 01:13:32,197
not the best time.

1332
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:33,603
I don't believe it.

1333
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:35,487
Fine, fine.
I'll get out here.

1334
01:13:36,569 --> 01:13:38,400
- Do you mind, Martin?
- No, don't worry about me.

1335
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:39,365
I could use a walk.

1336
01:13:39,769 --> 01:13:41,327
Just don't walk
too far, all right?

1337
01:13:47,609 --> 01:13:48,644
Bastards.

1338
01:13:50,449 --> 01:13:52,201
In Cambridge preparations
are being made

1339
01:13:52,409 --> 01:13:54,923
to celebrate one of the crowning
moments in its history.

1340
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:59,641
If the rumours are true, thanks to
Professor Henry Wilkins, Bormat's

1341
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:03,802
famous last theorem could cease to
be unsolvable in the next few hours.

1342
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:06,563
Hundreds of mathematicians
from all over the world

1343
01:14:06,729 --> 01:14:08,685
will meet today
in Cambridge to witness,

1344
01:14:08,849 --> 01:14:10,168
live, the public demonstration

1345
01:14:10,329 --> 01:14:11,967
that Professor Wilkins will give

1346
01:14:12,129 --> 01:14:14,927
in the university's
Number Theory Congress.

1347
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:16,442
For centuries mathematicians

1348
01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:18,839
have tried in vain
to answer that theorem.

1349
01:14:19,009 --> 01:14:20,886
Will the mystery be resolved?

1350
01:14:24,769 --> 01:14:28,478
I'm sorry about yesterday,
but I still think that you should...

1351
01:14:28,649 --> 01:14:31,038
Yeah, that I should think
for myself.

1352
01:14:31,809 --> 01:14:33,765
Though I haven't been
too successful so far.

1353
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:38,279
Tomorrow the paper will publish
an article about the murders.

1354
01:14:38,449 --> 01:14:39,962
In it I explain everything I know.

1355
01:14:40,729 --> 01:14:41,684
Everything?

1356
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,799
The police think that
if we make it public

1357
01:14:44,969 --> 01:14:47,722
and we give our solution to the 4th
symbol, it'll stop the murderer.

1358
01:14:48,129 --> 01:14:49,767
What interests him is that

1359
01:14:49,929 --> 01:14:52,204
I recognize his intelligence.
That should be enough.

1360
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:54,043
Do you think it will work?

1361
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:56,360
It's the best
I could come up with.

1362
01:14:57,089 --> 01:14:59,523
So I have 12 hours
to prove I'm not an idiot.

1363
01:14:59,689 --> 01:15:01,202
That just about sums it up, right?

1364
01:15:01,849 --> 01:15:04,443
You're not an idiot,
much as you might try.

1365
01:15:05,129 --> 01:15:07,199
You know it, Martin,
you just have to remember.

1366
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,087
After all, you belong to the sect.

1367
01:15:17,849 --> 01:15:20,283
- I know what you're thinking.
- So?

1368
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,565
It could be the biggest mistake
of your life, believe me.

1369
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:23,798
I don't believe you.

1370
01:15:23,969 --> 01:15:25,004
I think you're lying.

1371
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:27,763
You're right.
I am lying,

1372
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:31,201
but if I distract you long enough,
maybe the bus'll set off and it'll

1373
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:32,484
be too late.

1374
01:17:12,209 --> 01:17:14,165
You know, these are a bit
hard to swallow at first,

1375
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:17,207
but after a while
you get a taste for them.

1376
01:17:17,369 --> 01:17:19,360
My spaghetti
or my mystery novels?

1377
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:21,167
No, spaghetti
is a great invention.

1378
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:23,047
So are mystery novels.

1379
01:17:23,209 --> 01:17:24,437
You know, they make sense.

1380
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:27,888
There's something to find out and
they explain it to you at the end.

1381
01:17:28,049 --> 01:17:29,607
In life, nobody
bothers explaining anything.

1382
01:17:29,769 --> 01:17:32,647
I don't want to speak
of explanations,

1383
01:17:32,809 --> 01:17:34,686
or conjectures, or anything else.

1384
01:17:34,849 --> 01:17:37,443
Outside this room nothing exists.

1385
01:17:38,169 --> 01:17:40,364
Only you, me

1386
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:42,717
and this spaghetti.

1387
01:17:45,649 --> 01:17:47,879
I know what it meant
for you to get off that bus.

1388
01:17:48,529 --> 01:17:50,247
It was worth it.

1389
01:17:50,529 --> 01:17:52,042
It's only just begun.

1390
01:17:54,649 --> 01:17:56,526
Look what you've done.
You're mad.

1391
01:17:56,729 --> 01:17:57,844
Mad about you.

1392
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:12,247
You've got some there.

1393
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:15,722
This moment is perfect...

1394
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:17,644
unique.

1395
01:18:18,169 --> 01:18:20,478
"The unshaken heart
of well-rounded truth".

1396
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:22,239
Come again?

1397
01:18:24,649 --> 01:18:28,005
It's from Parmenides,
he was a Greek stand-up comedian.

1398
01:18:28,289 --> 01:18:30,723
He said that reality
is one big lie,

1399
01:18:31,369 --> 01:18:32,643
and the only thing that exists

1400
01:18:32,809 --> 01:18:35,118
is a single unchanging God.

1401
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:38,081
Wow, you're doing it again.

1402
01:18:38,249 --> 01:18:39,125
What?

1403
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:40,802
Talking like
the people from your sect.

1404
01:18:40,969 --> 01:18:43,358
- Well, I guess we can't help it.
- I guess.

1405
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:45,883
Now I understand

1406
01:18:46,049 --> 01:18:49,564
why girls go out with musicians
and not mathematicians.

1407
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:50,878
That's what he said.

1408
01:18:51,049 --> 01:18:53,768
Really? He knew
girls prefer musicians?

1409
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,841
No, no, no, no.
The thing about the sect.

1410
01:18:57,049 --> 01:18:59,040
"You should know.
You're part of the sect. "

1411
01:18:59,689 --> 01:19:01,327
- What?
- Fuck.

1412
01:19:01,809 --> 01:19:03,527
No, no, no.
It can't be, it's too easy.

1413
01:19:03,689 --> 01:19:04,519
What's wrong?

1414
01:19:04,969 --> 01:19:06,925
I have to discover it before
it comes out in the papers.

1415
01:19:07,089 --> 01:19:08,158
What?

1416
01:19:09,129 --> 01:19:09,925
Oh my God, it's Seldom.

1417
01:19:10,089 --> 01:19:11,647
You just have to go along
with his bloody game, don't you?

1418
01:19:11,809 --> 01:19:13,640
Yes, I do! It's all
I can fucking think about.

1419
01:19:13,809 --> 01:19:15,527
- Beth was right.
- What?

1420
01:19:15,689 --> 01:19:17,600
You're in love with
a bloody lunatic. That old man

1421
01:19:17,769 --> 01:19:19,760
- turns you on more than I do!
- Look, Lorna, listen to me.

1422
01:19:19,929 --> 01:19:21,885
Just this once, that's all I ask.

1423
01:19:22,169 --> 01:19:23,966
When this nightmare's over,
we're getting out

1424
01:19:24,129 --> 01:19:25,881
- of here.
- Where to?

1425
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:28,359
Wherever. Outside these walls,
to a place with no books,

1426
01:19:28,529 --> 01:19:30,008
where people don't know
their two times tables.

1427
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,725
- Shit!
- I told you.

1428
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,725
It's too early,
even for the bookworms.

1429
01:19:43,489 --> 01:19:44,717
What now?

1430
01:19:45,169 --> 01:19:46,443
Bookstore!

1431
01:19:52,929 --> 01:19:54,965
- Hey, we're closed.
- We'll just be a moment!

1432
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:01,167
At least tell me
what we're looking for.

1433
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:04,368
Ah, here it is.

1434
01:20:05,169 --> 01:20:06,648
The sect of the Pythagoreans...

1435
01:20:06,809 --> 01:20:08,083
The fathers of mathematics.

1436
01:20:08,329 --> 01:20:10,160
They were forbidden
to reveal their secrets.

1437
01:20:10,369 --> 01:20:12,803
They functioned like
a religious sect, numbers

1438
01:20:12,969 --> 01:20:14,766
were sacred to them,
gods that conformed the world.

1439
01:20:16,049 --> 01:20:17,277
No, it's not here.

1440
01:20:19,609 --> 01:20:21,008
I'm sorry but you'll have
to come back later.

1441
01:20:21,169 --> 01:20:21,999
There's no one on the cash register.

1442
01:20:22,169 --> 01:20:23,887
Don't worry.
We don't need to buy anything.

1443
01:20:24,049 --> 01:20:25,277
Well, I think
you'd better leave, then.

1444
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:28,128
Oh, give us a moment.
Pretty please? Please.

1445
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:29,683
If you consult our catalogue,

1446
01:20:29,849 --> 01:20:31,407
I think you'll find everything
to meet your requirements.

1447
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:34,565
Will you shut up for a minute!
I can't think!

1448
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:35,806
I'm sorry,

1449
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:37,960
but you give me no option
but to call security.

1450
01:20:38,129 --> 01:20:39,357
Fine, call security.

1451
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:40,445
Just leave.

1452
01:20:43,769 --> 01:20:45,885
It's got to be mentioned
in one of these,

1453
01:20:46,369 --> 01:20:47,597
a diagram, or something.

1454
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:55,884
Kind of like that?

1455
01:20:56,409 --> 01:20:57,888
That's it. Perfect.

1456
01:20:58,409 --> 01:20:59,239
One,

1457
01:20:59,409 --> 01:21:02,321
the beginning of all things.
Perfection, enclosed in itself.

1458
01:21:02,489 --> 01:21:03,126
The fish.

1459
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:06,082
That's what we thought. The Vesica
Piscis, a Christian symbol, but

1460
01:21:06,249 --> 01:21:06,999
this one's much earlier.

1461
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:10,685
It's simply two, the intersection
of two circles. Symbol of opposites,

1462
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:13,204
duality, the war
between good and evil.

1463
01:21:13,529 --> 01:21:14,484
Three, the triad,

1464
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:17,038
the synthesis of opposites.
Peace after war.

1465
01:21:18,529 --> 01:21:19,644
And the fourth symbol?

1466
01:21:20,169 --> 01:21:22,967
The Tetraktys, the quaternary.

1467
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:26,041
One plus two, plus three,
plus four: ten.

1468
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:27,768
Totality, the Demiurge.

1469
01:21:28,089 --> 01:21:30,319
It was their divine number.

1470
01:21:33,089 --> 01:21:35,398
One, two, three, four.

1471
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:37,003
That simple.

1472
01:21:37,449 --> 01:21:38,882
How could I not see it?

1473
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:42,679
Any enigma is easy
once you know the answer.

1474
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:45,164
What are you looking for?

1475
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:49,208
The only thing I know about these
guys is that they had a unique...

1476
01:21:49,609 --> 01:21:52,521
understanding of medicine.
You know, if...

1477
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:54,760
intelligence was
the supreme value,

1478
01:21:54,929 --> 01:21:58,524
then the mentally retarded
were the greatest sinners.

1479
01:21:58,689 --> 01:22:00,884
They used them as guinea pigs

1480
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,164
for medical experiments.

1481
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:06,639
They even tried organ transplants...

1482
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:32,723
Oh shit.

1483
01:22:48,929 --> 01:22:51,443
Thanks very much,
that's all I need!

1484
01:22:52,649 --> 01:22:53,968
- Thank you.
- Really sorry.

1485
01:22:54,129 --> 01:22:55,164
Come on!

1486
01:22:56,409 --> 01:22:57,080
Hey!

1487
01:22:57,609 --> 01:22:58,280
Come here!

1488
01:22:58,929 --> 01:23:00,044
Come back here!

1489
01:23:00,649 --> 01:23:01,365
You two!

1490
01:23:01,529 --> 01:23:03,485
Where do you think
you're going? Come here!

1491
01:23:04,969 --> 01:23:06,084
I know who the murderer is.

1492
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:08,638
It's okay, John.
Really?

1493
01:23:08,849 --> 01:23:10,328
Look, I know I fucked up
in the concert,

1494
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:11,478
but now you have to believe me.

1495
01:23:11,649 --> 01:23:14,209
This time it could be worse, he
could kill more people, probably 10.

1496
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:15,199
Relax.

1497
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:19,163
This time he got in touch with us
directly. We guessed the symbol.

1498
01:23:20,049 --> 01:23:20,720
The tetraktys...

1499
01:23:20,889 --> 01:23:23,278
Exactly. The message
indicates a particular place.

1500
01:23:23,449 --> 01:23:24,598
He told us to send ambulances there.

1501
01:23:24,769 --> 01:23:25,406
A road?

1502
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:27,685
The A421. Just past
the Black Cat roundabout.

1503
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:29,282
That's the road to Cambridge.

1504
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:31,398
There's a flyover
on the main road.

1505
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:33,241
Petersen's already on his way.

1506
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,525
He'll try to stop the bus
before it reaches that spot.

1507
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:42,168
Have you located the bus yet?

1508
01:23:42,329 --> 01:23:43,921
It's three miles from where

1509
01:23:44,089 --> 01:23:45,602
you are, sir.
You'll be meeting up

1510
01:23:45,769 --> 01:23:46,838
in under a minute.

1511
01:23:48,769 --> 01:23:49,963
Petersen here, to all units.

1512
01:23:50,129 --> 01:23:52,199
The murderer may be travelling

1513
01:23:52,369 --> 01:23:55,406
with them, so keep your heads
down until I give the word.

1514
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:20,361
Where are they?
I can't see them.

1515
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:23,847
- Right in front of you, sir.
- Got it!

1516
01:24:24,849 --> 01:24:25,599
Now!

1517
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,519
Now!

1518
01:24:35,249 --> 01:24:36,284
Jesus!

1519
01:24:51,649 --> 01:24:54,163
Turn off the engine!
Put your hands on the wheel!

1520
01:24:56,769 --> 01:24:57,679
We made it in time.

1521
01:24:58,369 --> 01:24:59,643
They've stopped the bus.

1522
01:24:59,809 --> 01:25:01,322
Seldom and the other
mathematicians are safe.

1523
01:25:01,489 --> 01:25:04,606
Seldom? What have you done?
You've got the wrong bus!

1524
01:25:29,329 --> 01:25:30,159
Hello?

1525
01:25:30,329 --> 01:25:33,241
Seldom, you have to speak with
Petersen, there's another bus!

1526
01:25:33,409 --> 01:25:34,444
What are you talking about?

1527
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:35,883
It's the girl's father!

1528
01:25:36,049 --> 01:25:37,198
What girl?

1529
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:45,478
Martin?

1530
01:25:46,289 --> 01:25:47,483
Martin, can you hear me?

1531
01:25:47,649 --> 01:25:50,402
The girl in the hospital,
she needs a transplant.

1532
01:25:50,569 --> 01:25:52,878
He wants to kill
the kids to save her!

1533
01:26:08,529 --> 01:26:09,484
Sir?

1534
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:12,288
Excuse me, sir.
Sir, this way, please.

1535
01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:14,760
- That bus has to be stopped!
- Calm down, sir.

1536
01:26:14,929 --> 01:26:16,442
They're going to be killed!
I have to talk to Petersen!

1537
01:26:17,769 --> 01:26:20,488
Sir, one of the professors
insists on speaking to you.

1538
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:22,048
He's completely
lost control of himself.

1539
01:26:39,009 --> 01:26:40,647
Oh what the hell...?

1540
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:58,046
You.
Did you know about this?

1541
01:26:58,569 --> 01:27:01,037
Did you fucking know about this?

1542
01:27:01,209 --> 01:27:02,722
You and your fucking equations!

1543
01:27:13,969 --> 01:27:15,402
I don't know anything.

1544
01:27:21,129 --> 01:27:22,244
Nothing.

1545
01:28:10,049 --> 01:28:13,041
Five of the victims
are possible donors.

1546
01:28:14,249 --> 01:28:16,444
Five organs offer a fair chance.

1547
01:28:16,889 --> 01:28:18,117
They're rushing them off
to St Joseph's.

1548
01:28:18,529 --> 01:28:20,008
That's why he sent the ambulances.

1549
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:21,602
That's right.

1550
01:28:22,769 --> 01:28:24,487
The petrol tank
was down to a minimum.

1551
01:28:24,689 --> 01:28:26,168
He wanted to cause
as little harm as possible,

1552
01:28:26,329 --> 01:28:29,127
only this time
it wasn't exactly imperceptible.

1553
01:28:30,169 --> 01:28:31,807
Why all these?
Why all the symbols?

1554
01:28:32,209 --> 01:28:34,279
He didn't plan
to die in the accident.

1555
01:28:34,449 --> 01:28:37,361
His idea was to jump in time
to avoid being a suspect.

1556
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:38,245
How do you know?

1557
01:28:39,769 --> 01:28:42,522
When the bus crashed,
the doors were already open.

1558
01:28:43,809 --> 01:28:45,242
And what about the other deaths?

1559
01:28:45,889 --> 01:28:47,686
Well, if only the children
had been killed,

1560
01:28:47,849 --> 01:28:49,407
he would have been
the prime suspect.

1561
01:28:49,569 --> 01:28:51,287
Making us believe
in a serial killer

1562
01:28:51,449 --> 01:28:52,802
took the spotlight off him.

1563
01:28:52,969 --> 01:28:55,847
Only he miscalculated
and didn't get out in time.

1564
01:28:56,689 --> 01:28:59,157
So, he didn't really want
to kill the other people,

1565
01:28:59,529 --> 01:29:02,168
- he just needed an alibi?
- Exactly.

1566
01:29:03,009 --> 01:29:05,477
Shame we didn't work it out sooner.

1567
01:29:05,849 --> 01:29:06,838
So much

1568
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:08,078
for logic.

1569
01:29:53,529 --> 01:29:55,804
You were just a pawn in his game.

1570
01:29:57,009 --> 01:29:59,125
You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

1571
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:10,598
You don't know what you're saying.

1572
01:30:31,689 --> 01:30:33,566
You don't need to get on a plane.

1573
01:30:34,569 --> 01:30:35,604
Sorry?

1574
01:30:35,769 --> 01:30:39,045
I said, you don't need to get on
a plane. You're already miles away.

1575
01:30:39,649 --> 01:30:40,718
I was just thinking...

1576
01:30:40,889 --> 01:30:41,799
Really?

1577
01:30:46,169 --> 01:30:47,921
Ok.
From now on,

1578
01:30:48,089 --> 01:30:49,761
we are just two tourists

1579
01:30:49,929 --> 01:30:53,080
in an airport with the heaviest
rucksack I've ever seen.

1580
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,002
What did you pack in here anyway?

1581
01:30:56,209 --> 01:30:58,882
Oh, you know, just the essentials.
A double bed, a cooker,

1582
01:30:59,049 --> 01:31:00,402
for making spaghetti

1583
01:31:00,569 --> 01:31:02,161
- and a couple of other things.
- Well, I hope

1584
01:31:02,329 --> 01:31:03,921
you didn't pack a single
one of your mystery novels.

1585
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:04,760
Of course not!

1586
01:31:04,929 --> 01:31:07,682
No mystery novels,
no symbols, no Oxford.

1587
01:31:07,849 --> 01:31:09,487
We had a deal, remember?

1588
01:31:09,769 --> 01:31:11,202
You gonna be able to live like this?

1589
01:31:12,209 --> 01:31:13,278
Yes.

1590
01:31:13,449 --> 01:31:14,484
Just you and me.

1591
01:31:19,889 --> 01:31:20,799
Come on.

1592
01:31:29,289 --> 01:31:30,358
Thank you.

1593
01:31:39,049 --> 01:31:40,687
Can I have your
boarding pass, please?

1594
01:31:40,929 --> 01:31:42,078
He didn't know!

1595
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:43,285
Martin?

1596
01:31:44,649 --> 01:31:45,638
That old fucker tricked me!

1597
01:31:47,249 --> 01:31:48,284
He didn't know
what the third symbol was!

1598
01:31:57,489 --> 01:31:58,558
My God!

1599
01:31:59,209 --> 01:32:00,801
You've got the pictures with you?

1600
01:32:02,169 --> 01:32:03,488
What is this?

1601
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:05,685
"Kreis".

1602
01:32:09,049 --> 01:32:10,368
What is that?

1603
01:32:19,569 --> 01:32:22,447
She spent 3 years
deciphering German codes.

1604
01:32:22,609 --> 01:32:23,519
Excuse me, sir,
you can't do that here.

1605
01:32:23,689 --> 01:32:24,644
Of course!

1606
01:32:24,809 --> 01:32:26,959
Kreis is German for circle.

1607
01:32:27,369 --> 01:32:28,802
He came up with it on the spot!

1608
01:33:06,529 --> 01:33:07,848
Have you been here before?

1609
01:33:09,889 --> 01:33:11,322
I never had a chance.

1610
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:16,360
It would be a pity to leave the
country without seeing this place.

1611
01:33:18,129 --> 01:33:19,244
This is the largest

1612
01:33:19,409 --> 01:33:21,559
collection of fakes in the world.

1613
01:33:21,809 --> 01:33:23,447
Not even Michelangelo

1614
01:33:23,609 --> 01:33:25,839
can distinguish
this David from his original.

1615
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:30,520
Trajan's column
we believe to be in Rome,

1616
01:33:31,489 --> 01:33:35,801
but we are sure
that this is a common

1617
01:33:36,009 --> 01:33:37,965
plaster copy.

1618
01:33:39,049 --> 01:33:40,607
I feel at ease here.

1619
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:43,245
No one tries to deceive me.

1620
01:33:43,849 --> 01:33:45,646
In effect, Martin,
this is the place

1621
01:33:45,809 --> 01:33:48,687
that contains the most truth
in the entire planet.

1622
01:33:49,849 --> 01:33:52,886
We have an absolute truth:

1623
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:56,239
everything is fake.

1624
01:33:57,449 --> 01:33:59,201
Outside of these walls

1625
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:01,325
nobody is sure of anything.

1626
01:34:04,169 --> 01:34:07,525
You took a big risk in giving me
a blank piece of paper.

1627
01:34:11,009 --> 01:34:14,206
That was important.
I had to convince you that I knew

1628
01:34:14,369 --> 01:34:17,167
what the sign was when, at
that moment, I wasn't at all sure.

1629
01:34:17,689 --> 01:34:19,645
I knew you wouldn't
let me down, Martin.

1630
01:34:19,809 --> 01:34:22,243
Your pride wouldn't let you open
this piece of paper

1631
01:34:22,409 --> 01:34:23,637
until you had
a solution of your own,

1632
01:34:23,809 --> 01:34:27,484
and that, if I might say,
was going to take some time.

1633
01:34:28,129 --> 01:34:29,847
There was no serial killer.

1634
01:34:30,529 --> 01:34:33,168
It was an invention,
just like Petersen said.

1635
01:34:33,649 --> 01:34:35,799
But it wasn't
the bus driver's invention.

1636
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:37,118
It was yours.

1637
01:34:37,769 --> 01:34:40,886
You invented a series of killings
to hide the only real crime:

1638
01:34:41,449 --> 01:34:44,122
the death of Mrs. Eagleton.
Beth killed her,

1639
01:34:44,289 --> 01:34:46,564
just as the police had suspected
from the very beginning.

1640
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:53,805
Beth hated her life.
She couldn't put up

1641
01:34:53,969 --> 01:34:55,766
with that woman any more
so she killed her.

1642
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:57,840
That's when she sent you a note

1643
01:34:58,169 --> 01:34:59,488
asking for help.

1644
01:34:59,769 --> 01:35:01,646
I couldn't look her in the face.

1645
01:35:03,169 --> 01:35:05,319
It was my fault that her father
was killed in that accident

1646
01:35:05,489 --> 01:35:07,525
30 years ago.

1647
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:10,127
I couldn't let her down again.

1648
01:35:10,289 --> 01:35:11,927
We both met at the door.

1649
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:13,728
You'd come to get rid
of the evidence,

1650
01:35:13,889 --> 01:35:16,608
but I was there, in the way,
and that spoiled everything.

1651
01:35:17,889 --> 01:35:19,561
You had to come up with
a new plan, in front of me,

1652
01:35:19,729 --> 01:35:22,766
just moments before the police
arrived. You read the word

1653
01:35:22,929 --> 01:35:24,487
"circle" in German
on the Scrabble rack,

1654
01:35:24,649 --> 01:35:25,638
and that gave you the idea.

1655
01:35:27,169 --> 01:35:28,568
A series with
infinite possibilities.

1656
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:30,367
But you needed a second death

1657
01:35:30,529 --> 01:35:32,804
to convince the police
that the murderer was not Beth.

1658
01:35:32,969 --> 01:35:34,766
And unwittingly, I helped you.

1659
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:39,846
I gave you the idea of how
to do it, without even realising.

1660
01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:41,363
An imperceptible murder.

1661
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:42,923
A murderer who only kills

1662
01:35:43,089 --> 01:35:43,999
someone who is at

1663
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:45,358
death's door. You only had

1664
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:47,884
to wait for the occasion
and prick the body with a syringe.

1665
01:35:48,329 --> 01:35:50,923
That's when you sent
the second message. The fish.

1666
01:35:51,689 --> 01:35:54,078
You still didn't know
where all this was going to lead.

1667
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:57,161
The possibilities of continuing
the series were still infinite.

1668
01:35:57,329 --> 01:35:59,399
You had to wait for
another occasion to arise.

1669
01:35:59,569 --> 01:36:01,560
And that could take weeks, months.

1670
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:02,923
There was no hurry.

1671
01:36:03,249 --> 01:36:05,763
You probably had a different plan
for the third death,

1672
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:08,961
but that triangle player suddenly
appeared like a gift from the gods,

1673
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:12,722
- and you had your solution.
- At first I rejected it.

1674
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:14,083
Too many people, too operatic.

1675
01:36:15,289 --> 01:36:15,960
Don't lie.

1676
01:36:16,129 --> 01:36:17,039
You couldn't waste

1677
01:36:17,249 --> 01:36:18,398
a chance like that.

1678
01:36:18,809 --> 01:36:21,960
What's more, there was a triangle.
It all took on meaning!

1679
01:36:22,889 --> 01:36:25,562
Beautiful... It was as if
the damned Pythagoreans

1680
01:36:25,729 --> 01:36:27,162
were on your side.

1681
01:36:27,409 --> 01:36:30,048
It was perfect,
but what's more important,

1682
01:36:30,209 --> 01:36:31,927
it was totally inoffensive.

1683
01:36:32,249 --> 01:36:33,967
Until the madman appeared.

1684
01:36:34,729 --> 01:36:37,960
Any one of our acts can have
unexpected consequences.

1685
01:36:38,129 --> 01:36:39,244
That's what you most feared.

1686
01:36:40,489 --> 01:36:41,717
Who was to know that poor devil

1687
01:36:41,889 --> 01:36:43,880
was going to read
the article in the paper?

1688
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:46,722
He was looking for a solution
to his daughter's problem,

1689
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:49,688
while every day he drove to school
those healthy children

1690
01:36:49,849 --> 01:36:52,044
with perfect lungs
but damaged brains.

1691
01:36:52,569 --> 01:36:54,605
Why did they deserve to live
and not his daughter?

1692
01:36:55,089 --> 01:36:58,877
Mathematicians are not the only ones
familiar with the Greeks, professor.

1693
01:36:59,089 --> 01:37:02,161
You gave him his solution
when you published the series.

1694
01:37:02,329 --> 01:37:04,445
He also wanted to hide his crime.

1695
01:37:04,729 --> 01:37:06,924
He only had to make
a phone call, and he did.

1696
01:37:18,369 --> 01:37:19,518
So...

1697
01:37:21,209 --> 01:37:22,608
you think I'm the killer.

1698
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:24,564
No.

1699
01:37:24,849 --> 01:37:26,487
You haven't killed anyone,

1700
01:37:27,009 --> 01:37:30,604
but you're guilty of provoking the
deaths of those innocent children.

1701
01:37:31,289 --> 01:37:33,086
You're guilty of arrogance,

1702
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:36,042
of using us all like
pieces on a board game.

1703
01:37:37,089 --> 01:37:38,920
Who the hell do you think you are?

1704
01:37:41,809 --> 01:37:45,597
I hope my failure has, at least,
served to teach you something.

1705
01:37:47,489 --> 01:37:49,241
Yes, one thing.

1706
01:37:49,969 --> 01:37:51,960
One very painful thing.

1707
01:37:52,849 --> 01:37:54,646
Numbers also lie.

1708
01:37:55,089 --> 01:37:57,967
The truth is not mathematical,
as I once believed.

1709
01:37:58,369 --> 01:38:00,803
It's absurd, confused, random,

1710
01:38:00,969 --> 01:38:03,358
disorderly, and deeply unpleasant.

1711
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:07,605
I'm glad that finally we can agree
on something, Martin, my friend.

1712
01:38:08,489 --> 01:38:10,639
Just one thing has escaped you.

1713
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:16,647
The real culprit.

1714
01:38:18,249 --> 01:38:21,127
The one who triggered off
this whole string of crimes.

1715
01:38:21,289 --> 01:38:22,608
Who?

1716
01:38:22,769 --> 01:38:23,884
You, Martin.

1717
01:38:25,049 --> 01:38:26,198
Don't make me laugh.

1718
01:38:26,369 --> 01:38:28,644
If you don't believe me,
then speak to Beth.

1719
01:38:29,489 --> 01:38:31,047
She was in love with you,

1720
01:38:31,889 --> 01:38:33,447
or weren't you aware of that?

1721
01:38:34,769 --> 01:38:37,363
She remembered
your words exactly.

1722
01:38:38,969 --> 01:38:40,561
"You should try it. "

1723
01:38:41,129 --> 01:38:44,280
"You should try it,"
pounded time and again

1724
01:38:44,449 --> 01:38:46,326
inside her head, like a hammer.

1725
01:38:47,369 --> 01:38:49,564
"You should be free, like me. "

1726
01:38:51,889 --> 01:38:53,766
That's what she understood,

1727
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:56,687
and that's what she did.

1728
01:38:58,049 --> 01:39:00,882
Put an end to what
prevented her from being free...

1729
01:39:04,209 --> 01:39:05,881
her own mother.

1730
01:39:07,209 --> 01:39:08,198
The butterfly

1731
01:39:09,609 --> 01:39:12,077
that flutters its wings
and causes a hurricane

1732
01:39:12,249 --> 01:39:14,126
on the other side of the world.

1733
01:39:16,529 --> 01:39:18,201
Sound familiar?

1734
01:39:21,009 --> 01:39:23,762
Are you that butterfly, Martin?
