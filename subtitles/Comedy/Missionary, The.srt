1
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,545
What's your poison?

2
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,488
Tequila.

3
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,197
- No lime, no salt.
- Coming right up.

4
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:50,094
Man, I never saw anybody drink tequila
like that and still read the Bible.

5
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,296
It's exactly the kind of medicine
this town needs.

6
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:57,010
- You know what I mean?
- I know exactly what you mean.

7
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:04,534
Look, you fucking loser.
You owe us two grand.

8
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,931
We want our fucking money.

9
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,958
- Hit him!
- Pay up, fool!

10
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,721
Asshole!

11
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:18,352
Quit messing around
and pay us our damn money.

12
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:31,791
Back off, man. It's none of your business.

13
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:34,828
God damn it, get out of the way,
or we're going to beat you, too.

14
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:37,934
Hey, mister. Step back.

15
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:59,694
- That was good.
- Shit.

16
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:19,315
Hey, mister. Thanks a lot. I'm Billy.

17
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:24,237
Which way to the cemetery?

18
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:31,442
Up that way. Over the bridge.
You can't miss it.

19
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:36,460
My... My hat, mister.

20
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,598
My condolences.

21
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:38,124
I guess I could say a few words
for our dearly departed brother

22
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:40,850
from the book of Samuel.

23
00:08:55,891 --> 00:09:01,074
"The Lord brings death and makes alive,

24
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:05,230
"he brings down to the grave and raises up.

25
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:11,853
"The Lord sends poverty and wealth,
he humbles, he exalts.

26
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:16,526
"He raises the poor from the dust,
and the needy from the ash heap,

27
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:20,785
"he seats them with princes

28
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:23,818
"and has them inherit a throne of honor."

29
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,462
Amen.

30
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,834
Excuse me.

31
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,999
You read from the Bible.
It was very kind of you.

32
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:08,645
Thanks.

33
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:14,250
You got a minute?
I'd like to introduce you to the family.

34
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,267
This is my father, White Deer.

35
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,035
And this is my son, Junior.

36
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:32,911
This is my daughter, Kiowa.

37
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:41,989
Everybody loved JJ.
Did you serve together?

38
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:47,052
- You could say that.
- Were you in his unit?

39
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,518
'Cause I don't see you in the pictures.

40
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:57,128
- You know, they say he drowned in a river.
- Yeah, right.

41
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,008
Take your hat off.

42
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:21,704
There's a heck of a nice bike out there.
Who does that belong to, you?

43
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:29,580
I don't believe we've met. John Reno.
A pleasure.

44
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:32,612
Are you... You a friend of JJ's, are you?

45
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,461
Yeah, well, he's a good man.
You going to stay with us long?

46
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,271
Maybe.

47
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:43,434
Well, I heard about
your little adventure in town, there.

48
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:46,825
Trying to help that druggie kid out?

49
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:50,222
I got to tell you, it's no offense,
but you're wasting your time.

50
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,292
Ain't much of your business.

51
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,529
Anyway, you need anything,
you let me know, all right?

52
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,232
You said you were from up north,
is that right?

53
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:02,668
Boy, boy, he's talking to you.

54
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,579
Peace, brother.
This is a time for mourning, not fighting.

55
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,259
Murph, not yet.

56
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:27,367
Let go of me.
And don't you ever touch me again.

57
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,252
Easy, darling, I'm not going to hurt you.

58
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:33,291
Prettiest girl in town,
won't give me the time of day.

59
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,309
How you figure that, Murph?

60
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:39,148
Look, I'm all broke up about JJ,
just like you are. He's a friend of mine.

61
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:43,337
Besides, I... I just want to warn you...

62
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:47,627
A lot of bad things happening
in this town to people right now,

63
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:51,021
especially folks who don't
mind their own business.

64
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:55,458
You understand? Saddle up, fellas.

65
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,822
Come see me at the dealership.

66
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,097
Hi, there. What can I get you, mister?

67
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:54,636
- I guess l'll settle for a room.
- Okay. Well, let's see.

68
00:14:54,733 --> 00:15:00,167
Since we only get a few customers
each week, I think we can fit you in.

69
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,089
- Staying long?
- How much for a week?

70
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:08,996
Okay. Well, let's see. That's 50 bucks a day,

71
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:13,126
and one day free
for our seven-day special rate.

72
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,194
Let's call it an even 300.

73
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,580
You must be here for the funeral.

74
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:24,810
JJ was a good man. Great carpenter.

75
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:30,697
Used to help me with the little things
around here, whenever he had the time.

76
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,973
201.

77
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:37,448
If you need anything, just let me know.

78
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:41,291
Will do.

79
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:52,522
- Is that him?
- No fucking way.

80
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,172
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's him.

81
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:59,073
That motherfucker.
Who's he think he's messing with?

82
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,494
Back off, hound dog.

83
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:36,138
- He's at the hotel, boss.
- He's at the hotel.

84
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:38,056
Why don't you thrill me
with your analysis, Murph.

85
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:41,286
What do you think he is? ATF, Fed, what?

86
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,136
It's kind of hard to tell.

87
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,608
The folks down at the funeral
said he's pretty harmless.

88
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:53,701
I mean, he reads the Bible, drinks tequila.
Pretty much keeps to himself.

89
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,817
I see.

90
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:59,177
He took us by surprise, boss.
It's not going to happen again.

91
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:01,642
It better not happen again.

92
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:08,361
So from now on,
it's just going to be business as usual

93
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,721
here on this great reservation.

94
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,121
Yeah, right. Business as usual, boss.

95
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:20,133
You just keep a goddamn eye
on our mystery man.

96
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:23,297
- What?
- The biker with the fucking Bible, Gomez.

97
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:25,093
Pay attention.

98
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:28,455
I want you to put a couple of men on him.
Especially tonight.

99
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,211
I don't want any problems,
not with this shipment,

100
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:33,095
and I don't want people thinking
I'm starting to lose my grip

101
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:36,641
on this miserable excuse for a town.
You understand?

102
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:41,350
- Sure thing, boss.
- Murph? Murph?

103
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,766
- Yes, sir, boss.
- Good.

104
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:52,608
Come on, Reno. Come over here and ride me
like the cowboy I know you are.

105
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:55,713
I'm here, darling. I'm going to saddle you up
like a quarter horse.

106
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:01,064
Shaved just like I like it.
You taste like a peach.

107
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:20,356
Heard you were a friend of JJ's.

108
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,755
- That's right.
- Well, that's real nice.

109
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,009
Funeral's over. He's dead and buried.

110
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,782
So what are you still doing here?

111
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:52,616
I've got my eyes on you. Remember that.

112
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:56,008
Stay out of trouble.

113
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:36,835
Oh, my lovely young bird.
Hurt, angry, lonely and nowhere to fly.

114
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:43,037
He didn't drown.
JJ knew something about Reno.

115
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:55,326
Oh, sweetheart,
I know how close you were to JJ.

116
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:57,853
He was like a father to you.

117
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:01,568
But you have to think
of the rest of the family now.

118
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:08,483
We have to be careful. Reno can do just
about anything he wants to in this town.

119
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:10,590
He didn't drown.

120
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:28,773
You're upset about JJ, huh?

121
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,734
Do you really think
that Reno tried to kill him?

122
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:36,318
- It's crazy.
- I just can't take it anymore.

123
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:42,652
But, Kiowa, if that happened to him because
of what we're trying to do, what about us?

124
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:46,976
JJ was right.

125
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:52,804
I mean, other Tribal Council members
might be on Reno's side.

126
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,496
That's crazy.

127
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,529
Let's see what happens. I bet JJ was right.

128
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:43,713
The Council meeting is getting ready
to start, so everyone come in.

129
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:19,715
Welcome, everyone.
This Tribal Council is in session.

130
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:25,892
We are finally ready to decide on two
proposals for this Council from last month.

131
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,539
I wanted to postpone
today's meeting, because of JJ.

132
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:37,664
We all loved him. He was one of the most
respected members of this Council.

133
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:45,155
Assistant Chief Lance suggested
we still discuss the Gaming 3 proposal.

134
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:49,628
The Tribal Council has carefully studied
and weighed the advantages

135
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:53,246
and disadvantages of both proposals.

136
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:58,652
We've had a proposal for the building
of a casino on the Tribal property,

137
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,170
by Lance's construction group.

138
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:09,887
This proposal would bring many new jobs
and much revenue for our people.

139
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:16,032
However, I'm very concerned with the many
negative aspects of this proposal.

140
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:21,699
For now, there's a very innovative
on-line gaming alternative,

141
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:27,741
proposed by the late JJ,
his sister Nancy and their family.

142
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:31,456
This proposal offers
more highly-skilled jobs

143
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:36,825
and training for our people,
and takes advantage of the gaming profits

144
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,787
without the negative aspects.

145
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:46,141
I will recommend this proposal
to the Council.

146
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:53,667
- And as you all know, my veto counts.
- Dan, we need to rethink this.

147
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:58,265
There is too much money on the table
for this tribe to lose.

148
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:03,164
I'm sorry. My decision is final.

149
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:18,622
- This is ridiculous.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

150
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:22,043
Don't worry about it. L'll take care of it.

151
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,573
So, how was everything?

152
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:40,602
Not bad.

153
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,724
Well, I don't know how to say this,

154
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:51,612
- but you don't look like a mean, old biker.
- Now, why is that?

155
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:55,064
For starters, you wear
funny-looking reading glasses,

156
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:58,817
and you read the Bible, and drink tequila.

157
00:24:59,842 --> 00:25:02,264
And just the way you talk and treat people.

158
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,725
I heard about that fight this morning.

159
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:09,630
It's a really nice thing you did
for that kid, Billy, and all.

160
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,861
- So I don't want to be prying, but...
- Then don't.

161
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:38,908
Hey, dude. Dude, come here.
I heard you were still here, man.

162
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:45,505
I'm just... Just thought
I'd let you know that... There was...

163
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:50,143
Those guys you beat up, man?
They work for this guy, Reno.

164
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:53,494
The guy runs the whole town.
He's got everybody scared.

165
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:55,838
You know what I mean...

166
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:58,974
Reno, huh?

167
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,090
Yeah, man. These guys, they...

168
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,987
They drowned somebody in the river,
if you know what I mean.

169
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,590
I know exactly what you mean.

170
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:18,113
- You want some coffee?
- No.

171
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:26,395
- So what's on your mind?
- Everybody's favorite citizen, Reno.

172
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:31,385
- We have to do something about him.
- Well, it ain't that simple.

173
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:36,506
The last time I tried to have an investigation,
it was called off quickly, by that judge.

174
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,086
JJ's drowning was no accident.

175
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:44,381
Nancy, we're all going to miss JJ,

176
00:26:44,512 --> 00:26:48,572
but accusing Reno
is not going to bring him back.

177
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:51,704
And it's only going to cause
more problems for you.

178
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:53,467
Come on, Sheriff.

179
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,053
Now, you be careful.

180
00:26:57,184 --> 00:27:02,104
Stay out of Reno's way,
because he's a very dangerous man.

181
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:05,658
Come back anytime.

182
00:27:07,937 --> 00:27:09,759
You have a nice day, okay?

183
00:27:10,656 --> 00:27:11,933
That's it?

184
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:15,100
That's it.

185
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:22,427
Now, when I was a boy,

186
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:25,790
the government came and took me away
from my mother and dad,

187
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:29,271
and put me in what they call
a residential school.

188
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:32,572
They cut my hair off. My hair was long.

189
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:35,612
And I couldn't speak my language.

190
00:27:35,743 --> 00:27:39,834
If I spoke my language, they would beat me.
That's why a lot of people my age

191
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:43,733
can't speak our language anymore,
because it was beaten out of us.

192
00:27:50,143 --> 00:27:54,781
I am looking at the eagle up there.
You share the same fate.

193
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:59,511
You are destined to soar free,
above all others,

194
00:27:59,617 --> 00:28:04,253
carried by the wind
and feared by those below.

195
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:14,676
Now, in our culture, four is a sacred number
because everything grows in fours.

196
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:21,626
The seed, the branches
and the fruit and the leaves.

197
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:26,746
And when we pray, we pray to the Creator,
we pray in four directions.

198
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:32,696
And the four winds come in four directions.
So four is a very sacred number for us.

199
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,555
Don't worry about it.
Mom will take care of it.

200
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,900
- You coming?
- I'm going to wait here.

201
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:10,492
Hey, there. L'll just take some of these.

202
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:16,252
So that day my Uncle JJ drowned,
he came here first, right?

203
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:20,056
- So what?
- I'm just asking.

204
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,110
Look...

205
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,369
He came in, got a case of beer.

206
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:32,154
And the Sheriff has already
asked me about that.

207
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:34,774
They said he was drunk when he drowned.

208
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:38,391
- Yeah, I heard.
- You know he didn't drink.

209
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,247
Who was the beer for, then? Reno?
'Cause Reno drinks beer.

210
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:57,177
- Hey, was Reno with him that day?
- Look, I'm busy.

211
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,019
- You're such a loser.
- You want to pay for that?

212
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:15,571
Good afternoon, miss.
Can I help you with those candy bars?

213
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:21,115
I heard that you
were at the Tribal Council meeting today.

214
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:24,028
What did the old fools have to say?
Anything interesting?

215
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:26,297
Hey, just let him go.

216
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:30,488
I asked you a question, little lady.
Anything interesting?

217
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:34,581
Yeah.
But it's above your kindergarten education.

218
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:39,545
That's wasn't very nice.

219
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,532
You need to tell
your mother something for me.

220
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:44,509
She needs to drop
that idiotic gaming proposal of hers.

221
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:48,150
Hey, that's none of your business.
Just let him go.

222
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:51,100
He's just fine.

223
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:54,098
- How old are you, sweetheart?
- Fifteen.

224
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:56,059
Nice, nice, nice.

225
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:59,386
How'd you like to come hang out at the pool
with me and the boys?

226
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:02,385
We sure would love to see you in a bikini.

227
00:31:02,492 --> 00:31:07,097
Yeah... But you know what?
Maybe we don't even have to go anywhere.

228
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:18,488
Hey, hey. Come on, man.
Look, I don't think this is such a good idea.

229
00:31:18,621 --> 00:31:20,792
- She's just a kid.
- What, are you going soft on us, Hoss?

230
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:23,226
Get over there and do your fucking job.

231
00:31:23,324 --> 00:31:24,852
Since when did we become child molesters?

232
00:31:24,988 --> 00:31:26,744
Just back off, man.

233
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,275
You just keep on riding, mister.
This ain't none of your business.

234
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:44,407
Everything you do from now on
is my business.

235
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:49,624
You fucking asshole.
We own this town, and the Sheriff included.

236
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:05,332
No, stop! He tried to helped me.

237
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:15,383
All right, man. Get out of here.

238
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:29,972
- I'm fine. I think so.
- Are you sure?

239
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:32,213
- L'll take you home. All right?
- All right.

240
00:32:32,347 --> 00:32:34,552
You follow. Let's go.

241
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:54,615
- Why don't you come have some dinner?
- My mom's a really good cook.

242
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:06,898
Haven't had home cooking in a while,
especially not this good.

243
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:15,984
Hey, thanks for what you did.
Nobody stands up to Reno.

244
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,937
His family's got too many
connections in this town.

245
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:23,376
People like Reno,
you just got to stand up and fight back.

246
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:27,887
For some folks,
it's the only thing they understand.

247
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,687
So you travel around on your bike
all the time, and help people?

248
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:42,256
Yep. I tend to move around a lot,
and things just happen along the way.

249
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,937
- Doesn't it get lonely?
- Nope.

250
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:49,433
You know, you remind me so much of JJ.

251
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:53,326
- He was always helping people out.
- Yeah. And look what happened to him.

252
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:56,083
- Junior.
- Soon as I'm 18, I'm getting out of here.

253
00:33:57,209 --> 00:34:00,242
There's no way I'm going to end up like him.

254
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:04,655
It's a real shame that in today's day and age,
we couldn't find the evil that took him.

255
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:12,048
My grandfather was born a free Indian,
before the reservations, before the Civil War,

256
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:17,553
before the railway, even.
Now they're poisoning our youth.

257
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:23,856
And for what? The white man's evil.
Alcohol, drugs and money.

258
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,210
Greed is the evil that killed my son.

259
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:32,818
He was a good warrior for our people,
and a great son.

260
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:43,223
Kiowa, honey? Why don't you
take our guest outside for some fresh air?

261
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:46,200
We can have dessert later.

262
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:04,531
And you, where's your family?

263
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:11,248
Well, my family is my friends and my faith.

264
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:15,799
Oh, and my bike.

265
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:22,902
Well, you have friends here, now.
So I guess that makes us family, huh?

266
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:26,837
It looks like it.

267
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:34,293
I know what you mean, though.

268
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:39,181
It's like you're searching for something
or someone you can never find.

269
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:45,744
You have a few years to figure it all out.

270
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:49,142
But sometimes the answer
is closer than you think.

271
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:58,130
Well, I never knew my father, you know.

272
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:03,406
JJ always took care of me,
like the father I never had.

273
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:08,913
I just miss him a lot.

274
00:36:11,288 --> 00:36:13,176
It's just so unfair.

275
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:16,430
He's like here one day
and then gone the next.

276
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:19,412
I just don't understand it.

277
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:26,832
Sometimes things are better left alone,
not understood.

278
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:31,794
That's easy for you to say.
You just beat up anyone you want.

279
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:38,285
Don't you have a girlfriend?

280
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,298
White Deer is a wise old man.

281
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:50,836
- He's seen many things in his lifetime.
- Yeah, he likes you.

282
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:55,217
- You want to go say good night to him?
- Yeah, all right.

283
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:27,501
Put your weapons on the ground.
Put them on the ground! Now!

284
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:32,083
Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.

285
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:33,609
It's that simple.

286
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:39,310
Alex, jump down there and grab those bags.

287
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:44,010
Put them on the boat, one at a time.

288
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,336
Hurry! Let's go! Let's go!

289
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:51,785
Put it all on the boat, every single
one of them. Don't miss anything.

290
00:38:52,757 --> 00:38:54,961
That's it.

291
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,347
Hold your fire, God damn it!

292
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:10,669
Boss, one's getting away!

293
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:12,463
Well, what are you looking at? Go get him!

294
00:39:12,596 --> 00:39:14,484
Bullseye Bill.

295
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:15,757
Son of a bitch!

296
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:37,585
- Where's he now?
- On the way. Leave it.

297
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:43,691
- Where the hell is he?
- I think we lost him.

298
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:47,184
- The boss is going to kick our ass.
- Shut up.

299
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:50,865
What is this?

300
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:52,780
All right, that's enough.

301
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:56,395
Come on back to the boat.
Come get back here, and get on board.

302
00:39:56,499 --> 00:39:58,092
Let's get out of here.

303
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:45,838
- I want to know who the runaway was.
- Sure thing, boss.

304
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:49,583
And who the hell is he?
And who else knows about the deal?

305
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:53,612
- Got some good news for you.
- That'd be a relief.

306
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:55,176
We found this.

307
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:58,512
It's pretty. What the hell is it?

308
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,871
Billy.
The Indian kid that owes us two grand.

309
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,531
Oh yeah, Billy.

310
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:08,816
Murph, I want you to take some guys
and find that runaway piece of shit,

311
00:41:08,947 --> 00:41:11,696
and I want him dead. Understand?

312
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:14,695
You got it, boss.
I know just where to look for him.

313
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:15,915
Good.

314
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:52,586
Big night in Black River. It's Saturday night.
You mind if I join you?

315
00:41:53,521 --> 00:41:57,133
- Go ahead. Have a seat.
- Let's do a shot first.

316
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,919
I've had this hotel for eight years now.
I used to hate the big city.

317
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,490
Now I kind of miss it.
Just trying to save enough money,

318
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:28,237
find me a good man
and get the hell out of here.

319
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:37,354
Thinking of you.

320
00:42:39,313 --> 00:42:43,371
Go have a drink, have fun.
Did I buy you that outfit?

321
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:49,542
You can never spend too much
on a good-looking woman.

322
00:42:50,545 --> 00:42:51,689
Right.

323
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:55,207
So what are we playing here, chief?
A little eight ball?

324
00:42:55,313 --> 00:42:56,906
Stripes or solids?

325
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,553
No more killing.

326
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:05,064
- I cannot be involved in this anymore.
- Excuse me.

327
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:11,303
We got to be more careful.
Your methods, they're crude.

328
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:15,783
- They attract way too much attention.
- My methods, huh?

329
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:18,793
Why don't you just worry
about your end of the deal?

330
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:20,968
Let me worry about mine, okay?

331
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,331
Damn, I need some more limes.
L'll be right back.

332
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:32,679
Hey, little lady. Why don't you just put
that pretty little ass of yours

333
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:34,758
- down in this chair?
- And why don't you just have a seat?

334
00:43:34,896 --> 00:43:38,060
- I've got to go to the kitchen.
- Better than that, how about in my lap?

335
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,357
- Now, come on.
- Excuse me, miss. Hold this.

336
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:47,213
- So, gentlemen, is there a problem?
- Yeah, you.

337
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:58,859
Bottom line, you know it and I know it,
is if I don't deliver this...

338
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,131
This casino to the boys up north
on a silver platter,

339
00:44:01,232 --> 00:44:02,573
they're going to be pissed off.

340
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:05,006
And no matter what happens,
they're going to want their money.

341
00:44:05,168 --> 00:44:06,543
You understand?

342
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,527
- Yeah, yeah.
- Corner pocket.

343
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:12,300
Yeah, I thought we had the Council with us
on that thing.

344
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,471
That casino deal,
that should have been ours.

345
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:17,291
Well, then why does JJ's family
control the project?

346
00:44:17,392 --> 00:44:20,458
Did you or did you not tell me
if I got JJ out of the way,

347
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,414
the Tribal Council would be forced
to give us the project?

348
00:44:22,511 --> 00:44:24,202
- Isn't that what you told me?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

349
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:26,408
All right. I hear what you're saying.

350
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:29,609
- Just let me see what I can do on it.
- Too late for that.

351
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,654
You see, now, I got to wipe out
the whole fucking family,

352
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,286
just to make my point.

353
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:35,912
That's what I'm talking about,
your methods, man.

354
00:44:36,047 --> 00:44:40,651
Yeah. They're effective, every time.
Side pocket.

355
00:44:41,488 --> 00:44:45,000
Thanks for coming.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it or not.

356
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,113
I want to show you something.

357
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:49,929
Look who decided to show up.

358
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:55,562
- Oh, good. Perfect timing.
- Hi, Dad.

359
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:05,512
So today, we have a very special guest,
and he's going to talk to us about the Bible.

360
00:45:05,647 --> 00:45:08,494
So I want you to say a very friendly hello
to our family friend.

361
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,312
Hi.

362
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:15,179
All right. Do you know what this is?

363
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:17,035
The Bible.

364
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:23,076
I need these to see the words.

365
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,997
"Show me your ways, oh Lord.

366
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:34,732
"Teach me your paths.
Remember not the sins of my youth

367
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:40,710
"and my rebellious ways.
Good and upright is the Lord.

368
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:43,694
"Therefore, he instructs sinners in his ways.

369
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:50,435
"He guides the humble in what is right
and teaches them his way."

370
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:56,166
You see, the Bible, it's like a guidebook.

371
00:45:57,037 --> 00:45:59,591
It helps us lead a good, honest life.

372
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:02,374
Mom, come down here! Hurry!

373
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:18,086
Oh, man, I didn't... I didn't mean to...

374
00:46:19,406 --> 00:46:23,977
- I didn't know where else to go.
- Let's get him to the house.

375
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:31,079
You're lucky to be alive.
We got to get him to a clinic.

376
00:46:31,213 --> 00:46:33,996
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait a second.

377
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,395
Hold this.

378
00:46:43,756 --> 00:46:45,284
Let's go, kids.

379
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:50,947
Go!

380
00:46:56,076 --> 00:47:00,386
I knew about this drug deal going on,
down... Down by the river.

381
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:06,600
I was just hoping I could
make a score, you know?

382
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,204
But I didn't know Reno
was going to be there.

383
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:14,057
And I sure as shit didn't know
he was going to be killing everybody.

384
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:15,236
Shit.

385
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,806
Reno's guys, they were chasing me
through the woods, man.

386
00:47:22,316 --> 00:47:28,132
My necklace! I lost my necklace! Fuck!

387
00:47:38,796 --> 00:47:43,073
- Shit! Oh, fuck, it is them!
- Stay inside no matter what happens.

388
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:14,757
This is serious business, mister.

389
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,313
We don't want any trouble from you.

390
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:19,906
We're looking for an Indian, Billy.

391
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:24,545
He was shot, and we heard
he was around here somewhere.

392
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:29,797
He stole something from us.
We need to find him.

393
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:36,288
Go ahead and call the Sheriff.
You can use the phone inside.

394
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:45,479
No can do, mister. But you know that.

395
00:48:47,435 --> 00:48:49,606
No, this is our problem, and

396
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:54,563
we're gonna deal with it ourselves,
the old-fashioned way.

397
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:59,973
Well, I'm sorry. Can't help you boys.

398
00:49:02,123 --> 00:49:06,911
Well, it looks like we might have ourselves
a little problem here, now, don't we?

399
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:13,991
It was the kids that told us where the
bleeding Indian was by the old campground.

400
00:49:14,123 --> 00:49:17,571
You should have seen
those little runts shitting themselves.

401
00:49:23,115 --> 00:49:27,871
When I got a job to do,
nobody better stand in my way.

402
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:34,624
So you better back the fuck off
and move on, or else...

403
00:49:37,323 --> 00:49:39,592
What you gonna do now, preacher man?

404
00:49:40,234 --> 00:49:45,253
Well, I'm going to ask you
to beg the good Lord's forgiveness,

405
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:54,559
but not before I take this knee
and break that nose.

406
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,548
And you know what?

407
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:04,194
What?

408
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:09,636
There ain't nothing you can do about it.

409
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:15,973
Fuck you.

410
00:50:27,144 --> 00:50:29,566
You don't know how to use that.

411
00:50:31,624 --> 00:50:34,080
Well, that's one way of using it.

412
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:38,246
Okay! Okay! We get your point!
We get your point!

413
00:50:47,433 --> 00:50:49,090
All right. Drop your pants.

414
00:50:49,192 --> 00:50:52,323
- Wait a minute.
- Drop 'em!

415
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,720
Drop your pants. You, too. Go ahead!

416
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,564
Now, get out of here.

417
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:18,310
- Asshole!
- Fucker!

418
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:28,447
Be sure to take them someplace safe.

419
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:31,584
Don't worry.
Not even Reno knows of this place.

420
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:35,808
Our ancestors always spoke of a man
that would come from the north,

421
00:51:35,912 --> 00:51:39,686
followed by the evil. Take care, my friend.

422
00:51:40,423 --> 00:51:42,365
My prayers are with you.

423
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:45,791
This is it, isn't it?

424
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:48,994
I'm never going to see you again,
no matter what.

425
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,644
Sometimes it's better this way.

426
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:56,548
Let's go.

427
00:52:21,223 --> 00:52:22,914
You got a choice to make.

428
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:25,730
We'll help you out.
But after you go to the doctor,

429
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,903
you have to testify against Reno.

430
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:32,230
Otherwise, you can go out there right now,
and deal with Reno yourself.

431
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:40,352
All right. Okay, fine. L'll do it.

432
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,926
Otherwise, I'm a dead man, right?

433
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:03,995
We've got an assault and battery,
here, at Route 61.

434
00:53:04,103 --> 00:53:06,045
Sending in backup.

435
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:11,846
Witness reports that Reno's men were seen
leaving the area, so keep an eye out. 10-4.

436
00:53:42,341 --> 00:53:45,986
Sheriff, we have Reno cold.
Billy was shot last night.

437
00:53:47,526 --> 00:53:49,565
- You have what?
- You have to go and arrest him.

438
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:53,598
- He ain't exactly the best witness.
- Billy saw Reno commit murder.

439
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:14,370
Afternoon, folks.
You having a little pow-wow out here?

440
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:17,601
Hell, I wish I'd known,
I'd put an eagle feather in my hat.

441
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:22,109
- You got a van full of sick kids, Sheriff?
- What do you want, Reno?

442
00:54:22,245 --> 00:54:24,765
Well, since you asked so kindly,

443
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:27,389
a couple of my men are thinking
about filing assault charges

444
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:29,664
against this one, here,
for beating the shit out of 'em.

445
00:54:29,797 --> 00:54:32,699
I'm thinking about filing vandalism charges
for damage done to my vehicle

446
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:33,820
up on the Adobe Flats.

447
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:36,227
Hell, I've already talked to a judge.

448
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:39,869
Self-defense, as the Lord is my witness.

449
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:42,853
Well, let's talk about that, you and me.

450
00:54:42,981 --> 00:54:46,462
Let's say we go have a drink at my bar
and talk things over.

451
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:50,394
- Sure, why not?
- Good. Follow me.

452
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:52,922
Y'all have a good afternoon.

453
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:57,145
Relax. Everybody relax.

454
00:54:57,508 --> 00:54:58,818
I'm going to have a little talk
with my friend, here.

455
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:59,898
Have a little drink.

456
00:55:00,037 --> 00:55:02,883
See if we can work something out.
Give me a beer.

457
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:06,243
And then give this man whatever he wants.

458
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,540
- Gracias.
- Tequila, straight up. No lime, no salt.

459
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,543
Look, here it is.

460
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,476
I don't give a fuck who you are
or where you came from.

461
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,230
I damn sure don't give a fuck
why you're here.

462
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:32,990
The way I see it, we got three options.

463
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:36,637
First is, I can just kill you now,
and be done with it.

464
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,595
The second, you can walk
out of this bar alive,

465
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:41,375
get on your iron horse, and ride out of town.

466
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:44,356
Never look back.
And when you're gone, you stay gone.

467
00:55:44,548 --> 00:55:46,784
Third option, and for my money,
the most interesting, is

468
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:48,541
you could come to work for me.

469
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:52,187
Hell, I could use a man with your skills and
your... How did you put that, Gomez?

470
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:55,140
Your spiritual disposition.

471
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:59,872
Might even help my reputation.
What do you say?

472
00:56:07,972 --> 00:56:13,438
First, your reputation is bad.
It's always going to be bad,

473
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:14,751
no matter who works for you.

474
00:56:14,852 --> 00:56:21,442
Second, I don't like people that take
advantage of others for power and money.

475
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,768
And, third,

476
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,467
I don't like you, Reno.

477
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,623
Well, l'll take that as a "no."

478
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,252
Thanks for the drink.

479
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:43,769
- Don't walk away from me.
- Hold it.

480
00:57:15,138 --> 00:57:20,255
Wait, wait, wait!
This holy man's day of reckoning is at hand.

481
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:28,415
Stop! I said stop, God damn it.
Nobody walks out on me.

482
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:31,361
Hold it! That's enough.

483
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:35,295
Now put your weapon down.

484
00:57:36,897 --> 00:57:42,113
- Sheriff, what do you think you're doing?
- Put your gun down or l'll put you down.

485
00:57:53,793 --> 00:57:56,990
Let's go find a little Indian boy to scalp.

486
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,872
Back in the bar. Move it.

487
00:58:16,418 --> 00:58:18,720
Damn, that was stupid.

488
00:58:18,818 --> 00:58:22,015
Now Reno's got me in his sights, too.

489
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:25,952
Yep.

490
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:29,977
I got to find your missing witness
before Reno does.

491
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:35,456
All right, Sheriff.

492
00:58:58,432 --> 00:59:00,320
I knew you'd come back.

493
00:59:09,665 --> 00:59:12,054
That's the gun they shot you with.

494
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:16,220
I got something else for you.

495
00:59:40,736 --> 00:59:44,795
"All my enemies are driven back.
They shall fall and perish at thy presence."

496
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:10,550
Murphy, I'm not interrupting you, am I?

497
01:00:13,215 --> 01:00:14,873
Did you make my call for me?

498
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,619
Yeah, yeah, I did, boss.
They'll be here tonight.

499
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:22,875
Well, good, good. That's grand.
It's about fucking time, too.

500
01:00:22,975 --> 01:00:26,749
Should have done this a long time ago.
Sugar plum? Honey?

501
01:00:26,846 --> 01:00:28,887
You don't mind if we
talk a little business, do you?

502
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:33,049
- All right.
- Move it!

503
01:00:37,855 --> 01:00:40,244
So, what did my buddy up north
have to say?

504
01:00:57,535 --> 01:00:58,812
Hurry!

505
01:01:43,423 --> 01:01:46,325
Thanks for coming, partner.
Glad you're here.

506
01:01:48,029 --> 01:01:50,417
The crew does look good.

507
01:01:50,525 --> 01:01:55,927
I see you still got the twins with you,
and they are still riding their own material.

508
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:59,410
- Never leave home without them.
- Business going well, I take it?

509
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,865
- Everything going smooth up north?
- I got no problems here.

510
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:07,196
You know, the usual, some killing,
some fucking. Lots of hard partying.

511
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:10,709
- That's what pays off in this business.
- Every time.

512
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:02,008
My problem is, I got a witness.

513
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:05,622
He's just a local Indian boy named Billy,
but he saw one of my drug raids go down.

514
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:11,028
And just seeing it go down, it's no big
deal in and of itself, but this one got ugly.

515
01:03:11,644 --> 01:03:14,328
It got messy in a hurry,
and somebody shot one of my men.

516
01:03:14,492 --> 01:03:17,144
All hell broke loose, and everybody died.

517
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:24,371
You fucked up.
Killing dealers wasn't part of the plan.

518
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,970
Now, the Mexicans are
going to want payback,

519
01:03:26,108 --> 01:03:28,497
and these Mexicans don't fuck around.

520
01:03:28,669 --> 01:03:29,846
You took their money. You took their drugs.

521
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,369
You probably killed
somebody's fucking cousin.

522
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,396
What were you thinking?

523
01:03:43,421 --> 01:03:46,715
- You still got the money and the drugs?
- Yeah, sure.

524
01:03:47,965 --> 01:03:50,135
This is what we're going to do.

525
01:03:50,268 --> 01:03:52,886
We're going to pin it on the Indian kid.

526
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:57,175
Put the money and the drugs on him.
Make sure the Sheriff finds him that way.

527
01:03:57,307 --> 01:04:00,407
- Dead, with all the shit on him.
- That's a damn good idea.

528
01:04:02,523 --> 01:04:04,181
- You think so, Reno?
- Yep.

529
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:10,096
I don't know, 'cause you still seem nervous.
Is there something you're not telling me?

530
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:19,350
A couple of days ago, this old boy comes
riding into town on a strange-looking bike.

531
01:04:20,284 --> 01:04:22,901
He starts beating up my men,
shooting up my bar,

532
01:04:23,003 --> 01:04:26,865
causing me all kinds of trouble
every day of the week.

533
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:30,900
Big, tall, rough-looking bastard.
Military training for sure.

534
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:33,619
And here's the weird thing.

535
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,586
He carries a Bible around with him
everywhere he goes.

536
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:42,907
Did you say he had a Bible?

537
01:04:43,002 --> 01:04:44,693
How do you know it wasn't just a big book?

538
01:04:44,827 --> 01:04:48,853
No, it was a Bible for sure.
My men even tell me he reads from it.

539
01:04:50,939 --> 01:04:56,950
- Is it a tall guy, blonde hair, old Hog?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's him exactly!

540
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:05,361
Lmpossible, I knew a guy like that once,
but that guy's dead.

541
01:05:05,499 --> 01:05:06,579
He's dead?

542
01:05:06,684 --> 01:05:11,702
Well, you fucked up, because
he's alive, and he's kicking my ass.

543
01:05:11,802 --> 01:05:16,820
I fucked up? Huh? I fucked up?

544
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:22,291
No, 'cause the way I see it, Reno, the only
one that's fucking up around here is you.

545
01:05:22,425 --> 01:05:24,979
Drug dealers are dead. Business is dead.

546
01:05:25,082 --> 01:05:27,667
You got a murder witness
running around free that should be dead.

547
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:31,567
And to top it all off,
we still don't have a fucking casino!

548
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:44,729
You got a nice place here, Reno.

549
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:48,819
I hope you don't mind if I live here
when you're dead.

550
01:05:52,218 --> 01:05:56,473
Come on. Let's go, you pieces
of white trash. Going to Black River.

551
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:44,087
- I wonder if my kids are okay.
- They're in good hands.

552
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:47,315
White Deer is a wise old man.

553
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:51,891
You remind me of their father.

554
01:06:52,344 --> 01:06:56,883
Every day I see their faces
and I think of him, and remember him

555
01:06:57,144 --> 01:06:59,348
and how much they miss him.

556
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:06,390
- Really?
- He was killed by a biker gang.

557
01:07:09,432 --> 01:07:14,550
Look, maybe something good
will come out of what I have to do here.

558
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,349
Just remember to make the most of it.

559
01:07:23,864 --> 01:07:27,574
Can't you wait till morning? Please don't go.

560
01:07:55,832 --> 01:07:57,358
It's a nightmare.

561
01:08:21,784 --> 01:08:23,726
You must be Billy.

562
01:08:25,207 --> 01:08:28,306
Nobody else could be stupid enough
to sit on my bike.

563
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:30,479
Yeah, I'm Billy.

564
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:32,372
Who the fuck are you?

565
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:49,330
- My name is Jarfe.
- That's a funny name. Jarfe.

566
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,686
You know, there's a funny story
that goes with that.

567
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:56,268
Well, my mother and father,
they were really bad drunks.

568
01:08:56,406 --> 01:08:59,473
And the last thing she gave me
before she died giving birth to me

569
01:08:59,608 --> 01:09:01,429
was this fucked-up name.

570
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,742
Now, long story short,
she's at the hospital, on a table,

571
01:09:06,262 --> 01:09:08,434
legs up in the stirrups,
and I come popping out.

572
01:09:08,567 --> 01:09:11,468
The nurse turns to her and says,
"What do you want to name him?"

573
01:09:11,607 --> 01:09:13,362
Now, she meant to say "Jeff."

574
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:17,899
But she was just so drunk and beaten,
you know, the old man busted her jaw,

575
01:09:18,038 --> 01:09:19,828
that it came out "Jarfe."

576
01:09:22,422 --> 01:09:24,790
And then she died a few minutes later.

577
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:29,646
So, I guess you could say I came into
this world a little fucked up, huh?

578
01:09:33,686 --> 01:09:35,508
Yeah.

579
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:38,191
All right, I want you to have this, right here.

580
01:09:38,326 --> 01:09:42,123
I don't do drugs, Billy, they're bad for you.

581
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:55,475
Man, please.

582
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:58,159
If this is about the other night, please, man.

583
01:09:58,262 --> 01:10:01,907
I promise I won't tell nobody.
I won't tell nobody, please.

584
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:05,265
Let me talk to Reno.
I talk to Reno, please, man.

585
01:10:10,391 --> 01:10:14,317
You redskin fucks'll never learn.
This is a white man's world.

586
01:10:32,277 --> 01:10:35,823
Not so fast.
You got an old biker staying here.

587
01:10:38,357 --> 01:10:43,507
- Tall guy, blonde? Reads the Bible.
- Screw you.

588
01:10:43,637 --> 01:10:48,144
That's the idea.
Listen, you dirty, little whore.

589
01:10:48,342 --> 01:10:50,610
Maybe you'd like to have this
conversation in private.

590
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:53,873
- I'm not a whore.
- That's what they all say.

591
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:58,320
Hey, what's going on?

592
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,716
Hey, up against the wall, asshole.

593
01:11:29,204 --> 01:11:32,685
- Is there a problem, officer?
- I said up against the wall!

594
01:12:00,532 --> 01:12:02,636
I'm sorry, did you say something?

595
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:35,120
- Kiowa, come back here! Come back.
- No, I'm going to help him.

596
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:02,672
There he is!

597
01:14:17,168 --> 01:14:19,471
Where do you think you're going?

598
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:22,609
- Billy's, uh...
- Yeah, I know.

599
01:14:22,705 --> 01:14:26,022
- Dead.
- So are my two deputies.

600
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,431
And you're not going in there.

601
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:33,863
All right, Sheriff.

602
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:39,789
But under the circumstances,
l'll make an exception.

603
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:58,826
They're on the other side of town,

604
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:01,645
- by the bank.
- Thank you, Dan.

605
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:05,129
Put your tampon back in
and go let them know.

606
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:06,956
All right, let's go.

607
01:15:07,664 --> 01:15:08,647
Come on.

608
01:15:20,624 --> 01:15:24,040
He's coming! He's coming!

609
01:15:44,783 --> 01:15:46,539
Hey man, over there.

610
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:58,350
You, go that way. You, go that way.

611
01:16:05,424 --> 01:16:10,541
Not even God himself can save the
holy man of this piece-of-shit town from me.

612
01:16:10,672 --> 01:16:13,519
L'll burn this fucking place to the ground.

613
01:20:26,379 --> 01:20:29,193
Can't anybody kill this fucking guy? Go!

614
01:20:40,714 --> 01:20:42,602
You gonna just sit there? Let's go.

615
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:38,917
Freeze! Nobody move!

616
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,998
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to find good help?

617
01:21:49,098 --> 01:21:52,360
Your holy man ought to be dead,
and so should you.

618
01:21:54,377 --> 01:21:56,419
I said, don't move.

619
01:22:23,465 --> 01:22:24,709
Come on.

620
01:22:40,745 --> 01:22:42,534
What you got?

621
01:22:42,665 --> 01:22:44,040
They're all dead.

622
01:22:44,137 --> 01:22:46,527
- All of them?
- Well, they look dead to me.

623
01:22:46,665 --> 01:22:48,901
If not dead, really fucked up.

624
01:23:47,463 --> 01:23:50,312
It's impossible. It can't be you.

625
01:23:54,248 --> 01:23:55,492
It's me.

626
01:24:18,855 --> 01:24:21,637
It's all there. The drugs and the money.

627
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:33,566
Your cousin judge
ain't going to help you now.

628
01:24:34,855 --> 01:24:35,804
Fine.

629
01:26:00,691 --> 01:26:17,647
THE END
