1
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,873
What's that?

2
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,910
Are you ready, Ma?
We don't have all day.

3
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,389
OK, keep your knickers on.
Almost there.

4
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,516
You're kidding me, right?

5
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,116
- Who put you in charge?
- Hiya.

6
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:09,919
All right. I'll get changed.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,797
- What's up?
- Guess.

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,875
- Now?
- No!

9
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,359
I have nothing else.

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,272
Just do it, would you?

11
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,393
Don't look at me.

12
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,749
Yeah, I do, yeah.

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,910
I do.

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,231
- Finally.
- Oh, Maura, you look gorgeous.

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,992
- What's he doing in there?
- Come on, Peter Perfect! You'll do!

16
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:53,594
Dessie, will you watch the bloody kids?

17
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:56,956
Come down here, you lot.
D'you hear me? Down!

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,033
Did they run out of material
when they were making that?

19
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:13,271
Yeah, they did. They used it all up
trying to cover your arse.

20
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,032
You little...

21
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:17,270
What am I gonna do? Look at it!

22
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,796
- What did you do that for? You eejit.
- What can we do?

23
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:22,996
Nothing. It's fucked.

24
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:26,038
We're gonna have to
call off the wedding.

25
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:28,953
- Good idea.
- Here, take mine, son.

26
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:32,032
- But what are you gonna wear?
- No worries. I've loads.

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,509
There, now.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,992
Thanks.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,836
You look lovely, by the way.

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,156
Thanks.

31
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:48,198
The car's here! Hurry!

32
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:51,158
D'you hear her? She thinks
she's the one getting married.

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,479
- You have told her, haven't you?
- Of course.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,635
- Everything?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,119
Nearly.

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,671
Oh! Tell me I don't look like
a fucking princess.

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,754
- I'll do your hair.
- Ma!

38
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:13,957
- No! It's mine!
- Bring it round.

39
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:16,031
- Ma!
- What are you doing?

40
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:19,237
- Don't push it. Steady as you go.
- Can you not wait till tomorrow?

41
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:22,153
Too late, love.
You haven't made a payment in months.

42
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:24,629
You can get it back
if somebody doesn't buy it.

43
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,110
- What are we supposed to sit on?
- I'm sure you'll find something.

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,679
- I'm getting it recovered.
- Maura O'Reilly?

45
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,070
- Maybe.
- There you go, love.

46
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,073
- Eviction notice? I don't want this.
- Don't shoot the messenger.

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,870
Molly, would you get my bag?
I think it's upstairs.

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,831
Oh. I didn't realise
things were that bad.

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,078
If you need some money, I have a bit.
I could lend it to you.

50
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:03,393
No, no. I have it under control.
But it's sweet of you to offer. Thanks.

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,031
Showtime.

52
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:13,477
There you are, me dears.
You look... marvellous, marvellous.

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,957
Stop!

54
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:36,634
- I need a quick one.
- What? You can't.

55
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,473
I'll just be a minute.
I need something to steady my nerves.

56
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:41,118
- No! Will you stop?
- Come on.

57
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:43,919
- Just a vodka. Molly...
- Stop. Drive! Drive!

58
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,710
- Just a little one.
- No!

59
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,634
Don't worry, Father.
She was late the last time, too.

60
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:54,871
- Last time?
- Yeah, this is our second.

61
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:58,077
- Second time getting married.
- What, the same girl?

62
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:03,188
Yeah. We had... Problems the first time

63
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:07,319
and got divorced, but we're sorted now.

64
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,110
Oh. It was meant to be so.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,876
Hmm.

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,236
Wait.

67
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,994
I'm... I'm not making
a big mistake, am I?

68
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:39,072
- But it's all arranged.
- I'm hearing alarms in my head.

69
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,549
They're the church bells, dummy.

70
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,034
It's up to you, love.

71
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,711
Come on.

72
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,239
Ah.

73
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,829
Hi.

74
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,634
Now, do you, Frederick Butler,
take Sophie Maguire...

75
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,472
...for your lawful wedded wife,

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,997
...to have and to hold,
from this day forward,

77
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,799
for better or for worse...

78
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:50,874
...for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

79
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:52,951
until death do you part?

80
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,676
I do.

81
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:04,875
I do.

82
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,109
I do.

83
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:09,633
I do.

84
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:13,599
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

85
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,671
You may kiss the bride.

86
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,831
- Ow!
- Sorry.

87
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,432
Well, congratulations again, Freddie.

88
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,470
We'll have a little chat later on, huh?

89
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,438
OK. Sure, Mr. Maguire, sure.

90
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,511
Sophie, breathe in.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,356
Oh! You have put on weight
since the last time.

92
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,233
Jesus Chr...

93
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,193
- I never thought I'd live to see this.
- Me neither.

94
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,999
I've managed to avoid it for 30 years
and now here I am,

95
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,594
and I'm not even gonna
get a ride tonight.

96
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,834
Right, let's get pissed.

97
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,835
Looks kosher to me, gov. Lunch?

98
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,832
Bit of a coincidence, isn't it,
with him up for deportation next week?

99
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:49,354
But it's Saturday.

100
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:52,716
Got something better to do, have you?
Big plans?

101
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:56,031
- No.
- A hot date? Washing your hair?

102
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:58,395
No, you don't.

103
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:01,836
And I am dying for a slash. Duck.

104
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,040
Molly.

105
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,628
I look like a hippo. I do, don't I?

106
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:13,109
You look gorgeous.
You look gorgeous.

107
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:17,352
Don't mind the old hag, eh?
Just relax. Just relax, come on.

108
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:20,637
- It's our perfect day.
- Yeah, you're right.

109
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:22,517
Come on, Sophie, relax.

110
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:23,237
Relax.

111
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,271
How are you doing, Dad?

112
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,834
- I'm fine, Molly. How are you?
- Very good. Thanks, Dad.

113
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,196
Haven't you got something for me?

114
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:46,271
Oh, yeah, um...

115
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,715
I'll give it to you later.

116
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,831
It's beautiful, isn't it?

117
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,391
- Oh!
- What? Oh.

118
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,956
- Did you see what that guy did?
- Who?

119
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:21,600
Bloody cheek.

120
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,399
Follow that car! Come back here,
fella, and do that again!

121
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,234
- I'll cut off your balubas!
- Oh! Found it.

122
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:31,039
- I'm talking to you! You!
- Oh, thank God.

123
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,232
- You Okay?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,833
Hey, beautiful.

125
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,556
Hello. Welcome to the Napoleon Hotel.

126
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,306
Hi.

127
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,511
Who's that?

128
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:07,472
Please, please, please, please,
please, be quiet! Please!

129
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:12,111
Nobody said anything to me about two
weddings. I booked this hotel for today.

130
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:15,272
- Hey, me too.
- Yeah, so did we, sunshine.

131
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,352
Do you mind? We're having
a private conversation with the manager.

132
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:19,102
Oh.

133
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,600
Hey. Shotgun wedding, was it?
Still time to run.

134
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,671
What did she say?

135
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,590
Nothing. Um...
Look, what's going on here?

136
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,275
It's Okay. We have two reception rooms
here. There is no problem.

137
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,510
There. Ya happy now, Barbie?

138
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,229
- What does she mean by that?
- Leave it, Barbie. Leave it, Sophie.

139
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:46,232
- She's not worth it.
- Hey, there's no need to get personal.

140
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:49,710
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
all is under control.

141
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,349
Could the Butlers please go with Michael
and take to the left?

142
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:55,556
The Okinwes follow me to the right.

143
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:58,154
- Thank you.
- I didn't even understand that.

144
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:00,959
- This way.
- Come on, everyone! This way!

145
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,918
Cheerio! Congratulations.

146
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,591
You are very welcome, sir.

147
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,788
Everything as you request.

148
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:14,431
The main room. This is the dancing room.
And you've got the dining room.

149
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,112
I could murder a coke, Dad.

150
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,557
- I'll get you one, OK?
- Thanks.

151
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,757
Hey, could you stop calling him that?
He's not your dad.

152
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:30,070
He is now.
I was at the wedding, remember?

153
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,357
Seen anyone for me?

154
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,032
Hey, he's cute.

155
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,991
- Hey.
- How are you? Are you well?

156
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:46,479
Good, thanks. How are you?

157
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:50,155
Don't worry, love. Fate'll send you
someone when you least expect it.

158
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:53,755
I've no faith in fate.
It always lets me down.

159
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:54,829
Hey.

160
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,951
Right, what'll youse have?

161
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:02,874
If you'd like to follow me, the wedding
photographs will be taken in the garden.

162
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:06,839
Ah, Jesus. Can we not use the photos
from the last time?

163
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,549
- It's the same people.
- We are doing everything right, Okay?

164
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,313
This is the real wedding.
Forget about the last one.

165
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:15,675
Come on, now, everybody outside.

166
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,751
Follow me, please.

167
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,871
Come this way.

168
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:25,953
Okay, nice and close together.
That's it. That's lovely.

169
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:28,554
Thank you. Nice, happy smiles.

170
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:31,359
Sophie, smile. More.

171
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:34,159
- That's great. And again.
- Is that the best you can do?

172
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,118
Sorry, excuse me, excuse me.
I just... How do I do this?

173
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:37,838
There.

174
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,749
- Is that your shot?
- Yes.

175
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:46,833
- All right.
- That's it. OK, here we go.

176
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,111
One more. Lovely.

177
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,151
Have one of me and Freddie, eh?

178
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,477
You'd better not hurt my daughter again,
do you hear me?

179
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,234
- I wouldn't.
- That's good.

180
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:12,984
Okay.

181
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,437
We'll just have one more.
Yeah, just take one more.

182
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:18,437
Ooh.

183
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,189
I'll be keeping me eye on you,
all right, boy?

184
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:23,269
Yeah.

185
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,954
- Yeah.
- Right, let's go eat.

186
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,391
- See you inside.
- Hey, guys.

187
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,115
See you.

188
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:37,191
Oh, shit.

189
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,958
Yeah, be... Be there in a minute. So...

190
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,039
- That's me da there.
- He's not your da.

191
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,317
- He is. How would you know?
- You're a liar, pants on fire.

192
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:52,675
He is me da. And you were adopted.

193
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,070
Your real parents were axe murderers
who cut off your granny's head.

194
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,720
- No, they're not.
- Go ask if you don't believe me.

195
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,470
Ma!

196
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,639
Ah, champagne, Mary.
James, how are you?

197
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,159
Ah, girls, here you go.

198
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,232
No, thanks, missus.
We need something a bit stronger.

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,036
There you are. What are youse having?

200
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:18,350
Two double vodkas and slimline,
please, Da.

201
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,311
Where's the kids?

202
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,597
Hmm? I thought you had them.

203
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,834
Oh, Jesus. Can you
not watch them for five minutes?

204
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,717
I thought she had them.

205
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,030
Keep 'em coming, son.

206
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,477
Marriage is a wonderful thing,
eh, Dessie? A wonderful thing.

207
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,035
- This way.
- All right.

208
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,514
- Here?
- Yeah.

209
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,470
Okay.

210
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,554
Are you Okay, guys? Smile.

211
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,877
See? Told you. All fine. Fifty bucks.

212
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,149
You're putting on
a very good show, Molly.

213
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,909
Thanks.

214
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,918
- What does he mean, show?
- Look. The photographer.

215
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,957
Let me handle this guy. He's a nutter.

216
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,190
Hey, you.
You're ruining our photos.

217
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,191
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,431
Are you all right?
You don't look so well.

219
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,158
It's just... It's my back.

220
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:47,390
Two minutes with my father-in-law
and it goes.

221
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,436
- Let's have a look.
- No, no! I don't...

222
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:51,988
- I don't need your help. I can manage.
- OK.

223
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:53,752
No. Not... Not the suit!

224
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,152
- Oh! It's rented.
- You're a bit highly strung.

225
00:16:58,152 --> 00:17:02,358
Does anyone ever tell you that?
Let me just... I saw this on TV once.

226
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,069
Give me that.

227
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,679
Hey, you! Leave her alone!

228
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,312
Hey, you! Leave her alone!

229
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,080
- I can explain.
- Leave her alone. Just stay away.

230
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,355
Look what you've done.
Go away!

231
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,558
Hey!

232
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:38,915
I will... I will kill you.

233
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,711
You just... just leave her.

234
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,635
It's all right.
I'll be all right in a minute.

235
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,271
Who is she?

236
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Who?

237
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,637
Oh! I... I don't know.
Some crazy person.

238
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:16,190
Really? Your hands were all over her.

239
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,271
My hands were...

240
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,193
Look...

241
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,355
I thought we talked about this.
Hey? Didn't we? Hmm?

242
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:31,637
Counsellor said you were to try to
stop seeing things that weren't there.

243
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:33,358
Didn't he?

244
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,953
- He did.
- He did.

245
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:37,713
You said you were gonna try
and work on that, didn't you?

246
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:41,236
I did. I am.

247
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:43,993
- So you don't know her?
- No, I don't know her.

248
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:46,435
And I don't want to, either.

249
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,431
Fine.

250
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,911
- You eating that?
- No, go on.

251
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,511
Thanks very much.

252
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,592
- You better behave yourself tonight.
- Or what?

253
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:20,592
Or else. I'm watching you.

254
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,715
Yeah.

255
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,555
Is she his sister?

256
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,231
I don't know.

257
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,831
Mmm! This is fantastic.

258
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,951
I'm not eating that.

259
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,111
- Can I go play?
- Go on.

260
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,714
Don't go far.

261
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:47,519
I consider it a great privilege

262
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,115
to have been given
a second bite of this cherry.

263
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:52,553
Jesus. Here we go.

264
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:56,076
Sophie, you've made me a very happy man

265
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:59,835
and I hope I can make you as happy,
'cause no one deserves it more.

266
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,879
They look very heavy.
You must be very strong.

267
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,231
What time do you get off?

268
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,799
- Jesus!
- My nose!

269
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,476
You fool. Why don't you look
where you're going? Lazy Irish.

270
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,914
Pompous...

271
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,710
Where's me money?

272
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,429
If there are no problems, you will get
your money at the end of the evening.

273
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:39,956
- Okay?
- Nothing's gonna happen now.

274
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:43,316
This isn't America, you know.
We're not like that here.

275
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:45,277
That's what you think.

276
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,909
Immigration watch everything,
all the time.

277
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:52,675
They could be here, with us, right now.

278
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,349
Thank you.

279
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:01,592
And, finally, a big thank you
to Father Tom for such a lovely service.

280
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:02,954
It was lovely, wasn't it?

281
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:04,632
So, ladies and gentlemen,

282
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:07,473
if you'd like to join me
and toast the bride and groom.

283
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:08,834
Shall we, everyone?

284
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,957
- Sophie and Freddie.
- Sophie and Freddie.

285
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,872
- You lost?
- I'm starving.

286
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:31,555
- Didn't your mother feed you?
- No, I have to look after myself.

287
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,116
- Why am I not shocked?
- Yeah, and she beats me up, too.

288
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:38,031
What? She...

289
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:41,954
Here, come on.
Let me get you something to eat. Um...

290
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:43,917
- Do you like chicken?
- I love all of this.

291
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,872
Do you have a light?

292
00:21:56,872 --> 00:21:58,951
Oh, it's you.

293
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,031
- She doesn't really beat you, does she?
- Only when she's really drunk.

294
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,792
Me mother's kind of different.

295
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,519
You wouldn't believe
some of the things she does.

296
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,956
Nothing she does would surprise me.

297
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:25,158
You know, I am gonna go
and give her a piece of my mind.

298
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:29,677
No! It'll only make her mad,
and then she'll beat me even more.

299
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,831
How's yours? Your wedding?

300
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:40,595
This is our second time around,
second time marrying each other.

301
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:43,911
You're kidding?
You went through all of this twice?

302
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:44,911
Yep.

303
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,313
There were some problems the first time.

304
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:51,516
I don't want to talk about it.

305
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,229
There was a nervous breakdown.
Six months in therapy.

306
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,198
Doctors, medication.

307
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,831
More medication.

308
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,960
Sorry.

309
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,916
- Things are Okay now?
- Oh, yeah. I'm lucky.

310
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,796
The way I see it, I have someone
who wants to marry me two times,

311
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:23,792
and that's something, isn't it?

312
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,591
Do you have somebody like that?

313
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,629
No.

314
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,353
Well, anyway... I'd better...

315
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,150
- See you.
- Nice talking to you.

316
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,674
Good luck, not that you need it...

317
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,635
...or anything.

318
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,031
See you, Freddie.

319
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,999
- There you are. Where'd you get to?
- Oh. I've got a thumping headache.

320
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:01,640
Would you...
I've some tablets in my room.

321
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,157
- Stay there. Take it easy.
- Okay.

322
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:05,673
I'll be right back.

323
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,074
You.

324
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:11,799
- Large whisky, lots of ice.
- No problem.

325
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,315
I'm sorry about earlier, with the...

326
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:51,233
- Oh.
- There's nothing broken, I hope?

327
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:53,151
I'll survive.

328
00:24:53,151 --> 00:24:55,754
Good, good.

329
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,718
- How's your stress?
- What stress?

330
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,833
- I'm not stressed.
- Okay.

331
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,070
- How's your back holding up?
- It's fine.

332
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,119
Ooh! I'm not gonna hurt you.
You're so uptight.

333
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,191
- I'm not uptight.
- No, you're not.

334
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:21,078
- Just please stop doing that.
- Oh, you do need help.

335
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:25,790
I do not... I do not need help. You're
the one... Please stop doing that.

336
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,950
- Is it bothering you?
- It's bothering me.

337
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,237
Loosen up. You'll end up sick
if you keep it all bottled up.

338
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,268
- Sorry. What?
- It's my contact lens.

339
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,430
- Oh, it's gone behind my eye.
- Hold still.

340
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,397
- Get off.
- Let me see.

341
00:25:39,397 --> 00:25:41,675
Stop it. Are you crazy?

342
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:44,194
- Are you all right?
- You've blinded me, actually.

343
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,032
- You're some tulip.
- Yeah.

344
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:48,350
But at least I don't beat my kids
or starve them.

345
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,590
What?

346
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,752
Oh! I see it, I see it. Don't move.

347
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,714
Come on.

348
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,631
My nose!

349
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,351
Taxi!

350
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,755
- Sorry.
- Okay.

351
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:41,505
Okay?

352
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,476
Come on. I'll help you up.

353
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:47,916
- There we are. You all right?
- Yeah.

354
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:50,468
Well, I suppose I should say thank you.

355
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:51,629
There's no need.

356
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:53,836
Listen, I think
it would be best and safest..

357
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:56,559
if you would stay away from me
for the rest of the evening.

358
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,200
That's fine with me, and likewise.

359
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,872
Hey! Go on, Wilson!

360
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,876
- Two cokes, mister.
- Get out of here, kid. We're busy.

361
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:40,076
You don't look busy.

362
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,151
Get out of here before I...

363
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,949
Dad and Mum look good together,
don't they?

364
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,431
Yeah.

365
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,949
Your mum did explain all this to you,
didn't she?

366
00:27:56,949 --> 00:28:00,396
Yeah. She said it wouldn't be
the usual type of marriage,

367
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,630
and that Wilson
wouldn't be living with us,

368
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,759
which is good 'cause he seems to bring
his sister everywhere, doesn't he?

369
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,117
- And you understand all that?
- Yeah, course I do.

370
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:23,516
I'm really sorry.

371
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,075
Did you have to hold her so tight, huh?

372
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,718
I wasn't!

373
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,675
Here, what would happen
if I poured this on that synthesiser?

374
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:55,558
- Don't. I'm warning you.
- Go on.

375
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:57,437
- Don't.
- Hey.

376
00:28:57,437 --> 00:29:00,080
Could you keep them knackers
away from us, love?

377
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,675
- Hey, watch it. They're my knackers.
- Of course they are.

378
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,479
Bitch. Come on, youse. Bed.

379
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,674
- I can't find her.
- Really?

380
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:12,751
- No.
- That's strange.

381
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,991
Well, she must be around somewhere.

382
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,470
Geraldine, have you seen
Sophie anywhere?

383
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,028
- No.
- Well, would you help me find her?

384
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,235
No.

385
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,270
Oh, Je...

386
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,077
I'm, um... sorry.

387
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,713
That is absolutely no problem.

388
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,750
- Pythagoras.
- Yeah, yeah.

389
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,753
You can see the moon, can't you?
And it's round, isn't it?

390
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,110
Dessie, say good night to your kids.

391
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,591
Ah, ah, there you are, lads. OK, yeah.
Now, sweet dreams, huh? Huh?

392
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,715
Sorry to disturb you.

393
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:22,236
Don't be worrying, now.
Everything's under control.

394
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:26,108
- You carry on.
- Hey... OK.

395
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,631
- Thanks a million.
- No problem.

396
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,835
Why get out of bed
if there isn't any jobs.

397
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,875
All right, love.
Jeez, you're really filling that dress.

398
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,358
What the...?

399
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,514
Tommy, help! Come over now.

400
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,668
There's your man again.

401
00:31:32,668 --> 00:31:35,672
- He's not bad-looking.
- Believe me, he's not for you.

402
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,831
Hold on.

403
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,516
Can I help you?

404
00:31:46,516 --> 00:31:49,398
- Have you seen my wife?
- Mislaid her, have you?

405
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:52,313
- That's very careless.
- Just answer the question.

406
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:56,393
We had a long chat, actually.
She told me you two got married twice.

407
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:59,233
What are you,
some kind of wedding addict?

408
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:01,311
Stop.

409
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,873
- Where'd you see her?
- Outside in the garden.

410
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,919
- Did you do something to her?
- Why would you say that?

411
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,433
Sorry.

412
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,153
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

413
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:20,231
Thanks.

414
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,394
Do you know how long I dieted
to get into this dress?

415
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,918
- Five months.
- You OK, love?

416
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,394
Oh, I'm fine.

417
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:49,790
I just left my husband,
and do you know what? I feel great.

418
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,598
- Men are pigs.
- Yeah.

419
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:53,671
Men are pigs.

420
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,318
Do not get married.

421
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:59,198
- Any of you married?
- No.

422
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,474
- Good.
- What you gonna do now?

423
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:07,597
She's gonna come out with us,
that's what she's gonna do.

424
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:10,194
- I am?
- Yeah.

425
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,630
What are you doing?

426
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,278
Molly.

427
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:28,874
Why are you kissing her?
I thought she was your sister.

428
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,951
My sister?

429
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,229
This is Emily, my girlfriend.

430
00:33:36,229 --> 00:33:39,471
Your girlfriend?
But you're married to my mother.

431
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:42,757
- You shouldn't be doing that with her.
- Didn't your mother tell you?

432
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:43,955
Tell me what?

433
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:48,238
We hired your mother for the day,
and for a lot of money.

434
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:50,151
What do you mean? Hired for what?

435
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,875
- Your mother didn't explain it to you?
- No, she didn't.

436
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,029
Molly.

437
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,880
Molly!

438
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,675
We will talk about this later.

439
00:34:05,675 --> 00:34:07,478
He paid you.
Are you some kind of a hooker?

440
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,074
- Don't you talk to me like that.
- It's the truth.

441
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:12,754
He was being deported
and we needed the money.

442
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:16,833
I told you it wasn't a proper wedding,
that we wouldn't be living together.

443
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:20,390
- So it's all a joke, the whole thing.
- No, Molly. This is very serious.

444
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,074
Don't you go messing this up.
I'm doing this for us.

445
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:27,438
How is this for me? You couldn't even
get me a dad for one day, could you?

446
00:34:27,438 --> 00:34:30,159
- I hate you!
- Molly.

447
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,991
Molly!

448
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,908
- Is everything Okay?
- Yep, nothing to worry about.

449
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,635
Those men over there.
I don't think they're waiters.

450
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:13,235
We have to all act normal.

451
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,790
OK.

452
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,631
It's a load of bollocks, isn't it?

453
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,831
I kind of like it.

454
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,675
Hey...

455
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,515
- Is there any sign?
- No.

456
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,354
- What's up?
- My daughter has gone missing.

457
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:01,589
Good Lord.

458
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:05,514
Look, let's, uh... Let's keep this
between ourselves for the moment.

459
00:36:05,514 --> 00:36:07,591
What's going on?

460
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:09,636
Sophie's gone AWOL.

461
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:12,280
Aw, that's a shame.

462
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,435
- You're looking for the bride?
- Yes.

463
00:36:15,435 --> 00:36:18,239
- She's left in an ambulance.
- My God. Is she hurt?

464
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,880
No, no, no, no.
The ambulance was not for her.

465
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,192
- When did she go?
- I would say... 40 minutes ago.

466
00:36:25,192 --> 00:36:27,714
Forty minutes ago!
Why didn't you say something?

467
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,431
No one asked me.

468
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,509
If this has anything to do with you...

469
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,357
I'll try calling her.
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

470
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,668
Sorry.

471
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,433
- Hello?
- Sophie. Where the hell are you?

472
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:02,637
<i>You. I saw you with her.</i>

473
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,518
- Who?
- That slapper in the wedding dress.

474
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:10,037
- I saw you snogging her in the lift.
- What? I didn't.

475
00:37:10,037 --> 00:37:13,556
<i>- Amn't I good enough for you?
- Of course you are, Sophie.</i>

476
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:16,871
- You mean everything to me.
- You've a funny way of showing it.

477
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,479
You're a dog, Freddie Butler, a...

478
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,357
- Scumbag.
- A scumbag.

479
00:37:22,357 --> 00:37:24,192
- A dirty louser.
- A dirty louser.

480
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:25,269
Good one.

481
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,159
Look, Sophie, uh... I love you, OK?

482
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,516
You know that. So just...
Just come back. Could you do that?

483
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:36,034
- Let me talk to her.
- Get off. Get off!

484
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:38,554
- Don't tell me to get off.
- No, I didn't mean you.

485
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:39,755
I didn't mean you.

486
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,831
Look, Sophie, where are you?

487
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:49,438
<i>- Everybody's worried about you.
- I'm out, with friends.</i>

488
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:51,476
And I don't care
if I ever see you again!

489
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:53,755
- Sophie.
- Never ever!

490
00:37:53,755 --> 00:37:56,115
<i>Sophie...</i>

491
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,715
<i>Sophie?</i>

492
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:01,791
Sophie...

493
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,711
Sophie?

494
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,958
- She hung up.
- Well, call her back!

495
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,436
- Want me to find her?
- I don't know where she's gone.

496
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,914
I'm not adopted. Me ma says she gave
birth to me and that it hurt like hell.

497
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:26,070
So that makes you a big fat liar.

498
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,913
- What are you doing with the balloon?
- None of your business.

499
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:30,991
- Get lost, will you?
- Fine.

500
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,950
Well done, love. You told him!

501
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,395
Look at me.

502
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,391
It's my wedding day.

503
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,470
Have another drink, love.

504
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,393
Hey, young fella.
Four tequilas over here, please.

505
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,913
- Sure, love.
- Aw.

506
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,476
She's, uh... She's not answering.

507
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:07,711
- Where is she?
- She didn't say. Sounded like a pub.

508
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:11,475
- Is she all right?
- She didn't sound like herself.

509
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,072
Excuse me, everybody. I'd like to say
thank you very much for coming, and...

510
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,198
You remember our little talk, Freddie?

511
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,192
I don't know what's going on,
but I will fix it.

512
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,271
You better.

513
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,399
- I'm... I'm so, so sorry.
- It's not your fault.

514
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,516
Youse had better come down to our room.

515
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:18,068
No, we don't want to be of any trouble.

516
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:21,470
It's no trouble.
There's plenty of space.

517
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,199
And it could do
with a bit of livening up in there.

518
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,548
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

519
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,638
<i>Oh, no. C'est pas possible.</i>

520
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,713
What happened here?
I... I don't understand.

521
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:40,519
Someone must have start a fire.

522
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,476
Come here! Come here!

523
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,390
Help yourself to drinks. The bride's
father is paying. He won't mind.

524
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,311
Thank you.

525
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:01,712
- What's going on here?
- They needed shelter from the storm.

526
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,157
What storm?

527
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,751
- Hey. I need to talk to you.
- Can't now. Busy.

528
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,193
- Come back here!
- Stop!

529
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,919
I'm gonna kill you! No!

530
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,871
- I need you to do something for me.
- It'll have to wait.

531
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,873
Molly.

532
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,236
You go that way and I'll go this way.

533
00:41:49,236 --> 00:41:52,596
- And watch out. She bites.
- I don't have time for this.

534
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:55,990
If you want me to do something for you,
then you do this for me.

535
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,359
- Molly!
- I've had enough of this.

536
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,397
- You've ruined my wedding.
- Me?

537
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:08,675
- Yeah.
- You're crazy.

538
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:11,832
And, anyway, it didn't need anyone
to mess it up for you.

539
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:14,514
What do you mean?
Why'd you say something like that?

540
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:16,955
Easy. I didn't mean it.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

541
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:19,998
I suppose you have
the perfect relationship, is that it?

542
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,391
That's right.

543
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,477
Love at first sight, but you wouldn't
know anything about that

544
00:42:29,477 --> 00:42:32,632
because you have to do everything twice
before you get it right.

545
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:34,392
- Molly!
- Okay, that's enough.

546
00:42:34,392 --> 00:42:39,395
That's enough. I need you...
I need you to talk to my wife.

547
00:42:39,395 --> 00:42:41,948
Your wife? Why?

548
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,155
- I need you to tell her that we're...
- What?

549
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:52,473
You and me, we're not... we're not...
We're not having an affair.

550
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:55,836
You're both crazy.
When did they let you out?

551
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:57,876
- She has a little jealousy problem.
- Little?

552
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,757
There's an elephant in the room.

553
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:03,116
- You have to do this.
- No, I don't. Goodbye.

554
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,076
I'm not surprised your daughter ran off,
the way you treat her.

555
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,311
What's she been saying to you?

556
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,394
- Look, your family is your business.
- Yeah.

557
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,193
Look, my marriage
means everything to me.

558
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,554
Really? Great.

559
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,951
Molly?

560
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,351
Molly! Molly, get down here now!

561
00:43:53,351 --> 00:43:54,873
No.

562
00:43:54,873 --> 00:43:57,633
- You do as you're told, young lady.
- I won't.

563
00:43:57,633 --> 00:44:01,599
- I'll get her.
- Be careful.

564
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,350
Molly, you're in deep, deep trouble
when I get my hands on you.

565
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,151
- Come on, Molly.
- No.

566
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,993
I'm not talking to her ever again.

567
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:20,551
Whatever the problem is, it's not
gonna be solved by running away.

568
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,629
- Do it for me, eh?
- It'll cost you.

569
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,191
How much?

570
00:44:26,191 --> 00:44:28,077
- Fifty quid.
- What?

571
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,990
OK.

572
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,798
OK. Done. Now, come on.

573
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,393
Come on.

574
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,149
Whoa!

575
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:46,392
Okay, Okay.

576
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,240
- Put your foot there.
- Have you got her?

577
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,031
What the hell were you doing up there?
Anything could have happened to you.

578
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,114
Why do you do this to me?
Am I such a bad mother?

579
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:07,193
You're a useless mother. I'd rather be
adopted than spend another day with you.

580
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:09,589
- How can you say that to me?
- 'Cause it's true!

581
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,356
What am I gonna do with her?

582
00:45:18,356 --> 00:45:21,432
She's a great kid.
You should be very proud.

583
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,151
But I suppose a bit of structure
in her life would be a good thing.

584
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,559
Okay. If you want me to talk to your wife,
let's do it now before I change my mind.

585
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,154
- Really?
- I guess I owe you that much.

586
00:45:34,154 --> 00:45:36,231
That's great. Thank you.

587
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,551
Can I move in with you?

588
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:52,755
No.

589
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,991
How are you, love?

590
00:45:58,991 --> 00:46:00,638
I'm not so good, actually.

591
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,991
That's it. You!

592
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,035
Get off. Did you hear me?

593
00:46:14,035 --> 00:46:16,475
I said get off!

594
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,392
You're crap.
Don't call us, we'll call you.

595
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,993
That stupid bitch Sophie picked her.

596
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,792
You lot, are youse any good?

597
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:37,271
Go on. Show us what you're made of.

598
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,358
Nice eyes. Green.

599
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,397
Just tell her what happened
and then give the phone back to me.

600
00:47:23,397 --> 00:47:25,391
- Okay?
- Okay. Great.

601
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,073
What?

602
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,029
Hello?

603
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,554
<i>- Sophie? You're there. It's Freddie.
- Yeah.</i>

604
00:47:46,554 --> 00:47:48,995
Look, I got the woman
you saw me with here.

605
00:47:48,995 --> 00:47:51,435
I'm gonna put her on,
and she's gonna explain everything,

606
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,159
'cause it's all just been
a big mix-up, OK?

607
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:56,470
- Uh-huh.
- OK.

608
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,111
Yeah.

609
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:06,950
- Hello, Sophie?
- You bleedin' slapper.

610
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,395
<i>- What?
- You heard me, you bitch.</i>

611
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:13,678
- You've some bloody cheek.
- Watch it, you fat cow.

612
00:48:13,678 --> 00:48:16,797
Don't you call me fat!
Nobody calls me fat!

613
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:19,599
- The last person needed a nose job.
- Give that to me.

614
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,310
Bring it on, lady. I'm waiting.
Come on! Come on!

615
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,119
- Give me that.
- She's... She's dead.

616
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,077
Shh! Darling, it's me.

617
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:31,628
And you! You should have
your balls cut off.

618
00:48:31,628 --> 00:48:34,075
<i>- On her wedding day an' all.
- Sophie?</i>

619
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,113
<i>- Yeah.
- You're not Sophie.</i>

620
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,030
Who's this?
What have you done with Sophie?

621
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,112
That was your husband, again,
and his lady friend.

622
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,353
Nightclub anyone?

623
00:48:54,353 --> 00:48:55,953
Whoo!

624
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,191
- What are you doing now?
- Calling the police.

625
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:02,793
<i>- Why?
- Garda.</i>

626
00:49:02,793 --> 00:49:05,189
- I'd like to report a missing person.
- Right.

627
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:09,239
It's my wife, she's wearing
a wedding dress and she's in a pub.

628
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,039
- Missing in a pub?
- That's right, yeah.

629
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:15,669
She should be here with me, on
her wedding day, at the Napoleon Hotel.

630
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:18,354
<i>- What was the lady's name?
- Sophie. Sophie Maguire.</i>

631
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:21,591
And what was she wearing
the last time you saw her?

632
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,796
<i>- I just told you. A wedding dress.
- Colour?</i>

633
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:27,190
- White. It was fucking white.
- I think it was cream.

634
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,349
- What?
- It's cream.

635
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:30,351
- It's cream, cream.
- Ivory.

636
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:33,830
- Ivory. It's an ivory wedding dress.
- Right, right.

637
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,232
Well, leave it with us, sir,
and we'll see what we can do.

638
00:49:38,232 --> 00:49:41,198
- Thanks for your call.
- You're not gonna do anything, are you?

639
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,629
- We're not.
- Right.

640
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,990
What were they saying?
What did they say?

641
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,470
I can't believe this is
happening to me. I can't.

642
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,350
Is there anything I can do?

643
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,630
No. Please, no.

644
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,280
No, thanks. This is...
This is all your fault.

645
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,634
- Me?
- Yeah.

646
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,632
Hey, sunshine,
I was the one doing you a favour.

647
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,508
- A favour?
- Yeah.

648
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,835
If my baby doesn't turn up soon,
Freddie, you're dead, d'you hear? Dead.

649
00:50:16,835 --> 00:50:18,672
- Hey...
- And you...

650
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,878
I don't know who you are,
but I'm watching you.

651
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,872
Freddie. Freddie.

652
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,079
Freddie, wake up. Wake up. Freddie.

653
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,118
I think it's time we had a word
with the happy husband.

654
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,471
Hello, Wilson.

655
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,193
- Do I know you?
- Oh, you will. You will.

656
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,039
I have every right to stay.

657
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,790
I have. I am married.

658
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:11,838
That's just the problem.
We don't believe this marriage.

659
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:14,718
Your wife isn't exactly
Snow White, is she?

660
00:51:14,718 --> 00:51:17,951
We think it's all a show,
put on to stop you being deported.

661
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:20,270
But when we find out, and we will,

662
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,749
you're gonna be on the first plane
back to Bongo Bongo.

663
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,831
- Bongo Bongo?
- Oh, yes.

664
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,598
I don't know what you're talking about.

665
00:51:28,598 --> 00:51:31,558
Don't you? Where did you
first meet Maura O'Reilly?

666
00:51:31,558 --> 00:51:33,915
- In a pub.
- And when was that?

667
00:51:33,915 --> 00:51:36,468
- About a year ago.
- Short romance, then, was it?

668
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,711
- Like a bolt of lightning?
- That's right. Love at first sight.

669
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:42,837
- She's the perfect woman for me.
- Aw!

670
00:51:42,837 --> 00:51:47,277
What is the problem, huh?
We got married in a church.

671
00:51:47,277 --> 00:51:51,512
Now, that was clever of you, I'll give
you that, but not clever enough.

672
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:54,398
- What's her favourite colour?
- Black.

673
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:56,948
- Animal?
- She likes all kinds of animals.

674
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,793
- Song?
- She'll dance to anything.

675
00:51:59,793 --> 00:52:01,757
- Film?
- Musicals.

676
00:52:01,757 --> 00:52:06,550
- What height is she?
- About this high.

677
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,349
Where did you first propose to Maura?

678
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:13,477
Stephen's Green, near a pond.

679
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,399
- There were swans.
- So romantic.

680
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,711
Will you stop interrupting
when I'm trying to do an interrogation?

681
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:24,119
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

682
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,318
Great band, aren't they?
Really... jamming.

683
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:36,394
Yes, very good.
Father... may I ask you a question?

684
00:52:36,394 --> 00:52:37,644
Sure.

685
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,433
Would it be a sin
if a man paid a woman to marry him?

686
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:49,637
Paid? Why would somebody want do that?

687
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,028
- Do you know somebody who's done this?
- Maybe.

688
00:52:55,028 --> 00:52:58,829
Oh, not Wilson.
Please tell me not Wilson.

689
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:01,115
- Is it a sin?
- Is it a sin?

690
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,075
Marriage is a holy sacrament
made in front of God,

691
00:53:05,075 --> 00:53:07,549
performed by a servant of God.

692
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,314
- Me.
- So is it a sin?

693
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,391
Of course it's a sin.

694
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,999
This is very, very bad. I'm in on this.

695
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,872
- Where is he?
- No, you mustn't tell anybody, Father.

696
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,431
- Come on. Freddie.
- Maura.

697
00:53:27,431 --> 00:53:30,159
I need to talk to you
about something very seriously.

698
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:32,117
- OK.
- Who is that man?

699
00:53:32,117 --> 00:53:35,192
- Here, grab his other arm.
- Has he had too much to drink?

700
00:53:35,192 --> 00:53:37,669
He needs to lie down.
Too much champagne.

701
00:53:37,669 --> 00:53:39,751
Come on, young fella. Whoa!

702
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,118
- Thanks.
- Where to?

703
00:53:43,118 --> 00:53:46,476
- Over there.
- Believe me, everything is in order.

704
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:48,551
Quick, in here. In here.

705
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,149
We'll need to ask your so-called wife
a few questions.

706
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,629
Maura, what is going on?

707
00:53:57,629 --> 00:54:00,518
Shh! The police are after me.

708
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,869
You can ask her whatever you want.
In fact, I'll go and find her myself.

709
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,393
- Whoa.
- Dad.

710
00:54:08,393 --> 00:54:11,597
Everybody's looking for you.
Come on back.

711
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,037
Go on.

712
00:54:15,037 --> 00:54:18,237
And don't go disappearing.
We're not finished with you.

713
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,671
This is a very bad thing
you've done, Maura.

714
00:54:32,512 --> 00:54:34,556
It's a sin, you know. A biggie.

715
00:54:34,556 --> 00:54:37,234
I'll just have to live with it, Father.
Thanks.

716
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,194
Well, I can't abide by...

717
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,269
- Hello?
- Go talk to them.

718
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:46,555
- What? Why me?
- I'm not a good liar.

719
00:54:46,555 --> 00:54:49,200
And you think I am?

720
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,714
- Oh!
- Ah, Father. The very man.

721
00:54:53,714 --> 00:54:56,712
- There it is.
- Immigration.

722
00:54:56,712 --> 00:54:58,791
Very nice. Good evening.

723
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,831
Did you notice anything suspicious
about the wedding today, Father?

724
00:55:05,831 --> 00:55:08,957
Suspicious? No, no, nothing.

725
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:13,397
So you've no doubts
about the bona fides of the union?

726
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:16,233
No, no, none.

727
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,111
So it all seemed above board
to you, then, did it?

728
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:23,668
Above board to me, yeah.

729
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,795
You would tell us, wouldn't you, Father?

730
00:55:26,795 --> 00:55:31,670
- Man of the cloth.
- Yeah. Sorry about that, Father.

731
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,031
- Are you happy now?
- No, not until we talk to the bride.

732
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,119
What? Do you wanna go home?

733
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,792
- Yes.
- Well, you can't.

734
00:55:55,792 --> 00:55:58,189
Now, come on. Let's find her.

735
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,479
It's not what you think.
The police are after me.

736
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,354
Wait. Freddie, wait.

737
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,513
Hey.

738
00:56:21,513 --> 00:56:25,718
Hey. I'm... I'm really sorry
about your wife.

739
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,598
But if... if there's anything
I can do, then...

740
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:39,358
Look, I know you probably mean well...

741
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,716
But... Jesus.

742
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,709
I know you
probably mean well,

743
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:54,511
but every time you try to help out,
things only end up getting worse.

744
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:00,276
So, please, can you just...

745
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,429
Clear off?

746
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,431
Yeah.

747
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,391
Would you?

748
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,116
- No offence.
- None taken.

749
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,790
What are you doing?
I told you to behave.

750
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,189
Can you mind your own business, please?

751
00:57:58,189 --> 00:58:01,875
My business? Don't be annoying me now.
Get back downstairs.

752
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,431
No, I won't. You've been on my back
since I'm 16 and I'm sick of it.

753
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,955
Have you seen yourself lately, Niamh?

754
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,837
You'd want to have a good look

755
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:18,072
because you're turning
into a bitter old battleaxe.

756
00:58:18,072 --> 00:58:22,438
Now, why don't you go back to
your boring life and your boring husband

757
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:26,638
and leave me alone?
Come on, Arthur.

758
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,790
Sorry. Can I just get by you there?

759
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,114
I'm gonna be left on the shelf
like she said.

760
00:58:49,114 --> 00:58:50,599
Who said?

761
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,477
Get out.

762
00:58:52,477 --> 00:58:54,437
My mother.

763
00:58:54,437 --> 00:58:59,640
She said... that I should take
the second chance with Freddie...

764
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,711
...'cause I might not get another offer.

765
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,830
- Mothers!
- Jesus. Take it easy, Bridie.

766
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,434
You have got to
think of yourself now, love.

767
00:59:11,434 --> 00:59:13,511
Here.

768
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,911
- There you are, love.
- Thanks.

769
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:44,597
You... What do you think you're doing?
You've managed to ruin everything.

770
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,200
- What did I do?
- You need to speak to the detectives.

771
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,635
- Make them believe.
- Oh, no.

772
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,516
I said I'd marry you, but that's all.

773
00:59:53,516 --> 00:59:57,195
Lying to the police
was not part of the deal.

774
00:59:57,195 --> 00:59:59,316
But you have to. It's the only way.

775
00:59:59,316 --> 01:00:02,073
Look, I could get into
lots of trouble doing this.

776
01:00:02,073 --> 01:00:04,799
Who would look after Molly
if they charged me? I'm all she has.

777
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,190
They're gonna throw me
out of the country. Don't you care?

778
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,554
Of course I care. I just...
I just can't. I'm sorry.

779
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,753
You don't care. You don't.

780
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:23,469
Of all the girls in this country,
why the hell did I have to meet you?

781
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,471
I was a good choice.

782
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,351
I need to get my money now.

783
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,271
I did my part.

784
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,109
What's wrong?

785
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,993
Psst!
We're leaving.

786
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,429
Yes.

787
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,200
Molly.

788
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,515
Right, Wilson, I've had enough of this.

789
01:01:23,515 --> 01:01:26,068
Unless you can produce your wife
in the next five minutes,

790
01:01:26,068 --> 01:01:29,470
you are going
on a very long trip, one way.

791
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,200
- Hey, kid, where's your mother?
- How would I know?

792
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,589
Brilliant.

793
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,189
Hey!

794
01:01:42,189 --> 01:01:44,271
Watch it, cow.

795
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,395
Look! It's Batman.

796
01:01:52,395 --> 01:01:53,115
Ha-ha!

797
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,792
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
Not a superhero any more, are we?

798
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,790
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Don't touch me.

799
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,632
- Please let me help you.
- Fuck off!

800
01:02:08,632 --> 01:02:12,679
It was a mistake.

801
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:15,149
I made a mistake.

802
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,391
How are you, love?

803
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,591
I can't do this anymore.

804
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,551
I'm leaving you.

805
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,316
I want all your stuff gone by tomorrow.

806
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,151
She didn't mean that.

807
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,111
Did she?

808
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,189
It was nice meeting you, Molly.

809
01:03:17,189 --> 01:03:19,999
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

810
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:25,075
There's no point in staying.
I mean... she's not coming back.

811
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:26,912
I've messed it up again.

812
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,229
Mine's a mess too.

813
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,392
No. No, you've got a lovely family.

814
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,238
Your mother's not too bad, really.

815
01:03:40,238 --> 01:03:42,311
And your dad seems like a nice guy.

816
01:03:42,311 --> 01:03:45,392
- It's all a show.
- What is?

817
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:48,916
Their marriage. He paid her to do it
so he could stay here.

818
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,514
Well, that's... That's terrible.

819
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,040
I know. She says she did it
so we could keep our house.

820
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,111
She sure is one woman, your mother.

821
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,960
- Full of surprises.
- Too many.

822
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,670
Maybe she just wants
what's best for you.

823
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,671
You might give her a break, eh?

824
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,994
Take care of yourself, Molly, OK?

825
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:22,870
OK.

826
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,679
- A wedding dress?
- A wedding dress, yeah.

827
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,075
Her name wouldn't be...
Sophie, would it?

828
01:04:47,075 --> 01:04:49,151
What's your name, love?

829
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,351
There you are.

830
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,428
- Molly hates me, doesn't she?
- No.

831
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,109
I mean, why would she?

832
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:21,079
You just dragged her through a fake
wedding to a man you hardly know

833
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:25,870
who isn't gonna be a father to her,
that's all. Why would she hate you?

834
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,317
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

835
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,671
Come on.

836
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:43,073
What on earth...? Sophie!
Oh, thank God!

837
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,917
- Where did you find her?
- We arrested her for assaulting a nun.

838
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:48,149
I want to see Freddie!

839
01:05:48,149 --> 01:05:53,633
Um, look, we'll...
We'll take care of her now. Um...

840
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:56,439
Thank you very much. Thank you.

841
01:05:56,439 --> 01:05:57,999
- Where is he?
- Come on, Sophie.

842
01:05:57,999 --> 01:06:00,674
- I wanna see...
- Come on.

843
01:06:00,674 --> 01:06:04,196
Sophie, come here.
Come on, get up those stairs.

844
01:06:04,196 --> 01:06:07,670
- I wanna see Freddie.
- Come on, Sophie.

845
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,110
Freddie, wait! She's back!
Your wife, she came back!

846
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,911
She came back?

847
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,593
I knew it. I knew she would.

848
01:06:21,593 --> 01:06:25,195
Thank you. Thank you, Molly.
You're a star. Thank you!

849
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,631
Thank you! Ha!

850
01:06:29,631 --> 01:06:33,269
Now, your father will bring
the car round and we'll get you home.

851
01:06:33,269 --> 01:06:35,510
I'm not going anywhere. I just got here.

852
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:39,149
Listen to your mother, princess.
It's for the best.

853
01:06:39,149 --> 01:06:42,073
For the best? For the best?

854
01:06:42,073 --> 01:06:45,630
This is all your fault!
"You'll be left on the shelf, Sophie.

855
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:48,154
Take your chance
while it's still there."

856
01:06:48,154 --> 01:06:52,199
I'm not listening to you
anymore, Mother.

857
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:54,840
Sophie, will you calm down, dear?

858
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,356
- Get out of my way.
- Sophie!

859
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,271
Sophie!

860
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,155
- She came back.
- Who?

861
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,191
Oh, yes, that's great.

862
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,671
I think Niamh is leaving me.

863
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,155
- That's very funny.
- It's not a joke.

864
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,671
Sophie.

865
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,911
No one wants you. Why don't you do
everyone a favour and just disappear?

866
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,555
Hey, let's have both couples
on the dance floor.

867
01:07:41,555 --> 01:07:43,710
Great idea.

868
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,631
- Sophie.
- No!

869
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,630
Thank God you're back.

870
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:58,156
OK. I'll do it.

871
01:07:58,156 --> 01:08:01,391
- Quick, tell me everything.
- Relax. You'll be fine.

872
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:04,631
I gave you my whole life story,
remember?

873
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:07,792
- You didn't read it?
- It was 100 pages.

874
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,794
I'm going to kill you.

875
01:08:10,794 --> 01:08:13,519
It's all just been
one big misunderstanding.

876
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:15,272
It doesn't matter anymore.

877
01:08:15,272 --> 01:08:19,478
Oh, great. Great. I promise,
everything's gonna be all right.

878
01:08:19,478 --> 01:08:21,676
- Where are you going?
- Swap?

879
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,592
I'm Wilson.

880
01:08:31,592 --> 01:08:35,798
And I'm... Whoo!... just the woman
telling you you should watch your wife.

881
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:38,075
Excuse me?

882
01:08:38,075 --> 01:08:40,958
Just keep a close eye on her,
if you know what I mean.

883
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,074
I really, really need to talk to her.

884
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,594
- Can I cut in?

885
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,755
What is she talking about?
What else have you been up to?

886
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:08,752
Maura O'Reilly, I'm gonna
have to ask you a few questions.

887
01:09:08,752 --> 01:09:12,355
- Sure, just a minute.
- I don't wanna dance anymore.

888
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,156
Now. I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to insist.

889
01:09:17,156 --> 01:09:18,593
Keep dancing.

890
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,750
- Hey!
- Hello, everyone.

891
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:28,197
I didn't get to make my speech
earlier on, so here goes.

892
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,631
Shh! Shh!

893
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:37,436
A lot's happened to me today.
I've made some new friends.

894
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,991
I've thought a lot about things.

895
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,830
About my life and what I want from it.

896
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:53,118
Freddie, you are going to make someone

897
01:09:53,118 --> 01:09:57,159
a wonderful husband, really.

898
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,159
But it's not me.

899
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,913
We're not right for each other
and, to be honest,

900
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:07,958
I don't fancy going
through this again with anyone.

901
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:10,873
I mean, to hell with marriage!

902
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:14,191
Why do we do it anyway?
Can anyone tell me?

903
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:23,111
What I'm trying to say is, from now on,

904
01:10:23,111 --> 01:10:27,990
I'm going to do what I want to do,

905
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:32,551
for myself,
not what others tell me to do.

906
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,189
So, Freddie...

907
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,955
...I want another divorce.

908
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,950
Oh, Jesus.

909
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,116
Right, I've had enough of this. Declan.

910
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,116
Where are you going?

911
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:08,555
They can't deport me
if they can't find me.

912
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:11,074
Please...

913
01:11:11,074 --> 01:11:14,869
Tell Emily...
Tell her I'll send her a message.

914
01:11:14,869 --> 01:11:17,520
You, where's the groom?

915
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,750
- No, wait, please.
- Think you can manage that?

916
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,914
That's for Sophie, you scumbag. Yes!

917
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,831
Oh! Oh!

918
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:41,751
- Are you... Are you all right?
- Are they... friends of yours?

919
01:11:41,751 --> 01:11:45,435
I don't know who they are, honestly.
Are you all right?

920
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,191
You can forget about your money.

921
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,708
- But I'll lose my house.
- I don't care.

922
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,553
- I don't care.
- But...

923
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,591
You just lost me nine thousand.

924
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,471
- Did I?
- You did.

925
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,631
I'm sorry.

926
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,037
Um, there's a few hundred there. Um...

927
01:12:32,037 --> 01:12:35,032
And... just take all my credit cards,

928
01:12:35,032 --> 01:12:38,999
'cause... I'm not gonna be
needing them now, so...

929
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,111
And could you give...

930
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,310
Could you give that to Sophie?

931
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,071
Goodbye.

932
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,350
Not so fast, sunshine.

933
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,551
Wilson Okinwe, I'm arresting you under
section 492 of the lmmigration Act.

934
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,790
Now, you have the right
to remain silent,

935
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:14,316
but anything you do say
will be taken down in evidence.

936
01:13:14,316 --> 01:13:16,152
What are you doing to my husband?

937
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,910
Well, if it isn't
the darling bride herself.

938
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,150
I'd like to ask you
a few questions, love.

939
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:25,435
Wilson, who are these gentlemen?

940
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:28,273
- Stay.
- What's this about?

941
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:30,351
This way, please.

942
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,637
Wilson, don't be going away... please.

943
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,236
25th of June.
Detective Norman Ginty interrogating.

944
01:13:57,236 --> 01:13:59,595
Hi, Norman.

945
01:13:59,595 --> 01:14:01,318
Less of that, now, missus.

946
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,510
So... you like the black fellas, eh?

947
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:09,115
I really don't think
that's an appropriate question.

948
01:14:09,115 --> 01:14:11,589
- Where's Wilson from?
- That's easy.

949
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,954
- Africa.
- Whereabouts precisely?

950
01:14:16,954 --> 01:14:19,235
Um...

951
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:22,357
Hey.

952
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,192
And where do you think you're going?

953
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:26,953
I need me ma. I'm only nine, you know.

954
01:14:26,953 --> 01:14:30,350
Go on. You can stay
as long as you don't say a word, Okay?

955
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,198
Good girl. You were saying?

956
01:14:34,198 --> 01:14:35,918
Uh... Um...

957
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,837
Sounds like...

958
01:14:38,837 --> 01:14:41,150
low... low...

959
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,236
Loko. Loko. Loko.

960
01:14:45,236 --> 01:14:50,189
Correct. Listen, kid, there's no moving
either, Okay? No moving, no talking.

961
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:52,157
- Have you got that?
- OK.

962
01:14:52,157 --> 01:14:55,835
Good girl. How many brothers and sisters
does he have?

963
01:14:55,835 --> 01:14:58,229
Oh... Um...

964
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,558
- You're sweating, Mrs Okinwe.
- It's all the dancing.

965
01:15:04,558 --> 01:15:06,392
Um...

966
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,833
Two sis... brothers.

967
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:14,276
One sister.

968
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,873
- Correct.
- I know.

969
01:15:15,873 --> 01:15:18,110
Listen, kid, I'm not joking.

970
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:23,513
If you so much as twitch, I'm sending
you to jail. Have you got that?

971
01:15:23,513 --> 01:15:24,794
Last chance.

972
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,071
What's his mother's name?

973
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,850
Um...

974
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,996
- I can't say it.
- Oh, can't you?

975
01:15:38,996 --> 01:15:41,833
- I mean, I can't pronounce it.
- Oh, that's rubbish.

976
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,114
I just call her Ma.

977
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,959
- Where did he propose?
- Stephen's Green.

978
01:15:48,959 --> 01:15:52,316
That's right, he did.

979
01:15:52,316 --> 01:15:53,719
Gorgeous day.

980
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,118
You're sweating, detective.

981
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,317
Anything else? 'Cause if there isn't,
I'd like to get back to my wedding.

982
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:06,073
Thanks. Come on.

983
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,712
Wait a minute.
Where do you think you're going?

984
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,639
There you are, love. Oh!

985
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,955
See you in a minute.
I'll just get the bedroom ready.

986
01:16:28,955 --> 01:16:31,600
Oh, come on.
It's all a scam. Admit it.

987
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,955
Oh, God.

988
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,230
Do you think we could borrow
those handcuffs? We'll give them back.

989
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,355
Oh.

990
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,068
Thanks.

991
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,114
Mr Okinwe...

992
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,996
Well, everything seems to be in order.

993
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,356
- And you are?
- His sister.

994
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,589
Of course you are.

995
01:17:12,589 --> 01:17:14,671
Well, carry on.

996
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,469
Declan.

997
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,197
Congratulations. Lovely wedding.

998
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,591
So, Sophie...

999
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,598
Has all this made you look at women
in, you know, a different way?

1000
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,756
How do you mean?

1001
01:18:06,756 --> 01:18:09,115
- You know.
- Quick, Sophie, read this.

1002
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,314
"Goodbye, world. I'm sorry, Sophie."

1003
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,754
- What does that mean?
- I think I know. Come on.

1004
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,076
- Freddie!
- Stop, Freddie! Don't move.

1005
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:38,631
I hope you haven't come up here
to talk me out of it, 'cause you won't.

1006
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:41,553
Don't come any closer. I will do it.

1007
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,353
I really thought I could do this.
Nothing ever goes right for me.

1008
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,356
Freddie, did you take
your medication today?

1009
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,039
You?

1010
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:56,953
You're the one that was
in the loony bin, not her.

1011
01:18:56,953 --> 01:19:00,077
Me? Course it wasn't me.

1012
01:19:00,077 --> 01:19:03,232
He nearly drove me to it. Everything
has to be bloody perfect with him!

1013
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:07,518
But it never is.
I'm such a useless excuse for a man!

1014
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,155
Nothing is ever perfect,
no matter how much you want it to be.

1015
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,351
So...

1016
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:24,676
- You don't love her.
- Course he loves me.

1017
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,476
No. She's right.

1018
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,791
I did, I did.

1019
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,271
But I don't love you anymore.

1020
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,277
I just wanted something
to go right for once in my life.

1021
01:19:46,277 --> 01:19:47,429
What?

1022
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,240
You moron!

1023
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,153
- You put me through all of this!
- I'm so sorry.

1024
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,315
- Can... Can you forgive me?
- No fucking way!

1025
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:01,433
For heaven's sake,
tell him you forgive him.

1026
01:20:01,433 --> 01:20:04,557
No. Till death us do part, he swore!

1027
01:20:04,557 --> 01:20:08,349
He'll be dead in a minute if you don't
do something. Is that what you want?

1028
01:20:08,349 --> 01:20:11,318
- Good enough for him.
- You don't love him either.

1029
01:20:11,318 --> 01:20:14,517
- So?
- Go on, woman. Go on.

1030
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,320
Go on!

1031
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,199
Freddie...

1032
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,238
I forgive you.

1033
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,829
You do?

1034
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,875
I do.

1035
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,839
Come down.

1036
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,351
It might have worked.

1037
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,391
No chance.

1038
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,791
We should have known the first time.

1039
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,271
It's just the way things are.

1040
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,472
- No. No, you keep it.
- It's yours, Freddie.

1041
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,391
I don't want it.

1042
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,111
I'll see you.

1043
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,429
You know, if I can't make this marriage
work, what kind of a man am I?

1044
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,151
Do you ever stop moaning?

1045
01:22:00,151 --> 01:22:02,310
Didn't you notice?
My marriage just broke up.

1046
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:05,392
Well, it seems to me
it was the best thing for everyone.

1047
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,712
Anyway, marriage is not the
be-all and end-all of life.

1048
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:14,199
Like you would know.

1049
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,033
- Oh. Molly told you.
- Yeah, she did.

1050
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,949
Well, maybe I'm not the best person
to be giving advice,

1051
01:22:23,949 --> 01:22:28,113
but you'll get over it,
find someone else even.

1052
01:22:28,113 --> 01:22:33,593
- Who'd want me? I'm a nutter.
- Go and look.

1053
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,199
What else have you got to lose, hey?

1054
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:40,716
And maybe just try living
with the next one for a while.

1055
01:22:40,716 --> 01:22:46,113
If it works out, you can risk marriage
in ten or 20 years.

1056
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,351
- I'd better find my daughter.
- Yeah.

1057
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,759
I'll do anything you want.

1058
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,351
I'll clean the house.

1059
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,189
I'll cook.

1060
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,151
I'll mind the kids.

1061
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,390
I'll lose weight. I'll go to a gym.

1062
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,392
Look, I'll do anything.
Just give me another chance.

1063
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,433
Not interested.

1064
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,749
No more drink. I'll give it up.

1065
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:11,349
Look, you mean everything to me,
you and the kids.

1066
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,312
Don't mind what that woman said.

1067
01:24:14,312 --> 01:24:17,312
Our marriage means something,
and it's worth saving.

1068
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,951
You know...

1069
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:27,638
I don't have to remember the last time
I loved you... 'cause I love you now.

1070
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,756
I always did.

1071
01:24:31,756 --> 01:24:33,831
And I always will.

1072
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,953
Just take me back, please.
Please.

1073
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,120
OK, OK.

1074
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:52,916
Just... Get up off the floor, you eejit.

1075
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,435
- One orange juice, please.
- Make that two.

1076
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,191
Ah, there you are.

1077
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:18,199
- You weren't that bad, you know.
- Shag off.

1078
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:21,272
Ah, don't be like that. It's a party.

1079
01:25:21,272 --> 01:25:23,351
- No, really.
- Come on.

1080
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,715
Hey, lads, lads, lads, lads, lads.

1081
01:25:25,715 --> 01:25:29,031
She's gonna do a song with you.
Go on, go on. Get up with the lads.

1082
01:25:29,031 --> 01:25:32,157
Come on, everybody.
They're gonna do a number. Come on.

1083
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,910
Go on, go on, go on,
go on, go on, go on!

1084
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,434
- Hi.
- Hey.

1085
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:52,116
- Your mum's looking for you.
- Hello, Freddie.

1086
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,479
I've paid for two weddings for you,
Freddie, boy. Two.

1087
01:25:57,479 --> 01:25:59,152
Do you know how much that is?

1088
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:06,712
And my daughter is still single...
and living in my house.

1089
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,837
Come here.

1090
01:26:09,837 --> 01:26:12,070
- Come on!
- Shit.

1091
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:13,878
In here.

1092
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,674
- I don't like him.
- Can't we talk about this?

1093
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,391
Thought you could
get away from me, did you?

1094
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,436
- Jesus...
- Hope you have you an idea.

1095
01:26:29,436 --> 01:26:31,158
Follow me. Follow me.

1096
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,868
Right.

1097
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,309
Shh.

1098
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,755
Oh, don't lock me out.

1099
01:26:42,755 --> 01:26:44,831
I'm getting angry now, Freddie.

1100
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,629
Where are you?

1101
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,271
Come back!

1102
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,199
Molly.

1103
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,950
- Oh... Oh...
- You.

1104
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,450
You.

1105
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,391
Freddie!

1106
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,951
Bye-bye, Freddie.

1107
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,711
Freddie.

1108
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,391
Oh, gosh.

1109
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,071
Oh! Are you...

1110
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,631
Are you Okay?

1111
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,637
- I'm fine.
- He should be locked up.

1112
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,675
I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything.

1113
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,239
All that matters to me
is that you're happy and safe,

1114
01:28:45,239 --> 01:28:47,470
and I couldn't even do that.

1115
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:50,028
- I've been a useless mother.
- No, you haven't.

1116
01:28:50,028 --> 01:28:53,476
I have. I haven't given you
anything you've needed.

1117
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,156
You'd have been better off without me.

1118
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,315
I'm gonna try harder, I mean it.

1119
01:29:00,315 --> 01:29:02,391
From today it'll be a new me.

1120
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,311
I don't want you to change.

1121
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,198
- Really?
- Yeah.

1122
01:29:08,198 --> 01:29:10,874
I like you just the way you are.

1123
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,470
- Warts and all?
- Yeah, warts and all.

1124
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,870
Come on, let's go home.

1125
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,869
Wait, wait.

1126
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,831
This is for you.

1127
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,071
Thanks.

1128
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:56,436
I wouldn't take it,
only we really need this.

1129
01:29:56,436 --> 01:29:59,557
You earned it.
Thank you for everything.

1130
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:04,754
- Oh, no.
- Easy, fella.

1131
01:30:04,754 --> 01:30:06,831
He doesn't like me.

1132
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,395
Best of luck to you two. I mean it.

1133
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,039
- Bye, Molly.
- See you, Dad.

1134
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,231
Come on.

1135
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,594
I'm looking forward
to going to bed.

1136
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,231
We're going home.

1137
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:46,675
Okay.

1138
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,471
It was nice to meet you.

1139
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,948
You too.

1140
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,350
Well... goodbye.

1141
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,832
Bye.

1142
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,675
Do you wanna get some breakfast?

1143
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,997
My treat.

1144
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,073
- What do you think?
- I could eat.

1145
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,949
Great.

1146
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:15,636
You know, I've two tickets to Italy
and hotel reservations.

1147
01:32:15,636 --> 01:32:18,678
The plane leaves at two.
Do you want them?

1148
01:32:18,678 --> 01:32:20,751
No, they're yours. You should go.

1149
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,429
I suppose I could try and get
another ticket. We... We could all go.

1150
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,316
What do you think?
He's a bit of a loony.

1151
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,231
So are you.

1152
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,589
Let's talk about it over breakfast.
