00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:45,270
Anne-Marie,

3
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:47,564
you are as the nymphs.

4
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:52,152
Like them, you are lissom and
could frolic in mossy glades,

5
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:57,387
drink at the springs, dance naked
in the moonlit summer nights.

6
00:02:57,508 --> 00:03:02,016
Bacchus would have presided at
the nuptials of Priapus Lestingois,

7
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:04,109
and his Chloë Anne-Marie.

8
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,291
My good wife is quite unable to make me
experience the joys of the flesh.

9
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:40,827
Must I therefore
renounce them?

10
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:45,172
While the gods grant me
the strength and inclination

11
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:48,511
and for as long as you are
indulgent, little nymph,

12
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:52,133
I shall be
your grateful lover

13
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:55,151
and my pipes shall sing
till their dying breath,

14
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:56,440
the praises of Eros.

15
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:05,170
To think the upstairs maid's soldier
never says a word

16
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,792
and the other who's just married
a dumb coalman.

17
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:11,086
You are lucky, Anne Marie,

18
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:13,902
but you deserve to be,
because you're pretty.

19
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:19,003
- I love you, Mr Lestingois.
- And I am lucky too.

20
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:24,773
Go... go prepare the soup.

21
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:28,875
And don't forget the salt.

22
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,490
I won't forget!

23
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,983
While thinking of tonight!

24
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:44,923
Expectation is an indispensable
condiment for dreary daily chores.

25
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,990
She's charming.

26
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:17,140
But I fell asleep last night
before going to her.

27
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:20,599
There's no getting away from it,
I'm growing old.

28
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,769
My pipes are weary

29
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,794
and some shepherd will soon
lure her with his fresher flute.

30
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:43,906
Back already?

31
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,675
I arrived in time
for The Aspersion.

32
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,781
- Ernest's burial was well attended.
- He was your only friend.

33
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:55,082
- I walked around the cemetery.
- A good appetizer.

34
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:15,316
- Come with me!
- No!

35
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:18,291
Come!
It's time to go!

36
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,507
Come on!

37
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:16,491
Have you seen my tyke?

38
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:22,073
A black dog with long hair...
he must've come this way.

39
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:29,499
- Dream of a time...
- Sure, sure.

40
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,386
...give a kiss.

41
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:35,282
The wild rose blossom
feels its bud opening.

42
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:39,153
How dark it is
in the valley.

43
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:10,483
Copper, have you seen my dog?
My dog...

44
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:15,057
- A dog?
- A black one with frizzy hair.

45
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,868
What else could you have
but a frizzy dog?

46
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:19,875
He just cleared out.

47
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,966
You better clear out, too.

48
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,179
Cos if you don't,
I'll run you in.

49
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:52,376
Tell me sir,
have you seen a dog?

50
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:57,671
I lost it a moment ago and I'm so upset;
it cost 10,000 francs.

51
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,436
- 10,000 francs?
- But of course!

52
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,164
Hey, friends...

53
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:07,057
The lady lost her dog
worth 10,000 bucks.

54
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:08,301
We'll look for it.

55
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:27,597
- What breed and colour?
- It's a brown Pekingese.

56
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:29,322
Don't worry,
we'll try to find it for you.

57
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,248
Thank you so much.

58
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:43,442
You look so sad, Miss.

59
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:45,567
Well, just imagine,
I've lost my dog.

60
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,093
- How terrible.
- To say the least.

61
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:51,238
Shall we search together?
Sure.

62
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:52,962
Hop in, Miss.

63
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:23,524
Give this
to the poor man;

64
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:26,931
one must always help
the less fortunate.

65
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:32,182
- Why are you giving me 5 francs?
- To buy some bread.

66
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:22,847
Here's 5 francs.

67
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:27,056
Are you crazy?
Are you making fun of me?

68
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:28,940
To buy bread.

69
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:57,741
How much is Lettres d'Hamabed?
- 60 francs, sir.

70
00:13:08,316 --> 00:13:12,282
- You find that expensive?
- For my purse, yes.

71
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:14,965
- You're a student?
- Yes, sir.

72
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,848
- You like Voltaire...
- Yes.

73
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,253
- And with good reason.
- He's the one with good reason.

74
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:27,058
- Here. Take it.
- I couldn't!

75
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,696
You wouldn't deny me the pleasure.

76
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:31,502
- Yes, of course!
- Wait a second.

77
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:36,788
Here it is.

78
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,634
- Take this, too.
- But you don't know me!

79
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:46,596
I know you better
than you imagine.

80
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:49,039
Your name is "Youth".

81
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,721
The next time you come,
not a word of this to my wife.

82
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:25,463
- Give me that.
- I'm doing no harm.

83
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:28,340
No, but you ought
to be dusting the piano.

84
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,739
Mrs Lestingois will complain
about the dust again.

85
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:33,940
Why do you have a piano
no one plays?

86
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,259
I know no one plays it;

87
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:38,097
we have a piano because
we're respectable people.

88
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:21,067
You're eyeing the ladies.
I'm jealous.

89
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:25,786
You mustn't be,
jealousy is a horrid sentiment,

90
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:28,262
worthy of neither your spirit
nor your beauty.

91
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:36,658
In the winter forest
the birds do freeze

92
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:40,816
their nests like graves
amid snowy trees

93
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:46,772
April flies in on the wing

94
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:52,687
A thousand voices
bless the spring

95
00:16:52,807 --> 00:17:03,261
Your smile is my Spring,
my heart feeling Cupid's sting

96
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:07,836
Your smile is my Spring

97
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,072
My Spring

98
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,871
Wait, wait!

99
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,065
Oh my goodness!
Oh, he is beautiful!

100
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:19,222
I've never seen
such a perfect tramp!

101
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:27,252
But what...?
But, he's crazy!

102
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:32,803
- What's wrong with him?
- He's crazy... crazy.

103
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,878
What is it?
What a crowd.

104
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:41,270
An accident.

105
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:32,188
Look there!

106
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:35,739
I've seen so many,
I don't bother anymore.

107
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:39,812
He's crazy, he'll drown.

108
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:43,203
A fine example of civic courage
from a man of our class.

109
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:15,238
There's a dead body.

110
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:04,732
Wait.

111
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:07,122
Let me. Let me.

112
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:14,815
It's crowded here.
Let's take him to my house.

113
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:17,126
- Is it far?
- No, just over there.

114
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:38,750
What courage!

115
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,939
They're not taking that
into my house.

116
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,024
Allow us to close the door.

117
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:05,549
Bring the bench, quickly.
On the bench.

118
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:12,157
- It's draughty.
- That's what he needs.

119
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,296
It rarefies the atmosphere,
but it's crowded here. Let's go.

120
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:51,962
- You're soaked.
- You noticed.

121
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:55,307
Hold his head.

122
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,354
The tongue... put it out.

123
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:06,007
Not yours, his; grip it
with your handkerchief.

124
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:13,259
Meantime, I'll keep up
artificial respiration.

125
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:20,598
Go get monsieur's old coat
and trousers from the cupboard. Hurry!

126
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:26,610
And bring some towels.

127
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:29,077
You are a hero.

128
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:45,660
- Hitting him?
- It's good for the circulation.

129
00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:49,676
- This seat was just reupholstered!
- I told you it could wait.

130
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:52,341
You've done a very fine thing.

131
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:01,608
The poor devil is breathing.

132
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:05,069
Sir, do change your clothes,
or you'll catch cold.

133
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:07,414
I brought monsieur's
old shoes too.

134
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:10,361
You, continue.

135
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:27,948
Slap his hands and face
as much as you can!

136
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:34,027
Don't you belong
to a life-savers club?

137
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:38,282
- No. Why?
- We'll petition a medal for you.

138
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:41,142
- I don't want a medal!
- Why not? You deserve one.

139
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:44,718
Quite right
and we'll see to it.

140
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,679
I belong to
a life-savers club, but,

141
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,303
I never saved anyone
cos I never got the chance.

142
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:55,687
- You need luck.
- And you need to know how to swim.

143
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:59,228
- You never learned?
- My specialty was runaway horses.

144
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,700
How are you,
my friend?

145
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:10,636
- Am I dead?
- You're very much alive.

146
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:13,891
This is the man
to whom you owe your life.

147
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:18,491
- He did it against my will.
- He's not himself yet.

148
00:25:19,347 --> 00:25:20,656
I'll just have to
do it again.

149
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:23,833
- What did he say?
- He may be crazy.

150
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:27,089
- Where are you going?
- To drown myself.

151
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:30,108
- Again?
- He means it.

152
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:32,091
Not after I pulled you out.

153
00:25:32,212 --> 00:25:34,871
- Why'd you pull me out?
- To save you.

154
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,335
It was to save myself
that I jumped in.

155
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:41,148
I'm sick of life.

156
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:45,949
You were probably alone;
with no one to resort to.

157
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:49,847
We'll rally round in support.
Won't we gentlemen?

158
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,623
Certainly, neighbour.

159
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:55,349
My wife must wonder
where I am.

160
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:58,644
So I'll be on my way.
See you. Bravo again.

161
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:03,259
I left my door open. I'll see
to the matter of your medal.

162
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:37,379
I'll leave you
in peace now.

163
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:41,187
Now that we've met,
I'm not going to abandon you.

164
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,488
You're no longer alone.

165
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:45,868
- Now, what's your name?
- Boudu.

166
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:47,453
- What?
- Boudu!

167
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:51,816
Well, Mr Boudu, come along
with me. This way.

168
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,499
Undress.

169
00:27:07,131 --> 00:27:12,523
Anne-Marie, fetch a nightshirt
and socks from the wardrobe.

170
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,214
She's nice,
is she your daughter?

171
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,195
Sit. Let me take your pants.

172
00:27:27,487 --> 00:27:30,900
- I've got a cold now.
- It's your own fault.

173
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,365
No, it's all his fault.

174
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,105
I'm hungry.

175
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,117
We'll get you some soup
and poached eggs.

176
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:48,367
I don't like soup...
and eggs hurt my stomach.

177
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:53,603
- What would you like?
- Sardines, bread and butter.

178
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:58,638
We'll get it for you.
Wait! I'm drying you off!

179
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:02,325
I want the lady to leave.

180
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:05,093
- Me?
- Yes, you.

181
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,630
- You want me to go?
- Yes, and faster than that.

182
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:11,120
Do as the poor fellow wants;

183
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:14,263
and open a tin
of sardines for him.

184
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:18,506
- My back was turned.
- Even so, you're embarrassing him.

185
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:20,565
She's embarrassing me.

186
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:24,845
Even with her back turned,
she's embarrassing me.

187
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,285
- My suspenders.
- They're worn out;

188
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,672
I'll give you some.

189
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,050
- No, no, I want mine.
- But, they're worn.

190
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,583
- They work for me!
- Ok, don't get excited.

191
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:41,237
I want my suspenders.
They're mine, my suspenders.

192
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:43,334
Here you are.

193
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:49,512
- Here's a nightshirt.
- Good, thanks.

194
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:52,367
It'll be too small.

195
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,925
Well, I wasn't expecting you.

196
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,341
- Go get one of my ties.
- No!

197
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,034
- Don't you want a tie?
- What is it?

198
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,369
It's a bit of cloth
worn around the neck.

199
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,733
Around the neck?
What for?

200
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:14,772
It's not an absolute necessity;
if you don't want one.

201
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,580
No, I don't want a tie.

202
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:23,639
Go fetch a pair
of my slippers.

203
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:28,944
Meantime, you can wear mine.

204
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,229
Now try on this coat.

205
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:54,662
What a get-up; I'd never dare
go out in the streets in it.

206
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:58,224
- Why?
- Kids would call me scum.

207
00:29:58,344 --> 00:30:00,991
Just pull your trousers
up a bit.

208
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:02,337
It doesn't fit.

209
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:05,064
I'll buy you a lovely
new suit tomorrow.

210
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,992
- One my size?
- You can choose it yourself.

211
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,326
- With black and white checks.
- The one you want.

212
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:12,578
- And are you paying for it?
- Of course.

213
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:14,973
In that case,
I'd love it.

214
00:30:16,093 --> 00:30:18,347
Here are your old slippers.

215
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:24,317
- Why's she putting them on?
- Because I like to.

216
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:25,778
Can't he bend down?

217
00:30:28,823 --> 00:30:30,720
She stuck her tongue
out at me.

218
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,133
Pay no attention,
she's a child.

219
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:38,311
I'm going to have to
sleep out again tonight.

220
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,865
- Here are your sardines.
- It's about time.

221
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:50,211
- Is it all right?
- Is it dripping on the bread?

222
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:54,931
No, it's fresh butter,
from Normandy.

223
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:57,643
It's much better
than drippings.

224
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:02,975
Drink a bit.

225
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:07,871
- Is it good water?
- It's white wine.

226
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,276
What's wrong?

227
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:15,621
It stings.

228
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,922
- You prefer water?
- Of course.

229
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,941
He's already drunk enough.

230
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:24,705
Get him some water
if he prefers it.

231
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:27,183
Nice and cold.

232
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,368
- Why is she saying, "Oh! Oh!"?
- No reason, it's only for fun.

233
00:31:46,936 --> 00:31:51,085
- What?
- What do you sell in your shop?

234
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:54,519
I sell books. I'm a bookseller.
Can you read?

235
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:59,436
A little... big letters.

236
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:14,333
I hope we're not going to keep
that dirty beggar here.

237
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:28,928
I don't at all know where
I'm going to sleep tonight.

238
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,177
Ah, yes.

239
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:33,663
Give him 5 francs
for a hotel.

240
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:37,902
- A hotel? Never!
- The water!

241
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:40,428
- Why?
- I'll never go to a hotel again.

242
00:32:40,547 --> 00:32:42,324
You don't like hotels?

243
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:47,055
Why didn't you
let me drown?

244
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,366
We'll make up a bed
for him on the divan.

245
00:32:50,484 --> 00:32:52,919
You're the master
of the house.

246
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:54,471
Is she your wife?

247
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:57,586
- What?
- Is she your wife?

248
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:02,900
Yes, that's Mrs Lestingois.

249
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,898
He's on familiar terms
with you now?

250
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,830
Do you mind?

251
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:08,328
Not at all.

252
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:10,928
Because I like you!

253
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:15,821
Her twitch is acting up.

254
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:29,297
Seriously, Edouard, what are
we going to do with this man?

255
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:32,598
Seriously, Emma,
I've no ideas yet.

256
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:37,868
I'm embarrassing you.
I can tell.

257
00:33:46,673 --> 00:33:48,653
Some dosh!

258
00:33:52,236 --> 00:33:55,101
They're lottery tickets I forgot
in the pocket of the coat.

259
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:56,451
- Lottery tickets?
- Yes.

260
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,596
I don't recall when
I bought them.

261
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:00,748
Yes, it was with Ernest.

262
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:05,383
- Poor Ernest.
- Yes, he's dead.

263
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,414
- He's dead? Ernest?
- Yes.

264
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:10,523
He's lucky.

265
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,304
Come, Anne-Marie,
it's nearly dinner time.

266
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:17,058
Set a place for my friend
Boudu to dine with us.

267
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:20,342
- No, I'm no longer hungry.
- You must eat.

268
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:23,205
I'll give you one ticket
and I'll keep the other.

269
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:25,867
You could win 100,000 francs.

270
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:29,274
Can you see yourself
with 100,000 francs?

271
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:40,106
What would you do
if you won 100,000 francs?

272
00:34:41,243 --> 00:34:43,687
I'd buy a bicycle.

273
00:34:44,485 --> 00:34:49,627
- Can you ride a bicycle?
- How, when I've never learned?

274
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:12,970
Where has
that creature got to?

275
00:37:19,296 --> 00:37:22,547
What are you doing there?

276
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:26,725
- Where are you going?
- Me? I'm not going anywhere.

277
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:29,505
Going to that girl downstairs?

278
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,491
Why aren't you asleep?

279
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,328
I can't sleep in a bed;

280
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,524
it's too hot.

281
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:49,631
It's too soft and I hate
sweating between sheets.

282
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,359
Don't you?

283
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,821
I think the bed
is a marvellous invention.

284
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:59,331
- Go to bed, then.
- I am going to bed.

285
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:49,691
Rosie!

286
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:53,782
- What?
- Have you any matches?

287
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:04,498
- Thanks. You don't need them?
- No, keep them.

288
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:25,406
Tell me, Edouard, did you know
that Ernest had a mistress?

289
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:32,524
I hope so for his sake.

290
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:35,609
Naturally, you approve.

291
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:38,729
And you didn't even
come to his funeral.

292
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:41,305
You won't choke
with emotion.

293
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,610
I have quite enough choking
with my asthma, thank you.

294
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:56,244
But you were his friend.

295
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,456
Not going to his funeral
means nothing.

296
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:02,150
I was his friend
and he knew it.

297
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:07,636
- I just don't understand you.
- So you noticed?

298
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:10,597
- Why did you cry the day he died?
- I cried?

299
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,344
I saw you.

300
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,976
What are you doing?
Luckily, I'm no longer thirsty.

301
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,549
Why did you
put salt on the wine?

302
00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:37,855
Because you made a stain...
it's to draw out the wine.

303
00:41:38,193 --> 00:41:40,476
She's nice, your wife.

304
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,567
- I leave you to your friend.
- You bug me.

305
00:41:48,412 --> 00:41:52,589
- What are you doing?
- It's to draw out the salt.

306
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,374
Instead of singing,
you'd better help Anne-Marie.

307
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:25,507
Let me take those.

308
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,990
- Don't forget about Judge Rougier.
- Judge Rougier?

309
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:48,567
You're to deliver the works
of Baudelaire.

310
00:42:49,073 --> 00:42:52,158
- Where does he live?
- The address is in the ledger.

311
00:42:52,577 --> 00:42:53,924
What time is it?

312
00:42:57,727 --> 00:42:59,371
The oaf! I'd better go.

313
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:08,624
- Fine mess you made.
- It's 2 o'clock.

314
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:21,958
I've had enough!

315
00:43:28,112 --> 00:43:30,775
Help me pick them up.

316
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:35,121
It's your fault, too.
Why did you ask me the time?

317
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:39,349
- Just for a laugh.
- I'm not laughing.

318
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:42,809
I didn't think you'd drop
the tray to take out your watch.

319
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:45,685
It's broken.

320
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,544
- Did you wind it?
- I wind it all the time.

321
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:51,937
You wind it too much.

322
00:43:52,108 --> 00:43:56,794
When monsieur gave it to you,
he said to wind it only once a day.

323
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,627
He gave it to me
because it's broken.

324
00:43:59,965 --> 00:44:00,938
Think so?

325
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:04,439
He wore it when
he jumped in the water.

326
00:44:04,866 --> 00:44:08,965
- You forget it was to save you.
- He could've taken it off.

327
00:44:09,554 --> 00:44:11,372
He'd not have thought of it.

328
00:44:14,245 --> 00:44:18,175
It's always the same;
everyone takes advantage of him.

329
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:23,238
And that man. What a beast!

330
00:44:39,715 --> 00:44:41,242
Boudu!

331
00:44:42,754 --> 00:44:46,768
- Did I spit again?
- Yes, you know how I detest that.

332
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:49,685
- You have a handkerchief, right?
- I have a handkerchief.

333
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:51,795
Use it for goodness sake.
Use it.

334
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:56,113
- I thought it was for nose- blowing.
- It's also for spitting in.

335
00:44:56,403 --> 00:45:01,099
And afterwards?
What do you do with it?

336
00:45:01,224 --> 00:45:03,676
- Put it in your pocket.
- But that's dirty.

337
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,576
Less dirty than spitting
on the ground.

338
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:07,647
Anyway, you'll do as I say.

339
00:45:07,777 --> 00:45:11,245
Don't lose your temper;
I'll spit wherever you say.

340
00:45:16,903 --> 00:45:20,071
- What now?
- He's tickling me!

341
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:21,597
- Who me?
- Yes, you!

342
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:23,419
- Boudu.
- What?

343
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:25,779
You must mend your ways,
my friend.

344
00:45:25,905 --> 00:45:26,840
Me?

345
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:33,479
You must mend your ways,
my friend.

346
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,080
Boudu.

347
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:19,581
Where did you spit?
I didn't spit.

348
00:46:19,982 --> 00:46:22,382
You must have spit on the floor.

349
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:24,483
I didn't spit.

350
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:26,984
It seemed so to me.
I didn't spit.

351
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:05,085
No, no, let me go.

352
00:47:05,286 --> 00:47:07,086
Stop fooling around.

353
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:18,211
He's not very serious,
Mr Lintesgois.

354
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:21,584
Who's that?

355
00:47:22,578 --> 00:47:27,735
Mr Lintesgois;
he makes me laugh, that lad.

356
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:33,483
He's a maniac, Lintesgois.

357
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:35,689
Lestingois.

358
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:39,349
- What did I say?
- Lintesgois.

359
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:45,595
You should at least know
your benefactor's name.

360
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,255
It's such a long name.

361
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:54,788
This is dirty;
it should go to the laundry.

362
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:56,789
Boudu.

363
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:20,424
What a pig!

364
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:48,634
So you don't
find him serious?

365
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:53,292
First of all, he'd
never seen me before.

366
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:57,543
So why did he fish me out?
I can't think why.

367
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:02,449
Maybe he needs a servant.
I'd like to understand.

368
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,524
Stop playing around!
I'm all wet!

369
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:10,941
If it was thanks monsieur wanted,
he got short-changed!

370
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:13,858
Lestingois. Lestingois.

371
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:18,013
- You don't say thank you?
- Leave me alone for once!

372
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:20,972
It would deprive you
to say thank you.

373
00:49:21,098 --> 00:49:24,256
- I've never thanked anyone.
- I guessed as much.

374
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:29,419
- Did you guess all by yourself?
- All by myself.

375
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:34,952
- Do you eat well here?
- Yes, I eat well.

376
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,825
- You sleep here, too?
- Yes, I sleep here, too.

377
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,826
And you look good
in your nice suit?

378
00:49:40,116 --> 00:49:41,987
Yes, I look good in it.

379
00:49:42,114 --> 00:49:46,891
And to whom do you owe your
enjoyment of all these comforts?

380
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,019
To God.

381
00:49:48,558 --> 00:49:53,389
- What if monsieur hadn't saved you?
- I'd be in heaven.

382
00:49:53,474 --> 00:49:55,053
Suicides don't go to heaven.

383
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,380
You don't know religion
and you're ungrateful!

384
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,331
Me, ungrateful?

385
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:10,994
- Do you want me to kiss you?
- Don't get carried away.

386
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,524
- Do you know how to kiss?
- I don't.

387
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:22,350
- Would it be your first kiss?
- No, I used to have a dog.

388
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:23,765
A dog?

389
00:50:25,476 --> 00:50:27,174
He kissed me.

390
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:30,090
- He licked you?
- He licked me.

391
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,046
- And you kissed him?
- Yes.

392
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,247
Did you enjoy it?

393
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:42,241
- You could kiss me.
- What became of your dog?

394
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:43,822
I don't know; he disappeared.

395
00:50:44,203 --> 00:50:47,361
- Maybe you didn't kiss him well.
- Oh, I kissed him well.

396
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,976
- Do you want to kiss me?
- I don't like men with beards.

397
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:54,680
Want me to cut it off?

398
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,637
Yes, cut it off;
then we'll see.

399
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:02,636
- Then you'll kiss me?
- We'll see... if I like you.

400
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:12,204
Do you like me now?

401
00:51:19,155 --> 00:51:20,361
You're crazy.

402
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:23,397
- The barber must cut your beard.
- Why?

403
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:27,936
- You're uglier than before.
- Kiss me now.

404
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,096
Don't touch me
or I'll call Mr Lestingois!

405
00:51:31,596 --> 00:51:37,549
- What's the matter?
- I wanted to kiss her.

406
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,919
And I didn't want him to.

407
00:51:40,127 --> 00:51:42,296
Your beard is lopsided.

408
00:51:42,422 --> 00:51:45,369
She said she'd kiss me
if I'd cut it off.

409
00:51:45,748 --> 00:51:48,495
- Did you promise?
- No, I swear.

410
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:53,820
Here's money for the barber;
get him to shave you.

411
00:51:58,444 --> 00:52:01,393
You're not going out
like that, are you?

412
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:03,765
Your shoes aren't polished.

413
00:52:03,975 --> 00:52:07,925
- Cos my shoes aren't polished?
- Of course, you fool.

414
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,682
You aren't angry with me,
are you?

415
00:52:38,175 --> 00:52:43,089
- Why should I be?
- I never see you at night now.

416
00:52:43,297 --> 00:52:46,420
How can I see you
with that creature about?

417
00:52:47,377 --> 00:52:48,792
He can't hold his tongue.

418
00:52:49,372 --> 00:52:51,499
I'm sure you're no keener than I,

419
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:54,950
for madame to find out about
our nightly meetings.

420
00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:01,192
It's all so sad.

421
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:04,810
I'm bored all alone
in my room.

422
00:53:12,883 --> 00:53:16,758
You don't think my thoughts
exactly frolicsome, do you?

423
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:21,252
Do you regret
having saved him?

424
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:24,665
At night, yes.

425
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:28,373
What am I doing?

426
00:54:31,327 --> 00:54:33,451
I'm getting upset.

427
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:06,198
What about your delivery
to Judge Rougier?

428
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:07,575
I'm going.

429
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:02,504
What a beast.

430
00:56:28,971 --> 00:56:31,423
I'm off to the barber.

431
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:40,870
Are your shoes polished?

432
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:43,495
You bet they're polished.

433
00:57:02,718 --> 00:57:04,384
Edouard!

434
00:57:08,965 --> 00:57:12,417
- Know what Boudu's done now?
- What has he done now?

435
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:14,373
He's left the kitchen tap on.

436
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:17,450
- Really?
- The room is flooded.

437
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,150
What is it now?

438
00:57:27,231 --> 00:57:30,603
Your friend Boudu!
Look!

439
00:57:33,644 --> 00:57:38,213
I'm tired of laughing things off;
he'll have to go at once!

440
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:39,007
I told you so.

441
00:57:40,132 --> 00:57:41,756
Nothing can be done
with this creature!

442
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:42,833
I told you so
the first day.

443
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,205
One should help only
one's own kind.

444
00:57:46,705 --> 00:57:48,577
You'd certainly
be better rewarded.

445
00:57:53,659 --> 00:57:55,445
But what will become of him?

446
00:57:55,819 --> 00:57:58,609
I hope that's
no longer your concern.

447
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:00,941
But I am still concerned.

448
00:58:01,065 --> 00:58:05,515
He may disgust me, but
I did give him his life back.

449
00:58:06,518 --> 00:58:08,094
I'm a sort of
godfather to him.

450
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:11,136
Off on your
high-flown talk again.

451
00:58:12,465 --> 00:58:16,712
After another futile sermon,
you'll let him stay.

452
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:19,457
I said he must go
and he will...

453
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:21,450
...tomorrow.

454
00:58:34,813 --> 00:58:35,648
What is it?

455
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:40,638
He spat in Physiology
of Marriage. The pig!

456
00:58:41,973 --> 00:58:46,175
Even if it takes my boot
on his backside, he'll have to go.

457
00:58:46,668 --> 00:58:52,499
There's no need for brutality;
it won't take me long to tell him.

458
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:56,452
- He spat on Balzac.
- He respects nothing.

459
00:58:56,577 --> 00:59:00,234
- And a magnificent edition, too.
- I'm not surprised.

460
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:02,611
I simply wouldn't
have believed it!

461
00:59:04,027 --> 00:59:06,313
This is the reward
for your devotion.

462
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:38,814
You seem angry, Mr Lestingois;
not with me, I hope.

463
00:59:38,939 --> 00:59:42,768
No, you know how much
I enjoy your presence.

464
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:45,885
But Boudu's always
between us now.

465
00:59:46,097 --> 00:59:47,512
Not for long, I promise.

466
00:59:47,803 --> 00:59:49,301
- Really?
- Yes.

467
00:59:49,846 --> 00:59:51,009
How wonderful!

468
00:59:51,262 --> 00:59:52,753
I thought you loved him.

469
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,633
- Boudu?
- Yes.

470
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,874
I'll love you
all my life.

471
00:59:57,993 --> 01:00:01,283
Of course, but you might have...
loved him too.

472
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:05,698
At the same time as you?
I'm off, or you'll make me cry.

473
01:00:06,113 --> 01:00:09,155
Tears make you look so pretty
that I'd have no regrets.

474
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:20,518
I'm quite exhausted.

475
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:11,739
BARBER

476
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,956
Been to the barber?
Very nice.

477
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:15,825
- Madame has something to say to you.
- To me?

478
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:23,983
The man who spat in Balzac's
Physiology of Marriage,

479
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:27,560
- means nothing to me.
- Who is that man?

480
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:29,554
Go and ask my wife.

481
01:02:45,956 --> 01:02:48,075
Where is she?

482
01:02:56,398 --> 01:03:00,516
So there's another spitter,
is there?

483
01:03:00,685 --> 01:03:03,599
Don't be stupid;
I want to talk to you.

484
01:03:07,636 --> 01:03:09,716
I smell nice, don't I?

485
01:03:10,297 --> 01:03:12,254
Yes.
You've been to the barber?

486
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:15,332
Do you like me now?

487
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,621
- Me, Mr Boudu?
- Yes, you.

488
01:03:20,326 --> 01:03:23,491
- Don't be so familiar.
- What are you saying?

489
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:27,775
Listen to me, Boudu.

490
01:03:29,024 --> 01:03:32,687
We, Mr Lestingois and I,
are your benefactors.

491
01:03:32,811 --> 01:03:34,768
Yes, I know.
I know.

492
01:03:35,556 --> 01:03:37,887
You do not seem fully aware,

493
01:03:38,013 --> 01:03:41,885
of the obligations
inherent in your situation.

494
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:43,797
What is she saying?

495
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:50,245
You come into an honest,
middle class family,

496
01:03:50,369 --> 01:03:54,244
and start behaving
like a caveman!

497
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:59,363
In cleaning your shoes, you made
complete pandemonium of my room!

498
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:03,843
- Panty yummy yum?
- Don't be funny!

499
01:04:04,718 --> 01:04:08,337
It's disgraceful! Can't you
clean your shoes properly?

500
01:04:08,464 --> 01:04:09,833
How's that?

501
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,492
Everything you need
is in the kitchen!

502
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:16,860
- Polish?
- There's polish in the kitchen!

503
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:18,104
I don't like polish.

504
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:22,430
No, you prefer my satin quilt!
It's disgraceful!

505
01:04:22,555 --> 01:04:25,212
- I won't do it again.
- Too late!

506
01:04:28,627 --> 01:04:31,530
- What's that you have there?
- What?

507
01:04:31,658 --> 01:04:32,946
- I don't know.
- Here?

508
01:04:33,823 --> 01:04:35,112
A beauty spot.

509
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:37,524
What was I saying?

510
01:04:37,649 --> 01:04:41,429
I don't know. Why do you have
a mark like that?

511
01:04:41,554 --> 01:04:42,842
Let's stick to the point.

512
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:46,166
I like you, Emma.

513
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:51,612
Please, do not forget
to show me the proper respect.

514
01:04:51,737 --> 01:04:54,233
- I'll give you respect.
- What's gotten into you?!

515
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,639
Why are you making these faces?
You're frightening me!

516
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:03,052
- Afraid, Emma?
- Yes, I'm afraid!

517
01:06:23,786 --> 01:06:26,698
Victory, dear neighbour!
Victory!

518
01:06:32,473 --> 01:06:36,591
It's done!
You've been decorated!

519
01:06:39,957 --> 01:06:44,158
For rescuing Boudu; it will be
announced tomorrow.

520
01:06:44,285 --> 01:06:49,023
Ridiculous; anyway, I didn't make
a formal written request.

521
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:54,593
I and madame signed it,
as a surprise for you.

522
01:06:54,717 --> 01:06:59,462
A forgery. Now
I'm simply going to look ridiculous.

523
01:06:59,584 --> 01:07:02,201
Your master has been decorated
for his good deed.

524
01:07:03,535 --> 01:07:07,401
It's done; your husband has been
decorated, thanks to me.

525
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:11,015
Have you really
been decorated?

526
01:07:11,436 --> 01:07:15,010
- Apparently so.
- Thanks to me!

527
01:07:15,506 --> 01:07:18,251
Let me embrace you,
dear benefactor.

528
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:24,530
A good deed's never wasted;
let's drink to it.

529
01:07:25,528 --> 01:07:27,603
Let's go.

530
01:08:24,107 --> 01:08:28,967
Excuse me, my friend, I can't see
Mr Lestingois; is he out?

531
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,965
Lestingois?
Aren't I alive?

532
01:08:32,797 --> 01:08:34,833
A while ago I asked him,

533
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:38,365
for a popular first edition
of The Flowers of Evil.

534
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:42,983
This isn't a flower shop,
it's a bookseller's.

535
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:47,555
I'll look in again.

536
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:52,206
The flowers of evil.

537
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:05,678
- Tell me, Anne-Marie.
- What?

538
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:08,007
- Did you see that client?
- Which client?

539
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:12,290
- The one who just left.
- No, I've just arrived.

540
01:09:14,244 --> 01:09:16,118
What of him?

541
01:09:16,242 --> 01:09:19,277
You should have seen me
deal with him.

542
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:22,437
I could be a bookseller
if I wanted.

543
01:09:29,543 --> 01:09:34,204
A bookseller who'd never
passed any exams.

544
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:51,952
- Where would you sell books?
- Here, and you'd be my little wife.

545
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:03,385
When I tire of being sensible,
I'll think of you.

546
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,723
I want it to be now.

547
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:26,000
- I've a present for you.
- What is it?

548
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:30,578
The lottery ticket monsieur gave me
the day he fished me out.

549
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:32,950
He gave it to you,
so keep it.

550
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:36,565
I love you,
so what's mine is yours.

551
01:10:36,688 --> 01:10:38,559
You love me?
Lucky me!

552
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:41,180
Don't you want to be
my little wife?

553
01:10:41,431 --> 01:10:43,173
When there are 2 Sundays
in a week.

554
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:46,417
- Alright; will that be soon?
- Wait and see.

555
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:50,616
- You're making fun of me?
- You've finally noticed?

556
01:10:50,743 --> 01:10:53,362
You're a bad girl.

557
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:17,976
Complete list of winning numbers
in the Colonial Exhibition lottery!

558
01:11:55,803 --> 01:11:58,137
Is it you, Mr Lestingois?

559
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:13,641
Hey, what's this number here?

560
01:12:13,974 --> 01:12:15,890
It's 346.

561
01:12:16,091 --> 01:12:19,506
- And this one?
- It's also 346.

562
01:12:22,831 --> 01:12:26,117
- Is that your ticket?
- Yes, it's mine.

563
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,654
Then you've won
100,000 francs.

564
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:31,104
What the hell
is it to you?

565
01:13:06,318 --> 01:13:08,025
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

566
01:13:16,587 --> 01:13:19,210
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

567
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:24,321
- Mr Lestingois isn't here?
- Not unless he's become invisible.

568
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:26,983
Are you afraid?

569
01:13:27,106 --> 01:13:29,599
Why are you running away?
Do I scare you?

570
01:13:30,434 --> 01:13:35,543
Is your conscience troubling
you so much? Bad boy!

571
01:13:35,671 --> 01:13:36,752
I'm not bad.

572
01:13:36,874 --> 01:13:39,534
Have we forgotten
everything already?

573
01:13:40,077 --> 01:13:43,029
Silly boy,
nobody's going to hurt you.

574
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:44,943
On the contrary.

575
01:13:46,024 --> 01:13:49,598
Aren't you happy here?
Tell me.

576
01:13:50,476 --> 01:13:54,254
What's wrong?
Answer me, darling.

577
01:13:55,004 --> 01:13:57,413
What's been wrong
the last eight days?

578
01:13:57,911 --> 01:14:00,448
Do you flee your beloved?

579
01:14:00,863 --> 01:14:02,903
There is no temptation.

580
01:14:03,196 --> 01:14:05,480
What are you doing there?
My God!

581
01:14:05,727 --> 01:14:08,143
If you faint, I'll slap you!

582
01:14:09,804 --> 01:14:11,346
I'm so ashamed!

583
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,212
- Think of the scandal.
- You shut up as well.

584
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:20,322
- There are points to clarify.
- They're all quite clear enough.

585
01:14:20,447 --> 01:14:22,567
I'm going to be able
to marry you.

586
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:23,524
Be quiet.

587
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:31,214
The situation is perfectly clear,
blindingly so, in fact.

588
01:14:31,338 --> 01:14:32,840
So I shall make no fuss.

589
01:14:32,965 --> 01:14:39,152
Nonetheless, morality demands
the situation be put right.

590
01:14:40,572 --> 01:14:45,348
Edouard, the ticket...
The lottery ticket...

591
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,921
100,000 francs.
You see... I won. I won!

592
01:14:50,048 --> 01:14:53,168
- So, then...
- I won.

593
01:14:59,153 --> 01:15:01,400
Let us bless happy fortune,

594
01:15:01,772 --> 01:15:04,017
in the form of a lottery ticket
which permits

595
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,797
union between carefree youth
and innocent beauty.

596
01:15:09,089 --> 01:15:15,533
For once, both modern morals
and laws of nature are satisfied.

597
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:21,185
Let us invite the gods to preside
over the union of Priapus Boudu...

598
01:15:21,729 --> 01:15:24,264
...and his Chloë Anne-Marie.

599
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:13,406
I can't eat this
without bread.

600
01:24:44,868 --> 01:24:50,020
Where's Boudu? Did he run away
or did he drown?

601
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:52,891
A savage!

602
01:24:54,633 --> 01:24:58,581
I don't care one bit,
wherever he may be.

603
01:24:58,832 --> 01:25:01,287
It's his destiny,
drifting with the currents.

604
01:25:06,943 --> 01:25:11,687
In the blue water
and the blue firmament

605
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:16,420
the violins sow
their haunting strains

606
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:22,115
and the love vows of the sender
ever sweeter and more tender

607
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:28,973
hold you in love's embrace again

608
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,073
