1
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:51,989
Good morning, Lula. This is the
Reverend Beverly H. Hooker.

2
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:57,297
Temperatures up around 99.

3
00:00:57,805 --> 00:01:02,469
Now let's get things started
with the Heaven on a Hookup cycle.

4
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:52,552
Bud, we got a letter
from your sister this morning.

5
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:55,393
- I ain't reading it.
- Fine.

6
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:57,824
- I'll read it.
- I ain't listening.

7
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:01,865
That's fiine too.
You don't even have to listen.

8
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:04,570
"Dear brother and Raynelle:

9
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:08,536
I was expecting
to see you at services Sunday...

10
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:13,212
...but I guess there was
something good on TV. Again.

11
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:17,575
- I know you love that wrestling."
- Damn straight.

12
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:22,345
"I wonder if they'll
have TVin hell.

13
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:25,990
I heard Junior's business
went belly-up.

14
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,194
When will your son learn?"

15
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:32,331
She should talk. One in the pen,
another on the way.

16
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:37,664
"I think both our sons could learn
something from Buster's boy.

17
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:41,897
Saturday he mowed the front yard...

18
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:47,273
...the side yard and them
three acres behind the house.

19
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,947
His birthday is coming up...

20
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:54,847
...so I gave him three dollars
instead of the usual two.

21
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,853
That's about all the news for now.

22
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:01,289
I'm coming over
Sunday after services.

23
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:04,258
One of you, Bud...

24
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,362
...needs to get right with the Lord.

25
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,932
And I'm the lady for the job.

26
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:12,572
We're gonna spend the whole
day singing...

27
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,936
...and praying until
we wear you down.

28
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,734
Like it says in 2 Peter 3:8:

29
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,075
'One day is with the Lord
as a thousand years.'

30
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:26,115
Your loving sister, Marguerite."

31
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:30,779
Well, Bud.
What did you think of that?

32
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,054
Bud?

33
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:03,116
Aw, hell no.

34
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:07,188
Oh, you're not getting off
that easy.

35
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,929
- Good God, Mama!
- Did you take the Lord's name in vain?

36
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:20,538
- What the hell do you want?
- Don't talk filth!

37
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,105
Are you still in bed?

38
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,507
Why aren't you looking for a job?

39
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,773
Because it's 7:00 in the morning!

40
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:34,215
You wouldn't happen
to be suffering from a hangover?

41
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:37,685
Are you laid up there
with some harlot?

42
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:43,852
Wake up, harlot! What time is it?
You hear me?

43
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,794
Mama, what do you want?

44
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:49,967
I just thought you should know...

45
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:53,070
...your Uncle Bud...

46
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:55,366
...he passed this morning.

47
00:04:56,376 --> 00:05:00,472
I'm sorry to hear that, Mama.
How's Aunt Raynelle doing?

48
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:02,715
How you think she's doing?

49
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,975
Her husband just dropped dead...

50
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:09,144
...in the middle of
one of my letters.

51
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,515
Imagine that.

52
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:15,387
So we need to go over there
and give them some comfort.

53
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,563
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What do you mean, "we"?

54
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,292
You're turning
your back on your family?

55
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:26,932
Can't someone else come get you?

56
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,368
Call Junior or Ray Bud.

57
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,736
They have too much to do.

58
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,776
And I would just die...

59
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:35,638
...if my own son...

60
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:40,080
...didn't want to take me
to comfort my brother's widow.

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,279
Or maybe I should walk to Lula
in this heat.

62
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,654
Or just drop dead from heat stroke!

63
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:50,728
Okay, Mama, okay already.

64
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:52,592
When do you want to go?

65
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:55,800
When do you think?
Next month?

66
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:59,336
Get your worthless self
over here now.

67
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,007
Bud won't keep long in this heat.

68
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,913
Reverend, are you sure you don't
want a ham? I've got three.

69
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:11,173
No, thank you. That's kind of you.

70
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,443
It must be a blessing...

71
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,349
...having your daughter with you
in your bereavement.

72
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:18,950
Yes, it is.

73
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:24,357
- You've met Delightful, haven't you?
- Yes, I believe I have.

74
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:27,927
She's so precious to me.

75
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:31,133
I can see why.

76
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:38,139
Being that brother Bud wasn't a
regular member of the church...

77
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:43,281
...I was hoping you'd tell me
a little about him...

78
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,745
...that I can include in my remarks.

79
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:50,720
In your own words,
what kind of man was brother Bud?

80
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:54,457
Well...

81
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:56,161
...he was mean.

82
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:00,566
- Mean?
- Mean as a snake.

83
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,894
- I see.
- And surly.

84
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:04,328
Surly?

85
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:10,600
Sister, I didn't know
brother Slocumb well.

86
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,642
But to me he seemed...

87
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:17,406
...a quiet man.
A man of inner strength.

88
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:20,610
A man who knew his own mind...

89
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,915
...and was at peace with the world.

90
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:27,116
A wise, noble, gentle man.

91
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:31,525
Well, you didn't know him
until he got old and sick.

92
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:35,495
But he was mean,
and he was right surly.

93
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:40,767
Sister, in my experience,
it's best...

94
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:43,634
...to remember the happier times.

95
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,813
Well, they were few and far between.

96
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:51,013
Let me explain something to you,
reverend.

97
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:56,188
After my two boys were born,
I decided to go back to church.

98
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:59,955
And once we went
to a revival meeting.

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,492
And I got saved.

100
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:04,594
And I was so happy.

101
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:08,399
I came rushing back to tell Bud.

102
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:12,834
He hit the ceiling.
Cursed me out real good.

103
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,399
And I said, "Bud!

104
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:17,666
This is your immortal soul.

105
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:21,005
If you don't go
to that revival meeting...

106
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:23,341
...it will be in danger."

107
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,409
He wouldn't have it.

108
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,745
So I said, "Well...

109
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,422
...if that's how you feel...

110
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,888
...I'm just gonna
cut you off altogether."

111
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:38,288
- I beg your pardon?
- Not so much...

112
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:42,262
...as a warm handshake in 20 years.

113
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,833
Except for that one time.

114
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:57,543
Well, I believe I have all the
information I'm gonna need.

115
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,686
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

116
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,759
Lord knows how I'll get through it.

117
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:14,798
The humiliation of knowing
Daddy Bud died...

118
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:19,161
...knowing you never made
nothing of yourself.

119
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:23,265
It'll be sad to think that...

120
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:26,674
...Daddy knew we sold everything...

121
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:31,850
...to move into that trailer to
pay off that dream of yours.

122
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,321
Set that to music, Charisse...

123
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,954
...you'll make everyone cry.

124
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,151
I was just stating the facts, Junior.

125
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,853
I loved him like my own daddy.

126
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,665
You know something, Junior?

127
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:54,134
I was just thinking
your family never liked me.

128
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:55,501
Never!

129
00:09:55,775 --> 00:10:00,940
They're looking down at us
just having a good old laugh.

130
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:07,214
Who ever thought of a machine
that cleans parking lots? Really!

131
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:11,680
All our money right down the crapper.
Whoosh!

132
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,220
Just gone.

133
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,393
Damn it, boy! Damn shoe.

134
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:20,633
Walk around
with one on your foot now.

135
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:24,531
You know, I could have been
a professional.

136
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:28,005
- I had talent.
- Talent?

137
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:35,078
Let me tell you something else,
Mr. Funnyman...

138
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:40,081
...I could have been lap-tied
to your cousin Teddy Wayne...

139
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,585
...and been the wife of a lawyer.

140
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,421
You're pushing it.

141
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:48,593
But I couldn't think about myself.

142
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:54,256
I had to listen to my heart
and marry a fool.

143
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,731
Who spent all our money
on his dream.

144
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:01,038
- I'm gonna kill us, Charisse.
- Oh, please!

145
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:05,677
- I'm gonna kill us.
- You ain't gonna kill nobody.

146
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:09,211
I'm gonna kill us!

147
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,350
Shut up! Just shut up!

148
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,926
My daddy just died.

149
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:32,801
I'm 33 years old, I'm dead broke,
I've got no money...

150
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,736
...three kids and worst of all
I'm married to you.

151
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:39,572
Now just shut it up!

152
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:46,218
I swear before God,
one more word about parking lots...

153
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:50,150
...I will kill you, and me too.
You got that?

154
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:53,651
Do you got that?

155
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:02,735
You'll have to buy some bullets first.

156
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:05,097
Put that thing away.

157
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:08,331
Put it away!

158
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:12,678
How dare you pull that out
in front of these kids?

159
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:17,947
You know your daddy was just playing.

160
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,116
He really love us...

161
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:24,915
...he just goes through something
sometimes. Right, baby?

162
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,650
Y'all play nice, now.

163
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:38,326
I'm trying to make
funeral arrangements.

164
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:42,535
Ray's family will
probably ride in the hearse.

165
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:45,471
So tell Antoine...

166
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:47,836
Oh, he does?

167
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:52,109
What if one of us drove it?
Ray Bud's a good driver.

168
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,344
Let's toss him on a truck.

169
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,952
I've gotta let you go, okay?

170
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:59,887
I got family coming
and nothing to eat.

171
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,651
So I'll stop by later, okay?

172
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:05,694
And we'll work out the details.

173
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:12,394
Thanks, Merline.

174
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:16,301
What are you thanking her for?
Damn thieves!

175
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,505
Ray?

176
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:25,673
Antoine and Merline are grave robbers.

177
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,820
Now, Ray, let's just stay calm.

178
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:34,186
And why is Daddy at Depew's anyway?
Slocumbs always go to Patterson's.

179
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:38,055
I don't know, but
it's what your mom wanted.

180
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:41,232
It's revenge.
I'm right where he wants me.

181
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,866
What do you mean?

182
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:46,664
Antoine Depew. "P.U." Depew?
Remember that?

183
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:50,569
- You started that?
- It followed him all through school.

184
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:53,074
Ray, you're talking crazy.

185
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,410
You know how I hate funerals, Lucille.
People asking how you feel.

186
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:02,154
- It doesn't matter how people feel.
- Honey!

187
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,524
It's all right. Okay? Just relax.

188
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,592
I know how hard this is.

189
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:12,423
You and Daddy had some problems.

190
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:14,462
But we're family.

191
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:17,966
And we'll get through this
together. Okay?

192
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,932
There you go.

193
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:22,639
Speaking of family...

194
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:26,037
...Marguerite is
staying with your mama.

195
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:28,643
- That's good.
- Good. And also...

196
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:33,250
...Junior's family is staying here.

197
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,954
- No!
- Ray Bud, he's your brother.

198
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:39,487
Not here. They can go stay at a motel.

199
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:42,524
- They can't afford it.
- Is that my fault?

200
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:45,755
Did I make him
follow that pipe dream?

201
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:49,560
You shouldn't talk like that.
He tried so hard.

202
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,636
Face it, Lucille, he's an idiot.

203
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:55,340
I don't need Charisse's mouth...

204
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,634
...or those demonic kids.

205
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:00,278
We'll talk about it tonight.

206
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,745
But don't forget the shoes.
Size 10-D.

207
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,816
I'll remember, Lucille. Okay?

208
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:12,648
We're not gonna have any problems,
are we?

209
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:16,454
We're not gonna have any problems.
But do me a favor.

210
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,425
When I die...

211
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:22,192
...just bury me out in the backyard.

212
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:41,684
What is in your mouth?

213
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:44,219
What's wrong with you?
Give me that.

214
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,549
Boy, eat it!

215
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,885
Let it go!

216
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:52,690
- Junior?
- What?

217
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,701
- What's this?
- I don't know.

218
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:00,699
This looks like a woman's earring,
but it ain't mine.

219
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:02,602
- Junior!
- What?

220
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:04,774
Whose is it?

221
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:09,209
- Baby, I don't know.
- You don't know?

222
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:13,579
You want me to help you remember?
Is that it?

223
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:27,196
- Ray Bud?
- Yeah?

224
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,674
It's all just a mystery, huh?

225
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,672
Life and death.

226
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,740
Yes, it is, Clyde. Yes, it is.

227
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:52,016
Ain't easy losing your daddy.

228
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,887
Taught you how to bait a hook.

229
00:16:56,095 --> 00:17:00,429
Teach you right from wrong,
bought you your first beer.

230
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,759
We remember the good things.

231
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:07,134
Yep. I ought to get back
to this carburetor.

232
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,501
We're not just a garage, Ray.

233
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,101
We're your family.

234
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:17,406
Back when you was a drunken bum,
we stood by you.

235
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,743
Paid your bills, lied to your wife.
Family things.

236
00:17:22,522 --> 00:17:26,049
And I sure am grateful for that,
Clyde.

237
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,723
Of course, I wouldn't let
Antoine and Merline Depew...

238
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,430
...bury my dog, much less my daddy.

239
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:38,198
So if you have any problems,
just give us a call.

240
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:43,873
- Thank you, Clyde, I gotta get back.
- Now if...

241
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:45,908
...you just say the word...

242
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:51,945
...the Depews will pay more in hearse
repair than they make in a year.

243
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:57,453
Thank you, Clyde.
I'll keep that in mind.

244
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:58,815
Ray Bud?

245
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,954
It's your cousin Royce.

246
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:05,761
This is Ray.

247
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,093
Where are you?

248
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,798
What did he say?

249
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:13,971
He'll get here when he can.

250
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,238
Do you do this to torture me?

251
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:22,607
Yeah, Mama. I siphoned out the gas
so we'd have time together.

252
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:26,110
You're a demon.
The devil incarnate.

253
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,779
IKeep your drawers on, okay?

254
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:31,013
Ray Bud is on his way...

255
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,418
...and he can't get here
fast enough for me.

256
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:39,254
So let's just sit here
and be quiet for a while.

257
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,538
Jesus got the knob!

258
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:31,972
That's cool...

259
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,982
...that's cool.

260
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:38,917
- 'Cause Satan got the key!
- Give me that!

261
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,394
I cannot believe I spent 17 hours...

262
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:47,155
...in labor with you!

263
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,364
You get back here! Royce!

264
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:57,565
You get back here, boy,
before I hurt you!

265
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:04,446
We combine a thrifty,
no-nonsense approach...

266
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,380
...with a Christ-like sensitivity...

267
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,249
...to answer all your funeral needs.

268
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,655
We have a number of wonderful plans.
Let me tell you about them.

269
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:21,229
The Eternal Life plan...

270
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:22,901
Seventeen hours...

271
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,293
...of unbelievable torment.

272
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:28,233
Crying out in unbearable agony!

273
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:33,172
Would it kill you to do one thing
to please me?

274
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:36,313
- It looks that way.
- Since you got fired...

275
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:40,484
...from that sewage plant,
you've been with a bad crowd.

276
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,916
You'll be like your brother.

277
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:45,180
Leave Lavar out of this.

278
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,119
Maybe you'll end up neighbors in jail.

279
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:53,323
The two of you can beat on
the bars with your tin cups.

280
00:20:55,601 --> 00:21:00,129
- I ain't got time for this...
- You wait up, boy!

281
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:03,469
There's a gas station
down this road.

282
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm gonna get some gas.

283
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:09,470
Go on, get your gas.
Maybe if I'm lucky...

284
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:13,276
...I'll get killed by some big semi!

285
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,612
So go on, get your gas.

286
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,987
All right, Mama.

287
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:25,561
What do you want to talk about?

288
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:27,527
Where is your life going?

289
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:30,198
Them unemployment checks...

290
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:34,700
...don't come forever.
Have you thought about that?

291
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:38,399
Life isn't just drinking
and loose women.

292
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:42,079
- Life is not a good time.
- You're proof of that.

293
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:44,875
Boy, watch your mouth or...

294
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:48,746
You straighten up
or you'll burn in hell.

295
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:52,081
You better come up with a plan,
and soon.

296
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,192
- I got a plan.
- Well, what is it?

297
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,051
You're right.

298
00:21:57,363 --> 00:22:01,265
Those checks won't come forever.
I think about that.

299
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,593
When they stop...

300
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:05,631
...I'm gonna find me a gal.

301
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:09,205
A good Christian gal
and settle down.

302
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:11,433
Quit all this foolishness.

303
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:15,738
I know you want grandbabies.
You've always said that.

304
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:19,275
I figure I'd have me one or two kids.

305
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:25,919
So I can get on welfare.

306
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,592
Welfare?

307
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:30,762
- Is that your plan?
- That's it.

308
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:34,828
You want to know
what I say to that?

309
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,409
Now, look here...

310
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:58,588
...I'll throw in the folding
chairs this one time.

311
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,620
Return the funeral books
in the morning.

312
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:05,156
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

313
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,471
Oh, no, no! Oh!

314
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:21,545
I have people coming.

315
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:23,947
What am I gonna do?

316
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:27,782
I hope they like corn dogs.

317
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,968
Come on, Delightful.

318
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:59,307
- What about this one?
- Whatever you want, Mama.

319
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,410
I like the Diplomat.

320
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:05,556
Who cares what you like, Satan?

321
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,419
Does it really matter?

322
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,855
What you gonna do?
Put him in a pine box?

323
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:13,361
Of course not, Marguerite.

324
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,534
- Corn dog, Mama Ray?
- No, thank you.

325
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,533
You a lying, stubborn man! Get out!

326
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:24,268
Junior? Is Charisse all right?

327
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:29,506
I think so.
Sometimes she gets these headaches.

328
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:32,513
That's too bad.
You want a corn dog?

329
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:37,419
- Thanks, Lucille.
- You're welcome. Take a napkin.

330
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:47,892
- You decide on anything?
- Mama's still thinking.

331
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:53,094
- I like the Heavenly Express.
- You do, do you?

332
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:57,273
- It's pretty.
- It seems kind of pricey to me.

333
00:24:57,643 --> 00:25:00,908
You can't be thinking like that, man.

334
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:05,413
This is our only Daddy
and we're gonna do this right.

335
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:08,449
We ain't gonna worry about cost.

336
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:11,389
- Yeah?
- That's what family's for.

337
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:16,558
- Here's what I think...
- Ray, will you help me in the kitchen?

338
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,827
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Charisse!

339
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,903
- How you feeling?
- Not well, Lucille.

340
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:30,598
- My kids driving you crazy?
- No. They're outside.

341
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:37,340
Stop that!
Don't make me come out there!

342
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:40,915
I'll beat your ass
if your daddy won't.

343
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,610
Lucille, listen...

344
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:45,653
...can I borrow some nerve pills?

345
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:48,122
Sure. I'll be right back.

346
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,851
- Precious...
- Junior! Get my shoe.

347
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,922
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,607
Here you go, sweetie.

349
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:12,042
I'm sorry you're not feeling well.

350
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:15,180
Mama Ray, I'm the one that's sorry.

351
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:19,219
'Cause I've watched something
I loved...

352
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:24,555
...shrivel up and die right
before your very eyes.

353
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:26,462
It's sad.

354
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:30,362
- Here you go, Charisse, honey.
- Thank you.

355
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,969
- You are a comfort.
- You're welcome.

356
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:34,969
Honey, we should just...

357
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:39,234
...go lay you down in the bedroom
so you can rest.

358
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:43,572
Maybe you're right.
I am feeling a little faint.

359
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:49,680
- Did I just drop something?
- Charisse?

360
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,220
I believe it's your earring.

361
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:55,483
This is not mine, Lucille.

362
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:58,492
Everybody, take a look at this.

363
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:01,563
I would never, ever...

364
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:06,203
...wear something so cheap and tawdry!
- Charisse...

365
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:11,104
...you should be laying down
when those pills kick in. Come on.

366
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:14,177
All it takes is some thought...

367
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:17,678
...but I know I know who owns this.

368
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:22,581
Just a little thought, baby.
I'm gonna find out who it is.

369
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:27,283
I could have married
the rich Slocumb, Teddy Wayne!

370
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:32,790
- I vote for the Heavenly Express.
- So do I.

371
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:37,262
Now can we talk about headstones
before we all die?

372
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:40,131
I'm sure you got something to say.

373
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:44,307
I think it should
include some scripture.

374
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:49,345
- My first idea was Ecclesiastes 2:16.
- Aunt Marguerite, please!

375
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:54,110
"There is no remembrance
of the wise more than of the fool..."

376
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:58,389
- Aunt Marguerite, please.
- No, no, Ray.

377
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:01,185
That would be good, Mama.

378
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,385
Look, could we slow down a little?

379
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:06,892
For the price of the stone...

380
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:10,965
...we get the date of birth and death.
More costs extra.

381
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,600
- Extra?
- Two bucks a letter.

382
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:17,037
- How many words in that?
- One, two, three...

383
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,878
That won't cost too much.

384
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:22,876
It'll be more than you'll kick in.

385
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:25,078
So what are you saying?

386
00:28:25,284 --> 00:28:27,809
You saying I won't pay my share?

387
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:32,615
It's easy for you to come in
here and shoot your big mouth off.

388
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:35,919
- Would he do that for you?
- Yes, he would.

389
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:37,254
You're dreaming.

390
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:39,761
This is our last chance...

391
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:42,957
...to help Dad, and you're being cheap.

392
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:45,432
It's not all about money.

393
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:50,472
That's why you don't
have two nickels to rub together.

394
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,738
I saw that new used truck outside.

395
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,444
I heard about your trip
to Swamp World.

396
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:03,153
- What about it?
- I'd like to take my kids there.

397
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:05,287
- What about that?
- Yeah?

398
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:10,655
Those monsters can ride around on
your invention in the parking lot.

399
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:15,627
- You talk about my machine, my kids?
- Yeah. Yeah.

400
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:18,359
Why you talk about my kids?
IKnow what?

401
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,403
- At least I got kids.
- Okay, tough guy.

402
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:29,572
Let me go so I can kick your ass!

403
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:32,874
- Come on!
- Don't let him do that to you!

404
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:36,848
Ray! Junior!

405
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:42,016
Stop it, stop it!

406
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:45,218
Stop it!

407
00:29:45,564 --> 00:29:47,759
Stop! Don't move at all!

408
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:59,534
Come here, Royce.

409
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:09,751
I want you to take this to Antoine's
and tell him...

410
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:14,415
...that this is what I want
on my husband's headstone.

411
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:18,058
It's 12 letters.

412
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:20,922
My wallet's in the kitchen.

413
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,261
- This is between us, right, Royce?
- Yes, ma'am.

414
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,565
I'm just gonna get some air.

415
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:35,376
Don't say anything to me.

416
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,885
Sorry, Mama.

417
00:30:48,227 --> 00:30:50,286
How can you act like this...

418
00:30:50,496 --> 00:30:53,932
...when your mama
is going through all this?

419
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:56,564
Bud would be so upset.

420
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:00,102
And you, acting like
you can't hear me.

421
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:04,469
You gonna show me that note!
I can't believe this.

422
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:10,711
You a real tough guy, ain't you?

423
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:19,716
"Mean and surly."

424
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:22,590
Damn.

425
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:32,002
Okay, Aunt Marguerite.

426
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:34,899
Oh, she's doing fine.

427
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:41,071
Yeah, okay. I'll look that one up.

428
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,520
Good night, Junior.

429
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:54,749
Good night, Lucille.

430
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:08,867
Hey, Ray.

431
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:22,214
You got yourself a little taste, man.

432
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:27,855
Yep.

433
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,858
You told Lucille you quit.

434
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:34,361
You know how I lie.

435
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,669
Sure is hot out here tonight, Ray.

436
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,938
Damn, reminds me of that time...

437
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,579
Sit down, Junior.

438
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:09,565
Thanks, Ray. Sure do appreciate this.

439
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:16,906
Sure is funny
how things work out, ain't it?

440
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:21,409
Oh, yeah. I just laugh myself
to sleep every night.

441
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:29,417
Look here, Ray.

442
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:32,181
I didn't mean what I said in there.

443
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:36,724
I was real sorry to hear
Lucille lost that last baby.

444
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:42,227
I guess she was all
tore up about that.

445
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:44,628
Sorry.

446
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,140
We should just quit trying.

447
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:02,285
'Cause last time
was the absolute worst.

448
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:06,156
The doctor told her...

449
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:10,418
...she'd have to
lay flat on her back, not move.

450
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:16,427
We talked about it and
decided to give it one more shot.

451
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,502
She went to bed,
I went to get her prescription...

452
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:22,137
...and a bedpan.

453
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:26,334
Got a chicken bucket in case
she had to go while I was gone.

454
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,140
It took longer than I expected,
and when I got back...

455
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,350
...she lost it.

456
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:36,981
In the chicken bucket, Ray?

457
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:40,689
Chicken bucket, Junior.

458
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:47,161
Damn, Ray.

459
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:52,931
That's the most God-awful story
I've ever heard.

460
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:55,602
It's pretty bad, man.

461
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:06,045
I was sorry to hear about
your business going under.

462
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,315
Thank you, Ray.

463
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,667
So you gonna tell me or not?

464
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,665
I don't know,
it just kind of happened.

465
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:34,976
I was at the Shop Well parking lot
giving a sample cleaning.

466
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,316
And there was this girl
loading up her car.

467
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:42,884
We sort of
struck up this conversation.

468
00:35:43,088 --> 00:35:45,682
So I started talking
about the machine.

469
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:48,256
She seemed real interested.

470
00:35:48,593 --> 00:35:50,220
I mean, here I was...

471
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:55,523
...sitting on top of this big machine
like I was its master.

472
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,599
And there was this woman...

473
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,098
...staring at me.

474
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:01,931
Smiling at me.

475
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:06,602
You know, making me feel
like a man, Ray.

476
00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:11,878
I was in business
and I had control of my life.

477
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:13,749
What happened?

478
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:16,953
Aw, Charisse showed up.

479
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:20,656
She was looking all hot and sweaty...

480
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:24,384
...with all them kids
hanging off of her.

481
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:27,829
She wanted to talk about...

482
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:31,934
...house payments, car payments...

483
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,933
...how the kids need this and that.

484
00:36:35,307 --> 00:36:38,674
And the whole time she was talking...

485
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:44,075
...I watched that woman pack up
her stuff and drive away.

486
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:50,152
And all of a sudden I got
this strong desire to just...

487
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:55,321
...run Charisse over
with that machine.

488
00:36:57,763 --> 00:37:01,130
So what happened with the woman,
Junior?

489
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:04,262
Old Bernice Talbert.

490
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:07,605
- Bernice Talbert?
- Oh, yeah.

491
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:12,136
- Bernice with the?
- Oh, yeah. Two.

492
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:25,547
So now what?

493
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:28,218
I don't know, Ray.

494
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:33,229
Things just so messed up now, man.

495
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:36,557
I gotta get some money.

496
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,497
You will.

497
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:41,672
You'll figure it out.

498
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:43,397
Just not tonight.

499
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,343
Junior...

500
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:58,351
Why don't you bring
your machine over...

501
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:02,821
...and polish up the driveway
on Sunday. I'll pay you.

502
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:04,620
If you're not busy.

503
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,866
- No, Ray. Sunday's good, man.
- Yeah?

504
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,835
Thanks, bro.

505
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:31,616
Hey, Ray?

506
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:37,853
I never thought he'd die, man.

507
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:40,524
Did you?

508
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:05,915
Well, friends,
it's been another busy day.

509
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:13,690
And as I rush from place to place...

510
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:19,929
...offering comfort and counsel...

511
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:24,164
...to some of our brothers and sisters
in crisis...

512
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:29,539
...catharsis, and confusion...

513
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:32,113
...I ask myself, "Beverly...

514
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:36,046
...what is this thing called life?

515
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,984
Is it nothing but a collection of...

516
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:48,558
...problems, disappointments
and heartache?

517
00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:53,900
Or do we make it that way
with all our...

518
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:57,108
...wants, needs and desires?

519
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:13,690
And if it is, we, ourselves...

520
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,325
...then why do we do it?

521
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:23,526
Why don't we realize that the slender
and fragile canoe of life...

522
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:26,599
...can be so easily overturned...

523
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:30,138
...in the turbulent rapids
of the world?

524
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:35,705
God's gonna handle your problems.

525
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:40,479
Why don't we learn to relax?

526
00:40:41,553 --> 00:40:44,021
And why do we...

527
00:40:44,222 --> 00:40:47,487
...have to call somebody
when we're troubled?

528
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:52,388
Why can't we just keep it
to ourselves?

529
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:57,902
God handles your problems.
Listen to him.

530
00:41:01,806 --> 00:41:04,036
Remember, friends...

531
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:07,405
...our time here is short.

532
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,639
If you feel your life is nothing...

533
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:14,045
...but unrelenting torture...

534
00:41:15,253 --> 00:41:17,585
...try to make the most of it.

535
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:21,547
After all, tomorrow...

536
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,421
...is another day.

537
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:28,426
Yes, call God...

538
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,198
...don't call me.

539
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:37,841
Well, let's see here.

540
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:43,036
Friends, tonight,
we have a new sponsor:

541
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:47,608
Depew's Funeral Home.

542
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:51,378
"Your Pit Stop to the Afterlife."

543
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:57,860
Depew's Funeral Home,
where longtime Lula resident...

544
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:02,225
...Woodrow "Bud" Slocumb
is currently in repose.

545
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,227
He sure looks good.

546
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:12,303
Feets look funny.

547
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:16,947
My daddy's wearing ballet shoes.

548
00:42:17,248 --> 00:42:20,445
You know Daddy Bud
always had arthritis.

549
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:22,882
When he had his stroke...

550
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:27,056
...he pointed his toes down
and they stayed that way.

551
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:29,590
New shoes wouldn't fit at all...

552
00:42:29,828 --> 00:42:32,888
...so they just did
the best they could.

553
00:42:33,098 --> 00:42:34,998
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Ray!

554
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:38,167
- Lucille?
- Hello there, Merline.

555
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:41,463
Somebody has to organize this food.

556
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:45,675
And all these people
gotta be out of here by 8:15...

557
00:42:45,944 --> 00:42:48,777
...as there's a Bisons meeting
in here.

558
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,505
Just take those to the kitchen...

559
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:56,153
...and I'll be right in. Thank you.
So nice of you.

560
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:58,549
Thank you, I'll be right in.

561
00:43:00,325 --> 00:43:03,954
Go over there
and say hello to the people.

562
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:07,358
You can do it, baby. I know you can.

563
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:21,009
Hey, Buster. Tiny.

564
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,648
Bud's inside. Go on in.

565
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:28,146
I'll be back. Can I get you anything?

566
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:31,416
Can you give me back
the last 12 years?

567
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:36,919
Can you give me back my
dreams of a loving, faithful husband?

568
00:43:37,195 --> 00:43:38,822
Can you do that?

569
00:43:40,498 --> 00:43:41,658
No.

570
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,825
But I can get you a Pepsi.

571
00:43:45,837 --> 00:43:47,532
Pepsi's fine, adulterer.

572
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:50,436
Damn it!

573
00:43:53,178 --> 00:43:54,475
You better run!

574
00:43:57,615 --> 00:44:01,676
I'll be right back.
Just a minute. Pepsi, right?

575
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:08,348
I love you.

576
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:16,727
Come on.

577
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:26,168
Ray Bud. From your mama.
I think you should see this.

578
00:44:34,786 --> 00:44:37,380
"Mean and surly"?

579
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:56,807
They painted you up
like a two-dollar whore.

580
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,880
We sure are sorry about Bud.

581
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:08,581
I'm so glad you and Norval
could make it.

582
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,482
He looks better than he did
last time.

583
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:14,624
Since his bypass got done...

584
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:16,985
...he's improved a lot.

585
00:45:17,295 --> 00:45:21,994
Next month, we're getting rid
of that prostate, aren't we?

586
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:28,399
It's times like these you find out
who your real friends are.

587
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:34,507
They park that hearse right out
on the street, you know?

588
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:42,145
Anything could happen to it,
catch my meaning?

589
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:46,147
I catch your meaning, Uncle Clyde.

590
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:56,832
Say the word and that thing might
just blow up some evening.

591
00:45:57,635 --> 00:45:58,624
Thank you.

592
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:01,828
Stranger things have happened.

593
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,137
All right, come on.

594
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:10,544
Let's just go in there and see him.

595
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:12,980
All right, okay.

596
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:16,213
Go on ahead. I'll be right there.

597
00:46:16,454 --> 00:46:18,183
You want me to wait?

598
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:20,516
No, I don't want you to wait.

599
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:23,522
Go on, I'll be in
in a minute.

600
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:37,967
My God, what the...?!

601
00:46:38,176 --> 00:46:40,474
Don't you ever touch me!

602
00:46:49,754 --> 00:46:52,882
What's the matter? Can't you
take care of things?

603
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:56,588
Now look.
Junior can't keep his pants on.

604
00:46:56,861 --> 00:47:01,730
Your sister won't stop eating,
and your wife can't have kids.

605
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:05,391
I believe what you need is a drink.

606
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:22,785
My bad, my bad, Ray.

607
00:47:24,856 --> 00:47:26,949
Can't look at him, can you?

608
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:49,045
How's she gonna go on,
Aunt Marguerite?

609
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:54,115
How's she gonna face life
without Daddy Bud?

610
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:57,779
It's sad when a woman loses
her husband.

611
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:02,256
I remember when I lost my William.

612
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,759
No one to cook for,
no one to clean for...

613
00:48:05,997 --> 00:48:09,489
...nobody to talk to
over the breakfast table.

614
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:16,969
And these is my twins,
Latanya and Lasagna.

615
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:20,508
You're so lucky to have
those precious babies.

616
00:48:20,812 --> 00:48:23,610
Ladies, just find some space.

617
00:48:23,948 --> 00:48:27,406
That's Tamika,
from my second marriage with J.C.

618
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:30,951
Has anybody seen my sister-in-law?

619
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:34,117
- Oh, Lord, where has he gone?
- Where?

620
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:38,294
Why can't it all be the way
it used to be?

621
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:42,192
Daddy Bud! Come back! Come back!

622
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:53,173
Get ahold of yourself!

623
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:58,808
Let's go freshen you up.

624
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:02,075
After I irrigate him
for about an hour...

625
00:49:02,353 --> 00:49:05,220
...I usually put him out
on the porch...

626
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,752
...while I cook.

627
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:09,789
One time, I left him out there...

628
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:13,656
...and the mosquitoes ate his butt up.

629
00:49:13,865 --> 00:49:15,628
You getting anything?

630
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:21,400
I had the same problem
when my daddy died.

631
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:27,236
I guess seeing him like that
made me realize he was gone.

632
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:30,206
Wasn't no going back.
Gone forever.

633
00:49:30,481 --> 00:49:32,915
Really consoling, thank you.

634
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:38,211
You know, he looks good.
For a dead man.

635
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:42,921
You seen Charisse?

636
00:49:43,194 --> 00:49:46,595
Lucille dragged her to the toilet.

637
00:49:46,831 --> 00:49:50,824
Shoot! I ran all the way down
to get the Pepsi...

638
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:56,903
Would you look at that?!

639
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:00,401
He looks dead.
You need to look at him.

640
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:02,511
I'm sure he does.

641
00:50:03,848 --> 00:50:08,512
I'll just leave you fellas here,
so you can do your thing.

642
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,712
And, Ray, it helps to remember
the good times.

643
00:50:12,924 --> 00:50:14,516
Thank you, Royce.

644
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:18,752
If you can remember any.
I'll be in the back.

645
00:50:20,097 --> 00:50:22,292
There it is, Ray. Look at it.

646
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,727
Come on. It's death.

647
00:50:25,036 --> 00:50:29,063
Look at the Grim Reaper
staring you in the face.

648
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:32,367
- Come on, just one...
- No, Junior.

649
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:35,436
Damn, Ray.

650
00:50:36,414 --> 00:50:37,904
You don't look so good.

651
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:40,644
Get me out of here. Now.

652
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:47,086
What's with the dancing shoes?

653
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:53,156
Charisse? We're getting
kind of backed up out here.

654
00:50:56,968 --> 00:50:58,663
I'll be right there!

655
00:50:58,903 --> 00:51:00,734
Okay, hurry up!

656
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:16,980
Look out, got to go. Hey, Mom.

657
00:51:19,457 --> 00:51:20,788
Get out of there!

658
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,821
You just look gorgeous.

659
00:51:33,104 --> 00:51:38,098
Honey! I'm just so sorry Teddy Wayne
couldn't be here.

660
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:42,044
He always loved his
Uncle Bud so much...

661
00:51:42,346 --> 00:51:44,940
...but his firm is doing so well...

662
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:47,707
...it just keeps him so busy.

663
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:49,885
Well, what a shame.

664
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,216
Mama Ray must be torn up.
We got to find her.

665
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,559
I can do this.

666
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,058
I can do this.

667
00:52:05,636 --> 00:52:07,194
I can't do this.

668
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:24,182
Supper's his big meal of the day
if he can keep it down.

669
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:27,288
But once he gets his bedtime pills...

670
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:28,890
...he sleeps well.

671
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:31,218
But I don't get any rest...

672
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:34,522
...having to turn
him every few hours.

673
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:37,331
You're just so lucky to have him.

674
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,803
I know.

675
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:43,703
I know.

676
00:52:44,942 --> 00:52:47,433
Where do you want this Jell-O?

677
00:52:48,546 --> 00:52:50,013
Over there.

678
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:52,046
You know...

679
00:52:52,516 --> 00:52:56,680
...it's a shame it takes this
to bring us together.

680
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:04,089
Remember Lucille was in my royal
court when I was Candy Camp Queen?

681
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:08,064
No. Was that when I was dating
Teddy Wayne?

682
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:13,202
That was such a long time ago.
But you're right, Juanita.

683
00:53:13,404 --> 00:53:17,807
It's good to know we can come together
in a time of sadness.

684
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:20,806
You are so right, Lucille, so right.

685
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:26,380
Now.

686
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,342
- How can I help?
- Break a nail.

687
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:32,350
Honey, why don't you...

688
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:35,957
...go out there and make people happy?

689
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,153
It's so sweet of you. Thank you.
I'll do my best.

690
00:53:46,203 --> 00:53:50,697
I could've married
Teddy Wayne Slocumb if I wanted to.

691
00:53:51,909 --> 00:53:55,777
I could've been rich and stupid!

692
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,041
I would've been good at it!
But look at me.

693
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:05,314
But who am I now?
I'm poor and foolish in a trailer.

694
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:07,690
What happened to me?

695
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:13,428
Honey, don't pay no attention to her.
She just thinks she's happy.

696
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:18,233
Delightful? Could you grab
that big bowl over there?

697
00:54:18,536 --> 00:54:21,334
Be careful. It was my mother's.

698
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:23,803
You're all right now.

699
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,341
Are you still
in your church groups?

700
00:54:35,586 --> 00:54:39,488
I'm vice president of the
Ladies' African Missionary Club.

701
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,749
Get a rag and wipe that off.

702
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,718
Oh, my God. Delightful!

703
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:49,229
Y'all go out front till
dinner's ready, about 15 minutes.

704
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:58,441
Honey? People are beginning
to talk about you.

705
00:54:59,043 --> 00:55:02,012
You gonna stay in there all night?

706
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:04,078
Baby?

707
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:08,610
You're the only woman for me.

708
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:11,013
I knew that from day one.

709
00:55:11,222 --> 00:55:14,282
Remember how we went to Dairy Whiz?

710
00:55:14,525 --> 00:55:17,688
And I bought that
Fizzy Cream you like.

711
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:22,626
And we sat out on your front yard?

712
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,630
Talked about our future,
feeling so good.

713
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:28,862
Like we had our whole lives before us.

714
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:31,037
I don't know, baby.

715
00:55:31,275 --> 00:55:33,937
You know I ain't good at this.

716
00:55:34,612 --> 00:55:37,945
Out in that parking lot,
I just lost my head.

717
00:55:38,782 --> 00:55:41,876
And now I'm praying that...

718
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:45,417
...you might want to take me back.

719
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:50,989
'Cause if I learned one thing,
it's that I'm nothing without you.

720
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:55,792
You are my world, Charisse.

721
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:57,427
And I love you.

722
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:04,964
I love you too, Junior.

723
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:08,139
You could have told me it was you.

724
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,658
At least it was quick.

725
00:56:32,336 --> 00:56:34,031
Quick's the best way.

726
00:56:34,305 --> 00:56:37,502
You don't want to linger.
That's awful.

727
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:38,970
Quick.

728
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:42,279
That's how I want to go.

729
00:56:43,147 --> 00:56:45,707
Car crash. Bolt of lightning.

730
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,216
Piano falling on my head.
That's what I want.

731
00:56:50,988 --> 00:56:53,218
That's what I want for you.

732
00:56:53,524 --> 00:56:55,014
Me too.

733
00:56:57,828 --> 00:57:01,889
God, we both know there's
nothing in that liquor store...

734
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,464
...to help me or anyone.

735
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:07,136
So if you can start this car...

736
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:11,705
...before I reach the door handle,
I'd appreciate it.

737
00:57:14,178 --> 00:57:15,167
Evening, Ray.

738
00:57:16,747 --> 00:57:19,238
Reverend. Mrs. Hooker.

739
00:57:19,817 --> 00:57:23,412
We're about to visit your family
for a while.

740
00:57:23,654 --> 00:57:25,884
Did you want to follow us?

741
00:57:26,657 --> 00:57:28,386
You bet, reverend.

742
00:57:38,669 --> 00:57:40,261
Thank you, God.

743
00:57:58,288 --> 00:57:59,448
You seen Royce?

744
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:02,157
No, honey. Not in a while.

745
00:58:02,393 --> 00:58:04,384
I hope y'all can use this.

746
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:07,125
Well, thank you, Bernice.

747
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:17,268
- No! Uh-uh.
- We're gonna start real soon, Merline.

748
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:19,532
We're gonna start real soon.

749
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:21,608
Delightful, do me a favor...

750
00:58:21,879 --> 00:58:25,576
...put this up
where no one can get to it, okay?

751
00:58:26,817 --> 00:58:30,048
- That's a bowl of funk.
- It's Bernice's.

752
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:33,650
- Is that Bernice Talbert?
- Uh-huh.

753
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:38,458
- She's a God-awful mess.

754
00:58:38,662 --> 00:58:40,926
She ain't no one's prize...

755
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:44,623
...and she'll rip that skirt off
for anyone.

756
00:58:44,835 --> 00:58:47,395
I saw her not two weeks ago...

757
00:58:47,638 --> 00:58:50,971
...staggering out of some
old Cadillac...

758
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:54,642
...wearing one earring. Just tacky.

759
00:58:56,213 --> 00:58:59,478
- All right, y'all...
- Anyone seen Charisse?

760
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:05,711
- Bernice Talbert?
- What'd I say?

761
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:12,588
My husband did it to that child
in the Shop Well parking lot?!

762
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:15,788
Lord, take me now!

763
00:59:17,234 --> 00:59:20,897
Don't pay her any mind.
She just likes attention.

764
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,072
Will you quit harping on that?

765
00:59:25,576 --> 00:59:28,943
Come on, we got a lot
of good food here.

766
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:34,012
We got beans, macaroni and cheese,
some yams and...

767
00:59:34,284 --> 00:59:37,776
...somebody even brought us some...

768
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:43,258
Who brought this?

769
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:46,628
Lucille? Honey, what's wrong?

770
00:59:49,299 --> 00:59:53,099
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

771
00:59:54,505 --> 00:59:57,633
Get out! Out! Out!

772
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:02,571
- Lucille?
- Leave me alone!

773
01:00:04,248 --> 01:00:09,015
Charisse! Don't nobody care about
your husband and Bernice.

774
01:00:09,253 --> 01:00:12,416
Come out here
or I'll sic Delightful on you.

775
01:00:12,923 --> 01:00:16,916
- Let me come in for one second.
- Leave me alone!

776
01:00:18,529 --> 01:00:23,228
- You don't understand!
- I don't understand?

777
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:28,562
You think you're the only one with
heartache? I have a son in jail!

778
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:33,471
You don't see me wallow on the floor,
or hiding in a closet.

779
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:36,812
This closet's taken,
you can't have it!

780
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:41,380
Move! You want anger, lady?

781
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:44,746
You listen to me.
We are family!

782
01:00:44,955 --> 01:00:49,051
We are the Slocumbs!
And we are gonna serve this dinner...

783
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:52,387
...with our heads held high
if it kills us.

784
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:56,327
Now you come on.
You come on right here.

785
01:00:59,303 --> 01:01:04,502
Come in, people, get your plates.
We ain't got all day.

786
01:01:06,843 --> 01:01:11,143
I am so glad you could come,
reverend.

787
01:01:11,415 --> 01:01:15,181
Mrs. Slocumb, I am sorry
and I'm glad I can be here.

788
01:01:15,586 --> 01:01:18,111
I'm just so sorry, Ray.

789
01:01:18,322 --> 01:01:20,654
Thank you, Charles. Thank you.

790
01:01:21,258 --> 01:01:24,352
I had no idea your daddy
was a dancer.

791
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,466
It was a well-kept secret, Charles.

792
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:33,861
We thank you, Lord,
for these blessings.

793
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:36,197
And last but not least, Lord...

794
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:41,376
...you know who has done filthy things
with Bernice Talbert.

795
01:01:41,678 --> 01:01:44,943
I won't repeat their names,
but I could...

796
01:01:45,182 --> 01:01:48,709
...if I was provoked. Amen.
- Amen.

797
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:50,180
In Jesus' name.

798
01:01:50,454 --> 01:01:55,517
Everyone, step lively.
The Bisons have this room next.

799
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,248
I just wanted to call...

800
01:02:56,453 --> 01:03:00,412
...and make sure you
got into the house okay.

801
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:04,855
- We here, Ray.
- We'll be home in a little bit.

802
01:03:15,072 --> 01:03:19,270
I sure hated not being able to
visit with everybody.

803
01:03:20,377 --> 01:03:23,608
It's just so sweet.
All those people.

804
01:03:24,114 --> 01:03:28,574
Each of them touched in some way
by Daddy Bud.

805
01:03:30,153 --> 01:03:32,348
They was touched, all right.

806
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:36,950
These shirts here are for Junior.

807
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:42,255
He can't be looking like a scarecrow
when he's looking for a job.

808
01:03:43,934 --> 01:03:47,062
- About ready to go, honey?
- No.

809
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:51,036
I wanna talk to Mama
for a little while, okay?

810
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:53,505
- Get some rest.
- I will.

811
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:13,756
Ray.

812
01:04:18,235 --> 01:04:20,169
Mama...

813
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:23,132
...Antoine told me
about the tombstone.

814
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:27,005
I'm not having it.
It'll say, "Rest in peace."

815
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:31,405
Which is 11 letters.
We get a two-dollar credit.

816
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:35,140
That's it, Mama. Period.
That's it.

817
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:40,490
All right.

818
01:04:43,393 --> 01:04:45,224
I understand that.

819
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:52,168
Well, that's all I had to say.
I'll let you go to bed.

820
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:56,667
Can you take a minute with me?

821
01:04:56,907 --> 01:04:59,375
- Sure.
- I wanna show you something.

822
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:00,871
Help me up.

823
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:18,626
Do you remember these?

824
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:22,289
Can't say I do.

825
01:05:22,499 --> 01:05:24,865
These were my embroidery scissors.

826
01:05:25,268 --> 01:05:28,567
My mother gave them to me
after I married your father.

827
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:32,672
I used to do all kinds of
things with these.

828
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:37,278
Did all the quilts.
Made clothes for you kids.

829
01:05:37,514 --> 01:05:40,950
Just... everything.

830
01:05:41,852 --> 01:05:44,343
Then one day they just
up and disappeared.

831
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:48,352
I looked everywhere,
but I never saw them again.

832
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:51,117
And yesterday...

833
01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:54,158
...when I was getting
Bud's cuff links...

834
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:57,929
...I found them in with his stuff.

835
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:04,732
I have no idea why he wanted them.

836
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:08,638
Never even thought to
ask him where they were.

837
01:06:08,912 --> 01:06:11,506
Isn't that funny?

838
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:14,784
I guess so, Mama.

839
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:20,521
It came to me that your father
is like these scissors.

840
01:06:20,824 --> 01:06:23,793
We didn't lose him on Wednesday.

841
01:06:23,994 --> 01:06:28,488
We lost your father a long,
long time ago.

842
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,959
Did you love him?

843
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:38,333
Did you love him?

844
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:44,842
Sometimes I loved him,
sometimes I hated him.

845
01:06:45,115 --> 01:06:47,174
Ray?

846
01:06:47,484 --> 01:06:50,510
Sometime...

847
01:06:50,787 --> 01:06:53,381
...when you least expect it...

848
01:06:53,657 --> 01:06:57,559
...a little door is gonna
open up inside of you.

849
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:04,532
And you'll feel just fine about
however you feel about your daddy.

850
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:09,194
'Cause you'll be right.
You'll be able to accept it.

851
01:07:27,657 --> 01:07:31,218
- Good night, Mama. See you tomorrow.
- All right.

852
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,534
Mama?

853
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:46,204
You sure about that door?

854
01:07:46,776 --> 01:07:48,607
Absolutely positive.

855
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:59,118
- Lf you need...
- Lucille.

856
01:08:00,023 --> 01:08:04,119
Don't try to fix it.
Let's let it go for a while.

857
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:12,821
Come on, Delightful.
Royce! Wake up.

858
01:09:13,363 --> 01:09:14,990
Where's Aunt Raynelle?

859
01:09:15,532 --> 01:09:20,367
Why? Are you in a hurry, Devil?
Delightful, come on.

860
01:09:20,637 --> 01:09:22,764
No. None of that today.

861
01:09:23,006 --> 01:09:27,534
And take that gold thing
out your mouth. Delightful, come on!

862
01:09:57,373 --> 01:09:59,841
I can't find my good pants!

863
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,191
Where's the preacher, Mama?

864
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,095
What's the rush, Ray?

865
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:03,135
Antoine and Merline are charging me
by the hour.

866
01:11:03,473 --> 01:11:05,600
Ray, go on and find him.

867
01:11:07,377 --> 01:11:08,639
Sit tight.

868
01:11:36,306 --> 01:11:38,570
- What's he doing?
- He'll be right out.

869
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:41,801
I'm going broke waiting for him.

870
01:11:42,078 --> 01:11:46,572
Last night the reverend and
Mrs. Hooker went out...

871
01:11:46,816 --> 01:11:49,580
...to that new Mexican restaurant.

872
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:51,184
- So what?
- Well...

873
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:54,618
...today he's having
intestinal difficulty.

874
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:57,452
I swear I'll go in there myself...

875
01:11:57,694 --> 01:12:00,754
...'cause I've had
enough of this shit.

876
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:03,089
That is a poor choice of words.

877
01:12:03,466 --> 01:12:07,527
My nerves are getting worse
and I don't have my pills.

878
01:12:10,607 --> 01:12:13,303
Just take a deep breath. Come on.

879
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:16,611
- I'm really trying.
- I know.

880
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:22,276
I'll take care of it, okay?

881
01:12:30,994 --> 01:12:32,655
Reverend?

882
01:12:34,197 --> 01:12:37,325
Shouldn't be much longer.
You okay?

883
01:12:38,835 --> 01:12:42,066
- When this thing gonna start?
- In a minute!

884
01:12:45,141 --> 01:12:46,233
Charisse?

885
01:12:46,509 --> 01:12:48,409
Honey, where's Junior?

886
01:12:49,746 --> 01:12:53,238
I don't know. Ask Bernice Talbert.

887
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,415
Girl, you so funny.
Do you want some gum?

888
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,557
No, thank you.

889
01:13:03,826 --> 01:13:07,523
I bring sweet gum
to weddings and funerals.

890
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:14,333
I think the rhythm of it
sort of lulls me.

891
01:13:14,537 --> 01:13:17,335
Helps my mind wander.

892
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:21,407
You know what I think about?

893
01:13:23,212 --> 01:13:25,237
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

894
01:13:25,782 --> 01:13:27,545
I think about my life.

895
01:13:27,784 --> 01:13:30,912
How every night I tuck in
my precious boy...

896
01:13:31,387 --> 01:13:33,878
...in my $800,000 home.

897
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:38,217
And crawl into my king-size bed,
where I lie and wonder...

898
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:41,259
...where the hell my husband is.

899
01:13:42,065 --> 01:13:43,930
Sure you don't want any?

900
01:13:48,905 --> 01:13:51,305
Why don't you leave him?

901
01:13:51,574 --> 01:13:53,269
And go where?

902
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,969
I have everything I want.

903
01:13:56,379 --> 01:13:57,641
If he loved you...

904
01:13:57,981 --> 01:14:02,645
Then I might be forced
to love him back.

905
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:08,051
Do you love Junior?

906
01:14:08,925 --> 01:14:11,826
Do you want him back?

907
01:14:12,895 --> 01:14:14,920
You don't have to answer.

908
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:17,928
Just let the gum take its effect.

909
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:20,095
It'll come to you.

910
01:14:26,843 --> 01:14:29,004
It's hot in here.

911
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:34,841
- That's nice!
- Thank you, girl.

912
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:08,949
First of all, let me apologize
for my tardiness.

913
01:15:09,252 --> 01:15:12,050
I had to call the gas company.

914
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:16,190
There seemed to be a problem
with one of the pipes.

915
01:15:16,959 --> 01:15:18,517
Shall we pray?

916
01:15:26,969 --> 01:15:29,631
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

917
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:33,000
For God's sake, sit down.

918
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:34,506
Sit down!

919
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:41,442
Heavenly Father...

920
01:15:42,385 --> 01:15:44,615
...we come here today...

921
01:15:44,821 --> 01:15:46,379
...with heavy hearts.

922
01:15:47,557 --> 01:15:49,889
I'm sorry.

923
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:55,057
As we mark with sadness
the passing...

924
01:15:55,264 --> 01:16:00,065
...of our dearly departed brother
Bud Slocumb.

925
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:07,770
Give us peace...

926
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:10,570
...in our hearts today, Lord.

927
01:16:11,414 --> 01:16:13,075
Guide us...

928
01:16:13,382 --> 01:16:16,977
...through the long night
and help us see...

929
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:21,020
Okay, you need to handle this.
I'm gonna move.

930
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:27,026
Now, Father...

931
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:32,029
...let that tomorrow be a
better day than yesterday was.

932
01:16:32,635 --> 01:16:35,001
For what is yesterday...

933
01:16:35,972 --> 01:16:41,035
...but the tomorrow that we
could not face the day before.

934
01:16:53,089 --> 01:16:56,684
But God, with your help...

935
01:16:59,195 --> 01:17:02,289
...we will face it like
we did today.

936
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:06,862
Tomorrow and all of our
days to come...

937
01:17:07,436 --> 01:17:11,304
...till you call us home
to be with you...

938
01:17:12,108 --> 01:17:15,271
...and our beloved brother Bud.

939
01:17:15,845 --> 01:17:20,873
- Can everybody say, "Amen"?
- Amen.

940
01:17:22,118 --> 01:17:23,949
I love you, Charisse.

941
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:29,055
Can't you understand that?

942
01:17:36,632 --> 01:17:38,691
I love you.

943
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:50,675
I guess you thought you could
waltz in here...

944
01:17:51,247 --> 01:17:53,875
...with a Whizzy Cream
and fix everything.

945
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:59,252
And I would forget
about all the pain and humiliation.

946
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:00,780
Huh, Junior?

947
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:04,084
Now, it's your daddy's funeral, okay?

948
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:08,854
I'm just supposed to welcome
you with open arms and say:

949
01:18:09,065 --> 01:18:11,033
"I forgive you, Junior"?

950
01:18:12,935 --> 01:18:14,061
Well, yeah.

951
01:18:21,777 --> 01:18:23,540
I love you, Junior!

952
01:18:23,779 --> 01:18:26,509
- I love you!
- Why'd you do me like that?

953
01:18:26,716 --> 01:18:28,741
I didn't mean to, baby!

954
01:18:28,951 --> 01:18:31,317
- Why'd you do that?
- I'm sorry!

955
01:18:31,621 --> 01:18:35,557
That's it! That's it!
Get in the pew!

956
01:18:36,626 --> 01:18:39,117
Get your ass in that pew!

957
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:43,230
Stay there if you want to live!

958
01:18:43,532 --> 01:18:45,159
That's it!

959
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:49,201
Now...

960
01:18:49,472 --> 01:18:51,372
...is there anything else...

961
01:18:51,641 --> 01:18:56,408
...anyone here needs to say or do?

962
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:03,750
Does everybody here have
everything they need?

963
01:19:05,187 --> 01:19:08,520
We may be
the laughingstock around here.

964
01:19:08,891 --> 01:19:11,155
But for once in our lives...

965
01:19:11,394 --> 01:19:13,828
...we're gonna do something...

966
01:19:14,497 --> 01:19:16,590
...with class and dignity.

967
01:19:20,936 --> 01:19:23,734
All right, reverend.

968
01:19:24,006 --> 01:19:25,405
Take it away.

969
01:19:28,944 --> 01:19:30,878
Okay, there, Ray.

970
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:36,008
Ain't God good?

971
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,048
I did not know...

972
01:19:41,257 --> 01:19:43,521
...Brother Slocumb well.

973
01:19:44,527 --> 01:19:46,358
But to me...

974
01:19:46,896 --> 01:19:50,297
...he seemed to be a quiet man.

975
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:53,467
A man of inner strengths...

976
01:19:53,736 --> 01:19:56,432
...and I believe that...

977
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:05,875
I believe if he was here today...

978
01:20:06,882 --> 01:20:09,976
...he'd send a message to his family.

979
01:20:10,286 --> 01:20:14,916
And the message would simply say...

980
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:30,202
Would you all mind excusing me
for just a minute?

981
01:20:30,406 --> 01:20:32,306
I'm gonna be right back.

982
01:20:36,078 --> 01:20:38,478
Don't send it over here!

983
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:53,491
Daddy always was a man of few words.

984
01:20:59,835 --> 01:21:03,293
- I don't care if we have kids.
- What?

985
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:07,042
It doesn't matter,
you're all I ever wanted.

986
01:21:10,946 --> 01:21:12,937
I hate to stop the party...

987
01:21:13,149 --> 01:21:16,949
...but how we gonna have a funeral
with no pastor?

988
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:20,280
Sit down. We don't need no pastor.

989
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:24,516
We've got Ray Bud. Go up there
and say a few things.

990
01:21:25,161 --> 01:21:27,721
Feel that little door opening.

991
01:21:27,997 --> 01:21:30,795
- Say it for us.
- Go on, baby.

992
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:50,511
Aunt Marguerite, do you wanna?

993
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,083
Thank you, Ray.

994
01:21:53,322 --> 01:21:58,021
There seems to be a passage
here in Isaiah that says...

995
01:21:58,694 --> 01:22:03,154
Hey, Ray? What about
that part from Psalms?

996
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:07,898
The part that goes, "When my father
and mother forsake me...

997
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:10,162
...the Lord will take me up.

998
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:14,504
Teach me thy way,
and lead me in a plain path.

999
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:18,043
Let me see the goodness of the Lord.

1000
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:23,182
Be of good courage,
and he shall strengthen thine heart.

1001
01:22:23,919 --> 01:22:26,217
Wait, I say, on the Lord."

1002
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:34,459
You got it, Ray.

1003
01:22:40,603 --> 01:22:43,197
That was real good, Royce.

1004
01:22:52,248 --> 01:22:55,706
I guess this is the part
where I'm supposed to...

1005
01:22:56,619 --> 01:23:00,817
...tell you all how great a man
my father was.

1006
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:03,058
I'm not gonna do that.

1007
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:06,724
I'm gonna do what he would've done.

1008
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:10,962
I'm gonna tell the truth.

1009
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:14,567
My father was a hard man.

1010
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:18,834
I'm not judging him,
that's just the facts.

1011
01:23:19,141 --> 01:23:23,601
Daddy wasn't real big on soft words.

1012
01:23:25,748 --> 01:23:28,478
And I know he wasn't good at...

1013
01:23:29,351 --> 01:23:33,014
...expressing what he felt
in his heart.

1014
01:23:33,956 --> 01:23:39,360
So as I stand here today,
I can tell you this.

1015
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:46,593
If I could do one thing
all over again...

1016
01:23:47,937 --> 01:23:53,273
...I'd tell my father I loved him...

1017
01:23:53,676 --> 01:23:58,704
...instead of waiting my whole life
for him to tell me first.

1018
01:24:02,518 --> 01:24:05,544
So as you step up here today...

1019
01:24:06,689 --> 01:24:09,453
...to say your last goodbye...

1020
01:24:09,992 --> 01:24:13,291
...to Woodrow "Bud" Slocumb...

1021
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:18,431
...I hope you'll open
the door to your heart.

1022
01:24:18,968 --> 01:24:21,334
I hope you'll take time...

1023
01:24:21,537 --> 01:24:25,633
...to consider the folks
that mean something to you.

1024
01:24:26,275 --> 01:24:29,301
Because people don't last forever.

1025
01:24:30,346 --> 01:24:32,541
They really don't.

1026
01:24:35,618 --> 01:24:38,178
And letting a person in...

1027
01:24:38,454 --> 01:24:42,948
...is the most cherished treasure
this life has to offer.

1028
01:24:44,627 --> 01:24:47,619
So I'm proud to stand here today...

1029
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:50,526
...and say that in his own way...

1030
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:53,530
...my father taught me that.

1031
01:24:56,505 --> 01:25:01,670
- Amen.
- Amen.

1032
01:25:07,383 --> 01:25:09,180
We are...

1033
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:13,782
...truly lucky to have with us today...

1034
01:25:14,256 --> 01:25:16,417
...a member of our family.

1035
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:20,618
Mrs. Charisse Marie Slocumb...

1036
01:25:20,896 --> 01:25:25,629
...who will honor her
father-in-law in song.

1037
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:27,732
Charisse.

1038
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:34,407
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Ray.

1039
01:25:36,078 --> 01:25:39,377
I haven't sang in a long time.

1040
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:46,685
I know y'all know this,
so sing along.

1041
01:27:46,842 --> 01:27:51,006
You were wonderful.
Baby, that was good!

1042
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:58,381
Daddy, I know you always
worried about me and the kids...

1043
01:27:58,654 --> 01:28:01,817
...but you don't have to
anymore, because...

1044
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:06,825
Charisse's going into the music
business. I'll be her manager.

1045
01:28:07,029 --> 01:28:08,894
- You think?
- Oh, I think.

1046
01:28:17,272 --> 01:28:21,538
- Sure does look peaceful, don't he?
- Yes, he does.

1047
01:28:21,743 --> 01:28:27,010
Daddy Bud, in about seven
and half months from now...

1048
01:28:27,216 --> 01:28:29,946
...you might get a little surprise.

1049
01:28:30,686 --> 01:28:33,086
We'll name a boy Buddy Ray...

1050
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:36,222
...and we'll name a girl Budeisha Joy.

1051
01:28:36,425 --> 01:28:39,553
But don't get your hopes
up too high yet.

1052
01:28:40,462 --> 01:28:42,054
Bye, Daddy.

1053
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:56,936
Royce, when I go, just
put me in a pine box.

1054
01:28:57,145 --> 01:29:01,479
Don't spend any money on me.
Not that you'll have any.

1055
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:04,378
Mama, when the time comes...

1056
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:09,080
...try to point your toes down like
Uncle Bud did.

1057
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:12,758
So I can bury you with a pile driver.

1058
01:29:12,995 --> 01:29:17,295
- You're a demon, Royce.
- I'm your demon, Mama.

1059
01:29:40,822 --> 01:29:42,289
Royce, come on...

1060
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:45,653
No, you didn't!

1061
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,336
If it starts to get crowded up there,
save a place for me.

1062
01:29:57,673 --> 01:29:59,698
But not too soon.

1063
01:30:23,000 --> 01:34:37,000
