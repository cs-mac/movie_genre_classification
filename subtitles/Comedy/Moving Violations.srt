the problem?

00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:55,722
          No matter what I do,

          in the morning.

00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:01,728
    - Have you had your pump
     checked lately?      
    - By a specialist.    

398
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,730
I should probably take    
another look at it        

399
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:06,098

00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:13,072
             I don't believe so.

00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:15,341
You should probably       
have a major overhaul,    

404
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:17,744

     - Several times a day.

406
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:22,148
   Hmm, that's no good,   
   is it?                 

407
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,050
Every place you go, you leave
those unsightly puddles.

Gets so your neighbors cringe
when they see you pulling 
up their driveway.

  - What about your rear end?
  - What about it?        

410
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:34,860

I'll tell you what,       
I am up to here in my work

413
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:42,302
but what I will do--      
I'll lube it up.          

414
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:44,270
I'll get inside there     
and root around            

415
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:46,205
and find out what         
the problem is.           

416
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:49,108
I have the best tool in town.
Trust me, I'll do         
a thorough job.           

417
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,477
    - Mm-hmm.             
    - Meanwhile, here's what
     I'd like you to do-- 

418
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:53,680
about an hour before you        
get going in the morning, 

419
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:56,449
drain out your water,     
flush it out of there     
completely,               

420
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:59,519
take in a lot of oil,     
then grease up that back end,

421
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:03,255
get out on the highway    
and go as fast as you 
can for 9 or 10 miles.     

422
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:05,257
           - Really?      
           - Yes.         

423
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:07,327
              No-- no one has
              ever said this
              to me before.

424
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:09,662
As I say,                 
I am a professional.      

425
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:12,097
I can lick any rear end problem
you can bring me.         

426

In fact, I do a lot       
of celebrities too.       

427

I reamed out Roger Moore. 

428
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:20,005
He was totally satisfied. 
As a matter of fact,

           Let's go.

             someplace and talk?

437
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:47,032
Um, yeah, I've been       
thinking about it.        

438
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:49,736
        - It's probably   
         a good idea.     
        - Yeah.           

439

       ( Clears Throat )  

440
00:25:57,444 --> 00:26:00,446
              Hey, look,  
              I think we got off
              on the wrong foot,

441
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:02,448
               and I'm sorry.

442
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,084
        Why don't we shake hands
        and we'll wipe    
        the slate clean?  

443
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,355
Now, look, mister--

     gone too far.        
    - Shut up.

        My career.

  And now I'm gonna       
  screw things up for you.

1237
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:21,487
      That's what's great 
       about this force.  

1238
01:20:21,489 --> 01:20:23,489
        You ask for help  
        and you get it.   

1239
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:26,542
           They got a whole army

      asking everyone,    

1247

        "Where the hell

           Virginia!      

1250

01:21:31,324 --> 01:21:33,443
        That's him.

   You have an appointment?!
  Do you have an appointment?

 Do you have an--? Do you have
        an appointment?   

1258
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,225
Sir, I got something here 
you should read.          

1259
01:21:49,227 --> 01:21:52,362
      I'll call you back. 
     Some people just came
        into my office.   

1260

      officer Halik       

1262
01:21:59,237 --> 01:22:01,537
and Judge Henderson's plan
to bilk the citizens      

1263
01:22:01,539 --> 01:22:03,573
and the city              
of thousands of dollars.  

1264
01:22:03,575 --> 01:22:06,442
             That's a lie.
             This man is accused
             of armed robbery.

1265
01:22:06,444 --> 01:22:08,294
  - That's the fatigue jacket
   the hold-up man wore.  
  - What?!                

1266
01:22:08,296 --> 01:22:09,795
                   I remember

1267
01:22:09,797 --> 01:22:11,964
       - I'm positive.    
        This is the man.  
       - That's a lie.    

1268
01:22:11,966 --> 01:22:13,699
      - That's a lie, sir.
      - Arrest this man.

               ( Crying ) 
               No, no, no.

1270
01:22:15,403 --> 01:22:17,736
      Judge Henderson, you have
      a lot of explaining to do.

1271
01:22:19,522 --> 01:22:22,741
How about a little        
strip search, and we'll   
call this whole thing even?

1272
01:22:22,743 --> 01:22:24,744
        - <i>Arrest her!</i>     
        - I'm innocent.   

1273
01:22:24,746 --> 01:22:26,545
       I'm innocent, sir! 
        Tell him, Nedra!  

1274
01:22:26,547 --> 01:22:29,214
  - Tell him!             
  - Shut up. I've got enough
   problems of my own.    

1275
01:22:29,216 --> 01:22:31,083
         How about a little
         dinner and some eating?

1276
01:22:31,085 --> 01:22:34,020
          How about a little
          "Hide the nightstick"?
          How about--     

1277
01:22:34,022 --> 01:22:36,773
     It is a great pleasure
     to present each of you
      with a certificate, 

1278
01:22:36,775 --> 01:22:39,308
                which certifies
                you've completed
                your course

1279
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:41,310
           of driver's education
           traffic school.

1280

       - Congratulations.

1282
01:22:48,386 --> 01:22:50,386
          People, just    
       a little reminder, 

1283
01:22:50,388 --> 01:22:53,322
          there'll be     
    a post-graduation party
      at my place tonight.

1284
01:22:53,324 --> 01:22:55,691
     I expect you all there
       promptly at 8:00.

      biblical character. 
           Thank you.     

1286
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:01,630
    - Woman: This is great.
    - Man: That's good.   

1287
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,935
  So now that             
  we've graduated,        

1288
01:23:05,937 --> 01:23:07,937
       will I ever        
       see you again?     

1289
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:10,372
                I think so.
                I'm moving in
                with you.

          Oh, you are?    
         - Mm-hmm.        

1291
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:15,210
              That's right.
              So why don't you
              just follow me

1292
01:23:15,212 --> 01:23:18,414
    in your truck to my place
    so we can pick up my things?

1293
01:23:24,721 --> 01:23:27,556
So maybe we could stop    
at the space lab          

1294
01:23:27,558 --> 01:23:30,026
   and go for a little twirl?

         ( Door Opens )   

1296
01:23:33,832 --> 01:23:36,182
All right, Emma Jean,     
let's get going.          

1297
01:23:36,184 --> 01:23:39,351
    - Let me drive, Loretta.
    - Why should I let    
     you drive?           

1298
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:42,088
      - Because you       
       can't see a thing. 
      - Don't be silly,   

1299
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:44,423
           I can see      
           as well as you can.
