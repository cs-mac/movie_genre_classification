00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:25,447
<i>so I decided to call.</i>

472
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,311
<i>Hey, I just got my quarter back!</i>

473
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,591
Oh, hey! It's Big Red.
Where's the Tubster?

474
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:47,436
- Can't wait to see him on the dance floor.
- Yeah, watch all that lard shakin' around.

475
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:56,181
Angus is gonna blow your bonehead face
off the dance floor.

476
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,825
When Angus dances with Melissa,
she's never gonna look back.

477
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,270
Angus can dance?

478
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,715
Yeah.

479
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,459
- That sucks.
- Yeah, really.

480
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:26,504
What if he's really good?
I mean, all you can do is that... white thing.

481
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:27,349
Shut up.

482
00:38:27,994 --> 00:38:31,394
What are you gonna do
if he can really dance? I mean...

483
00:38:31,538 --> 00:38:32,338
I don't know.

484
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:35,983
Look, somethin', okay?

485
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:43,028
Hey! What are you doing?
Let me go! C'mon!

486
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:44,372
Thanks for the tip.

487
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:48,917
RICK: You know, uh, you really shouldn't
hang around the halls without a pass.

488
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,362
- ANDY: Hey, keep this to yourself, squat.
- MIKE: Yeah.

489
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:55,283
RICK: Let's get out of here.

490
00:38:55,706 --> 00:38:56,506
'Kay.

491
00:39:03,351 --> 00:39:06,551
and they like chained him up, and they cut off
his arms and legs so he can't get away

492
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:10,996
and they took like this metal rod, and they stick it
into his head and it like sucks out his brains

493
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:15,641
and replaces it with like this green glowing ooze
so they can take over his body

494
00:39:24,985 --> 00:39:27,885
Wedberg! Hit the showers!

495
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,130
I've got a note from my doctor.

496
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,775
It's upside down, Wedberg.

497
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,719
This is from your father.

498
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,664
- He's a doctor.
- He's a dentist.

499
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:48,909
I have sore gums.

500
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:51,453
Shower!

501
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:54,098
Every day I go through this with this kid.

502
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:58,443
Hey, my shirt's gone!

503
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:01,887
You're a real asshole, Sanford!

504
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:03,732
- Did I say that?
- Hey, a tough guy.

505
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:06,177
ANDY: Oh, hey! It's the butterball king.

506
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:07,522
Just give him his shirt back.

507
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:08,566
Troy.

508
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:10,611
Oh, you lose your shirt, man?

509
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:12,656
Like you didn't know.

510
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Listen, Angus, I'd lend you my shirt but I'm afraid
it's not gonna fit. It might rip on you.

511
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:21,945
That's 'cause it's cheap like your mother.

512
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,790
Hey! What are you doing? Let me go!

513
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:34,934
Let me go! Let me go! Quit it! Ow!

514
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:41,179
I want my shirt back.

515
00:40:41,224 --> 00:40:42,324
Maybe you lost it.

516
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:46,468
Don't hit him, Angus. You'll get expelled.

517
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,813
If he still wants to go to the dance
after all of this, good for him.

518
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:52,358
You know, he won fair and square.

519
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:53,603
I know you set it up.

520
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:57,047
Hey, it was a little joke, okay?

521
00:40:57,092 --> 00:41:00,692
You should be thanking me. I mean, this is
the chance you've wanted your whole life, right?

522
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:03,737
Now it's yours.
I'm the one getting the shaft this time.

523
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:06,181
Melissa's bitching my ear off
because she's gotta dance with you.

524
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:11,826
Hey, you know, I mean,
nothing personal.

525
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,071
TROY: C'mon, let me out.

526
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,611
You know, it doesn't
smell so bad in here.

527
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:30,315
Easy, easy.

528
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,160
He took my underwear too.

529
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:50,105
Screw Rick. And screw the dance.
He's just gonna do something to you.

530
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,450
So what are you gonna do?

531
00:41:58,194 --> 00:42:00,094
Go to class without underwear.

532
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:02,539
Oh! Careful!

533
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:15,884
- Angus.
- What?

534
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:19,228
I think I know what Rick
did with your underwear.

535
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:36,473
- Do you believe it?
- No!

536
00:42:37,718 --> 00:42:40,518
You're underwear's almost
as big as the flag.

537
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,262
Get that down from there.

538
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:53,707
Angus, look at it this way:
what could be worse?

539
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:40,452
She didn't see it! She didn't see it!
She didn't see it!

540
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:43,496
I don't believe it! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

541
00:43:45,341 --> 00:43:46,641
Hey, Melissa!

542
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,686
That's what you call
gettin' a slice of the ol' dick pie!

543
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:03,031
Everyone's gone, Angus.
Can we go now?

544
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,675
<i>I was pissed.</i>

545
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,120
<i>That was my favorite pair of underwear.</i>

546
00:44:10,765 --> 00:44:13,065
Maybe no one knew they were yours.

547
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:17,009
It's not like you had your name
printed all over them or anything.

548
00:44:22,654 --> 00:44:26,254
Hey, man, I'm not the one who
put your underwear on the flagpole!

549
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,999
That was your underwear, Angus? (Laughs)

550
00:44:43,543 --> 00:44:46,343
Troy, I'm...

551
00:44:53,988 --> 00:44:55,388
Whatever.

552
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:11,233
What?

553
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:18,377
The dance is comin' up and, uh,
we really wanna play a little joke on Angus

554
00:45:18,422 --> 00:45:20,422
but we're kind of stumped on what it should be.

555
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:22,367
We're hoping maybe you could help us.

556
00:45:22,812 --> 00:45:26,912
Give me a break! What do you want?

557
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:30,956
- Just give us something we can use to, uh...
- To embarrass him in front of the whole school!

558
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:32,001
Forget it!

559
00:45:34,646 --> 00:45:35,946
Ow!

560
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,390
Look, it's... it's just for fun, man.

561
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:40,135
I'm not gonna do it.

562
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,680
Okay. Let's go.

563
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:47,524
Hey! Let me go! Let me go!

564
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:49,769
Help!

565
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:54,014
Ow!

566
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:55,359
C'mon, man. Let's go.

567
00:46:00,303 --> 00:46:03,703
See? See, tough guy?
I mean, what the hell is your problem?

568
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,048
Look, just help us out with this.

569
00:46:05,093 --> 00:46:06,693
I don't have anything!

570
00:46:06,737 --> 00:46:10,237
Then get something, all right?
This is important, you understand?

571
00:46:14,382 --> 00:46:15,382
Understand?

572
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:19,527
- I'm still thinking.
- Absolutely.

573
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,971
- What are you doing here?
- Did you take your pill?

574
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:25,516
Inside coat pocket.

575
00:46:27,461 --> 00:46:29,761
- Angus
- What?

576
00:46:30,105 --> 00:46:31,805
You're making me nervous.

577
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,450
This is my last day as a bachelor.
I need my peace.

578
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,795
- What is your problem?
- Rick Sanford!

579
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,240
- Did you break that kid's nose again?
- I'm thinkin' about it!

580
00:46:45,484 --> 00:46:48,284
What happens when another
quarterback comes along?

581
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:50,301
Because there's always gonna be
another quarterback, Angus.

582
00:46:50,629 --> 00:46:53,429
I'm sick and tired of hearing that!
People suck, Grandpa.

583
00:46:54,174 --> 00:46:58,374
I could knock this guy out with one punch.
Forget it, you don't understsand.

584
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,718
I don't understand?

585
00:47:03,763 --> 00:47:07,163
That's why I want to go to Jefferson, okay?
Because no one will know who I am.

586
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:10,008
And if nobody knows who I am,
I don't have to be Angus Bethune.

587
00:47:11,052 --> 00:47:12,752
I can't go to this dance.

588
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:14,297
You're a coward if you don't.

589
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:20,042
I can't dance, I can't talk to girls,
but I can smash Rick Sanford's face in!

590
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:22,086
You're a coward if you do.

591
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:26,231
You think I don't understand? You think I don't know
what people are saying about April and me?

592
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,376
She's too young? I'm too old?

593
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:30,021
Screw 'em!

594
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:31,465
You don't see me punchin' anybody out.

595
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,510
Because you're a fool, Grandpa,
and I'm tired of being one.

596
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,655
I'm a fool, hmm?

597
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:44,899
Well, April doesn't think so
and I'm getting married tomorrow.

598
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:49,544
And I don't care what the hell anybody says about it.
I need my moment, dammit!

599
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:59,689
<i>[ Music playing: "Funny Face" by The Muffs ]</i>

600
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:28,933
Why isn't this working?

601
00:48:29,378 --> 00:48:34,978
- Angus!
- Mom, I'm working on my science project.

602
00:48:35,723 --> 00:48:38,523
Oh, okay. You're not wearing this tie.

603
00:48:38,568 --> 00:48:40,868
What are you talking about?
That's a beautiful tie.

604
00:48:40,912 --> 00:48:42,712
It's a clip-on!

605
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:45,957
Meg, you're making everybody crazy!

606
00:48:46,002 --> 00:48:50,702
You're on me all the time about the wedding.
You're all over Angus about this science school crap!

607
00:48:50,746 --> 00:48:53,246
- It's not crap, Dad.
- It's crap!

608
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,291
It's a wonderful opportunity for him.

609
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:59,436
It's a chance to excel at something
he's really great at. It's good for Angus.

610
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,480
It's also an opportunity for him to go someplace where
he doesn't have to account for who his parents are.

611
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:05,925
Screw what other people think.

612
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:08,470
- You don't have to prove anything.
- Neither does he.

613
00:49:08,514 --> 00:49:14,114
This dance thing is a prank. I don't want him
humiliated in front of the whole school.

614
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,559
You know what you're doing?
You're not giving the boy credit for being strong.

615
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:20,904
Do you know every time he
sits down in the cafeteria

616
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:23,549
the kids jump up and pretend
they're being thrown off the bench?

617
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:25,993
They call him Bigfoot.

618
00:49:26,238 --> 00:49:29,538
- He never mentioned that to me.
- He never told me, either.

619
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:32,183
You know what they did
with his underwear?

620
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,927
They ran it up the flagpole
just to humiliate him.

621
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:39,272
And he gets up and he goes

how strong my son is. I know.

- Is this a friend?
- Mom...

631
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:07,019
- I just wanted to say hi.
- Hi.

632
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:11,464
Look, Angus, your interview is on the 22nd.
You know how soon that is?

633
00:51:11,508 --> 00:51:14,408
I know when the 22nd is, Mom. Trust me.

It's the day of the dance.

The interview is at three. You've got plenty of time

Angus, um, could you help me for a second?

Um, I want you to tell me the truth.

Either way.

I can't believe I'm so nervous.

- One and four.
- Oh.

656

I've got it all written down in this book, Angus.

I promise I won't forget. Really, I promise.

658
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:29,926
Would you please tell my husband-to-be
that his future wife is almost ready?

659
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:44,470
Grandpa, April says she's almost ready.

660

Good, good. I tell you,
I feel like a kid! Ha ha!

Look at me. I'm nervous!
I'm... I'm sweating!

662
00:53:56,205 --> 00:54:00,805
Got a little secret for you:
I feel like it's my wedding day.

663
00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:03,149
This is your wedding day, Grandpa.

664
00:54:03,194 --> 00:54:05,894
How's April look? She wouldn't
let me see her wedding dress.

665
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:12,039
I tell you, that woman! Every time I look
at her I get the worst pain

666
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:15,183
right in the middle of my stomach. You know?

667
00:54:15,828 --> 00:54:17,428
It's a great feeling.

668
00:54:18,773 --> 00:54:19,673
I know.

669
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:24,017
These things are so stupid. Your mother
wouldn't let me wear a clip-on.

670
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,162
Nobody can tell.

671
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:33,007
- I'm sorry about the other day.
- I forgot about it.

672
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:35,651
- I really feel bad.
- It's forgotten.

673

I didn't mean what I said.

674

I'm telling you I don't even remember it.
I can't remember anything, not a goddamn thing!

675
00:54:53,886 --> 00:54:55,886
Grandpa, I was a jerk.

676
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:06,030
I'm glad you're marrying April.
You should see her.

677
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:13,675
I think she really loves you a lot.
But still, it takes a lot of guts.

678

You've got balls, Grandpa. More than me.

You don't understand.

682
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:37,098
He's smart and handsome, even decent.
But he's not brave.

683
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:40,443
No, listen to me.

684
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:50,988
Superman is indestructible and you can't
be brave if you're indestructible.

685
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:54,432
It's people like you and your mother.

686
00:55:55,377 --> 00:56:02,077
People who are different
and can be crushed and know it.

I'm not brave, Grandpa.

689
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:26,611
I'm so afraid of going to this dance.
And I know everybody thinks I'm stupid for trying.

I'm not crazy.

695
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:59,379
I know she's not gonna be struck blind and
ask me to take her home from the dance or anything.

696
00:57:01,124 --> 00:57:03,924
But it's the only chance I'll have.

697
00:57:06,269 --> 00:57:11,169
And I guess I just want one moment with her.

698
00:57:12,314 --> 00:57:13,714
Just one.

699

You're looking at it.

762
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:43,674
Is this a joke, Mr. Bethune?

763
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:47,519
No. I'm hoping to prove that
within every normal system,

764
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:51,040
there exists an abberation.
Something different.

01:05:51,563 --> 01:05:54,363
- The Chaos Theory.
- The Bethune Theory.

766
01:05:56,008 --> 01:05:57,408
Your hypothesis?

767
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:01,853
When a small abnormal element is
forced into a larger normal system,

768
01:06:01,897 --> 01:06:05,797
the element will either be rejected or destroyed.

769
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:07,442
Obviously.

770
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:11,387
But it doesn't have to be that way if...

771
01:06:12,032 --> 01:06:13,132
If...?

772
01:06:13,476 --> 01:06:15,876
If the element is brave.

773
01:06:17,221 --> 01:06:18,621
"Brave"?

774
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:21,466
If the element can hold out long enough,

775
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:26,039
 and face the torment of the system
until the system's energy is depleted,

776
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:30,510
if the element can look the system in the eye
and say, "I'm still here, asshole!"
