1
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:55,743
Mickey, have a pee before you go!
In the toilet this time!

2
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:09,298
Mickey! Move!

3
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:13,886
- Don't sit on the back of the sofa.
- What? Whoa! Ow!

4
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,262
Time to get a move on, OK?

5
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:18,265
Scottish Granddad and his puppies
are waiting for us.

6
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,102
Let me take this, let me...
Oh! Jeez, what the...

7
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,439
Oh, for f... What's that?

8
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:26,690
That's Eric.

9
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:28,817
- Eric?
- Yes.

10
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,445
He wants to come
to Scotland with us, too.

11
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,822
Thing is, Eric's a wee bit heavy, and...

12
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:37,576
Hang on, there's a... What's this?

13
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:41,580
- That's Norman.
- That's... half a breeze block.

14
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:45,376
- How did you even pick that up?
- I can't sleep without Norman.

15
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,544
You sleep with... with this in your bed?

16
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:51,507
No, that would be stupid!
He goes at the bottom of my bed

17
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:54,593
to make sure the bad ones
don't come in.

18
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:58,806
- So there's bad stones and good stones?
- Yeah. Like in real life.

19
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,391
Sure.

20
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:05,813
That's our car alarm!

21
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,315
Oh, for God's sake!

22
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:14,196
For Odin!

23
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:23,163
Bloody thing.

24
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,542
Bugger off.

25
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:36,135
No, I'm sorry, darling,
we can't take Norman to Scotland.

26
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,637
- Or Eric.
- Right, then I'm gonna hold my breath.

27
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:41,932
No, no, no. Don't do that.
Jess, Jess. Jess, stop it. Jess. Jess.

28
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,104
OK, they can come. Look?
Fine. See? They're coming, it's OK.

29
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:49,231
Look, look, in they go, in the bag.

30
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,026
So her best friends are stones now?

31
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:54,111
Not all of them.
Some of them are bricks.

32
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:57,448
Well, have you, you know,
have you spoken to anyone about it?

33
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:00,284
What, like a geologist?
Oh, this thing hates me.

34
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:03,746
I'm just saying that...
obsessive collecting,

35
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,498
it's rather abnormal behaviour
for a child to...

36
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,625
She's behaving abnormally?
I wonder why.

37
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,461
For Christ's sake, Abi, just get...

38
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:13,464
- OK, sweetie?
- Everything all right?

39
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:16,050
- I need a list.
- A list?

40
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:19,803
Yeah, of the lies we're going to tell.
In case I forget one.

41
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:25,601
- That is a clove hitch.
- It's just a list would be helpful.

42
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:29,355
- Has anyone seen my house keys?
- Oh, M25 slow moving between...

43
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,607
- Keys, keys, keys.
...well, everywhere.

44
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,609
It's just a list would be
really helpful.

45
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:36,820
It's really very simple.
It's Granddad's 75th birthday party

46
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:40,407
and we don't want to upset him
because he's been a bit poorly...

47
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,910
He's getting better now.

48
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:45,454
Yes, but...

49
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:47,915
Oh, Jesus H Christ!

50
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,918
Mummy, you're not supposed to
shout Jesus's name like that.

51
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:53,879
No, that's all right,
it's cos I'm asking for His help.

52
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:55,923
- To stop the car alarm?
- Yep.

53
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:58,967
See? Thank you, Jesus.

54
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:00,928
Come on, all aboard!

55
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:05,641
- Enemies of Odin!
- I want the window seat!

56
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:08,602
- Have you got your key?
- No, I gave you my key, remember?

57
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:12,564
- Yeah. Yep.
- We can't leave the house unlocked.

58
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,483
- No, I'm aware of that.
- Don't start.

59
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,985
Nobody's starting.
You supervise the little ones.

60
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,155
- Well, where are your keys?
- Erm, I think someone's hidden them.

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,033
Oh, for f...
We've got to address this.

62
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:25,119
- How many times?
- Don't start!

63
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,329
- We're not starting, darling.
- OK.

64
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,748
- Well, where are you going?
- Lucy.

65
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,084
She won't let me
put her seat belt on.

66
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:34,545
- I don't like it!
- We've got to put it on.

67
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:37,506
She'll be through the window screen
and cut into tiny pieces.

68
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,093
Yes, thank you, Mickey.
Ooh, I've got a good idea.

69
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:45,222
Why don't we ask Eric
if he knows how to put?

70
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,975
- It is Norman, Mum.
- Norman, as I was saying,

71
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:51,228
why don't we ask Norman if
he knows how to put a seat belt on?

72
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:52,646
He's a breeze block!

73
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:56,442
And he doesn't have arms! How could he
possibly put my seat belt on?

74
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:58,026
Right, I'm putting it on.

75
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,987
It's the stone
that needs the seat belt.

76
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,157
Because if we brake hard,
it will go straight through your head

77
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:07,077
or Daddy's head if he's driving...
for your information.

78
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:12,207
Oh, hi, Lucy.
Erm, Abi's managed to lose her keys

79
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,543
and I need to lock up,
so could I borrow the spare?

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,379
If you could just let me have...

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,094
- Oh.
- Oh, no, Luce, it's fine.

82
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:25,721
Oh, right.

83
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,187
So, you're off on your travels.

84
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:34,897
Yeah, to visit my dad.

85
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,441
- You're driving all the way to Scotland?
- That's right.

86
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,193
- Together?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:40,861
700...

88
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:43,197
We cannot drive to the Highlands
in one day.

89
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,324
I told Gavin
we'd be there tonight.

90
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:48,285
- We haven't got a cat's hope in hell.
- We can share the driving.

91
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:50,913
- What, with Jenson Button?
- Please don't argue.

92
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,749
We're not arguing, darling,
we're discussing.

93
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,918
This is how it starts.
You start discussing,

94
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:59,087
- then end up shouting and screaming.
- Then the policeman comes.

95
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:02,466
That was just a misunderstanding,
sweetheart.

96
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,220
Sometimes when grown-ups
discuss things... very loudly,

97
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:09,097
- people get the wrong ideas.
- He let me play with his Taser.

98
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:12,184
- Well, he didn't let you.
- That was another misunderstanding.

99
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:16,563
- He didn't say I couldn't.
- Did the electricity feel nice, Daddy?

100
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:19,399
No, not nice.

101
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:25,781
So, we're all going to have
a holiday together?

102
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,659
Yeah, yep. It'll be lovely, won't it?

103
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:33,872
Does that mean that Daddy's
gonna come and live with us again?

104
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:37,209
Well, no, sweetheart,
we've been through all this, haven't we?

105
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:38,877
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey?

106
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:42,339
And the important thing to remember
is that Mummy and Daddy...

107
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,299
both love you very much,

108
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:49,930
but then sometimes a mummy and a daddy
reach a point where,

109
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:51,265
well, things change,

110
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,435
and then one of them finds that
they don't really love the other one

111
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,064
like they used to,
and then, maybe because of that,

112
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:02,651
the other one... makes a mistake.

113
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,111
Like Lloyd's dad?

114
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:07,322
Well, that was actually
quite a big mistake.

115
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,783
Running over Lloyd's mum with his car,
that was...

116
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:11,827
No, I'm talking about
a smaller mistake

117
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:14,538
where, well, one of them does
something that is...

118
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:17,249
a little bit silly and selfish
with someone at work,

119
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,710
so they find themselves
having rows and...

120
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:24,047
getting cross, and then one of them
goes to someone called a solicitor

121
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:26,925
and sometimes,
if one of them is getting angry...

122
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,429
one of them tells his solicitor
to keep saying no to everything

123
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:32,639
even though they know
they're in the wrong

124
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,266
which means that even though

125
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,603
a mummy and daddy love
the children very, very much...

126
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:39,104
and always will...

127
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:41,189
they just keep getting crosser and...

128
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:44,234
crosser, until the mummy and daddy
start blaming each other

129
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,446
for every tiny thing even though
none of this would be happening

130
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,407
if the other one had just
listened to him in the first place.

131
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,034
- Dad?
- Yes, Mickey?

132
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:54,995
These are a bit tight.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,170
Dad! Dad! We've brought
your 12 o'clock pills!

134
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:06,965
Oh, chase me round the loch
on water skis, why don't you?

135
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,261
Only, you left them behind!
And, er... and it's 12 o'clock!

136
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,889
Come on, you beauty! Come on!

137
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:16,808
With his heart,
he is supposed to stay calm.

138
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:20,562
I mean, how can anybody get
so worked up about fishing?

139
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,606
Oh, Jesus!

140
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,566
Never think of looking left and right?

141
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:25,651
Dad!

142
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:34,034
- Is this Scotland?
- No, darling, this is Watford.

143
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:38,330
When Daddy wakes up,
are you gonna go, "I told you so,"

144
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:40,290
cos of the traffic congestion?

145
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,125
No, darling.

146
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:48,215
She's not gonna say, "I told you so."

147
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,758
Jess! What did you do that for?

148
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:51,343
It's rude to wake someone up.

149
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:54,596
- That's right.
- A million thousand...

150
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:59,810
Oh, God. Look at this lot.

151
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:03,438
Leave it.

152
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:05,607
Abi's phone.

153
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:10,612
Hang on. It's Leon.

154
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:12,531
I'll call him back.

155
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:14,825
She'll call you back.

156
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:17,828
I feel car sick. Can I sit in the front?

157
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:20,414
Next time we stop, sweetie.
If we're allowed to.

158
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,208
In 50 metres, turn right.

159
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,711
We can't bloody turn right,
there's no right turn.

160
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:29,423
- She can't hear you. She's a robot.
- She is the most overpriced...

161
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:30,757
Can we change the voice?

162
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:33,135
Can we have it in Italian
like we did last time?

163
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,011
No. That's how we ended up in Ipswich.

164
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:38,515
But we can have it in African language,
say for example,

165
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:41,017
- either like Chad or?
- Chad isn't a language.

166
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:43,395
Zimbabwe or Bahamas.

167
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,314
Or even Israelian.

168
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,150
Oh, God, it's Gavin.

169
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,402
Accept it,
we are not gonna get there tonight.

170
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:53,029
The traffic always gets better
after Leeds. Hi, Gavin.

171
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,323
Tell him we won't make it today.

172
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,909
Yeah, it is safe me talking to you.
Abi's driving.

173
00:09:57,994 --> 00:09:59,369
Tell him.

174
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:01,788
Because in England we let women drive.

175
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:04,291
Tell him.

176
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:08,003
No, we will make it tonight,
just probably quite late. OK.

177
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,589
OK, bye. Bye-bye.

178
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:38,325
Hello, I wondered
if Sir Donald was in. Thank you.

179
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,160
We've got three bulimics.

180
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:43,497
Do you think we should put them next
to the buffet or a long way from it?

181
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:47,042
I think near the toilet's
probably more important.

182
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:49,419
Er, do you know, I think Doreen...

183
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:53,507
er, she'd be more comfortable
away from the top table.

184
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:56,927
Maybe we should let your dad decide,
because she is one of his oldest...

185
00:10:57,011 --> 00:11:00,889
- Sir Donald. Gavin. Yeah.
...friends.

186
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:02,891
Gavin.

187
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,601
Gavin McLeod. Yeah.

188
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,895
I hear you got a hole-in-one
at the 13th.

189
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:27,290
Well, he won't be bothering us again.

190
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:30,418
Just wait there, kids.

191
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:34,297
I like being sick,
it's like being a fountain.

192
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:36,633
- I was sickest most.
- No, I was.

193
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:39,427
Thanks for stopping for the night.

194
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,347
I just want to get there
as soon as possible.

195
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:44,349
- No, I know.
- His T-shirt.

196
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,726
His T-shirt was full of vomit
because of me.

197
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:47,894
Listen, Doug...

198
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,526
It's a draw. You both
produced an equal amount of sick.

199
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,528
But I still won.

200
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:01,491
Er... why are we putting ourselves
through all this?

201
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:04,369
Maybe we should just
tell your dad the truth.

202
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,621
No, no, it's too big a risk.

203
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,249
It could really upset him,
the idea of us splitting.

204
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:12,168
Please, Abi.

205
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,422
He can't have long, let's just...

206
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:17,257
Let's just let him have his party.

207
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:31,229
Oh, Jesus Christ. No, no, no.

208
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:49,414
Lottie, no one's gonna ask you if
Mum and me are living in the same house.

209
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:51,833
Is there anything else
you've not told me?

210
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,084
No.

211
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:57,756
- Why are you writing that down?
- So you can't say you didn't say it.

212
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:02,761
OK. Kids, just to remind...
Mickey, stop playing chip Jenga.

213
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:06,181
Just to remind everyone, what we're
saying is, when we get to Scotland,

214
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:11,144
nobody is to tell anyone that Mum and me
are living in different houses, OK?

215
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,940
Can we tell them that you walked in
while the headmistress was doing a poo?

216
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,358
It's not really...

217
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:19,277
Can we tell them about tadpoles
turning into frogs?

218
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:22,155
Absolutely. I think that'd be
an excellent conversation.

219
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,741
That's a much better
topic of conversation.

220
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:28,536
So as long as we're all agreed,
none of us mention anything about this.

221
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:31,331
I wasn't gonna mention it anyway.
It's boring.

222
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,166
- Exactly.
- It's lying.

223
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,669
It's... It's not lying, it's not.

224
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:38,838
It's not...
It's not mentioning something.

225
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:41,758
What if someone asks,
"Are your mum and dad getting divorced?"

226
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:46,096
You're visiting your granddad,
not going on The Jeremy Kyle Show.

227
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:51,601
I hope we get another sunset
tonight. Last night was fantastic.

228
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:55,230
It's the volcanic dust in the air
refracting the low-level sunlight.

229
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:57,732
Really?

230
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,568
I thought it was those new pills
the doctor's got me on.

231
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,488
Must give you
a couple of packets of the blue ones.

232
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:07,450
You can take them to school, sell them
to your friends, make a tidy wee profit.

233
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,872
Play something.

234
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,425
Nah, nah, nah.
Play the proper stuff.

235
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:26,594
You know you like it.
And you've got to cut loose, Kenny.

236
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,054
Go mental.

237
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,975
Dad says I need to concentrate
on my exam pieces.

238
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:21,483
In 50 metres, turn right.

239
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,194
Right.

240
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:26,780
Oh, Jesus.

241
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:28,656
Why didn't you wake me?

242
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,367
- You said it was rude.
- Not while I'm driving.

243
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:32,452
What's happening?

244
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:35,747
Daddy didn't like me
driving when he was asleep.

245
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:38,374
- What? You were asleep?
- Is this Scotland?

246
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,794
Do you mean you actually fell asleep?

247
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,337
Not really.

248
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:45,548
- Yeah, these are the Highlands.
- How high are the Highlands?

249
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:48,802
- Were you sleeping?
- High. Higher than the Lowlands.

250
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,470
Did you fall asleep?

251
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:30,885
Puppies!

252
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:35,306
Forgotten the way to Scotland then?

253
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,952
So, Mickey, belated birthday present.

254
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,454
I expect you can guess what it is.

255
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,415
Is it a bicycle?

256
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:03,835
Is it a... joke cushion that
stabs you in the bottom?

257
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:05,628
- No, it is not.
- Is it a cow pie?

258
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:06,921
Granddad!

259
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:09,632
- Happy birthday!
- Hello, darling.

260
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:12,927
Hey, Dad.

261
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:15,597
- Gordie.
- Hello.

262
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,933
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks very much.

263
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:22,103
- How's things, Dad?
- Fine, fine, good.

264
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:23,646
And how's things with you?

265
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,273
- Fine.
- Brilliant, brilliant.

266
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:26,482
I mean, super. More than.

267
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,277
- Brilliant, tremendous.
- It is more fun actually. Fun.

268
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,279
- Yeah.
- Isn't it? Yeah.

269
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:34,365
- Really, really, really good.
- Right.

270
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:37,619
- I did you a birthday card, Granddad.
- Oh, thanks, Lottie.

271
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:39,829
She's got something of your mother.

272
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:42,457
- Can he not play with that?
- Oh, Mickey!

273
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,211
Sorry, I just wanted to show Granddad
the badger in the revolving doors

274
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:47,670
and the nun with two heads.

275
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:49,672
Nobody wants to see
a nun with two heads.

276
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:52,217
- I do.
- That computer's not for kids.

277
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,969
All the terminals are connected.
It's a...

278
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:56,971
- Synergised system.
- That's right.

279
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:59,557
You know, the whole house
is virtually wireless.

280
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:02,018
It's, well, more than an iCloud, it's...

281
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:04,229
iFog?

282
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:06,648
It's an intelligent house.

283
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:09,150
Is it as intelligent

284
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:10,818
as a squid?

285
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:14,030
- As a squid?
- Cos it can fit through a hole.

286
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:15,490
It's intelligent in a way...

287
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,660
- Can it draw a leopard?
- What?

288
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:19,994
And can it do cartwheels?

289
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:22,872
If this house is more intelligent
than you...

290
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,667
- Mickey.
- This system cost a lot of money.

291
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,878
Well, it doesn't always mean
it's intelligent if...

292
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:30,880
- It cost loads of money.
- Yeah.

293
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,840
You're not explaining it at all well.

294
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:38,012
I think we should take you to
the headmaster of your place

295
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:40,223
- because...
- It's an intelligent house, OK?

296
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:44,018
You know, it's connected.

297
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:45,353
Let there be light.

298
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:51,192
Now then, clan of McLeod,
if you'll excuse me...

299
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:52,944
Hmm.

300
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,115
Where are the keys?
They were there a moment ago.

301
00:18:57,199 --> 00:19:00,118
Who could have taken them?

302
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:01,286
I don't know.

303
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:04,414
Magpies?

304
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:09,711
Magpies?

305
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:14,924
This is my domain.
Only special people come here.

306
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:18,219
After you, my dear.

307
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:22,890
Ta-dah!

308
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:37,613
Jess? This is insane!
I only asked you where the keys were.

309
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,908
Jessie, Jessie, just breathe,
take a big, big breath.

310
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,410
A big, deep breath.

311
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,746
- She holds her breath?
- Yeah.

312
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,082
Ah, well.
She can't do herself too much harm, eh?

313
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,085
Well, actually...

314
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,588
Till she blacks out? Unconscious?

315
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:58,301
That's quite extreme, isn't it?
To hold your breath that long.

316
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:01,429
Well, she can always become
a pearl diver.

317
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:07,518
Where's Sir Donald gone?

318
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:11,439
Have you noticed anything odd
about Doug and Abi?

319
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:14,150
Hey, what have you done to that helmet?

320
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:15,985
I took the horns off it.

321
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,654
London manners. Eh?

322
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:23,117
Doug can't control them.
And as for her...

323
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,454
That's what happens when
you marry someone too clever.

324
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:33,127
That's me when I was 20.

325
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:34,962
Only my skin was a little less orange.

326
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,301
Is that you with the monkey?

327
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:43,179
Yeah, that was my 30th birthday
in Northern Rhodesia.

328
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:46,516
- We were looking for silver.
- Kneel before mighty Odin!

329
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:49,185
Do you not get birthdays
after you're 75?

330
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:50,311
What?

331
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:54,690
Dad said to Mum it's going to be
Granddad's last birthday. I heard him.

332
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,819
Ooh, Blu-Tack. Can I have this?

333
00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:01,322
Sure. Tell you what, why don't you
go check out on the puppies?

334
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:03,324
- See if they're OK.
- Sure.

335
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,159
I'm building a big...

336
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,251
You've heard of cancer?

337
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:15,711
Well, I've got that.

338
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,672
But you will get better.

339
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:21,050
Well, actually, no,
they can't make me any better

340
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:23,177
and the treatments
they've been giving me

341
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,513
have been putting
a terrible strain on my heart.

342
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:34,522
But right now,
right this second, I feel brilliant.

343
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:40,194
- What is this?
- It's my notebook.

344
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:43,448
You know, Lottie,

345
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:47,243
a lot of life doesn't look very good
written down.

346
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:51,205
So, cousin Kenneth
is the one who took the keys?

347
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,874
Yeah, isn't he a naughty boy?

348
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,460
And where did cousin Kenneth
put the keys?

349
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:00,631
Right.

350
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:02,550
- Lost something?
- No.

351
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:04,886
Ready for football?

352
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,556
Leon, hi. No, still very keen.

353
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,142
- Oh, nice header.
- Yeah, all right. Yeah.

354
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:13,060
- It's mine!
- Hey?

355
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:14,562
Oh! There you go.

356
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:16,898
Maybe your parents just lied
to protect you.

357
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,984
- Do you ever lie?
- Well, I've told lots of lies.

358
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:22,320
Lots and lots of lies.
I always lied to policemen

359
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:24,238
who said, "What speed were you going?"

360
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:27,283
I say, "30mph," when I was clearly
doing much faster than that.

361
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:31,787
And I don't care.

362
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:39,170
Sometimes, if your intentions
are good, it's OK to lie.

363
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:42,757
And if you don't like
someone's food at someone's house,

364
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,926
and you say, "This is great,"
even though...

365
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:48,179
That's what you do. You don't say,
"My God, I think I'm gonna vomit here."

366
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:53,768
What you're saying is,
it's OK to lie to some people sometimes?

367
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:55,353
Yeah, it's also good fun.

368
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:56,854
For instance...

369
00:22:58,106 --> 00:23:00,942
Maybe we can find him in here.
George Judd.

370
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:03,861
There he is, that's him there.

371
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:07,281
When he told him there was an
elephant leech clinging to his bollocks,

372
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:09,450
he got such a fright,
he completely fainted.

373
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:14,872
- Is that you?
- No, I'm the wee one.

374
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:16,791
So who's that?

375
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:19,335
Er...

376
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:23,965
How could I forget?

377
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:27,134
Dip me in vinegar
and call me a fish supper.

378
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:30,388
I have here
a chocolate model of the Alps.

379
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:32,348
Ta-dah!

380
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,853
Here he comes,
weaving his magic.

381
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,981
And he's clean through...

382
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:42,567
- Foul!
- Come on! I hardly touched you!

383
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:44,360
And so it begins.

384
00:23:44,486 --> 00:23:46,362
Kenneth, your ball!

385
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:48,823
- Oh, for Christ's sake!
- Gavin!

386
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:51,367
What is wrong with you?
For crying out loud.

387
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:54,495
- Mickey, this is your ball!
- I'm a Berserker!

388
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,539
Will you stop being a Berserker? Ow!

389
00:23:56,665 --> 00:23:58,833
- And England are rattled.
- I'm not England.

390
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,544
You're so English,
you're practically French.

391
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,548
Oh, no! I think I see
a marauding Berserker!

392
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:07,425
Help!

393
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:09,760
- That would have killed me.
- I've killed you!

394
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:12,388
But I moved my heart
to the other side, thank goodness.

395
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:14,557
- You can't.
- You can when you're Scottish.

396
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:17,560
- You've got a movable heart.
- You're dead.

397
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:19,687
Jess! Kick it in the goal!

398
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,188
Kenneth, you spaz!

399
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,190
Gavin, please!

400
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:26,736
Get the bloody ball!
She's gonna score!

401
00:24:30,198 --> 00:24:32,742
Jess! Oh, God. Jess, are you OK?

402
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,369
- Darling!
- I'm so sorry, Jess.

403
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:36,871
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

404
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,373
- I'm really, really sorry.
- It wasn't your fault.

405
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,792
No, no, it was his fault.

406
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:43,794
- Is she OK?
- No harm done.

407
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,755
Come on, let's get you some ice cream.

408
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,829
I'll make you a hot chocolate...

409
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:52,428
I'm just gonna take this penalty.

410
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:56,265
- Did you really play for Scotland?
- Aye, I did.

411
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:57,892
Just the once, against Cyprus.

412
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:00,227
- Did you score?
- I certainly did.

413
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:04,732
A cracking header into the top corner...
of my own net.

414
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,818
That's probably why
you only played once.

415
00:25:07,944 --> 00:25:11,572
Somebody going to go in goal?
Gavin?

416
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:13,908
So how are you feeling?

417
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:17,745
Really, really pissed off
with this dying thing.

418
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:21,832
Terribly, utterly
100 percent pissed off.

419
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,334
Like millions before me.

420
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:28,589
You could look on the bright side.
You dodged Alzheimer's.

421
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:31,258
Gavin!

422
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,763
This morning I was thinking of Doug
when he was Jess's age.

423
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:39,266
I used to tickle him
and he'd go, "No, no, no!"

424
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:42,812
Then when I was finished,
he'd go, "More, more, more, more!"

425
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:46,107
Which sums up
exactly how I feel about living.

426
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:50,111
One-all.

427
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:54,615
Right, time, everybody!
Margaret!

428
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:58,953
The keys are back

429
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:00,996
Hm-hmm.

430
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:05,334
Uncle Gavin, are you rich?
This place is enormous.

431
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,129
Er, no, no, no. Comfortable.

432
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:12,508
This isn't actually...
This is owned by my company, not by me,

433
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:14,385
so I use, like, a tax wrapper...

434
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:17,221
- Are you like a tax man?
- No. No, no...

435
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:18,848
What is your actual job then?

436
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:21,308
Well, er, I have an interest
in a fund...

437
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:24,979
- So you're a banker?
- No. No, I work with banks...

438
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:28,357
- Dad said bankers are scum.
- Hmm!

439
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:32,069
Did I say? Well...
I might have done, yeah.

440
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:34,822
Would you ever have thought
that you would own this house

441
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:36,866
if you were not a banker?

442
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:39,744
- I'm not a banker.
- Yeah, Gav. What is your actual job?

443
00:26:39,828 --> 00:26:42,371
- What is scum?
- I use money to make money.

444
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:45,166
- That doesn't make sense.
- Margaret!

445
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,877
When will we ever get
this answer out of you?

446
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm giving you the answer, you're not...

447
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:52,923
- Is it gonna be the 12th of July?
- Enough.

448
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,552
- I'm a short seller.
- You sell shorts?

449
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:58,220
A short sailor?

450
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:02,558
Not a short sailor, a short seller.

451
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:06,270
Your friends, do they sell shoes,
socks, hairpieces?

452
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:08,522
What sort of millionaire are you?

453
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:11,442
OK, I've got lots of money, OK?
Lots of money!

454
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:14,862
I've got shares, I've got property,
I've got gold.

455
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:17,114
I've got lots of money! Can we just?

456
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,949
Margaret!

457
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:35,633
If this has got another two minutes,
we're gonna get obese.

458
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:39,220
I can even feel myself
getting obese now.

459
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:42,765
Sweetie, that's...

460
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:45,142
This is killing me.

461
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:47,478
Right now,
do you realise this is killing me?

462
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:51,106
You should have told me about Granddad.

463
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:52,942
- I'm sorry.
- Shh, shh, shh!

464
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:57,238
You and Mum need to stop lying.

465
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:07,623
If you didn't lie so much,
maybe you'd still be together.

466
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:09,333
Bravo!

467
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:12,753
And maybe Mum wouldn't be on the phone
to her solicitor all night

468
00:28:12,796 --> 00:28:15,422
banging on about breaches
and leave to remove.

469
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:16,507
More!

470
00:28:20,804 --> 00:28:22,596
Wasn't that great?

471
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:12,229
Sorry, I shouldn't have...

472
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:15,316
Kenneth, darling, it's fine.

473
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,528
This, it's just something women do
when they get a bit older.

474
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:21,530
It's perfectly normal.

475
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:24,700
Just letting off a bit of steam.

476
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:29,371
Is this about the... incident?

477
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:34,501
Incident? What incident?

478
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:37,379
Mum, it's on YouTube.

479
00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:52,853
- Leave to remove?
- I need the toilet.

480
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:59,276
- Doug!
- I texted my solicitor.

481
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:00,486
I'm dying for a pee.

482
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,155
You're planning to take
my children away, aren't you?

483
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:07,326
- Somewhere that's...
- Newcastle, OK? Newcastle, right?

484
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:11,163
- Now is not the time to talk about it.
- When is a good time?

485
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:12,748
When I'm not on the toilet.

486
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:18,045
- Newcastle?
- Yeah.

487
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:21,090
You're seriously gonna take my children
to live in Newcastle?

488
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:24,009
- I'm thinking about it.
- Have you told the kids?

489
00:30:24,094 --> 00:30:27,429
- You found this?
- Yeah.

490
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:31,392
I think it's a king's brooch
because it's got the Tree of Life on it.

491
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,852
Is it true you're a Viking?
Cos Dad said you were.

492
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:37,731
Oh, yeah. University Hospital
were doing DNA tests

493
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:40,067
and wanted volunteers.

494
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:42,653
And seeing as they were
forever taking my blood anyway,

495
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:45,197
seems I'm 84 percent Viking.

496
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:49,368
That's most of me.

497
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,921
Look, come on. I thought we agreed
that this weekend was about your dad

498
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:04,174
and we'd put all personal issues
on hold. We agreed, didn't we?

499
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,343
- Yeah.
- Then unlock the bloody door.

500
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:08,846
- How would I see the kids?
- You'd come to Newcastle.

501
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,431
- What?
- A few hours on the train.

502
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:12,766
- Four hours at least.
- Three hours 12 minutes.

503
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:15,394
- Nearly seven hours there and back.
- Will you let me out?

504
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:17,604
- Every weekend, seven hours?
- I'd like to leave, please.

505
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:20,274
Weekends would be much worse,
they do engineering work.

506
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,484
I'd spend my life
on a bus replacement service.

507
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:24,695
- Let me out.
- You're doing this out of revenge.

508
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,823
Either behave in a mature
and adult way

509
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:30,451
or I scream "rape" out of this window.

510
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:33,620
Oh, not that again.

511
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:36,999
Why did you pull
the horns off your helmet?

512
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,209
Cos it's historically incorrect.

513
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:41,253
Cos Viking helmets didn't have horns.

514
00:31:41,337 --> 00:31:44,798
Ah, but they didn't have two holes
in them there and there, did they?

515
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:47,092
They did if they fell off a cliff
onto a stag.

516
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:48,510
I never thought of that.

517
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:50,095
What if somebody threw a spear?

518
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,182
It could have gone through the side
and out the other side.

519
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:56,435
But that would hit the helmet though,
wouldn't it?

520
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:59,730
You know,
my favourite Norse god is Odin.

521
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,356
Is it? Why's that?

522
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:06,653
Because he's got these, erm, ravens
called Memory and something else.

523
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:07,780
What did they do?

524
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:12,117
- They're ravens.
- And that's a job, is it?

525
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:13,827
- They're really dangerous.
- Ooh.

526
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:16,288
- I pray to him sometimes.
- You pray to Odin?

527
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:20,125
Yeah. He roams the world
testing people's hospitality.

528
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:24,338
Well, in the mortal world,
we have a word for that. "Scrounging."

529
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:34,139
Happy 75th birthday.

530
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:42,773
They're fine.

531
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:45,692
And they don't live
in different houses by the way.

532
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,168
I'll be running,
er, well, all the important stuff.

533
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:06,338
Margaret, I've got you
on the flowers, the food,

534
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:09,383
the signage and the cloakroom.
Er, and the taxis.

535
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,389
And the photographer. Doug, I need you
to set up the marquee for the band.

536
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,307
Hello. And set up the tables.

537
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:20,602
Kenneth is on parking and conage.

538
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:22,729
I'm going to West Beach
with Dad and the kids.

539
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:26,316
I think not.
214 guests we've got coming.

540
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:28,569
- 214?
- 215.

541
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:30,477
Patsy Cameron found a
man on the internet.

542
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:31,096
Too late.

543
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:33,532
Although Jimmy Cazerotto's
stuck in New Zealand.

544
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:35,826
- Dad can't manage the kids.
- I'm not senile.

545
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,037
No, but what if...
Mickey, put the puppy back.

546
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:43,542
- Dad, it is your birthday...
- And this is how I'd like to spend it.

547
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:46,086
And we don't want to upset him. Do we?

548
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:49,840
- We'll be back by seven.
- Well, no, you need to be back bef...

549
00:33:49,924 --> 00:33:52,259
So that's agreed then.
I'll take my mobile.

550
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:53,760
- Come on, kids.
- Yes!

551
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,137
But, Dad...!

552
00:33:57,056 --> 00:33:59,933
Gordie, are you sure
you're up... for this?

553
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,769
It's... Margaret said
your medications make you feel...

554
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:04,980
I'm giving the medications
a rest today.

555
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:06,356
Oh, well, is that a good...

556
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:09,067
No need to worry,
I've carried out a risk assessment.

557
00:34:10,612 --> 00:34:12,988
No, I haven't. It's a joke.

558
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:16,700
Remember jokes?

559
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:39,097
Hey!

560
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:45,687
Are you not stopping to say hello,
you miserable old bastard?

561
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:48,273
Jesus, Doreen,
can you not mind your language?

562
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:49,566
They're only weans.

563
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:50,984
She's got animals!

564
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,945
What's the matter with you?

565
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:56,448
I'm just saying go easy on the swearing.

566
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:58,992
They're from London,
everybody swears in London.

567
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:01,745
Mum and Dad swear all the time.

568
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:04,456
- Well, maybe so, but...
- Mum used the c-word.

569
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,251
- And the other ones.
- OK, but...

570
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:13,548
"Tell that to your poxy effing c-word
of a solicitor, you effing b-word."

571
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:17,552
She thought I was in the garden

572
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:20,973
but I was in the toilet
peeing very quietly

573
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:24,726
by aiming for the side of the toilet
but not the water.

574
00:35:27,397 --> 00:35:28,647
Though I did miss a bit.

575
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:31,358
- Right.
- She's got goats!

576
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:33,068
I'm coming!

577
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:36,238
And pigs!

578
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:43,328
I wonder what's in here.

579
00:35:45,248 --> 00:35:47,874
- Shall we have a look?
- Whoa, look at the size of him!

580
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:51,586
- They're like massive chickens.
- They look like meerkats.

581
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:55,590
Only with no arms.

582
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,051
I'm gonna race one.

583
00:35:58,177 --> 00:36:00,929
You've got an escapee
charging about like a loony

584
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:03,181
- down by the burn.
- That'll be Wiggins.

585
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:08,103
- How are you feeling today?
- Oh, I'm fine.

586
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:09,604
It's one of my good days.

587
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:13,317
You are such a crap actor.

588
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:20,407
Come on! Call yourselves ostriches?
I'm a lion! Come on! Race me!

589
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:24,619
So this came out of
a ostrich's bottom?

590
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,413
That's why they're so bad tempered.

591
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:29,708
Could you get an ostrich egg
and push it back up its bottom?

592
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:31,793
No, I don't think so.

593
00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:34,629
Because you'd have to
hold the ostrich still

594
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,882
and nobody's gonna volunteer for that.

595
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:39,718
I reckon you could get it
halfway up the crack.

596
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:40,844
You could push it up.

597
00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:43,805
If you caught it halfway,
you think you could push it back up?

598
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,932
- Yeah.
- Next time one's going to lay,

599
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:48,852
- I'll get in touch with you.
- One little push like...

600
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:52,272
- Like a volleyball.
- Right.

601
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:57,235
Look, I know your mum and dad
are going through a difficult time.

602
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,738
So you know what's happening to them?

603
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:02,991
- I put two and two together.
- So you know they're getting divorced?

604
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:08,497
Well, no, I didn't know that.

605
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:16,380
Look, Lottie, people sometimes change
but they still love you, both of them.

606
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:19,174
You'll see.
They'll muddle through this eventually.

607
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:22,177
- Dad had an affair.
- Right, er...

608
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:25,180
With a Paralympic athlete lady
with one foot.

609
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:28,183
I probably don't need to know
all the details.

610
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,239
Do you look after
the ostriches on your own?

611
00:37:31,312 --> 00:37:33,730
- No, Morag helps me.
- Who's Morag?

612
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:36,149
- She's my girlfriend.
- Oh, for goodness' sake!

613
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:38,110
- What?
- You could have said "friend".

614
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:41,363
Girlfriend? Boys have girlfriends.

615
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:43,323
Now we have to explain the whole thing.

616
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:46,451
Fine, I'll explain.

617
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:50,872
- Do you know what a lesbian is?
- Is it someone from Lesbia?

618
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:55,877
That's right, Mickey.
I am from the magical kingdom of Lesbia.

619
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:58,880
You're just gonna confuse them
even more!

620
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:03,969
Margaret! There's a wrong
apostrophe on the toilet signage!

621
00:38:05,555 --> 00:38:09,391
- What the hell? Newcastle.
- It's a vibrant, growing city

622
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:14,104
- with a great... public transport hub.
- But it's hundreds of miles...

623
00:38:14,188 --> 00:38:16,314
The Tyne is the best salmon river
in Britain

624
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:18,483
and otters have been seen in Gateshead.

625
00:38:18,526 --> 00:38:20,569
- Abi, listen.
- There's lots of castles.

626
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:23,488
- Eh?
- Around Newcastle. Kids love castles.

627
00:38:23,573 --> 00:38:26,533
Bamburgh Castle, Dunstanburgh,
Alnwick, Holy Island.

628
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:28,869
Is this job
with the Newcastle tourist board?

629
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:32,706
- I'm just saying, it's...
- Abi, please.

630
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:34,541
Please. Don't take them away.

631
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:40,464
Margaret needs this heather.

632
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:43,550
Margaret?

633
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:45,177
Margaret!

634
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:00,442
Granddad,
your mobile's turned off.

635
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:02,319
Aye, that's the way I like it.

636
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:06,531
And the batteries are dead,
just to make sure.

637
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:10,285
Oh, just look at that. Look at it.

638
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:18,168
Bless you.

639
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:20,629
Lovely manners.

640
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:22,464
Can we drive for a bit?

641
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:25,217
- Don't be stupid. Kids can't...
- Yes, you can drive.

642
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:26,551
Mickey, toot the horn.

643
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:29,054
Jess, you're the look-out.

644
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:31,515
Stick your head out
and shout, "Look out!"

645
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,518
- Look out!
- Lottie, you steer.

646
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:37,729
What? But I... I can't...

647
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:42,734
When I press this pedal on the floor
that makes it go, then it's down to you.

648
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:45,487
What? But I...

649
00:39:45,571 --> 00:39:47,614
Left a bit. Left a bit.

650
00:39:47,698 --> 00:39:50,116
But it's not allowed.
I'm ten, I'm not insured.

651
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:52,410
I don't care.

652
00:39:52,495 --> 00:39:54,955
That's good. Left, left. That's lovely.

653
00:39:56,707 --> 00:40:00,001
- I don't think that...
- You need to live more and think less.

654
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:03,964
- More right, more right! Oh!
- Lottie!

655
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:06,591
Well done!
I've been trying to hit that for years.

656
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:10,345
- What did it say?
- It said "Do not let children drive".

657
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:13,306
♪ Oh, Mother, can I go out to swim?

658
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:15,433

Whoo-hoo!

669
00:40:35,538 --> 00:40:38,164
We might see a killer whale.

670
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:03,607
Don't go on those rocks!

671
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:09,529
I found a pebble!

672
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:26,004
Is it nice being a lesbian?

673
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:29,132
What the hell are you asking me for?

674
00:41:29,216 --> 00:41:32,594
I suppose it must be, otherwise
they wouldn't be one, would they?

675
00:41:35,056 --> 00:41:37,557
How do people know what they are?

676
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:39,726
Well, they just kind of find out.

677
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,938
We all find out eventually what we are.
Then the world has to lump it.

678
00:41:45,775 --> 00:41:48,068
Can lesbians make babies?

679
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:50,654
Er... Well, er...

680
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:53,490
Why don't you nip over there
and get some wood for the fire

681
00:41:53,574 --> 00:41:57,494
- at the old Viking burial mound?
- That's a Viking burial mound?

682
00:41:57,578 --> 00:41:58,953
Yeah. So they say.

683
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:02,248
That's where I found the brooch.

684
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:12,801
Are you OK, Granddad?

685
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:15,345
Aye, indigestion, princess.

686
00:42:16,305 --> 00:42:18,682
I've had it all my life.
Don't chew enough.

687
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:22,060
Granddad! I've lost my pebble.

688
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:25,772
Right.

689
00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:33,488
I'll race you! Look out for jellyfish.

690
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:41,162
- Is this official?
- Is what official?

691
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:43,665
What it says on this rock.

692
00:42:43,749 --> 00:42:47,252
"Keep off. F and G's beach."

693
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:49,671
Oh, God.

694
00:42:49,755 --> 00:42:51,756
I carved that.

695
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:56,219
Well, I helped. Actually I didn't do
all that much, I was only small.

696
00:42:56,303 --> 00:42:59,848
- Frazer did most of it.
- Who's Frazer?

697
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:02,016
He was my big brother.
He died in the war.

698
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:03,268
In Afghanistan?

699
00:43:03,352 --> 00:43:06,187
No, he was fighting
a very stupid man called Hitler

700
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:08,398
who wanted to take everybody's land.

701
00:43:08,482 --> 00:43:13,069
- Like Monopoly?
- Aye, just like Monopoly.

702
00:43:13,154 --> 00:43:14,738
Except with more screaming.

703
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:17,615
Anyway, Frazer used to bring me here,

704
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,743
- taught me how to swim.
- How did he die?

705
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:21,494
Someone made a terrible mistake.

706
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,122
A pilot thought
Frazer's platoon were Germans.

707
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:25,623
Where's he buried?

708
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:28,293
He isn't buried anywhere.

709
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:30,378
I know about dying.

710
00:43:30,463 --> 00:43:31,880
Right.

711
00:43:31,964 --> 00:43:37,761
Cos of Bambi's mum and Babar's dad
and Simba's dad and Nigel.

712
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:42,640
- Our next-door neighbour.
- I don't think this is my pebble.

713
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:45,185
Oh, it definitely is.
I'd recognise it anywhere.

714
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:48,188
Let's go, little beavers!
More driftwood.

715
00:43:53,402 --> 00:43:57,614
- Can we bury you, Granddad?
- Oh, no, that sand gets everywhere.

716
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:00,116
I definitely don't want to be buried,
thank you.

717
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:02,368
- Not even when you die?
- Jess!

718
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:04,788
Well, that's what happens
when someone dies.

719
00:44:04,872 --> 00:44:07,707
You bury them
and then everyone eats cake.

720
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:11,127
- That's right, isn't it, Granddad?
- Absolutely, sweetheart.

721
00:44:11,212 --> 00:44:13,755
I've never seen
the point of funerals myself.

722
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,174
Nice people
all standing around in the kirk

723
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:19,761
while the priest tells a pack of lies
about what a great man you were.

724
00:44:19,845 --> 00:44:22,597
Nah, put me out with the recycling.

725
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:25,809
Purple bin, isn't it,
for plastics and dead granddads?

726
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:30,522
Oh, come on, it's only a joke.

727
00:44:30,606 --> 00:44:33,691
No, if I had to choose
a kind of funeral,

728
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:36,736
just give me a good old Viking funeral,
like my ancestors.

729
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,407
Just stick me on a burning boat
and float me out to sea.

730
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:45,995
No stupid family fights,
no stupid rows about who gets what

731
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,209
or who does what.
Just a warrior's farewell.

732
00:44:51,293 --> 00:44:54,337
Can we go out
and catch some fish to cook it?

733
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:57,257
Yeah, get some crabs while you're there.

734
00:44:58,008 --> 00:45:00,426
There are sandwiches in the pick-up,
aren't there?

735
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:03,638
Yeah, but you can't hunt sandwiches,
can you?

736
00:45:03,722 --> 00:45:05,974
The water won't be cold,
will it, Granddad?

737
00:45:06,058 --> 00:45:08,059
Course not, it's only
the North Atlantic.

738
00:45:08,143 --> 00:45:09,811
Why on Earth would it be cold?

739
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:15,984
It's freezing!

740
00:45:18,988 --> 00:45:20,864
You lied to us!

741
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:30,081
Look, you've got to pat it down
like this.

742
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:34,544
- I'm decorating it.
- That's after.

743
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:36,212
Are you OK back there?

744
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:40,091
Aye, I'm grand,
apart from the sand up my arse.

745
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:44,262
Oh, look. Look up there,
it's the osprey.

746
00:45:44,346 --> 00:45:47,015
Oh, look at that.

747
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:48,641
It's just a bird.

748
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:50,727
17 years
she's been coming back.

749
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:52,520
Flown all the way from Africa.

750
00:45:52,605 --> 00:45:58,151
You can't really lay a egg in Africa
cos you'll get a fried egg.

751
00:45:58,277 --> 00:46:01,529
- How far is Africa?
- About eight million miles away.

752
00:46:01,614 --> 00:46:04,324
That's rubbish, isn't it, Granddad?

753
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,829
Hey, Granddad.

754
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:12,373
Perhaps he's asleep.

755
00:46:16,128 --> 00:46:17,545
Granddad?

756
00:46:24,803 --> 00:46:26,387
Granddad?

757
00:46:26,472 --> 00:46:29,349
Granddad! That wasn't funny!

758
00:46:30,976 --> 00:46:33,186
- Well, it was quite funny.
- No, it wasn't.

759
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:35,605
It was funnier than monkeys!

760
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:42,362
Mum and Dad lie so much.

761
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:44,906
I just don't trust them any more.

762
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:48,701
They make me so angry.

763
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:51,579
Well, I used to feel like that
about my lot, too.

764
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:53,039
Until I suddenly realised

765
00:46:53,082 --> 00:46:55,708
there was no point in being angry
with people I loved

766
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:57,043
for being what they are.

767
00:46:57,127 --> 00:47:01,214
I mean, so what if your dad
is a complete and utter bloody shambles?

768
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:05,551
Or your Uncle Gavin's
a bit of a tight-arse?

769
00:47:05,636 --> 00:47:08,930
All that social climbing!
He can't help himself

770
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:14,227
any more than his wife can help
being scared of her own shadow

771
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:16,437
or your mum can help
being a bit mouthy.

772
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:20,441
The truth is,
every human being on this planet

773
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:23,236
is ridiculous in their own way.

774
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:26,572
So we shouldn't judge
and we shouldn't fight,

775
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:28,741
because in the end...

776
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:33,246
In the end,

777
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,417
none of it matters, none of this stuff.

778
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:41,963
Lottie, this shell's got legs!

779
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:44,757
It's OK, it'll be a hermit crab.

780
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:21,794
Frazer? What are you doing here?

781
00:48:24,173 --> 00:48:28,051
Oh... I get it.

782
00:48:28,177 --> 00:48:30,970
Are you coming in for a swim,
you big Mary?

783
00:48:57,498 --> 00:49:00,041
Hey, Granddad, can we cook this crab?

784
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:04,420
Or will it be unfair on the beach?
I can put it back if you want or...

785
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,843
Oh, Granddad. Stop mucking around.

786
00:49:10,886 --> 00:49:13,221
I'm not falling for that again.

787
00:49:27,194 --> 00:49:31,405
Lottie! There's something not right
with Granddad.

788
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:35,576
Oh, he's just doing
that stupid joke again.

789
00:49:35,702 --> 00:49:37,370
Come on, Granddad.

790
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:44,085
Granddad?

791
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:47,296
Granddad.

792
00:49:48,298 --> 00:49:50,049
Granddad?

793
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:53,261
I think he might be dead.

794
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:05,940
He's not breathing.

795
00:50:07,985 --> 00:50:10,278
I'm gonna check his pulse.

796
00:50:12,072 --> 00:50:13,906
They taught us this in Brownies.

797
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:34,260
Granddad's got no pulse

798
00:50:34,303 --> 00:50:38,764
and we better get back
to tell everyone he's died.

799
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:43,519
Such bad luck.
Dying just before your birthday party.

800
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:46,772
Come on. The grown-ups
will know what to do.

801
00:50:46,815 --> 00:50:48,858
- They'll just argue.
- Hey?

802
00:50:48,942 --> 00:50:52,028
They'll argue and fight,
like Granddad said.

803
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:55,698
And he said he didn't want that.

804
00:50:55,824 --> 00:51:01,495
If we leave him, he might get eaten
by badgers and seals and puffins.

805
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:05,333
You go back, Lottie.
We'll stay here and guard Granddad.

806
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:07,460
You're sure you'll be OK with that?

807
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:09,629
Well, that's very brave
and grown-up of you.

808
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:12,465
Do you think it'll be all right
if I can have the Swiss roll?

809
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:14,008
I think that'll be all right.

810
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:17,553
We won't eat Granddad's,
just in case.

811
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:20,723
I won't be long! Be sensible!

812
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:46,540
I read in a newspaper article that
said when people had stopped breathing,

813
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:49,502
when people's heart stopped,
they die

814
00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:54,048
and then when they die, they felt
themselves leave their bodies

815
00:51:54,174 --> 00:51:58,386
and they find themselves
hovering their own bodies

816
00:51:58,512 --> 00:52:01,264
and looking down on people.

817
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:19,907
You said it'd be
a small family gathering.

818
00:52:20,033 --> 00:52:22,702
- It's more like Glastonbury.
- Don't exaggerate.

819
00:52:22,744 --> 00:52:26,372
- Parading Dad. "Meet my dad..."
- Dad knows these people, OK?

820
00:52:26,415 --> 00:52:28,791
- You should give him what he wants.
- He's very ill.

821
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:31,877
He doesn't know what he wants.
We have to make decisions for him.

822
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:34,046
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

823
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:36,048
- Cos you're never here.
- Oh...

824
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:40,428
This is going to be a reasonable-sized
gathering to celebrate Dad's life.

825
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:43,806
Where have you booked for the funeral?
Westminster Abbey? The O2 Arena?

826
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:46,309
- Shh! Yeah, Leon, I'm just...
- Who's that?

827
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:49,228
Oh, Leon?
Geordie Leon? My kids' new dad?

828
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:52,231
- Oh! Hello, Leon!
- You pathetic child!

829
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:54,734
- Mum...
- Leon is my new boss.

830
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:56,736
The man I'm screwing is called Wallace.

831
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:01,282
Wallace? Do the kids know?

832
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:04,452
- I'll tell them when it's time.
- Does he have a dog called Gromit?

833
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:06,287
Here come the stupid jokes.

834
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:02,134
- She ate Granddad's Swiss roll.
- I didn't mean to!

835
00:54:02,177 --> 00:54:04,178
- It was a accident.
- It wasn't an accident.

836
00:54:04,304 --> 00:54:07,223
- It doesn't matter.
- Where are the grown-ups?

837
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:09,975
Fighting. Mickey was right.

838
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,645
They can't be trusted
to do what Granddad wanted.

839
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:14,563
So we're gonna do it.

840
00:54:14,648 --> 00:54:16,982
We're gonna give him
the funeral he wanted.

841
00:54:17,025 --> 00:54:18,901
- A Viking one?
- Yeah.

842
00:54:19,027 --> 00:54:21,529
- Cool.
- Where will we find a Viking boat?

843
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:24,865
There's one in York.

844
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:27,660
But I'm not sure
the museum will lend it to us

845
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:29,829
if we tell them we're gonna burn it.

846
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:32,665
Right, now listen,
we've all got to work together.

847
00:54:32,707 --> 00:54:35,584
- This is our present to Granddad.
- Shotgun the matches!

848
00:54:41,675 --> 00:54:42,716
Margaret!

849
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:53,519
That's drop-off point B. Turn around.

850
00:54:58,608 --> 00:55:01,569
So it won't be
a proper Viking longboat then?

851
00:55:01,695 --> 00:55:03,863
- No, it'll be a raft.
- How are we gonna move it?

852
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:05,906
We'll put it in Granddad's car.

853
00:55:06,032 --> 00:55:08,701
- But we can't drive.
- Yes, we can.

854
00:55:12,873 --> 00:55:16,125
Mickey, you push the pedal
and I'll do the wheel.

855
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:21,797
I think we need to do
something with this.

856
00:55:21,882 --> 00:55:24,133
Which one should I do?
One, two, three or R?

857
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:27,553
- One.
- I think we should go with R

858
00:55:27,596 --> 00:55:30,890
because we want the car
to go...

859
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:35,519
I'm gonna do one. Do you think
we'll get into trouble for this?

860
00:55:35,604 --> 00:55:37,730
The grown-ups
might be annoyed at first,

861
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:40,232
but once we tell them
this is what Granddad wanted...

862
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:42,902
Do the pedal again!

863
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:50,451
The car sounds a bit annoyed!

864
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:53,454
- How's that?
- Do I do left or right?

865
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,998
Right. No!

866
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,294
I'm not wearing a seat belt!

867
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:04,632
A bit more. Turn a bit harder.

868
00:56:05,842 --> 00:56:08,010
Is that better?

869
00:56:12,682 --> 00:56:15,100
How are we going to get that
in the back?

870
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,188
I've used every knot I know back there.

871
00:56:19,272 --> 00:56:21,315
Granddad said the tide's coming in,

872
00:56:21,441 --> 00:56:23,484
so if we leave the car
at the edge of the sea...

873
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:26,028
Whoa! This is bumpy!

874
00:56:27,155 --> 00:56:29,782
Jess, shout when it's at the edge.

875
00:56:31,493 --> 00:56:33,118
Edge!

876
00:56:36,665 --> 00:56:38,374
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Yay! We did it!

877
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:43,420
- Do you think we should lock it?
- Yes, we don't want it getting stolen.

878
00:56:45,465 --> 00:56:47,633
To be a proper Viking funeral,

879
00:56:47,676 --> 00:56:51,512
it's crucial that you need to take
his favourite things to heaven.

880
00:56:51,638 --> 00:56:52,888
I thought of that.

881
00:56:56,518 --> 00:56:59,144
Oh, his Scotland shirt. Brilliant!

882
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:06,235
- Granddad! He's alive!
- Granddad!

883
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,571
Wake up! Come on, Granddad!

884
00:57:08,697 --> 00:57:10,990
Wake up, Granddad!

885
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:13,242
Granddad.

886
00:57:14,661 --> 00:57:15,911
Come on.

887
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:22,209
He's cold.

888
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,173
I think people do farts
after they're dead.

889
00:57:28,717 --> 00:57:34,346
I saw it on this programme
called The Real Silent Witness.

890
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:38,851
- This woman said so.
- Are you sure?

891
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:44,356
She was wearing a white coat.
She said dead people are full of gas.

892
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,403
I'm scared.

893
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:54,241
It's OK. It's only Granddad.

894
00:57:56,953 --> 00:58:01,206
He sort of died in battle
cos he was fighting cancer,

895
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:03,292
so we'll give him a warrior's funeral.

896
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,915
I didn't think this would work.

897
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:46,752
Well, it works at Stonehenge.
Druids moved huge rocks.

898
00:58:46,795 --> 00:58:50,923
Not granddads. So well done, my brain.

899
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:54,093
I so can't wait to go back to school

900
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:58,097
when we get to write about
what I did on our half term.

901
00:58:58,181 --> 00:59:01,517
But I bet Shona's done
something more interesting

902
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:02,810
like she always has.

903
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,627
Goodbye.

904
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:30,963
You were nice.

905
00:59:34,843 --> 00:59:37,052
Please accept my pebble.

906
00:59:56,698 --> 01:00:00,826
We are gathered here,
to remember Gordie McLeod.

907
01:00:01,995 --> 01:00:03,746
I'm sorry you died, Granddad.

908
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:09,084
I liked having someone to talk to.

909
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:15,340
Have a good Valhalla.

910
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:17,092
Amen.

911
01:00:51,211 --> 01:00:53,629
He'd be so proud of us.

912
01:01:25,537 --> 01:01:27,913
We can do folk rock,
we can do country,

913
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:30,833
we can do country folk rock,
indie folk rock.

914
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:35,337
Oh, my goodness. Where have you been?

915
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:37,130
- We need...
- I told Granddad seven.

916
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:39,007
- But...
- Oh, you're all mucky.

917
01:01:39,092 --> 01:01:41,218
- Come on, bath time.
- But we need...

918
01:01:41,302 --> 01:01:43,512
Did I mention bluegrass?
We can do bluegrass.

919
01:01:43,596 --> 01:01:45,639
But not so fast
since Billy had his stroke.

920
01:01:45,723 --> 01:01:47,599
Chop chop, the party's starting soon.

921
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:50,894
- I've laid your clothes out.
- Granddad died.

922
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:53,772
- What?
- Granddad died.

923
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:55,941
Oh, crikey, guys,
what time do you call this?

924
01:01:56,025 --> 01:01:58,986
Doug. They're saying Gordie's died.

925
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:03,407
Hallelujah. At last. So what have
you done with your granddad, eh?

926
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:08,328
- Well...
- He died. On the beach.

927
01:02:08,413 --> 01:02:10,289
OK, I'm on it.

928
01:02:10,373 --> 01:02:12,749
- I shouldn't have let him...
- It's all right, love.

929
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:14,877
Yes, ambulance, quickly,
please to, erm...

930
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:17,546
- Lottie, where exactly is Granddad now?
- Out at sea.

931
01:02:20,049 --> 01:02:22,759
- Out at sea?
- And on fire.

932
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:29,850
He wanted a Viking funeral,
so we built a raft, put the body on it,

933
01:02:29,934 --> 01:02:32,644
set it on fire
and floated him out to sea.

934
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:35,647
Can you hold on a sec?

935
01:02:35,732 --> 01:02:39,318
Lottie. Stop being silly,
just tell us, where is Granddad?

936
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:42,154
Ah, yeah. This is a wind-up.

937
01:02:42,238 --> 01:02:43,822
He's put you up to this, hasn't he?

938
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:46,241
This is one of Granddad's
stupid jokes, isn't it?

939
01:02:46,326 --> 01:02:48,410
Well, he did do it as a joke
to pretend to die,

940
01:02:48,494 --> 01:02:51,163
but this time, it's not a joke.

941
01:02:51,998 --> 01:02:55,083
- Hello?
- Yes, er, yeah.

942
01:02:55,168 --> 01:02:59,212
We're just getting the details if you
could just show us a bit of patience.

943
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:02,007
I know that you're going to tell me
exactly what happened.

944
01:03:02,091 --> 01:03:04,760
Well, I found lots of wood and...

945
01:03:04,844 --> 01:03:07,262
- Er...
...and I found lots of crabs.

946
01:03:07,347 --> 01:03:08,931
- Right...
- I lost my rock.

947
01:03:09,015 --> 01:03:12,517
- At the end of the day, I found it.
- But what happened to Granddad?

948
01:03:12,602 --> 01:03:17,356
There was a lady with a girlfriend
that lived with lots of pigs.

949
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,232
- After the lady.
- She sweared a lot.

950
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:21,902
- Back to Granddad.
- It's vital you tell the truth.

951
01:03:21,986 --> 01:03:23,946
- We do tell the truth.
- Keep it down.

952
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:27,115
Nothing to do with the fish
or the crab or your stone, sweetie.

953
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,200
Where is Granddad?

954
01:03:28,284 --> 01:03:30,369
If you listen, I'll tell you the story.

955
01:03:30,453 --> 01:03:33,246
- I know, darling, but faster.
- So will you listen?

956
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:34,373
Hm-hmm.

957
01:03:34,457 --> 01:03:36,541
- Grandpa farted.
- Oh.

958
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:40,545
Yes, we do still need an ambulance.
And the police.

959
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:43,507
And possibly the coastguard.

960
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:47,094
No, we don't need the fire brigade,
and I don't appreciate your tone.

961
01:03:47,178 --> 01:03:49,429
Well, he is on fire.

962
01:03:49,514 --> 01:03:52,099
- Quickly now.
- I found some fishes.

963
01:03:52,183 --> 01:03:55,560
- Yep, after...
- Lottie knocked over some signs.

964
01:03:55,645 --> 01:03:56,770
What happened next?

965
01:03:56,854 --> 01:04:00,482
Yes, it is an emergency, we just
don't know what sort of emergency.

966
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:01,775
And then?

967
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:04,945
I stopped the crows
from eating Grandpa.

968
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:06,029
OK.

969
01:04:06,155 --> 01:04:08,907
I'm perfectly aware
that it is a criminal offence

970
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:10,534
to make prank calls, but...

971
01:04:11,786 --> 01:04:14,329
She's hung up! 999 has hung up!

972
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:16,581
Do we still have to have a bath?

973
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:19,626
- Erm... Er, no.
- Yay!

974
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,463
Car keys! Where the bloody hell
are the car keys?

975
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:25,590
We'll take ours.

976
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:28,301
Okey-dokey.

977
01:04:28,386 --> 01:04:31,513
Now then, I have some very important
cake-tasting needs done.

978
01:04:31,597 --> 01:04:34,307
Do I have any volunteers
to help me with that?

979
01:05:26,235 --> 01:05:27,861
You stupid...!

980
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:36,912
- You stupid...
- Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.

981
01:05:36,996 --> 01:05:40,040
Come on. No, no! Whoa, whoa! All right!

982
01:05:40,124 --> 01:05:42,709
All right, all right, it's all right.

983
01:05:42,794 --> 01:05:45,504
It's OK. It's all right.

984
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:03,396
Two, three, four.

985
01:06:15,451 --> 01:06:19,162
I don't believe this.
This is a bloody nightmare.

986
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:21,748
Sir Donald, glad you could make it.

987
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:23,333
A bloody total nightmare.

988
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:26,878
Hughie. Good to see you.

989
01:06:26,963 --> 01:06:29,214
A bloody total nightmare.

990
01:06:29,298 --> 01:06:32,217
- Gavin, language. The children.
- Right, yeah.

991
01:06:32,301 --> 01:06:35,220
They can't hear "bloody"
but they can set fire to my father.

992
01:06:35,304 --> 01:06:37,597
We didn't hurt him. He was dead.

993
01:06:37,682 --> 01:06:40,475
- Let's hope so.
- For Christ's sake. They were...

994
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,645
Someone best break it
to the ones who've arrived.

995
01:06:43,729 --> 01:06:46,857
- We just did what Granddad wanted.
- He didn't want this.

996
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:50,152
He wanted to be cremated. Don't say it.
I'm looking for someone to punch

997
01:06:50,236 --> 01:06:53,655
- and your children are too small!
- Enough!

998
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:01,246
Odin.

999
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:07,627
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1000
01:07:12,717 --> 01:07:13,925
Sorry, no photos.

1001
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,344
Thank you all so much for coming.

1002
01:07:16,429 --> 01:07:20,140
Gordie would be pleased to see so many
of his friends gathered together.

1003
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:24,603
Except sadly,

1004
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:27,480
Gordie can't be pleased because...

1005
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:32,903
he passed away today.

1006
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:36,698
We think.

1007
01:07:36,782 --> 01:07:41,286
W-W-We're fairly certain he has.

1008
01:07:44,624 --> 01:07:47,876
Anyway,
I know you won't feel like dancing,

1009
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:52,297
but do please have a drink
and make yourselves at home.

1010
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:55,175
Jimmy Cazerotto?

1011
01:07:55,259 --> 01:07:56,301
Margaret!

1012
01:07:56,385 --> 01:08:01,139
- We thought you were in New Zealand.
- Where is the old bastard? Huh?

1013
01:08:03,226 --> 01:08:06,436
- Jimmy, I'm Abi.
- What?

1014
01:08:34,257 --> 01:08:37,008
Where's Kenneth?
He's supposed to be...

1015
01:08:37,093 --> 01:08:41,513
- Aha! You took your time, Murdo.
- It's Andy Mackay's stag night.

1016
01:08:41,597 --> 01:08:43,682
A dwarf got thrown through a window.

1017
01:08:45,226 --> 01:08:48,311
- This is Agnes Chisholm.
- From the Child Welfare Unit.

1018
01:08:48,437 --> 01:08:50,814
I'll require a room for interviews.

1019
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,858
I found this child outside.
Unaccompanied.

1020
01:08:53,943 --> 01:08:56,361
Yeah, that's my son.

1021
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:00,073
Thank you.

1022
01:09:00,157 --> 01:09:03,076
Why have they called the police?
We've done nothing wrong.

1023
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,120
Please do exactly as I ask.

1024
01:09:05,204 --> 01:09:07,956
There is a procedure
for this kind of situation.

1025
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,543
- There is?
- Oh, yes.

1026
01:09:11,627 --> 01:09:13,378
So he's at peace.

1027
01:09:13,462 --> 01:09:14,963
At... At peace.

1028
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:18,466
Can I see him one last time?

1029
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:22,178
I've come all the way
from New Zealand, you know.

1030
01:09:23,973 --> 01:09:26,933
I'm afraid that's not possible, Jimmy.

1031
01:09:27,018 --> 01:09:30,770
It's not... not... possible.

1032
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:40,405
Sir Donald.
Very sorry about this, Sir Donald.

1033
01:09:41,615 --> 01:09:43,033
It's funny, this morning...

1034
01:09:43,117 --> 01:09:49,456
And we think...
we think that's what happened

1035
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,791
but obviously, that's...

1036
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:53,376
That's what?

1037
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:58,173
Confidential.

1038
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:03,428
That the kids burnt his body
and floated him out to sea?

1039
01:10:13,022 --> 01:10:16,024
Er, yes, well, the kids, erm...

1040
01:10:17,651 --> 01:10:18,902
They're from London.

1041
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:22,822
So, thank you for that, Jess.

1042
01:10:22,907 --> 01:10:24,240
And if it's OK with you,

1043
01:10:24,325 --> 01:10:28,244
I'll just keep this lovely drawing
I asked you to do of the three of you

1044
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:31,498
setting fire to your grandpa.

1045
01:10:31,582 --> 01:10:35,251
- Do you want to put it on your fridge?
- No. That's not...

1046
01:10:35,336 --> 01:10:39,381
There wasn't exactly
a unicorn on the beach

1047
01:10:39,465 --> 01:10:41,091
but I just got bored.

1048
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:43,343
Perhaps we could hang on to the picture.

1049
01:10:43,427 --> 01:10:46,554
It will be returned to you
when the investigation's completed.

1050
01:10:46,639 --> 01:10:47,639
Can I go now?

1051
01:10:47,723 --> 01:10:51,267
- I was halfway through a Cheese String.
- OK.

1052
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,069
So she holds her breath
quite often, does she?

1053
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:25,093
So, Mickey, the idea
for the special funeral,

1054
01:11:25,177 --> 01:11:27,387
- who did that come from?
- Odin.

1055
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:31,099
Odin?

1056
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:35,019
He walks the Earth with one eye
and a big hat and an eight-legged horse

1057
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:37,856
disguised as a traveller
to see if people's nice to him

1058
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,566
and he's here now.

1059
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:44,863
So, Odin, the Norse god,
is currently here

1060
01:11:44,947 --> 01:11:48,032
with an eight-legged horse?

1061
01:11:57,376 --> 01:12:00,503
Ach, sod it, lads. Let's call it a day.

1062
01:12:10,764 --> 01:12:12,432
Kenneth! Kenneth!

1063
01:12:12,516 --> 01:12:14,392
Where the hell is he?

1064
01:12:18,314 --> 01:12:21,274
Is this an effective use
of police resources?

1065
01:12:21,358 --> 01:12:24,319
Shouldn't you be out
looking for evidence of my father?

1066
01:12:24,403 --> 01:12:26,112
We haven't got a submarine.

1067
01:12:26,197 --> 01:12:29,866
Oh. Jokes is it now?

1068
01:12:30,576 --> 01:12:33,036
Make it bigger! Bigger!

1069
01:12:33,162 --> 01:12:35,163
Don't stress, I'm trying.

1070
01:12:35,247 --> 01:12:36,748
This isn't cats.

1071
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:38,833
It's something
Kenneth's been watching.

1072
01:12:38,918 --> 01:12:42,545
Don't just press buttons at random.

1073
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:52,305
Is that the YouTube thing?

1074
01:12:53,432 --> 01:12:56,684
I've thought of a joke.
A very funny joke. Yeah.

1075
01:12:58,854 --> 01:13:00,939
I make an official complaint

1076
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:04,609
to your Chief Superintendent
who happens to be a friend of mine

1077
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:10,698
who happens to be in my house right now
as a guest, so...

1078
01:13:14,578 --> 01:13:18,456
So, Lottie,
when your granddad passed away...

1079
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:23,253
Ten to four. Approximately.

1080
01:13:24,755 --> 01:13:26,422
That's a pretty wee notebook.

1081
01:13:27,299 --> 01:13:30,218
What sort of things do you put in that?

1082
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:33,221
Thoughts, facts, information.

1083
01:13:34,348 --> 01:13:35,431
Lies that I get told.

1084
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:37,809
Could I possibly have a look at that?

1085
01:13:43,566 --> 01:13:45,900
Do you think
I could hang on to this for a bit?

1086
01:13:45,985 --> 01:13:49,195
Is that really necessary?
Why would...

1087
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,905
Why would you need to hang on to it?

1088
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:54,033
You're not thinking of...
removing us anywhere, are you?

1089
01:13:54,118 --> 01:13:57,912
Don't be silly, darling. This lady's
not here to do that. Are you?

1090
01:13:57,997 --> 01:14:00,415
At this stage,
I'm just making an assessment.

1091
01:14:07,339 --> 01:14:09,340
What is that?

1092
01:14:09,425 --> 01:14:11,759
God, what is she doing?

1093
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,435
I take it you hadn't seen this,
Mr McLeod.

1094
01:14:20,519 --> 01:14:22,020
No charges were brought.

1095
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:25,940
No, the staff at the mini mart
were very good about it.

1096
01:14:26,025 --> 01:14:29,777
Everyone... you know,
understood that your wife was,

1097
01:14:29,862 --> 01:14:34,616
you know, adversely affected
by her medication.

1098
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:39,162
- Medication?
- Yeah, the anti-depressants.

1099
01:14:39,913 --> 01:14:41,873
For the depression.

1100
01:14:45,544 --> 01:14:47,420
It's not your night, is it?

1101
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,342
Who fancies a dram?

1102
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:55,011
I'm taking orders.

1103
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:58,806
I've got Glengoyne or Glenmorangie.

1104
01:15:02,144 --> 01:15:03,519
It's finished. Play it again.

1105
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:06,230
Oh, for Christ's sake! Kids!

1106
01:15:13,947 --> 01:15:15,114
Everything all right?

1107
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:19,118
Please don't go anywhere
without notifying me, will you?

1108
01:15:30,881 --> 01:15:32,590
Has something happened?

1109
01:15:56,448 --> 01:15:59,534
Why is the knives and forks so loud?

1110
01:15:59,618 --> 01:16:01,035
Oh!

1111
01:16:02,621 --> 01:16:06,374
- Have you ever read Lottie's notebook?
- No. Have you?

1112
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:08,292
No.

1113
01:16:08,377 --> 01:16:10,670
Well, not... not much.

1114
01:16:10,754 --> 01:16:12,588
She writes down everything.

1115
01:16:12,673 --> 01:16:14,549
Hey, sleep OK, sweetheart?

1116
01:16:17,428 --> 01:16:20,847
And now intervention woman's got it.

1117
01:16:20,931 --> 01:16:23,307
- Intervention?
- That's the word she keeps using.

1118
01:16:26,603 --> 01:16:28,730
I think maybe we should get a lawyer.

1119
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:31,941
Another lawyer? They've been great
at calming things down.

1120
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:34,777
The important thing is
not to antagonise her.

1121
01:16:34,862 --> 01:16:36,487
- We just need to...
- Good morning.

1122
01:16:36,572 --> 01:16:38,364
Morning.

1123
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:40,700
Jesus, no, no!

1124
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:44,078
For God's sake, Kenneth!

1125
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:49,375
How did they find us so fast?

1126
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,128
That'll be that bloody Donny Mackay.

1127
01:16:53,797 --> 01:16:56,340
He'll do anything
to fill his bloody guest house.

1128
01:16:58,218 --> 01:16:59,844
Oh, what's the point?

1129
01:16:59,928 --> 01:17:02,346
No one gets to keep
any secrets any more.

1130
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:04,098
Well, you can say that again.

1131
01:17:04,183 --> 01:17:07,643
No one gets to keep
any secrets any more.

1132
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:11,105
Bloody vultures!

1133
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:14,066
Why can't Scotland have
a law of trespass like a real country?

1134
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:17,153
Oh, Lord.
It's Little Miss Sunshine.

1135
01:17:18,197 --> 01:17:20,448
- Oh, Christ. Just be...
- Be what?

1136
01:17:20,532 --> 01:17:22,658
Just be... You know...

1137
01:17:27,664 --> 01:17:30,458
I came through the back lane
to evade all the media.

1138
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:32,794
Well, thank you.

1139
01:17:34,505 --> 01:17:35,505
May I come in?

1140
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:36,756
- Of course.
- Why?

1141
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,674
- I'm sorry?
- Why do you want to come in?

1142
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:41,344
- Abi, she's just...
- I need more information.

1143
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:42,637
What sort of information?

1144
01:17:42,721 --> 01:17:46,432
Information to help assess
which of the range of outcomes...

1145
01:17:46,517 --> 01:17:50,269
- Outcomes? What outcomes?
- Outcomes, Abi.

1146
01:17:50,354 --> 01:17:52,438
A range of outcomes
from intervention to...

1147
01:17:52,523 --> 01:17:54,524
There! She said it.

1148
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:57,026
I could involve the police
in this conversation.

1149
01:17:57,152 --> 01:17:58,945
You can come in when I get an assurance

1150
01:17:59,029 --> 01:18:01,656
that there is no possibility
of you taking away my kids.

1151
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:04,575
- Abi.
- As I was in the process of saying...

1152
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:07,161
- I'll take that as a no, then.
- Abi!

1153
01:18:07,246 --> 01:18:09,664
Jesus. Look at this.

1154
01:18:10,582 --> 01:18:12,291
Look at it. Look.

1155
01:18:12,376 --> 01:18:14,919
We're front page of
the Daily Mail as well.

1156
01:18:15,003 --> 01:18:16,963
- Thank you, Kenneth.
- And the Express.

1157
01:18:17,047 --> 01:18:19,882
- Kenneth, that's enough.
- "Feral Children Sacrifice..."

1158
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:23,177
Kenneth! We can do without
the bloody rolling bulletin!

1159
01:18:23,262 --> 01:18:25,263
- Thank you.
- We need to deal with this.

1160
01:18:25,347 --> 01:18:28,182
- It's not helpful.
- I'm trying to be informative.

1161
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:30,685
Kenneth!

1162
01:18:37,067 --> 01:18:40,444
Look, Gavin,
about the supermarket episode...

1163
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:43,281
There's nothing... helpful
to be said about that.

1164
01:18:48,453 --> 01:18:50,872
- Ah, I was wondering...
- I'd like my notebook back.

1165
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:55,376
I'm sorry, Lottie, I'm only permitted to
talk to you in an interview situation.

1166
01:18:56,545 --> 01:19:00,590
Actually, could I just nip in
and use your phone for a moment?

1167
01:19:07,931 --> 01:19:09,724
But the Prime Minister
has tweeted

1168
01:19:09,808 --> 01:19:12,852
that the incident is the symptom
of a broken society.

1169
01:19:16,231 --> 01:19:19,275
Don't worry, Dad, I told you,
Odin will sort all this out.

1170
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:20,943
Mickey, you didn't see Odin.

1171
01:19:21,028 --> 01:19:23,029
Miss Pringle said that she saw Jesus

1172
01:19:23,113 --> 01:19:25,448
and if she can see Jesus,
I can see Odin.

1173
01:19:25,532 --> 01:19:27,575
You didn't see Odin!
There is no Odin.

1174
01:19:27,659 --> 01:19:29,368
This is the real world.

1175
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:33,581
We're on television!

1176
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,585
The three children
from this family

1177
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:39,754
who cannot be named
for legal reasons...

1178
01:19:39,838 --> 01:19:42,632
- Oh!
...are inside the house.

1179
01:19:42,758 --> 01:19:45,551
- The police have announced...
- We can only confirm

1180
01:19:45,636 --> 01:19:48,346
that the body of a man
in his mid-seventies

1181
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:53,809
was... destroyed and floated out to sea

1182
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,478
possibly with some valuables.

1183
01:19:57,606 --> 01:19:58,689
Hi, there.

1184
01:19:58,774 --> 01:20:01,484
I forgot to put
the brooch in my drawing.

1185
01:20:01,568 --> 01:20:03,110
- Yes, it was.
- Brooch?

1186
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:06,072
Granddad's Viking brooch.
We put it on the raft.

1187
01:20:06,156 --> 01:20:09,033
All Vikings went to Valhalla
with their treasure.

1188
01:20:09,785 --> 01:20:11,661
You morons!

1189
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:13,704
Well, that's just rude.

1190
01:20:13,789 --> 01:20:15,373
You, stupid, stupid little...

1191
01:20:15,457 --> 01:20:18,542
- Whoa, whoa, enough!
- They've destroyed a family heirloom.

1192
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:21,170
- Dad found it.
- It's worth £15,000.

1193
01:20:21,296 --> 01:20:24,131
- 15,000?
- I had it valued.

1194
01:20:24,216 --> 01:20:27,593
- Oh, I get it.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1195
01:20:27,678 --> 01:20:29,136
- Thinking ahead?
- Doug...

1196
01:20:29,221 --> 01:20:32,848
Thought we'd keep that secret
till after we divided up Dad's things?

1197
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:36,477
I was going to announce it
as a surprise for his birthday.

1198
01:20:36,561 --> 01:20:39,563
Please! I'm glad
he's not here to listen to this.

1199
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:42,400
He probably would be here
if it wasn't for your mental kids!

1200
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:44,485
- It is not the kids' fault!
- That's right!

1201
01:20:44,569 --> 01:20:45,945
- It's his.
- What?

1202
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:47,613
Lottie tried to get us to listen

1203
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:50,700
and you were too busy having
an argument with your stupid brother.

1204
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:54,036
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- Oh, just go chuck a pumpkin!

1205
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:56,622
- That's enough.
- It's not enough.

1206
01:20:56,707 --> 01:20:59,375
- Nothing's enough for you, is it?
- Stop!

1207
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:03,963
Stop it now! This is exactly
what Granddad said would happen.

1208
01:21:05,007 --> 01:21:09,010
He wanted a Viking funeral so it would
give you all less to fight about.

1209
01:21:09,094 --> 01:21:12,555
He said no one should fight,
because at the end of the day,

1210
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,725
it doesn't matter
if Uncle Gavin's a tight-arse

1211
01:21:15,851 --> 01:21:20,771
and Dad's a shambles
and Mum's a bit mouthy

1212
01:21:20,856 --> 01:21:26,569
and Auntie Margaret's...
something or other.

1213
01:21:26,653 --> 01:21:29,363
He said you mustn't mind about that
in the people you love.

1214
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:35,453
Because... we're all... ridiculous,
and none of this matters.

1215
01:21:36,413 --> 01:21:40,416
Erm, well, I'm sorry, Gavin.
I shouldn't have said all that stuff.

1216
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:45,880
No, no, it was me.
I didn't... I was being a...

1217
01:21:45,964 --> 01:21:48,215
Listen, kids. I'm really sorry, but...

1218
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:52,720
Sometimes when adults
get a little bit upset,

1219
01:21:52,804 --> 01:21:53,888
they just become a...

1220
01:21:53,972 --> 01:21:56,182
Where's Mickey?

1221
01:21:56,266 --> 01:21:58,184
He's on there.

1222
01:21:58,268 --> 01:22:01,520
I'm fed up of being stuck inside.
I've come out to explain.

1223
01:22:01,605 --> 01:22:04,565
- Jesus!
- Tell them "no comment"!

1224
01:22:04,649 --> 01:22:06,233
Cos this is the real world.

1225
01:22:06,318 --> 01:22:09,361
Granddad stopped breathing
and then what happened...

1226
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:11,655
That's enough, thank you.

1227
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,825
- You best go back inside.
- I was trying to explain everything.

1228
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:17,953
- Yeah, I know but...
- As it's all our fault,

1229
01:22:18,038 --> 01:22:20,748
I thought it might stop the shouting.

1230
01:22:22,292 --> 01:22:24,668
No, it's not all your fault.
Nothing's your fault.

1231
01:22:27,964 --> 01:22:29,757
You head inside, go on.

1232
01:22:32,344 --> 01:22:34,929
- We have no comment to make.
- Good. Straight bat.

1233
01:22:35,013 --> 01:22:36,430
You were on TV!

1234
01:22:36,515 --> 01:22:38,557
We have no comment to make
at this juncture.

1235
01:22:38,642 --> 01:22:41,769
Mr McLeod,
can you confirm reports?

1236
01:22:41,853 --> 01:22:45,564
Except to say... you should
all be ashamed of yourselves.

1237
01:22:45,649 --> 01:22:47,650
- What's he doing?
- You're a disgrace!

1238
01:22:47,734 --> 01:22:48,818
Don't provoke them!

1239
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:51,779
You have guidelines.
My son is six years old!

1240
01:22:51,863 --> 01:22:54,365
Then why's he wandering about alone?

1241
01:22:54,449 --> 01:22:57,159
He was... We have no further comment.

1242
01:22:57,244 --> 01:23:00,579
Why were young children left
in the care of an elderly, sick man?

1243
01:23:00,664 --> 01:23:02,790
- Mr McLeod, over here!
- Well...

1244
01:23:02,874 --> 01:23:06,210
We... we did deliberate over that.

1245
01:23:06,294 --> 01:23:07,336
Walk away, man.

1246
01:23:09,464 --> 01:23:11,632
Is your divorce
affecting your children?

1247
01:23:13,552 --> 01:23:16,011
Your divorce, caused by your affair.

1248
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:19,473
Do you take responsibility

1249
01:23:19,558 --> 01:23:23,102
for the actions of your children?
Do you feel you've failed as a father?

1250
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:27,565
Sorry, what?

1251
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:29,984
Do you feel you've failed as a father?

1252
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:32,403
Well, I'm not sure that...

1253
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,823
I mean...

1254
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:39,285
- It's true that I've certainly...
- Mrs McLeod.

1255
01:23:39,369 --> 01:23:42,037
My husband is a good and loving father.

1256
01:23:42,122 --> 01:23:44,039
We have no further comment.

1257
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:46,625
Would you describe your marriage
as dysfunctional?

1258
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:50,796
Oh, the magic word, "dysfunctional".
Yeah! Yep, fine.

1259
01:23:50,881 --> 01:23:53,257
- Fine, we're dysfunctional.
- She's doing it now.

1260
01:23:53,341 --> 01:23:55,050
If you mean by "dysfunctional"

1261
01:23:55,135 --> 01:23:58,345
that we're two average people
who have made a few mistakes,

1262
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,723
and are trying very hard
to muddle through

1263
01:24:00,807 --> 01:24:02,308
while trying our utmost

1264
01:24:02,392 --> 01:24:07,313
to protect and nurture
our three... fantastic children,

1265
01:24:07,397 --> 01:24:09,148
Jess, Mickey and Lottie...

1266
01:24:09,232 --> 01:24:11,650
- Yes! Name check.
- Yay!

1267
01:24:11,735 --> 01:24:14,695
Yes, we are dysfunctional.
Thank you.

1268
01:24:18,366 --> 01:24:20,117
Bravo, Abi.

1269
01:24:20,202 --> 01:24:24,330
Well done, Abi.
You certainly put them in their place.

1270
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,302
Has something else happened?

1271
01:24:50,857 --> 01:24:55,027
I've learnt my lesson. Next time I'm
with someone who's died on the beach,

1272
01:24:55,111 --> 01:24:58,572
I'll tell an adult
and I won't set fire to them.

1273
01:24:59,324 --> 01:25:00,699
Very sensible.

1274
01:25:00,784 --> 01:25:02,493
Cheers.

1275
01:25:04,579 --> 01:25:07,957
- It's nice that Mickey wants to be...
- I said no to the Newcastle job.

1276
01:25:09,834 --> 01:25:12,753
- Did you?
- Yeah.

1277
01:25:14,172 --> 01:25:15,172
Thanks.

1278
01:25:18,969 --> 01:25:21,303
I've decided I don't need a solicitor.

1279
01:25:21,388 --> 01:25:23,931
I know. My solicitor told me.

1280
01:25:24,015 --> 01:25:25,891
- Already?
- Yep.

1281
01:25:25,976 --> 01:25:28,227
She said it gave me a huge advantage.

1282
01:25:28,311 --> 01:25:31,188
She used the phrase "easy meat".

1283
01:25:32,357 --> 01:25:33,691
I'm gonna get rid of her.

1284
01:25:36,027 --> 01:25:38,487
Let's do this humanely.

1285
01:25:39,447 --> 01:25:41,115
Hmm.

1286
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,742
OK, everybody.

1287
01:25:43,827 --> 01:25:46,287
Everyone, if you could
just gather round.

1288
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:49,748
Sorry the midges are out
in their hordes.

1289
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:52,084
- This is...
- Over here, guys.

1290
01:25:52,168 --> 01:25:56,130
Lottie? I'm not sure
there's any actual, real evidence

1291
01:25:56,214 --> 01:25:58,841
that the Vikings actually
buried their dead

1292
01:25:58,925 --> 01:26:03,220
by burning them
and floating them out to sea.

1293
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:06,181
Mickey?

1294
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:09,977
Never, ever say that out loud again.

1295
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,814
Over here. Thanks.

1296
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:17,526
My brother Doug
is going to say a few words.

1297
01:26:29,789 --> 01:26:31,040
Thanks for coming.

1298
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:34,084
Well done
for shaking off the reporters.

1299
01:26:36,212 --> 01:26:39,923
The press have portrayed
my father's death as a disgrace.

1300
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:44,094
But what better way to die
could he have had...

1301
01:26:47,766 --> 01:26:49,516
than on his favourite beach...

1302
01:26:54,939 --> 01:26:57,608
watching the grandchildren
that he loved play...

1303
01:27:00,362 --> 01:27:01,987
play...

1304
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:08,911
I don't know what Dad
would have made of all this.

1305
01:27:10,872 --> 01:27:15,376
Actually, I do.
He'd have laughed himself stupid.

1306
01:27:17,003 --> 01:27:20,714
He'd have laughed at everyone turning up
for his party except for him.

1307
01:27:20,799 --> 01:27:22,633
He'd have laughed at the authorities

1308
01:27:22,717 --> 01:27:25,260
trying to find
the relevant form to fill in...

1309
01:27:26,763 --> 01:27:31,517
He'd certainly have laughed at
Margaret's starring role on YouTube.

1310
01:27:31,601 --> 01:27:36,313
4,458,207 hits at last count.

1311
01:27:37,982 --> 01:27:40,317
Three of them mine.

1312
01:27:42,737 --> 01:27:46,323
And me, he'd have laughed at me.
A lot.

1313
01:27:46,408 --> 01:27:48,283
And my main regret,

1314
01:27:48,368 --> 01:27:50,536
apart from not having
a bit more time with Dad,

1315
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:55,165
is that he couldn't see us all
running around like idiots.

1316
01:27:57,043 --> 01:27:59,920
I'm sure many of you believe
that he can see us,

1317
01:28:00,004 --> 01:28:03,382
but for my part, I think death is it.

1318
01:28:03,466 --> 01:28:06,802
I, er, I think life...

1319
01:28:08,096 --> 01:28:12,391
This life is all you get,
and Gordie McLeod had a hell of a life,

1320
01:28:12,475 --> 01:28:16,979
and so should we
cos that's all death is good for.

1321
01:28:17,063 --> 01:28:19,314
It's to give us a kick up the arse

1322
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:21,817
and say, "Get on with it,
and love those around you."

1323
01:28:23,528 --> 01:28:29,825
And... and now my wonderful son,
Kenneth, is gonna play something.

1324
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:38,041
No, no. Play something he'd like.

1325
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:41,503
Go mental.

1326
01:29:41,523 --> 01:29:43,690
He lives in that
and then he walks around in it.

1327
01:29:43,775 --> 01:29:46,151
That keeps his back end all safe.

1328
01:29:46,236 --> 01:29:49,071
- So he doesn't show his bottom?
- Exactly.

1329
01:29:49,155 --> 01:29:50,572
He keeps it in a shell.

1330
01:29:50,657 --> 01:29:52,950
Can we do that
with a large shell?

1331
01:29:53,034 --> 01:29:55,827
Listen, kids, we, erm...

1332
01:29:55,912 --> 01:30:00,415
Dad and me, we just wanted to...
to say something.

1333
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,960
We know that
we've not behaved very well recently

1334
01:30:03,044 --> 01:30:08,131
and, er... well, we just
wanted to say sorry.

1335
01:30:08,216 --> 01:30:09,299
That's right.

1336
01:30:09,384 --> 01:30:13,345
And, erm,
while we'll still be living apart,

1337
01:30:13,429 --> 01:30:16,723
in different... different houses,

1338
01:30:16,808 --> 01:30:22,104
we, er... from now on,
we're going to behave like grown-ups.

1339
01:30:28,444 --> 01:30:29,778
Inappropriate behaviour!

1340
01:30:29,904 --> 01:30:33,240
- Lottie, write that down in your book.
- I've chucked the book away.

1341
01:30:35,785 --> 01:30:37,828
I don't think I'll need it any more.

1342
01:30:52,093 --> 01:30:54,011
Get him!

1343
01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:03,228
Get him. Get Dad! Get Dad!

1344
01:31:03,313 --> 01:31:05,188
Come on, then!
