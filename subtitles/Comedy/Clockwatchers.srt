2
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,150

3
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,520
I think I'm supposed to work here today

4
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,040
sit here until someone comes here and tell you what to do

5
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,640
and read this while you're waiting

6
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,370
ah, my feet are killing me

7
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,360
who's the new girl?

8
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
she must be felling in for someone

9
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,600
I can't believe you've been waiting for 2 hours
why didn't you say something

10
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,740
well, eh,

11
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
they told me to wait here

12
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,940
well, I hope you can type, follow me

13
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,530
okay

14
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,090
type the information from this list

15
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,930
onto the invoice form and then when you done

16
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,930
you will make 3 copies of each

17
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,800
and the copy room is down the hall

18
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,590
um

19
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,620
try not to make too many mistake these forms are very expensive

20
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,680
[coughs]

21
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,060
[giggles]

22
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,620
hi, uh, you know what

23
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,170
this machine is not really working very well
you gotta use that one

24
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,140
damn, you know, I think

25
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,140
somebody put a curse on it 'cus it's jamming

26
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,530
alright

27
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,770
excuse me

28
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,550
you know, if you hit it evenly and put the

29
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,710
pressure down, is like, that smears that way works better

30
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,980
if you, when you're done, would you close it because it'll dry up so fast

31
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,320
[sniffs]

32
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,350
I like your shoes

33
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,100
I once read that there are two kinds of time

34
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,450
mechanical and human

35
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,730
You could say my story began at 8:59 the day I started that job

36
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,390
and ended months later, when I left it

37
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,610
But I'd tell you it began in the past

38
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,920
with my old self

39
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,600
and ended in the future

40
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,890
with the new one

41
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,940
[phone ringing]

42
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,640

55
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,190
figures, that's why they sent me over

56
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,340
they don't like our kind mingling with the permanents

57
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,550
there's phone call for Mr. Wheeler

58
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,060

59

60
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,040
people in siting in those glassrooms don't answer phone before 10

61
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,190
maybe I should take message

62
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,530

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,190
claimed she was a motorcycle accident

69
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,880

70
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,600

71
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,880

trying to look busy when there's nothing to do

91
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,550
they'll keep you here, that's how it works

92

you're part of the corporate hierarchy

93
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,530

but this place is so cheap

420
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,320
they don't wanna pay benefits, that's why they hired transients

421

422
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,490

465
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,020
you're just gotta get in there and promote yourself

466
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,900
you know what they say

467
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,120
a good salesman's born, not made

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,360
you know with your education and personality

478
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,520
__while you can take over a company

479
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,960
you just have to get on door

480
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,550
most people spend their life dreaming about future

481
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,800
everyday

482
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,430
events are taking place around us while we wait for them

483
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,010
unaware

484
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,300
little things

485
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,300
quiet things

486
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,390
you hardly even notice

487
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,770

488
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,280
french tip

489
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,520
french tip

490
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,670
maybe only you pay attention when
something announces itself with a shout

491
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,140
that's how it went in that office

492
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,260
we're all just killing time

493
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,040
waiting for something to happen

494
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,580
anything

495
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
and then one day

496
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,560
something did

497
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,170
thief, thief

498
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,060
the money from coffee can, it's missing

499
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,480
shouting in the office

500
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,330
harder__ than work with
-can you believe this

501
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,360
it's stupid

502
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,450
____

503
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,430
____

504
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,210
they wouldn't do that, I don't think so

505
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,890
so no
-they done stupider things, my dear

506
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,170
____

507
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,340
a handful of change

508
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,660
it seems small enough

509
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,060
but, did know what it meant at the time

510
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,440
didn't change our routine

511
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
still

512
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,480
maybe there was some thing in the air

513
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,240
like a spell I've been cast over the office

514
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,560
I wonder if there was anything to that fortune teller said

515
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
my ban___ though

516
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,470

here you go, watch out for me

521
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,990
people clung to the adventure

522
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:36,284
they look for ways to __draw it out

523
00:31:37,057 --> 00:31:39,964
some folks create their own traumas and practice their roles

524
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:41,404
and art

525
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,213

that night I thought about missing items at work

646
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:31,413
how every objects has it's own story

647
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,386
like a seashell

00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,022
or notebook

649
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,084

also it has come to my attention that some of you are making personal phone calls

665
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,622
that is against company policy

666
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,644
wow, you know what? I love your scarf

667
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:22,862

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,000
she was hanging around my desk other day when I was on the phone

679
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,071
I wonder she was the one ratted on me for making personal phone calls

680
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,466
I wonder she saw us leave early yesterday

681

01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:26,186
everything

1101
01:04:26,604 --> 01:04:27,688
you want some?

1102
01:04:27,688 --> 01:04:29,680

1103
01:04:32,897 --> 01:04:34,560

1104
01:04:35,182 --> 01:04:37,057

1105
01:04:37,857 --> 01:04:39,050
I get it

1106
01:04:40,382 --> 01:04:42,088
my mother know someone in cosmetics

1107
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,417

1111
01:04:59,902 --> 01:05:01,431
what are you depressed about

1112
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,093
you have a boyfriend, you're getting married

1113
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:05,090
at least you have a way out of this place

1114
01:05:05,626 --> 01:05:08,426
Iris, I'm scared

1115
01:05:08,693 --> 01:05:11,217
I think I was here like the night the wallet was stolen, I don't know

1116
01:05:11,822 --> 01:05:13,351
I can remeber

1117
01:05:13,422 --> 01:05:15,680
maybe I placuk__ out or something but

1118
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,640
I think I''m the guilty one and I did it _____

1119
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:22,350
I looking for wallet calling over the police, you know I can't find anywhere

1120
01:05:23,857 --> 01:05:25,991
oh god I don't know anything anymore

1121
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:30,400
__glad_ I didn't know something

1122
01:05:32,551 --> 01:05:34,773
god , __ we don know anything for sure

1123
01:05:35,582 --> 01:05:37,155
I don't know

1124
01:05:40,168 --> 01:05:41,982
I don't know

1125
01:05:56,604 --> 01:05:59,635
It's funny how doubt hides itself

1126
01:06:00,346 --> 01:06:02,453
It follows behind you

1127
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,924
It waits in every corner

1128
01:06:05,653 --> 01:06:07,324
You never see it coming

1129
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,653
But you feel it, on the inside

1130
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,191
Maybe it was just that office

1131
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:14,977
or maybe it was bigger than that

1132
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,280
it was all around. A million eyes

1133
01:06:17,386 --> 01:06:18,968
Watching

1134
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,960
Judging

1135
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:23,404
The whole wide world even

1136
01:06:24,577 --> 01:06:26,720
You feel so small

1137
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:08,897
could you come with me please

1138
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:26,746
we have a certain standard grooming we expect our employees to adhere to, and

1139
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:28,613
your shirt ham is hanging

1140
01:07:28,746 --> 01:07:30,951
I hope this isn't going to be a problem

1141
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:34,195
I really hate to have to replace people

1142
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:37,493
excuse me

1143
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:46,693
Iris

1144
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:48,062
what did she tell you?

1145
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:58,577
you don't tell me

1146
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,302
you should write that in your little notebook of yours

1147
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,097
it's fine

1148
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,835
do you know anybody might have financial needs?

1149
01:09:02,373 --> 01:09:03,511
no

1150
01:09:03,662 --> 01:09:05,164
how about a grievance

1151
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,893
you hearing any complaint about working environment or other personnel

1152
01:09:11,955 --> 01:09:13,875
anybody that's unhappy?

1153
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:21,626
let me ask you this

1154
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:24,000
how well do you know your co-workers

1155
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,488
because situation like this

1156
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:28,711
your perpetrator could be anybody

1157
01:09:29,173 --> 01:09:30,631
could be somebody

1158
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:32,986
you know very little about

1159
01:09:32,986 --> 01:09:34,980
or that might be somebody

1160
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,862
you think you know

1161
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,560
very well

1162
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:57,822

1163
01:09:58,115 --> 01:09:59,404

1164
01:10:02,844 --> 01:10:03,902

1166
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:08,595

01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,715

1168
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,226

1170
01:10:20,186 --> 01:10:21,573

1172
01:10:43,377 --> 01:10:44,888
what the hell?

1173
01:10:47,937 --> 01:10:49,448
did you see a notebook in there

1174
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,617
if you like report missing, we can add it to list

1175
01:10:51,724 --> 01:10:53,911
excuse me sir those are some of personal belongings

1176
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:54,977

01:10:58,026 --> 01:11:00,160

1179
01:11:00,284 --> 01:11:02,008

1180
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,337
Cleo's desk, Cleo with C, a big gold C

1181
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,377
why is __she all suspicious___

1182
01:11:12,586 --> 01:11:14,373
and you know what they're doing

1183
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,208
trying feel us guilty, so they can control us

1184
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,804
just want us to feel crappy about ourself

1185
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:21,733
man __ that everything we do

1186
01:11:21,822 --> 01:11:25,200
that's it I'm sick of it, I'm sick of being treated like a criminal

1187
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:27,786
remember that plan we had I think it's time follow through with it

1188
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,124
let's not show up tomorrow, see what's happens then

1189
01:11:30,133 --> 01:11:32,551
is everyone in?
-yeah sure

1190
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,060
oh, look, my finger puppet ___ incriminating evidence

1191
01:11:50,888 --> 01:11:52,426
you're like held one

1192
01:11:52,426 --> 01:11:54,420
__twice

1193
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,506
as a group you can really make big statement

1194
01:11:59,093 --> 01:12:02,382
it's a risk, but gotta take a risk, if you noticed

1195
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:03,893
they can treat us this way

1196
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:06,737
and they can't crush us in the silence

1197
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,848
tomorrow

1198
01:12:10,337 --> 01:12:11,493
you strike

1199
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:55,146
I eh, got scared, never missed a day before

1200
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,115
I changed my mind

1201
01:13:07,964 --> 01:13:10,444
I don't know about you guy but I need this job

1202
01:13:10,444 --> 01:13:12,440
you know, it's a little I've got

1203
01:13:20,151 --> 01:13:22,017
besides you know what was I just thinking?

1204
01:13:22,088 --> 01:13:25,831
maybe it's not her maybe that's just somebody want us think

1205
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:34,764
you konw what that cop told me?

1206
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,017
he said the guilty one is the first one who point fingers

1207
01:13:39,422 --> 01:13:42,240
maybe people stoped looking at me all the time

1208
01:13:46,373 --> 01:13:47,697
where's the other one?

1209
01:13:48,693 --> 01:13:50,373
um I don't know

1210
01:13:52,533 --> 01:13:55,564
it's not very professional she knows company policy

1211
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:57,560
must have call in if you're absent or late

1212
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,293
I think she's done this before

1213
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:23,804
I wish I could tell you I never doubt a friend

1214
01:14:24,275 --> 01:14:26,826
I wish could say that place hadn't gotten better of us

1215
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,373
but that's not the way it happened

1216
01:14:34,915 --> 01:14:38,746
Sometimes it hits you how quickly the present fades into the past

1217
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,471
and you question everything around you

1218
01:14:43,484 --> 01:14:45,884
you wonder if anything you'd ever do would matter

1219
01:14:46,346 --> 01:14:47,880
or if you could just disappear

1220
01:14:48,231 --> 01:14:49,880
without a trace

1221
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:55,137
hey, I thought of this crazy place all day

1222
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:58,915
yesterday I can wait hear what happened , they have to noticed right

1223
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,622
I noticed

1224
01:15:02,728 --> 01:15:05,013
did you checking in and out, or some thing?

1225
01:15:05,431 --> 01:15:07,010
Paula, what happened?

1226
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,426
if i were you I would keep my voice down okay, cus you're in a shitload of trouble

1227
01:15:17,502 --> 01:15:18,720
what happened?

1228
01:15:21,013 --> 01:15:22,462
I guess

1229
01:15:23,128 --> 01:15:24,460
I'm just

1230
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,106
not like you

1231
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,302
yah know it's sad, isn't it, how people always end up betraying each other?

1232
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:35,964
And for what?

1233
01:15:38,648 --> 01:15:40,311
can you read this while you're waiting

1234
01:15:41,635 --> 01:15:42,586
excuse me

1235
01:15:42,702 --> 01:15:44,115
you're in my seat

1236
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:46,382
there's a vacancy over there though

1237
01:15:50,622 --> 01:15:52,853
we won't be needing you here anymore

1238
01:15:54,915 --> 01:15:57,244
I was really sick yesterday Barbara

1239
01:15:57,431 --> 01:15:59,795

01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:14,853
Oh. You think I'm your little office thief

1246
01:16:14,995 --> 01:16:16,684
oh, you got me

1247
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,915
You finally got me
-come on

1248
01:16:18,915 --> 01:16:20,910

-you've got 15 seconds, lets go

1249
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:24,222

1250
01:16:24,426 --> 01:16:26,220

1251
01:16:26,853 --> 01:16:28,220
thank you

1252
01:16:29,386 --> 01:16:31,475
I had things you know

1253
01:16:34,862 --> 01:16:36,408
is anyone gonna say anything?

1254
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:41,324
you know I'm not a thief

1255
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:46,888
is anyone gonna say anything?

1256
01:16:48,657 --> 01:16:51,048
is anyone gonna say anything?

1257
01:16:52,702 --> 01:16:55,511
is anyone gotta stick out for me

1258
01:16:58,008 --> 01:17:00,044
is anyone gonna speak?

1259
01:17:02,728 --> 01:17:04,293
I have a name you know

1260
01:17:04,515 --> 01:17:05,493
it's Margaret

1261
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:08,888
Margaret with M, take a memo Barbara

1262
01:17:18,017 --> 01:17:20,835
I often wished I had that moment to live over

1263
01:17:21,271 --> 01:17:23,280
I wished I'd said something

1264
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:28,400
Soon afterward Jane left

1265
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,817
the wedding was beautiful

1266
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,253
I read about it in the newspaper

1267
01:17:35,546 --> 01:17:38,053
Paula got transferred to the accounting department

1268
01:17:38,284 --> 01:17:40,693
Once in a while they let her out to photocopy

1269
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:43,288
I like to imagine she kept up her singing

1270
01:17:46,951 --> 01:17:49,493
I had to change desks a few more times

1271
01:17:49,804 --> 01:17:52,160
It was easier to forget where I was that way

1272
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:56,151
And there was something else

1273
01:17:56,168 --> 01:17:57,530
the stealing stopped

1274
01:17:57,955 --> 01:18:00,711
I was almost beginning to think none of it had happened

1275
01:18:45,973 --> 01:18:48,568
Sometimes I thought about what Margaret said

1276
01:18:50,168 --> 01:18:52,595
About how a person can just drift through life

1277
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,590
like they're not connected to anyone

1278
01:18:55,048 --> 01:18:56,590
or anything

1279
01:19:00,142 --> 01:19:01,840
You look around

1280
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:05,795
all those characters trying to kill time

1281
01:19:06,026 --> 01:19:07,790
Going around in circles

1282
01:19:12,311 --> 01:19:15,084
Even if a person wanted to break free

1283
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:19,902
they could find out they've got nowhere else to go

1284
01:19:58,684 --> 01:20:03,200
listen I'm gonna be in the meeting shortly when I'm done just pop in the office, thanks

1285
01:20:29,155 --> 01:20:31,146
we never talked about it

1286
01:20:31,635 --> 01:20:33,140
we didn't have to

1287
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,635
there was nothing to say

1288
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,386
what she took from us

1289
01:21:39,386 --> 01:21:41,380
is more than she can put in her pocket

1290
01:21:41,742 --> 01:21:44,151
it was like she owed me something

1291
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,853
can you make 10 copies of this please

1292
01:25:03,928 --> 01:25:05,422
thanks

1293
01:25:59,235 --> 01:26:02,737
that girl Cleo, she wasn't so different than rest us

1294
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:05,137
she just wanted to be noticed

1295
01:26:05,395 --> 01:26:07,706
she wanted to be somebody

1296
01:26:09,182 --> 01:26:11,004
you have to make your mark

1297
01:26:15,271 --> 01:26:17,111
excuse me

1298
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:21,173
This is my last day here and I was wondering if you could give me a recommendation

1299
01:26:21,848 --> 01:26:23,431
I'd be glad to

1300
01:26:23,591 --> 01:26:27,057
Well, actually, I've already written something if you could just sign it

1301
01:26:35,751 --> 01:26:38,142
Well you've certainly been a big help here

1302
01:26:38,275 --> 01:26:40,604
Good luck to you, Margaret

1303
01:26:49,786 --> 01:26:51,591
Everything is temporary

1304
01:26:51,902 --> 01:26:54,231
Everything begins and ends

1305
01:26:54,453 --> 01:26:56,293
and sometimes begins again

1306
01:27:08,453 --> 01:27:10,266
When I look ahead

1307
01:27:10,551 --> 01:27:12,737
I imagine infinite possible futures

1308
01:27:12,862 --> 01:27:15,262
repeated like countless photocopies

1309
01:27:15,857 --> 01:27:17,848
a thousand blank pages

1310
01:27:18,915 --> 01:27:20,933
and in each one I see myself

1311
01:27:21,644 --> 01:27:23,377
never hiding

1312
01:27:24,737 --> 01:27:26,737
never sitting silently

1313
01:27:27,937 --> 01:27:29,848
and never just waiting

1314
01:27:29,964 --> 01:27:31,902
and waiting

1315
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,124
and watching the world go by

1316
01:27:37,902 --> 01:27:39,333
the end
