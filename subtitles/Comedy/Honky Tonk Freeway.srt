1
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,045
Okay, we've got a four-word sentence
here for you.

2
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,339
What is it, Vanessa ?

3
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,301
Vanessa, come on.

4
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,951
Here we go. "The".

5
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,932
"The" ?

6
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:16,231
"Ca-caa..."

7
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,900
Caa...

8
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:25,303
"Cat."

9
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,223
Perfect. You've got it.
Now let's continue to the third word.

10
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,787
"Dr..."

11
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,768
"Dr-en..."

12
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:35,209
Think "k", "kuh", followed by "s".

13
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:39,067
Think "kuh-s". "kuh-s".

14
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,048
Think.

15
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,864
"Drenks" ?

16
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,679
- "Drinks" ?
- You got it. That's it.

17
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:50,225
- "Drinks".
- You did it. Perfect.

18
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:54,083
Um, "The cat drinks...

19
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:58,671
milk."

20
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:03,050
That's right. Very good.
Great, Vanessa.

21
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:10,662
Vanessa ! Chopper !

22
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,189
Fully rewarded now ?

23
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,661
Hey, mister !
I've got my own place.

24
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:52,789
It's right over there in the motel.

25
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:55,396
You can turn right here and get in.
It's cooler.

26
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,002
Then can I get in the car with you ?

27
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,818
- I'll go wherever you wanna go.
- Move, bitch !

28
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:03,008
- No, thank you !
- Sir ! Sir !

29
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:06,240
Well, screw you too,
fuckin' nigger !

30
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:08,847
Mom ? What are you doin' ?

31
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:12,497
- What are you doin' home so early ?
- It's not so early, Mom.

32
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:16,250
- How you doin', Ms. Lutz ?
- Don't even talk to her, Chopper !

33
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:18,961
- Vanessa, I'm out of here.
- Okay.

34
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,820
- Will you give your mom my regards ?
- Will do, Ms. Lutz.

35
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:24,801
You said you weren't gonna
do this no more.

36
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:27,199
I've had enough crap
from your father all day.

37
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:29,597
- I am real stressed out...
- Larry is not my dad.

38
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:32,413
If you're gonna smart-ass me,
you can just go on home right now.

39
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,081
Get out of my face right now !

40
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:37,209
- Go on, get out !
- Fine.

41
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,233
- Fine.
- You don't know nothing' about nothin' !

42
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,779
You don't know
a goddamn thing about nothin' !

43
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,059
Larry, just let me through.

44
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,064
- What's the magic word ?
- Fuck you, you piece of shit.

45
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:00,775
"Fuck you" ?

46
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,269
How was school ?

47
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:18,815
Like you really
fuckin' care, asshole.

48
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:22,673
Me and your mama, we spent the whole day
in line securin' rent vouchers,

49
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,384
and we could both use
a little consideration !

50
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,768
Don't it bother you your own wife
bringin' off all them guys for money ?

51
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:37,167
I make her use mouthwash after.

52
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:39,565
You like that minty-fresh taste,
huh, Larry ?

53
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:42,693
Vanessa Lutz, I'm gettin' ready
to take a seriously big shit

54
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,987
right on top of that
pointy little head of yours !

55
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:47,073
Don't be a smart-ass.

56
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:50,722
Hey, motherfucker.

57
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:57,083
- You want some company ?
- Yeah.

58
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,064
Oh, let me get in.

59
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:01,150
<i>You get the luckiest breaks.</i>

60
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,861
<i>And I mean lucky.
What else could it be ?</i>

61
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:07,615
<i>We interrupt this program to go live
to L.A. County Sheriff's headquarters,</i>

62
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:10,221
<i>where a press conference
is now in progress...</i>

63
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,516
<i>regarding the grisly find
yesterday morning</i>

64
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:14,914
<i>along San Diego Freeway
in Torrance.</i>

65
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:18,980
<i>The two females have been
identified as 19-year-old...</i>

66
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,109
<i>Tempest Mueller of Downey,
and 16-year-old...</i>

67
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:25,758
<i>Corky Poindexter of Bellflower.</i>

68
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:30,033
<i>Both females have extensive
arrest records for prostitution,</i>

69
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,579
<i>and we are now considering them
as victims of the individual</i>

70
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:38,063
<i>that we call the I-5 Killer.</i>

71
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,044
<i>I'll take a few questions.</i>

72
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:44,840
- I happened to be watchin' that, Larry !
- Forget it.

73
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:47,760
You just don't want me
hearin' about that killer out there.

74
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,827
But what if he drove up right
this second and snatched up Mom, huh ?

75
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:54,642
What would you have
to say then, smart guy ?

76
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,770
First of all,
your mama would kick his ass.

77
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:03,193
And second of all, that killer
is all the way up in L.A., okay ?

78
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,697
<i>My dog's better than your dog</i>

79
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:30,721
<i>My dog's better than yours</i>

80
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,432
<i>My dog's better
'cause he gets Ken-L Ration</i>

81
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:36,560
<i>My dog's better than yours</i>

82
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:39,375
Larry, get your goddamn hands
off of my anatomy !

83
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:42,399
- Or I swear to fucking God...
- What ?

84
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,902
- What are you gonna do ?
- I'll tell Mom.

85
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:48,447
Oh, yeah, like she's
really gonna believe you.

86
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:50,950
I'm really not up
to your shit today, Larry.

87
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:54,078
- Fact, I'm mad as hell at you now.
- Aw, come here.

88
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:56,164
Goddamn it, Larry !

89
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:58,353
Get your fuckin' hands off me,
you shithead !

90
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:02,629
Fucker !

91
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:06,382
You hit hard !

92
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:12,639
Now you just behave.

93
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:14,933
Fuck, you hit hard.

94
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,227
You know, I can't help you

95
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,938
if you don't tell me
what it is you want.

96
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:23,900
Well, maybe we'd better
just forget the whole thing.

97
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:26,194
No.

98
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:29,010
I bet you like havin'
your wiener sucked.

99
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:32,868
- Hmm ? Don't you ?
- Yeah, I guess so.

100
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,517
How come that doesn't
surprise me ?

101
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:39,646
What would a thing
like that cost ?

102
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,627
Thirty dollars.

103
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:47,362
Sheriff's Department.
You're under arrest.

104
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,784
Let go !

105
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:59,145
Come on, guys, I didn't do anything.
I did nothing wrong.

106
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,647
- Take it easy.
- Come on.

107
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:04,567
Where do you think you're going ?

108
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,842
You're hurtin' me !
You're hurtin' my arm !

109
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,160
What's your name, Miss ?

110
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:15,829
Ramona Lutz.

111
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,601
Bully !

112
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:22,502
- Stayin' at this motel ?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:28,967
I never saw that before in my life,
and that's God's truth, sir.

114
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:31,261
You're telling me this
brown residue isn't narcotics ?

115
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,347
It doesn't belong to me.

116
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:36,162
What is that ? Speed ?
You look like a speedy kind of gal.

117
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,247
Officer, please, listen to me.

118
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,229
My little girl...

119
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:44,295
she's home with me now, and she just
got out of Children's Services,

120
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:47,945
and I cannot afford to be busted again
because they'll take her away from me.

121
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:49,405
They'll just take my baby away.

122
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:52,533
You know this pipe
constitutes probable cause,

123
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,931
so we're gonna have to take
a look inside your motel room.

124
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,894
You can't do that.
My husband's asleep.

125
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:02,230
- Your husband know you're soliciting ?
- Give us a fuckin' break.

126
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:06,401
- Your husband own a firearm, Ramona ?
- My Larry is on parole.

127
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:09,634
He hasn't had a firearm
for a long time.

128
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:12,032
We're gonna be real unhappy
if you're not tellin' us the truth.

129
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,118
I am tellin' you the truth, okay ?

130
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,099
Come on. Let's go.

131
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:19,436
You guys are makin' me
wish I was dead.

132
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:23,607
You fuckin' happy about that ?
Are you fuckin' happy about that ?

133
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,901
Cut that out right now
or you're gonna be hogtied !

134
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:29,654
- But if you just listen to me !
- Shut your mouth now !

135
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,740
Not another word !

136
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:41,959
Sheriff's Department, Larry.

137
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:45,504
<i>- Oh, yes !
- We need to talk to you a minute.</i>

138
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,424
Hey ! What the fuck !

139
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:51,865
- Oh, shit !
- Who's the girl, Larry ?

140
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:54,889
- Tryin' to take my baby away.
- You're diddlin' the daughter, Larry ?

141
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:57,078
What kind of question is that ?

142
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,102
- You mean...
- Get her outta here !

143
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,918
Hey, come on now.
She ain't my real daughter.

144
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:06,359
And besides,
nothin's goin' on, right ?

145
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:09,800
- Just who is this man to you ?
- He's my stepfather.

146
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:12,094
Take him into the other room
and I'll talk to the juvenile.

147
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:15,326
I got a pit in my shoulder,
and if you don't cuff me in front,

148
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,872
I'm gonna sue the police department
until there's no fuckin' tomorrow !

149
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,270
- You son of a bitch !
- What's your name ?

150
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,024
Vanessa Lutz.

151
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,735
Well, kid, I sure don't envy
your situation here.

152
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:30,029
My parents is just goin' through
a hard time is all

153
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:32,323
with the finances and everything.

154
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,972
Well, I see they still got
enough money left over to buy drugs.

155
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,726
I wouldn't be comfortable talkin'
about that sort of thing, ma'am.

156
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:46,504
I'm goin' to ask you a question, okay ?
Don't get upset. It's important.

157
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:53,490
Is there some sort of sexual activity
between your stepfather and yourself ?

158
00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:00,685
- Elevator up.
- Come here, baby.

159
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,709
- We are so fucked.
- What are you laughin' at ?

160
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,420
We are so fucked.

161
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:09,653
Oh, don't take my baby away !
Oh, please !

162
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,885
If you love her so much, how come
you don't clean up around here ?

163
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,075
I do clean up, sir.

164
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:17,578
It just happens that
I'm under a great deal of stress.

165
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:20,497
My sister happened to die
three months ago in Washington,

166
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:23,313
- and I'm tryin' to get off methadone !
- You're on methadone ?

167
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,128
Will you please
give me a cigarette ?

168
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:29,465
- I told you to keep quiet.
- Please give her a cigarette.

169
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,863
- Please.
- Are you mad at me ?

170
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,053
Honey ?

171
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,347
I'm not mad, Mom.

172
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:40,309
Please don't be mad.
Come over here, give me a big hug.

173
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:43,542
Come on. I ain't gonna see you
for a long time, baby.

174
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,002
Come on.

175
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:49,381
Oh, baby. Oh.

176
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:51,988
I am so sorry, Pooh Bear.

177
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:54,073
I'm so sorry.

178
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:58,557
You still love me ?

179
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:01,477
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you more.

180
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,733
Here.

181
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,308
Would you get this...

182
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:22,227
Tell this piece of shit
to get his knee out of my neck !

183
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:25,981
Bye, Ramona !
I love you !

184
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,152
I love you !

185
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,409
Watch her head.

186
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,328
- I'll go in the other car.
- Get her outta here.

187
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,978
Bye, Ramona !

188
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:46,940
- Children's Services are on their way.
- Oh, that's just great.

189
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,547
No offense, kid, but anything's
an improvement over this.

190
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,325
What do you think we ought to do ?
Just leave you here ?

191
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,538
I could stay with you
for a couple of weeks.

192
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:04,354
- Are you kidding ?
- No, I'm serious.

193
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,169
I could do all sorts of chores
while you was out messin' people up.

194
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,672
We're not allowed
to do things like that.

195
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,468
- You're lyin'.
- No, I'm not.

196
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:18,848
If you don't want to, all you had to do
was just say it straight out.

197
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:21,142
I don't want to.

198
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,521
Okay, then.

199
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,058
Hey, Mrs. Sheets.
Guess you heard the news.

200
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,082
Hello, Vanessa. I heard your mother
might be away for awhile.

201
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:48,462
This is her third arrest this year.
She's lookin' at six months, mandatory.

202
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:51,590
We're holding the stepfather
on multiple parole violations.

203
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:54,822
Oh, I am so sorry
about all this, Vanessa.

204
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,055
- I can take over here now, Officer.
- Good luck, kid.

205
00:15:58,062 --> 00:16:01,704
Yeah, right. Come on over
and ruin my life again real soon.

206
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,998
You don't have to be
so hard on the officer.

207
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,231
She just took my whole family
off to jail, okay ?

208
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,634
I hate pigs so much,
Mrs. Sheets.

209
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:22,663
Come on, now.
Let's go gather up some of your things.

210
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,479
You're puttin' me in foster care
again, aren't you ?

211
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:30,171
Honey, I'm willing to consider any
alternative you'd like to suggest, but...

212
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:32,778
My grandma would
be an alternative.

213
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:35,489
This is the first
I've heard of any grandma.

214
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:39,034
On my father's side.
My real father. See ?

215
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:42,580
She'd take me in, most likely.

216
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,978
You don't sound too sure.

217
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:47,272
Actually, she don't
know about me yet.

218
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,400
That's not gonna do us
much good for tonight.

219
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,363
Why haven't you been
in touch with her before now ?

220
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,491
Before I was born, there was this
bad blood between her and my mom,

221
00:16:57,498 --> 00:17:00,306
and there must've been
some harsh words spoke...

222
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:04,686
because my mom threw this chemical
on her face that burned her skin a bit.

223
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,875
Lovely.

224
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:10,212
I tried gettin' her on the phone once,
but she ain't listed.

225
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,132
If I could get up to Stockton,
I know I'd find her.

226
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:16,364
- Just like that, huh ?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:21,369
Oh, my God.

228
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:24,185
I know what I need.

229
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:27,522
Mrs. Sheets, could you come in here
and fold up my blanket ?

230
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,441
- This one ?
- Yeah, that one.

231
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,778
- What do you want with this old thing ?
- My mama gave it to me.

232
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,864
What are you doing ?
What... ?

233
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:40,452
Oh, shit ! Sorry.
Let me get you turned around.

234
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,580
Vanessa, this is not funny !

235
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,542
I'm not laughin', Mrs. Sheets.

236
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:51,400
Now, if you yell loud enough,
Mr. Wong will come and set you free.

237
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:54,529
He's the day manager.
I'll leave the keys on top of the TV.

238
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,927
Vanessa, you come back here !

239
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,778
Where the fuck are you, Chopper ?

240
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:50,523
Chopper !

241
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:55,529
Chopper, we're fucked.
We're totally fucked.

242
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:58,970
Just after you left, the pigs came
and pinched Mom and Larry both.

243
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:01,368
Then my parole officer showed up
like the motherfuckin' plague

244
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:05,226
to take me off to foster care again,
just like last time.

245
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,648
So how did you get here ?

246
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:13,568
I cuffed her ankle to the bed.

247
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:17,843
- That wasn't very smart, Vanessa.
- I know, I know.

248
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,118
I'm goin' up north, and unless you never
wanna see me again, you better get in.

249
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:25,247
I gotta be in court next week
for sentencing.

250
00:19:25,254 --> 00:19:30,252
If I don't show, I'm gonna get
a year at Camp Gonzalez for sure.

251
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:34,527
I guess I'm on my own.

252
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:36,717
Where up north are you goin' ?

253
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:39,741
My grandma's up in Stockton.

254
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:42,660
- You got any money ?
- No.

255
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,922
Sell that when you get
where you're goin'.

256
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:55,903
It's from Spain.

257
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,595
I love you so much, Chopper.

258
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,785
I love you too, baby.

259
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,995
Oh, here.

260
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:28,019
Take this.

261
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:36,674
I gotta go.

262
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,259
Bye, Chopper,
my beloved boyfriend.

263
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,194
Pinche, mirate.

264
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:33,565
Damn fucking car.

265
00:22:34,615 --> 00:22:37,110
Didn't know that
today it would pass.

266
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:44,305
Fuck.

267
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,141
You havin' some kind of trouble ?

268
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:10,165
The fucking cocksucker
won't even fucking turn over !

269
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:15,691
- Excuse my bad language, sir.
- It's all right.

270
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:18,924
- Would you mind if I take a look ?
- Go for it.

271
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:22,469
Get behind the wheel there
and step on the gas for me.

272
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:27,996
Try it.

273
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:33,314
Again.

274
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:43,950
I hate to break the news to you,
but this car's had it.

275
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:47,078
- I knew it was only a matter of time.
- Where are you headed ?

276
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:49,268
My grandma's up in Stockton.

277
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:52,709
Well, I'm goin' as far as L.A.
You're welcome to ride with me.

278
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:54,690
- Really, mister ?
- Sure.

279
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:57,922
- Grab your stuff and let's go.
- Thanks !

280
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:27,432
I guess we oughta call a tow truck.

281
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:31,811
<i>Nah. Caltrans will take care of it.
My mom used to work part-time for them.</i>

282
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:35,461
- So what do I call you ?
- Sorry. My name is Bob Wolverton.

283
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:38,693
- I'm Vanessa Lutz.
- It's nice to meet you, Vanessa.

284
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:41,196
Put on your safety belt
and we'll get goin'.

285
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,722
Great.

286
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:57,984
What's this all about ?

287
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:00,799
It's a psychological manual.
I use it in my work.

288
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:04,136
I'm a counselor at a school
for boys with emotional trouble.

289
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:06,847
Just boys, huh ?
No girls at all ?

290
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:08,828
I'm afraid so.

291
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:14,876
So how does your family feel about
this trip of yours up to Stockton ?

292
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:17,692
I don't got no family
just at the moment.

293
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:20,298
Vanessa, everybody's got a family.

294
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:23,010
Shows how much you know.

295
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:27,389
- You wanna talk about it ?
- Not really.

296
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:29,057
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:33,228
It's an unfortunate habit of mine,
sticking my nose where it shouldn't be.

298
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:35,418
That's a bad habit.

299
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:38,755
Well, don't rub it in, okay ?
It's just my work.

300
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:43,239
I see a kid who looks like they're in
trouble, and I start askin' questions.

301
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:45,741
I guess it's just
become second nature.

302
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,035
It's that obvious ?

303
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:51,581
- What is ?
- Me being in trouble.

304
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:54,292
Look, the offer's still open
if you want it.

305
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:59,088
You know,
I've always found it amazing how...

306
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:02,216
how much easier it is to really share
something with a perfect stranger...

307
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:04,719
stuff that you couldn't even
talk to with your friends or family.

308
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:06,387
I noticed that.

309
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:08,786
- That's real funny.
- Yeah, it is.

310
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:12,122
Most of the kids I work with, I don't
press 'em to talk about themselves.

311
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,312
I just let them know I'm there,

312
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,440
and that they can talk
about themselves if they want to.

313
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:25,782
I guess my biggest problem
right now is...

314
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,555
my mama's in jail.

315
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:31,934
Vanessa, that sounds like
a pretty bad situation.

316
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:34,541
Yeah, but that's why
I'm goin' to see my grandma.

317
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,485
Would you mind me asking
why your mother's in jail ?

318
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:42,258
It's pretty embarrassing.

319
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:44,552
Why would you be embarrassed
about another person's acts ?

320
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,846
I don't know, it's just...

321
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:50,182
I mean, I don't feel comfortable
talkin' about stuff like that

322
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,770
'cause I think it makes me
look like a low-type person.

323
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,794
Well, I can understand that.

324
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:01,652
Most of the boys I work with,
even the most troubled ones...

325
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,468
all they really need is just
someone to listen to 'em.

326
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:10,411
Yeah, but you probably get so sick
of hearin' them sad stories every day.

327
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:13,018
I don't.
I really love my work.

328
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:17,398
I couldn't imagine myself
doing anything else. Not ever.

329
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,740
Guess I wouldn't mind
talkin' to someone.

330
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:30,328
I just wouldn't know
where to begin.

331
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,229
Why don't you begin with your mother ?
I mean, if you want to.

332
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:39,400
My mama's a whore.

333
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:50,035
Thanks, mister.

334
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,017
I mean, Bob.

335
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,206
There.

336
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,586
I can't believe
I'm tellin' you all this stuff.

337
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,904
My mama's in jail.

338
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:07,866
It looks like my stepfather's next
parole officer ain't even been born yet.

339
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,663
Vanessa, you really
don't have anyone, do you ?

340
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,441
That's terrible.

341
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,612
Oh, that's just terrible.

342
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,740
My real dad was this
merchant marine out of Texas,

343
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,555
but he got stabbed to death
on one of them container ships...

344
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:32,996
by this man from Pakistan
before I was born.

345
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,707
You wanna see his picture
I got right here ?

346
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,376
Absolutely.

347
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,068
That's my daddy.

348
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,803
- He looks very interesting.
- You think ?

349
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,557
- Absolutely.
- I think so, too.

350
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,642
Your grandmother's gonna be very proud

351
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,562
when she finds out what
a wonderful granddaughter she's got.

352
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,690
But I have to be honest with you.

353
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:02,089
I think given
your present situation,

354
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:05,321
maybe foster care would be
the way you should go right now.

355
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:09,492
Bob, sometimes them places are okay,
but most of the time,

356
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:13,142
them people are just in it for the check
that the state sends for your upkeep.

357
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,540
I take it you've had
some bad experiences.

358
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:19,294
The last one I was in, there was an old
man that everyone called "grandpa",

359
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:23,465
<i>and he had this disease called
Wisenheimers, I think it was...</i>

360
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:27,010
where your brain cells
run out into your pee.

361
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:32,328
- It's a form of senility.
- Here's your check, sir.

362
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:37,229
Thanks, Bob. That's the best
fuckin' dinner I've had all month.

363
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:42,964
I wouldn't mind stretchin' my legs
before I got behind the wheel. You mind ?

364
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,448
No. Sure.
I got all the time in the world.

365
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:48,282
Great.

366
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:52,557
So them foster parents,
the Moraleses...

367
00:29:52,564 --> 00:29:55,372
you would've thought a check
from the state would've been enough.

368
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,396
But no, they figured on me
helpin' out with Grandpa, too.

369
00:29:58,404 --> 00:30:01,837
- You had to provide care for this man ?
- Get crucial.

370
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:04,549
This guy was pissin' his sheets
nearly every night.

371
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:07,781
Just bein' near him
made me want to puke my guts out.

372
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:10,075
So what happened
when you refused ?

373
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:13,620
They just started treatin' me like I was
the biggest bitch who'd ever been born.

374
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:18,521
Then this one night, just a couple weeks
after I'd been placed there,

375
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:21,754
I woke up to see Grandpa standin'
over me with his cane in one hand...

376
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:24,152
and his you-know-what
in the other.

377
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,029
My God.
What happened ?

378
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:29,887
- I told him to get the hell out.
- I take it he didn't.

379
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,119
No. That's when he tried to
slip it under the covers with me,

380
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:35,831
and I just went crazy on him.

381
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:38,437
What do you mean,
you went crazy ?

382
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,836
I was pissed off
'cause I couldn't see my mom,

383
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:43,860
and havin' this perv standin' over me
waggin' his thing in my face

384
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,841
was just the last straw.

385
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:48,135
So what did you do ?

386
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:50,429
Well, I got up on my knees,

387
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:54,183
and just slapped his dentures
half out of his face.

388
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,415
And then I dropped down on his chest
and just started whalin' on him,

389
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,961
beatin' him up so hard
and swearin' so loud.

390
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,525
My God.

391
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:05,966
So then the lights went on, and
Mr. Morales showed up in his pajamas.

392
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:09,615
- Well, thank God he was there.
- Yeah, right.

393
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:14,308
Hit me so hard, I had to have my jaw
wired shut for nearly three months.

394
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:18,166
Broke my nose, too.
That's how come it's so big.

395
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:23,901
Your nose is not big.

396
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:27,238
It's pretty damn big.

397
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,034
Was this man ever punished ?

398
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:36,622
Are you kidding ?
A pillar of society like Mr. Morales ?

399
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:40,272
No. But my mom got out of rehab
a couple days later

400
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,879
so I didn't have to
go back or nothin'.

401
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:47,779
You were telling me a little while ago
that your stepdad was on parole.

402
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:51,533
Oh, yeah.
Larry's been in lots of pens

403
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:55,496
like this one federal place
up in Illinois, Marion.

404
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:57,998
It's just mostly for drug shit.

405
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:02,691
Manufacturing methamphetamines,
stolen property...

406
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:04,880
but nothin' real, real bad.

407
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:10,407
Vanessa, please don't be offended
by my next question...

408
00:32:10,414 --> 00:32:12,388
but...

409
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:16,976
did your stepfather molest you ?

410
00:32:19,382 --> 00:32:21,251
Oh, my God.

411
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:28,655
This policewoman just asked me that
very same question just a few hours ago.

412
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,409
And how did that make you feel ?

413
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:36,997
Like I got "Daddy's Fuckhole"
tattooed on my forehead.

414
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:39,603
Maybe this is an issue
you should explore.

415
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,713
I never even told my fiance
about this stuff.

416
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,050
Vanessa, if you keep something
like this bottled up inside,

417
00:32:48,057 --> 00:32:49,927
it could wreck your whole life.

418
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:53,263
Now you're scarin' me.

419
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,453
That's not my intention.

420
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,956
I just think you have a very good
opportunity now to get through

421
00:32:57,963 --> 00:33:01,814
some of the trauma and anguish you've
been suffering from for a long time.

422
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:05,463
I do got trauma, huh ?

423
00:33:05,471 --> 00:33:07,966
Let's not kid ourselves, Vanessa.

424
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,033
I've been so anguished...

425
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,848
I can't even remember bein' happy.

426
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:18,393
Vanessa, you have to
look this pain in the eye.

427
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:21,417
Otherwise it could rule over
every aspect of your life.

428
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:24,963
Now, I think I can help you

429
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,257
but you're going
to have to trust me.

430
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,636
You're going to
have to let me in.

431
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:37,788
My God, you're cold.

432
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:40,708
Just thinkin' about
my fucked-up life is all.

433
00:33:48,744 --> 00:33:50,197
Let's go.

434
00:33:52,394 --> 00:33:54,889
I'm sorry.

435
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:59,060
Here I am, blubberin' like a big old
baby, and you're just tryin' to help me.

436
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:02,292
Vanessa, Vanessa,
just take your time.

437
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,378
Take your time.

438
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:15,327
I was 11 when Larry first held me.

439
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:20,332
Where was your mother ?

440
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,939
Some stupid halfway house.

441
00:34:25,553 --> 00:34:28,361
How did the abuse begin ?

442
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:32,845
With my mama gone, I had all these
extra chores that I had to do,

443
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:35,556
like the laundry and the groceries
and things like that.

444
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:37,537
So you became
the woman of the house.

445
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:39,831
Yeah.

446
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,376
Yeah, and I was
so proud of myself.

447
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:48,590
And then this one night,
we were just watchin' TV after dinner

448
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:51,197
like we always do,

449
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:53,595
and that's when Larry told me...

450
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:58,496
that one of Mama's chores had always
been to massage his you-know-what.

451
00:35:01,006 --> 00:35:03,605
Did Larry expose himself to you ?

452
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:06,212
All through the show.

453
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:09,445
Did Larry have an erection ?

454
00:35:09,452 --> 00:35:11,947
That's puttin' it mildly.

455
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,223
Did he ask you to perform
oral sex for him ?

456
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:21,958
At first, I mean, he just had me
hold on to his you-know-what

457
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:25,086
durin' whatever
happened to be on TV.

458
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:29,465
He didn't get around to the other thing
you just mentioned for a while.

459
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:33,011
I guess he figured
if he went all slow-like,

460
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:36,139
I wouldn't freak-out
and get him in trouble.

461
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:39,580
But back then, I didn't even know
that stuff we was doin' was criminal.

462
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:43,438
Vanessa, victims often blame themselves.
It's a common occurrence.

463
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:47,922
But make no mistake about it :
you are the victim.

464
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:51,258
- Really, Bob ?
- Absolutely.

465
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:56,159
I was such a baby, I didn't even know
why men wanted that stuff done to them.

466
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,870
Vanessa, my God, you were a child.

467
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:01,164
You must have been so confused.

468
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:03,667
You know, and...

469
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:08,047
and when he did that thing
that you mentioned for the first time...

470
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:13,052
I swear to Christ, I thought he was
goin' to the bathroom in my mouth.

471
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:23,375
Do I have your absolute trust ?

472
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:28,797
I guess I trust you more than I've ever
trusted anyone in my whole life, Bob.

473
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:31,925
And I really mean that.

474
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:34,845
Thank you.
The reason why I'm asking...

475
00:36:34,852 --> 00:36:39,120
there's this powerful new psychological
technique that I'd like to try on you.

476
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:41,101
I think it could really help you.

477
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:43,187
Would you like to give it a try ?

478
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:44,959
Yeah, sure.

479
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,253
It consists of
a battery of questions

480
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:50,799
that are designed to trigger
certain elements of your subconscious.

481
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:52,988
I've gotta warn you, Vanessa...

482
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:56,534
this technique,
it can be uncomfortable.

483
00:36:57,062 --> 00:36:58,828
Go for it, Bob.

484
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:01,643
I mean, if you think
it's gonna help me.

485
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,544
Okay. Let's get started.
Are you ready ?

486
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:11,028
A few moments ago, you were
telling me that you felt like

487
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:12,905
Larry had gone to the bathroom
in your mouth.

488
00:37:12,912 --> 00:37:15,824
Those were your exact words.
Do you remember ?

489
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:18,953
Now at that exact moment,
when Larry ejaculated in your mouth,

490
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,664
did you feel as though somehow
you were being transformed...

491
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:24,792
into some kind of a human urinal ?

492
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:27,607
What kind of fucking questions
are these, Bob ?

493
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:30,110
You have to answer with the first thing
that comes into your mind.

494
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:32,717
It's very important.

495
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:35,115
- I knew I was flesh and blood.
- I understand that.

496
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:37,930
But you have to tell me
exactly how you felt.

497
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:42,101
You have to learn how to express
your feelings out loud.

498
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,566
I felt just like you said.

499
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:54,823
Say it out loud, Vanessa.

500
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,871
I felt like I had been

501
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,895
transformed into a human urinal.

502
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:17,033
That's very good, Vanessa.
Very good.

503
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:21,517
Now tell me this,
and this is absolutely crucial.

504
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:23,185
Are you ready ?

505
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:31,423
Did Larry try to fuck you ?

506
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,864
Oh, God.

507
00:38:34,871 --> 00:38:37,366
He tried, later on.

508
00:38:41,858 --> 00:38:45,083
Did you like it
when Larry fucked you ?

509
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:48,732
You piece of shit !

510
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:54,154
- I told you this can get uncomfortable.
- Pull on over right now !

511
00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:56,136
- We're not finished yet.
- Yes, we are !

512
00:38:56,143 --> 00:38:58,847
We are definitely finished.
Now you pull on over !

513
00:38:58,854 --> 00:39:01,766
You can suffer irreparable damage
if you break it off like this !

514
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:04,790
- I don't give a goddamn !
- Jesus Christ !

515
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:07,814
Piece of shit !
Fuckin' pervert !

516
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:10,213
- Jesus Christ !
- Where's the door handle ?

517
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,715
You lookin' for this ?

518
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,261
- Now you just settle down !
- I'm gonna kill you !

519
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:20,223
I'm gonna slit your fuckin' throat.
Is that what you want me to fuckin' do ?

520
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,308
Okay ! I'm stoppin', okay ?

521
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:25,228
You get down on the floor
and get my fuckin' car keys

522
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:27,835
and you put them in the ignition.

523
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:31,276
You know, you wouldn't like it
if someone was doin' that to you.

524
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:33,257
You're probably right, Vanessa.

525
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:36,281
- I doubt I would like it.
- Then stop it !

526
00:39:36,288 --> 00:39:39,096
I will stop it
if you promise to behave.

527
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:40,765
I promise I'll behave.

528
00:39:44,943 --> 00:39:48,377
- Are you that guy on the news ?
- I'm sorry ?

529
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:51,401
Are you the guy that's been killin'
all them girls on the freeway ?

530
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:55,676
Why are you killin'
all them girls, Bob ?

531
00:39:55,683 --> 00:39:59,534
'Cause I've reached my fucking limit
with people like you, Vanessa.

532
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:02,767
- What kind of people am I ?
- The alcoholics, the drug addicts...

533
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,165
the fathers who fuck
their daughters...

534
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:07,772
the drug-addicted motherfuckin' whores
with their bastard...

535
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:10,379
Hey, I ain't no trick baby !

536
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:15,279
I call them "garbage people",
and I assure you, you are one of them.

537
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,844
I am not.

538
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:20,493
Look at you. You're already a master
at the manipulation of men.

539
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,057
I didn't run nothin' on you.

540
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:25,707
It's so intrinsic to your fuckin' nature,
you're not even aware when you do it.

541
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,816
Stupid bitch.

542
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,599
What, you think it's okay to do
all sorts of bad stuff to me now ?

543
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:47,083
That's an open-ended discussion, dealing
with deep philosophical ramifications...

544
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,377
something you could hardly grasp.

545
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:54,069
Take it from me, a professional,
you're an absolute fucking moron.

546
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,676
You know,
maybe I ain't smart like you,

547
00:40:56,683 --> 00:40:59,804
and maybe I haven't finished school,
but at least I ain't a hypocrite.

548
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,018
Vanessa, please indulge me.
Tell me why I am a hypocrite.

549
00:41:06,485 --> 00:41:08,980
You act like you's all on
some sort of mission,

550
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:12,734
but all you wanna do is
just get off in a sex-type way.

551
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:17,218
Are you gonna do sex to me now ?

552
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:22,953
I promise you, if we get really,
really intimate,

553
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,873
you're gonna be
way past being offended.

554
00:41:27,757 --> 00:41:30,356
What, are you gonna
fuck me when I'm dead ?

555
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:37,134
Mister, I'm a person !
I'm a human being !

556
00:41:37,142 --> 00:41:40,471
Yeah, like that drug addict
fuckin' whore of a mother of yours ?

557
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:43,078
I sure wouldn't want
to meet your mom, Bob.

558
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:48,500
What, you can talk about my mom
but I can't talk about yours ?

559
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,211
We are not here
to talk about me, Vanessa !

560
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:55,382
We are here to talk about you,
so get your fuckin' pants down !

561
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:57,363
Please just let me go, Bob.

562
00:41:57,371 --> 00:41:58,823
Goddamn it !

563
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,681
Get your fuckin' pants down,
you fuckin' cunt !

564
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:04,245
What'd you call me ?

565
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:06,227
Get your fuckin' pants down now !

566
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:10,293
Okay, but look, I got these boots

567
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:13,734
and I got all them laces and stuff,
so give me a minute.

568
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,611
Hurry up.

569
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:23,745
Fucking bitch !

570
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:26,247
I'm gonna fuckin'
kill you, Vanessa.

571
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:28,541
- You just settle down, Bob.
- Okay.

572
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:31,148
You just settle down right now !

573
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:33,442
Drop that razor out the window.

574
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:36,570
If you try anything,
I'm gonna shoot you so many times !

575
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:43,974
You should've just let me out of the car
when I asked you to, Bob !

576
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:46,163
You see where
bad manners get you ?

577
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:48,875
Listen, Vanessa, look.
I just...

578
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:51,690
I've heard all I'm gonna
hear out of you.

579
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:53,984
- Fuck !
- So there !

580
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:56,382
Jesus Christ !

581
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:00,762
That's for trickin' me into tellin' you
all them things I never told my fiance !

582
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,516
Jesus Christ !
We're gonna get into an accident !

583
00:43:04,523 --> 00:43:07,644
And that's for cuttin' off
all my hair, you fucker !

584
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,668
Vanessa, you're upset, okay ?
You have every right to be.

585
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:15,047
Something dark and terrible came
over me, but I wasn't gonna hurt you.

586
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:18,280
- You gotta believe that.
- Yeah, right ! I'm so sure !

587
00:43:18,287 --> 00:43:22,659
I'm serious. I just wanted to scare you.
I don't even know why.

588
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:26,413
Vanessa, it's obvious to me right now
I'm a profoundly sick man.

589
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,499
I won't argue with you there.

590
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:32,774
Anyone who'd do sex to a dead person
is definitely sick, mister.

591
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,964
See ? You just admitted it.
I'm a sick...

592
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:37,466
Bob, shut up !
Shut up !

593
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,287
Son of a bitch.

594
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:52,586
Vanessa ? What are you
thinking right now ?

595
00:43:52,593 --> 00:43:55,297
You wanna hear more of my
innermost fuckin' secrets ?

596
00:43:55,304 --> 00:43:57,070
- No.
- Fuckin' asshole.

597
00:43:57,077 --> 00:43:59,989
No. I was just wondering
what you were planning on doing.

598
00:43:59,996 --> 00:44:03,743
I'm gonna turn you in to the
fuckin' pigs, that's what I'm gonna do !

599
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:10,208
You know what'll happen then,
don't you ?

600
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:13,753
Yeah. You'll end up
suckin' gas at San Quentin.

601
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:16,569
- Vanessa.
- You just might.

602
00:44:16,576 --> 00:44:21,261
Vanessa, people like me,
we don't go to the gas chamber.

603
00:44:21,268 --> 00:44:23,972
Then you'll go to the penitentiary,
where the mighty Aryan Brotherhood

604
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:26,058
will make you wish
you'd never been born.

605
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:31,063
The likelihood of someone like me
goin' to prison is absolutely nil.

606
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,461
You think they're
just goin' to let you walk ?

607
00:44:33,468 --> 00:44:36,902
It'll be like that time
Mr. Morales broke your jaw.

608
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:40,030
- You think so, huh ?
- Absolutely.

609
00:44:40,038 --> 00:44:43,784
They won't take me for a killer.
They'll let me go free.

610
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:46,182
They'll send you to
some new foster home...

611
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,145
probably make Mr. Morales' place
look like some pleasant dream to you.

612
00:44:51,716 --> 00:44:56,401
Unless, of course, you wanna play it
smart for the first time in your life.

613
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:59,425
How do I go about doin' that, Bob ?

614
00:44:59,432 --> 00:45:02,136
I got some money on me.
I got an A.T.M. card.

615
00:45:02,144 --> 00:45:05,890
We can go get some more.
You can go your way, I'll go mine.

616
00:45:05,897 --> 00:45:09,018
I swear to God,
you'll never see or hear me again.

617
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:12,042
What do you say ?

618
00:45:13,197 --> 00:45:16,213
I say, turn off
on that exit up there !

619
00:45:16,221 --> 00:45:18,403
Vanessa, we're in
the middle of nowhere !

620
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,218
You wanna get shot
a whole bunch of times ?

621
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:24,138
Now do like I tell you, dumbass !

622
00:45:24,145 --> 00:45:28,518
- Okay, I'm turning.
- You think this is a game ?

623
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:45,514
What are we gonna do, Vanessa ?
Drive around forever looking for a cop ?

624
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:49,164
Keep flappin' your gums, Bob.
Who cares if no one's listenin' ?

625
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:51,666
Pull up on that
dirt road over there.

626
00:46:09,921 --> 00:46:13,042
I know there's a lot of sick guys
that get hard...

627
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,232
thinkin' about messin' women up.

628
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,569
Hell, that's all
you ever see on TV.

629
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:22,740
But when a guy goes and does that for
real like you were plannin' on doin'...

630
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:27,015
- I was just trying to scare you.
- You had your turn to talk !

631
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:29,413
I think it's only fair to let me
get my two cents in.

632
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:32,333
You're absolutely right. Sorry.
Please, go on.

633
00:46:33,696 --> 00:46:37,025
But when a guy goes and hurts someone
who never hurt them,

634
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:40,571
that makes him a criminal first
and a sick guy second.

635
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:43,907
It's like being sick has to take
second place to being crooked.

636
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:46,514
And Bob, you're crooked.

637
00:46:46,522 --> 00:46:49,747
You proved that to me tonight.

638
00:46:49,754 --> 00:46:53,813
- Am I making any sense ?
- Yes. There's so much I wanna tell you...

639
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:57,672
- Bob.
- There's more to me than what you saw.

640
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,444
- Bob.
- Please.

641
00:46:59,556 --> 00:47:02,051
The time for talk's over now.

642
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:08,412
I'm gonna ask you a question
and it's real, real important, okay ?

643
00:47:08,419 --> 00:47:09,976
What ?

644
00:47:11,443 --> 00:47:14,772
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and personal Savior ?

645
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,796
Oh, my God ! Vanessa,
you're really scaring me.

646
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:20,820
Tell me now, Bob.
I need to know.

647
00:47:22,392 --> 00:47:26,034
Do you believe that Jesus Christ
is your Lord and personal Savior ?

648
00:47:26,771 --> 00:47:29,788
Yes. Yes, I do.
I swear.

649
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:32,916
Good. That's really good.

650
00:48:22,558 --> 00:48:25,053
Oh, God, not like this.

651
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:59,255
Oh, God.

652
00:48:59,262 --> 00:49:02,174
Dear God,
that was so fuckin' bad.

653
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:05,720
But I was at a loss,
so I left it up to You.

654
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:11,038
I love You with all my heart and I hope
You don't hate me more than You do.

655
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:16,043
Please bless Mama, Larry
and Chopper.

656
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,607
Amen.

657
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:24,759
<i>- Yeah, sure thing. Regular ?
- Yeah.</i>

658
00:50:24,766 --> 00:50:27,053
<i>Be right back.</i>

659
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,660
<i>My God ! Did you see...</i>

660
00:50:37,592 --> 00:50:39,566
<i>What the hell ?</i>

661
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:45,718
I think I'll have the
"Double He-Man Breakfast"...

662
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:49,368
and a large size cherry cola.

663
00:50:53,859 --> 00:50:55,311
What ?

664
00:50:58,134 --> 00:51:01,463
I must look a fright.
Got a washroom ?

665
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:19,398
<i>Dr. Barnes, 4721.</i>

666
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:27,010
<i>Dr. Kenseno to I.C.U.</i>

667
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,807
<i>Nurse Bowman to the Nursery.</i>

668
00:51:31,814 --> 00:51:33,892
One moment, please.

669
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:40,357
Please.

670
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,860
Call the police.

671
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,633
Help me.

672
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,675
Call...

673
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:49,012
my wife, please.

674
00:51:57,466 --> 00:51:59,961
- Freeze ! Police !
- Hi, Officer. What's up ?

675
00:51:59,968 --> 00:52:03,298
- Let's go ! Come on.
- Sir, I did nothin' wrong.

676
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:05,592
- Shut up.
- I did nothin' wrong !

677
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,573
We got a gun !
We got a gun.

678
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,075
- Big wow.
- Back inside, sir.

679
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:14,038
God, half the goddamn world's got a gun.
You're gonna throw me in this car...

680
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:15,602
Enough !

681
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:19,043
Give me a goddamn break.

682
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:23,005
What ? What, you're not even
goin' to speak to me, Mr. Oink Man ?

683
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:26,759
- I bet you like snatching girls.
- Back it up.

684
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:31,973
Mr. Wolverton.

685
00:52:33,544 --> 00:52:36,978
Mr. Wolverton's just learned he's going
to have to undergo a radical colectomy.

686
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:38,646
That's rough.

687
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:40,940
Yeah ? Jesus.

688
00:52:40,948 --> 00:52:45,111
There's detectives from the sheriff's
department who need to speak to you.

689
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,552
As soon as we finish
our neurologic test.

690
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,804
Mr. Wolverton ?

691
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:53,036
Mr. Wolverton ? Mr. Wolverton,
can you hear me ?

692
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:56,164
I'm Garnet Wallace
from the sheriff's department.

693
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:59,293
I know you're in a lot of pain,
but can you take a moment ?

694
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,402
I wanna show you a photograph. Tell me
if this is the person that shot you.

695
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:07,322
Is this the person that shot you ?

696
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:08,677
- Yes !
- Are you sure ?

697
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,014
This is the person that shot you ?

698
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:14,829
Okay. You'll be all right.

699
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:20,043
Oh, God ! Please !

700
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:23,901
Give me the fuckin' morphine !
Oh, please !

701
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,238
Mrs. Wolverton, your husband
gave a positive identification.

702
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,011
What happens now ?

703
00:53:29,018 --> 00:53:32,764
- Well, you have to keep in mind...
- Please !

704
00:53:32,772 --> 00:53:35,371
this is a juvenile
we're talking about.

705
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:39,125
- What ? You're gonna let her free ?
- I didn't say we're gonna let her free.

706
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,045
She can be incarcerated
up to the age of 25.

707
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,382
For that ? Look at him.
Ten years ?

708
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:49,344
My husband is in there with God knows
how many bullets in his head

709
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,221
and in his back.

710
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,870
She deliberately shot him
over and over again.

711
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:58,416
- I want her held responsible.
- Mrs. Wolverton.

712
00:53:58,423 --> 00:54:01,440
I assure you that whoever did this
isn't just gonna walk away.

713
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,691
What if he dies ?

714
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,819
If he dies, I think that she should
be put in the electric chair.

715
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:07,383
- Gas.
- What ?

716
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:10,094
We use gas in California.

717
00:54:10,102 --> 00:54:12,910
I think you know
what I mean, Detective.

718
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:16,872
I certainly hope that the people
who are prosecuting this case

719
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,522
can muster a little more sensitivity
for the rights of the victims...

720
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:23,754
- than you appear to have.
- I didn't mean to sound uncaring.

721
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:26,987
I want that little monster
to pay for this. For me.

722
00:54:26,994 --> 00:54:31,158
For my husband. For the next person
that she'll end up hurting or killing...

723
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:33,869
if, God forbid,
she's allowed back on the streets again.

724
00:54:48,162 --> 00:54:50,761
- Vanessa Lutz.
- Yes, sir ?

725
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:54,202
My name is Garnet Wallace,
and this is my partner Mike Breer.

726
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,288
We're with the
L.A. Sheriff's Department.

727
00:54:57,546 --> 00:54:59,937
You're that guy on TV,
aren't you ?

728
00:55:02,343 --> 00:55:05,464
Investigating the I-5 murders.

729
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:10,573
Y'all can take a fuckin' cruise, 'cause
I took care of that piece of shit.

730
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,223
Mr. Wolverton's in critical condition,
but he isn't dead.

731
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,664
Oh, yeah, right.
I shot him so many times.

732
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:23,503
Aren't you concerned about being tried
as an adult for murder ?

733
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:26,110
Vanessa, the reason that we're here

734
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:29,864
is to give you an opportunity
to change your story.

735
00:55:30,705 --> 00:55:34,243
That would make me
a big fat liar, wouldn't it ?

736
00:55:35,606 --> 00:55:38,623
Look, kid, cooperate

737
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,334
'cause right now,
we're the best friends you've got.

738
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:43,628
Yeah, I'm so sure.

739
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:47,695
- You don't believe we're your friends ?
- I believe you're out to ruin me.

740
00:55:47,702 --> 00:55:49,676
Look, I never said I wouldn't talk.

741
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:53,638
I might not happen to say
what y'all wanna hear.

742
00:55:53,646 --> 00:55:58,643
You want me to talk, that's fine,
but let me call me fiance right after.

743
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:05,838
Fine. No problem.
Now talk.

744
00:56:05,846 --> 00:56:07,924
What do you wanna know ?

745
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:11,782
Did Mr. Wolverton say
he was the I-5 Killer ?

746
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:14,076
He didn't say he wasn't.

747
00:56:15,126 --> 00:56:17,204
- I haven't said I'm the I-5 Killer.
- Yeah.

748
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:20,019
And you haven't said you're gonna
slash me dead with a razor,

749
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:22,418
and do sex to my dead body neither.

750
00:56:22,425 --> 00:56:24,503
Mr. Wolverton said that to you ?

751
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:27,527
Yeah, right after
he cut off all my hair.

752
00:56:27,534 --> 00:56:30,343
Then he called me
one of them "garbage people".

753
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:34,722
Then I asked him if he was that killer,
and he started smilin' all proud-like.

754
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:38,059
You have an opportunity now
to clear your conscience.

755
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:40,978
I told the truth...

756
00:56:40,986 --> 00:56:43,898
and truth is eternal.

757
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:45,879
Vanessa Lutz.

758
00:56:48,493 --> 00:56:52,866
You still haven't told us why you were
walking around with a loaded gun anyway ?

759
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:56,202
I was gonna sell it
to finance my trip.

760
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:01,312
Yet you ended up shooting some poor slob
who had the decency to give you a ride.

761
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:04,336
Yeah, except for the decency part.

762
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:08,194
When did you decide to rob him ?
Was it before or after you shot him ?

763
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:11,843
Look, that perv owed me for pain and
sufferin', so yeah, I took his money.

764
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:14,555
- Why didn't you turn him in ?
- I wanted to.

765
00:57:14,562 --> 00:57:17,161
But he kept sayin' it would be
his word against mine,

766
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:21,645
and that he'd get off
and I would go to foster care again.

767
00:57:21,652 --> 00:57:25,295
And aside from that, I knew if I let
him go, he would go kill another girl.

768
00:57:25,302 --> 00:57:27,797
And that would've been my fault.

769
00:57:27,805 --> 00:57:31,655
And I couldn't have lived
with that. Never.

770
00:57:31,663 --> 00:57:33,115
No way.

771
00:57:33,123 --> 00:57:36,765
Why were you so convinced
we wouldn't believe you ?

772
00:57:36,772 --> 00:57:39,893
'Cause I've been in the system,
and once you've been in it once,

773
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,291
ain't no one never gonna
believe you again.

774
00:57:42,299 --> 00:57:44,481
That's just how it goes.

775
00:57:44,488 --> 00:57:46,775
Tell us about your past
legal problems.

776
00:57:46,782 --> 00:57:48,756
It's all in my file.

777
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:51,259
I want to hear it from you.

778
00:57:56,793 --> 00:58:00,644
All right. When I was younger, I used
to have this problem with shoplifting.

779
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:03,146
And I got caught and...

780
00:58:03,153 --> 00:58:05,962
the judge sent me
to this group therapy session

781
00:58:05,969 --> 00:58:07,943
for these girls who are
supposed to be klepto.

782
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:10,550
How many times were you
arrested for shoplifting ?

783
00:58:12,017 --> 00:58:13,991
Seven times.

784
00:58:15,145 --> 00:58:17,223
What else ?

785
00:58:19,316 --> 00:58:24,209
Okay. Now this is gonna sound bad,
but it's not as bad as it seems.

786
00:58:25,572 --> 00:58:29,110
But I learned later that
I had this problem with anger.

787
00:58:29,118 --> 00:58:31,821
But I don't have that problem no more.

788
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:34,011
Just answer the question.

789
00:58:34,018 --> 00:58:39,642
Back in Texas, these cops said
that I lit this shed on fire.

790
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,249
You were arrested for arson ?

791
00:58:42,256 --> 00:58:45,064
Yeah, but nobody got hurt.
It was no big deal.

792
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,984
The judge even said I could
get it "explunged" from my record

793
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,591
if I was to go to
these group therapy sessions

794
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:54,344
with all them teenagers
who are supposed to be firebugs.

795
00:58:54,352 --> 00:58:56,117
But...

796
00:58:56,124 --> 00:59:00,392
that judge got switched,
so that's why it's still there.

797
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:03,833
How many times were you
arrested for arson ?

798
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:08,630
Three times.

799
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,133
Okay. What else ?

800
00:59:11,453 --> 00:59:14,886
Come on, Vanessa.
Tell us.

801
00:59:16,354 --> 00:59:18,223
Soliciting.

802
00:59:19,586 --> 00:59:21,664
Just doin' what came natural, huh ?

803
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:23,333
Hey, Mike.

804
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,816
What's that supposed to mean ?

805
00:59:27,824 --> 00:59:30,632
- Let's get back to the questions.
- No.

806
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,030
What's that supposed to mean ?

807
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:36,263
You think prostitution comes natural,
like bein' a nigger ?

808
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,035
You don't like
bein' called a nigger ?

809
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:41,476
Well, I don't like being called
a natural-born whore. So there.

810
00:59:41,483 --> 00:59:42,832
- Sit down.
- No !

811
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:45,230
He's talkin' to me
the way that fuckin' guy did !

812
00:59:45,237 --> 00:59:49,297
Is that why you shot him ? Or because
you wanted what was in his wallet ?

813
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:52,738
I already told you why I shot him,
you shit-skinned motherfucker.

814
00:59:56,707 --> 00:59:59,307
Fine, you fuckin' coon !

815
00:59:59,314 --> 01:00:02,435
I'll kick your black ass
all over this fuckin' station !

816
01:00:02,442 --> 01:00:04,208
Shithead.

817
01:00:04,945 --> 01:00:06,398
You okay, Mike ?

818
01:00:09,116 --> 01:00:12,758
- Why'd you call him those names ?
- 'Cause he didn't say he was sorry...

819
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:14,948
and I knew it would piss him off.

820
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:17,034
Now, how 'bout that phone call ?

821
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:20,057
Come on, come on.
I need another quarter.

822
01:00:20,065 --> 01:00:22,039
Come on !

823
01:00:25,696 --> 01:00:28,608
Hey, Mrs. Wood.
Is Chopper there ?

824
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,828
Holy shit !

825
01:01:01,983 --> 01:01:05,208
Look who got beat
with the ugly stick !

826
01:01:05,215 --> 01:01:07,189
Is that you, Bob ?

827
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,924
I can't believe such a little gun could
make such a big mess out of someone.

828
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:14,488
Are you out of your mind ?

829
01:01:16,268 --> 01:01:19,493
You are so ugly, Bob !

830
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:23,456
You know it's gonna cramp
your style big-time. You know that ?

831
01:01:23,463 --> 01:01:26,793
Especially with little Miss Priss
over there.

832
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,608
And, hey, I heard you have
one of them big poop bags.

833
01:01:29,615 --> 01:01:33,153
It's attached to your body
and all your shit lands in it.

834
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:36,490
You are a big old shit bag,
ain't you, Bob ?

835
01:01:36,497 --> 01:01:39,410
You think of me every time you empty
that fuckin' thing, motherfucker !

836
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:42,329
Quiet ! Stay there.

837
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:43,998
All right.

838
01:01:44,005 --> 01:01:47,126
One more word, young lady,
and you're going to be gagged.

839
01:01:52,034 --> 01:01:55,051
The People versus
Vanessa Julia Lutz.

840
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:57,449
Your Honor, due to
the heinous nature...

841
01:01:57,456 --> 01:02:00,682
of this crime and the defendant's
obvious lack of remorse,

842
01:02:00,689 --> 01:02:03,497
the State moves
that Vanessa Julia Lutz

843
01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:05,374
be tried as an adult.

844
01:02:05,381 --> 01:02:09,023
Your Honor, my client
is an illiterate child.

845
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:13,924
- One only has to look at her...
- I've had my look, counselor.

846
01:02:13,932 --> 01:02:16,427
And I've been listening too.

847
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:20,598
I'm going to direct Youth Authority to
prepare a report on the defendant's...

848
01:02:20,605 --> 01:02:24,143
suitability to be tried as an adult.

849
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,829
Hello there, ladies.

850
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:05,853
Welcome to Bridgewater.

851
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,919
I'm Mrs. Cullins,
and if you follow me,

852
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:13,777
I'll show you to your beds.

853
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:20,347
<i>Who am I, am I the type
to leave you where you're standing</i>

854
01:03:20,354 --> 01:03:22,745
<i>Damn right
so watch the way you're acting</i>

855
01:03:22,752 --> 01:03:25,039
<i>Put you under a microscope
and watch you from afar</i>

856
01:03:25,046 --> 01:03:27,333
<i>Rattle up your nerves
in every type of war</i>

857
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,565
<i>Staring out the window 'cause you're
paranoid thinkin' I'm gonna get ya</i>

858
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,859
<i>I got your mind
playin' tricks on you</i>

859
01:03:32,867 --> 01:03:35,153
Venus, this is yours, number eight.

860
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:37,135
And Vanessa...

861
01:03:37,142 --> 01:03:39,116
number 12.

862
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,704
Hello, Rhonda.

863
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:45,894
Hey, Mrs. Cullins.

864
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:49,752
Say hello to Vanessa.
Vanessa, this is Rhonda.

865
01:03:51,323 --> 01:03:53,401
How you doing ?

866
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:55,174
I was hoping

867
01:03:55,181 --> 01:03:58,719
that you could show Vanessa
around the craft shop later.

868
01:04:00,395 --> 01:04:02,473
I can't.

869
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,601
See, I'm on...
I'm on restriction.

870
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:10,398
Rhonda, what did you do
this time ?

871
01:04:10,405 --> 01:04:12,588
Mrs. Joiner said...

872
01:04:12,595 --> 01:04:18,114
that I was touching Wanda Z.
all inappropriate.

873
01:04:21,354 --> 01:04:23,119
Rhonda.

874
01:04:23,127 --> 01:04:25,205
I swear !

875
01:04:32,198 --> 01:04:36,571
So, who'd you kill ?

876
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:38,865
What makes you think
I killed somebody ?

877
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:42,410
'Cause they got you wearin'

878
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:45,330
one of them orange murder suits.

879
01:04:46,275 --> 01:04:49,188
Only the shooters wear
them things.

880
01:04:50,134 --> 01:04:52,525
Actually, I left him for dead...

881
01:04:52,532 --> 01:04:55,444
but he pulled through.

882
01:04:57,328 --> 01:05:01,388
I'm here for huffin' paint.

883
01:05:01,395 --> 01:05:04,307
They put you in here for that ?

884
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:06,497
Durin' the strip search...

885
01:05:07,652 --> 01:05:11,190
they found this gram of tar
in my cooch.

886
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:12,754
Do you like tar ?

887
01:05:13,908 --> 01:05:16,925
No. Heroin's way too gnarly for me.

888
01:05:18,392 --> 01:05:19,323
I don't get...

889
01:05:19,434 --> 01:05:21,825
how a person

890
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:26,101
could go through their whole lives
never being into girls.

891
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:31,836
I just... I love girls.

892
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:35,172
You can keep 'em.

893
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,675
You don't know what you're missing.

894
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,894
Chola alert.

895
01:05:51,342 --> 01:05:53,733
- How many ?
- Three.

896
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:57,383
But you only gotta worry
about one.

897
01:06:06,983 --> 01:06:09,061
Oye.

898
01:06:09,069 --> 01:06:10,834
Cockerbunny.

899
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:14,171
They got you to cheat school

900
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,361
or what ?

901
01:06:18,245 --> 01:06:20,219
Bitch.

902
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,826
I'm fuckin' talkin' to you, man.

903
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,333
My name is Vanessa Julia Lutz.

904
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,627
Say it ! Cunt !

905
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,870
415, inmates only, module 1700.

906
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:49,103
Say my name before
I break your goddamn neck !

907
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:50,667
Bitch !

908
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:57,027
Stick it in her.
Stick it in her !

909
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,634
Break it up !

910
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:02,658
Hey ! Let go of me !

911
01:07:02,665 --> 01:07:04,952
Get her to the infirmary !

912
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:07,559
- Oh, dear.
- Right in there.

913
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,460
This isn't going to hurt
a bit, sweetie.

914
01:07:12,467 --> 01:07:15,379
And afterwards, you can have
a nice little nap.

915
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:19,342
We can remove those
pesky restraints now.

916
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:23,930
Get off me !

917
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:51,875
Hi, honey.

918
01:07:51,883 --> 01:07:54,482
- Grandma ?
- Here I am.

919
01:07:54,489 --> 01:07:57,506
- Hi, honey.
- Grandma ?

920
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,327
Grandma ?

921
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:36,192
<i>Vanessa Julia Lutz.</i>

922
01:08:38,597 --> 01:08:41,927
<i>Inmate shows no remorse
for her crimes.</i>

923
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,557
<i>Inmate is combative.</i>

924
01:08:50,067 --> 01:08:54,231
<i>Refuses to accept responsibility
for her actions.</i>

925
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,316
<i>Recommendations :</i>

926
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:59,862
<i>This inmate appears to be
a sophisticated criminal...</i>

927
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,781
<i>and an extreme danger
to society,</i>

928
01:09:02,789 --> 01:09:06,327
<i>and should be required to pay
the penalty for her actions...</i>

929
01:09:06,334 --> 01:09:09,455
<i>in a facility for adult criminals.</i>

930
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,479
<i>Diagnosis :</i>

931
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:15,294
<i>antisocial personality disorder.</i>

932
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:18,422
<i>Prognosis :</i>

933
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,508
<i>very poor.</i>

934
01:09:21,454 --> 01:09:23,532
<i>Recommendations :</i>

935
01:09:26,459 --> 01:09:28,954
<i>Oh, this individual is probably
too far gone</i>

936
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:31,769
to benefit from corrective
behavior modification

937
01:09:31,777 --> 01:09:36,462
of the kind offered
in a setting for juveniles.

938
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:09,517
Hello, Vanessa.
Do you think you can join

939
01:10:09,524 --> 01:10:12,019
the rest of us now ?

940
01:10:12,026 --> 01:10:15,564
If nobody gives me
no more problems.

941
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,446
<i>We need to put an end to the system
that lets dangerous, violent thugs...</i>

942
01:10:22,454 --> 01:10:26,722
<i>be prosecuted as juveniles,
rather than as adults,</i>

943
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:29,746
<i>even when they have committed
the most vicious crimes.</i>

944
01:10:29,753 --> 01:10:32,874
<i>Hi, this is Janice Miller
of Inside View.</i>

945
01:10:32,881 --> 01:10:37,045
<i>We're here with Mr. Robert Wolverton
and his wife Mimi Wolverton...</i>

946
01:10:37,052 --> 01:10:39,443
<i>at their home in Orange County.</i>

947
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:42,676
<i>Would you describe some
of the hardships</i>

948
01:10:42,683 --> 01:10:46,117
<i>you've had to endure
since this ordeal began ?</i>

949
01:10:46,124 --> 01:10:48,828
<i>My husband's been
permanently disfigured.</i>

950
01:10:48,835 --> 01:10:51,226
<i>How can he work
with children again ?</i>

951
01:10:51,233 --> 01:10:55,188
<i>His appearance...
Well, it frightens them.</i>

952
01:10:55,196 --> 01:10:58,421
<i>He's unable to have
sexual relations.</i>

953
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:02,070
<i>You're saying your husband
is no longer capable...</i>

954
01:11:02,078 --> 01:11:03,426
<i>of achieving an erection ?</i>

955
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:05,407
<i>That part of our lives is over now.</i>

956
01:11:05,415 --> 01:11:07,493
<i>What makes me so angry</i>

957
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,351
<i>is how that little monster ridiculed us
during her preliminary hearing.</i>

958
01:11:11,358 --> 01:11:12,706
<i>And the media.</i>

959
01:11:12,714 --> 01:11:15,626
<i>How dare the media talk about
how horrible her life is.</i>

960
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:17,086
<i>What about us ?</i>

961
01:11:17,093 --> 01:11:21,153
<i>Psychopath. She's been locked up,
nine, ten times ?</i>

962
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,176
<i>Why was she ever let back out
on the streets again ?</i>

963
01:11:24,184 --> 01:11:27,826
<i>If the teenager who allegedly
shot your husband were here,</i>

964
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:29,703
<i>what would you say to her ?</i>

965
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:32,414
<i>Was it worth the $ 300
she stole from him ?</i>

966
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,917
<i>Are you bitter...</i>

967
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:36,898
<i>Mr. Wolverton ?</i>

968
01:11:36,905 --> 01:11:40,026
<i>Well, Janice...</i>

969
01:11:40,033 --> 01:11:43,050
<i>after all the wonderful letters</i>

970
01:11:43,057 --> 01:11:48,264
<i>that we received
from across the country...</i>

971
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:52,122
My neck may not function,
but I have not lost my smile.

972
01:11:52,129 --> 01:11:56,293
<i>No, I'm not a bitter man.</i>

973
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,630
<i>I know there's a lot of people
looking for some real-life heroes.</i>

974
01:11:59,637 --> 01:12:01,402
<i>I think I found a few.</i>

975
01:12:01,409 --> 01:12:05,260
<i>Their courage is a real inspiration.</i>

976
01:12:05,268 --> 01:12:07,763
<i>Stay tuned for an unusual story</i>

977
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:11,100
<i>about a couple of sweltering
polar bears in Texas.</i>

978
01:12:38,844 --> 01:12:40,818
Holy shit.

979
01:12:41,868 --> 01:12:44,050
It's okay.

980
01:12:51,252 --> 01:12:55,624
Want me to go get you
some party punch ?

981
01:12:58,447 --> 01:13:00,838
No, I ain't thirsty.

982
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:08,867
You're all wigged out, huh ?

983
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:13,872
I get all these bad nightmares
once I get out of isolation.

984
01:13:15,235 --> 01:13:16,166
God...

985
01:13:18,572 --> 01:13:21,380
I am so happy to get out.

986
01:13:21,387 --> 01:13:23,466
I mean, I can't...

987
01:13:23,473 --> 01:13:26,281
I can't even sleep at all...

988
01:13:26,288 --> 01:13:29,201
let alone have nightmares.

989
01:13:31,398 --> 01:13:34,206
For me, it's like I get
all shrunk down.

990
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:38,168
I don't get what you mean.

991
01:13:39,784 --> 01:13:43,903
It's like I get like a cat
or a dog or somethin'.

992
01:13:45,162 --> 01:13:48,387
You can tell I'm just like
they all are.

993
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:53,288
If I get in the hole much longer,
I'm gonna be like this hermit...

994
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:56,416
shunning all human contact.

995
01:13:56,423 --> 01:13:58,502
Scared-like.

996
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:04,758
It's like that song says,
Vanessa.

997
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:07,782
People need people.

998
01:14:12,273 --> 01:14:15,394
I ain't so sure about that,
Rhonda.

999
01:14:18,425 --> 01:14:21,859
What is it that you think
that you need ?

1000
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:28,324
I'll tell you.
Back in the hole, I decided

1001
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:31,348
all I need to live was my will...

1002
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:39,168
and a knife's good too,

1003
01:14:39,176 --> 01:14:42,505
so you don't feel
so at the mercy of events.

1004
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:49,596
- Wow. You made this ?
- Yeah.

1005
01:14:49,603 --> 01:14:52,307
My stepfather Larry showed me how.

1006
01:14:52,314 --> 01:14:54,288
It's pretty cool, huh ?

1007
01:14:58,362 --> 01:15:01,170
What are you gonna do with it ?

1008
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:03,255
Get the hell outta here.

1009
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:07,218
You might have to mess up
some of the staff.

1010
01:15:07,225 --> 01:15:10,659
You really feel sorry
for them people ?

1011
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:14,413
Think normal people wake up one day and
decide they're going to work in prison ?

1012
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,768
They're perverts...

1013
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,958
every last one of them.

1014
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,338
Any of them fuckos get in my way,
I'm gonna make them wish they hadn't.

1015
01:15:29,644 --> 01:15:32,348
Do you like that ?

1016
01:15:35,275 --> 01:15:37,353
I'll make out with you...

1017
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,813
but no fucking.

1018
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,064
I'm straight.

1019
01:15:47,162 --> 01:15:49,136
Okay, you two.

1020
01:15:49,873 --> 01:15:52,994
Your Honor, it's obvious
my client is an unstable child.

1021
01:15:53,001 --> 01:15:55,705
It says here : "Nearly illiterate,
emotionally immature,

1022
01:15:55,712 --> 01:15:57,999
prone to impulsivity,
unpredictable..."

1023
01:15:58,006 --> 01:16:00,397
Your Honor, she is charged
with a gruesome crime.

1024
01:16:00,405 --> 01:16:01,753
Counselor, please.

1025
01:16:01,865 --> 01:16:03,838
It goes on to say
she should be tried as an adult.

1026
01:16:03,846 --> 01:16:06,132
She will be tried as an adult.

1027
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,801
Thank you, Your Honor.

1028
01:16:07,808 --> 01:16:12,180
Jury selection will commence
on June 8 at 10:00 a.m.

1029
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:15,621
Are we leaving ?

1030
01:16:17,193 --> 01:16:20,314
What are y'all lookin' at ?
Fuck all y'all.

1031
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:24,693
Fuck you, chipmunk face,
and your fuckin' skipper wife.

1032
01:16:28,976 --> 01:16:33,661
I see here that you and Vanessa were
arrested together twice in two years.

1033
01:16:33,668 --> 01:16:35,329
Yeah.

1034
01:16:35,336 --> 01:16:38,145
We needed money. We thought
it would be grown-up turning tricks

1035
01:16:38,152 --> 01:16:40,647
on Warren Avenue
outside the Snack-N-Shop.

1036
01:16:40,654 --> 01:16:44,401
Except we got pinched
in five minutes. Bitch.

1037
01:16:44,408 --> 01:16:47,633
You two were engaged in acts
of prostitution in the sixth grade ?

1038
01:16:47,641 --> 01:16:50,553
We were only gonna
jack 'em off is all.

1039
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,098
Did you ever see Vanessa

1040
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:57,644
act in an overtly hostile way
to an actual human being ?

1041
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:02,336
You mean like blow somebody's
brains out all over the place ?

1042
01:17:02,343 --> 01:17:04,943
- You think that's funny ?
- Yeah.

1043
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:08,905
What about her boyfriend
who passed away ?

1044
01:17:11,102 --> 01:17:13,285
It was pretty exclusive.

1045
01:17:15,795 --> 01:17:18,498
Okay, Cherry, that'll be all for now.
Thank you.

1046
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,998
I know she's blowing it
over him.

1047
01:17:46,868 --> 01:17:48,946
Well, what do you know ?

1048
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:57,705
- She's a coal-burner.
- What's a coal-burner ?

1049
01:17:57,713 --> 01:18:00,625
It means her boyfriend's black.

1050
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:02,502
Are you surprised ?

1051
01:18:02,509 --> 01:18:04,483
- Aren't you ?
- You know, Mike...

1052
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:07,611
every kid we've spoken to
about this Lutz girl...

1053
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:10,218
seems to hold her
in very high regard.

1054
01:18:10,225 --> 01:18:14,598
Look at her friends. They're
the most fucked-up kids I've ever seen.

1055
01:18:14,605 --> 01:18:17,309
- Still, something just doesn't...
- What ?

1056
01:18:18,776 --> 01:18:22,001
- I gotta go back to the crime scene.
- It's two-and-a-half hours away.

1057
01:18:22,008 --> 01:18:22,940
Wallace !

1058
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,381
Go. Get it out of your system.

1059
01:19:07,472 --> 01:19:09,237
Go on.

1060
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:14,868
Diamonds on the back, ladies.
Diamonds on the back.

1061
01:19:16,022 --> 01:19:19,247
I'm going to get some jerky.
Stay in line !

1062
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:34,263
Don't forget to wash
your hands now, ladies.

1063
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:40,311
Do you think that
little guard's cute ?

1064
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:43,647
I guess.
Yeah, sort of punky.

1065
01:19:45,844 --> 01:19:49,174
Better watch out 'cause it's gonna
get crazy in here in a second.

1066
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:51,989
You gonna cut up that cute guard ?

1067
01:19:51,997 --> 01:19:56,577
- If he gets in my way, I will.
- Well, you're stupid...

1068
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:01,165
if you think you can
get past both them.

1069
01:20:01,173 --> 01:20:04,085
What the fuck do you care
what happens to me ?

1070
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:09,612
I'm here on double murder, okay ?
In two years, I'm gonna be 18.

1071
01:20:09,619 --> 01:20:13,365
I'm going to be sent to Frontera for
20 years, so why shouldn't I help ?

1072
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:16,181
Because two heads

1073
01:20:17,231 --> 01:20:20,143
are a lot fuckin' better
than one head.

1074
01:20:24,634 --> 01:20:27,234
Hurry up in there, ladies.

1075
01:20:30,474 --> 01:20:32,865
<i>- Come on, now.
- All right.</i>

1076
01:20:39,128 --> 01:20:42,562
- Don't you fuckin' breathe !
- Vanessa.

1077
01:20:42,569 --> 01:20:45,482
- I'm dead serious. What did I say ?
- Where did the hack go ?

1078
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:48,089
He-he went to get...

1079
01:20:48,096 --> 01:20:50,904
a beef treat, Mesquita.

1080
01:20:50,911 --> 01:20:52,885
- And he'll be right back.
- Shut up.

1081
01:20:52,892 --> 01:20:55,596
- You can't get by the both of us.
- Shut up !

1082
01:20:55,604 --> 01:20:58,307
- Think about it...
- Shut up !

1083
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:17,702
- My sister Brenda thinks you're cute.
- I do not.

1084
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:20,935
- You do too.
- Where's Mrs. Cullins ?

1085
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,229
I don't know.

1086
01:21:27,094 --> 01:21:29,589
Who told you you could fight ?

1087
01:21:30,744 --> 01:21:33,239
- You didn't have to kill me.
- What ?

1088
01:21:33,246 --> 01:21:37,306
- You didn't have to kill me !
- I didn't, you dirty little pervert.

1089
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:41,060
Gimme your goddamn car keys
before I cut your pecker off.

1090
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:44,188
That won't feel very good,
will it ?

1091
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:46,586
- He sure is bloody.
- I still think he's cute.

1092
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:52,634
Move the fuckin' leg, man !

1093
01:21:54,101 --> 01:21:57,118
- Move your fuckin' face !
- Mesquita, I'd really like to go now.

1094
01:22:12,662 --> 01:22:15,053
Good night, everybody !

1095
01:22:22,255 --> 01:22:25,167
My homeys are here, Vanessa.

1096
01:22:31,535 --> 01:22:33,822
I missed you so much.

1097
01:22:33,829 --> 01:22:36,220
You smell the same.

1098
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:42,685
- What happened ?
- I was playing with ketchup.

1099
01:22:42,693 --> 01:22:46,022
This is...
my little bunkie Vanessa.

1100
01:22:49,053 --> 01:22:50,819
<i>Quiere un carro. Okay ?</i>

1101
01:22:50,826 --> 01:22:54,155
<i>And don't you worry, Cacahuete.
Everything will be all right.</i>

1102
01:22:54,163 --> 01:22:55,928
All right.

1103
01:23:02,609 --> 01:23:05,208
- You look pretty.
- Thanks.

1104
01:23:06,571 --> 01:23:10,109
So... you won't think
I sound all feminist and shit.

1105
01:23:10,117 --> 01:23:12,195
It's like...

1106
01:23:12,202 --> 01:23:16,678
the one thing that I learned
in jail is that...

1107
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:20,745
girls gotta help out
other girls, you know ?

1108
01:23:21,899 --> 01:23:24,916
Especially convict girls 'cause...

1109
01:23:24,923 --> 01:23:28,566
if they don't,
they oughta be fucking dead.

1110
01:23:28,573 --> 01:23:31,798
- Know what I mean ?
- I hear what you're sayin'.

1111
01:23:38,688 --> 01:23:40,766
Need me to drop that off
anywhere ?

1112
01:23:40,773 --> 01:23:43,790
No. The owner, he won't mind.

1113
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:49,420
Badass.

1114
01:23:52,452 --> 01:23:54,634
You're going to need this, girl.

1115
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:56,824
Oh, Mesquita, you already done
too much for me.

1116
01:23:56,831 --> 01:24:02,142
This ain't even $20. This bomb's
a total gas hog. Don't be stupid.

1117
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:04,749
You know what I really need
is a gun.

1118
01:24:13,619 --> 01:24:15,593
<i>You gonna give her my juguete.</i>

1119
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,887
<i>I'll get you another one, pendejo.</i>

1120
01:24:17,894 --> 01:24:21,015
I'll get you a cellular too
and a beeper.

1121
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:23,101
I'll get ahold of your ass.

1122
01:24:23,108 --> 01:24:25,186
Watch out for the pigs, Vanessa.

1123
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:28,106
Yeah, I'm sorry
for busting your nose that time.

1124
01:24:28,113 --> 01:24:30,191
I was just real upset that day.

1125
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:33,632
Oh, that hurt.
I'm all trying to work it...

1126
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,552
so I can get you to put out
with me later on.

1127
01:24:36,559 --> 01:24:39,576
I guess I went about it
pretty dumb, huh ?

1128
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:42,913
Mesquita, I'd put out for you
any day of the week.

1129
01:24:43,754 --> 01:24:46,667
I only do that in lockup.

1130
01:24:46,987 --> 01:24:48,648
Come here.

1131
01:24:59,812 --> 01:25:02,725
Good morning, Mrs. Wolverton.

1132
01:25:03,775 --> 01:25:07,000
- Have you found her ?
- No, we haven't.

1133
01:25:07,007 --> 01:25:10,441
- I don't think you're in any danger.
- Oh, really.

1134
01:25:10,448 --> 01:25:13,986
Well, your life hasn't been ruined
by this little monster, has it ?

1135
01:25:13,994 --> 01:25:16,385
Is your husband here now ?

1136
01:25:16,392 --> 01:25:18,887
No. He's at St. John's
doing his physical therapy.

1137
01:25:18,895 --> 01:25:21,286
Now what the hell
are you doing here ?

1138
01:25:21,293 --> 01:25:24,309
Go over to the hospital and escort
Mr. Wolverton back here, please.

1139
01:25:24,317 --> 01:25:26,186
Why ?

1140
01:25:28,279 --> 01:25:31,504
Mrs. Wolverton,
I have a search warrant here.

1141
01:25:31,512 --> 01:25:34,737
- What ?
- If you would just sign anywhere.

1142
01:25:34,744 --> 01:25:37,344
I'm not signing anything.

1143
01:25:39,019 --> 01:25:43,079
Steve, make note that Mrs. Wolverton
refused to sign the search warrant.

1144
01:25:43,086 --> 01:25:45,477
- I don't believe this.
- So noted.

1145
01:25:45,484 --> 01:25:47,771
Take care of downstairs.

1146
01:25:47,778 --> 01:25:52,463
And make sure you check out
the garage, backyard, everything.

1147
01:25:52,471 --> 01:25:54,862
What's this all about ?

1148
01:25:54,869 --> 01:25:57,677
Mrs. Wolverton, certain evidence
has come to light,

1149
01:25:57,684 --> 01:25:59,658
which we are duty bound
to investigate.

1150
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:02,995
- What sort of evidence ?
- I would prefer to discuss it...

1151
01:26:03,002 --> 01:26:06,332
in the presence of your husband,
if you don't mind.

1152
01:26:07,173 --> 01:26:08,939
There's a...

1153
01:26:08,946 --> 01:26:12,275
There's a storage shed out back.
I'm going to take a look.

1154
01:26:12,804 --> 01:26:15,404
You wouldn't happen
to have the key, would you ?

1155
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:18,532
- Fuck you.
- Didn't think so.

1156
01:26:36,578 --> 01:26:39,699
Robert Wolverton. Correct.

1157
01:26:39,707 --> 01:26:41,368
Age 32.

1158
01:26:42,522 --> 01:26:45,017
Yeah, forensics is on its way.

1159
01:26:45,025 --> 01:26:49,293
Tony found some remains.
Human, animal... Who knows ?

1160
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:50,961
Mrs. Wolverton...

1161
01:26:50,968 --> 01:26:54,193
were you aware
your husband had mental problems ?

1162
01:26:54,201 --> 01:26:55,653
Those...

1163
01:26:57,016 --> 01:26:58,990
Those were...

1164
01:26:58,997 --> 01:27:00,971
Those were child...

1165
01:27:00,978 --> 01:27:02,744
Children ?

1166
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:04,204
Yes.

1167
01:27:04,837 --> 01:27:08,687
Just like the Lutz girl we've been dying
to see get strapped in the gas chamber.

1168
01:27:13,178 --> 01:27:15,569
- Will you ease up on her ?
- Fuck her !

1169
01:27:35,076 --> 01:27:36,633
Jesus.

1170
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:03,952
<i>Por favor.</i>

1171
01:28:04,794 --> 01:28:06,455
<i>Gracias.</i>

1172
01:28:08,235 --> 01:28:12,294
<i>Hey, ladies !
Donde estan los chicos?</i>

1173
01:28:18,871 --> 01:28:20,532
<i>Sexo!</i>

1174
01:28:20,539 --> 01:28:22,617
<i>Sexo!</i>

1175
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:24,807
<i>Yeah, muy bueno.</i>

1176
01:28:27,317 --> 01:28:29,812
Want to score, baby ?
Come on.

1177
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:35,026
Fuck you too.

1178
01:28:39,621 --> 01:28:42,221
Hey, babe.
Ooh, me so horny.

1179
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:45,662
Yeah, what about now ?

1180
01:28:46,712 --> 01:28:48,790
Fuck you too.

1181
01:28:49,632 --> 01:28:51,084
Back again, huh ?

1182
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:52,648
Want to fuck ?

1183
01:28:52,656 --> 01:28:54,212
How much ?

1184
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:02,033
Depends on what you're into.

1185
01:29:02,144 --> 01:29:04,014
Do you suck cock ?

1186
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:09,645
Sure. I can do that.

1187
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:13,086
I just wanna get sucked.

1188
01:29:13,093 --> 01:29:16,840
All right. Find us an alley and I'll
take care of you where you're sitting.

1189
01:29:16,847 --> 01:29:19,030
I'll pay $25.

1190
01:29:19,037 --> 01:29:22,366
I can live with that. Let's go.

1191
01:29:30,507 --> 01:29:33,211
- You're underage, aren't you ?
- Is that a problem ?

1192
01:29:33,218 --> 01:29:34,775
No.

1193
01:29:34,782 --> 01:29:36,965
Young people gotta live too.

1194
01:29:36,972 --> 01:29:40,197
Sure got that right.
Now get 'em all down, okay ?

1195
01:29:40,204 --> 01:29:42,804
Makes it a whole lot easier that way.

1196
01:29:51,049 --> 01:29:53,961
And gimme all your money !
All of it !

1197
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:55,421
Goddamn it !

1198
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:00,218
Jesus ! Okay !
Hey, I'm sorry, okay ?

1199
01:30:00,225 --> 01:30:03,867
- I was aimin' at your head, mister !
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1200
01:30:03,874 --> 01:30:06,891
If you get this over quick,
we'll both be a lot happier.

1201
01:30:06,898 --> 01:30:09,915
My money's in my briefcase
in the backseat.

1202
01:30:09,922 --> 01:30:11,166
Don't move it !

1203
01:30:11,174 --> 01:30:14,920
Just lean over and open it up
where it's laying.

1204
01:30:14,927 --> 01:30:17,423
And keep your pants where
they are, Mr. Dirty Mouth !

1205
01:30:21,601 --> 01:30:25,348
Don't swing that motherfuckin' thing
at me, or I swear to God you're dead !

1206
01:30:25,355 --> 01:30:26,599
Believe me ?

1207
01:30:26,606 --> 01:30:28,684
Why are you doing this ?

1208
01:30:28,692 --> 01:30:32,647
Because I'm pissed off and the whole
world owes me. Now gimme your money !

1209
01:30:42,664 --> 01:30:43,908
Where's the rest of it ?

1210
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,098
That's all I got.

1211
01:30:46,105 --> 01:30:48,913
You was just gonna give me
five dollars !

1212
01:30:48,921 --> 01:30:52,250
Please, please.
Just take it, okay ? Please ?

1213
01:30:52,257 --> 01:30:55,795
Get out of the goddamn car
right now, you little pecker snot !

1214
01:30:55,803 --> 01:30:57,047
Right now !

1215
01:30:58,201 --> 01:30:59,654
No !

1216
01:30:59,661 --> 01:31:03,303
Get all them panties off
before I get really pissed !

1217
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,578
You think I'm kiddin' ?

1218
01:31:09,254 --> 01:31:11,854
Now get your ass in the trunk.

1219
01:31:13,425 --> 01:31:14,773
Please...

1220
01:31:16,032 --> 01:31:17,172
I'm claustrophobic.

1221
01:31:17,179 --> 01:31:21,134
Well, I get claustrophobic
suckin' strange dick. Get in there !

1222
01:31:21,141 --> 01:31:23,115
Please, I gotta pee.

1223
01:31:23,122 --> 01:31:26,869
Well, pee in there, motherfucker !
I ain't kiddin' !

1224
01:31:26,876 --> 01:31:28,537
Now !

1225
01:31:28,545 --> 01:31:30,206
Dumbass.

1226
01:31:33,758 --> 01:31:37,296
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a no-smoking restaurant.

1227
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:55,127
You really are a dear, Flo.

1228
01:31:58,784 --> 01:32:01,696
Would you care for a warm-up ?

1229
01:32:01,704 --> 01:32:05,137
No, thank you.
I'd like to order.

1230
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:08,579
What would you like ?

1231
01:32:08,586 --> 01:32:10,664
Some chicken soup,

1232
01:32:10,671 --> 01:32:13,375
with a fucking straw.

1233
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:47,160
<i>Let me out !
I'm dying in here !</i>

1234
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:49,454
Oh, you are ?
Well, do it now.

1235
01:32:50,504 --> 01:32:53,729
Will you slow down, for Christ's sake ?
You're gonna get us killed.

1236
01:32:55,509 --> 01:32:57,483
There... There's the exit.

1237
01:33:08,543 --> 01:33:10,309
Grandma !

1238
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,228
Grandma !

1239
01:33:14,591 --> 01:33:16,148
Grandma !

1240
01:33:20,952 --> 01:33:22,196
Grandma !

1241
01:34:16,634 --> 01:34:19,963
<i>Let me out.
I'm dying in here.</i>

1242
01:34:24,142 --> 01:34:26,533
Grandma, it's me !

1243
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:29,139
It's me, Vanessa !

1244
01:34:29,147 --> 01:34:31,121
Hey, Grandma.

1245
01:34:31,128 --> 01:34:33,102
It's me, Vanessa.

1246
01:34:34,569 --> 01:34:36,543
Hi, Grandma.

1247
01:34:37,176 --> 01:34:39,463
Grandma, wake up.

1248
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:41,131
It's time to wake up.

1249
01:34:41,138 --> 01:34:45,719
I'm your granddaughter. I'm here
to take care of you forever and ever.

1250
01:34:45,726 --> 01:34:47,596
Why are you hiding ?

1251
01:34:48,959 --> 01:34:51,245
Here, let me see.

1252
01:34:54,694 --> 01:34:57,815
Them's some big ugly
fuckin' teeth you got, Bob.

1253
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:03,550
How do you like that,
Vanessa ?

1254
01:35:03,557 --> 01:35:05,635
You like how that fucking feels ?

1255
01:35:05,642 --> 01:35:09,181
- What did you do with my grandma ?
- Do you want to see your grandma ?

1256
01:35:11,482 --> 01:35:13,664
What do you think of grandma, kid ?

1257
01:35:13,672 --> 01:35:15,958
You fucker !

1258
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:19,816
- You killed my grandma !
- That's not all I did to grandma.

1259
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:23,779
Naomi.

1260
01:35:23,786 --> 01:35:26,594
Naomi, listen. I brought you
an extension cord...

1261
01:35:32,337 --> 01:35:35,666
Die, you piece of dick ! Dead !

1262
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:40,984
Die, you fucker !

1263
01:35:45,684 --> 01:35:46,719
Back inside !

1264
01:35:46,726 --> 01:35:48,387
My God !

1265
01:35:53,087 --> 01:35:55,582
Die, you piece of shit !

1266
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:57,251
Goddamn pig !

1267
01:35:58,196 --> 01:36:00,275
Let's go !

1268
01:36:08,102 --> 01:36:10,598
Fuckin' perv !

1269
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:14,664
Piece of shit !

1270
01:36:23,222 --> 01:36:24,883
Die !

1271
01:36:38,342 --> 01:36:40,316
Come on.

1272
01:36:41,574 --> 01:36:43,444
Oh, shit.

1273
01:36:43,451 --> 01:36:46,781
Get out of there.
Get out of there !

1274
01:37:06,496 --> 01:37:08,365
Holy shit.

1275
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:13,162
Holy shit.

1276
01:37:16,506 --> 01:37:17,541
Holy shit.

1277
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,182
You got a cigarette ?
