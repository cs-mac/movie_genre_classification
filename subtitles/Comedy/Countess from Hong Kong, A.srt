1
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:16,266
- What's the charge, sister?
- Half a dollar a dance.

2
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,560
- You mean them women are countesses?
- Some are.

3
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:26,193
Thank you, sir.

4
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:32,449
- I got a ticket to dance with a countess.
- Go to it, buddy.

5
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:36,453
Want to tell the folks back home
I'm movin' in high society.

6
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,248
- Oh, pardon me. Can I sit down?
- Please.

7
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:44,544
I've got a ticket to dance.
You a countess?

8
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:48,965
No kiddin'!

9
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,802
Tell me, how many countesses
are there around here?

10
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:55,430
Oh, quite a few.

11
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:29,106
Every statesman, every minister
and diplomat should dedicate himself...

12
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,984
to the cause of world peace.

13
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:35,946
Ogden, it's Harvey!
Ogden, are you still at that speech?

14
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,617
Here we are, China, Hong Kong,
and you're still trying to save the world.

15
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,870
Let's get out of here. See the town.
We're only staying 24 hours.

16
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:47,917
Okay, sir.

17
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,505
Can ya believe it? Hong Kong.
By golly, I can see a Chinaman.

18
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:54,548
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

19
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:58,594
Look at them.
Packed together like sardines.

20
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:01,639
That's what I dislike about
the poor. They have no taste.

21
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:05,100
They indulge in squalor. They pick
the worst neighbourhoods to live in...

22
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:08,354
eat the worst kind of food
and dress atrociously.

23
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,902
That wasn't a smile.
That was a gas pain.

24
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:17,446
How do you feel, buddy?

25
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,949
- Depressed. - You should be the
happiest man in the world.

26
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:25,746
Six weeks you'll be divorced,
and possibly the next Secretary of State.

27
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,582
- We'll wait and see.
- Here's the day's paper.

28
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:33,003
"Ogden Mears, multimillionaire,
son of the richest oilman in the world...

29
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:36,381
will be the new
Secretary of State."

30
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:38,926
Let me see that.

31
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:47,309
"Son of the richest oilman in the world."
They won't let you forget it.

32
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:50,645
That's the burden you must carry.

33
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,316
Harvey, you're a corrupting influence.

34
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,986
Maybe, but I didn't lead you
into politics.

35
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,238
- What else is there to do?
- Murder, arson, rape.

36
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:02,657
There's plenty of worthy occupations.

37
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:06,536
- Crawford, sir.
- Come in, Crawford.

38
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,332
Just came over the wire. The President
has appointed Mr Patrick Dowling...

39
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:14,920
- Secretary of State.
- Dowling, huh? Well, that's show business.

40
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:18,632
- Who the devil is Patrick Dowling?
- Secretary of State.

41
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:22,594
- I'll check for more news.
- Thank you, Crawford.

42
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:26,639
Harvey, I guess you're right. I think
I'll give up trying to save the world.

43
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:30,268
Tonight we're gonna celebrate
Patrick Dowling's appointment.

44
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:35,148
Excuse me, sir.
Mr Clark has telephoned.

45
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,983
Mr Clark? Where is he?

46
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,360
Up in the lounge.
He says he's on his way down.

47
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:42,113
- Show him here.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:47,327
- Who's Clark?
- He's one of Father's senior directors.

49
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,329
A venerable old gentleman.

50
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:52,040
We don't want to get stuck with that
old boy for the rest of the evening.

51
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:54,083
No, I'll get rid of him.

52
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:57,712
Remember you just got over the flu. Took
a long sea voyage to get away from it all.

53
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:02,425
- We don't want to be visiting
parks and museums. - Mr Clark, sir.

54
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:06,721
Ogden, my dear boy, I haven't seen you
since you were in swaddling clothes.

55
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,807
I must say you're
the replica of your father.

56
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:13,895
Uh, Mr Clark, may I present
my friend Harvey Crothers?

57
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:17,273
How do you do? I beg
your pardon. Well, sir.

58
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:20,568
Hudson tells me you're under the weather
and here I am ready to show you the town.

59
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:27,533
I think perhaps I better stay
inside and just take things easy.

60
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:31,579
Of course, my dear boy.
I'll not disturb you.

61
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:34,373
But before I go, I'd like to introduce
some very dear friends of mine.

62
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:36,375
They're waiting in the lounge.

63
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:41,339
Well, certainly. Hudson, would you show
Mr Clark's friends in?

64
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:44,967
- They're alone in the lounge.
You can't miss them. - Yes, sir.

65
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,970
Well, Ogden, too bad
you're not up to scratch.

66
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,389
I was looking forward
to showing you around.

67
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:54,101
Yes, well, I'm disappointed. I was
reading about it and it sounds fascinating.

68
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:58,689
- The botanical gardens and museums...
- Oh, dear me, dear me.

69
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:03,152
Botanical gardens? Ha, ha, ha!
I think we can do better than that.

70
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,500
I guess I've been
reading the wrong book.

71
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,003
Ogden, these are my friends.

72
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:24,339
This is Mr Ogden Mears...

73
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,009
Mr Harvey Crothers.

74
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,845
Countess Chiedoff...

75
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:33,432
Countess Natascha Alexandrov...

76
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:36,476
Baroness Cavanotchy.

77
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,687
Hello, I'd like a drink.

78
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,273
No, no, Baroness.
It's too early.

79
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,275
Excuse me.
What will you have, ladies?

80
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:46,153
- Champagne.
- Champagne, champagne.

81
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:53,994
No, no, don't turn it off.

82
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:56,705
Music complements
the champagne.

83
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:15,015
Too bad you're just
getting over the flu, Ogden.

84
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:18,977
I thought we might go on somewhere
this evening and take the ladies along.

85
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,605
But then the night air
might be dangerous for you.

86
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:25,692
Oh, I think if I wrap up well
it'll be all right.

87
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,291
Where are the girls?

88
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:44,544
I don't know. I think they went to the
ladies room as soon as you left.

89
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:47,338
I must have inspired them
with the same idea.

90
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:51,384
Let me tell you about
these ladies. Harvey.

91
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,554
They are the daughters
of Russian aristocrats.

92
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,223
Their titles are absolutely genuine.

93
00:08:57,307 --> 00:09:00,476
Their parents escaped to Shanghai
during the Russian Revolution.

94
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,564
Shanghai was a nasty place
in those days.

95
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:08,776
An international settlement
run by seven nations.

96
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,071
Because they had no country,
their life was worthless.

97
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:16,409
They could be robbed, murdered.
Nobody bothered.

98
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:19,787
Countess Natascha,
the one sitting next to you...

99
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,373
has had rather a sad life.

100
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,585
She was the mistress
of a gangster at the age of 14.

101
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:28,713
How did the others
manage to live?

102
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:32,341
Many starved,
others committed suicide.

103
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,094
Some of the women
worked in dance halls.

104
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:37,013
The men had to compete with the cheapest

105
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,307
labour because they
couldn't leave the country.

106
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:46,814
I think Harvey
is very good-looking.

107
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:49,442
A lot of good that'll do you.
He's penniless.

108
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:52,403
So what? Haven't you
any romance in your soul?

109
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:54,989
Money makes me romantic.

110
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:57,283
I thought Harvey
was the one with the dough.

111
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:02,454
You have poor instincts, my dear. It's the
other one, Ogden Mears, who has the money.

112
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:07,293
He's the son of the richest oilman in
the world, and Natascha's got him hooked.

113
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:10,170
Mr Ogden?
He's very attractive.

114
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:18,012
Only in her case,
she's found oil.

115
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:21,348
Well, you can have
your big oilman.

116
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:23,559
He's here today
and gone tomorrow.

117
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:25,936
But I shall stick to old Papa Clark.

118
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,648
He took me away
from the dance halls.

119
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:48,166
Listen, Milton...
Pardon me, Mr Milton Clark.

120
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,961
Would you like to dance?

121
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:53,130
Natascha.

122
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,646
You're very quiet this evening.

123
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,983
Am I? I'm sorry.

124
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:15,527
Don't apologize.
I like quiet people.

125
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,822
They're either clever or dull.

126
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:21,491
I would say you're
one of the clever ones.

127
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:25,203
Thank you.
I'd better keep silent.

128
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:28,915
Well, whatever you do,
it's very attractive.

129
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:34,170
- Would you like to dance? - No. I'd
like to sit here and talk with you.

130
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:37,424
- I regret I speak English so badly.
- You speak it beautifully.

131
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,928
I understand
you were born in Shanghai.

132
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:45,390
Yes. But my parents
came from Russia.

133
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:47,517
And now they've moved
to Hong Kong?

134
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,603
My parents died in Shanghai
when I was 13.

135
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:55,400
- Haven't you any brothers or sisters?
- I was an only child.

136
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:59,612
Thirteen, a little young
to face the world.

137
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:02,699
We must all face it
sooner or later.

138
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:05,368
Some more sooner.

139
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:08,079
How did you come
to live in Hong Kong?

140
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:13,126
Well, there was another war,
another revolution. So here we are.

141
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:18,256
- But let us talk of something
more cheerful. - I'm sorry.

142
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,883
- Would you like to dance?
- I'd love to.

143
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:47,910
Congratulations, Your Excellency. You
are now a Plenipotentiary Extraordinary.

144
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:51,580
Will you ring for the steward
and have him bring some ice water?

145
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:53,999
Oh.

146
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:59,338
What's this
Plenni-pli-plen-what?

147
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:01,632
Just came over the radio.
You've been appointed...

148
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:05,344
Plenipotentiary Extraordinary
to the Court of Saudi Arabia.

149
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:07,346
I'll never get away
from the oil business.

150
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:09,223
You been sleeping
on that couch all night?

151
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:11,475
What's this?
Telephone numbers.

152
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:17,648
- And this? - Some roughneck
guy got fresh with Natascha...

153
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:20,526
- in a nightclub and you clipped him.
- I clipped him?

154
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:30,327
- Steward, sir. - Would you bring
me some Alka-Seltzer and ice water?

155
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,205
Yes, sir.

156
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:36,417
- Who's Natascha?
- You don't know Natascha?

157
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,877
You ought to. You were pretty
clubby with her last night.

158
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,004
- What do you mean "clubby"?
- From the verb "club."

159
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,382
To form an association
united by a common interest.

160
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:48,011
- I don't want to hear any more.
Where are we? - Way out at sea.

161
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,973
- When did we leave Hong Kong?
- Two hours ago.

162
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,854
No, I'm gonna take a bath
and get myself together.

163
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,607
- I'll call ya later then.
- Yeah.

164
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,129
Uh, Hudson.

165
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,245
What are you doing, Hudson?

166
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,833
- Just making a note of the telephone
numbers. - Don't bother with them.

167
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,184
- Oh!
- I beg your pardon.

168
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,523
Did I startle you?

169
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:26,526
- Who are you?
- I'm Natascha.

170
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,986
Oh, well, how do you do?

171
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,657
- Are we alone? - I don't know. Maybe
there's somebody under the bed.

172
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,867
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,745
What are you doing
in that closet?

174
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:41,624
- Well, sir, if you'll allow me, I'll
explain everything. - Go ahead.

175
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,418
I don't know whether you remember
the Baroness, the Countess and me?

176
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:46,045
Get to the point.

177
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,469
Then you fell asleep, so everyone left,
but I came back to look for my handbag.

178
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,763
Enough of that.
Why are you hiding in that closet?

179
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:57,723
I've stowed away.

180
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,893
- You what?
- I'm going to America.

181
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:04,522
- Are you crazy?
- Please don't get excited.

182
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:07,108
If you let me stay until the purser's
checked all the passengers...

183
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,485
I'll leave your cabin
and will never bother you again.

184
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,864
If anyone comes, I can hide
in the bathroom or closet.

185
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,998
- Who is it?
- Hudson, sir, with the menu...

186
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,126
in case you should want lunch
before the kitchens close.

187
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,879
Thank you.
Call later, Hudson.

188
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,932
You see how simple it is.

189
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:44,645
After the purser's checked everyone, no one
will know whether I'm a passenger or not.

190
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,523
Now look, the best
thing for you to do is go

191
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,817
straight to the Captain
and tell him what happened.

192
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,694
You were visiting friends
and you were left aboard.

193
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,864
But isn't it awkward if he wants
to know where I slept all night?

194
00:16:55,948 --> 00:17:00,035
Of course not! What do you mean?
Tell him the truth.

195
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:02,996
There's nothing to hide.

196
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:12,506
- Who is it?
- Alka-Seltzer, sir.

197
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:19,096
Thank you, sir.

198
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,856
- Look, I must take my bath and
get dressed now. - Yes, of course.

199
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,402
Do you mind leaving?

200
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,697
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I can wait in the next room.

201
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:41,952
You don't seem to understand. You cannot
wait in this suite. I have friends coming.

202
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:44,579
- But where can I go?
- That's your problem.

203
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,332
- Please let me stay until the purser's
checked everyone. - No, no.

204
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:49,584
I promise. After tonight,
you'll never see me again.

205
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,586
You'll have to leave
these premises immediately.

206
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:54,422
I can't leave dressed like this
in the middle of the day.

207
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,926
- However, you can't stay here.
- I must!

208
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,220
Well, if you insist,
I shall have to ring for the purser.

209
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:06,142
If you do, I'll scream, tear my clothes
and swear you tried to attack me.

210
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,940
- This is blackmail.
- Yes, blackmail.

211
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:15,985
- Oh, no, I didn't mean it. That was
a stupid thing to say. - Certainly was.

212
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:17,695
Of course it isn't
blackmail. I don't want

213
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,489
your money. I want to
get away from Hong Kong.

214
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:22,784
- I tried to tell you that last night...
- You've told me enough.

215
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,786
You wouldn't let me explain.

216
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:27,789
- I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Are you going to leave this cabin? - No.

217
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:30,583
- If you ring the bell, I'll scream.
- We'll see about that.

218
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,585
- Please, I never meant it.
- Stand away from that bell.

219
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:35,546
- No, I won't.
- Then I'll ring from the next room.

220
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,548
Oh!

221
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:41,344
Please, please, I beg you!

222
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:43,930
Now go ahead and scream.

223
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:13,084
Where is that steward?

224
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:23,969
- Steward, would you please
send for the purser? - Yes, sir.

225
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:25,971
Thank you.

226
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,601
Don't bother. I'll go.

227
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:32,978
Well, I'm sorry,
but if I succumb to sympathy...

228
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:36,440
I'd have the whole world
on my neck.

229
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:39,151
Now, if it's just a
question of paying your

230
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:41,945
fare to wherever you
want to go, I'll do that.

231
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,366
But you have to get off
at the next stop.

232
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:48,827
- It's no use. That's Japan.
They'll arrest me. - Why?

233
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:51,747
- I haven't a passport.
- You haven't a passport?

234
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,082
How do you expect to land
in the United States?

235
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:59,004
- I'll get in some way.
- My dear young lady, You haven't a chance.

236
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:02,341
The best thing for you to do
is return to Hong Kong.

237
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:04,593
Never.

238
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:07,638
I'll talk to the purser and see
if we can get you a cabin.

239
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:09,640
Who is it?

240
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:13,560
- The purser, Your Excellency.
- Oh.

241
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,104
- Here, in...
- Oh, yeah.

242
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:22,986
Good afternoon, Your Excellency.

243
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,199
Good afternoon, purser. I'd like to know
if you have an extra berth or cabin.

244
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:30,619
I'm sorry, sir. We haven't a thing.
We're completely full up.

245
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:33,246
There might be something
at Kobi, but I doubt it.

246
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,291
- When do we get to Kobi?
- Tomorrow morning at 11.00, sir.

247
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:40,378
- Thank you. - Is there anything else
I can do for Your Excellency?

248
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,547
No, not a thing. Thank you.

249
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:08,114
Well, they're full up.

250
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,492
- Full up?
- Yeah.

251
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:12,660
We'll manage somehow.

252
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:17,290
Will we? Where do you think
you're gonna sleep tonight?

253
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:20,168
As soon as it's dark,
I can sleep in one of the lifeboats.

254
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:23,880
Whatever made you think
you could get away with this?

255
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:28,468
I didn't think. It was an impulse.
A chance to escape.

256
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:31,054
Escape? Escape from what?
Have you committed a crime?

257
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:34,891
Of course not. Escape from despair,
hopelessness, no future.

258
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:38,561
Nothing to look forward to
but dance halls and prostitution.

259
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:41,314
But I am determined
not to slowly die and rot.

260
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:43,483
Well, that's no excuse for your actions.

261
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:46,110
There's no excuse
for many things in this world.

262
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:48,404
You're getting off at Kobi,
the next stop.

263
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:52,575
- Then I can stay?
- Stay? I can't get rid of ya.

264
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:56,204
Now do you mind going
in the other room while I take a bath?

265
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:58,456
Not at all, Your Excellency.

266
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:01,208
- If anyone knocks, don't answer.
- No, Your Excellency.

267
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:05,171
- Lay off the "Excellency."
- Yes, sir.

268
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:17,224
What are you going to do
about food?

269
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:20,186
It's no hardship to miss
a meal occasionally.

270
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:23,981
- You want me to break down and weep?
- No, but...

271
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:28,903
Well, then, mark down what you want
on the menu while I lock the door.

272
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,209
Now, when you hear a knock like this,
you'll know it's me.

273
00:22:52,134 --> 00:22:54,136
It's Crawford.

274
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,723
Come in, Crawford.

275
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,850
Harvey says not to wait
for him for lunch.

276
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:02,269
He's not feeling too well.
I think he's got an upset stomach.

277
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:04,271
I've got a little
upset stomach myself.

278
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:07,900
Excuse me, sir. The kitchens
will be closed in ten minutes.

279
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:10,861
Oh, here it is.

280
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:15,407
"Chicken a la king,
potato au gratin, string beans...

281
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,369
"cauliflower, a glass of milk
and caramel ice cream...

282
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:21,872
with hot chocolate sauce," sir?

283
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:24,416
That's about it.

284
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:27,419
Oh, no, sir. It's not bad
for an upset stomach.

285
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:58,366
Ogden.

286
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:13,274
Oh, excuse me.

287
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:21,115
Why don't you go to bed?

288
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:23,451
I thought I'd wait for you.

289
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:26,871
Oh, that is, I don't know where to go.

290
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:29,707
You'd better run along
to your lifeboat.

291
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,460
It's no laughing matter.

292
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:36,046
However, you can sleep
in the next room.

293
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,301
- Where are you going to sleep?
- That's my business.

294
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:44,555
There's another bed in the other room,
if you'd care to sleep there.

295
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:47,641
Thank you. I'm sleeping on the sofa.

296
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:17,212
I suppose you have
nothing to sleep in.

297
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:19,423
Oh, don't bother.

298
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:32,352
- Here, you can use these and this.
- Thank you.

299
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:35,647
I'm sorry I don't have
any hairpins or toothbrush.

300
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:39,359
I feel terrible putting you
to all this trouble.

301
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:44,906
Hmm. You can write me to that effect
when you're off this boat.

302
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:24,988
Come in.

303
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,258
Ogden, you mustn't.

304
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:10,575
Please don't turn the radio down.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

305
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:13,869
Sorry.

306
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:41,564
Get up out of there.

307
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:44,858
Oh, I wish you'd let me sleep here.
I feel I'm robbing you of your bed.

308
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:46,860
You're robbing me of my sleep.

309
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:50,572
Look. I'm very comfortable here.

310
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:53,742
Oh! Ah!

311
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:59,164
- Mr Ogden, are you asleep?
- Yes. What is it?

312
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:01,709
It's Crawford. Harvey's been in bed
all day with an upset stomach.

313
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:05,712
- Can ya give him something?
- Just a minute.

314
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,267
- Goodnight, Crawford.
- Goodnight, boss.

315
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:37,494
Now, you get in the other room
and stay there.

316
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:40,122
Be careful.
These pyjamas are transparent.

317
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:44,709
- So are you.
- Goodnight.

318
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,359
Come in.

319
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:15,949
I believe this is yours.

320
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:20,703
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

321
00:30:57,949 --> 00:31:01,244
Up, come on, get up.
We're gonna be in Kobi in 15 minutes.

322
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:37,613
- Now, what are you going to have
for breakfast? - Oh, anything, sir.

323
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:41,450
Two boiled eggs... four minutes...
a little bacon, toast and coffee.

324
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:44,078
Eggs, bacon, toast and coffee.

325
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:47,248
- Oh, and hot milk to go with the coffee.
- Hot milk.

326
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:50,584
- Oh, yes, and marmalade.
- And marmalade.

327
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:53,128
Boiled eggs.
I suppose they're fresh?

328
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,590
I don't know about the eggs.

329
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:06,850
Who is it?

330
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:10,270
Steward, sir.

331
00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:14,066
- Good morning, sir. Breakfast?
- Yes.

332
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:18,278
"Two eggs, bacon, toast and coffee,
hot milk, marmalade."

333
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:20,322
That all, sir?

334
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,784
- Yes, and would you serve it in the
next room, please? - Very good, sir.

335
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:29,915
- What were you doing?
- The bath was overflowing.

336
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:33,710
So I turned the taps off.

337
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:42,010
Good morning, boss. I just came
to tell you a batch of reporters...

338
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,471
got on with the pilot and they're
waiting now to interview you.

339
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:47,432
Morning, Ogden. A batch
of reporters got on with the pilot.

340
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:50,685
- They're waiting to interview you.
- I can't see anybody before breakfast.

341
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,063
Say about 11.00?
They're in the lounge.

342
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:55,857
I can keep them busy for a while,
but it might be a good idea...

343
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,985
to bring them here and give them a drink
and sandwich to sweeten them up.

344
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:05,158
Harvey, I'll see you after breakfast.
I have to collect myself.

345
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:11,164
Good. Fine.
I'll see you after breakfast.

346
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:13,583
R-Right after breakfast.

347
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,438
What... What
do you want, Hudson?

348
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:39,692
- To prepare your bath, sir.
- I've had my bath.

349
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:44,113
Just a moment.

350
00:33:44,197 --> 00:33:47,116
May I have the key,
if you don't mind?

351
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,960
- It's Ogden.
- I beg your pardon, Your Excellency.

352
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,978
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, that's all.

353
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:17,980
Thank you, sir.

354
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,073
It's Ogden. Hurry up.

355
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:29,492
- This door is broken.
- I know.

356
00:34:29,575 --> 00:34:32,912
- Hurry up and eat your breakfast.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

357
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:40,252
Oh! Like a silver garden.

358
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:42,505
How lovely.

359
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:45,341
- Hurry up and eat!
- Oh! Yes, sir.

360
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:52,223
I ordered boiled eggs and they've
scrambled them, but it doesn't matter.

361
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:55,226
Will you please hurry up? We're gonna
be in Kobi in just a few minutes now.

362
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:57,561
I'm doing my best, sir.

363
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:59,772
You should have been up
and dressed an hour ago.

364
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:02,316
But I haven't got
any clothes to wear.

365
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,526
What? Y-You have
a dress in there!

366
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:07,821
That's for the evening. I can't appear at
11.00 in the morning in an evening dress.

367
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,949
You should have thought
about that before.

368
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:14,870
Wait. There's a dress shop at the top
of the stairs. Ladies dress shop.

369
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:16,872
- What are your measurements?
- Hmm?

370
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:18,874
- How tall are you?
- Five foot 7.

371
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:22,419
What about around here?

372
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:25,297
Never mind that.
What about here?

373
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,925
- Modesty forbids.
- Oh!

374
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:32,679
Now, listen. Remember when I leave,
lock both doors.

375
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,238
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

376
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:53,325
I'd like to have a lady's suit
for someone about 5 feet 7.

377
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:55,368
I'm afraid we've nothing in stock.

378
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:59,039
- What's all this? - Samples, sir. Our main
stores are in London and New York.

379
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:05,086
Yes, sir.

380
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:31,321
Ogden!

381
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:36,993
Here. Here's some clothes.

382
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:43,500
Yes, sir.

383
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:02,852
- Aren't you ready yet?
- I'm trying to get ready, sir, but...

384
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:05,855
You are not trying to get ready.
I've had just about enough of this.

385
00:37:05,938 --> 00:37:08,483
- I'm not gonna stand...
- I gave you my measurements, but...

386
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:10,943
Listen, I'm not interested in
the problem off your measurements.

387
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:14,530
- I'm interested in you getting out
this door right now. - What is this for?

388
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:16,824
If you're not off this boat
in two minutes...

389
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:23,664
- Who is it?
- Steward, sir.

390
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:26,000
- Yes, sir?
- Clear these things away.

391
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,961
Yes, sir.

392
00:37:48,314 --> 00:37:51,901
- Aren't you ready yet?
- But it's all too big!

393
00:37:51,984 --> 00:37:55,321
- Haven't they got something smaller?
- That's the smallest they have.

394
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:58,908
- What am I to do?
- "Do"? Get dressed and get off the boat!

395
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,289
Then you'll go as you are.

396
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:08,626
In your pyjamas?

397
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:12,796
- Take off those pyjamas.
- Would that look nice?

398
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,466
Take off those pyjamas
or I'll tear them off.

399
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:17,885
- Oh!
- You heard what I said.

400
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:21,221
- Take 'em off.
- Oh, please, my nerves.

401
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:23,682
- Take them off.
- Oh, this is silly.

402
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:26,727
- You'll see how silly this is.
- Oh!

403
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,729
Ah!

404
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:34,776
Take 'em off.

405
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,030
Oh, please. Do you want me
to call the Captain?

406
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:41,408
Oh, but really.
What are we doing?

407
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:43,410
Ooh! Ooh! Oh, dear!

408
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:47,956
You'll get off this boat if I...

409
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,125
Who is it?

410
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,836
It's Crawford, sir.

411
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:57,424
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
Please be seated.

412
00:38:57,507 --> 00:38:59,843
- How do you do?
- Good morning.

413
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:02,929
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

414
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:22,157
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce
His Excellency, Ogden Mears?

415
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,702
- How do you do? - Good morning. How
many in your party, Mr Mears?

416
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:29,039
There are three of us,
Mr Crothers, Mr Crawford and myself.

417
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:33,376
- I understand you've been made Ambassador
to Saudi Arabia. - Yes, that's right.

418
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,712
Are you going
directly there now?

419
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:39,048
No, I'll go to Washington
for the usual formalities.

420
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:43,011
- Is your wife going with you?
- I hope so.

421
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:45,847
Mr Ambassador,
what is your solution for peace?

422
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,894
The solution for peace
lies in man himself.

423
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:54,689
In this atomic age
and the power of military might...

424
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:57,483
- Wait, I'll get you a towel.
- Liberty, freedom and justice...

425
00:39:57,567 --> 00:40:02,530
are generalities that have been
quoted as an excuse for aggression.

426
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:06,784
- Ah!
- Nature has given us...

427
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:09,746
the, uh, technological ability to...

428
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:13,708
...military might, but is built
on the foundation of peace...

429
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:17,170
and goodwill to all men.

430
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:21,424
In this atomic age,
only the morality of man...

431
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:24,552
can help him to survive.

432
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:27,096
The solution for peace is in truth...

433
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,683
and tolerance and understanding.

434
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:33,978
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- That will be all, ladies and gentlemen.

435
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:37,273
- Refreshments over here, please.
- Ogden, I've got to talk to you.

436
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:39,275
- Not now, old man.
- But, Ogden!

437
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,277
I'm sorry. I need rest.
I'm going back to bed.

438
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,699
Are you kidding? A dame
in your bathroom. I went to get a towel.

439
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:50,536
I'll talk to you about that later
on the Promenade Deck.

440
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:57,668
She says she's a stowaway
and she's going to America.

441
00:40:57,751 --> 00:41:00,754
How did she get
into your pyjamas?

442
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,342
Like a fool, I loaned her a pair
of my pyjamas to sleep in.

443
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:10,055
Well, you'll have to pay her off.

444
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,475
I offered to pay her expenses back
to Hong Kong, but she won't take it.

445
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,103
That's peanuts.
She's out for big dough.

446
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,314
Why don't you get off the boat
and leave her flat?

447
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:23,235
Too late.

448
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:26,029
I've gotta do something.
I just can't leave her...

449
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:28,949
downstairs in that cabin
with my pyjamas.

450
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:33,120
It puts me in a terrible spot.
What am I gonna do?

451
00:41:33,203 --> 00:41:37,875
All right. Let's go to lunch
and afterwards you let me talk to her.

452
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:09,531
Mr Mears.

453
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:12,159
- Oh!
- That's all right. This is Mr Crothers.

454
00:42:12,242 --> 00:42:14,202
You met him this morning
in the bathroom, I believe.

455
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:17,873
- How do you do?
- Well, I see you've been playing chess.

456
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:20,876
- Alone?
- Yes.

457
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,712
I took the liberty of putting on
another pair of your pyjamas...

458
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:26,381
after the other one
had been ripped off.

459
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:30,927
- Where's the torn one? - I hid it. I
didn't think you wanted anyone to see it.

460
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:34,472
- You think I give a damn who sees it?
- You spoilt my move.

461
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:38,893
Now, now, Ogden. Let's settle
this thing without any bitterness.

462
00:42:38,977 --> 00:42:44,274
Natascha, I understand
you want to go to America.

463
00:42:44,357 --> 00:42:46,401
- Yes.
- Good.

464
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:50,238
Now, Ogden tells me you have
neither a passport nor a visa.

465
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:53,658
- I don't need them.
- What makes you think you don't need them?

466
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:56,452
- Because I haven't got them.
- Fair enough.

467
00:42:56,536 --> 00:42:59,581
- See, she's insane.
- Because I haven't a passport?

468
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:02,584
What's the use
of arguing with her?

469
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,003
Don't you realize
that you'll be caught?

470
00:43:05,086 --> 00:43:07,005
I have no intention
of being caught.

471
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:21,102
- Who is it?
- Chief Steward, sir.

472
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:24,564
Excuse me. Do you mind
closing all your port-holes, sir?

473
00:43:24,647 --> 00:43:27,108
Yes, it seems to be
blowing up out there.

474
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:29,694
Just a little sloppy. Nothing serious.

475
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,696
Yes.

476
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:35,950
All clear.

477
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:43,499
- What are you hiding for?
- Me? I don't know.

478
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:46,877
However, let's get down to business.

479
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:56,470
Natascha, I like you.

480
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:58,472
And I think
I'm a good judge of character.

481
00:43:58,556 --> 00:44:02,893
You mustn't mind Ogden.
He's a little abrupt, but he means well.

482
00:44:02,977 --> 00:44:07,815
Well, you mean well, but he hasn't
approached you in the right way.

483
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,942
I'm sure you don't
want to ruin his career.

484
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:12,319
All I want is to get to America.

485
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:16,073
Well, that can be arranged, if you'll
get off at Tokyo and take another boat.

486
00:44:26,709 --> 00:44:30,754
If you get off at Tokyo,
I'll give you $25,000.

487
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:33,340
You don't seem to understand.
I don't want money.

488
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:35,676
This is a trick and you're
not getting away with it.

489
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:38,387
Natascha, how much
do you want?

490
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,808
- I don't want money.
- And I don't want this.

491
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:45,686
- We'll give you $50,000.
- There's no use in arguing.

492
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,689
Best thing to do is go to the Captain
and tell him the whole story.

493
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:52,234
Then I'll tell him my side. How you
kidnapped me, locked me in your cabin...

494
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:55,404
and after attacking me,
tried to get rid of me.

495
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:59,533
Do you think I give
a hoot for your threats?

496
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:06,039
Now, wait a minute.
This is getting us nowhere.

497
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:09,543
Ogden, you can catch
more flies with honey...

498
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:12,379
than you can with...

499
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:15,048
With what?

500
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:17,884
Well, I'd say mustard or vinegar.

501
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,471
Mustard and vinegar?

502
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:25,308
What's that got to do with it?

503
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,316
Well, you can get more
with honey. Honey, huh.

504
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,945
Now, listen, "Natischa."
If Ogden goes to the Captain...

505
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:41,658
he'll believe him before he'll believe
you, and you'll be sent to jail.

506
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:47,122
If you'll get off the boat at Tokyo
without a scandal, we'll give you $ 75,000.

507
00:45:47,205 --> 00:45:51,084
I don't want money.

508
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:54,379
Ogden, you're dealing
with an odd character.

509
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:58,925
This is a hold-up.
I'm going straight to the Captain.

510
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:01,719
Don't do anything rash, Ogden.

511
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:07,976
Ogden?

512
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:13,690
Ogden, before you do anything...

513
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:37,046
Out!

514
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:43,719
What do you think
you're doing? Oh.

515
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:50,142
Harvey, ring for some ice water.

516
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:02,488
You leave this cabin immediately.

517
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:49,076
- Well, good morning, Ogden.
- Hello, Harv.

518
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:51,411
- How do you feel?
- Wonderful.

519
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:54,706
Good. Say, you had
quite a siege of it.

520
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,125
For a while there,
I thought it was serious.

521
00:47:57,209 --> 00:48:00,087
It was a touch of the old malaria.
I get it every once in a while.

522
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,839
- But now I feel great.
- Good.

523
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:08,428
- Say, uh, how's the situation down below?
- I don't know what to think.

524
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:11,515
She stayed up two days and nights
dosing me with quinine...

525
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:14,059
and taking my temperature.

526
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:17,312
She wanted to send for the ship's doctor
when she thought it was serious.

527
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:19,314
Of course I stopped her.

528
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:23,360
Three days we arrive in Honolulu,
then she says she'll disappear.

529
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:28,114
- I'll miss her.
- So will I.

530
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:32,327
I'll miss the tension,
the excitement of it all.

531
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,801
We were wondering
what had become of you.

532
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,595
- Well, I...
- I hope you haven't been seasick.

533
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,224
- Actually, it was quite something else.
- Everybody's been seasick.

534
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:57,227
At least it'll give them
something to talk about at dinner.

535
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,687
How sick they were,
what they ate.

536
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:03,608
Daddy says it's surprising what people will
talk about to make themselves interesting.

537
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,836
- I can't do that.
- Oh, yes, you can.

538
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,924
I'll show you.
There. Isn't it wonderful?

539
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:32,595
I think dancing
stimulates conversation.

540
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,098
Wasn't it Aristotle who used to walk and

541
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:38,017
lecture around the Lyceum
and talk of the soul?

542
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,021
Though Daddy says he never had
a clear idea of what the soul is.

543
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:46,651
But Daddy has.
He says the soul is desire.

544
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,195
And that the whole of life is desire.

545
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,489
I think it's a wonderful idea.

546
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:54,367
Well, if you can't shimmy,
we'll just dance ordinary.

547
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:03,167
Do you believe
in the immortality of the soul?

548
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,170
- Well... - Daddy does. He
believes that when we die...

549
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,091
our souls go on until they're
reborn again through love.

550
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,676
- Love?
- You don't believe in love?

551
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,012
- Well, I...
- Daddy does.

552
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:19,683
He loves everybody,
except the Communists.

553
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,978
- You're in the Diplomatic
Service, aren't you? - Yes.

554
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:27,149
How boring it must be
to be diplomatic to everyone.

555
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:30,402
- But you're Ambassador to
Arabia, aren't you? - Yes, I...

556
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:33,030
- Have you been there before?
- Oh, yes.

557
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:37,201
- Do tell me about it. I adore Arabs.
- Well, the Arabs are very inter...

558
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:41,830
Quite a crowd tonight. You'd never suspect
that most of them have been seasick.

559
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,921
Her empty chair is next to mine
in the dining room.

560
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:54,051
I'm so intrigued to see
what she looks like.

561
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:59,556
It's Harvey!

562
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,228
Peek-a-boo.

563
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,898
Well, I-I see you're
enjoying yourself.

564
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:11,652
I thought I'd come see that you
weren't getting into any mischief.

565
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,113
- Mischief?
- Well, it's a difficult situation.

566
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,657
I'll be glad when it's over.

567
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,995
- You really think you'll be able to
land in the States? - Oh, yes.

568
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,416
I sincerely wish you all the luck
in the world. I know Ogden does.

569
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,794
Ogden?

570
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:32,130
Oh, yes, he...
He speaks very well of you.

571
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,049
That's surprising.

572
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,259
Well, it's all difficult.

573
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:40,096
These close quarters. He's very
suspicious. You're very attractive.

574
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,350
That's what he's fighting against.

575
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,518
He seems to have won.

576
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,104
Unfortunately,
it started out the wrong way.

577
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,106
But he'll miss you.

578
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,400
Hmm.

579
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,903
Oh, yes. He said so himself.

580
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:58,490
He'll be only too glad
to get rid of me.

581
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,867
I don't know.

582
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,078
- What's he doing upstairs?
- Dancing with some young blonde.

583
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,375
- Is she pretty?
- Well, she's young.

584
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,422
Hey, what are you doing?
You put the five in the wrong place.

585
00:52:19,844 --> 00:52:23,723
Electrician to fix the lights
in the sitting room and bedroom.

586
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:27,769
- Could you come back in half an hour?
- Very well, sir.

587
00:52:27,852 --> 00:52:30,813
It's the electrician to fix the lights
here and in the bedroom.

588
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,900
They've been here every ten minutes,
rapping on the door.

589
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:37,820
- Now they have a passkey.
- I don't like that passkey business.

590
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,531
I think you'd be safer upstairs dancing.

591
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:46,245
- Ogden would be furious. - Not when I tell
him about the electrician with the passkey.

592
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,081
Well, if I'm caught, it's better
to be upstairs than down here.

593
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:53,794
Now that's the spirit! If you stay
down here, you'll go stir crazy.

594
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,199
- You stay here. I'll find Ogden.
- Don't leave me alone!

595
00:53:23,282 --> 00:53:25,201
No. No. I'll only be a minute.

596
00:53:25,284 --> 00:53:28,829
- Excuse me. May I have this dance?
- Harvey!

597
00:53:28,913 --> 00:53:33,250
No, it's all right. How do you do?
I'll meet you back here.

598
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:46,388
Why aren't you dancing, Captain?

599
00:53:46,472 --> 00:53:49,349
I was just about to ask
this very attractive young lady.

600
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:53,771
You better be nice to him.
We're all under his control.

601
00:53:58,275 --> 00:54:02,529
I've been wondering about
the immortality of the soul.

602
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:10,537
Change your partners.

603
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:20,422
Change your partners.

604
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:28,055
I don't think I've seen you
throughout the voyage.

605
00:54:28,138 --> 00:54:31,892
- Of course, you're the lady who's
been confined to her cabin. - Yes, yes.

606
00:54:31,975 --> 00:54:35,187
It's a pity you're such a poor sailor.
However, that's our misfortune.

607
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:46,406
- Change your partners.
- Thank you so much.

608
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:58,668
Why did you leave the room?

609
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:01,921
The electricians wanted to fix the lights.
They have a passkey.

610
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:04,174
- You mean they saw you?
- Of course not.

611
00:55:04,257 --> 00:55:07,343
- Harvey answered the door.
- What was he doing there?

612
00:55:07,427 --> 00:55:11,014
I'm lucky he was there.
Otherwise, they would have seen me.

613
00:55:11,097 --> 00:55:13,224
What were you and the
Captain talking about?

614
00:55:13,224 --> 00:55:15,018
He asked if I was enjoying the trip.

615
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:18,313
- What did you tell him?
- I said every moment of it.

616
00:55:25,945 --> 00:55:28,406
Change your partners.

617
00:55:33,453 --> 00:55:37,540
Natascha! What are you
doing away from Hong Kong?

618
00:55:37,623 --> 00:55:40,334
- I'm going to San Francisco.
- Alone?

619
00:55:40,418 --> 00:55:44,213
- I'm looking for a job. - You don't
have to look far. I'll give you a job.

620
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:47,717
Oh, no. I'm not looking
for that kind of work.

621
00:55:56,642 --> 00:56:00,104
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you around the whole trip.

622
00:56:00,187 --> 00:56:03,691
- I've been confined to my cabin.
- Hiding from someone?

623
00:56:03,774 --> 00:56:07,361
- I've been very sick.
- Where is your cabin?

624
00:56:07,445 --> 00:56:10,364
- None of your business.
- All right, I'll find out from the purser.

625
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:23,752
- Let's go to the bar and have a drink.
- No, I'm very tired. I'm going to bed.

626
00:56:23,836 --> 00:56:25,754
- I'll go with you.
- No, you won't.

627
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:28,757
- Then have a drink.
- I'm going straight to my cabin.

628
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:31,552
You can't get rid of
me. I'm either going

629
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:34,555
to your cabin or we're
going to have a drink.

630
00:56:34,638 --> 00:56:36,765
I'll have a drink.

631
00:56:41,312 --> 00:56:44,565
- I told her to meet me here.
- Where are they?

632
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:47,568
Oh, there they are at the bar.

633
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:51,739
- I wonder what they're talking about.
- Let's go and listen.

634
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:14,177
- Yes, sir.
- A martini.

635
00:57:14,261 --> 00:57:16,179
- And you?
- Beer.

636
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:20,767
Hey, come on, honey,
where is your cabin?

637
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:24,104
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- Come clean, honey. Don't play the virgin.

638
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:26,106
Virgin? What's that?

639
00:57:26,189 --> 00:57:30,027
I see I'll have to teach you
the facts of life.

640
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,530
Now, listen, honey, I...

641
00:57:40,787 --> 00:57:45,125
- Still playing hard to get?
- No, hard to please.

642
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:48,336
What's wrong with me?
Have I got leprosy or something?

643
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,338
Yes.

644
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:53,883
Whether I have or not,
I'm going with you.

645
00:57:59,556 --> 00:58:02,976
They must be in the other corridor.
I'll go 'round, meet them face on.

646
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:05,603
Okay.

647
00:58:05,687 --> 00:58:09,023
- Natascha, come on.
- Really, I must say goodnight.

648
00:58:09,107 --> 00:58:13,027
- Why the anticlimax?
- Hello, chum! How've you been?

649
00:58:13,111 --> 00:58:15,864
- Say, how's the wife?
- Who are you?

650
00:58:15,947 --> 00:58:19,159
Are you kidding? I'm the brother
of that guy who sold you the used Pontiac.

651
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:21,870
- Let's have a drink.
- I don't know you.

652
00:58:21,953 --> 00:58:24,205
Of course you do. You've been talking
to my sister all night.

653
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:26,624
- That's not your sister.
- It's not my uncle.

654
00:58:38,303 --> 00:58:40,263
Ogden.

655
00:58:51,983 --> 00:58:56,696
I hope you enjoyed yourself,
letting everybody know you were here.

656
00:58:56,779 --> 00:58:59,365
Flaunting and parading
around this ship.

657
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:03,035
What are you trying to do?
Ruin my career, destroy me?

658
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:07,707
I was beginning to
believe in you, trust you.

659
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:10,710
I thought there was something decent,
something worthwhile.

660
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:14,005
But you're just a common harlot.

661
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:23,389
Dragging me into
your sordid intrigues.

662
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:26,058
Leering into the face
of that stupid paramour of yours.

663
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:28,727
Why don't you go hide
in his cabin?

664
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:34,066
- Why don't you torment him?
- I won't torment you any longer.

665
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:39,738
It has not been cheerful for me either
to endure your contempt every day.

666
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:42,575
I thought I could take it, but I can't.

667
00:59:42,658 --> 00:59:44,577
You win.

668
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,838
No. No, I won't.

669
00:59:55,921 --> 00:59:58,298
You're crazy.

670
01:00:01,593 --> 01:00:04,179
Maybe.

671
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:11,687
- Where you going?
- To the purser and give myself up.

672
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:16,024
Oh, don't worry. I'll keep your
spotless reputation out of it.

673
01:00:16,108 --> 01:00:18,860
I'll tell him I've been hiding
in second class.

674
01:00:18,944 --> 01:00:21,321
Why this sudden change
in attitude?

675
01:00:22,406 --> 01:00:26,827
- Why yours?
- You know why.

676
01:00:44,136 --> 01:00:48,557
Good morning, purser. Could you tell
me the cabin number of Miss Natascha...

677
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,142
I don't know her other name,
but I know her quite well.

678
01:00:51,226 --> 01:00:53,728
- Perhaps you mean Miss Gaulswallow.
- Who?

679
01:00:53,812 --> 01:00:56,022
Gaulswallow.

680
01:00:56,106 --> 01:00:59,025
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I don't think she wants to be disturbed.

681
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:01,861
Okay, but I'd like to
send her some flowers.

682
01:01:11,996 --> 01:01:15,500
Flowers for Miss Gaulswallow.

683
01:01:17,836 --> 01:01:20,630
Oh, dear, dear.
I don't know him.

684
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,386
Take them away.
They take up all the oxygen.

685
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:30,139
They take up all the oxygen.

686
01:01:32,183 --> 01:01:35,228
Anna Pooh, my old friend.

687
01:01:35,311 --> 01:01:37,563
Oh, that red tongue!

688
01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:39,607
Nurse!

689
01:01:39,691 --> 01:01:42,068
Take my Russian friend away.

690
01:01:42,151 --> 01:01:45,738
He's too big
and I don't like his red tongue.

691
01:01:45,822 --> 01:01:49,450
Ohh, ohh, more colours.

692
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,871
Oh, not that.
No more of that.

693
01:01:53,955 --> 01:01:57,416
I don't like the green either.
Put that right away.

694
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,378
Ooh! How awful.

695
01:02:00,461 --> 01:02:02,672
In the drawer, please.

696
01:02:04,966 --> 01:02:08,052
Give me the chocolates.

697
01:02:10,137 --> 01:02:12,056
The Captain, madam.

698
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:14,392
Well, I... I...

699
01:02:14,475 --> 01:02:18,896
Captain!
Oh, how nice of you.

700
01:02:20,314 --> 01:02:22,984
Chocolates.

701
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:26,070
Oh, how perfectly charming.

702
01:02:26,153 --> 01:02:30,741
Nurse, will you
put these by the port-hole?

703
01:02:30,825 --> 01:02:34,078
Just the sort of thing
my nephews will enjoy.

704
01:02:35,746 --> 01:02:38,040
Nurse!
My thermometer.

705
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:43,420
Give it to me.
I'll shake the thing myself.

706
01:02:53,389 --> 01:02:56,350
Nurse, where's
my thermometer?

707
01:02:56,433 --> 01:03:00,688
I've lost my thermometer.
Or did I swallow it?

708
01:03:03,774 --> 01:03:06,360
Come in!

709
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:16,370
What was that?
Something flew in and then flew out.

710
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:20,666
Must have been a bat.

711
01:03:33,136 --> 01:03:37,641
The man that looked after you since
you were 14, was he a White Russian?

712
01:03:37,724 --> 01:03:39,643
Yes.

713
01:03:41,395 --> 01:03:43,563
Was he married?

714
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:46,566
Yes. Separated from his wife.

715
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:51,404
He was a desperate man.

716
01:03:51,488 --> 01:03:55,158
They say he was a gangster,
but he was very kind to me.

717
01:03:55,242 --> 01:03:58,245
God knows what I would have
done without him.

718
01:03:58,328 --> 01:04:00,539
Did you love him?

719
01:04:00,622 --> 01:04:02,749
I was too young.

720
01:04:02,832 --> 01:04:04,751
How old was he?

721
01:04:06,253 --> 01:04:09,214
Sixty-three when he died.

722
01:04:14,386 --> 01:04:16,304
What's the matter?

723
01:04:16,388 --> 01:04:18,306
Me? Nothing.

724
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:24,521
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

725
01:04:24,604 --> 01:04:29,359
At 10.00 I have to look for Crawford
and send some cablegrams.

726
01:04:29,442 --> 01:04:31,444
You look worried.

727
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:35,907
I'm just wondering
how you're going to land in the States.

728
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,951
Please don't worry about it.

729
01:04:38,034 --> 01:04:42,038
You have to be realistic.
In two days, you're going to be in Hawaii.

730
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:47,335
Yes, I'm getting off there. It will be
easier getting into the States that way.

731
01:04:47,418 --> 01:04:52,215
- Suppose you get into trouble.
- Whatever happens, you won't be involved.

732
01:04:52,298 --> 01:04:56,928
You have to be realistic, face facts.
What are your plans?

733
01:04:57,011 --> 01:05:00,598
I can supply you with money,
but supposing you do get into trouble?

734
01:05:00,681 --> 01:05:04,852
- I'd like to be of some help.
- Please don't feel obligated.

735
01:05:04,936 --> 01:05:08,898
The moment we arrive in Honolulu,
I shall have vanished.

736
01:05:08,981 --> 01:05:12,360
You're so remote, so alone.

737
01:05:12,443 --> 01:05:14,362
That's what saddens me.

738
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:20,034
Don't be sad. That's too easy.

739
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:22,036
Be like me.

740
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:28,292
- At this moment, I'm very happy.
- This moment.

741
01:05:28,376 --> 01:05:31,212
That's all we can ask for.

742
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:33,214
This moment.

743
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,093
There'll be many moments.

744
01:05:37,176 --> 01:05:39,386
I wonder.

745
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,388
Of course.

746
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:46,018
Our lives are so different,
so far apart.

747
01:05:46,101 --> 01:05:48,979
No need to be, if we're discreet.

748
01:05:50,606 --> 01:05:55,027
I hate to leave, but it's 10.00
and I have to send those cablegrams.

749
01:05:56,904 --> 01:05:59,323
Oh. Don't worry.

750
01:05:59,406 --> 01:06:03,202
I want to help, and I can.
But I must know your plans.

751
01:06:04,578 --> 01:06:08,165
And meanwhile, don't vanish.
We still have two more days.

752
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:10,376
I won't.

753
01:06:33,106 --> 01:06:35,567
It's Harvey.

754
01:06:43,617 --> 01:06:45,535
Good morning.

755
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:48,038
I just met your boyfriend
who pursued you last night.

756
01:06:48,121 --> 01:06:50,791
He's still roaming the boat,
looking for your room number.

757
01:06:54,586 --> 01:06:56,505
Am I intruding?

758
01:06:59,257 --> 01:07:01,468
Two more days.

759
01:07:03,094 --> 01:07:06,181
Yep. I could see it coming.

760
01:07:06,264 --> 01:07:08,683
Both of you falling in love.

761
01:07:10,101 --> 01:07:12,687
I don't know about Ogden...

762
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:15,607
but this is a new experience for me.

763
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:19,235
Well, it happens in the best
of regulated families.

764
01:07:20,695 --> 01:07:24,032
I don't want to fall in love.

765
01:07:24,115 --> 01:07:27,368
I think he's very fond of you.

766
01:07:29,788 --> 01:07:34,042
However, if you ever got into trouble,
his friendship could be very useful.

767
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:36,794
Oh, it's all so hopeless.

768
01:07:36,878 --> 01:07:39,005
I don't agree.

769
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,593
Well, in two days, it will be over.

770
01:07:45,178 --> 01:07:48,640
- You're leaving at Honolulu?
- Yes.

771
01:07:48,723 --> 01:07:53,061
- Have you thought about what
you're going to do? - I have a plan.

772
01:07:53,144 --> 01:07:55,355
Well, it better be a good one.

773
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:59,025
Harvey?

774
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:02,070
If I tell you, promise me
you won't tell Ogden.

775
01:08:02,153 --> 01:08:06,449
- Why?
- He's very conservative. He might object.

776
01:08:06,532 --> 01:08:09,702
- What are you going to do?
- Dive off the boat.

777
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:13,206
Oh, honey, where did you get that idea?
You'll break your neck!

778
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:17,043
Oh, no, no. In Hawaii, they come
in little boats and dive for money.

779
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:20,379
Some climb aboard
and dive off the boat. I can do that.

780
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:59,168
How fortunate that
my chair's next to yours.

781
01:09:02,588 --> 01:09:05,049
Now we can talk.

782
01:09:06,634 --> 01:09:10,846
I'm interrupting your reading.
How inconsiderate of me.

783
01:09:10,929 --> 01:09:14,850
Nothing's more annoying than to have
someone interrupt your reading.

784
01:09:14,933 --> 01:09:19,521
Daddy says it's a lack
of consideration for other people.

785
01:09:19,605 --> 01:09:22,649
Where's your friend, the Ambassador?

786
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:26,528
He seems to have erased himself
completely during the voyage.

787
01:09:26,612 --> 01:09:30,866
Daddy says that people who erase
themselves have a profound shyness...

788
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:34,703
which really means that they're
afraid of exposing themselves.

789
01:09:34,786 --> 01:09:36,747
Hmm.

790
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:40,667
Oh, the silence is frightening.

791
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:43,086
Would you like some more music?

792
01:09:46,923 --> 01:09:50,469
Mrs Martha Mears,
wife of Ambassador Ogden Mears...

793
01:09:50,552 --> 01:09:53,555
will await her husband's arrival
in Honolulu this evening.

794
01:09:53,638 --> 01:09:55,849
Rumours have been rife that
the Ambassador and his wife...

795
01:09:55,932 --> 01:09:57,851
are getting a divorce.

796
01:09:57,934 --> 01:10:02,355
Nevertheless, Mrs Mears says she will
accompany her husband to Washington.

797
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:06,026
- He's getting a divorce!
- Excuse me.

798
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:15,201
Your wife's waiting for you in Honolulu.
It just came over the radio.

799
01:10:15,285 --> 01:10:17,537
I know. I just got a telegram.

800
01:10:17,621 --> 01:10:20,540
She's coming aboard this evening
and she's not getting a divorce.

801
01:10:20,624 --> 01:10:22,542
What about Natascha?

802
01:10:22,626 --> 01:10:24,544
That's the problem.

803
01:10:24,627 --> 01:10:27,213
You've got to think fast.
We arrive at 9.30.

804
01:10:27,297 --> 01:10:30,925
- You've got to get her out of your cabin!
- Where's she gonna go?

805
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:34,054
- She can sleep in my cabin.
- That's out.

806
01:10:36,806 --> 01:10:38,892
You didn't let me finish.

807
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:41,311
I could double in
with Crawford or Hudson.

808
01:10:41,394 --> 01:10:44,397
Crawford and Hudson
are staying with two other fellows.

809
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:48,902
- You can't let her stay where she is.
- Obviously not.

810
01:10:48,985 --> 01:10:52,322
I've got it. You can say
she's married to Hudson.

811
01:10:52,405 --> 01:10:56,743
- Hudson? - Say, that's an idea. If she
was married to an American citizen...

812
01:10:56,826 --> 01:10:59,912
she could get into the States
without any trouble.

813
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:11,215
- You wish to see me, sir?
- Yes, Hudson. Sit down.

814
01:11:11,299 --> 01:11:13,217
Thank you, sir.

815
01:11:14,552 --> 01:11:17,597
- Would you like a drink?
- Uh, no, thank you, sir.

816
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,600
Uh, Hudson, you are
an American citizen, aren't you?

817
01:11:20,683 --> 01:11:24,270
I've been an American citizen
for the past 16 years, sir.

818
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:28,274
- Good. I want you to do me a favour.
- Yes, sir.

819
01:11:28,357 --> 01:11:32,361
You remember that attractive lady
I was dancing with last night?

820
01:11:32,445 --> 01:11:34,363
I do, sir.

821
01:11:34,447 --> 01:11:36,907
Well, I want you to marry her.

822
01:11:38,242 --> 01:11:41,162
- Marry who, sir?
- The lady I just mentioned.

823
01:11:41,245 --> 01:11:44,498
It'll only be a temporary affair,
and afterwards, you can get a divorce.

824
01:11:44,582 --> 01:11:48,002
If I may say so, sir,
this is rather sudden.

825
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,423
I think I will take
a brandy after all, sir.

826
01:11:52,506 --> 01:11:57,928
I agree it's somewhat extemporaneous,
but it's a matter of urgency.

827
01:11:58,012 --> 01:12:00,431
If the lady is married to
an American citizen...

828
01:12:00,514 --> 01:12:03,100
she'll have little trouble
getting into the States.

829
01:12:03,183 --> 01:12:06,020
And when does all this
happen, sir?

830
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:08,147
In about ten minutes.

831
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:13,944
- I still have to speak to the lady,
of course. - She doesn't know yet?

832
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:17,531
Oh, no, not yet. But don't worry.
We're arranging that.

833
01:12:17,614 --> 01:12:21,035
I think you should
be married before lunch.

834
01:12:21,118 --> 01:12:23,370
You will have a brandy?

835
01:12:23,454 --> 01:12:25,414
Make it a double, if you please, sir.

836
01:12:25,497 --> 01:12:29,835
Double brandy, please.
I'll have the same. Thank you.

837
01:12:32,838 --> 01:12:36,258
If I might ask a rather
connubial question, sir...

838
01:12:36,341 --> 01:12:39,845
what happens this evening,
that is, tonight?

839
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:41,847
After the marriage.

840
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:44,683
Oh, nothing that
concerns you, Hudson.

841
01:12:44,766 --> 01:12:48,937
You'll be sleeping in the same room,
but in different beds.

842
01:12:50,564 --> 01:12:54,484
I think you should be
getting yourself ready.

843
01:12:54,568 --> 01:12:58,155
I think you can wear an ordinary
lounge suit for the wedding.

844
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:00,323
- Yes, sir.
- Fine.

845
01:13:00,407 --> 01:13:05,162
And while you're getting dressed,
I'll talk to the lady.

846
01:13:05,245 --> 01:13:07,205
Thank you.

847
01:13:15,422 --> 01:13:18,675
What's this I hear?
I'm to marry Hudson?

848
01:13:18,758 --> 01:13:21,678
- Well, it's an emergency.
- Yes, but Hudson!

849
01:13:21,761 --> 01:13:25,015
It'll solve all our problems.
You'll be married to an American citizen.

850
01:13:25,098 --> 01:13:27,100
You'll have little
trouble getting into the

851
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,185
States, and afterwards
you can get a divorce.

852
01:13:29,269 --> 01:13:34,149
I've got nothing to wear.
I can't get married in your pyjamas.

853
01:13:34,232 --> 01:13:36,359
Harvey!

854
01:13:36,443 --> 01:13:39,696
It's all arranged. Captain'll
be down in a couple minutes.

855
01:13:39,779 --> 01:13:43,366
- What did you tell him? - I gave him a
line about how her papers blew overboard.

856
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,369
She met Hudson, they fell in love.
Well, the Captain's on.

857
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:49,539
He understands the situation,
but it's gonna cost you dough.

858
01:13:49,622 --> 01:13:53,042
- How's the happy bride?
- I wish I were back in Hong Kong.

859
01:13:56,629 --> 01:13:58,590
That's the Captain.

860
01:14:01,926 --> 01:14:04,012
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

861
01:14:04,095 --> 01:14:08,057
This is to be kept
strictly confidential.

862
01:14:08,141 --> 01:14:11,519
- I understand, Mr Mears.
- Mr Harvey has explained everything.

863
01:14:11,602 --> 01:14:14,939
Good. I assure you
it will be deeply appreciated.

864
01:14:15,022 --> 01:14:19,527
We're only too pleased
to help out in such matters.

865
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,530
- Who is it?
- Hudson, sir.

866
01:14:24,282 --> 01:14:26,200
- You're late.
- I'm sorry, sir.

867
01:14:26,284 --> 01:14:29,537
Captain, I'd like to present Hudson,
the, uh, bridegroom.

868
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:33,207
How do you do?
Now, where's the bride?

869
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:36,711
Oh, I believe
she's still dressing.

870
01:14:36,794 --> 01:14:38,713
Are you ready?

871
01:14:40,172 --> 01:14:44,385
Oh, the Captain.
It's all too big. Nothing fits! Look!

872
01:14:44,468 --> 01:14:46,887
You're losing weight.
You've been dieting too much.

873
01:14:46,971 --> 01:14:49,265
Let's get on with it.

874
01:14:49,348 --> 01:14:52,768
Countess, bridegroom.

875
01:14:52,852 --> 01:14:55,855
Mr Harvey, you're the best man.
Mr Ogden, the witness.

876
01:14:55,938 --> 01:14:58,107
We'll fill out the forms later.

877
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:00,109
Now then.

878
01:15:00,192 --> 01:15:03,362
Do you, Henry Lewisham
Arthur Hudson...

879
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:06,198
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife...

880
01:15:06,282 --> 01:15:08,701
till death do you part?

881
01:15:08,784 --> 01:15:11,203
Oh! Oh!

882
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:14,415
- Well, he's just over-excited.
- Water!

883
01:15:19,628 --> 01:15:22,548
Hudson, whatever
made you faint?

884
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:26,051
I suppose it was the excitement
of those drastic words.

885
01:15:26,135 --> 01:15:29,054
- Drastic?
- "Till death do us part."

886
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:33,058
- That's no reflection on you, madam.
- Now what's going to happen?

887
01:15:33,142 --> 01:15:35,561
That's what I would like to know.

888
01:15:35,644 --> 01:15:38,397
Nothing's going to happen.
You'll retire as usual.

889
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,483
Hudson will sleep in the same room,
but in the other bed of course.

890
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:46,071
- I hope so.
- The other bed. The one near the door.

891
01:15:46,154 --> 01:15:48,740
Just not to obfuscate matters.

892
01:15:50,367 --> 01:15:53,370
Listen, this marriage
is just a formality.

893
01:15:53,453 --> 01:15:58,542
- The moment we get ashore, I want
a divorce. - Whatever your desire is.

894
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:02,045
I am always at your service.

895
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:05,716
Hudson, don't let
the champagne go to your head.

896
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:09,052
- Better go to bed.
- Very well, sir. Goodnight, Mr Ogden.

897
01:16:09,136 --> 01:16:11,555
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mr Harvey.

898
01:16:11,638 --> 01:16:16,226
Madam, I presume
I'll see you later.

899
01:16:17,978 --> 01:16:21,731
Where are you going?
There's the bedroom.

900
01:16:27,654 --> 01:16:30,323
The whole thing is an awful mess.

901
01:16:30,407 --> 01:16:34,744
- This is Harvey's idea.
- Why can't I sleep on the sofa?

902
01:16:34,828 --> 01:16:38,415
- Natascha, let's don't go into all
that again. - Where do you sleep?

903
01:16:38,498 --> 01:16:41,418
I have to sit up and explain
the situation to Martha.

904
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:43,920
Why don't you have the Captain explain?

905
01:16:44,003 --> 01:16:45,755
He's gone ashore.

906
01:16:45,839 --> 01:16:49,175
If Martha finds you here without
an explanation, it's gonna create scandal.

907
01:16:49,259 --> 01:16:52,137
I hate to interrupt. But I think
Martha just drove up in a Cadillac.

908
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:56,516
- Natascha, please go to bed!
- How can I with that man?

909
01:17:06,025 --> 01:17:08,444
There's no lock on this door.

910
01:17:11,197 --> 01:17:15,284
- That man is crazy.
- Oh, Natascha, please go to bed.

911
01:17:15,368 --> 01:17:19,080
To think of having to do all this
to get a passport. Huh!

912
01:17:27,338 --> 01:17:29,257
- Ice water, sir.
- Oh.

913
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:34,303
- I'll check to see if Martha's
arrived yet. - Okay.

914
01:18:01,163 --> 01:18:03,082
Goodnight.

915
01:18:12,174 --> 01:18:14,260
Oh!

916
01:18:14,343 --> 01:18:17,805
In the excitement,
I forgot to brush my teeth.

917
01:18:50,963 --> 01:18:52,422
Boo!

918
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,210
Goodnight.

919
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,578
Aah!

920
01:20:35,858 --> 01:20:38,110
Hudson, find me some pyjamas.

921
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:43,282
Oh, you've got mine on.
Find me something to sleep in.

922
01:20:43,366 --> 01:20:47,119
- Hasn't she arrived yet?
- No, not yet. Expected momentarily.

923
01:20:47,203 --> 01:20:50,456
- I'm so nervous.
- Natascha, don't worry.

924
01:20:50,539 --> 01:20:55,211
Please, don't worry. Everything will
work out the minute we get you ashore.

925
01:20:55,294 --> 01:20:59,298
- Do you require a valise, sir?
- No, I'll take them.

926
01:20:59,382 --> 01:21:01,300
Thank you.

927
01:21:02,551 --> 01:21:04,970
- Now, trust me.
- Hmm.

928
01:21:08,891 --> 01:21:11,310
- Goodnight, Hudson.
- Goodnight, sir.

929
01:21:17,024 --> 01:21:18,943
It's Harvey!

930
01:21:21,403 --> 01:21:25,824
I just heard from Martha. She won't
be coming aboard till 12.00 tomorrow.

931
01:21:28,911 --> 01:21:31,288
Goodnight, Harv.

932
01:21:33,082 --> 01:21:38,337
- Hudson, in the other room.
I'm sleeping here tonight. - Oh.

933
01:21:40,255 --> 01:21:42,674
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight.

934
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,682
Oh! Oh.

935
01:21:56,355 --> 01:21:58,398
May I come in?

936
01:21:58,482 --> 01:22:01,151
Excuse me. My medicine.

937
01:22:40,482 --> 01:22:44,027
Mr Hudson?

938
01:23:00,877 --> 01:23:03,463
Mr Hudson, your tea.

939
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:06,799
- Oh! Wait a moment!
- Oh!

940
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:13,139
Good morning, sir.
Congratulations.

941
01:23:13,223 --> 01:23:15,141
Huh.

942
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:21,147
Good morning, madam.
Your tea.

943
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:23,149
Mmm.

944
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:28,488
- Would you like to order breakfast, sir?
- Hmm?

945
01:23:28,571 --> 01:23:30,990
Oh.

946
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:35,995
I think I'll have the oatmeal porridge,
the English pork sausages...

947
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,540
Oh, pardon me, madam.
What would you like for breakfast?

948
01:23:39,624 --> 01:23:41,834
Eggs and bacon,
toast and coffee.

949
01:23:41,918 --> 01:23:45,046
Eggs and bacon,
toast and coffee.

950
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:02,855
I hate to disturb you,
but there's a little trouble...

951
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:05,358
about Mrs Hudson's papers
having been blown overboard.

952
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:08,778
They say the marriage isn't legal unless
she produces her identification papers.

953
01:24:08,861 --> 01:24:11,572
What do they expect the
lady to do, jump in the

954
01:24:11,572 --> 01:24:14,450
middle of the Pacific
Ocean to recover her papers?

955
01:24:14,533 --> 01:24:17,495
Unfortunately, there's a
report that a lady stowaway

956
01:24:17,495 --> 01:24:20,206
is aboard, and they're
taking every precaution.

957
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:23,626
What's a stowaway got to do with it?
All that's involved is a marriage.

958
01:24:23,709 --> 01:24:26,128
You were witness to that.
You married them.

959
01:24:26,212 --> 01:24:28,589
Nevertheless, they want
to see the lady's passport.

960
01:24:28,672 --> 01:24:31,342
She doesn't need a passport
to go ashore in Honolulu.

961
01:24:31,425 --> 01:24:34,136
She's married to an American citizen.

962
01:24:34,219 --> 01:24:37,264
Quite so. But if her papers
of identification are missing...

963
01:24:37,348 --> 01:24:39,975
then a marriage at sea
is not recognized.

964
01:24:40,059 --> 01:24:43,062
She's an alien and will have to go
before an Immigration board of enquiry.

965
01:24:43,145 --> 01:24:46,982
The purser's asked to see you, sir.

966
01:24:47,066 --> 01:24:52,321
Yes, of course. I'll see him right away.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

967
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:58,911
It's time for me to disappear.

968
01:24:58,994 --> 01:25:02,080
Why? The Captain married you,
and that's a legal fact.

969
01:25:02,164 --> 01:25:07,586
- But the marriage has not yet been
consummated, sir. - Yet? Hmph.

970
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:10,422
Hudson, your mind
is running in another channel.

971
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,592
The important thing is the papers.

972
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,969
What are you gonna tell them
about the papers?

973
01:25:16,053 --> 01:25:18,597
Mr Ogden didn't tell me
anything about papers.

974
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,934
Her identification papers,
her birth certificate, her passport!

975
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:26,104
We've been all through that with you.
What are you gonna tell them?

976
01:25:26,188 --> 01:25:29,941
- Oh, that. I shall tell them the truth,
as you told me. - As I told you?

977
01:25:30,025 --> 01:25:32,611
As you told me to tell it.

978
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:37,115
I didn't tell you anything.
You remember that. Go ahead.

979
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,577
I can only tell them
how I met my first wife.

980
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,079
How you first met
your wife. Oh!

981
01:25:43,163 --> 01:25:46,958
It was a breezy afternoon.
I was walking on the top deck...

982
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:50,503
and there she was, holding
down some papers in her lap.

983
01:25:50,587 --> 01:25:53,882
- It was love at first sight.
- Ugh!

984
01:25:53,965 --> 01:25:57,427
- Hurry up and get to the point, Hudson.
- Yes, sir.

985
01:25:57,510 --> 01:26:01,931
Suddenly, there was a gust of wind,
and the papers blew overboard.

986
01:26:02,015 --> 01:26:05,059
Hudson, you have literary talent.

987
01:26:10,523 --> 01:26:13,818
We better go, Mr Hudson.
The Immigration officials are waiting.

988
01:26:17,197 --> 01:26:20,450
No, now wait Just one moment.
I think I should go with Hudson.

989
01:26:20,533 --> 01:26:23,620
An excellent idea.
Your presence will be efficacious.

990
01:26:23,703 --> 01:26:28,166
- Would you like me to go along?
- No, stay here and look after Natascha.

991
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,836
Don't worry.

992
01:26:31,919 --> 01:26:34,339
Mr Mears, I think we better go.

993
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,384
Come along, Hudson.

994
01:26:41,053 --> 01:26:45,308
- Harvey, you remember what
I told you about Honolulu?

995
01:26:45,391 --> 01:26:48,144
- You're not going to dive off the boat?
- Now is the time.

996
01:26:48,227 --> 01:26:51,105
While they're questioning Hudson.

997
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:10,791
Oh!

998
01:27:16,672 --> 01:27:20,092
- I'll see you on the beach at Waikiki.
- Mm-hmm.

999
01:27:20,176 --> 01:27:24,930
- If I'm far off, jump up and down,
then I'll recognize you. - Mm.

1000
01:27:25,014 --> 01:27:28,058
So if I make it,
I'll see you later.

1001
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:33,647
Hmm. Here's another one.

1002
01:27:36,483 --> 01:27:38,360
If you make it?

1003
01:27:38,444 --> 01:27:41,322
Wait a minute!
What do you mean, "If you make it"?

1004
01:27:41,405 --> 01:27:42,906
- I'm scared.
- What?

1005
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:44,992
And here goes.

1006
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:56,003
What's going on out there?

1007
01:27:56,086 --> 01:27:58,422
That's a Hawaiian
diving off the boat.

1008
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:03,927
Now, Mr Hudson,
we'd like to see your wife.

1009
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:06,680
I believe she's taking a bath.

1010
01:28:16,356 --> 01:28:18,775
Oh, my. How nice.

1011
01:28:20,861 --> 01:28:24,114
Maria, qu'avez vous fait
de nos bagages?

1012
01:28:24,197 --> 01:28:27,284
J'en ai gard quartre et je vais renvoyer
le reste par I'American Express.

1013
01:28:27,367 --> 01:28:29,786
- Comme vous me I'avez demand.
- C'est bon.

1014
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:33,457
- Est-ce que c'est votre suite?
- Je crois.

1015
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:37,627
- Ah, Martha!
- Hello, Harvey.

1016
01:28:37,711 --> 01:28:40,463
- Oh, what comfortable quarters you have.
- Oh, yes.

1017
01:28:40,547 --> 01:28:43,466
Lovely. Where's Ogden?

1018
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:46,303
Uh, he's up in the lounge
with Hudson.

1019
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:48,805
You know, Hudson's married now.

1020
01:28:48,889 --> 01:28:51,766
Hudson married?
Oh, really? That's odd.

1021
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:55,395
Yes. Ah, well,
the Captain married them.

1022
01:28:55,478 --> 01:28:58,565
- Can I get you something?
- No, it's much too early.

1023
01:29:01,985 --> 01:29:04,404
Captain, this is
Mrs Ogden Mears.

1024
01:29:04,487 --> 01:29:08,408
- How do you do? Pardon me.
- How do you do?

1025
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:11,077
- We're still waiting for Mrs Hudson.
- She's taking a bath.

1026
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:13,913
She should be finished.
I'll go and see.

1027
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,918
Well.

1028
01:29:23,339 --> 01:29:25,884
Can I get you something, Captain?

1029
01:29:25,967 --> 01:29:28,761
- No, thanks. But if you don't
mind my waiting. - Quite all right.

1030
01:29:40,523 --> 01:29:42,942
- Hello, Martha.
- Hello, Ogden.

1031
01:29:45,695 --> 01:29:48,614
Well, you've met the Captain.

1032
01:29:48,698 --> 01:29:51,451
- Yes, of course.
- We're looking for Mrs Hudson.

1033
01:29:51,534 --> 01:29:54,704
The Immigration officers are in the lounge
and I don't like to keep them waiting.

1034
01:29:54,787 --> 01:29:58,708
- Not in the bathroom. I looked all over.
- It's very serious.

1035
01:29:58,791 --> 01:30:03,212
Without her identification papers,
she can't land anywhere. She doesn't exist.

1036
01:30:03,296 --> 01:30:08,884
- If she doesn't exist, there's no problem.
- I think we should look for her.

1037
01:30:08,968 --> 01:30:12,221
It might be a good idea if you had
another look in the bathroom.

1038
01:30:12,305 --> 01:30:15,891
Martha, would you excuse us
for a moment?

1039
01:30:15,975 --> 01:30:17,935
All right, Captain.

1040
01:30:24,483 --> 01:30:26,444
Hey!

1041
01:30:28,821 --> 01:30:31,407
- Waikiki?
- Hop in the back, sister.

1042
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:33,450
Thank you!

1043
01:30:46,839 --> 01:30:50,843
Whew! That's the strangest thing
I've ever known.

1044
01:30:50,926 --> 01:30:52,845
She's disappeared.

1045
01:30:57,307 --> 01:30:59,601
I think we better search
the entire boat.

1046
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,279
Good morning, madam.

1047
01:31:10,362 --> 01:31:13,115
Congratulations, Hudson.
I hear you're married now.

1048
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:15,367
Well, in a way, yes.

1049
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,536
Hudson, what do you mean?

1050
01:31:17,619 --> 01:31:21,248
The marriage has not yet
been consummated.

1051
01:31:21,331 --> 01:31:24,626
- What is she, an American?
- No, madam, she is from Hong Kong.

1052
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:27,963
- Chinese?
- I shouldn't think so, madam.

1053
01:31:28,046 --> 01:31:30,132
She is a Russian emigr.

1054
01:31:30,215 --> 01:31:35,178
- Well, I should like to meet her.
- I'll do my best, madam.

1055
01:31:36,304 --> 01:31:38,223
Well.

1056
01:31:38,306 --> 01:31:41,810
Hudson, it seems as though
your wife has disappeared.

1057
01:31:41,893 --> 01:31:44,813
Oh, that's awful.
Poor Hudson.

1058
01:31:44,896 --> 01:31:49,234
- I was beginning to grow very fond of her.
- What have you done to the lady?

1059
01:31:49,317 --> 01:31:52,571
Oh, nothing, madam.
The marriage was never consummated.

1060
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:55,240
You've got "consummated"
on the brain.

1061
01:31:57,033 --> 01:31:59,452
I think I'll go ashore
and do someshopping.

1062
01:31:59,452 --> 01:32:01,371
I think I'll go with you, Harvey.

1063
01:32:01,454 --> 01:32:03,331
Don't go yet, Ogden.

1064
01:32:03,415 --> 01:32:06,042
I've just ordered lunch, and there's one
or two things I'd like to discuss with you.

1065
01:32:06,126 --> 01:32:09,337
I'll stay and have something with you.
What has madam ordered?

1066
01:32:09,421 --> 01:32:11,631
- A consummated soup, sir.
- What's that?

1067
01:32:11,715 --> 01:32:14,134
Consomm, sir.

1068
01:32:14,217 --> 01:32:17,804
- Cold chicken, asparagus and a
bottle of Chablis. - I'll have the same.

1069
01:32:17,887 --> 01:32:22,642
- I'll see you both later.
- The Waikiki Hotel at 5.30 for cocktails.

1070
01:32:22,725 --> 01:32:24,644
Uh, you may go, Hudson.

1071
01:32:27,939 --> 01:32:33,152
- Did you hear from Washington?
- I got this letter this morning.

1072
01:32:33,236 --> 01:32:35,154
Here's the substance of it:

1073
01:32:35,238 --> 01:32:39,075
"To allay rumours of divorce, Martha and
you should return to the States together.

1074
01:32:39,158 --> 01:32:43,997
I advise this because of my great
affection for you both." Etc., etc., etc.

1075
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,040
So.

1076
01:32:46,124 --> 01:32:49,919
If this arrangement
doesn't work out...

1077
01:32:50,002 --> 01:32:52,380
how will it affect
my divorce settlement?

1078
01:32:52,463 --> 01:32:55,133
You can put that in escrow.

1079
01:32:55,216 --> 01:32:59,846
Unfortunately, the only interest I have
is money, having had no children.

1080
01:32:59,929 --> 01:33:02,682
- Am I to blame for that?
- No.

1081
01:33:02,765 --> 01:33:05,268
No, neither one of us is to blame.

1082
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:08,145
The desire for happiness
fooled us both.

1083
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:10,398
Happiness, eh?

1084
01:33:11,691 --> 01:33:14,443
I was going to say "love"...

1085
01:33:14,527 --> 01:33:18,072
but I don't think either one of us
knows what the word means.

1086
01:33:18,155 --> 01:33:21,826
In any case, what are you
gonna do about Washington?

1087
01:33:21,909 --> 01:33:24,620
Well...

1088
01:33:24,704 --> 01:33:28,666
I don't look forward to spending
the rest of my life in Saudi Arabia.

1089
01:33:33,838 --> 01:33:37,633
She has long, dark hair,
wears a sarong...

1090
01:33:37,716 --> 01:33:39,635
and looks like a Hawaiian.

1091
01:33:39,718 --> 01:33:42,721
A lot of dames look
like that around here.

1092
01:33:42,805 --> 01:33:45,307
She said she'd meet me
on the beach at Waikiki.

1093
01:33:45,391 --> 01:33:49,478
- I think she's kidding you.
- Maybe.

1094
01:33:49,561 --> 01:33:54,525
- Where's the beach at Waikiki?
- That's the Waikiki Hotel.

1095
01:34:12,376 --> 01:34:15,128
- Can I check this suitcase, please?
- Certainly, sir.

1096
01:34:15,212 --> 01:34:17,631
- What name?
- Harvey Crothers.

1097
01:34:17,714 --> 01:34:20,467
Check Mr Crothers' case
into the cloakroom.

1098
01:34:20,551 --> 01:34:24,805
- Is the Waikiki Beach near here?
- It's just outside, sir.

1099
01:34:24,888 --> 01:34:26,807
That's strange.

1100
01:34:44,908 --> 01:34:46,827
I can't stop!

1101
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:50,330
Oh! All this jumping up and down
is like running ten miles.

1102
01:34:50,413 --> 01:34:53,333
It's so good
to see you again.

1103
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:56,336
Let's sit down.

1104
01:34:59,965 --> 01:35:02,384
I didn't think I'd see you again
after that dive. It was perfect.

1105
01:35:02,467 --> 01:35:05,971
- What's happening on the boat? - They're
still waiting for you in the lounge.

1106
01:35:06,054 --> 01:35:08,598
- And Ogden?
- He's with his wife.

1107
01:35:10,183 --> 01:35:12,102
Yes.

1108
01:35:12,185 --> 01:35:15,355
I bought you some clothes.
Oh, I know the other ones were too big.

1109
01:35:15,438 --> 01:35:19,192
These are smaller. There's a place
You can change next to the pool.

1110
01:35:19,275 --> 01:35:21,277
Meanwhile, I'll book you a room
at the hotel.

1111
01:35:21,361 --> 01:35:24,447
- They might be looking for Mrs Hudson.
- Not a chance.

1112
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:26,449
I'll book them under my name.

1113
01:35:26,533 --> 01:35:29,452
For the time being,
you're Mrs Harvey Crothers.

1114
01:35:31,871 --> 01:35:33,957
- Remember me?
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,960
- I'd like an outside suite.
- Certainly. For yourself?

1116
01:35:37,043 --> 01:35:40,046
- For my wife. I'm leaving for the
mainland. - Very well.

1117
01:35:40,129 --> 01:35:43,549
- Do you wish to see the rooms now?
- No, I'll wait for my wife.

1118
01:35:43,633 --> 01:35:45,969
- Fine.
- Well, here she...

1119
01:35:46,052 --> 01:35:49,806
- Well!
- It doesn't fit. This is too tight.

1120
01:35:51,057 --> 01:35:54,894
I can't breathe.

1121
01:35:54,977 --> 01:35:56,896
You dropped your change.

1122
01:35:56,979 --> 01:35:59,941
Will you sign the register,
Mrs Crothers?

1123
01:36:01,484 --> 01:36:05,238
- C-R-O...
- T-H...

1124
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,079
She's not here.

1125
01:36:13,162 --> 01:36:16,123
- Let's have some tea.
- Yeah.

1126
01:36:20,753 --> 01:36:22,838
Ah, there he is.

1127
01:36:24,548 --> 01:36:28,594
I'm sorry I'm late. I had to leave
Ogden with the Immigration authorities.

1128
01:36:28,678 --> 01:36:31,931
- It seems they're still looking
for Hudson's wife. - Ah, yes.

1129
01:36:32,014 --> 01:36:34,266
There she is.

1130
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:37,269
Hudson, you haven't been
drinking before lunch?

1131
01:36:37,353 --> 01:36:40,189
The poor man is so distressed
since his wife went away.

1132
01:36:40,272 --> 01:36:43,442
That's the third person
he's mistaken for his wife.

1133
01:36:43,526 --> 01:36:47,112
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Martha, this is my wife, Mrs Crothers.

1134
01:36:47,196 --> 01:36:51,116
- Mrs Ogden Mears.
- How do you do?

1135
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,410
How do you do?

1136
01:36:57,539 --> 01:37:00,417
You know, Harvey is so secretive.

1137
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:03,420
He never told me a word
about his marriage.

1138
01:37:03,504 --> 01:37:07,424
Well, there's not much to tell.
We haven't been married long.

1139
01:37:07,508 --> 01:37:09,426
Have we?

1140
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:11,929
As soon as something develops,
we'll let you know.

1141
01:37:13,013 --> 01:37:15,265
No, I mean,
when did you marry?

1142
01:37:15,349 --> 01:37:18,602
Ah-ha-ha!
That's the secret.

1143
01:37:18,685 --> 01:37:21,605
However, you must bring
your wife to Arabia...

1144
01:37:21,688 --> 01:37:24,775
once we've refurbished
the Embassy, but not before...

1145
01:37:24,858 --> 01:37:27,277
otherwise you'll have to sleep
in a tent like the rest of us.

1146
01:37:30,197 --> 01:37:33,951
- That depends with whom you share it.
- Hmm.

1147
01:37:34,034 --> 01:37:37,120
- Martha, would you like to dance?
- I'd love it.

1148
01:37:37,204 --> 01:37:40,624
It'll give me a chance to give
some advice to the lovelorn.

1149
01:37:54,012 --> 01:37:56,932
This is the first chance I've had
to speak to you alone.

1150
01:37:58,934 --> 01:38:03,313
There's very little time,
and I've a lot to tell you.

1151
01:38:03,396 --> 01:38:06,316
Harvey will be staying behind,
so I'll be in touch with you through him.

1152
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:08,818
He'll be working on
a passport for you.

1153
01:38:08,902 --> 01:38:10,820
Martha's coming with me.

1154
01:38:10,904 --> 01:38:13,823
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

1155
01:38:16,618 --> 01:38:20,538
I got a letter from Washington saying
that Martha should go with me...

1156
01:38:20,622 --> 01:38:22,874
to Saudi Arabia
for appearances' sake.

1157
01:38:22,957 --> 01:38:24,918
Of course.

1158
01:38:26,461 --> 01:38:29,005
Please try to understand.

1159
01:38:29,089 --> 01:38:31,049
Of course.

1160
01:38:33,301 --> 01:38:35,220
For appearances' sake.

1161
01:38:35,303 --> 01:38:40,225
For the esteem of people
I don't give a damn about.

1162
01:38:40,308 --> 01:38:44,229
If I had the guts,
I'd rid myself of the whole thing:

1163
01:38:44,312 --> 01:38:47,565
Washington, Saudi Arabia and everything.

1164
01:38:47,649 --> 01:38:49,859
You can't do that.

1165
01:39:03,623 --> 01:39:06,876
Be careful.
We're being watched.

1166
01:39:06,959 --> 01:39:09,378
The legal eye is upon us.

1167
01:39:11,631 --> 01:39:16,886
You must believe me when I tell you this
is the first real happiness I've known.

1168
01:39:16,969 --> 01:39:19,138
I love you very much.

1169
01:39:21,224 --> 01:39:24,602
- Your wife looks sad.
- You think so?

1170
01:39:24,685 --> 01:39:27,897
What nonsense.
She's not your wife.

1171
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:32,401
- Martha, you're being silly!
- Not as silly as you think.

1172
01:39:32,485 --> 01:39:36,614
I've been talking to someone
who knew her in Hong Kong.

1173
01:39:36,697 --> 01:39:40,284
The boat passes here at 11.00.

1174
01:39:40,367 --> 01:39:44,121
I'll be on deck imagining that
you're sitting here at this table.

1175
01:39:44,205 --> 01:39:46,165
Let's dance.

1176
01:39:47,208 --> 01:39:49,960
I can't.

1177
01:39:50,044 --> 01:39:53,672
I must go to my room
before your wife returns.

1178
01:39:53,756 --> 01:39:58,385
I can't say goodbye.
I can't trust myself.

1179
01:40:00,804 --> 01:40:02,848
Will you excuse me?

1180
01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:12,608
Well, goodbye.
Harvey will take care of everything.

1181
01:40:12,691 --> 01:40:15,110
All right. Thank you.

1182
01:40:23,243 --> 01:40:26,079
What's happened to Mrs Crothers?

1183
01:40:26,163 --> 01:40:29,249
She had a splitting headache
and asked to be excused.

1184
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:31,919
- She won't be seeing us off?
- I don't think so.

1185
01:40:32,002 --> 01:40:36,256
- She's going straight to bed.
- Can't we go and see her for a moment?

1186
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:39,259
- It'll be best to let her rest quietly.
- Pardon me, madam.

1187
01:40:39,343 --> 01:40:42,929
- It's time to leave for the boat.
- Oh, so soon?

1188
01:40:43,513 --> 01:40:45,432
Well.

1189
01:40:51,688 --> 01:40:56,318
Hudson, I will need these three closets
and Mr Mears can have the end one.

1190
01:40:56,401 --> 01:40:58,320
Very well, madam.

1191
01:41:02,282 --> 01:41:05,285
Your big trunks
I'm having put in the hold...

1192
01:41:05,368 --> 01:41:08,121
so there'll be more room
for madam's wardrobe.

1193
01:41:08,205 --> 01:41:10,123
Okay, Hudson.

1194
01:41:33,563 --> 01:41:35,482
Voil.

1195
01:41:39,903 --> 01:41:43,823
- Hudson, have you found your wife yet?
- Not yet, madam.

1196
01:41:43,907 --> 01:41:46,326
Surely you're not going
to leave without her.

1197
01:41:46,409 --> 01:41:51,331
Whatever happens, I shall deport myself
as a husband and a gentleman.

1198
01:41:52,582 --> 01:41:54,500
Maria.

1199
01:41:56,002 --> 01:41:58,629
Oh! What's this?

1200
01:42:01,341 --> 01:42:04,594
Hudson, does this
belong to your wife?

1201
01:42:04,677 --> 01:42:08,514
I haven't the faintest idea.
We haven't been married that long.

1202
01:42:08,598 --> 01:42:10,516
Oh!

1203
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:15,146
Perhaps you might know something
about this, Your Excellency.

1204
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:20,651
It looks like a two-ring circus.

1205
01:42:23,529 --> 01:42:28,117
Ogden, you must be losing
your sense of propriety.

1206
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,454
You not only humiliate me
in front of people...

1207
01:42:31,537 --> 01:42:34,707
but you insult my
intelligence by introducing

1208
01:42:34,707 --> 01:42:37,293
that woman as Mrs Harvey Crothers...

1209
01:42:37,376 --> 01:42:41,881
and then again as Mrs Hudson
when she's sleeping here in your cabin.

1210
01:42:43,632 --> 01:42:46,969
As Ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
it is not exactly comme il faut...

1211
01:42:47,052 --> 01:42:50,639
to include in your entourage,
the mistress of a gangster.

1212
01:42:50,723 --> 01:42:52,641
A prostitute.

1213
01:42:54,685 --> 01:42:58,480
I wonder what your fate would have
been in similar circumstances.

1214
01:43:41,732 --> 01:43:43,609
Hello.

1215
01:43:43,692 --> 01:43:46,987
- Hello, Harvey? Ogden.
- Haven't you left yet?

1216
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:50,115
- No, I got off with the pilot boat.
- What happened?

1217
01:43:50,198 --> 01:43:52,617
I don't know.
I just couldn't take it.

1218
01:43:52,701 --> 01:43:55,245
Aren't you going to Washington?
What about your career?

1219
01:43:55,328 --> 01:43:57,247
I'd rather be happy
than president.

1220
01:43:57,330 --> 01:43:59,666
Listen, where is everybody?

1221
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:04,463
- You know who, your wife.
- I think you mean my wife.

1222
01:44:04,546 --> 01:44:07,257
Hudson's giving me
an argument here.

1223
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:09,759
She came down
to the cabaret after you left...

1224
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:12,345
and she's been by the window,
looking out at the sea ever since.

1225
01:44:12,429 --> 01:44:15,599
- Did you tell her the news? - I told
her there was nothing to worry about.

1226
01:44:15,682 --> 01:44:18,101
The Immigration people have
given her the benefit of the doubt.

1227
01:44:18,184 --> 01:44:20,937
She's now Hudson's wife,
married to an American citizen.

1228
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:23,982
Listen, don't tell her I'm here.
I want to surprise her.

1229
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:34,117
Ogden!

1230
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:37,287
- Well, buddy, I hope you're doing the
right thing. - Where is she?

1231
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:39,998
Right where you left her,
sitting by the window.

1232
01:44:48,756 --> 01:44:50,675
Yes, sir?

1233
01:44:50,758 --> 01:44:53,803
I'm looking for a young lady. I believe
she's sitting alone by the window.

1234
01:44:53,887 --> 01:44:55,847
Yes, sir.

1235
01:45:25,918 --> 01:45:27,837
Ogden!

1236
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,299
See, you can't get rid of me.

1237
01:45:31,382 --> 01:45:33,509
May I have this dance?
