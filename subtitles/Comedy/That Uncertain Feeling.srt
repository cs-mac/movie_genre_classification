1
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:58,665
Men have been
justly considered...

2
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,465
Ios... masters of the world.

3
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:03,463
Men have dominated
to wild animals.

4
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,186
Men have penetrated the
depths of the jungle...

5
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:10,265
And able to investigate the Moon
and planets...

6
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,511
But it still exists... a...

7
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:14,791
Where no man... has set foot.

8
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,666
A place that even have seen.

9
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:24,035
Ladies' room.

10
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:43,161
How are you, honey? It happened.

11
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,367
It comes and goes.
What a bummer.

12
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:46,930
Believe me, it does not matter.

13
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,489
However, I get very nervous.

14
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,840
The doctor told me that I should not
worry about it.

15
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,120
I would be worried. Dr. Vengard.

16
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:55,406
Dr. Vengard
is the doctor you need.

17
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,250
I'm not willing to allow
I psychoanalyzed.

18
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,877
Come on, Jill, you should forget
prejudice.

19
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:02,528
I am a totally normal.

20
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:04,844
Lord, how boring!
Darling, you should not talk...

21
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:07,318
That way... even in jest.
Seriously, Jill...

22
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,843
Vengard... doctor visit. He
Molly wonders McCleaps.

23
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,317
Both suffered from claustrophobia,
I could not even climb...

24
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,161
In an elevator.
Can you imagine...

25
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:17,127
What that means...
living in an attic?

26
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:19,484
Did Dr. Vengard the cured?
I suppose so.

27
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:22,321
I read the other day that he escaped
a very handsome elevator.

28
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:24,207
- Molly McCleaps?
- Yes.

29
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:31,480
- I'm Mrs. Baker.
- I know.

30
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,599
My name is Mrs. Colling. Sit.

31
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:41,276
Lady...

32
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:42,883
Baker.

33
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:44,880
- Is your first name?
- Jill.

34
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:47,006
Jill Baker.

35
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:50,877
685 Park Avenue.
- 685...

36
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:53,080
Park Avenue.

37
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,795
Does your age, Mrs. Baker?

38
00:02:57,207 --> 00:02:58,207
22.

39
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,479
I'm your doctor, Mrs. Baker.

40
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,366
24.

41
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:07,675
Thank you.

42
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,596
Doctor, I want to be honest.

43
00:03:13,597 --> 00:03:15,882
I am convinced
that nothing's wrong.

44
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,886
There will be a change of heart
when I get out of this consultation.

45
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:24,079
You see, people do not know anything
of itself. Nothing.

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,362
His true personality
is to them unknown.

47
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:31,279
What I intend is
introduce you to your inner self.

48
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,275
I want you to know.

49
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,881
- Would you like to know?
- No.

50
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,676
I'm a little shy.
Well, what happens?

51
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:44,120
Well, it is difficult to show
symptoms because...

52
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:46,915
Is something that comes and goes.

53
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:51,359
It comes and goes.

54
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,718
Yes. It is so absurd.

55
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,077
It's always the same thing
when I go to the doctor.

56
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:59,080
When I go, it goes.

57
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,722
And when I leave, come.

58
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:04,079
Mrs. Baker, that it is lo
that comes and goes...

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,677
You have it... quite concerned.

60
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,913
So dispense
all kinds of inhibition...

61
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:12,075
And see your inner self
and talk freely.

62
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:14,959
What is it you come and go?

63
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:16,556
Hiccups.

64
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:18,079
Does the hiccups?

65
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,320
Yes, when I get nervous
or irritated, I have hiccups.

66
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:25,758
It's pretty nasty
and sometimes very uncomfortable.

67
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,069
Naturally it is soon
to make a diagnosis...

68
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,639
But apparently...
gets the hiccups...

69
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:31,241
Nervous reaction... for some.

70
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:33,391
We will see what causes
that reaction.

71
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:34,879
- It seems reasonable.
- Good.

72
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,354
Do you want to follow me, please?

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,592
Aha. There is nothing to
of his childhood.

74
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,072
We will examine your current life.

75
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:52,071
The'll look through
a magnifying glass.

76
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,275
We will study every detail.

77
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,988
Mrs. Baker...

78
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,157
- Are you married?
- Yes.

79
00:04:58,158 --> 00:04:59,870
When did you marry? At 19 years.

80
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,471
How old Ileva married?
- 6.

81
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:02,912
- With the same husband?
- Yes.

82
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:04,796
- Aha.
- Doctor, believe me...

83
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:06,311
I have no problems...
in my marriage.

84
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,549
Across Park Avenue not
find a couple...

85
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,747
- Happier.
- Sorry...

86
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:12,268
But it is my duty... explore
all paths.

87
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,706
Included Park Avenue.

88
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:15,788
How old is your husband?
- 35.

89
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:17,391
Does your profession?
He is vice president...

90
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:19,077
Of an insurance company,
but do you want to leave...

91
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:21,468
My marriage alone?
All right, calm down.

92
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:24,955
Talk about something else.
Do you have headaches?

93
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,155
No. Do you have a good appetite?

94
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:28,194
Yes.

95
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,191
How is your sleeping?

96
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,958
Not so good.

97
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:34,951
What about your husband, what about sleep?
Very good.

98
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:39,270
Well, think
one of those nights...

99
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,189
In which... has been unveiled.

100
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:43,274
When he looks to his right,
What do you see?

101
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,669
My dresser.
And when you look to your left?

102
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,711
To my husband.

103
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:49,315
- Sleeping?
- Yes.

104
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,547
Do you mean undo my marriage?

105
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:52,986
No.

106
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:54,515
Soio wake her husband.

107
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:56,868
Thanks, that's all for today.

108
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:59,748
Doctor, my husband is
nothing to do with my insomnia.

109
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:01,668
I am extremely sensitive
to noise.

110
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:04,667
The slightest noise.
Does your husband snores?

111
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,474
No. But I have to admit
breathe a little stronger.

112
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:09,751
Do not tell me?
I believe I can object...

113
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:12,144
Nothing to that.
The poor have to breathe.

114
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:15,033
I guess so. Well, Mrs. Baker...

115
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:16,708
Ease... her husband sleeping...

116
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,985
Is a challenge for you.
It's a bit like...

117
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,669
Well, have you ever
has followed a regime?

118
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,985
Yes, once, of vegetables.
What would have been...

119
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:28,351
If someone had eaten
beside a huge steak?

120
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,872
- How chips?
- Yes.

121
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:32,593
That was my husband.
And was not nervous?

122
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:33,743
No.

123
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:37,589
But now that lo mentioned,
itself was a bit irritating.

124
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,790
And little considered.
Certainly.

125
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,148
Husbands want their
Women hold the line...

126
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:43,508
But instead...
I would say it is a...

127
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,589
Total lack of cooperation.
Indeed.

128
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:58,863
- Jill, dear.
- Hi, Margie.

129
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,427
I have not heard from you.

130
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,470
- How are you?
- Very good.

131
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:04,383
- Did you see him?
- Margie...

132
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:06,662
You should not send me to see
Dr. Vengard.

133
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,508
Have you gone back?
No, I will not.

134
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,542
It will not destroy my marriage.
Between Larry and I...

135
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:12,668
There is no problem.
So I told myself.

136
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,062
Anybody? Talked about us?
Do not dare...

137
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:17,752
In my presence. Know
you and I are friends...

138
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:20,584
And that I defend. I know, dear.

139
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,468
Defend?? Against what?
Come on...

140
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:24,666
Tommy & Country will...
proclaimed the happy couple.

141
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,139
That always arouses envy.
Many friends...

142
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,062
Have been married...
for 6 years.

143
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,704
Why are we going to name
the happy couple?

144
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:33,344
And why not? You form
a happy couple, right?

145
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,223
Margie, lo've been fatal
últimas two weeks.

146
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,188
I'm obsessed with my marriage.

147
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,987
Watch what you look,
Io think think...

148
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:44,265
Just relating it...
with my marriage.

149
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,261
I hate the doctor Vengard!

150
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,061
However, I must confess that...

151
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:50,264
What, dear?
If you look at your husband...

152
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,868
With a magnifying glass
is inevitable...

153
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,144
You find... defective.

154
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:56,342
Yes, of course.
You see things that never...

155
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,862
You would have noticed. What?

156
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:01,222
Well, I will put a case
Io to understand.

157
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,980
The other morning...

158
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:05,617
You know that I have trouble lo
sleep? Well...

159
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,780
When I was lucky...
of poderme sleep...

160
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:10,541
Sound... what woke me up
at 8:15 o'clock?

161
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,063
- A gargle.
- A gargle?

162
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,665
The gargle reveille is...

163
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:18,103
And snoring...
the touch of endorsement.

164
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:20,621
And during the day?
At 9:00 in the morning...

165
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:21,697
My life is going.

166
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,458
Dear, is a truth as a temple.

167
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:28,104
Io I do not know to be true.
I made a mess.

168
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,260
I do not know what to think.

169
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:32,545
I had always heard
the perfect marriage...

170
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,697
Should have some mystery.

171
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:37,301
That your husband should continue
still a bit unknown.

172
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,818
Someone have relationships...

173
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,776
Every day... want to renew.
Do you understand me?

174
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:41,777
Yes, dear.

175
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,581
Hello.

176
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:48,692
- Hi, Margie.
- Hello, Larry.

177
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,264
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

178
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:53,657
How are you? Very good. Do you?

179
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,496
Right. Did you have a good day?

180
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:56,938
- Very good. Do you?
- Well.

181
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:58,742
- What's New?
- No, do you?

182
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,861
- No.
- Well, so far.

183
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:07,658
What do you think?

184
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:10,293
Well, there was nothing new
and frankly admitted lo.

185
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:13,574
- Jill!
- Yes, dear?

186
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:16,339
Do they come to dinner the Cooper?
Do not know yet, honey.

187
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,778
Io tell you about Ilamen.

188
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,338
We appreciate lo
because if they come, I'll shave.

189
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:21,862
Okay, I lo...

190
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:26,094
I do not want to take
fuel to the fire...

191
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:29,057
But we are dealing...
some very specific facts.

192
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:31,738
If they come to dinner the Cooper,
that huge and ugly...

193
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,938
Mrs. Cooper ..., shaves.

194
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,093
And if only dinner with his wife,
not shaved.

195
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:38,493
And who should shave
is Mrs. Cooper.

196
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:40,618
I spent three hours
in the beauty salon...

197
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:42,931
Deserve... and not to shave.
Darling, a problem...

198
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,017
Affecting...
95 percent of all marriages...

199
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,541
Is that husbands...
do not shave.

200
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,858
Do not they realize that the beard
is growing at 8:00?

201
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,570
Hi, honey.

202
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,854
- Larry.
- Yes, dear?

203
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,490
He's back.
Great. Have you enjoyed it?

204
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,251
- Who?
- Evans.

205
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,809
That reminds me promised
Call me as soon as I returned.

206
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,250
The company Continental will
will be offering other insurance.

207
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,450
Evans still in Bermuda.

208
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:23,895
What it has become is the hiccups.

209
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,567
Hiccups??

210
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,054
Ah!

211
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,135
Hast thou a joke, eh?

212
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:36,255
You were very funny.

213
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,849
Keeks!

214
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:44,846
Larry...

215
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:46,167
Ilegado... when you,
you asked...

216
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:47,857
If there was any news.

217
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,533
Course there is a new...

218
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,336
And something...
quite important.

219
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:53,569
Do you know who is coming
next Thursday?

220
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,216
The President
Universal Mattress...

221
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,772
President of Furniture...
United and other senior...

222
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:01,054
Of the two companies.
What a drag.

223
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:05,009
I know it will be A boring...

224
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,769
Mattresses... but Universal
Furniture and United...

225
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,610
Have merged.
Almost all insurance...

226
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,096
Will be redone.

227
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,088
The man will have
Kafka is convincing...

228
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,849
Mattress... Universal.

229
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:16,965
But I have thoroughly researched.
Is Hungarian.

230
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,854
In fact, they are all Hungarians.
So...

231
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:21,735
So let's give dinner
a hint Hungarian, huh?

232
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:23,296
Look, Larry... Listen, honey...

233
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:25,889
Do not pretend that you... view
as a gypsy, but...

234
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,455
We will look...
a cook Hungarian...

235
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,447
That will prepare...
a wonderful "goulash".

236
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:31,335
A Kafka will love.

237
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:33,727
I will get those insurance
if I have to fill...

238
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:36,457
That Hungarian... like
one of their own mattresses.

239
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,168
And to make you feel at home...

240
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:41,485
Relations chief...
Io public warned me...

241
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:43,726
Right before dinner I must say:

242
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:47,729
"E dese, and des Egue senguere.

243
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,094
Eguec senguere ".

244
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:53,445
It means health, or something.

245
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,248
"Eguec Seguera".

246
00:11:57,975 --> 00:11:59,886
It is only a detail,
but I like it.

247
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:02,522
Success in business
is 50 percent hard work...

248
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,446
And 50 a cigar.

249
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:06,206
"Eguec Seguera".

250
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:09,361
Formidable, honey! Excellent!

251
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,643
But a little more lively.
Look, you see.

252
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:14,647
"Eguec Seguera!"
"Eguec Seguera!"

253
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,525
Ah, I see. "Eguec Seguera!"

254
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:19,447
"Eguec Seguera!"
- Yes, it is.

255
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,649
Fantastic, honey. Yes.

256
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:23,327
Keeks!

257
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:28,853
Larry...

258
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:31,322
- Why do that?
- What?

259
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:32,727
"Keeks".

260
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,801
Well...

261
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,724
- I do it... always.
- Why?

262
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:40,612
The truth, I know.

263
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,247
But when you do, you
What does it mean?

264
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:46,052
Is there a hidden agenda?

265
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:51,047
I do not know, never have tried lo.
But I lo do to me.

266
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:53,840
You are my wife.
And that gives you the right...

267
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,002
Nonsense to me...
every time you crave.

268
00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:59,726
Honey, are you okay? Very good.

269
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,840
Larry, please
do not make me more "Keeks".

270
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,284
And that way, the "Keeks"...

271
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:19,725
Disappeared... of a couple more.

272
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:46,120
It was not the dog, I did it.

273
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,519
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Baker.

274
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,274
Dr. Vengard
will be delayed a bit.

275
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,035
I hope you do not mind.

276
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,314
Fea. Fea.

277
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,715
Is not that ugly?

278
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:40,396
Who?

279
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,960
People.

280
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:44,241
Is there anything uglier
that a human face?

281
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,831
Would you mind if I smoke?
Not at all.

282
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:55,761
Do you smoke?

283
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,601
Yes.

284
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,309
Do you have a cigarette?

285
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,829
Yes.

286
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,747
Do not have no filter?
Sorry, but no.

287
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:16,034
Do not want it.

288
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,634
I went.

289
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,834
I changed my mind, lo accept.

290
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,068
Thank you.

291
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:41,035
Have you already visited this doctor?
Yes.

292
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,107
What do you charge?
Not really I know.

293
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:47,837
Io not have asked.
Do not worry, eh?

294
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:50,189
The doctor just called.

295
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,234
Io take at least half hour.

296
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:55,753
Half an hour more?
We have two possibilities:

297
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:58,148
We read magazines
or we can chat.

298
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:00,548
A beautiful day, is not it? Yes.

299
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:02,867
My conversation has run out.
Forget it.

300
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,832
Does the bored?
No, all lo otherwise.

301
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,223
I must warn I say what I think.

302
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:08,068
I am completely individualistic.

303
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,226
- Really?
- I'm against...

304
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:10,504
Communism ..., capitalism...

305
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,273
Fascism, Nazism.
I am against all...

306
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:13,715
And worldwide.

307
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:16,551
I hate my fellow
and they hate me.

308
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:19,991
I find it very funny.
So you amused?

309
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:23,147
I think a clown, huh?
No, I did not say that.

310
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:24,834
Anyway, do not apologize.

311
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,551
Is that Vengard is good doctor?

312
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,428
I'm sure that will do much good.

313
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:32,547
Why say that? What do I get?

314
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:36,267
I am directed to say.
I'm not a psychoanalyst.

315
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:39,273
How about you what happens?

316
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:41,269
Nothing.

317
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,707
Why are you here?

318
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,104
No visit to a psychoanalyst
to fix their teeth.

319
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,388
What is wrong?

320
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:50,024
- Better read magazines.
- Agreed.

321
00:17:58,673 --> 00:17:59,673
I went.

322
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:23,742
Sorry to bother you again,
but...

323
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:25,788
What to do to be happy?

324
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:28,829
I think Dr. Vengard
know more about that than me.

325
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,022
Need more than you, Mrs. Baker?

326
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,425
Oh, that article.
You know, Mrs. Baker...

327
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:41,705
That is the first time
I've met...

328
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,582
A person... really happy?

329
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,021
It seems irritating.
No, arouses my curiosity.

330
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,788
I have often thought
to be happy...

331
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,706
24 hours a day
must be wonderful.

332
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:53,228
You get used.

333
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,468
In the morning we wake
the song of a small bird.

334
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,621
Before breakfast, you
and Mr. Baker dance a minute.

335
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:01,984
Then Breakfast begins happy.

336
00:19:01,985 --> 00:19:04,617
You are happy,
Mr. Baker is happy...

337
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:08,021
The bird is happy,
Io everything around him is happy.

338
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,699
Listen, my presence
seems to upset him...

339
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,508
So... I'll leave.
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Baker.

340
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,499
If lo is going to take so
I who must leave.

341
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,467
No, I'm afraid the doctor
lack makes it to you.

342
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:22,024
Are you sure, Mrs. Baker?
It is an interesting question.

343
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:23,899
The two are here
for the same reason...

344
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,101
Happiness.

345
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:28,623
You do not have enough,
and the other has too.

346
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,665
Who makes more missing
the doctor?

347
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,863
Interesting, do not you think?
Fascinating...

348
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:36,304
But I will not discuss it.
Yes, I understand, Mrs. Baker.

349
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:39,626
Nice to have known her.
And sorry if I have offended.

350
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,619
- Goodbye, Mrs. Baker.
- Goodbye.

351
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:46,256
I went.

352
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,583
- One moment.
- Yes?

353
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:50,014
I can ask you a question??

354
00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:52,141
Of course.

355
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:53,661
Say.

356
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:55,425
Why do you dislike that picture?

357
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:58,298
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

358
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:00,294
Sit.

359
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,346
The artist has been able
see in that tree...

360
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:08,061
Rather than the camera
who photographed the happy...

361
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:11,416
Mrs. Baker ..., Surface only.

362
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,817
Art is deeper.

363
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:17,623
If I were a painter,
and do a portrait...

364
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:20,374
I do not know what aspect...
would the picture...

365
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:22,816
But it would seem...
to that photograph.

366
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:26,699
Does it make sense what I'm saying?
Yes.

367
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:28,817
Much sense.

368
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:48,416
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

369
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,458
- Be.
- Hello, Sebastian.

370
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:53,455
Hello.
By the way, My name is Sebastian.

371
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,815
Alexander Sebastian.

372
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,173
Would you say something my name?
Be honest.

373
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,411
Well, since you insist, no.
No matter.

374
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:03,016
Why would know?
Let's see the pictures.

375
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,694
Number? 15?

376
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,813
It Child with trumpet?

377
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,690
It's bad.

378
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,540
I feared that he liked.

379
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:20,215
Yet artist found himself.

380
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:22,258
And when you are where is he?

381
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,891
It Child with trumpet?

382
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,779
The child is not bad,
but failed...

383
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,215
Completely... with the trumpet.
Certainly.

384
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:33,617
- This is horrible.
- I agree.

385
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:36,739
I went!

386
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,299
It's almost a masterpiece.

387
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,530
- Io Who painted it?
- A woman.

388
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:47,691
No man have dared.

389
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:50,977
The 26.

390
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:55,212
Ellionord Strap.
Portrait of Alexander Sebastian.

391
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:57,609
I can not deny it, I am.

392
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,454
That woman I painted,
I did an autopsy, he saw me.

393
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:04,247
Frankly, I think a puzzle.

394
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:07,012
A puzzle? That is, either.

395
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,135
I was for her a puzzle...

396
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:10,816
Io... but it was not for me.

397
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,576
And here's your revenge.

398
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:15,166
When I saw him for the first time,
I was angry a lot.

399
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,690
I'm not surprised.

400
00:22:21,777 --> 00:22:23,176
What are these notes?

401
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:25,456
I'm a musician, pianist.

402
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,688
Oh, pianist!

403
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:31,090
And this pedestal?

404
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,131
Well, that...

405
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:35,812
Indicates... greatness.

406
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,215
Why not put a bust you over?

407
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:39,451
Is there any reason?

408
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,810
Any.

409
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:42,412
See that little line?

410
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:43,926
Cua?? Is this?

411
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:45,808
There's my problem.

412
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:49,805
That line sent me Dr. Vengard.

413
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:53,291
Although I am inhibited...

414
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,127
Honorísticamente...
Let's have a drink.

415
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:56,695
One moment, one moment.

416
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:59,332
- And this watch?
- Is the clock?

417
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,530
Yes.

418
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,530
I should not be in the picture.
Why?

419
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:05,009
You see, its...

420
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,324
It is a personal matter.

421
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,447
Do you regret coming here?

422
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,724
No, no, quite the contrary.

423
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,931
I find it fascinating.
It's a new world...

424
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:16,846
Io... but not entirely understand.

425
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:19,523
If you want to know something
about me, ask.

426
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:23,966
That clock strikes 12:15.
Is this a detail...

427
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,771
Minor...
or does it mean something?

428
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,208
It means something.

429
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:30,890
But enough about me.
Talk about something else, huh?

430
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:32,806
When will their next concert?

431
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:34,122
When?

432
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,682
When you can overcome it.
Overcome what?

433
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:38,286
That little break.

434
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:41,603
- Concerns inhibition.
- Yes.

435
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:43,729
You see, when I play... Tell me.

436
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,128
Are the 12:15 pm?

437
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:49,200
Of the night.
Alguna particular night?

438
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,488
Returning to my inhibitions...

439
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,004
When I... a private concert...

440
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:58,480
Sorry, Alexander,
Can you tell me more?

441
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:00,687
It was very hot.
Was in the summer?

442
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:02,207
Yes.

443
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:06,123
When I play
for a single person...

444
00:24:06,124 --> 00:24:07,804
For the right person...

445
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:10,242
I'll be completely honest ...,
I believe there...

446
00:24:10,243 --> 00:24:12,130
Best pianist in the world.

447
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:16,008
But in a concert hall,
before an audience, no.

448
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,690
Something is lost.

449
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:22,168
Those faces staring at me.
What right do they look at me?

450
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,202
What right do I hear
for paying $ 2?

451
00:24:25,571 --> 00:24:26,845
Sometimes, two and a half.

452
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:28,325
Why are you bored with this?

453
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:30,766
No, please continue.
It's fascinating.

454
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:33,524
Are you a puzzle,
Mr. Alexander Sebastian.

455
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:36,447
Do not try to fit all
parts, Mrs. Merry Baker.

456
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:37,645
Come on.

457
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:51,281
The 685 Park Avenue
goulash smelled...

458
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,687
Mattresses Universal... when
Furniture and United...

459
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:58,396
Were about to invade
the home of the Baker.

460
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:03,605
Mrs. Kafka.

461
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:06,886
Mr. Jaujeff.

462
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:09,797
Mrs. Geverelsie.

463
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:12,803
- Mr. Jones.
- Jones?

464
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,198
Normal is the only name
I've heard so far.

465
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:17,517
It is the attorney for Mr. Baker.

466
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:21,118
I guess it will take
an attorney with many Hungarians.

467
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:30,558
Good evening, sir. Good evening.

468
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,638
How's the goulash?
Very well, Mr. Baker.

469
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:34,797
He has gotten a package? For me?
No, sir.

470
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:49,677
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

471
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,403
- Alguna? Novelty?
- No.

472
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:54,515
Did you have a good day?
Wonderful.

473
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:57,274
Are you ready for the big party?
Ready.

474
00:25:57,844 --> 00:26:00,641
Remember the word?
"Eguec Seguera".

475
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,682
"Eguec Seguera", that is. Right.

476
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:06,324
What is it?

477
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:10,004
Your package had Ilegado, sir.
Albert lo I had said.

478
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,193
Thank you.

479
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,271
I went.

480
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:54,079
I'm Mr. Baker.

481
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,561
I can ask? What do you do here?

482
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:59,038
- Waiting.
- Ah, waiting.

483
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,795
Tell me, when are we going to dinner?

484
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:03,952
Dinner??
I was invited to dinner.

485
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,000
Sorry.

486
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:14,550
Tell me, are you a Mattress
Furniture Universal or United?

487
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,548
I'm not anything.

488
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,037
Played with two decks, huh?

489
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:21,269
Well, is a smart move.

490
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,838
Tell me, How about Mr. Kafka?

491
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,794
I am indifferent.

492
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,275
Certainly not you very explicit.

493
00:27:29,276 --> 00:27:32,113
The merger has seemed
a great success, and I lo.

494
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,116
The merger creates the union.

495
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,269
Hey, want to enjoy
tonight, right?

496
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,674
Yes, of course.
All right, come on.

497
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:50,793
This carafe disgusts me.

498
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,392
It's ugly. Let's keep.

499
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:58,593
Sure, whatever.
The customer is always right.

500
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,434
Would change something else?

501
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:02,792
Many.

502
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:06,792
I think we will go
an enjoyable evening.

503
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:10,395
I'll tell you a secret.
We "goulash".

504
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:12,788
? "Goulash"?
- Yes, "goulash".

505
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:15,273
For me, scrambled eggs.

506
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:18,587
It was only a suggestion.

507
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:23,108
Discúlpeme,
I have to finish this.

508
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:26,510
Go ahead, make yourself at home.

509
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:37,385
These Hungarians are
members were very rare.

510
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:39,386
Ilegado Have you already?
One other.

511
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,194
Did we smoking, no?
Why lo questions?

512
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:45,027
He does not Ileva.
Do you mean Mr. Sebastian?

513
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:46,264
Sebas??

514
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:47,908
- Who are you?
- Who?

515
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:50,714
It is against all.
It is an individualist.

516
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,705
So rich is?
Money does not care...

517
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:54,194
At all.

518
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:56,993
How do you know?

519
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:59,667
Honey, I is Sebastian,
Alexander Sebastian.

520
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:02,143
I told you about the other day,
but as...

521
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:03,673
Never listen... Io I say.

522
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:04,790
Absolutely nothing.

523
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:07,668
Io Now remember,
the guy who plays the piano.

524
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:10,300
Not the guy who plays the piano,
is a pianist.

525
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:12,463
And soon will very important.

526
00:29:12,464 --> 00:29:14,270
And you'll be very happy
to ensure your hands...

527
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:16,229
At $ 100,000. Look, honey...

528
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,112
I give this dinner especially...
for those Hungarians.

529
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:22,909
Would you be interested in a policy?
Do not even know, or care.

530
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:25,389
Sometimes I just do not understand you.

531
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,430
Tonight we
the ability to close...

532
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:29,469
Treatment... $ 500,000.

533
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:31,549
I have not bothered to prepare
Hungarian overnight...

534
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,746
For president...
Universal Mattress...

535
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:35,629
And you invite...
a guy who plays the piano.

536
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,191
How did you come?

537
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,149
Musicians and mattresses
are bad partner.

538
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,462
Larry, for 6 years
only insurance have spoken.

539
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:43,302
And I'm sick of policies!

540
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:45,621
Is it too much to ask you to let me
spend a night in the company...

541
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:47,305
Rimsky Korsakov...
and Stravinsky?

542
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:50,702
Rimsky Korsakov?? Stravinsky??
Who else did you invite?

543
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:52,703
Why do not you invite
the entire philharmonic?

544
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:55,065
You could have brought Dim Sailor
as a presenter.

545
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:58,108
All right, all right. Forget it.

546
00:29:58,109 --> 00:29:59,629
If you do not want to touch,
not touch.

547
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,466
Does touching?
Yes, not a bad idea.

548
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,062
Maybe I could liven up the party.

549
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:07,697
If Mr. Sebastian consents
in touch, which I doubt...

550
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:10,987
If consented,
not going to be Hungarian folklore.

551
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,425
What will then play?
Something you'd have to pay...

552
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:15,022
$ 2 and a half... to listen.

553
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,464
Does Carnegy Music Hall?
Exactly.

554
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:21,189
In my house, no. Not tonight.

555
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:31,462
What's this?

556
00:30:32,189 --> 00:30:34,384
Is a reproduction
I saw a picture...

557
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:36,106
In an art gallery.

558
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,384
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

559
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:43,187
Tell me, what is it?
Do not lo see?

560
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:47,505
No more jokes, what is?
It is a portrait.

561
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:49,779
A picture? What?

562
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:51,421
From a man.

563
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:54,463
I know that I am a
ignorant insurance agent...

564
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,505
I know nothing... on Stravinsky.

565
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:58,425
But six years married Ilevamos
and I think I've been...

566
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:00,104
Pretty good... a husband.

567
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:01,705
When you ask something,
must answer...

568
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:04,335
As God intended. You have
why make fun of me.

569
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,144
You know what this is?

570
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:11,580
The Grand Canyon!

571
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,176
It's delicious.

572
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:25,779
Sit here, Mrs. Kafka. Thank you.

573
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,257
And so we are the best
company for you.

574
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:30,700
It's possible.
We'll talk after dinner.

575
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:33,013
Certainly. Sit here, Mr. Kafka.

576
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:34,138
Right.

577
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:35,896
Mrs. Baker.
Thank you, Mr. Kafka.

578
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:46,462
Not even Loend Green?
Above all, Loend Green.

579
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:49,376
There is not a work of Wagner,
except a passage from Tristan...

580
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:52,011
It's really beautiful,
because they never played well.

581
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:53,980
Touch lo Got any day?
You for me?

582
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,293
Maybe.

583
00:31:55,943 --> 00:31:59,174
I do not like strawberries.
Sorry.

584
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,781
"Eguec Seguera".

585
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:17,253
Is everything all right, sir Kafka?
Very good.

586
00:32:18,982 --> 00:32:20,700
"Eguec Seguera".

587
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,134
"Eguec Seguera".

588
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:30,100
"Eguec Seguera".

589
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:32,298
"Eguec Seguera".

590
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:45,699
How I appreciate that,
Mrs. Baker.

591
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,172
I was excited this detail.

592
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,410
Now that's hospitality,
Mr. Baker.

593
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,696
I was surprised.
Where lo have learned?

594
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,690
- What does it mean?
- Health.

595
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,736
And lo has spoken perfectly.

596
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:11,057
"Eguec Seguera"!
"Eguec Seguera"!

597
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:19,777
How do you speak Hungarian?
Were you born in Hungary?

598
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:22,577
No, studied music in Budapest.
Budapest?

599
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,058
Oh, Budapest.

600
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:27,412
He lived in...
How was the name that street?

601
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:28,772
Andorussia.

602
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:32,926
I just got a call. Kafka eat...

603
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:34,846
With the agent of the Hudson
morning.

604
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:37,245
Tonight or Never.
What about the legal details?

605
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:39,644
In my office
are drafting contracts.

606
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:40,962
Right.

607
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,086
Did you like the goulash,
Mr. Kafka?

608
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,925
An excellent goulash. Excellent.

609
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:49,085
If your insurance equal lo,
maybe we sign with you.

610
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:51,561
Glad him think so.
I'll explain the details.

611
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:53,611
Yalosin, Labislav, come.

612
00:34:55,413 --> 00:34:57,607
I want you to listen
the proposal of Mr. Baker.

613
00:34:57,608 --> 00:34:59,966
Gentlemen, I will be very brief.
Please...

614
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,451
I have something special...
for you.

615
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:04,888
Mr. Sebastian has had the
kindly touch access...

616
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:08,283
For us. So if you want to sit.

617
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,408
Is it essential to play?
Do not worry.

618
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:25,491
Mrs. Baker.

619
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,290
Yes, Mr. Sebastian?

620
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,443
Would you mind sitting
anywhere else?

621
00:35:33,444 --> 00:35:35,522
- No.
- Thank you.

622
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:39,166
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

623
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:49,638
Is closed.

624
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:53,479
How strange!
The wrench should be here.

625
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,764
Someone closed the piano.
Where is the key?

626
00:35:56,765 --> 00:35:59,125
No I know. Why would anyone
to close the piano?

627
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:00,323
- Sure.
- Is absurd.

628
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,081
I do not understand
why has closed.

629
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:03,476
Where is?

630
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:09,128
As I said, Mr. Kafka,
My proposal will cover...

631
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:10,846
Needs... and...

632
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:13,763
- I've broken.
- Do not worry.

633
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:16,317
Of course not.
Well, Mr. Sebastian...

634
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:18,798
Tell us, what is going to play?

635
00:36:19,368 --> 00:36:22,280
Well first I will interpret...

636
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:26,162
Mrs. Baker. Yes, Mr. Sebastian?

637
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:29,915
Right.

638
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:40,606
Well, start with "The Pathetique"
Beethoven.

639
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:43,279
It has 3 times.

640
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,119
And then, if I'm in the mood...

641
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,878
Variations will touch... Hob...

642
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:49,355
Based on the second theme
the first time.

643
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:51,483
I will continue with my own variation,
based...

644
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:53,124
Changes... in Hob, based...

645
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,402
The second issue...
the first time.

646
00:36:56,886 --> 00:36:58,285
How long does a sonata?

647
00:36:58,286 --> 00:37:00,441
The only one I've heard
lasted 3 pure.

648
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:03,200
It's a catastrophe, a disaster.
We are lost.

649
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,432
Alexander, enough!

650
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,313
Please do not.

651
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,511
No, no, no.

652
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:24,507
That clause of the contract has
saved my bacon, admit it.

653
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:25,712
And now...

654
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:31,673
Wait I'll have some fun.

655
00:39:36,356 --> 00:39:37,266
Good morning. Good morning, sir.

656
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:40,149
That picture in the window...
It's great, is not it?

657
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:43,154
No kidding, what is?
It is the portrait of a man.

658
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,190
Of course, obvious.
Excuse me, sir...

659
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:49,665
But not everyone
understand modern art.

660
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:51,833
Well, thank you.
If you are interested, only costs...

661
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:54,383
$ 500.
- $ 500?

662
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:55,873
It's an important man. No, sir.

663
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:57,752
Not valued by the model.
He is a musician...

664
00:39:57,753 --> 00:40:00,712
Second rate.
Musician? What kind of musician?

665
00:40:00,713 --> 00:40:02,194
Pianist, I think.

666
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:04,948
Could it be Alexander Sebastian?

667
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:08,186
Indeed. He has acknowledged.

668
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:10,067
So a friend of yours.

669
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,230
Would not it be fun to have you
at home...

670
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:13,986
Permanently?

671
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:16,472
Not very fun.

672
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:26,272
It's a phony.

673
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:28,467
Who?

674
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:29,829
IE.

675
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:32,661
Goodbye, Jones.

676
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:56,987
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

677
00:40:58,272 --> 00:41:00,103
Do not you think
a nice surprise?

678
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,465
Yes, great.

679
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,427
The Farm Alegre.

680
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:07,063
I do not notice any joy.

681
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,984
Not deny
the joy of learning music.

682
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:11,258
No.

683
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,060
Alguna? Novelty?
This, do you not enough?

684
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,267
I think spare.
Did you have a good day?

685
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:17,579
Nice.

686
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,262
It seems that you're feeling better.
Yes

687
00:41:20,263 --> 00:41:21,863
I slept 10 hours straight.

688
00:41:21,864 --> 00:41:24,067
And the hiccups is gone
completely.

689
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,547
Is not it good news?

690
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:27,142
Yes, of course.

691
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:30,499
Still visiting Dr. Vengard?

692
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,182
No, I do not need Dr. Vengard.

693
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:35,100
I'm so busy
with music and visits...

694
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:37,908
To art galleries
I have no time for anything.

695
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:40,982
It's wonderful.

696
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:45,265
Do you know?
I begin to glimpse something there.

697
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:48,823
Yes, it begins to take shape
of man.

698
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,823
Why do you say that?
You the other night...

699
00:41:54,824 --> 00:41:57,626
It was a joke. I was teasing.

700
00:41:57,627 --> 00:42:00,585
How will that be a man?
I was nervous about the dinner...

701
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:02,579
And said first lo... I came.

702
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,260
I'm sorry, honey.

703
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:07,266
No, I disagree. I think a man.

704
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:09,862
Do not be stubborn,
I say it was a joke.

705
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,825
So what is it?

706
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:15,463
That's a meadow.

707
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:17,458
It's called Spring Meadow.

708
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:19,745
- In spring.
- Yes.

709
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:23,702
And those musical notes
do they mean?

710
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:27,494
That is the pastor
playing his flute.

711
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:29,337
The shepherds play the flute,
Right?

712
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,655
Yes, yes.

713
00:42:31,706 --> 00:42:33,856
And that clock that 12:15?

714
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:36,096
I do not know the exact meaning...

715
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:37,778
But I guess it is... lunch.

716
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:39,937
The pastor lunch
and then plays the flute.

717
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:42,858
By God! You talk as if never
had been in a meadow.

718
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,573
You see, in modern art
try to break the ways...

719
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:48,577
Conventional... represent
otherwise things...

720
00:42:48,578 --> 00:42:50,019
Through the suggestion.

721
00:42:55,424 --> 00:42:56,743
What are you doing?

722
00:42:57,104 --> 00:42:59,220
Whiskers painting her pastor.

723
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,293
In this pianist
I'll give you a beating.

724
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,260
You could not do a worse thing.

725
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:11,619
She would get pitied him.

726
00:43:11,983 --> 00:43:13,859
Io not become a martyr.

727
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,696
Look at it from the point
of view of a woman.

728
00:43:16,983 --> 00:43:18,132
Wait a minute.

729
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:24,256
Miss Egans,
Do you want to go, please?

730
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:33,700
Miss Egans, we want to know
their views on...

731
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:35,262
Certain situation.

732
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:37,810
Well, Mr. Baker have a friend...

733
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:39,938
And is in trouble.
Who? Is Mr. Baker?

734
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:42,822
- No, the friend.
- Ah, Mr. Baker.

735
00:43:43,742 --> 00:43:45,892
Mr. Baker has nothing to do.

736
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:49,060
Let's imagine that friend
Mr. Brown's his name.

737
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,058
Well, Mr. Brown has a wife.

738
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:53,096
- Mrs. Brown.
- Exactly.

739
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,774
Messrs. Brown
Use bull married...

740
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,136
- How long?
- Say, about 6 years.

741
00:43:58,137 --> 00:43:59,530
- Right.
- Live in Accoard.

742
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:01,850
? Accoard ages 6? How boring.

743
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:04,057
Let's just say living
in New York.

744
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,651
Mr. Brown is concerned
by marriage.

745
00:44:06,652 --> 00:44:09,253
Things are not
as well as before.

746
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:11,137
What kind of man
is this Mr. Brown?

747
00:44:11,138 --> 00:44:12,653
A beautiful person.

748
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,930
Did not you say that?
Yes, beautiful.

749
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:16,930
Is it attractive?
Very attractive.

750
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:18,930
- Did not you say that?
- Yes.

751
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:22,932
Yet she complains.
Rather, it goes away.

752
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:26,057
Yes, and I want things
again be as before.

753
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:27,976
- Who does not?
- Sure.

754
00:44:28,259 --> 00:44:30,249
Well, Miss Egans, as a woman...

755
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,252
Want to tell us...
Cua would be the correct method.

756
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:36,569
I would say a coat
Io mink fix everything.

757
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,650
Already have mink coat.
So what's complaining?

758
00:44:40,098 --> 00:44:42,407
Thank you, Miss Egans.
Nothing more.

759
00:44:42,408 --> 00:44:45,093
You wanted the point
of view of a woman.

760
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,449
Wait, wait.

761
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:50,451
Mrs. Brown is interested
another man.

762
00:44:50,697 --> 00:44:52,369
- And I know Mr. Brown?
- Yes.

763
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,732
- Do you have proof?
- Too.

764
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,090
- Do you have witnesses?
- No.

765
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:57,526
So is lost.
Thank you, Miss Egans.

766
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:59,654
Sorry, Mr. Baker,
but if there are no witnesses...

767
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,091
Io... she will deny.
It's what any woman would do.

768
00:45:02,092 --> 00:45:04,213
Miss Egans, we are satisfied.

769
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,805
I guess I'm the right person...

770
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:08,171
To offer advice,
because they feel too...

771
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,691
Sympathy... Mr. Brown,
and lose patience...

772
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:11,971
With Mrs. Brown.

773
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:13,813
We cases like that daily.

774
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:15,534
She is bored, marriage...

775
00:45:15,535 --> 00:45:16,812
Has become... a habit...

776
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:19,734
Agree... but all things
that her husband provides.

777
00:45:19,735 --> 00:45:23,006
The home should miss.
Do they look somewhat dated?

778
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:25,013
The will to power, Miss Egans.

779
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,445
Anyway, I think that Mr. Brown
is a great guy.

780
00:45:27,446 --> 00:45:29,128
I always thought lo.

781
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:31,933
- What a woman.
- Yes.

782
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:34,050
But he has some ideas
interesting.

783
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:35,568
I have not noticed.

784
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:38,688
Larry, still in love
your wife, right?

785
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:40,208
- Yes.
- Where will you go when...

786
00:45:40,209 --> 00:45:41,210
Out of here ...?

787
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:44,208
I have a business dinner
to Mr. Higgins in his club.

788
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,525
But how am I to sell insurance
with this concern?

789
00:45:46,526 --> 00:45:48,809
Larry, listen, Higgins forget.

790
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:51,248
Forget insurance, go home.

791
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,449
There's only one thing
you have to sell...

792
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,922
And yourself.
The most important customer...

793
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:58,163
You've had in your life awaits.

794
00:45:58,164 --> 00:46:00,245
It's called Mrs. Baker.

795
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:02,323
You are the best seller
the world.

796
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:04,289
There is no marriage
that can not be fixed...

797
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,728
But it needs...
selling it occasionally.

798
00:46:08,293 --> 00:46:10,647
- It is not easy.
- Was it easy...

799
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:12,724
Do insurance...
Iluvias against torrential...

800
00:46:12,725 --> 00:46:14,644
In southern California?

801
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:17,447
It employs a new tactic. Test.

802
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:19,801
Save My Marriage
with a new tactic.

803
00:46:19,802 --> 00:46:23,248
Yes, I have said.
Yes, not a bad idea.

804
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:25,370
But Cua may be this new tactic?

805
00:46:25,371 --> 00:46:27,444
Cua? Can be? Cua??

806
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:29,444
I'll find that tactic.

807
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,241
A surprise, huh?

808
00:46:58,089 --> 00:46:59,647
Hello, my genius!

809
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:03,240
Who will you be this afternoon?

810
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,958
Come on, tell your little.

811
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:09,246
Will you be Mozart,
playful and tender?

812
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:12,121
Or will you be the turbulent
Beethoven...

813
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:14,280
Strong, relentless and fierce?

814
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:17,243
Come on, honey,
Tell your toddler...

815
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:27,440
Guess who's here.

816
00:47:30,888 --> 00:47:33,641
Guess who's here.

817
00:47:34,008 --> 00:47:36,841
The god of gods lowering the...

818
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:43,637
Is it serious? No, only fainted.

819
00:47:43,888 --> 00:47:46,118
Women always are faint.

820
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:49,120
Got any particular reason??
No, no.

821
00:47:49,446 --> 00:47:51,243
He thought I was a genius.

822
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:53,601
Io was discovered that no
and fainted.

823
00:47:53,602 --> 00:47:55,836
Please, are you
at home, be right back.

824
00:47:55,837 --> 00:47:56,962
I'll get something.

825
00:48:15,446 --> 00:48:17,516
Look, Baker, clarify one thing.

826
00:48:17,517 --> 00:48:19,323
You will see a discussion
very hot.

827
00:48:19,324 --> 00:48:21,918
We're going to insult,
can not be avoided.

828
00:48:21,919 --> 00:48:23,962
You will accuse me of something
I deny having made...

829
00:48:23,963 --> 00:48:26,274
And I will believe.
So, before the battle...

830
00:48:26,275 --> 00:48:28,436
I want to make one thing clear.

831
00:48:28,765 --> 00:48:31,517
I will not quarrel.
My hands have provided...

832
00:48:31,518 --> 00:48:34,118
My only sustenance...
and I will not hit you.

833
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,560
Please, love, wake your child.

834
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:51,471
- What happened?
- Well, I...

835
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:53,798
You!

836
00:48:56,962 --> 00:48:59,476
Funny. You know I thought lo?

837
00:48:59,763 --> 00:49:01,993
No, but I think I...

838
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:24,716
Hello?

839
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,230
Hello, Jones. You were right.

840
00:49:28,321 --> 00:49:29,673
We had to use a new tactic...

841
00:49:29,674 --> 00:49:32,036
And I think I found it.

842
00:50:15,397 --> 00:50:18,434
I do not trust you.
Come on, I invite you to a cigar.

843
00:50:19,078 --> 00:50:21,546
Or do you have ulterior motives
or got something in that pure.

844
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:24,834
No, no, it's one of the cigars
that gift to my clients.

845
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:26,630
How old are you, Sebastian?

846
00:50:27,717 --> 00:50:29,116
Less than you.

847
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:31,710
In the prime of life, huh?

848
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:34,545
Do you have good health?
Improve a lot...

849
00:50:34,546 --> 00:50:37,914
When you have eaten,
but I will not quarrel.

850
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:40,032
No, no. I do not want a fight.

851
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:41,993
But not all husbands
share a respect...

852
00:50:41,994 --> 00:50:44,032
I feel for the music.

853
00:50:44,033 --> 00:50:45,629
What would happen?

854
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:47,835
Come on, Sebastian.

855
00:50:48,077 --> 00:50:50,716
I'll do anything for you,
like it or not.

856
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:53,306
We'll make sure your hands.

857
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:55,666
This gives you complete freedom
Action...

858
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:57,234
And I will win.

859
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,153
The two will have won.

860
00:50:59,154 --> 00:51:01,954
I will not quarrel.
No, lo know, I know.

861
00:51:01,955 --> 00:51:03,708
He likes to be isolated.

862
00:51:05,955 --> 00:51:07,627
Insulate there.

863
00:51:09,955 --> 00:51:12,150
Do you know?
Best of all this is that...

864
00:51:12,355 --> 00:51:13,504
Sit.

865
00:51:14,674 --> 00:51:16,312
Is that the insurance will
Hand...

866
00:51:16,313 --> 00:51:18,705
Is a clause...
of your life insurance.

867
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:21,583
Life you sure? What
I want a life insurance?

868
00:51:21,584 --> 00:51:24,826
Do not you have any relatives?
Familiar? Well...

869
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:28,232
I know, heir name my wife.

870
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:31,227
So you can buy a beautiful
piano shaped brooch...

871
00:51:31,228 --> 00:51:33,429
Diamond... instead of keys.

872
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:36,432
Every time you put lo
think of his poor Sebastian.

873
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:39,428
Believe me, it should be
life insurance.

874
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:41,422
And right now.

875
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:53,821
Very well.

876
00:51:54,872 --> 00:51:57,386
Where were you born?
I will not quarrel.

877
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:00,346
Are you in love with my wife?

878
00:52:04,952 --> 00:52:06,431
In love with his wife?

879
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,503
So he got the revólver.

880
00:52:10,352 --> 00:52:12,627
Io Now I understand everything.

881
00:52:13,392 --> 00:52:16,429
Come on, Baker, should give
shame behave well.

882
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:19,662
A crafty insurance agent
as you...

883
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:23,107
Both understood... psychology.

884
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:25,700
I'm surprised have thought that.

885
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,385
Naturally I think his wife
is very attractive...

886
00:52:28,386 --> 00:52:30,938
And charming and I love music.

887
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,021
- Is that loaded?
- Yes.

888
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:37,222
Please Baker, forget that idea.

889
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,343
I'm not in love with his wife.

890
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,622
Well, it will be a day of joy
for musicians.

891
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:44,507
Imagine Beethoven
By calling Mozart.

892
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:46,101
"Hey, Mozart, Piano dusts.

893
00:52:46,102 --> 00:52:48,264
Look who's illegal,
the little genius ".

894
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,022
- Not funny.
- This is not funny.

895
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:52,940
I love my wife, I wanted
during the six years...

896
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:54,427
Married... that Ilevamos.

897
00:52:54,428 --> 00:52:55,862
Comes a guy like you
and lo destroys...

898
00:52:55,863 --> 00:52:58,219
Simply because...
has nothing else to do.

899
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:01,384
No away with it.

900
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,185
If I wanted to really my wife...

901
00:53:05,186 --> 00:53:07,226
If it had come...
to tell me that...

902
00:53:07,988 --> 00:53:09,626
Io... maybe have accepted.

903
00:53:11,548 --> 00:53:14,699
If we had believed that the two
she would be happier without me...

904
00:53:15,347 --> 00:53:18,703
Would have just packed...
and not have to do this.

905
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:21,816
Do you know?

906
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:25,097
For a moment I was worried.

907
00:53:25,346 --> 00:53:27,223
When he got the revólver,
I thought:

908
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:29,617
Here is a citizen conventional.

909
00:53:30,026 --> 00:53:32,778
It would be foolish hide
the truth to a guy like that.

910
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:35,140
But now I see the real Baker...

911
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:38,343
Modern, liberated. Baker...

912
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:40,218
I'll be honest with you.

913
00:53:40,946 --> 00:53:43,698
I'm in love with his wife.
Are you sure?

914
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:45,378
- Quite sure.
- No.

915
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:48,697
So you do not have to kill him?
Do not think it's necessary.

916
00:53:49,385 --> 00:53:51,819
We are faced a very clear.

917
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,500
You are in love
my wife, and she to you.

918
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:57,304
Yes, you will. I've watched
with my own eyes.

919
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,343
Soio I have an alternative.

920
00:54:08,064 --> 00:54:08,894
Hello?

921
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,623
Hello, Jones.
I continue with the tactic.

922
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:26,102
- Have I hit back?
- No.

923
00:54:27,543 --> 00:54:29,692
I should not have done that.
I know and I'm sorry.

924
00:54:29,693 --> 00:54:32,582
Should not have done.
It was a primitive reaction.

925
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,414
I assure
that will not happen again.

926
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:36,016
I will not quarrel.

927
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:39,820
Hello? I'm Laurence Baker.

928
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,132
Reserve me a room for tonight.

929
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:44,413
I'll be right. Thank you.

930
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:49,736
Baker...

931
00:54:51,303 --> 00:54:53,817
Leaves you... really?
Of course, of course.

932
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:56,018
I think I should leave
the floor to her.

933
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,291
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

934
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:00,213
Fair enough. Do not you think?

935
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,534
Yes, I think that's what most indicated.

936
00:55:03,536 --> 00:55:05,294
I'm glad you think so.

937
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:08,015
Do not want any bitterness
between us.

938
00:55:08,981 --> 00:55:11,698
Fortunately I can offer
Jill security.

939
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:14,010
Taking care of your future.
And why not?

940
00:55:14,419 --> 00:55:16,091
It deserves lo. Do not think so?

941
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,767
Yes, yes. I think so.

942
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:20,215
She has given me
the best years of your life.

943
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,935
I'll take a few memories
wonderful to me.

944
00:55:24,941 --> 00:55:28,613
It's a great woman, right?
Yeah, yeah, great.

945
00:55:28,614 --> 00:55:30,770
But it has its flaws.
Who does not?

946
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:32,214
That is true. Yes.

947
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:34,932
Sebastian...

948
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:36,937
If you ever find
in a bad mood...

949
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:38,818
What you have to do is...

950
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:42,213
No, no, I must not tell. No.

951
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,810
Come on, do not act
like a child.

952
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:46,811
What is it?
You see, it's personal.

953
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,775
Come on, what is it?

954
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:52,010
Well, if you ever
located in a bad mood...

955
00:55:52,011 --> 00:55:54,213
And wants to cheer... soon...

956
00:55:54,214 --> 00:55:55,857
There's only... one way.

957
00:55:55,858 --> 00:55:58,929
Cua is??
You have to give "Keeks".

958
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:00,807
? "Keeks"?

959
00:56:01,937 --> 00:56:04,007
- So what is it?
- This.

960
00:56:04,817 --> 00:56:05,932
Keeks!

961
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:09,408
- And do you like?
- He loves.

962
00:56:09,697 --> 00:56:11,096
Man, thank you. Keeks.

963
00:56:13,857 --> 00:56:15,006
Keeks!

964
00:56:17,337 --> 00:56:18,736
Oh, no, no!

965
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:28,413
Now, the reason for the divorce.

966
00:56:28,696 --> 00:56:30,334
According to state law
New York...

967
00:56:30,335 --> 00:56:32,167
Must have...
evidence of adultery.

968
00:56:32,735 --> 00:56:35,294
Is not there some way
less violent?

969
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:37,013
- In New York no.
- Well, say...

970
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:38,688
- Adúltero... that's me.
- Oh, no.

971
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:40,493
I would not mess
in that commitment.

972
00:56:40,494 --> 00:56:42,293
It's the same.
But why are you going to take...

973
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:43,648
- Your fault ...?
- Do not worry.

974
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:44,649
I'll manage.

975
00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:46,572
- A detail from you.
- Thank you.

976
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:48,805
Soio we have
separation of property.

977
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:51,043
The agreement between Laurence Baker,
who we mean...

978
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:53,568
As part... of the first part...

979
00:56:53,569 --> 00:56:55,325
Jill Baker... and who
we refer...

980
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:57,212
As part... of the second part.

981
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,569
It is understood that the
of the first part...

982
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:02,167
Leasehold writing...
the floor of Park Avenue...

983
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,493
The party... of the second part.

984
00:57:04,494 --> 00:57:04,532
To the part of the second half. What about the furniture?
- Yes, and the furniture?

985
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:06,533
What about the furniture?
Yes, and the furniture?

986
00:57:06,654 --> 00:57:08,291
I did not understand...
Yes, yes, I want everything...

987
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:10,046
Transitions to...

988
00:57:10,934 --> 00:57:13,368
Part... of the second part.

989
00:57:13,614 --> 00:57:15,730
Can we discuss this later?
It is better to fix...

990
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:17,292
Especially now. Io you deserve.

991
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:19,809
Well, I...
He intends serjusto only.

992
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,970
You are very generous.
No, just only.

993
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,248
Nothing more.

994
00:57:23,454 --> 00:57:25,569
Well, if you want to stay
with something...

995
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,371
No, I do not need anything.
What good would it do?

996
00:57:28,372 --> 00:57:29,488
- But Larry...
- Lives in a hotel.

997
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:32,452
Where lo would get?
I would have to pay a repository.

998
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:33,090
Sure.

999
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:34,845
Well, I have to correct this.

1000
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:42,570
- What's his name that?
- Jones.

1001
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:44,050
I do not trust IE.

1002
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:49,527
Well, here we are.

1003
00:57:50,572 --> 00:57:52,847
Baker v. Baker.
Sounds awful, right?

1004
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:54,364
It is a legal term.

1005
00:57:55,212 --> 00:57:56,691
Regarding tests of adultery...

1006
00:57:56,692 --> 00:57:58,728
Yes? Who are you going to look?

1007
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,486
I do not know.
Have you thought about someone?

1008
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:03,848
There are several candidates
I'm interested.

1009
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,566
Go.

1010
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:08,166
It's better that way. Liquidate
the matter in a few weeks.

1011
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:09,524
Nice.

1012
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:14,044
Hey, do not be Mary Logan?
Adultery with Mary Logan?

1013
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,368
I hope to find something better.

1014
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,002
When all is settled,
I will travel to South America.

1015
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:22,282
Will one of my friends?

1016
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,327
No, you know I never
I have fallen too well.

1017
00:58:24,529 --> 00:58:26,200
Anybody I know??
This is a divorce...

1018
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:29,724
Not a guessing game.
Is that I have curiosity.

1019
00:58:29,725 --> 00:58:31,845
Do not worry, you can trust me.

1020
00:58:32,049 --> 00:58:35,325
You will not be ashamed.
It will be a very attractive girl.

1021
00:58:41,128 --> 00:58:42,328
Do you really want... divorce?

1022
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:44,165
Of course.
Do not lo do you want?

1023
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:46,763
Well...
Do not tell me not want to lo.

1024
00:58:46,968 --> 00:58:48,368
It would be a great disappointment.

1025
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:51,287
Come on, you're in love
Sebastian.

1026
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:52,961
Otherwise you would not have...

1027
00:58:53,727 --> 00:58:55,524
Well, you would not be here.

1028
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:58,365
You're a great person.

1029
00:58:58,366 --> 00:59:00,722
You have not done this
only a whim.

1030
00:59:01,727 --> 00:59:03,763
I have always believed
you were sincere.

1031
00:59:04,326 --> 00:59:05,441
Always.

1032
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:09,164
I would Ilevarme this recall.

1033
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,604
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1034
00:59:12,206 --> 00:59:13,559
What could you do?

1035
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,043
For my part there is no bitterness.

1036
00:59:17,646 --> 00:59:19,043
It's funny.

1037
00:59:19,044 --> 00:59:20,883
You've always been my husband...

1038
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:24,365
And now, are the
of the first part.

1039
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:26,165
I was your Jill...

1040
00:59:26,926 --> 00:59:30,043
And now refer to me as...

1041
00:59:35,645 --> 00:59:37,522
Well, everything is fixed.

1042
00:59:38,365 --> 00:59:39,559
What happened?

1043
00:59:42,524 --> 00:59:43,797
- What have you done?
- Nothing...

1044
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:45,602
We were reviewing...
some details.

1045
00:59:45,603 --> 00:59:47,357
I do not trust you, Baker.

1046
00:59:47,765 --> 00:59:49,243
Dear, no worry.

1047
00:59:49,244 --> 00:59:51,839
This is a very clear.
Alexander, please.

1048
00:59:52,044 --> 00:59:53,761
I'm really nervous.
Do not you understand?

1049
00:59:53,762 --> 00:59:56,279
Sure, we all have moments
cranky.

1050
00:59:57,163 --> 00:59:58,163
Keeks!

1051
01:00:07,364 --> 01:00:09,637
We will re-read this.
The following agreement...

1052
01:00:09,638 --> 01:00:11,520
Has been signed...
It is useless if we do not...

1053
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:14,156
Agree... adultery.
That's not your business.

1054
01:00:14,157 --> 01:00:15,438
- He's right.
- You Shut up!

1055
01:00:15,439 --> 01:00:17,558
Of course it's my business.
I'll turn...

1056
01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:20,196
A laughingstock... City
by a girl I do not know.

1057
01:00:20,402 --> 01:00:22,518
You will not have that opportunity.
Goodbye.

1058
01:00:28,682 --> 01:00:30,717
- Keeks!
- Do not do that, Baker.

1059
01:00:30,718 --> 01:00:32,361
Jill! Jill!

1060
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:33,881
Jill!

1061
01:00:34,402 --> 01:00:37,279
And that, my dear Jones, is
protecting your original investment.

1062
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,558
Let's have a drink.
I think he has weakened...

1063
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:41,472
- Defenses.
- Weakened?

1064
01:00:41,473 --> 01:00:44,712
I was the broken.
Will come back and eat in my hand.

1065
01:00:44,713 --> 01:00:47,076
It's what I do
with Mrs. Jill Baker.

1066
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:50,159
Henceforth known
and Jill "Blanda" Baker.

1067
01:00:50,561 --> 01:00:52,233
If you want to buy a piano
cheap, I offer mine.

1068
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:54,753
- No.
- Too bad I will be.

1069
01:00:54,754 --> 01:00:58,036
I'll be the mad dog 685
of Park Avenue.

1070
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,559
Baker Hail!

1071
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,154
Lord Jones.

1072
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,433
Yes, Mrs. Baker?

1073
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:07,233
On the evidence of adultery,
What the law requires?

1074
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,476
- Well, I have to...
- No, if I...

1075
01:01:09,477 --> 01:01:11,396
- The adúltera... out.
- Well...

1076
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,554
It must find one
in his apartment with him...

1077
01:01:13,555 --> 01:01:15,356
And I have removed... jacket.

1078
01:01:15,357 --> 01:01:16,554
I understand.

1079
01:01:16,759 --> 01:01:18,477
- Alexander.
- Yes, Jill?

1080
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:20,232
Are you going to take your jacket
for me?

1081
01:01:20,233 --> 01:01:23,231
Whatever you say, honey.
Oh, no! No, no!

1082
01:01:23,232 --> 01:01:25,355
Oh, yes.
Do you really want to do that?

1083
01:01:25,356 --> 01:01:26,870
Certainly. Do you think trick...

1084
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:28,033
- That guy ...?
- Yes.

1085
01:01:28,237 --> 01:01:31,434
Forget, Baker, already
in love with this guy. Keeks!

1086
01:01:33,918 --> 01:01:37,273
Gross! Alexander, Alexander!

1087
01:01:37,274 --> 01:01:39,354
Alexander, small.

1088
01:01:39,798 --> 01:01:41,151
Small?

1089
01:01:41,518 --> 01:01:44,270
Is that what small llamas lo?
Get up, honey.

1090
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:46,951
That's it.
Then you'll be better.

1091
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:48,915
Sit here. That's it.

1092
01:01:49,198 --> 01:01:51,712
I have been married six years
with a brute, not lo knew!

1093
01:01:51,713 --> 01:01:53,275
Divorce is the only solution.

1094
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:54,755
Very well. Why not go to Reno?

1095
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:56,508
Yes, Reno.
I do not want to go West.

1096
01:01:56,509 --> 01:01:59,269
Oh, honey! How are you?
Trembling.

1097
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:01,232
Could establish my residence
Pennsylvania?

1098
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:03,192
What Pennsylvania?
That is near Philadelphia.

1099
01:02:03,193 --> 01:02:04,708
Yes, of course.
It would be nice.

1100
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:07,673
It has a good orchestra.
It would be easy Ilegar to New York.

1101
01:02:07,674 --> 01:02:10,349
Okay, put Pennsylvania?
OK, Pennsylvania...

1102
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,393
China, wherever,
but done with it.

1103
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:15,510
Let's review Pennsylvania law.

1104
01:02:15,511 --> 01:02:17,951
Pennsylvania... What to see?

1105
01:02:21,594 --> 01:02:22,709
Small!

1106
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:26,031
I will divorce even
Io last thing I do in life!

1107
01:02:26,235 --> 01:02:27,235
Article 10.

1108
01:02:27,514 --> 01:02:29,709
The innocent spouse may
getting a divorce...

1109
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,626
If it proves...
the other spouse...

1110
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:33,672
For its cruel...
and barbarians has done...

1111
01:02:33,874 --> 01:02:35,512
Life thoroughly... unbearable...

1112
01:02:35,513 --> 01:02:38,346
To the innocent spouse.
Looks promising.

1113
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:42,149
You will find it easy to be barbaric.
Yes, my innocent spouse.

1114
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:43,752
- What do I have to do?
- Well...

1115
01:02:43,753 --> 01:02:47,427
We gonna call a witness.
Let my secretary.

1116
01:02:47,428 --> 01:02:49,150
First, you must begin
a discussion.

1117
01:02:49,151 --> 01:02:51,228
- Pleasure.
- Then I would say...

1118
01:02:51,229 --> 01:02:52,872
You have to give... a slap.

1119
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:54,988
Bofe give you a... No.

1120
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:57,428
Can you hit a man,
but not a woman?

1121
01:02:57,633 --> 01:02:58,986
You're a coward.

1122
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,473
- Okay, I will.
- Very good.

1123
01:03:00,474 --> 01:03:03,192
Let's try it all. Let's see...

1124
01:03:03,193 --> 01:03:04,547
This is the plan.

1125
01:03:07,392 --> 01:03:08,769
Miss Egans,
Do you want to go, please?

1126
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:10,351
Then, Mr. Jones.

1127
01:03:12,553 --> 01:03:14,669
Now remember,
I will dictate a letter...

1128
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:17,544
Clicks... and as
fingers, start to argue.

1129
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:19,268
And when you say...
Insurance salesman...

1130
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:20,743
Second class.
I give you... the slap.

1131
01:03:20,744 --> 01:03:22,350
That's it.
Baker, do not disappoint us.

1132
01:03:22,351 --> 01:03:24,309
- Miss Egans.
- Miss Egans!

1133
01:03:25,031 --> 01:03:27,750
Here I am, Mr. Jones.
Sit down, please.

1134
01:03:29,911 --> 01:03:31,026
Write.

1135
01:03:31,511 --> 01:03:33,627

1138
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,545
Dear Mr. Dovermill...

1139
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:40,866
Let's see...

1140

So you're not gonna tell me lo?

1141
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:48,749
I was not there.

1142
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:51,343
My mother saw you.

1143
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,630
Your mother is a hysterical old.

1144
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,344
How dare you say that
my dear mother?

1145
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:59,545
Your dear mother, puff!

1146
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:02,541
Do not lo I mean, eh?

1147
01:04:03,188 --> 01:04:05,748

But my mother saw you.

1148
01:04:06,148 --> 01:04:08,025
Your mother is a hysterical old.

1149
01:04:08,229 --> 01:04:10,948
How dare you say
that my dear mother?

1150
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:13,425
Your dear mother, puff!
Who are you...

1151
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:15,067
To say "puff ' my dear mother?"

1152
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:17,108
Your mother... You know who
I remember your mother?

1153
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,866
Enough, enough! One moment.

1154
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:20,348
Miss Egans...

1155
01:04:20,628 --> 01:04:22,266
No... I told him to leave.
Yes, for the love of God...

1156
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:24,226

Dear Mr. Dovermill...

1160
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:36,864
So my mother you dislike?
No, your family upsets me!

1161
01:04:36,865 --> 01:04:38,499
Oh, really?
I dislike your father...

1162
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,804
And your brother! And you know

1163
01:04:40,828 --> 01:04:42,227
Who?

Do not allow
insult him like that!

1169
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:01,141
That's it!

1170
01:05:09,026 --> 01:05:10,982
Listen, all our happiness
is at stake.

1171
01:05:11,185 --> 01:05:13,540
A single slap. Take.

1172
01:05:13,985 --> 01:05:15,418
Take another brandy.

1173
01:05:16,185 --> 01:05:17,937

Everything I have said
Io keep your mother...

1179
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,302
But falls short.
Is that what you think?

1180
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,580
Yes, so I think.
And I'm saying...

1181
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:36,265
You're a seller

1182
01:05:36,544 --> 01:05:37,544

Come on, Baker, calm down.

1189
01:06:00,699 --> 01:06:02,535

1198
01:06:23,098 --> 01:06:24,294

1199
01:06:24,295 --> 01:06:25,495
Who slaps his wife.

1200
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,736
To do had getting drunk.

1201
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,055
Goodbye, Mr. Jones.
Goodbye, Mrs. Baker.

1202
01:06:42,859 --> 01:06:44,371
What do I do

1203
01:06:44,372 --> 01:06:45,938

01:06:58,539 --> 01:06:59,539

1206
01:07:03,777 --> 01:07:04,892
Hello, Albert.

1207
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:07,135
Good morning, sir.
I hope you forgive me...

1208
01:07:07,338 --> 01:07:08,930
For disturbing... on Sunday.

1209
01:07:09,937 --> 01:07:11,336
Never mind.

1210
01:07:11,658 --> 01:07:14,456
Did you sleep late, sir?
Yes, Ilevo several nights as well.

1211
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:16,369
I'm not as young as I thought.

1212
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,096
I think it has look great, sir.

1213
01:07:18,097 --> 01:07:20,253
Thank you, Albert.
How is everything?

1214
01:07:20,254 --> 01:07:22,175
Not too good, sir.

1215
01:07:22,378 --> 01:07:24,016
For plans that have
for your future...

1216
01:07:24,017 --> 01:07:26,737
Could fit me, sir?
Have you left the house?

1217
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:29,094
Yes, sir. I was forced.

1218
01:07:29,095 --> 01:07:31,373
It was for that
musical gentleman.

1219
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:36,132
All we said goodbye except Emma.

1220
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:37,933
He has been able to resist
because he is deaf.

1221
01:07:38,736 --> 01:07:39,736
How is the lady?

1222
01:07:40,295 --> 01:07:41,728
So lovely as always, sir.

1223
01:07:42,376 --> 01:07:43,376
Happy, I guess.

1224
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:45,891
I would not want to offend,
but I think it shows...

1225
01:07:45,892 --> 01:07:47,171
Great value.

1226
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:21,525
- Hello.
- Hello.

1227
01:08:22,254 --> 01:08:23,846
Is Mrs. Baker?

1228
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:33,171
- Jill, my dear!
- Margie!

1229
01:08:33,372 --> 01:08:35,492
I was thrilled when I Ilamaste.
And how could I not?

1230
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:37,489
We are close friends. Sit.

1231
01:08:37,774 --> 01:08:39,730
How are you, Jill? Brilliantly.

1232
01:08:40,013 --> 01:08:41,207
I hear you're Philadelphia.

1233
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:43,926
Have you met Alexander?
Yes, but did not want to bother.

1234
01:08:43,927 --> 01:08:45,651
Being tested his new gig.

1235
01:08:45,652 --> 01:08:46,886
I understand.

1236
01:08:47,612 --> 01:08:50,251
Do you mind?
No, no. I love music.

1237
01:08:50,732 --> 01:08:53,405
Yes, I'm going to Philadelphia.
And are you happy?

1238
01:08:53,406 --> 01:08:56,131
Oh, yes. A lot.
Although I am somewhat stunned.

1239
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,885
Everything is so new to me.
Must be exciting.

1240
01:08:58,886 --> 01:09:00,724
Yes, exciting.

1241
01:09:00,931 --> 01:09:02,249
Moving the world business...

1242
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:06,086
The art world... surrounded
Bach, Tchaikovsky...

1243
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:08,930
Is rehearsing a play Bach.
Oh, yes.

1244
01:09:09,132 --> 01:09:11,566
Are you sure you're okay?
No, no, no, I love it.

1245
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,847
Do not be hesitate, not all
Everyone likes Bach.

1246
01:09:14,052 --> 01:09:16,407
So if you want to stop...
By God, what an idea.

1247
01:09:16,408 --> 01:09:20,723
Everything seems so romantic.
Yes, very romantic.

1248
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:23,086
By the way, have you seen Larry?
Yeah, yeah.

1249
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:25,246
I saw him last night at the Monte Carlo.

1250
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,806
- Larry in Monte Carlo??
- Yes.

1251
01:09:27,807 --> 01:09:29,244
What things.

1252
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,285
One moment.

1253
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:48,364
- Sorry, Margie.
- No matter.

1254
01:09:48,365 --> 01:09:49,723
Well, what we said?

1255
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:54,400
So my music
not to your liking, eh?

1256
01:09:54,401 --> 01:09:56,001
Alexander...
It seems that there is more...

1257
01:09:56,002 --> 01:09:58,245
A noise... annoying. Very well.

1258
01:10:02,688 --> 01:10:03,723
I went!

1259
01:10:07,687 --> 01:10:10,406
- It's so original.
- Certainly.

1260
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:13,360
I hope you do not mind.
Not at all.

1261
01:10:13,361 --> 01:10:16,801
I love when angry.
It becomes a wolf.

1262
01:10:16,802 --> 01:10:19,082
- It must be fascinating.
- Yes

1263
01:10:20,247 --> 01:10:21,282
Jill!

1264
01:10:23,526 --> 01:10:24,720
The wolf.

1265
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,521
- What is it?
- Jill...

1266
01:10:32,522 --> 01:10:35,245
Today... no more music here.
Oh, no?

1267
01:10:35,246 --> 01:10:38,364
No. And do not try to persuade me,
and do not try to shut me up.

1268
01:10:38,846 --> 01:10:41,280
In fact today there will be no
more Sebastian.

1269
01:10:41,485 --> 01:10:44,921
There will be lunch, and
is unlikely to have dinner.

1270
01:10:44,922 --> 01:10:47,680
If you tomártelo well...
Io So take.

1271
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:51,082
Jill, I can be a person
very difficult. Goodbye.

1272
01:10:51,844 --> 01:10:52,959
Goodbye.

1273
01:10:58,845 --> 01:11:00,356
What fun.

1274
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:02,798
I hope that poor Larry
Io as well as I pass.

1275
01:11:02,799 --> 01:11:04,362
For when I saw him
in Montecarlo...

1276
01:11:04,363 --> 01:11:06,320
Oh, yeah, I guess it was
to another such...

1277
01:11:06,321 --> 01:11:09,520
Boring dinners.
All older people, right?

1278
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:11,959
Soio a woman.
More or less your age.

1279
01:11:14,723 --> 01:11:16,235
- Attractive??
- No.

1280
01:11:16,236 --> 01:11:20,316
I do not seem lo. But
George and Freddy loved.

1281
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,440
You know how George and Freddy.

1282
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:26,357
But you do not mind.
Sure, I do not care.

1283
01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:28,518
Larry is entitled have fun.

1284
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,721
If you like that life...

1285
01:11:43,082 --> 01:11:44,117
Hello?

1286
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:46,878
Hi, Sally, dear.

1287
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:51,476
I feel good though
Io's happened, do you?

1288
01:11:54,881 --> 01:11:55,916
That's it.

1289
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:57,596
What?

1290
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,555
Are you sure you leaving lo Ilevabas
the Montecarlo?

1291
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:03,920
One moment.

1292
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,036
Do you hear? Yes, it's here.

1293
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,915
Right.

1294
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,035
Goodbye.

1295
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,560
Hello.

1296
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:29,399
Hello.

1297
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,519
Are you going to take?

1298
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:34,237
Jill, you should not come here.

1299
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,356
It's a bit violent.

1300
01:12:36,558 --> 01:12:38,355
Well, as I walked past.

1301
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:41,356
But if he knew Sebastian...
Do not worry about that.

1302
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,713
I worry.

1303
01:12:43,038 --> 01:12:45,074
A woman who is getting married
soon...

1304
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,475
Should visit... not a single,
and less without notice.

1305
01:12:59,678 --> 01:13:00,713
Well?

1306
01:13:01,358 --> 01:13:04,430
Am I intruding?
Jill, what you wanted to see me?

1307
01:13:04,431 --> 01:13:07,111
Is there anyone?
What do you, Jill?

1308
01:13:07,477 --> 01:13:09,513
I was passing by with the car...

1309
01:13:10,036 --> 01:13:11,913
With the car on the floor 31?

1310
01:13:12,797 --> 01:13:14,913
You said you wanted to have
a memory and...

1311
01:13:14,914 --> 01:13:17,192
Like going to tea Silvia and...

1312
01:13:17,555 --> 01:13:20,911
Had to go through here,
I picked up a few things.

1313
01:13:21,236 --> 01:13:23,352
Some pictures of us together.

1314
01:13:23,555 --> 01:13:25,511
I thought you would hope.
Thank you.

1315
01:13:26,675 --> 01:13:29,030
- Do not you watch the?
- Oh, yes.

1316
01:13:30,316 --> 01:13:32,111
The day we met.

1317
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:33,754
Here you sit on my knee.

1318
01:13:33,755 --> 01:13:35,394
Our wedding. Our honeymoon.

1319
01:13:35,395 --> 01:13:36,909
Very nice, thank you.

1320
01:13:37,595 --> 01:13:38,710
Aigo? Else?

1321
01:13:39,955 --> 01:13:42,071
I heard you were
in the Monte Carlo.

1322
01:13:42,395 --> 01:13:44,351
- Yes, yes.
- Are you sleepy?

1323
01:13:45,114 --> 01:13:46,229
Yes.

1324
01:13:46,754 --> 01:13:49,507
- Well, da Silvia memories.
- Who?

1325
01:13:49,994 --> 01:13:51,791
You were going to have tea with Silvia,
Remember?

1326
01:13:51,792 --> 01:13:53,149
Yes, yes.

1327
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:56,992
I really like this, Larry.
It's beautiful...

1328
01:13:57,234 --> 01:14:00,226
And welcoming. Yes, very cozy.

1329
01:14:04,713 --> 01:14:07,704
It is decorated tastefully.
It's nice.

1330
01:14:07,705 --> 01:14:10,750
So intimate. Beautiful curtains.

1331
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:12,664
And divine views.

1332
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:15,711
Yes, divine views.

1333
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:20,106
Sorry.

1334
01:14:20,593 --> 01:14:22,106
What a fool I've been.

1335
01:14:22,313 --> 01:14:23,712
Please forgive me.

1336
01:14:25,713 --> 01:14:27,465
Larry, it's all my fault.

1337
01:14:28,312 --> 01:14:29,712
There is no evil
that blows no good.

1338
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:33,111
Do not lo be kidding, right?
Of course I'm serious lo.

1339
01:14:33,112 --> 01:14:35,911
Larry, please do not make me
to go to Philadelphia.

1340
01:14:35,912 --> 01:14:37,186
Please.

1341
01:14:37,392 --> 01:14:39,348
The lady has changed mind.

1342
01:14:39,911 --> 01:14:42,983
He tires of her marriage
and leaves for good.

1343
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,426
She do not care leave
ridiculed her husband...

1344
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:46,904
Or hurt.

1345
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:49,905
He tired of the piano music,
back and says:

1346
01:14:49,906 --> 01:14:51,386
Soio has been a small
whim of mine...

1347
01:14:51,471 --> 01:14:53,666
So... please
back to our sweet home.

1348
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,627
You destroy our lives and believe
that you can reconstruct...

1349
01:14:56,628 --> 01:14:59,145
In one afternoon. No, no, no.

1350
01:14:59,349 --> 01:15:00,464
Not so easy.

1351
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:03,066
I did not think it would be easy.

1352
01:15:03,471 --> 01:15:06,383
To tell you what I think
you need more than an afternoon.

1353
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:09,663
What about dinner?

1354
01:15:09,949 --> 01:15:11,587
- Dining??
- Could cenarjuntos...

1355
01:15:11,588 --> 01:15:12,942
Tonight ...?

1356
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:15,747
Sorry, I have a commitment.

1357
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,346
- That girl.
- Yes

1358
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,307
I do not like your tone. Sorry.

1359
01:15:22,509 --> 01:15:23,942
What do you want,
spoil on Sunday...

1360
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:25,700
That poor girl ...?

1361
01:15:26,228 --> 01:15:28,901
Sally no vacation
every day, works hard.

1362
01:15:29,548 --> 01:15:31,664
- Work.
- What's wrong with that?

1363
01:15:32,148 --> 01:15:33,148
Nothing.

1364
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,104
Do not serve everything on tray
like you.

1365
01:15:37,147 --> 01:15:39,024
No visit art galleries,
nor flirts...

1366
01:15:39,228 --> 01:15:42,186
Mediocre musicians ...,
or visit psychoanalysts.

1367
01:15:42,187 --> 01:15:44,702
She has no husband
to pay their complexes.

1368
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:47,906
Sally is a great girl,
than your master Sebastian.

1369
01:15:48,988 --> 01:15:50,660
It does not get my shirts.

1370
01:15:50,661 --> 01:15:52,943
- What I right?
- Forget it.

1371
01:15:54,627 --> 01:15:56,902
You promised to love,
honor and obey.

1372
01:16:00,867 --> 01:16:02,504
The day we met.

1373
01:16:02,505 --> 01:16:05,505
In this picture I am horrible.
But you were great.

1374
01:16:05,987 --> 01:16:07,784
Do not be bored insurance speak.

1375
01:16:07,785 --> 01:16:11,301
Listening. You wanted to know everything
about me and my work.

1376
01:16:11,302 --> 01:16:13,343
- You wanted to help me.
- Larry.

1377
01:16:16,066 --> 01:16:17,545
Io remember everything you said.

1378
01:16:17,546 --> 01:16:20,503
I'd love to tell you again
if you let me.

1379
01:16:21,385 --> 01:16:23,898
Return to forget.
No, Larry, lo not forget.

1380
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:27,137
Never again.
I can not keep pretending.

1381
01:16:27,344 --> 01:16:28,697
I am defeated.

1382
01:16:31,984 --> 01:16:33,019
Good.

1383
01:16:38,464 --> 01:16:40,579
Do not forget this tree in front
Hotel door.

1384
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,335
And the Italian waiter so funny.

1385
01:16:42,336 --> 01:16:43,539
- It was here.
- Yeah, yeah.

1386
01:16:43,744 --> 01:16:45,302
No, it was here.

1387
01:16:45,783 --> 01:16:47,978
- Was here.
- Yes, it's true.

1388
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:49,497
On the terrace.

1389
01:16:50,664 --> 01:16:52,302
- Our first breakfast.
- Yes

1390
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:55,179
Larry, could not cenarjuntos?

1391
01:16:56,223 --> 01:16:57,975
- Not tonight.
- Why not?

1392
01:16:58,624 --> 01:16:59,261
Sally.

1393
01:16:59,262 --> 01:17:00,781
- Let me talk to her.
- No, no.

1394
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:02,739
She is a woman. I understand.

1395
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:03,858
No, no.

1396
01:17:04,062 --> 01:17:06,496
- Please Larry.
- Well.

1397
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:09,895
No lo you deserve, but
I'll see what I can do.

1398
01:17:09,896 --> 01:17:12,496
- Thanks, honey.
- Do not move.

1399
01:17:16,462 --> 01:17:17,975
It will be very violent.

1400
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:39,699
Sally Egans.

1401
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:41,735
Egans.

1402
01:17:42,581 --> 01:17:43,775
That girl.

1403
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:06,094
Keeks!

1404
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:17,656
How are you, Miss Egans?

1405
01:18:17,657 --> 01:18:20,696
Hello, Mrs. Baker.
Nice to see you.

1406
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,969
Mr. Baker would have
happy to attend to...

1407
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:26,890
But very busy.

1408
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:28,770
I asked him to give her purse.

1409
01:18:28,771 --> 01:18:31,131
Oh yeah, forgot lo.

1410
01:18:31,132 --> 01:18:34,414
I did some machine work
for Mr. Baker.

1411
01:18:34,618 --> 01:18:36,813
What machine a Saturday night?

1412
01:18:37,057 --> 01:18:40,810
Well, I also know shorthand.
Sure.

1413
01:18:40,811 --> 01:18:43,013
And came to take notes. Oh, yes.

1414
01:18:43,217 --> 01:18:46,653
Io I will another day, huh?
Goodbye, Miss Egans.

1415
01:18:46,937 --> 01:18:49,053
Goodbye, Mrs. Baker.

1416
01:19:09,656 --> 01:19:10,975
What a fool.

1417
01:19:11,296 --> 01:19:12,490
What a fool.

1418
01:19:24,255 --> 01:19:25,370
Impossible.

1419
01:19:29,295 --> 01:19:31,251
It's more complicated
Io I thought.

1420
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:33,888
That girl is in love with me.
I adore.

1421
01:19:33,889 --> 01:19:36,965
I'm not surprised.
Says he can not live without me.

1422
01:19:36,966 --> 01:19:38,692
- And I believe her.
- Me too.

1423
01:19:38,693 --> 01:19:39,967
Is understandable.

1424
01:19:39,968 --> 01:19:42,089
You're a wonderful man.

1425
01:19:42,293 --> 01:19:45,091
- No.
- Yes, yes, lo are.

1426
01:19:45,973 --> 01:19:48,612
What's for dinner?
You know I can not.

1427
01:19:48,853 --> 01:19:50,206
And after dinner?

1428
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:51,767
Want to be guilty a suicide?

1429
01:19:51,768 --> 01:19:54,493
No, no, no. Not that.
So I can not.

1430
01:19:54,854 --> 01:19:57,493
You're right, it is impossible.

1431
01:19:57,693 --> 01:19:58,887
It's a shame.

1432
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:00,448
Everything could have been
marvelous.

1433
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:01,566
Yes.

1434
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:03,330
Nothing would have spoiled
our happiness.

1435
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:06,164
- Yes, but it's too late.
- Yes.

1436
01:20:06,165 --> 01:20:07,685
This looks like the end.

1437
01:20:08,092 --> 01:20:10,287
Goodbye, Larry, and good luck.

1438
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:13,327
Good Luck.

1439
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:26,683
Try to convince her.

1440
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:42,848
- Is Mrs. Baker?
- Yes, but...

1441
01:20:42,849 --> 01:20:44,085
Dismissed.

1442
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:47,446
Guess who's back.

1443
01:20:57,689 --> 01:21:01,204
Am Bothan, the god
of the gods, who has returned.

1444
01:21:34,047 --> 01:21:36,083
Do not touch so strong, please.

1445
01:22:17,404 --> 01:22:18,632
I went!

1446
01:22:41,684 --> 01:22:46,942
And, he did not hiccup anymore.
