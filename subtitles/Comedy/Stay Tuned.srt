00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,200
Will you stop it?

321
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,302
I am leaving you, roy.

322
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,638
[beeping]

323
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:26,978
I want a man who'll
touch me rather than
his remote control.

324
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,947
Please hang on
a second.

325
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,282
We have to talk!

326
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,052
It's too late
to talk!

327
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,796
Whoa!

328
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,678
Fasten your seat belts,
folks.

329
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,881
It's going to be
a bumpy ride!

330
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,383
Ha ha ha ha!

331
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,652
Ha ha ha ha.

332
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,589
And welcome back to...

333
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,859
<i>You can't win!</i>
<i>You can't win!</i>

334
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:17,695
Now let's welcome
our new contestants

335
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:21,099
Roy and helen knable!

336
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,506
Do you know
the rules of our game?

337
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:29,907
What game?

338
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,311
The game with these
great prizes.

339
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,479
Jay?

340
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,646
<i>Feast your eyes on this--</i>

341
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,782
<i>The all-new nappa-crapper</i>
<i>9000.</i>

342
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,352
<i>You'll never have to</i>
<i>get off your fat butt again.</i>

343
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,887
<i>It has every amenity--</i>

344
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,355
<i>A built-in color tv.</i>

345
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,892
<i>It adjusts to you</i>
<i>so you don't have to move.</i>

346
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,761
<i>No more trips to the kitchen</i>
<i>during commercials.</i>

347
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,898
<i>Better yet, no more annoying</i>
<i>trips to the bathroom.</i>

348
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,335
<i>Your television viewing</i>
<i>never has to be interrupted,</i>

349
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,103
<i>And of course,</i>
<i>win or lose,</i>

350
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:03,207
<i>Every contestant takes home</i>
<i>a set of encyclopedia satanica!</i>

351
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,477
<i>And now it's time to play...</i>

352
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,879
You can't win.

353
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,113
<i>Back to you, guy.</i>

354
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,582
Roy, the first question's
for you.

355
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,584
On your last
wedding anniversary,

356
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,954
You missed
the romantic dinner
your wife had planned.

357
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,490
The reason,
a--car trouble.

358
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,426
B--you were
running a marathon.

359
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,529
C--you were in a bar

360
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:28,065
Swilling a beer,
watching...World series.

361
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,434
Car trouble,
just like i said!

362
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,737
No! Can you take it?

363
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,872
You were watching
baseball?

364
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,008
That's right!

365
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,413
Trust me, babe.
You walked into
the right place.

366
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,999
Very cushy down here.

367
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,584
You can cool your heels
in here for the rest
of eternity

368
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,520
<i>If</i> you
kiss the right ass.

369
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,089
These lips
ain't calloused
for nothing!

370
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,224
Ha ha ha ha!

371
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,126
Are you some kind
of comedian?

372
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,196
I once opened
for liberace in vegas.

373
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:58,863
Great.

374
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,131
This is
the jumbotron.

375
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,767
It's got all the bells
and whistles.

376
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,335
It's our
official scoreboard.

377
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,537
Keeps
track of the sbis.

378
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,639
Souls batted in.

379
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,907
Ha ha ha.

380
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,677
Kind of a sports thing.

381
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,378
[cough]

382
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,782
Time for the
seidenbaums, sir.

383
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,424
Punch 'em up.

384
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:30,094
Mmm...
The seidenbaums.

385
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,129
Yearning for
exotic locales.

386
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:35,766
This episode
takes them to tokyo.

387
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,635
They're having
a wonderful time

388
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,403
Starring in
their own movie.

389
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,140
It's the seidenbaums
versus...

390
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:46,711
The gigantic
stinking-footed lizard!

391
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,112
<i>Aah!</i>

392
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:48,746
Ooh!

393
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,682
Sayonara, mrs. Seidenbaum.

394
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,423
That's entertainment.

395
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,858
Oh, he's good.

396
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,360
He's so good.

397
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,694
Ha ha ha!

398
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,129
Shocking.

399
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,132
Sir, this is pierce,
our new, uh, intern.

400
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,568
If you can't stomach
the sight of blood--

401
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,304
It's not the blood
i find distressing.

402
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,439
It's your lack
of subtext.

403
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,109
Film school graduate.

404
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,210
Yes, sir.

405
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,695
Usc.

406
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,179
I did my thesis
on kurosawa
and spike lee.

407
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,983
Mr. Pierce,
let me educate you
about our organization.

408
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,018
Here at hellvision,

409
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,154
We've turned the process
of soul acquisition

410
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,689
Into an entertainment
extravaganza,

411
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:37,028
And all for the benefit
of one very demanding
viewer below.

412
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,296
The boss himself,

413
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,064
And i don't mean
springsteen.

414
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,333
He has an enormous
appetite for misfortune.

415
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,903
It is our job
to supply him with
an eclectic offering

416
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,906
Of light amusements,
not subtext!

417
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,608
Don't go away, knables!

418
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,045
It's time for...
The final question.

419
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,747
What's that mean?

420
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,083
The pit!
The pit!

421
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,754
Yes, the pit!

422
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,824
And what's down there
today, jay?

423
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:11,595
<i>Lots of slimy, crawly</i>
<i>bad things, guy.</i>

424
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:12,363
Eeeuw!

425
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,031
Now you have
10 seconds

426
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,935
To answer the question
correctly, or be...

427
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,503
Eliminated.

428
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,205
Aah!

429
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:24,108
So the object's
to get to the end--

430
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,044
The object's to kill them
before the end.

431
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,213
Take the knables,
for instance.

432
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,348
They just
checked in.

433
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,117
If they
survive 24 hours,
they go back.

434
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,786
Part of our treaty
with the other side.

435
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,922
Kind of
a geneva convention

436
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,124
In the war
for souls.

437
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,125
Ha ha ha ha!

438
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,395
Name the person
who's recently
been seeing

439
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:45,830
A former lover.

440
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,565
Is it,
a--roy?

441
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,466
No.

442
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,700
B--helen?

443
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,304
Or c--roy and helen?

444
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,540
I know, i know.

445
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,775
The former lovers
we've been seeing
are each other!

446
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:01,679
You're...

447
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,247
Right!

448
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,850
Aah!

449
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:10,354
We'll be back
with the knables'
vacation round

450
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,423
Right after this!

451
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,729
How long do they
usually last?

452
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,298
Whether they go
quickly or not,

453
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,701
In the end,
they always join us.

454
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:26,437
You're forgetting
that wiry little
peruvian chap.

455
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,073
A mistake, mr. Crowley,
that won't be repeated.

456
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,243
Hey, it wasn't me
that loused up. Jeez.

457
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:35,513
Are you implying
that if was my fault?

458
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,114
I'm kidding!

459
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,883
You know me.

460
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,886
Always joking.

461
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,888
I think, mr. Crowley,
it's time for
a little...Field work.

462
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,290
Uh...

463
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,392
Spike.

464
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,828
Sir.

465
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,530
Uh...

466
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,231
Why don't i
take you to lunch?

467
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,301
We can sit down.
We can--

468
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,370
Oh, boy.

469
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:02,173
Hey, spike,
come on.

470
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:03,674
You know me.

471
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:04,775
Heh heh heh.

472
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,977
Chronic
foot-in-the-mouth
disease.

473
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,747
I don't want to
do field work.

474
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:11,282
I'm
executive material.

475
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,250
I belong
here with you.

476
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,020
Aaahhh!

477
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:21,826
Screw up in here,
and you're dead meat...

478
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,627
Dead meat.

479
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,364
<i>Mr. And mrs. Knable,</i>

480
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,966
