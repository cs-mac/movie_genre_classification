00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,130
You were saying somebody's going
to kill him?

317
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,140
Six months ago,
my mom gets a letter from the Ox.

318
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,680
He's down in Peru.

319
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,480
Found some type of skull, a crystal skull.

320
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,220
Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?

321
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,550
The one he found.
<font color="#40a040">WOMAN:</font> Nice jacket.

322
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,020
The Ox and I were obsessed with the
Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.

323
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,270
How do you know about it?

324
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,740
Are you kidding?
It's all he talked about.

325
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,540
He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.

326
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,550
What's it?
It's like an idol?

327
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,420
Deity carving.
Mesoamerican.

328
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,620
There are a number of crystal skulls
in the world.

329
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,720
I saw one in the British Museum.

330
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,360
Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.

331
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,330
All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.

332
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,400
He said this was real and he was off
to a place called Akator with it.

333
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,200
Akator? He said that? You're sure?
Yeah.

334
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,970
That's what he said. He said Akator.
What is it?

335
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,680
It's a mythical lost city in the Amazon.

336
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,750
Conquistadors called it El Dorado.

337
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,880
Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were chosen
by the gods 7,000 years ago

338
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,750
to build a giant city out of solid gold.

339
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,420
It had aqueducts and paved roads

340
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,590
and technology that wouldn't be seen
again for 5,000 years.

341
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,570
Francisco de Orellana disappeared into
the Amazon looking for it in 1546.

342
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,750
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

343
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,760
I don't think it exists.

344
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,510
Why would Ox want to take the skull there?

345
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,410
The legend says that a crystal skull
was stolen from Akator

346
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,450
in the 15th or 16th century,

347
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,150
and that whoever returns the skull
to the city temple

348
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,420
will be given control
over its power.

349
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,370
Power. Right. So there's some kind of power.
What's the power?

350
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,530
I don't know, kid. It's just a story.

351
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,560
No.

352
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,800
From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.

353
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,530
You know, smog in the noggin,

354
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,270
so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.

355
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,140
Now they've got her, too.

356
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,670
Now, Ox said he hid that skull someplace,

357
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,810
and if my mom doesn't come up with it,

358
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,010
they're gonna kill them both.

359
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,900
Now, she said you'd help me.

360
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,100
Me? What's your mom's name again?

361
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,950
Mary. Mary Williams.
You remember her?

362
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,220
There were a lot of Marys, kid.

363
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,520
Shut up!
That's my mother you're talking about!

364
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,390
All right? That's my mother.

365
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,460
You don't have to get sore all the
time just to prove how tough you are.

366
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,980
Sit down. Please. Sit down.

367
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,050
She said if anybody could find
the skull, it's you.

368
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,990
Like you're some type of...

369
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,650
Like a grave robber or something.

370
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,570
I'm a tenured professor of archeology.

371
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,480
Oh, you're a teacher.

372
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,930
Well, that's gonna be a big help.

373
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,980
Anyway, she called me two weeks ago
from South America.

374
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,580
Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

375
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,350
She said she'd just
gotten a letter from the Ox

376
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,420
and mailed it to me
so I could give it to you.

377
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,990
Then the line went dead.
I opened it.

378
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,650
I mean, the thing's pointless, though.
It's just gibberish.

379
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,890
It's not even English lettering.

381
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,300
See those two bricks over there,
at the counter?

382
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,970
I don't think they're here
for the milkshakes.

383

Victoriano Huerta.

How old were you?
About your age.

Your parents must've had a cow, huh?

481

It worked out.
Things were a little tense at home.

on the best of terms, either.

It's not my fault.
It's hers.

485
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,870
She just got P.O.'ed because I quit school.

486
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,440
She thinks
I'm some kind of goof or something.

Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.

489
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,760

490
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm great with the blade.
I just think it's a waste of time.

491

No.

Me and Ox used to read all the time.

Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

He came here for the gold.

Cradle has another meaning in Mayan.

531

I've saved your life.

651
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,990
Unshackle me.
I'll give you a big hug.

652
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,000
You had a Luger pointed
at the base of your skull

653
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,860
the first time we met.

654
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,880
I had the situation under control.

655
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,090
You owe me.

656
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,720
What do you owe them?

657
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,960
After the war, when you turned,

658
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,220
how many names did you give the Reds?

659
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,660
You're not looking
at the big picture here.

660
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,760
How many good men died because of you?

661
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,130
Eventually, they're gonna let me out
of this chair, comrade,

662
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,600
and when they do,
I'm going to break your nose.

663
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,000
"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?

664
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,470
About uniforms?
You think this is about lines on a map?

665
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,240
It's just about money, isn't it?

666
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:18,210
No. Not only money.

667
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,420
A gigantic pile of money.

668
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,920
Don't worry about what
the Russians will pay.

669
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:29,990
It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.

670
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,460
An entire city of gold.

671
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,760
It's what the conquistadors were after.

672
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,410
For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich!

673
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,630
Richer than Howard Hughes!

674
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,070
Blood money, every nickel.

675
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,370
I need you to see the angle here, mate.

676
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,340
Be smart. Do the right thing.
Just like in...

677
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,730
Like in Berlin.
Got me?

678
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,900
Just like in Berlin.

679
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,490
You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?

680
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,210
How fortunate our failure to kill you,
Dr. Jones.

681
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:07,380
You survive to be of service
to us once again.

682
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,310
Well, you know me, always glad to help.

683
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:15,780
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

684
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,670
You recognize those words?

685
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,010
It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer

686
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,170
after he created the atomic bomb.

687
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,640
He was quoting the Hindu bible.

688
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,810
It was nuclear intimidation.

689
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,920
But now this next level of weapon
is ours to have,

690
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,920
yours to fear.

691
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:35,490
Weapon? What weapon?

692
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,320
A mind weapon.

693
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:41,310
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

694
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,950
Now I know why Oxley put the skull
back where he found it.

695
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,250
He knew you were looking for it.

696
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,400
That skull is no mere deity carving.

697
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,510
Surely you knew that
the moment you laid eyes on it.

698
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:56,640
It was not made by human hands.

699
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,460
Who made it, then?

700
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,160
Come on.

701
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,520
The body we found in New Mexico
was not the first.

702
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:11,490
We'd already dissected two others
from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

703
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,410
Saucer men from Mars.

704
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,540
The legends about Akator are all true.

705
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:18,050
Early men could not have conceived it,
much less built it.

706
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:20,280
It was a city of supreme beings

707
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,470
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

708
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,940
You got to be kidding me.

709
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:29,270
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

710
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,900
The New Mexico specimen gave us hope.

711
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,030
Unlike the others we'd found,

712
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,720
its skeleton was pure crystal.

713
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,190
A distant cousin, perhaps.

714
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,820
Maybe they, too, were sent to find Akator.

715
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:49,030
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

716
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:54,020
There is no other explanation.

717
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,080
There's always another explanation.

718
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:00,360
The skull was stolen from Akator
in the 15th century.

719
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,020
Whoever returns it...

720
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,090
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

721
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,130
I've heard that bedtime story before.

722
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,230
It's a legend.
Why do you think Akator even existed?

Ox?

729

Ox, you're faking it, right?

"Through eyes that last I saw in tears..."

731
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,850
Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

732
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,490
You were born in Leeds, England.

733
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,220
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

734
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:55,560
And you were never this interesting.
My name is...

735
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,700
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

736
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,230
What have you done to him?

737
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,570
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

738
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,870
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

739
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,380
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

740
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,110
His mind, it seems, is quite weak.

741
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,480
Let's hope yours is stronger.

742
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:22,100
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

743
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,340
opening a psychic channel.

744
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:28,510
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

745
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:33,180
We believe you can get through to him
after you have done the same.

746
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:36,050
I've got a better idea.
You look at it.

747
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,220
The skull does not speak to everyone,
it seems.

748
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:43,210
Surely you're not afraid, Dr. Jones.

749
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,960
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

750
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,150
Think of the truth behind those eyes.

751
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,720
There may be hundreds of skulls at Akator.

752
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,390
Whoever finds them will control
the greatest natural force

753
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,620

754
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,530

01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,780
It's from Milton.
He's said it before. Why?

823
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:06,390
Ox, you got to tell us
how to get to Akator

824
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:07,890
or they're gonna kill Marion.

825
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,390
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears,

826
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,290
here in death's dream kingdom..."

827
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,090
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

828
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,100
You got to tell us how to get there.
We need...

829
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,670
Get me paper.
Something to write with.

Right. That's right, Ox.

Three times it drops.

835
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,390
The way down.

836
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,790
Three times...
Pictographs.

837
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,260
Ideograms.

838
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:11,170
Good, Ox. Good.

839
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,050
Ox?

840
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,090
It's me, Ox.

841
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:32,870
It's Mutt, Ox.
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

842
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:33,960
It's me.

843
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:36,590
It's me.

844
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:44,020
The wavy lines mean water, of course.
Closed eyes mean sleep.

The sun with the arc over the sky
stands for time, duration.

846
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,090
The word "now" is "until."

847
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,430
These two close together,

848
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:55,900
the horizon and the snake,
mean one thought.

849
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,000
The horizon stood for the world,

850
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:01,370
but it didn't mean the Earth.
It meant big, great.

851
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:07,440
"The water sleeps until the great snake."

852
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:10,440

they're directions. Get me a map!

The great snake is the Amazon, of course,

855
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:19,900
but "sleep," what water sleeps?

856
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:27,510

The Portuguese word for "sleep."

Yes, good. Exactly.

01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,820
He wants us to follow
this curve of the Sono

859
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:39,010
down to where it meets the Amazon
to the southeast.

860
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:40,960
After that, I'm not sure.

861
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:43,490
Kingdom of dreams,
tears and eyes...

01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,450
I have no idea what he means.

01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,850
This could be the route, though.

864
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,980
It's a completely
unexplored part of the canopy.

No, it's a dry sand pit.
I'm sinking, but I'm calm.

881
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,920
Quicksand is a mix
of sand, mud and water.

882
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,850
And depending on the viscosity,
it's not as dangerous

01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:34,660
Still waiting for the return
of the one who was lost.

1162
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:40,880
They are a hive mind.

1163
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:45,100
One being physically separate,

1164
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:47,640
but with a collective consciousness.

1165
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:52,580
More powerful together
than they can ever be apart.

1166
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:04,220
Imagine what they could tell us.

1167
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:06,020
I can't imagine.

1168
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:07,620
Neither could the humans
that built this temple,

1169
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:09,080
and neither can you.

1170
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:12,350
Belief, Dr. Jones, is a gift
you have yet to receive.

1171
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,560
My sympathies.

1172
01:45:15,570 --> 01:45:19,400
Oh, I believe, sister.
That's why I'm down here.

What does he say?

1177
01:45:57,290 --> 01:45:59,960
He says he's grateful
and he wants...

1178
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,350
It.

1179
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:10,320
It wants to give us a gift.

1180
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,040
A big gift.

Tell me everything you know.

I want to know everything.
I want to know.

I've got a bad feeling about this.

A portal!
A pathway to another dimension!

The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."

1221
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:20,650
But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.

1222
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,920
Knowledge was their treasure.
