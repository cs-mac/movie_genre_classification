1
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:33,371
# Hang up the chick habit,
hang it up, Daddy #

2
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:34,999
# Or you'll be alone in a quick #

3
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:39,929
# Hang up the chick habit,
hang it up, Daddy #

4
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:43,312
# Or you'll never get another fix #

5
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:46,616
# I'm telling you it's not a trick,
pay attention, don't be thick #

6
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,243
# Or you're liable to get licked #

7
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,634
# You're gonna see the reason why #

8
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:54,934
# When they're spitting in your eye
they'll be spitting in your eye #

9
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:59,542
# Hang up the chick habit
hang it up, daddy #

10
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:03,371
# Your girl's not a tonic or a pill #

11
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:06,609
# Hang up your chick habit
hang it up, daddy #

12
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,336
# You're just jonesin' for a spill #

13
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,233
# Oh, how your bubble's gonna burst
when you meet another nurse #

14
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:14,892
# She'll be drivin' in a hearse #

15
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:19,888
# You're gonna need a heap of glue
when they all catch up with you #

16
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:21,515
# And they cut you up in two. #

17
00:01:21,553 --> 00:01:24,814
Freemont power, Freemont pride.
Be aggressive, drive, drive, drive.

18
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,085
Freemont power, Freemont pride.

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,007
Be aggressive.
Drive, drive, drive.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,210
Freemont power, Freemont pride.

21
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:33,450
Be aggressive, drive, drive, drive.

22
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:36,355
Go Freemont!
(cheering)

23
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:39,081
Okay, everybody,
tomorrow after classes

24
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:41,637
make sure that you have your uniforms
picked up from the dry cleaners,

25
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:44,742
because the bus for the playoffs
is gonna leave at 7:30 a.m.,

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,958
The next morning, all right?

27
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:47,239
- (sighing)
- Oh my God.

28
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:50,241
But the Doughnut Hole has agreed
to donate four dozen doughnuts.

29
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:52,006
All: Yeah!

30
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,864
Okay, we're gonna kill
the Rangers this year, right?

31
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:55,904
All: Yeah!

32
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:58,017
I can't believe you're leaving.

33
00:01:58,057 --> 00:02:00,642
It's just a couple of hours
before you go.

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,974
Yeah. Right.
Right.

35
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,494
Aren't you excited?
It's playoffs!

36
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:08,443
Yeah. Whatever.

37
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:36,349
Come on.

38
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:38,422
I have to get home for dinner.

39
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:40,698
Please.

40
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,905
Oh, all right.

41
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:55,609
Father:
That's some beef.

42
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:59,767
- Mother: And carrots.
- Yummy.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,556
Thank you, Mother.

44
00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:04,112
Thanks.

45
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:06,606
- Thank you, poodle.
- Sure.

46
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,027
Grace.

47
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:12,490
Father:
Dear Lord,

48
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,922
please bless this food
that we are about to eat.

49
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:19,404
We thank you for the abundance
that You have provided.

50
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:22,705
Please help us to follow Your path,

51
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,415
the one you intended us all to follow.

52
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,686
And Lord...

53
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:34,700
please help us to obey
the roles in life You set for us.

54
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:38,314
For all that is natural and...

55
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,666
healthy...

56
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,620
and sacred,

57
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:47,717
in Your name we pray.

58
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:48,771
Amen.

59
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,852
- Amen.
- Let's eat.

60
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,254
(car horn honking)
Bye, dear.

61
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:28,088
See ya later, swee... I mean tonight.
See you tonight.

62
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,040
Don't forget your
library books by the door.

63
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:31,991
Got them. Bye.

64
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,248
So... are we ready?

65
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:38,360
They'll all be here at 3:00.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,603
Jesus, I hope we're
doing the right thing.

67
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,778
(bell rings)

68
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,629
Shaker Hills, here we come.

69
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:48,150
Remember, 7:30 doughnuts.

70
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:53,905
Boy: Did you talk
to both her parents?

71
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,795
- Girl: She's coming.
- Kill the Rangers.

72
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,919
I'll meet you outside.

73
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,340
Don't you hate it when they do that?

74
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,291
I think it's fun.

75
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:20,203
Maybe he just doesn't do it right.

76
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:28,745
- See ya.
- Bye.

77
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:43,429
(horn honks)
Speed up, jerk!

78
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,948
Jared?

79
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,022
Why are we going so slow?

80
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:53,258
Sorry.
Zoning, I guess.

81
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:05,284
Mike, thanks so much for coming
all the way back out here again.

82
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,744
- That's what we're here for.
- Thank you, Mike.

83
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,338
- Now you've watched the video?
- Over and over.

84
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,232
Come in.

85
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:15,805
(horn honks)

86
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,253
Mike:
The important thing is to be clear.

87
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:21,755
And direct.

88
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,937
But to do it lovingly.

89
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,663
We're not accusing,

90
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,911
we're supporting.

91
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,836
I think I hear the car.

92
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,624
Uh-oh. Here they come.

93
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,653
Surprise.

94
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:49,784
What happened?
Is somebody dead?

95
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,645
They're your favorite.

96
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,223
Now, why don't you just
come on in and sit down, honey?

97
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:57,017
What's going on?

98
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:58,362
Hi, Megan.

99
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:00,436
My name is Mike.

100
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:04,338
Your parents and your friends
want to have a conversation with you,

101
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,543
and I'm here to help
facilitate that dialogue.

102
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:09,782
So why don't we start
by sitting down,

103
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:12,184
and making ourselves
comfortable?

104
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:14,126
How would that be?

105
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:19,700
Now, Peter,

106
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:22,997
would you like to start
the conversation?

107
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,713
Megan, we love you.

108
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,106
We all love you.

109
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:31,662
And lately we've become
concerned about

110
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,799
certain behaviors.

111
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:37,999
We're afraid you're being
influenced by...

112
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:40,489
a way of thinking.

113
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,352
Unnatural...

114
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,240
Do you remember the woman on TV?

115
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:45,615
Honey, we think you're a...

116
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:46,991
(whispers)
Lesbian.

117
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,612
Huh?

118
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:54,507
I myself was once a gay.

119
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:57,891
Now I'm an ex-gay, Megan.

120
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:01,249
I work for a place
called True Directions

121
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:04,107
who help people, like yourself,

122
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,758
to learn to understand
the reasons behind

123
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:09,097
homosexual tendencies,

124
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:11,171
and how to heal them.

125
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:15,945
What tendencies?
Why would you think I'm a...

126
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:19,272
You've been trying
to make us eat this tofu.

127
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:21,246
In diet, watch for a switch to

128
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:22,881
vegetarianism.

129
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,537
You don't have any pictures
of guys in your locker,

130
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:26,884
just these.

131
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,642
Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:29,922
And these.

133
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,135
Sexual,

134
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:34,969
even vaginal motifs
in artwork and decorating.

135
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,899
Gay iconography.

136
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:42,300
You don't even like to kiss me.

137
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:43,287
It's true.

138
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:46,654
I can't believe this.

139
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,623
Denial is a normal part
of the healing process

140
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:51,737
that we'll explore

141
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:54,044
at True Directions.

142
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,949
- Healing?
- Like rehab, honey.

143
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:58,998
Homosexuals Anonymous.

144
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,591
Poodle, it's only for a few months.

145
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,371
There is no way I'm going.

146
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,556
Mother: Let's go.

147
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,247
Now.

148
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,344
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

149
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:23,829
I'm Mary,
I'm the founder of True Directions.

150
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:26,203
- And you must be Megan?
- Yes.

151
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,472
- This is my son, Rock.
- Mother: Hi.

152
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,395
Pleasure to meet you, Megan.

153
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:33,493
Looks like we got you just in time.

154
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,025
What are you, about 17?

155
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,488
- Yes.
- Almost lost her to college.

156
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,472
It's so much harder
once they've been through

157
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,750
all that liberal arts brainwashing.

158
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,890
But we've saved a few.

159
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:45,422
I'll take her from here.

160
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:52,300
Well. Come along.

161
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,734
Mother:
They seem like nice people.

162
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:56,682
(car starts)

163
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,674
(honks)

164
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:38,329
The others arrived yesterday,
so why don't I catch you up?

165
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:42,230
It's a two-month program
based on five simple steps.

166
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:45,468
Why don't we concentrate
on the first step:

167
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:48,186
You admitting your problem.

168
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:49,684
When you see a woman,

169
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,548
in a tight skirt,

170
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:53,371
and long,

171
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,866
beautiful legs,

172
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,178
or perhaps
she's in the bathroom,

173
00:12:57,212 --> 00:13:00,114
putting lipstick
over her full lips...

174
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,944
or maybe in the locker room,

175
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,637
soaping her body...

176
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:05,911
rubbing her breasts...

177
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,800
you don't have any
unnatural thoughts?

178
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,622
I don't think it's unnatural.

179
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:12,079
Ah-ha! You see?

180
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:14,292
You don't even think it's wrong.

181
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:17,044
Until you admit your sickness,
you will wear these.

182
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,989
You will earn the right
to wear civvies

183
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,437
once you have admitted

184
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,194
the first step.

185
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,645
It's a long path
to righteousness, Megan.

186
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,692
And it's a battlefield
of temptation out there,

187
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,620
and you're going
to have to fight.

188
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:30,896
Until then,

189
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:34,248
I'd like you to meet
one of our other soldiers.

190
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,535
Hilary.

191
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:38,858
Megan, this is Hilary.

192
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,654
She will show you around.

193
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:44,005
And, well, you'll get acquainted.

194
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,079
Okay.
Rise and shine at 7:00.

195
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,834
Breakfast at 8:00,

196
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,686
Group therapy until lunch.

197
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:56,263
Now in the afternoon
we have free time to do,

198
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,649
you know, whatever,
and then we move inside

199
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:02,507
for reorientating exercises.

200
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,223
Family therapy on the weekends.

201
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:09,539
You didn't miss much, really.

202
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:15,711
Oh.

203
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:18,403
This is where we sleep.

204
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,083
But there's no inappropriate
behavior allowed.

205
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,420
Inappropriate?

206
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:25,632
Like swearing?

207
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,841
No. Inappropriate like fucking.

208
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:28,892
Oh.

209
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,111
You get caught
in the throes of sodomy,

210
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:32,287
and au revoir.

211
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:44,729
Never mind Graham,
she's a spoiled brat.

212
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,591
I read her chart.

213
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,749
Step one was easy,

214
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:53,053
admitting you're a homosexual.

215
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:56,153
See, we all passed yesterday.

216
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:04,763
I'm a homosexual.

217
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,705
See how easy it is?

218
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,263
Megan, meet the rest of our group.

219
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:20,502
Hi, Megan.

220
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,852
I'm Jan,
and I'm a softball player,

221
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:25,553
and I'm a homosexual.

222
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:30,549
I'm Sinead.
I like pain.

223
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:32,011
I'm a homosexual.

224
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:35,119
I'm Joel.
I'm a Jew.

225
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,778
And a...

226
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,274
ho...

227
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:42,217
homosexual.

228
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:46,314
- We met.
- Graham.

229
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:48,263
I'm Graham, and I like girls,

230
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:50,247
a lot.

231
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,663
I'm a homosexual.

232
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:56,493
Andre.
Actor. Dancer.

233
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,382
Homosexual.

234
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,967
Dolph. Homosexual.
Varsity wrestler.

235
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:02,981
How you doin'?

236
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:06,534
Hi. I'm Clayton Dunn.
I work in retail,

237
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,459
and I'm a homosexual.

238
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:12,100
It's time for your first disclosure.

239
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,375
Now don't be intimidated.

240
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:16,777
Why don't you start by telling us

241
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:20,290
about the first time that you realized
that you might be a lesbian?

242
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:21,758
I'm not.

243
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:24,866
Everyone just thinks I am.

244
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:28,608
I shouldn't even be here.

245
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,011
That's a perfectly
normal place to start.

246
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:37,696
Why don't we discuss
the issues in your intervention?

247
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:42,846
I'm a vegetarian.

248
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,193
All: Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,913
I have pictures of women around.

250
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:49,728
- You think that's normal?
- Sure.

251
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:53,308
I never really thought about it.

252
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,905
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

253
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:59,417
Yes. For two years
we've been going steady.

254
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:02,771
I really love him.
He's smart and popular.

255
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,716
He's got the biggest dick
I've never seen.

256
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,416
Well, um...

257
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:10,486
have you ever had sex with him?

258
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:11,898
I'm a Christian.

259
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:15,160
It's really easy to be a prude
when you're not attracted to him, isn't it?

260
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,780
He's very handsome.

261
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,444
But does he make you hot?

262
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:22,165
Do you think of him
at night when you...

263
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,306
I'm not perverted.

264
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:27,160
I get good grades.
I go to church.

265
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,883
I'm a cheerleader.

266
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:31,922
I'm not like all of you.

267
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,406
Everyone reads "Cosmo."
Everyone looks at other girls.

268
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:37,007
All the time.

269
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:39,915
You only assume that they're thinking
what you're thinking when they look.

270
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,713
But they're not.

271
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,539
Freemont power. Freemont pride.

272
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,522
Be aggressive.
Drive, drive, drive.

273
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:50,799
Go Freemont!

274
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:54,128
I thought everybody
had those thoughts.

275
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,922
I just want to be normal.

276
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,164
Then you admit
you're not normal.

277
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,988
So why don't you admit

278
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:05,412
you are a homosexual?

279
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,267
(voices echoing)

280
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:13,891
Both:
You hug us way too much.

281
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,755
Hilary:
Step one was easy.

282
00:18:15,788 --> 00:18:17,511
You don't even like to kiss me.

283
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,453
You put your hand up my skirt.

284
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:23,011
- Homosexual
- I think it's foul.

285
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:26,473
- Homosexual.
- Homosexual.

286
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,222
- Homosexual.
- Homosexual.

287
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:31,493
I'm a homosexual.

288
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:37,692
I'm a homosexual.
I'm a homosexual.

289
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,774
Congratulations, Megan.

290
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:41,985
You have just taken your first step

291
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:44,225
in your true direction!

292
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:46,814
(clapping)

293
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:52,130
I'm a homosexual.

294
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,847
Okay.

295
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:57,337
Go on now.

296
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:05,783
Don't worry, Megan.
It's gonna be okay.

297
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,963
No.

298
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,821
Here. Put these on.

299
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:17,914
Oh my God.

300
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,153
They were right.

301
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,224
I'm a homo.

302
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,932
Oh my God.

303
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:43,251
Congratulations on
your first step, pom-pom.

304
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,349
Don't listen to her.

305
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,844
She's just upset
'cause the fish on her plate

306
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:54,988
is the only kind she can eat.

307
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,475
I can't wait to be straight.
I've always wanted to be.

308
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:00,173
It's cool to finally talk about it.

309
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,282
I can't tell any of my
friends on the team.

310
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:03,565
Maybe you have
the wrong friends.

311
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,121
I think we should all be
supporting each other.

312
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,527
Really, princess. Do you
want to start the kumbayas?

313
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:18,856
Hi Mom.

314
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,103
The flowers are pretty.

315
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:22,051
I know.

316
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:26,756
I noticed that we sprung
another leak in the ceiling.

317
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:28,770
I'd like for you
to get to it tonight.

318
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,469
I'll get to it, Mom.
Jesus.

319
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:33,576
Ow! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

320
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,071
Look.
Not in my presence.

321
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:37,480
I have told you
over and over again.

322
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:41,124
No more sipping.
Chug it, like a man.

323
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,068
Go on. Chug.

324
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,005
There.

325
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,672
Try and get to that tonight.

326
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,822
(sighs)

327
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:05,785
(electronic buzzing,
soft moaning)

328
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:21,043
Yeah.

329
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,735
Sorry, it's just me.
What are you doing?

330
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:29,747
AV, what's it to ya?

331
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,543
AV? What's that?

332
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:34,066
Aversion therapy, stupid.

333
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:35,894
So what does that mean?

334
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,245
When you have inappropriate
fantasies about girls,

335
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,038
you shock yourself with this shocker.
(buzzes)

336
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:45,269
So every time you think of them,
you feel that pain.

337
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,645
That's sick.

338
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,199
No pain, no gain, baby.
You want to like dick?

339
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,344
You better start training yourself.

340
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:53,454
Hey, isn't that Graham's sock?

341
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:56,144
None of your damn business.

342
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:04,522
(buzzing continues)

343
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,728
Megan.

344
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,679
You have a phone call.

345
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,182
Hello?

346
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:15,980
Mother:
Megan, it's Mom and Dad.

347
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:19,016
We know it's after lights out,
but we miss you so much.

348
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:22,218
Father: We just wanted to know
how our little poodle is doing.

349
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:23,977
I'm doing okay.

350
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:25,420
You were right,

351
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:27,308
I am a homosexual.

352
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:29,315
But I'll be regular soon.

353
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,778
Father: Oh, that Mary
is pretty good then, huh?

354
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,347
Mm-hmm, and Mike
and all others.

355
00:22:33,388 --> 00:22:34,948
I'm already starting step two.

356
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,605
Father: We're so glad,
and after all that money.

357
00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:39,814
Mother: We can't wait
to see you up there at graduation,

358
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,468
to have you home,
so we can all be together again.

359
00:22:42,505 --> 00:22:43,487
Father:
Just remember we love you.

360
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,863
We would do anything for our Megan
to have a normal life,

361
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,871
- and if you need anything...
- Mother: We'd better go.

362
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:48,991
Now you hang in there.

363
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:50,886
- Stay strong!
- Sweet dreams.

364
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,253
You too, Daddy.
See you at family therapy.

365
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:54,693
I love you.

366
00:22:58,017 --> 00:23:00,117
In step two, we'll 
begin the process

367
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:04,041
of everybody rediscovering
their gender identity.

368
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:07,465
Now we all know we're
latent heterosexuals.

369
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:12,989
Now what we must do is
to relearn our masculinity
and our femininity.

370
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:15,913
I know this might be a liitle 
confusing to some of you.

371
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:19,537
Graham

372
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:21,261
What?

373
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,385
Do you like being a pervert?

374
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:28,109
I heard you. Okay?

375
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:31,333
With your masculine/feminine
blah, blah, blah.

376
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:34,657
Like after advanced calc and Chaucer
I can follow this psychobabble.

377
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,681
This psychobabble, young lady

378
00:23:36,705 --> 00:23:40,705
is the only healthy alternative
to the gay lifestyle.

379
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:45,629
Other than guzzling a bottle of 
tranquilizers or slashing your wrists.

380
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:49,953
Okay.

381
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:55,077
Now, who's ready 
to have some fun?

382
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,971
And forward.

383
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:02,012
Backwards and forwards,

384
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:05,564
and backwards.
In a very clean line...

385
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:07,643
- you go in, and you go out,

386
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:09,690
And you go up
and you go down.

387
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,031
Girls, is everybody
paying attention here?

388
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:16,375
And you go in and out,
and in and out,

389
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:17,977
and in and out...

390
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:20,699
Get into every little crevice.

391
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:23,190
And in and out.

392
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:24,987
And you slip in...

393
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:26,997
and out...

394
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,885
add a little more oil,
and shove it in,

395
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:31,292
and take it out.

396
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:32,983
Put some muscle into it.

397
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:36,086
Shove it in and out.

398
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:39,472
And shove it in,
and take it out.

399
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,050
Okay, who wants
to go down with me?

400
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,318
# Climb before you hide #

401
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,589
# Then fool your pride #

402
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,658
# 'Cause we'll be waiting for ya #

403
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:56,721
# I go back to zero Henry #

404
00:24:56,758 --> 00:25:00,467
# I see what you think you saw #

405
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:05,290
# When you passed me in the hall #

406
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:09,707
# I was... #

407
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:13,838
# There you go you're getting over #

408
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:18,128
# Tap an old friend on the shoulder #

409
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:22,416
# Penny fines for leaving empties #

410
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:27,052
# Lose your mind,
you're just like Henry #

411
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:37,830
# Let's go back to zero... #

412
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:39,810
You're turning into a pretty young lady.

413
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,761
Now hold still.

414
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:45,088
(whistle blows)
Come on!

415
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:49,252
All:
Die! Die! Die!

416
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,966
Okay then,

417
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,847
who's left to report out their root?

418
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,374
Andre?

419
00:25:57,415 --> 00:26:00,578
Shit, Miss Mary, I ain't
the only one who don't got no root.

420
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:02,981
Andre, we don't use profanity,

421
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:05,403
or double negatives
here at True Directions.

422
00:26:07,077 --> 00:26:08,899
Okay, who's next?

423
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:11,779
- Megan.
- Well, I've really been thinking,

424
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:14,745
but, I just can't think of anything.

425
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:17,634
I think our little prom queen
is too afraid to disclose.

426
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:20,154
Oh really?
What's your root, Graham?

427
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:22,168
We're working on your issue,
not mine.

428
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,354
You're deflecting.

429
00:26:23,393 --> 00:26:24,636
Actually,

430
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:27,061
I think it might be
a great idea for Megan

431
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:29,209
to be reminded
of your root, Graham.

432
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,275
My mother got married in pants.

433
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:40,437
All right, let's see, Dolph?

434
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:44,185
Too many locker room showers
with the varsity team.

435
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,202
Hilary?

436
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:48,407
All girl boarding school.

437
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:49,620
Sinead?

438
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:52,178
I was born in France.

439
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:53,396
Clayton?

440
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,670
My mom let me play
in her pumps.

441
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:57,560
I like balls.

442
00:26:57,592 --> 00:26:59,501
Why thank you for that, Jan.

443
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:02,702
Joel?

444
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:04,782
Traumatic breasts.

445
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,691
So, yeah.

446
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:09,195
Now, Megan.

447
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:11,376
Do you see how easy
it could be?

448
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,714
You just have to
dig down into those

449
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:16,846
painful memories,
and you'll find it.

450
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:20,777
Now, Hilary.
Will you please come up here?

451
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,555
Today we are going to learn

452
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:28,488
one of the most wonderful things
about being a heterosexual...

453
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:29,576
friendship.

454
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,110
So what I'd like you all to do,

455
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:32,974
is to start partnering off.

456
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:37,349
Find yourself a friend for
the remainder of the program.

457
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,677
All right, everybody settle.

458
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:45,282
Now that we have all
found someone,

459
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:46,851
what I'd like you to do

460
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:48,801
is practice sometime tonight

461
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:50,948
with these.

462
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:57,541
- It's a woman.
- And what else?

463
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:58,690
I don't know.

464
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:00,005
A mother.

465
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,796
Women have roles.
After you learn that,

466
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:03,741
you'll stop objectifying them.

467
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:06,336
Haven't you been listening
to anything Mary said?

468
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:08,033
Well have you?

469
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:10,623
- Have I what?
- Stopped objectifying them.

470
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:13,312
I'm still looking for my root.

471
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:15,323
Must be tough
when you're such a priss.

472
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:19,807
Your turn.

473
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:24,124
- (buzzing)
- Ow!

474
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,812
You really have to be more prepared
for temptation, Megan.

475
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,376
(sighs)

476
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:36,022
Give it to me.

477
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,365
I'm open.

478
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:56,760
Mike: Boys!

479
00:28:56,794 --> 00:29:00,503
Don't you see how sad
and pathetic you all are,

480
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:04,846
always wanting something
you can't have?

481
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:08,978
If I catch you looking
at another man like that

482
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:10,956
ever again,

483
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,478
you'll be watching sports
the whole weekend.

484
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:19,498
Mary: First thing we do,
is we pull these tabs out.

485
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,257
Then you fold it over.

486
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,397
Right now I've used
food coloring.

487
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:26,290
This way you could
see it better.

488
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:28,177
And if it's a boy, well it

489
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,959
- tinkles out.
- That's the wrong tab, okay?

490
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:32,880
Will you please hold it still
while I'm doing this?

491
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:34,254
You're doing it all wrong.

492
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,328
No, I'm not. If you would just
give it to me to do,

493
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:38,637
it would be fine.

494
00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:39,565
Mary: Girls...

495
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,355
intervene.

496
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,357
Let's try that one more time.

497
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:54,659
...and I realized

498
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,798
that when we finished
swimming lessons

499
00:29:57,835 --> 00:30:01,576
we would change
in front of each other.

500
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,519
And that's it...

501
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:05,384
why I'm a homo.

502
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,832
Andre, that's what kids do
after swimming lessons.

503
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:10,759
Change,
everybody does that.

504
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,766
But I took one look
at those boys,

505
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:15,174
and I got a...
you know what.

506
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:16,930
(coughs)

507
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:21,155
I can relate to that.

508
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,058
When I used to study with Jacob,

509
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,653
we used to touch each others legs,

510
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,252
and rub up against each other.

511
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,527
Blowing each other after
your fuckin' bar mitzvah's

512
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,799
a little bit different
than learning to dog paddle.

513
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,743
That is totally uncalled for.

514
00:30:34,785 --> 00:30:37,403
Well excuse me, but we're paying
a lot of money here

515
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:38,848
to get these kids fixed,

516
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,847
not sit around,
and listen to stories all day.

517
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:44,735
Graham, I hope you're getting
a little more out of this program

518
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:47,003
than that faggot over there.

519
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,559
Mr. Eaton,
I don't find that appropriate.

520
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,826
No, he's right,

521
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:56,952
it was a stupid ass root.

522
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:01,079
I'm never gonna know why
I'm a faggot.

523
00:31:01,115 --> 00:31:02,937
I've heard enough
of this crap.

524
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:04,215
And when you get back
from Switzerland,

525
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,999
you'd better have this gay thing
out of your system. Got it?

526
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:08,462
I got it.

527
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:11,407
You fuck up, no college,

528
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:13,553
no car, no trust fund.

529
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:29,299
I'm not sitting
in any room with faggots.

530
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,634
Mary: Megan...

531
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:39,113
it's your turn to report
out your root.

532
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:41,967
I think it might be
my parents.

533
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,651
Okay, go with that.

534
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:48,397
You know we've kinda been
like this greeting card family.

535
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:51,464
And then there was
that one year where...

536
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:53,957
well Dad was unemployed
and Mom had to support us.

537
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:57,346
Wait a minute,
that was only for nine months.

538
00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:00,585
And then I was offered
a much better job at the plant.

539
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:04,905
Maybe seeing Mom
kind of being the Dad, maybe l...

540
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:09,855
maybe I got the wrong idea
about the roles of men and women.

541
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:11,360
Absolutely.

542
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:14,019
I can't believe that you didn't
mention this earlier.

543
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,438
Your father was emasculated,
your mother was domineering.

544
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,428
Well not exactly.

545
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:21,319
You wanted to emulate your mother.

546
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:24,798
You have no respect for men,
because you don't respect your father.

547
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:27,172
- It's really not like that.
- Megan,

548
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,856
you have found your root.

549
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,518
In order to start healing
this festering wound,

550
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,922
I want you to write a song.

551
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,612
It's very therapeutic,

552
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:41,690
and it's good to put
your feelings down.

553
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:49,206
(blows whistle)

554
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:51,866
Free time is up in 20.

555
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,107
That means inside.

556
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,578
What is it?

557
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:27,532
Nothing. Trash.

558
00:33:34,485 --> 00:33:36,623
What am I, contagious?

559
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:51,787
What is that?

560
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:54,028
I'm stuck on
five, six, seven, eight.

561
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:56,267
- God is good.
- God is straight.

562
00:33:57,263 --> 00:33:59,172
Hey that's good.

563
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,757
It's not supposed
to be intellectual.

564
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:10,821
Cheers are supposed to be simple,
make people feel good.

565
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,681
Cheers make girls
do stupid cartwheels,

566
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:15,081
orgasms make people feel good.

567
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:23,774
Your parents didn't
stay very long.

568
00:34:25,704 --> 00:34:27,525
I imagine it gets uncomfortable

569
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,592
sitting that long
with a stick up your ass.

570
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:34,558
I'm sure they're just trying
to do what's best for you.

571
00:34:34,598 --> 00:34:36,320
I thought it was just an act,
but you really are

572
00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:38,528
as sweet as fucking pie,
aren't you?

573
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:41,019
This is bullshit, Megan.
It doesn't work.

574
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,093
You are who you are.
The only trick is not getting caught.

575
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:49,120
How'd you end up here?

576
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:52,088
I got caught.

577
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:54,103
Doing what?

578
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,678
I had this friend,

579
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:06,427
and we just spent
a little too much time together.

580
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:09,809
What were you doing?

581
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:11,925
What do you think?

582
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:22,552
My step-mom caught us in my room
one day and sent me here.

583
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:28,877
Were you in love with her?

584
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,624
Does it matter?

585
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,404
Careful.
I could report you for that.

586
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:51,128
# 5-6-7-8 #
# God is good #
# God is straight #

587
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:56,252
# 1-2-3-4 #
# Inverts we will #
# be no more#

588
00:35:56,876 --> 00:36:00,976
# 5-6-7-8 #
# God is good #

589
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,900
# God is straight! #

590
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,624
Megan, thank you so
much for that cheer.

591
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,648
It means so much
to all of us.

592
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:30,374
# Open the door #

593
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,455
# Walk in behind her #

594
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:34,404
# Draw back your bow #

595
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,748
# Let it remind her #

596
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:38,723
# No one's around #

597
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:40,707
# No need to fake it #

598
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:42,887
# She's not in love #

599
00:36:42,924 --> 00:36:44,996
# How can she take it? #

600
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:54,980
# Give her the time #

601
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:56,991
# She'll know you mean it #

602
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:58,975
# Make up her mind #

603
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,055
# Throw in her feelings #

604
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,037
# Open the door #

605
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:05,217
# Have her jump through it #

606
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:07,164
# She fell in love #

607
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:09,540
# How could she do it? #

608
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:12,256
# Do you know? Do you... #
(buzzing)

609
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,201
(moaning)

610
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:32,092
(whispering)
Resist temptations...

611
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,299
(heavy breathing)

612
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:56,404
(gasps)

613
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,677
Oh my God.
Please don't tell.

614
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:00,502
Oh my God, help.

615
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:03,438
Shut the fuck up!
You stupid little bitch.

616
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,854
- (electric buzz)
- Ahhh!

617
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:06,196
Hey!

618
00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:07,792
What's going on in here?

619
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:12,814
- A little premature simulation?
- They were kissing.

620
00:38:12,854 --> 00:38:14,959
- She's full of shit.
- Mike, we were just uh...

621
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:16,142
- Mike...
- Don't call my mom.

622
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:19,279
Dolph, I am really
disappointed in you.

623
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:22,414
I thought you had what it took
to get out of here clean.

624
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:24,426
It's time to wake Mary.

625
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:26,801
Come on!
Come on!

626
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,721
Come on!

627
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:39,910
Mary: Whoever started this
is out of this house,

628
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,641
and the other is really
in the dog house.

629
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,587
- Clayton: Not me.
- Dolph: I can't go home.

630
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,884
Mary: I am not interested
in anybody's sob stories.

631
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:51,658
I can only help those
who are willing to help themselves.

632
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:55,303
Now... who started this?

633
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:58,154
Someone has got to start talking!

634
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,968
All right, Clayton, you little pervert...

635
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,975
- What?
...you've got one week of solitary,

636
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:09,765
and if I catch you again you're out.

637
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:15,932
(sighs)

638
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,410
Come on, Mary.

639
00:39:36,993 --> 00:39:39,196
I wish I could've seen
those two boys in action,

640
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:42,330
before Miss Thing over there,
went Nancy Drew on us.

641
00:39:42,368 --> 00:39:45,117
If that little twink
woulda narked on me,

642
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,288
heads would have rolled.

643
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:51,064
Would you tie her to your bed
and zap her to death?

644
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:53,010
Or are you running low
on batteries?

645
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:14,354
Mary:
And here are our love-birds,

646
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:17,108
taking a relaxing
evening stroll together.

647
00:40:17,142 --> 00:40:20,175
Notice how affectionate they are.

648
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:22,482
This could be you.

649
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:26,826
And here is our
happy couple at home.

650
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,696
Now it's important to make
your man feel at ease

651
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:34,087
when he comes home
from a long day at work.

652
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:42,478
Now, when it's time
for lovemaking,

653
00:40:42,512 --> 00:40:46,505
Dan kisses Sue
and touches her breasts.

654
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:50,252
Women often find
this sensation pleasurable.

655
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:02,724
# There's a dream
in the back of my mind #

656
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:07,017
# Across the tracks is where
I'll find my dream... #

657
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,432
# Trailer, trailer,
pretty trailer #

658
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:14,628
# Trailer, trailer,
pretty trailer #

659
00:41:14,664 --> 00:41:18,525
# Talk penny, sing a dime #

660
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:22,461
# My Coleman stove
is broke down all of the time #

661
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:26,396
# Neighbor, neighbor,
call the neighbor #

662
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:30,397
# We'll have dinner
in the trailer... #

663
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:39,232
So do you miss
your friends from home?

664
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,037
I just can't decide
who I miss more,

665
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:47,098
the grunting apes in the letterman jackets
or the bulimic cheerl...

666
00:41:47,136 --> 00:41:49,950
Go ahead, say it.

667
00:41:49,983 --> 00:41:51,892
I didn't... I didn't mean that.

668
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,587
I don't have any friends.

669
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,249
What about you?

670
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:06,065
Well, I thought I did.

671
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:11,024
- Do they know you're here?
- Oh yeah.

672
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:12,975
It's rough.

673
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:34,894
What's going on?
It's almost lights out.

674
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:36,687
We're sneaking out.
Get dressed.

675
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:38,000
But Mary...

676
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,890
Fuck Mary.

677
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:42,606
No way.
There's only four weeks left.

678
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:44,911
There's no way
I'm getting thrown out now.

679
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:48,108
Megan, they're never gonna
find about this.

680
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:49,770
We haven't had fun in forever.

681
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,788
Come on.
We could use a little fun.

682
00:42:57,646 --> 00:43:00,962
- What if we get caught?
- Were not gonna get caught.

683
00:43:05,164 --> 00:43:08,677
If you're not coming with us,
at least don't rat on us.

684
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:10,406
Let's go.

685
00:43:40,547 --> 00:43:42,881
Come on. Hurry up.

686
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:43,863
Go, go, go.

687
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:46,361
Oh we have a nice big group tonight.

688
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:47,514
Get in.

689
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,997
- Okay, fasten your seatbelts.
- Wait.

690
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,217
Oh. We have one more.

691
00:43:56,255 --> 00:44:00,727
- Well it's about fucking time.
- I can't believe I'm doing this.

692
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,286
Hi. I'm Lloyd Morgan-Gordon.

693
00:44:03,325 --> 00:44:05,746
This is Larry Morgan-Gordon.
Glad to have you with us.

694
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:08,210
You'll need one of these.

695
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:12,180
It may not be an exact match, but...

696
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:13,626
First time you've all been AWOL?

697
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:15,993
Larry and Lloyd are ex, ex-gays.

698
00:44:16,026 --> 00:44:17,935
From True Directions?

699
00:44:17,978 --> 00:44:19,766
We were among Mary's ranks
before we defected.

700
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:23,346
We're just trying to provide you all
with a balanced perspective,

701
00:44:23,384 --> 00:44:24,878
to see that there are options.

702
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,181
In the end it's up to you
whether choose to live a...

703
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:29,143
lie.

704
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:30,385
Whether you want
to be who you are

705
00:44:30,423 --> 00:44:33,204
or keep it hidden,
is really more what we're about.

706
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:36,237
So you run like,
the underground homo railroad?

707
00:44:38,453 --> 00:44:40,362
(dance music playing)

708
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,091
Come on, girls.

709
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:57,226
You didn't tell me you were
taking me to a gay bar.

710
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:59,173
Where else would we go?

711
00:45:00,975 --> 00:45:03,724
- I'm gonna get you a drink.
- I don't drink.

712
00:45:24,873 --> 00:45:26,782
I refuse to accept a false
solution to my problem.

713
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,158
I resist temptation
and seek to solve my problem.

714
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:32,453
- I refuse to accept a false...
- What are you doing?

715
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:36,064
- My interventions.
- You know you don't have to do that.

716
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:37,891
Just be yourself.

717
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:53,025
# Baby #

718
00:45:53,058 --> 00:45:56,985
# You're making me want you... #

719
00:45:57,025 --> 00:45:59,359
Hi. Would you like to dance?

720
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:03,516
- Sure she does.
- No, sorry. I can't.

721
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:05,623
That's okay.
Just thought I'd ask.

722
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:07,550
No problem.

723
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:08,826
Too good for one dance?

724
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:11,861
You can't dance with a girl
for a second? Go ahead.

725
00:46:12,861 --> 00:46:14,770
- Hi.
- Hi.

726
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:17,811
Sorry.
I don't dance much.

727
00:46:17,852 --> 00:46:18,866
That's okay.

728
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:23,216
# Making me care,
do doo doo #

729
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:26,324
# Do doo, doo, doo... #

730
00:46:49,428 --> 00:46:51,500
# Baby... #

731
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:54,986
# You're making me want you #

732
00:46:55,026 --> 00:46:56,368
# Want you #

733
00:46:56,402 --> 00:46:59,630
# And baby... #

734
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:01,999
# You're making me love you #

735
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:06,571
- # Love you #
- # We're in the city, city #

736
00:47:06,608 --> 00:47:10,403
# You're making me love you #

737
00:47:10,447 --> 00:47:14,090
# We're in the city, city #

738
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,034
# Makin' me love you... #

739
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:21,735
Megan, it's not what you think.

740
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:25,481
That's why we came here, right?
So you could be yourself.

741
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:28,994
- I don't like Sinead that way.
- Which way is that, clothed?

742
00:47:29,034 --> 00:47:30,921
We weren't doing anything.

743
00:47:30,953 --> 00:47:33,506
When you were going like this,
you weren't doing anything?

744
00:47:33,545 --> 00:47:35,617
No I wasn't...
I wasn't doing that.

745
00:47:36,808 --> 00:47:38,563
It doesn't matter.

746
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:43,837
- Why are you freaking out?
- It's none of my business.

747
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:45,088
Do what you want.

748
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:47,362
You want me to do what I want?

749
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:51,423
- I could care less.
- What I really want?

750
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,282
Screw you.

751
00:48:11,136 --> 00:48:13,590
I'm not supposed to like you.

752
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,742
But?

753
00:48:22,204 --> 00:48:23,829
I wanna do that again.

754
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:47,372
(cheering, music plays)

755
00:49:15,823 --> 00:49:17,765
What are you looking at?

756
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:29,697
Ah! Mary's coming!

757
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:08,664
- Good night.
- Good night.

758
00:50:26,749 --> 00:50:29,978
# Here I go falling down
down, down #

759
00:50:30,012 --> 00:50:31,703
# My mind is a blank #

760
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,903
# My head is spinning
around and around #

761
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:38,354
# As I go deep into
the funnel of love #

762
00:50:40,313 --> 00:50:43,444
# It's such a crazy,
crazy feeling #

763
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:45,204
# I get weak in the knees... #

764
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:47,029
Come on,

765
00:50:47,064 --> 00:50:49,203
throw out the first thing
that comes to your head.

766
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,028
Okay, just think.

767
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:52,973
I already did.

768
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:55,916
Mine is just as good
as anybody else's.

769
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:57,845
I'm a heterosexual.

770
00:50:57,878 --> 00:51:00,724
Not yet, honey.
You're almost there.

771
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,699
And don't speak out of turn.

772
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,878
No, I know, I've never been gay.

773
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:09,005
Jan remember,
you were molested.

774
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:12,141
Just take a look at yourself.

775
00:51:12,178 --> 00:51:14,087
Everybody thinks I'm this big dyke

776
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:17,031
because I wear baggy pants,
and play softball,

777
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:21,228
and I'm not as pretty as other girls,
but that doesn't make me gay.

778
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:25,703
I like guys.

779
00:51:25,742 --> 00:51:29,157
I can't help it.

780
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:31,237
I want a big fat wiener up my...

781
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:32,934
Amen, sister.

782
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:34,598
(sniffs)

783
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,523
I quit.

784
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:39,402
Who in the hell
is she trying to fool?

785
00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:41,957
Hey, Jan.

786
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:43,587
Jan.

787
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:06,495
Group.

788
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:11,004
I have found something
very disturbing this morning.

789
00:52:12,515 --> 00:52:14,270
I would like to know

790
00:52:14,307 --> 00:52:16,728
who has been sneaking out,

791
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,795
with those smut peddling
recruiters?

792
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:22,813
I want names.

793
00:52:24,223 --> 00:52:28,445
I want to know who is involved.

794
00:52:30,782 --> 00:52:32,123
Fine then. Graham?

795
00:52:32,158 --> 00:52:33,880
What do you have to say
for yourself?

796
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,443
Why are you looking at me?

797
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,851
Because I found these
under your bed.

798
00:52:40,316 --> 00:52:42,203
Do you have anything
you'd like to confess?

799
00:52:44,763 --> 00:52:46,355
I didn't sneak out.

800
00:52:46,394 --> 00:52:48,117
But you know who did.

801
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:51,316
No, I don't, but um...

802
00:52:54,072 --> 00:52:57,202
I did realize something
about myself last night,

803
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,167
that I was too scared
to admit until now.

804
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:02,635
Out with it.

805
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:04,368
Come on, out with it.

806
00:53:04,406 --> 00:53:09,772
I have a crush.

807
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,089
On Joel.

808
00:53:14,803 --> 00:53:17,704
It was the first time I really
felt something for a guy.

809
00:53:17,747 --> 00:53:21,869
And it just... it really proved
to me the treatment's working.

810
00:53:21,905 --> 00:53:24,173
Oh, Graham.

811
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:30,470
Now, let this show you

812
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:33,478
what determination has yielded.

813
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:35,406
Fruit.

814
00:53:35,438 --> 00:53:38,023
Now I want you all
to look at Graham's strength,

815
00:53:38,062 --> 00:53:41,225
and how she worked her way
through this five-step program.

816
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,194
And by the way, I am very
disappointed in the rest of you.

817
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:47,780
And I have scheduled a meeting
with each of your parents.

818
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:52,422
If you can't listen to me,
then perhaps you'll listen to them.

819
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,465
Joel: No, I didn't go
to the Cocksucker.

820
00:53:54,505 --> 00:53:56,577
I've never been to the Cocksucker.
I won't.

821
00:53:56,616 --> 00:53:58,525
My cocksucking days are over.

822
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,095
I am normal.

823
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:04,412
Mom, Dad, you have to believe me,
I swear I didn't go anywhere.

824
00:54:04,454 --> 00:54:06,875
You're not gonna tell
your parents are you?

825
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:12,860
(chimes)

826
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:14,329
Now, honey,

827
00:54:14,372 --> 00:54:16,990
your mom and I both know

828
00:54:17,027 --> 00:54:20,093
that you didn't have
anything to do with that...

829
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,203
- that...
- Field trip to the Cocksucker.

830
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:25,111
- Field trip to the Co...

831
00:54:25,153 --> 00:54:28,665
but... if you had gone...

832
00:54:28,704 --> 00:54:32,664
You have to know
that you would be on your own.

833
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:34,808
What's that supposed to mean?

834
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:37,431
Well you can't come home.

835
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,779
We can't allow you to live
an unhealthy lifestyle under our roof.

836
00:54:43,069 --> 00:54:46,549
So, Megan, if that
is what you choose,

837
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:50,449
you're choosing to cut us
out of your life.

838
00:54:52,538 --> 00:54:55,156
Well, great. Great.

839
00:54:55,194 --> 00:54:58,576
Now, what did you
want to tell us?

840
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:02,128
Just that you don't have
anything worry about.

841
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,221
I've been missing Jared a lot,

842
00:55:07,255 --> 00:55:09,621
and can't wait to see him again.

843
00:55:09,654 --> 00:55:13,166
Oh, Megan. That's wonderful.

844
00:55:13,205 --> 00:55:15,310
You just keep up
the good work,

845
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:17,770
and we'll be back
to see you graduate.

846
00:55:17,812 --> 00:55:19,568
Dad: You'll be home
before you know it.

847
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:21,992
Bye-bye, sweetie.

848
00:55:23,698 --> 00:55:27,342
- You be a good girl.
- Goodbye, dear.

849
00:55:31,185 --> 00:55:32,461
Hmph!

850
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,157
(answering machine)
This is Larry and Lloyd Morgan-Gordon.

851
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:39,108
Leave us a message.
(beep)

852
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:42,346
I know you're there.
Now pick it up.

853
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,617
Listen to me,
you little inverts.

854
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:47,270
Okay, you want to play
rough with my kids,

855
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:49,894
then I can play rough with you.

856
00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:52,266
- Time's up.
- Yes, thank you.

857
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:57,219
We've got a little situation
to deal with.

858
00:55:57,258 --> 00:55:59,200
(Chanting)
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

859
00:55:59,242 --> 00:56:01,096
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

860
00:56:01,129 --> 00:56:03,103
Mary:
You have other options.

861
00:56:03,144 --> 00:56:06,111
Don't you want to be normal?

862
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:10,461
Hey, I know you.
I saw you last night.

863
00:56:10,503 --> 00:56:13,917
Hey!
Your daddy know you're a faggot?

864
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,096
Good shot, Graham.

865
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:18,173
What are you doing?

866
00:56:18,213 --> 00:56:20,317
What if he saw us kissing?
What do you want me to do?

867
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:22,527
We're not queer!
We're not going anywhere!

868
00:56:22,564 --> 00:56:26,011
We are here! We're not queer!
We're not going anywhere!

869
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:30,043
That's it. If you don't retreat,
we're coming out.

870
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:31,991
(screaming)

871
00:56:33,729 --> 00:56:37,373
Is this what you teach now, Mary?
Throw stones from glass houses?

872
00:56:37,408 --> 00:56:39,796
You're gonna have a lot
of broken glass around you.

873
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,522
It's part of the process, Lloyd.

874
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,078
It's not easy for them.

875
00:57:00,442 --> 00:57:03,703
- Excuse me
- Oh, thanks.

876
00:57:03,738 --> 00:57:06,454
You are so good
at being straight.

877
00:57:06,488 --> 00:57:10,132
Wow. You have really
big muscles.

878
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:13,844
I keep forgetting about
all these little things.

879
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:17,194
Get her cake.
Get her the cake.

880
00:57:17,238 --> 00:57:19,278
Can I rub them?

881
00:57:19,317 --> 00:57:21,357
Got a little cake right there.

882
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:34,160
That's good.

883
00:57:37,073 --> 00:57:38,796
Oh. Yeah.

884
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:41,647
Mm-mm.

885
00:57:44,175 --> 00:57:46,084
You're really manly.

886
00:57:46,127 --> 00:57:48,036
- Thanks.
- I like that.

887
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:50,216
- Manly is good.
- I feel like the aggressor.

888
00:57:50,254 --> 00:57:53,220
That's nice.

889
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,748
Yeah.

890
00:58:01,067 --> 00:58:02,855
You will all

891
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:05,312
be graded in each category,

892
00:58:05,354 --> 00:58:09,182
and those of you who pass,
will move on to step five,

893
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:13,184
simulated sexual lifestyle.

894
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:16,835
And those of you who fail,
will be sent home.

895
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:20,547
Boys with Mike.
Girls with me.

896
00:58:22,118 --> 00:58:24,768
# Her melody #

897
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:27,008
# Wants her desperately #

898
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,761
# Cry lonely tears #

899
00:58:29,796 --> 00:58:32,315
# 'Cause she's so far from here #

900
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:37,439
# She's a ray of sunshine #

901
00:58:37,474 --> 00:58:41,564
# My only ray of sunshine #

902
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,576
# Her yellow hair #

903
00:58:43,617 --> 00:58:46,038
# Her fiery stare #

904
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,119
# But nothing's right #

905
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,574
# 'Cause she's not here tonight #

906
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:55,956
# She's a ray of sunshine #

907
00:58:55,998 --> 00:59:01,234
# My only ray of sunshine #

908
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:03,315
# I know that I'm going nowhere #

909
00:59:03,356 --> 00:59:06,257
# I wish that she'd
come back to me #

910
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:08,535
# She's all I need #

911
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:11,123
# She's all I need #

912
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:15,437
# All I need to end my misery... #

913
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:17,869
Mike:
Essay topic: My root,

914
00:59:17,912 --> 00:59:21,489
and how it prevented me
from heterosexual loving.

915
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:30,004
# She's a ray of sunshine #

916
00:59:30,037 --> 00:59:35,665
# My only ray of sunshine. #

917
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:39,757
Now, in order
to successfully navigate

918
00:59:39,794 --> 00:59:42,062
the treacherous sea
of temptation,

919
00:59:42,098 --> 00:59:46,472
one must first enter a life
out of homosexuality.

920
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:49,773
I've never seen
such a determined group.

921
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:53,254
And I am passing all...

922
00:59:54,671 --> 00:59:56,426
but one of you.

923
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,299
- Andre.
- Hmm?

924
00:59:59,342 --> 01:00:02,091
You may pack your bags.

925
01:00:02,124 --> 01:00:04,033
Now there's cake in the kitchen.

926
01:00:04,076 --> 01:00:06,018
You'll wanna rest up
for the simulation.

927
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,481
Michael, congratulations.

928
01:00:09,962 --> 01:00:13,639
I just wasn't meant
to be butch.

929
01:00:13,674 --> 01:00:15,583
I'm a sissy.

930
01:00:17,097 --> 01:00:19,333
No.

931
01:00:19,368 --> 01:00:21,757
You should be proud
of who you are.

932
01:00:23,176 --> 01:00:25,248
Hello.

933
01:00:25,287 --> 01:00:28,766
I mean you're more
than just a sissy.

934
01:00:28,806 --> 01:00:31,772
You're nice and clean,

935
01:00:31,814 --> 01:00:34,530
and smart and sexy,

936
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,669
and firm and luscious, and...

937
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,366
Excuse me.

938
01:00:38,403 --> 01:00:40,312
The last thing
I need right now

939
01:00:40,355 --> 01:00:42,264
is some fruit
who just proved he's straight

940
01:00:42,307 --> 01:00:45,208
telling my ass how sexy I am.

941
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:49,270
Congratulations, liars!

942
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,548
You know who you are,
and you know who you want.

943
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:53,656
Ain't nobody gonna change that.

944
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:55,517
Shit!

945
01:02:16,587 --> 01:02:19,074
# Breathe into my hands #

946
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:23,390
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from #

947
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:42,874
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

948
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:46,777
# Are you still breathing? #

949
01:02:46,819 --> 01:02:50,561
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

950
01:02:50,594 --> 01:02:54,390
# Are you still breathing #

951
01:02:55,425 --> 01:02:57,497
# Breathe into my hands #

952
01:02:57,537 --> 01:03:02,653
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from... #

953
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:21,303
Graham?

954
01:03:25,241 --> 01:03:28,437
I've never felt that way before.

955
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,381
Except...

956
01:03:32,344 --> 01:03:34,515
Except for what?

957
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:37,267
- Don't laugh, okay?
- I won't.

958
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:41,069
Except for when
I was cheerleading.

959
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:46,828
- Really?
- I'm serious.

960
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:51,438
It sounds stupid to you,
but I really love it.

961
01:03:54,194 --> 01:03:57,390
Cheerleading's the one thing
that's kept me happy.

962
01:04:02,832 --> 01:04:04,719
It's exhilarating.

963
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:10,660
I would love to see you cheer.

964
01:04:10,702 --> 01:04:13,963
- Don't make fun of me.
- No, I'm not.

965
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:17,803
Did you ever think
maybe I'm just jealous

966
01:04:17,836 --> 01:04:19,178
that you love something?

967
01:04:20,268 --> 01:04:23,333
# Breathe into my hands #

968
01:04:23,371 --> 01:04:26,687
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

969
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,582
Get out of bed!

970
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,879
You hormonal hussy.

971
01:04:38,919 --> 01:04:40,806
I can't believe you did this.

972
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,213
You were suppose to be
the role model.

973
01:04:42,246 --> 01:04:44,580
Now get up right now!

974
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,653
What did I do?

975
01:04:46,693 --> 01:04:49,148
Hilary:
A little sleep-over with Graham.

976
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:50,618
(scoffs)

977
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,961
Get dressed right now!

978
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:56,477
Mary:
You of course understand

979
01:04:56,514 --> 01:04:59,034
what your little adventure
has cost you.

980
01:04:59,074 --> 01:05:02,750
You will be removed from the program,
and the premises at once.

981
01:05:02,785 --> 01:05:05,021
I understand.

982
01:05:05,056 --> 01:05:07,739
And of course your parents
have made it very clear

983
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:09,631
that you are just not
welcome home any more.

984
01:05:09,663 --> 01:05:12,597
So you will be left
to your own devices.

985
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:17,364
I mean there may be one thing
that you can do,

986
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:19,576
where we can workout
some kind of a deal.

987
01:05:19,613 --> 01:05:21,336
I'll let you stay,

988
01:05:21,372 --> 01:05:23,259
and graduate with the rest
your class,

989
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:26,106
but you must do me
one favor in return.

990
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:27,600
Partner in simulation
with Rock.

991
01:05:27,643 --> 01:05:28,591
Rock?

992
01:05:31,482 --> 01:05:32,910
I don't think that'll work.

993
01:05:32,953 --> 01:05:34,775
(dance music playing)

994
01:05:39,256 --> 01:05:40,662
Oh, for Pete's sake!

995
01:05:43,575 --> 01:05:45,778
(singing)
# Wham bam, thank you, ma'am. #

996
01:05:45,815 --> 01:05:49,589
Rock, turn it off.

997
01:05:54,132 --> 01:05:55,561
We've lost Megan.

998
01:05:55,604 --> 01:05:57,775
She just wasn't
strong enough.

999
01:05:57,811 --> 01:06:00,680
But you still have a chance
to save yourself.

1000
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:01,932
It's your choice.

1001
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:05,319
You can run off with Megan
and turn into a raging bull-dyke

1002
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:08,045
or you can do the simulation
and graduate,

1003
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:09,968
and lead a normal life.

1004
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,560
There is no choice.

1005
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,323
You came here to graduate,

1006
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,879
and that is exactly
what you are going to do.

1007
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:17,348
You understand me,
young lady?

1008
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,553
This is exactly
why your mother left.

1009
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:22,760
Are you ready to lose
your father?

1010
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:47,326
Then it's settled.

1011
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:50,083
Graham will partner with Rock
in simulation.

1012
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,835
Megan, you're out.

1013
01:06:52,869 --> 01:06:54,724
Skedaddle.

1014
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:59,100
(softly)
I'm sorry.

1015
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,574
Man:
What do you want?

1016
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:41,398
I need to talk
to Lloyd and Larry.

1017
01:07:41,434 --> 01:07:43,157
But you're from True Directions.

1018
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:44,622
- Yeah.
- (window shuts)

1019
01:07:44,665 --> 01:07:46,290
Hey, not anymore.

1020
01:07:48,887 --> 01:07:51,636
All right, kid,
get in here.

1021
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:53,426
Come on, move your tush.

1022
01:07:55,574 --> 01:07:56,915
I can't go back.

1023
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:59,698
I thought you could teach me
how to be a lesbian,

1024
01:07:59,732 --> 01:08:02,546
what they wear,
where they live.

1025
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,725
You know.

1026
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,954
Megan, we can't
help you with that.

1027
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:10,093
There's not just one way
to be a lesbian.

1028
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:13,577
You just have to continue
to be who you are.

1029
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:17,228
- Dolph?
- Megan.

1030
01:08:19,504 --> 01:08:22,056
Thank you so much for saving me
from that place.

1031
01:08:22,095 --> 01:08:23,524
What are you doing here?

1032
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:24,647
I live here.

1033
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:27,882
Or at least until I find a way
to make it on my own.

1034
01:08:29,837 --> 01:08:31,330
It's way better than TD.

1035
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:34,634
We all get our own rooms
and curfew is midnight.

1036
01:08:34,668 --> 01:08:36,358
But we have to share bathrooms.

1037
01:08:36,396 --> 01:08:37,890
Not at the same time,
of course.

1038
01:08:37,931 --> 01:08:39,392
Of course.

1039
01:08:40,394 --> 01:08:41,768
Come on,
it's going to be okay.

1040
01:08:41,803 --> 01:08:43,395
No it won't.

1041
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:48,800
She was supposed to leave with me
and she didn't.

1042
01:08:49,768 --> 01:08:51,677
Whoa, slow down, who?

1043
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:52,701
Graham.

1044
01:08:52,743 --> 01:08:54,172
I knew it.

1045
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:56,451
She was into you
from the start.

1046
01:08:56,487 --> 01:08:58,079
Then why didn't she
come with me?

1047
01:08:58,118 --> 01:08:59,744
Maybe she was scared.

1048
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:01,374
Like I'm not?

1049
01:09:01,413 --> 01:09:04,314
Believe me,
you're better off here.

1050
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,091
Mary:
Graham?

1051
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:14,017
Pay attention.

1052
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,359
Action, Rock.

1053
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,737
Now lean in and kiss her.

1054
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:31,479
Nice, Rock.

1055
01:09:31,517 --> 01:09:34,997
Now, feel how soft
and vulnerable she is.

1056
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,597
Isn't it wonderful?

1057
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:37,978
Now, Graham,

1058
01:09:38,012 --> 01:09:40,215
let him take the lead.

1059
01:09:42,075 --> 01:09:43,635
A little tongue...

1060
01:09:43,675 --> 01:09:46,489
He loves you.
He wants to be with you.

1061
01:09:46,522 --> 01:09:48,757
The way God intended.

1062
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:51,345
To be inside you.

1063
01:09:51,385 --> 01:09:53,588
His love muscle thrusting.

1064
01:09:53,624 --> 01:09:54,966
(both scoff)

1065
01:09:56,119 --> 01:09:57,067
Cut.

1066
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:59,729
Megan, we thought that Dolph
should take you out this week,

1067
01:09:59,766 --> 01:10:01,392
to celebrate your
new freedom.

1068
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,568
- How would that be?
- Sure.

1069
01:10:03,605 --> 01:10:04,947
So, Megan...

1070
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:07,021
what do you want
to do now?

1071
01:10:07,061 --> 01:10:10,508
Larry, Megan just made
a very traumatic decision

1072
01:10:10,548 --> 01:10:13,330
- and she's moving through that process.
- I thought that...

1073
01:10:13,363 --> 01:10:15,501
we could check out
some schools in the city,

1074
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:18,320
- and I could...
- She's not ready...

1075
01:10:18,354 --> 01:10:19,433
Sweetie.

1076
01:10:19,474 --> 01:10:22,026
I'm just asking
a simple question.

1077
01:10:22,065 --> 01:10:24,007
- I'm not interrogating her.
- You are moving into that

1078
01:10:24,048 --> 01:10:26,436
- aggressive space again.
- Can't I even ask a question around here?

1079
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:28,388
Now I feel you moving
into your victim stance.

1080
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:32,773
I was not attacking,
I was verbalizing.

1081
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,903
I just feel like you don't
value my opinion anymore.

1082
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,177
Seems like nothing I do
pleases you.

1083
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,472
I feel inadequate.

1084
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:46,496
I love my Larry bear.

1085
01:10:47,563 --> 01:10:50,529
- Lloyd's sorry.
- Larry bear's sorry, too.

1086
01:10:55,848 --> 01:10:58,052
Okay then.
Dinner's ready.

1087
01:10:59,015 --> 01:11:01,568
Very good.
Okay, who's next?

1088
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:15,294
Okay, now remember
that sex is fun.

1089
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:16,989
We're making love.

1090
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:19,002
There's nothing dirty
about it.

1091
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:22,239
Sex is beautiful when it's
between a man and a woman.

1092
01:11:22,274 --> 01:11:23,550
Mom?

1093
01:11:23,586 --> 01:11:25,756
Okay,
now from this position,

1094
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:27,319
the woman will
spread her legs,

1095
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,335
opening like a flower.

1096
01:11:29,376 --> 01:11:30,804
That's wonderful Graham.

1097
01:11:30,848 --> 01:11:34,108
Now at this point,
the man will insert himself

1098
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,419
into the woman.

1099
01:11:41,245 --> 01:11:42,554
Yes, that's...

1100
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:44,411
Yes. Rock that's it.

1101
01:11:44,444 --> 01:11:46,418
Mrs. Brown?

1102
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,768
What is it, Joel?

1103
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,933
- What about foreplay?
- Foreplay is for sissies.

1104
01:11:50,971 --> 01:11:54,004
Real men go in,
unload and pull out.

1105
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,285
Mom!

1106
01:12:07,446 --> 01:12:08,940
We could dance
if you want to.

1107
01:12:11,318 --> 01:12:12,626
You go ahead.

1108
01:12:13,749 --> 01:12:15,756
I think I need to go get some air.

1109
01:12:30,384 --> 01:12:31,791
I miss her.

1110
01:12:34,192 --> 01:12:36,777
She's scared that maybe
she's making the wrong choice.

1111
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:37,960
But it's her wrong
choice to make.

1112
01:12:37,999 --> 01:12:40,235
You have to be willing
to walk away.

1113
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:44,616
What about you and Clayton?

1114
01:12:44,653 --> 01:12:47,554
If he can't make a stand,
he just can't make a stand.

1115
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:54,051
Well, what about you?

1116
01:12:55,179 --> 01:12:57,153
What are you willing to do?

1117
01:13:04,169 --> 01:13:06,339
I'm so proud of you.

1118
01:13:06,376 --> 01:13:08,579
Doesn't it feel great
to be straight?

1119
01:13:08,615 --> 01:13:12,062
To be out of homosexuality?

1120
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:14,688
It's not always
gonna be easy,

1121
01:13:14,726 --> 01:13:17,092
but at least we know
what to do now.

1122
01:13:18,053 --> 01:13:19,962
Okay, girls,
ready to go?

1123
01:13:23,171 --> 01:13:24,251
Give me the keys.

1124
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:26,559
- I hope she's worth it.
- Is Clayton?

1125
01:13:26,595 --> 01:13:28,383
I'm doing this for you,
not for Clayton.

1126
01:13:28,419 --> 01:13:29,629
Yeah, right.

1127
01:13:37,024 --> 01:13:38,714
There he is.

1128
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:08,272
Let's go.

1129
01:14:25,844 --> 01:14:30,382
Mary: Welcome to the graduating class
of True Directions.

1130
01:14:32,658 --> 01:14:35,527
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present

1131
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:38,732
our happy heterosexuals.

1132
01:14:38,769 --> 01:14:40,295
(applause)

1133
01:15:05,898 --> 01:15:07,523
- Jesus.
- Miss me?

1134
01:15:07,561 --> 01:15:09,023
Why are you here?

1135
01:15:09,065 --> 01:15:10,471
I came to get you.

1136
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:15,330
I can't go anywhere, Megan.

1137
01:15:40,193 --> 01:15:41,818
That was fast.

1138
01:15:41,857 --> 01:15:43,001
Where's Graham?

1139
01:15:44,768 --> 01:15:46,044
I've got to try again.

1140
01:15:56,861 --> 01:15:59,032
We have all gathered
on this special day,

1141
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:02,962
to celebrate the wonderful
true directions.

1142
01:16:06,298 --> 01:16:09,646
And praise be
to our Higher Power.

1143
01:16:11,865 --> 01:16:14,679
Will our graduates
please stand again?

1144
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,389
Sinead Lauren.

1145
01:16:24,438 --> 01:16:25,779
Joel Goldberg.

1146
01:16:34,579 --> 01:16:36,172
Hilary Vandermueller.

1147
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:44,523
Graham Eaton.

1148
01:17:07,659 --> 01:17:10,375
And now,
I think that in closing...

1149
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,937
we should...

1150
01:17:21,736 --> 01:17:22,750
Graham.

1151
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:31,167
One, two, three, four,

1152
01:17:31,205 --> 01:17:33,473
I won't take "no" anymore.

1153
01:17:33,509 --> 01:17:35,516
Five, six, seven, eight,

1154
01:17:35,556 --> 01:17:37,759
I want you to be my mate.

1155
01:17:37,796 --> 01:17:40,184
One, two, three, four,

1156
01:17:40,227 --> 01:17:42,398
You're the one that I adore.

1157
01:17:42,434 --> 01:17:44,768
Five, six, seven, eight,

1158
01:17:44,802 --> 01:17:47,703
Don't run from me
'cause this is fate.

1159
01:17:47,745 --> 01:17:50,592
# Breathe into my hands #

1160
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:54,486
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

1161
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:01,847
I love you.

1162
01:18:04,093 --> 01:18:04,921
Megan...

1163
01:18:04,957 --> 01:18:07,607
you stop it, this instant.

1164
01:18:07,644 --> 01:18:10,545
'Cause you will wallow in the smut

1165
01:18:10,588 --> 01:18:12,245
of your homosexual depravity

1166
01:18:12,283 --> 01:18:13,809
for the rest of your life.

1167
01:18:20,281 --> 01:18:22,353
Go, come on, let's go.

1168
01:18:22,392 --> 01:18:24,781
- (engine starts)
- Megan!

1169
01:18:27,095 --> 01:18:28,273
Wait!

1170
01:18:33,462 --> 01:18:36,843
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1171
01:18:40,915 --> 01:18:44,427
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1172
01:18:44,467 --> 01:18:48,175
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1173
01:18:49,074 --> 01:18:51,594
# Breathe into my hands #

1174
01:18:51,633 --> 01:18:56,782
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from #

1175
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:59,149
# Breathe into my hands #

1176
01:18:59,182 --> 01:19:03,589
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

1177
01:19:03,629 --> 01:19:04,906
(applause)

1178
01:19:08,236 --> 01:19:10,091
My name is Peter,

1179
01:19:10,124 --> 01:19:11,204
and...

1180
01:19:11,244 --> 01:19:14,472
my daughter is a homosexual.

1181
01:19:15,467 --> 01:19:17,670
All:
Hello, Peter.

1182
01:19:31,655 --> 01:19:35,615
# What do they know
when they say I'm too young? #

1183
01:19:35,653 --> 01:19:40,159
# As I get older
and until my life is done #

1184
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:44,800
# I'll be the one
who had love that was true #

1185
01:19:44,836 --> 01:19:48,763
# They all had nothing
and I had you #

1186
01:19:48,802 --> 01:19:50,744
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1187
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,760
# Together forever in love #

1188
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:55,583
# Together forever in love #

1189
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:10,840
# I'll be your reason
for starting your day #

1190
01:20:10,877 --> 01:20:15,415
# You'll be my true love
in every way #

1191
01:20:15,452 --> 01:20:19,412
# I'll always need you
I promise that now #

1192
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:23,988
# Through good and bad
as long as this life will allow #

1193
01:20:24,026 --> 01:20:26,392
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1194
01:20:26,425 --> 01:20:28,497
# Together forever in love #

1195
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:32,333
# Together forever in love #

1196
01:20:32,376 --> 01:20:34,644
# My life is for living #

1197
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:38,704
# I'll spend mine giving you
all that I can #

1198
01:20:38,742 --> 01:20:41,392
# My heart and my hand #

1199
01:20:50,227 --> 01:20:55,277
# My life with you will
shine brighter than gold #

1200
01:20:55,313 --> 01:21:00,014
# Memories of heaven
for when I get old #

1201
01:21:00,049 --> 01:21:04,204
# Never again
will I wanna run away #

1202
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:08,646
# I didn't think that I could
ever feel this way #

1203
01:21:08,687 --> 01:21:11,174
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1204
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:13,417
# Together forever in love #

1205
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:18,503
# Together forever in love #

1206
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:22,658
# Together forever in love. #

1207
01:21:46,565 --> 01:21:48,125
# Open the door #

1208
01:21:48,164 --> 01:21:50,236
# Walk in behind her #

1209
01:21:50,276 --> 01:21:52,446
# Draw back your bow #

1210
01:21:52,484 --> 01:21:54,393
# Let it remind her #

1211
01:21:54,435 --> 01:21:56,409
# No one's around #

1212
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,424
# No need to fake it #

1213
01:21:58,466 --> 01:22:00,320
# She's not in love #

1214
01:22:00,353 --> 01:22:03,102
# How can she take it? #

1215
01:22:10,911 --> 01:22:12,798
# Give her the time #

1216
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:14,902
# She'll know you mean it #

1217
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:16,851
# Make up her mind #

1218
01:22:16,893 --> 01:22:19,096
# Throw in her feelings #

1219
01:22:19,133 --> 01:22:21,074
# Open the door #

1220
01:22:21,116 --> 01:22:23,188
# Have her jump through it #

1221
01:22:23,228 --> 01:22:25,169
# She fell in love #

1222
01:22:25,211 --> 01:22:27,185
# How could she do it? #

1223
01:22:27,227 --> 01:22:30,193
# Do you know,
do you know #

1224
01:22:30,234 --> 01:22:32,535
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1225
01:22:32,569 --> 01:22:36,081
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1226
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:38,803
# Do you know,
do you know #

1227
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,327
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1228
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:44,978
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1229
01:22:45,014 --> 01:22:47,152
# You should try to kiss her #

1230
01:22:57,779 --> 01:22:59,502
# Crazy galore #

1231
01:22:59,538 --> 01:23:01,807
# You wouldn't do it #

1232
01:23:01,842 --> 01:23:03,697
# Seen it before #

1233
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:06,118
# Looks like you blew it #

1234
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:08,975
# Do you know,
do you know #

1235
01:23:09,008 --> 01:23:11,495
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1236
01:23:11,536 --> 01:23:14,797
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1237
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:17,765
# Do you know,
do you know #

1238
01:23:17,806 --> 01:23:20,195
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1239
01:23:20,237 --> 01:23:23,880
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1240
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:26,120
# You should try to kiss her #

1241
01:23:26,156 --> 01:23:29,057
# Do you know,
do you know #

1242
01:23:29,099 --> 01:23:31,487
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1243
01:23:31,531 --> 01:23:35,207
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1244
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:38,023
# Do you know,
do you know #

1245
01:23:38,057 --> 01:23:40,512
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1246
01:23:40,552 --> 01:23:44,163
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1247
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:46,403
# You should try to kiss her #

1248
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:48,773
# Just put up your fister #

1249
01:23:48,806 --> 01:23:54,555
# You should try
to kiss her goodbye. #

1250
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:05,824
# Swish with me #

1251
01:24:05,858 --> 01:24:08,093
# And I'll swish with you #

1252
01:24:10,081 --> 01:24:12,830
# That's right, get down #

1253
01:24:12,864 --> 01:24:14,358
# Everybody swish to the left #

1254
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:16,471
# That's right, get down... #
