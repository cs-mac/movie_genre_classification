Let's go, girls!
You look hot.

00:02:57,486 --> 00:03:01,489
The bunk 5 boys are gonna freak out
when they see you at kick ball. Let's go.

21
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,626
Ow!

22
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,137
All right, let's go.

23
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:48,024
Good morning, everybody.

24
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,234
Well, it's the last day of camp...

25
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:53,278
And it will be sad to shut down
wcfw for the summer.

26
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:56,781
But not to worry, because those of you in
the bethesda/chevy chase area...

27
00:03:57,281 --> 00:04:01,785
Can hear me all winter long on Jewish day
school radio 89.9 f.M...

28
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,786
"The fox."

29
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,747
For those select few of you
who went all summer,

30
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,791
all eight weeks without finding
that special someone,

31
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,751
today is your day, 'cause you
don't wanna go back home...

32
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:16,296
And lie to your friends about a summer
romance that didn't even happen.

33
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,756
And you don't want to be
the one person...

34
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,801
Who doesn't have anyone to kiss tonight
after the talent show.

35
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,554
So, seize the day, camp firewood,
because it's your last.

36
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,336
Coop, do you like watching
me and Andy make out?

37
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,797
No. What a weird thing to say.

38
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,342
- You look so sexy in this sweatshirt.
- Uh-huh.

39
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,302
- Your ass is so hot.
- Stop it!

40
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:20,595
- Do you want to be my boyfriend?
- No.

41
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:24,098
I get it. It's very funny. Stop.

42
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,102
Oh, Coop, you know I'm just kidding.

43
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:33,105
I know, and it's very, very funny.

44
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,065
Okay. I'm sorry.

45
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:39,568
- Want me to make it up to you?
- No, you've done enough already.

46
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,863
- I'm gonna find you a woman today.
- Honestly, don't worry about it.

47
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:48,074
No. And I'm not gonna rest until
my mission is accomplished, okay?

48
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:53,745
Okay. Then I'll cancel that
order of onions and limburger
cheese I made for lunch today.

49
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,497
- Ha-ha.
- Yeah.

50
00:05:57,498 --> 00:06:02,252
- I want you inside me.
- What?

51
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:04,879
Hey, what's up? I was just...

52
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:06,505
From before.

53
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:15,095
Coop, were you just talking to Katie?
What was that?

54
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:19,640
That was, bar none, the
longest conversation I've had
with her in six years of camp.

55
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:22,642
Does she want to fuck me? Is that
what she was asking you about?

56
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:25,103
Because, tell her that I will. In fact...

57
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:27,605
No, don't tell her that I will.
Tell her that I might.

58
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:30,148
Victor, I hate to break it to you,
but your name didn't even come up.

59
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,108
She definitely wants to fuck me.

60
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,152
Why else would she be talking to you?

61
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:37,654
- No offense.
- None taken.

62
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,282
Hello. Hi.

63
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:44,868
- Uh, hi.
- Hi. I'm Beth.

64
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,911
Nice to meet you. I'm Henry.

65
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,788
I've been seeing you around, so I thought
I'd take a chance...

66
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,415
And introduce myself.

67
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,299
- Thank you.
- So...

68
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,677
So, you work at the camp?

69
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,804
- I'm the camp director.
How about yourself? - Me?

70
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,014
- I don't work over there.
- No, I know.

71
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:15,683
I'm the director. I would know...

72
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:18,310
- If you were...
- Right. You would know that.

73
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,689
I teach astrophysics over at the
college in the school year.

74
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,191
And I came here this summer
just to, you know,

75
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:28,193
relax and reflect.

76
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:31,445
Wow! You're a Professor.
What do you teach?

77
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:33,947
Well, like I said before, astrophysics.

78
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:39,451
I study space, stars, comets
and that kind of thing.

79
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:42,287
"Space...
The final frontier."

80
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,080
Right. Thanks for everything.

81
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,332
Hey! You know what?
It would be a great idea...

82
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:53,212
If you came by the camp and
taught the campers about space.

83
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:56,089
- No, I couldn't...
- They'd love it.

84
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,090
No, I couldn't possibly.

85
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:01,093
- It would be just...
- I said no!

86
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,219
Sorry. That was...

87
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,691
Oh, Coop. Look at Abby.

88
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,734
Oh, she wants to fuck me.
So help me God.

89
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:25,194
She wants to fuck me.

90
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:27,238
And this time, Victor, I'm sure it's true.

91
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:32,242
I have to admit. Abby Bernstein
is one of the only Berry bushes...

92
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:34,702
That I have yet to pollinate,
if you get my meaning.

93
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:37,746
You mean, she's the only girl at camp
you haven't done it with yet?

94
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:39,706
That's exactly what I mean.

95
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:42,249
Hey, gene. Any mashed potatoes?

96
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:49,255
Gary! Bring out the taters!

97
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:53,216
Here they are. Hey, Gary.

98
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:55,760
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Hey, guys.

99
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,720
What'd you say, shithead?

100
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:02,223
I said, "hey, guys."
What's your glitz, gene?

101
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:05,767
Listen to me, you fucked-up little
cigarette-smoking piece of shit.

102
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:08,269
I was in the Vietnam war.

103
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,729
- I know.
- Oh, yeah.

104
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:14,774
The 'nam.

105
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:16,901
Excuse me, ladies. You
may remember me...

106
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:21,404
As the guy who came to dinner a few
weeks ago with underwear on my head.

107
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,489
My name is Keith stack.

108
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:27,534
From millburn, New Jersey.
State bird: The mosquito.

109
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:30,661
And as you may have heard,
I am recently...

110
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,163
A crowned class-b dungeon master.

111
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:36,666
So if any of you would like
to play "d & d" today,

112
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,669
please speak now or
forever hold your peace.

113
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,421
Anyone?

114
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:48,258
Alexa, maybe you'd like to join in?

115
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,302
We do need a druid, and
you have definitely cast...

116
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:53,845
A level-five charm spell on me.

117
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:56,306
In your dreams, douche bag.

118
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,809
Douche bags are hygienic products.
I take that as a compliment.

119
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,061
- Thank you.
- Ewww! Ewww!

120
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:16,571
Well, we made it to the end
of the summer in one piece,

121
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:19,574
except for a few campers who are lepers.

122
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:21,575
Good one, Beth.

123
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:26,079
Thank you, gene.

124
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:36,336
Excuse me. Could you tell me where
I could find the, uh...

125
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:41,340
How do I put this?
The, uh, Sci-Fi,

126
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:44,343
nerdy, indoor kids?

127
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:47,345
- Bunk 3.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

128
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:55,351
Hey, guys.

129
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:58,353
I'm associate Professor neumann.

130
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:01,374
Who'd like to spend the last day at camp
doing science projects?

131
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:07,110
Okay, okay. Okay, cool.

132
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:16,367
I've seen more fucked-up shit happen
in five minutes out there...

133
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,827
Than you'll see in your whole fucking life.

134
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:22,622
Gene, I'm really sorry, you know.
If I could change history, I would.

135
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:26,375
Fuck you! We need to make eight gallons
of bug juice by snack hour.

136
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,377
Do you know where
the powder packets are?

137
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:33,380
In the pantry over the sink, right
next to my bottle of dick cream!

138
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:35,382
Wait.

139
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:38,384
Ignore that last comment.

140
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:40,385
- Did you say dick cream?
- No.

141
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:42,887
I said stick team.

142
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:45,890
You know, stickball? Forget about it.
Go away! Leave me alone.

143
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:50,393
I'm pretty sure he said
dick cream, but...

144
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:52,895
Victor.

145
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:56,898
I need you and Neil to take the eagles out
on moose river. I made them a promise.

146
00:11:57,398 --> 00:11:59,900
It's the last day of camp.
It's not gonna work for me.

147
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:01,860
- It's not gonna work for you?
- No.

148
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:05,530
It's not gonna work for you. Okay,
how about this as a compromise?

149
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:08,824
The eagles are going to
go out on moose river...

150
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:12,035
- And you and Neil are
going to take them. - What?

151
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:15,036
Everybody focus up. All eyes here.

152
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:18,039
I would like to announce that
Ben and I are planning to
produce a musical number...

153
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:21,333
From godspell for the talent show tonight.

154
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,543
I'm sorry. Ben is producing, I am
directing/choreographing.

155
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,546
I'm speaking from personal experience,
but if you can't carry a tune...

156
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:30,047
Don't come to the audition
and waste our time.

157
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,550
- We're serious.
- And bring a lot of movement clothes,

158
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:36,553
a.K.A. Jazz shoes,
dance belts, lycras, et Al.

159
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:38,554
And seriously, f.Y.I., you guys,

160
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:41,557
this is not an excuse to get out
of your regular activities.

161
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,559
This is an excuse to do
some good musical theater.

162
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:47,060
So, be prepared, be enthusiastic...

163
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:50,564
And leave your bullshit
attitude and baggage at the
door, 'cause we don't need it!

164
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,566
Hey, you guys!

165
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:57,444
Oh, I was thinking maybe
we could take a walk later,

166
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,447
maybe go out to gunner's pass
one last time.

167
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,407
Goddamn it, Katie! You're suffocating me!

168
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,409
I'm chokin', all right?
Give me some breathing room.

169
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,454
I just want to spend some time with you.
It's our last day at camp.

170
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,747
- My butt itches.
- What are you talking about?

171
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:15,917
- We're soul mates, right?
- What? Yeah.

172
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,962
Whatever, if you want.
J.J., save me a waffle, man.

173
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:22,422
Andy, I'm serious. Come on.

174
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:25,966
I just want it to be special.
Fuck you, dyke!

175
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:29,469
- Why are you being such an asshole?
- I gotta finish my breakfast.

176
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:32,971
I love you, baby. So good talking to you.

177
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,475
Yeah, see you in macrame.

178
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:49,234
One last, successful b.K.F.S.T...

179
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:52,195
Becomes one for the record books.

180
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:55,239
And with t-minus 11 hours
to the big talent show,

181
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,282
we sail on aboard
the good ship firewood...

182
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:01,243
Toward a little oasis
that I like to call...

183
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:04,704
Morning activity time.

184
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,706
What's going on with Silas?

185
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:09,874
You didn't hear? He got kicked
out of camp. - Why?

186
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,753
He snuck into the office and videotaped
himself jerking off. - You're kidding!

187
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,504
- Where's the tape?
- He hid it.

188
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:21,008
- We gotta get that tape. - It's
a subject matter I'm sure
you're familiar with, McKinley.

189
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,800
- Shut up, j.J.
- You shut up.

190
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:24,678
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

191
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,897
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

192
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:42,400
And one, and one.
Step aside. Step aside.

193
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,786
All right. Stop it!

194
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:03,040
Okay, kids. Um, today
we're going to use...

195
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:06,043
Some crayons...

196
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:09,420
To make some decorations
for the talent show.

197
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:17,426
- Is that your wedding ring, Gail?
- Um, no.

198
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:21,054
I mean, yes, actually.
Yes, it is. It was.

199
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:24,182
It was. It used to be,
I mean, legally.

200
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:28,435
It's so twisted. His lawyer
won't even call me now.

201
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,937
- Where are the crayons?
- The crayons are...

202
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:34,815
The crayon is right there.

203
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,567
We could draw with the markers.

204
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:40,569
Listen, Valerie,

205
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,029
I need you to be
helpful here, okay?

206
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:46,073
I do not need you
to undermine me, okay?

207
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:49,326
But there's only one crayon,
and it's brown.

208
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,078
There are literally hundreds
of colored markers.

209
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,840
Hey.

210
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,343
Going on your trip?

211
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:13,969
Yep.

212
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,472
Sucks dick we never got
to know each other.

213
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:18,723
Yeah.

214
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,600
You got a stick of gum, Victor?

215
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,102
I thought you'd never ask.

216
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,493
Abby! My trip...
It doesn't come back until tomorrow.

217
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,495
- Don't go.
- I can't, because Beth told me...

218
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:53,083
Let's go.

219
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:57,378
♪ Get ready get set, baby ♪
I'll be back tonight.

220
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:00,005
♪ Leaving tomorrow
so get ready ♪

221
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:04,508
♪ get ready get set, baby ♪
tonight.

222
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,509
Ah!

223
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,512
This is "the beekeeper" here
on camp firewood radio.

224
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:15,141
I've got my drones working hard
on a breakfast time rock... hey.

225
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:19,144
- Arty, I need you to take a shower.
- Okay.

226
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:22,647
Your parents are coming tomorrow.
I don't want to get in trouble.

227
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,649
- Sure. - You haven't taken a
shower once yet this summer.

228
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:29,652
- Fine. No problem.
- Arty, take a shower.

229
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:32,154
You're covered in dirt.

230
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:34,156
Fine.

231
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:38,534
This is arty Solomon here.

232
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,869
Alias, "the beekeeper."

233
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:45,915
- You guys,
I'm really gonna miss this place. - Me too.

234
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:51,669
Hey, let's all promise that in ten years
from today we'll meet again...

235
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,421
And we'll see what kind of people
we've blossomed into.

236
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:56,381
- Yeah!
- What time you wanna meet?

237
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,925
- You mean ten years from now?
- Yeah.

238
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,177
Let's meet in the morning
so we can make a day of it.

239
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:03,969
Okay, so what is it?
Is it like 9:00 or 9:30?

240
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,681
Let's say 9:00, that way
we can be here by 9:30.

241
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:09,057
Why don't we say 9:30,

242
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:11,560
and then make it your
beeswax to be here at 9:30?

243
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,063
We're gonna be in our late
20's. I don't see any reason
we can't be places on time.

244
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:19,190
Okay, it's settled.
9:30 it is.

245
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:22,151
- All agreed?
- Agreed.

246
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:25,153
Great, 'cause I have
something at 11:00.

247
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:28,156
You've got a trapper keeper
full of appointments, right?

248
00:18:28,197 --> 00:18:31,700
No, I have something at 11:00 that I can't
change 'cause I already moved it twice.

249
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,829
What are you looking at?

250
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,831
Is there a u.F.O. In the sky?

251
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:44,835
No, no. It's nothing
you need worry about...

252
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,840
Yet.

253
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:01,222
Andy? Are you
gonna clean that up?

254
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:03,683
Oh, yeah, I will.

255
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:07,185
Uh, I just got...
I don't have time now.

256
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:10,354
Clean it up and come
to my office for the meeting.

257
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:12,856
I gotta...

258
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:44,005
Damn!

259
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:07,148
- Gail, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

260
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,152
It's just that my husband Ron...

261
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:14,695
You know...
No, he's my ex-husband.

262
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:17,156
I guess I have
to get used to that.

263
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:20,158
I have to get used
to saying ex, ex, ex.

264
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:23,910
He's my ex, ex-husband.

265
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:28,414
You know, it's just
that I thought, like...

266
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:31,917
When Jonas and I separated,
I thought everything was lost.

267
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,667
And then I met Ron...

268
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:39,172
And it just seemed like everything
was gonna work out, you know?

269
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:43,050
Keep going. We're with you.
I'm a total wreck! I don't even
know where the crayons are.

270
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:47,929
- I know, I know. Gail, listen to me.
- I'm a loser. What?

271
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:52,433
- Ron's who he is and you
can't change that. - I know.

272
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,433
Okay?

273
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,186
- Gail, listen to me. Look at me.
- I am.

274
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:59,938
Gail, look at me.
Gail, look at me.

275
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,440
I want you to say "okay."

276
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:05,943
- Why?
- I want you to say "okay."

277
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:10,946
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

278
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:13,198
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank you all...

279
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,200
For making the last eight weeks,

280
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,202
without rival, the best summer
of my entire life.

281
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,539
Okay, let's get to business.

282
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,583
Coop, the camp goat
took a shit in the infirmary.

283
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,085
- I need you to take care of that, please.
- That's impossible!

284
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:32,046
It is possible, and it happened...
On my shoes.

285
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:35,591
Abby, bunk 8 wants to watch the China
syndrome again, so run the betamax.

286
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:39,052
- Again?
- What can I say? They love it. McKinley.

287
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:42,971
Four lower campers are stuck in the ropes
course. I meant to tell you yesterday.

288
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:46,349
Could you get to it now?
And last, but certainly not least,

289
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,226
tonight is the big talent show.

290
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,103
We have a lot of hard work ahead of us.
A few ground rules...

291
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,980
Hey. Hey!

292
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,483
I'm serious here.
I am not joking around.

293
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:02,486
I am not jok... I am not
Ruth buzzi standing here.

294
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:05,363
I am no Ruth buzzi standing here!

295
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:13,119
Steve? What you got there?

296
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,372
I have been programmed...

297
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:19,332
By my galactic master...

298
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:21,376
Not to talk to earth denizens...

299
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:25,629
Of classifications j.J.
And McKinley-I-zoid.

300
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:33,510
- Your brother is such a freak.
- I know.

301
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,012
Katie, you're hot, right?

302
00:22:36,512 --> 00:22:40,515
By all accounts, you would be considered
"hot." Is that correct?

303
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:42,517
Uh, I suppose so.

304
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:48,521
So if one wanted to be hot and make
a good impression, what would you wear?

305
00:22:48,563 --> 00:22:51,023
You put on a clean pair of pants?

306
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:54,526
Beth, come on. Pants?
Are you kidding?

307
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:57,028
Yes. Pants.

308
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:59,028
Of course I'm kidding.

309
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:02,032
You didn't get I'm kidding?
Unless you're kidding.

310
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:06,535
'Cause pants, Katie.
Come on, please. Pants.

311
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:09,037
So would you... slacks? Pants?

312
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:12,540
I don't know. I think I'd wear
a sexy dress or something.

313
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,042
That? Oh, you're good.
Sexy dress.

314
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:18,043
Okay. Uh, that's "a."

315
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:22,547
Um, what else... what else
would one do if one were...

316
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:25,549
I'd do my hair.
Oh, get out of town!

317
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,553
I'm not getting out of town, and I'm
serious. And I'd use a little mousse.

318
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:33,556
Moose, as in...

319
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:36,808
No, as "mousse" for your hair.
Right! Right!

320
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:40,186
- Okay. Wait a minute, Beth. Are you...
- What?

321
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:42,438
Huh? What's up?

322
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:46,314
You dog! You have
a crush on somebody!

323
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:50,694
- I do have a crush. I just don't
believe he's interested. - What?

324
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:55,072
Beth, do not worry. Come with me
and I will mousse you up.

325
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:04,204
Hey, Andy, can I take out the
motorboat and drive around the lake?

326
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:08,207
- Sure.
- Wow! Thanks.

327
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:13,211
Just make sure you fill it up with gas
when you're done, and watch out...

328
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:15,213
Yeah, whatever.

329
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:25,220
Man, I'd give anything for two
minutes in the closet with Lindsay.

330
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:30,724
- What about Katie?
- Who?

331
00:24:31,225 --> 00:24:33,226
Excellent.

332
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,988
Hey. Whatcha writin' on?

333
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,948
My "gurnal."

334
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,492
I write my thoughts in it every day.

335
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,494
Oh, you mean a journal.

336
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,454
Yeah, whatever.

337
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,998
Guess I'm not all smart like you.

338
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,458
Can I see what you're writing?

339
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,003
Only three people are allowed to
look at this... me, myself and I.

340
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:10,004
But I want you to share it with me.

341
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,008
Hey!

342
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:21,763
Let's see. Debbie waxman?

343
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:25,767
No. She makes that weird piggy
face when she talks, you know?

344
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:29,770
Yeah. Okay, good. No piggy face.

345
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:34,231
- Rachel Schwartz.
- No.

346
00:25:34,273 --> 00:25:37,275
- Come on, she's a slut. She'll go.
- I'll pass.

347
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:40,236
- Yeah, you're not really a slut type.
- Yes, I am.

348
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:44,281
I love sluts. Sluts rock.
It's just gotta be the right slut.

349
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:46,658
What about susie?

350
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:51,495
Yeah. I could go for susie.

351
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:53,788
She and I went out
my first summer here.

352
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,040
- When you were ten?
- Yeah, we were ten,

353
00:25:56,165 --> 00:25:58,166
but we were into
some heavy shit.

354
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,293
Did you go all the way?

355
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:03,796
You bet we went all the way.
We went all the way back too.

356
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:06,256
We did doggy style, pony style.

357
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:10,175
Style council. That's a good band.
They're hot now. Human league.

358
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:12,676
They have some good stuff.

359
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:16,180
League of nations. That brings in
the whole thing of united nations.

360
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,932
That brings in the whole
category of countries.

361
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:22,434
Where to start?
Well, the obvious one.

362
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:26,938
The birthplace of spaghetti and
pasta, all the oily stuff... Italy.

363
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:29,690
- Now you go.
- Um...

364
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:33,193
- How about Italy?
- Yeah, good! It's safe.

365
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:36,195
I kind of paved the way
with that one, but...

366
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,199
What?

367
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,701
- What?
- Hey, guys.

368
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,329
- Hi, Nancy.
- Hi, Katie.

369
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:49,330
Coop, goat shit.

370
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:58,963
Whoo-hoo! Ow!

371
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:10,597
Andy! Help me!

372
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:12,723
- You French great.
- Andy!

373
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:17,227
- You're not so bad yourself, Mr. man.
- Andy, help me!

374
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:21,230
- I can't swim!
- Cut it out, Bobby. You're fine.

375
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,607
For chrissake, Andy,
help me, I'm drowning.

376
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,864
No, you can't hear the ocean, but you
can learn a great deal about our world.

377
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:38,493
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Beth.

378
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:41,579
Like the new look. Tres chic.

379
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,623
- Thank you, Henry.
- Please, call me Henry.

380
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,624
Okay, Henry it is.

381
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,127
I see you decided to come
teach the campers, Henry.

382
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,129
Yeah. I'm sorry
I snapped at you before.

383
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,590
I'm a little shy around children.
But it's been great!

384
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:59,634
I've got them making miniature
black holes with paper clips and soot.

385
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:02,595
What you do is so fascinating!

386
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:06,640
- You really like astrophysics? - I love
it! It's my biggest hobby. I love it.

387
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:11,643
Really? Okay. Who's your
favorite astrophysicist?

388
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:15,146
My fav... I totally know this one.

389
00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:17,148
Okay, any...

390
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:24,153
- What time is it?
- Um...

391
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:26,113
9:00, 9:30.

392
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:30,158
I'm so late. I have to go
meet Jim... stansel.

393
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:33,160
- You know Jim? He's that guy.
- Uh-huh.

394
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,663
- So I'll talk to you later. Okay?
- Okay.

395
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:39,665
Okay. Okay. Later, then.

396
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:47,296
Andy, have you seen
my swimming buddy?

397
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,296
Um...
If I can't find him,

398
00:28:49,297 --> 00:28:51,799
I'm telling Beth
that you let him drown.

399
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,802
- I was busy. - It's your job to
make sure kids don't drown.

400
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:57,804
Lindsay, I need like
20 minutes, all right?

401
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,806
Gotta talk to this kid.

402
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,308
Andy, where are we going?

403
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,309
To a big, secret pizza party.

404
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,187
Wow! Cool. I love pizza.

405
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:11,189
Yeah, well...

406
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:19,070
Nancy! Hello.

407
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:23,573
If I was looking for a book on
astrophysics, where would I find one?

408
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:26,951
Off the top of my head,
I'd have to say a bookstore.

409
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:29,577
- Or a library.
- Right.

410
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:31,579
Just curious. Keep up the good work.

411
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,331
Okay.

412
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,418
Excuse me. Uh, Nancy.

413
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,837
Say I wanted to get a book on, um...

414
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,213
What?

415
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:47,216
- Camp directing, I guess. Would that be...
- Henry.

416
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:49,969
Henry! Library.

417
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:54,555
Ooh. Thank you!

418
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:58,600
Beth! Beth!

419
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:02,103
If you're going into town, can you pick
me up something at the drugstore?

420
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:06,481
Beth, come on. My husband's coming
today and I need some lube.

421
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:08,483
For my pussy.

422
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:13,945
Oh, cool!

423
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:17,490
Beth's going into town.
Let's go! Wait, wait!

424
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:24,370
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

425
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:26,997
Come on, Coop!
Come on!

426
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:35,754
Whoo!

427
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:38,255

Hey, guys, how was waterville?

447
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:22,835
- It was really fun. - It's always fun
to get away from camp,

448
00:32:23,336 --> 00:32:25,337
even for an hour.

449
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:29,591
Katie!
I'll see you later maybe?

450
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:32,343
Definitely.

451
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,472
Guys, wait up!

452
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:47,563
How far away
is this goddamn river?

453
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:51,107
It's at least two hours, Vic.
Try to forget about Abby.

454
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:54,109
I can't, Neil, okay?
This is my only chance.

455
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,111
What are you talking about?

456
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:59,451
I'm gonna tell you something, but I
swear to God, if you tell anybody...

457
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:02,866
- I swear to God!
- What? Wha...

458
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:08,871
- I'm a virgin.
- Wha...

459
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,831
You're joking.
Right, dude?

460
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:15,876
You're the stallion. You've had
like 50 or 60 women, so I mean...

461
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:19,879
Actually, it's closer to... zero.

462
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,840
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

463
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:25,884
You're a loser.
You are a loser!

464
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:28,676
Oh, my God. Don't. I...

465
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:31,388
You're such a loser.

466
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,063
- What?
- What?

467
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,107
You listen to me,
Mr. kickass.

468
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,608
Mr. rubber burner.

469
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,111
You wipe that hotshot grin off
your face or I'll shoot it off you.

470
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:52,612
You got that? Now finish up them taters.

471
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:55,365
- I'm gonna go fondle my sweaters.
- Come on. What?

472
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:57,615
- Finish up the taters.
- Then what did you say?

473
00:33:57,616 --> 00:34:00,619
- Then what did I say? - You said you
were gonna go fondle your sweaters.

474
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,620
I... no, I didn't.

475
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,621
I said I'm gonna
fondue with cheddar.

476
00:34:05,622 --> 00:34:08,124
I was thinking about making fondue with
cheddar cheese for dinner tonight.

477
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:12,252
- No, gene, that is not what you said.
- It is what I said.

478
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:14,754
Fondue with cheddar.

479
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:16,756
Okay, fine.

480
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,385
Okay, see you later.

481
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,346
See ya.

482
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:28,390
I'm just gonna stop by
my bunk for a real quick sec.

483
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:33,894
Maybe you should talk to him.

484
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:39,023
So rabbi rothstein says, "SIM, SIM,
SIM, SIM, ata..."

485
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:41,483
Hey, McKinley.

486
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:44,527
- Did you take that shower yet?
- Yeah, of course.

487
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,070
- Did you?
- No.

488
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:49,531
Take a shower.

489
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:55,035
Sorry, folks for the
"coitus interuptus," if you will.

490
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,661
I know you're all hungry
for the picnic,

491
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,164
so don't eat too many
barbecued bovine muscles.

492
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:02,666
Those being hamburgers.
Thank you.

493
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:09,922
Gail, if I could just
interject something here.

494
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:14,300
This is gonna sound like
I'm putting down my own gender,

495
00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:18,553
but the truth is, a lot of the time
men can be real...

496
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:21,555
And excuse the yiddish...
Insensitive schmucks.

497
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:24,308
- It's true.
- I know.

498
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:28,811
I know. It's just that
I'm 34 years old.

499
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:30,686
You know?

500
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:34,190
I'm just afraid I'm never
gonna meet anybody.

501
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,692
- Shh. Just breathe. Shh.
- It's so sad.

502
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:42,697
Breathe. Shh.
Just breathe.

503
00:35:42,738 --> 00:35:45,490
Oh, God!

504
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:48,201
Your hands are magic.

505
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:51,328
- There you go.
- You, my friend, are a magician.

506
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,917
Okay!

507
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:02,462
Everyone! Immediately!
Out of the van.

508
00:36:02,503 --> 00:36:04,964
Get out of the van.
Out. Out.

509
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,306
- What are you doing?
- I'm going back to camp.

510
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,427
- I'll come back in the morning and
pick you up. - Wait a second.

511
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:15,722
- What, Neil? - Wait a minute.
You can't get there and back by sunup.

512
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:19,725
I am going to be with Abby
Bernstein tonight. And if you
don't like it, you know what?

513
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:23,228
You could just go ahead
and fuck yourself!

514
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:24,979
Hey!

515
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:32,360

559
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,282
Debbie Epstein has,
like, playboy titties!

560
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:04,021
- It's just like klute! - Holy shit,
you guys! Look, look, look.

561
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:08,024
Bend over, yes. Take 'em off,
take 'em off. Yes! Yes!

562
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:11,527
Guys, I'm gonna catch up
with you later, okay?

563
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:15,989
Dude, that's kind of sad.

564
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:19,533
He gets so uncomfortable whenever
we talk openly about sexual issues.

565
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:21,993
You know, he's never
been with a girl before.

566
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:24,412
McKinley needs
to experience the ultimate.

567
00:40:24,537 --> 00:40:26,098
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

568
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:28,540
You mean penis in vagina?

569
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:31,000
No, dickhead. Sex.

570
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:34,044
Oh, oh, oh.

571
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,673
They're total
nymphos! Throw the ball!

572
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:41,133
Yes!

573
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:45,053
I'm sure we can convince one of the
girls from bunk 10 to boink McKinley.

574
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:48,013
They're really horny this summer.

575
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:50,682
Where did he go, anyway?
- I don't know.

576
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,684
- Probably went to write his mommy
and daddy a letter. - What a fag!

577
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:56,687
- Who are we gonna set him up with?
- How about Debbie?

578
00:40:56,728 --> 00:40:58,730
- No, she's got mono.
- Right.

579
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:00,648
- How about Debbie?
- Who?

580
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,693
- You know, Debbie Debbie.
- Oh, Debbie Debbie. No, she's his cousin.

581
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:08,696
- How about tall Debbie?
- Too tall.

582
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:12,449
How about Debbie
Freeman? She's in heat!

583
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:15,951
- She wants to French. - No, you
shithead. She wants to get boned.

584
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:18,787
- Then I want her.
- You're being ridiculous.

585
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:21,331
I'm not being ridiculous!
I'm just saying I want her.

586
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:23,290
This isn't about you.
This is about McKinley.

587
00:41:23,332 --> 00:41:27,335
Haven't you been listening to
what we've been saying? We're
trying to get our friend laid.

588
00:41:27,377 --> 00:41:31,839
- Ah! Point taken.
- Okay. Tonight...

589
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,841
- Get McKinley laid.
- Come hell or high water?

590
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,801
Secret handshake?

591
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:39,344
Get McKinley laid!

592
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,238
As everybody knows,

593
00:42:03,738 --> 00:42:08,367
today is the big culminating,
climactic softball game...

594
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:11,869
- Against evil camp tiger claw.
- Boo!

595
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,371
We have put together
an unlikely...

596
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:18,124
Team of misfits, and we've been
training like crazy all summer.

597
00:42:18,624 --> 00:42:21,126
Yeah, it's a motley crew
that you'd think...

598
00:42:21,627 --> 00:42:23,228
Would never be able
to win a single game.

599
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:26,630
We had a kooky training period
where it seemed like...

600
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,633
It seemed like nothing was
gonna go right. But, guys,

601
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,718
somehow we made it
to the finals.

602
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:36,138
So I say, when those anonymously
evil campers from tiger claw get here,

603
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:40,141
we give it our best shot, and we try to
come from behind at the last minute...

604
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,143
With some weird trick play that we
made up and we win the game.

605
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,645
What do you say, team?

606
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,396
It sounds like
well-worn territory.

607
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:50,098
The whole thing feels kind of
trite. I say we forget it.

608
00:42:50,148 --> 00:42:52,650
- Is that how everybody feels?
- Yeah.

609
00:42:52,692 --> 00:42:54,402
Well, it's fine with me.

610
00:43:05,911 --> 00:43:09,413
So listen, they just
aren't into it. It's kind of trite.

611
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:11,915
Yeah, you're right. No problem, man.

612
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:14,917
It's sort of hackneyed. Tried
and done before.

613
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,919
See you later, man.

614
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:23,424
It's no big deal.
They were totally cool.

615
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:25,425
Okay? All right.

616
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:35,183
Susie is gonna score
with McKinley.

617
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:38,185
Then he's gonna need some
eyewitnesses for verification.

618
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,811
Let's go!

619
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:50,028
Why does she still
have her clothes on?

620
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:53,822
- Looks like she's playing the flute.
- Oh, wow. Kinky.

621
00:43:58,451 --> 00:44:00,911
As bared witness by myself,

622
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:05,456
all of camp firewood and the higher
power, however you define it,

623
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:08,834
I hereby consecrate
and sanctify the union...

624
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:11,544
Of McKinley and Ben.

625
00:44:11,586 --> 00:44:14,838
May their majestic
and blessed love...

626
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,091
Flourish all the days
of their lives.

627
00:44:19,592 --> 00:44:21,593
- Amen.
- Amen.

628
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:23,470
Amen.

629
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:29,850
McKinley's a fag.

630
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,853
- McKinley's a fag with Ben!
- What are we gonna do?

631
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:37,439
Capture the flag!

632
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:53,076
Hey, aren't you
gonna eat anything?

633
00:44:53,576 --> 00:44:55,077
I'm not hungry.

634
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:01,082
So, you haven't made many
friends this summer, have you?

635
00:45:01,124 --> 00:45:03,542
No, I have not.

636
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:07,462
- Let's drop the robot voice, shall we?
- Okay.

637
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:11,465
- This your first summer here?
- Fifth. You were my counselor...

638
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,550
- Three times.
- Now I'm the camp director.

639
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:17,094
If there's anything I can do to make your
last day more enjoyable, let me know.

640
00:45:17,136 --> 00:45:19,054
Really?

641
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:22,598
I have an idea. How about
whatever you've been working
on is your talent tonight?

642
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,559
That way, the other campers
can get to know you.

643
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:29,479
- It's not a song or anything. - It's
okay. I'll have susie put you on the list.

644
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:32,481
Oh, God! Thank you!

645
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,859
- How was the waterfront this morning?
- It was good.

646
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,237
We gonna get a chance
to spend time together?

647
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,114
Are you gonna pound this
into my face all day?

648
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:45,574
Sorry.

649
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:48,577
Apology accepted.

650
00:45:48,618 --> 00:45:52,121
Guess what. A bunch of us went into town
and got ice cream and hamburgers...

651
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:54,122
It smells like the ribs are ready.

652
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:02,337
Beth, I may regret saying this,

653
00:46:02,379 --> 00:46:07,383
- but how dare you usurp my authority
as producer... - Hmpf!

654
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:09,384
Director/choreographer
of the talent show?

655
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:12,386
You were wrong to do that!

656
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:14,972
I have been busting
my balls, woman!

657
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:18,016
I am telling you,
the musical numbers are a mess,

658
00:46:18,516 --> 00:46:20,976
my kids are a bunch of amateurs,

659
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:24,271
and the last thing I need today
is some diabetic freak...

660
00:46:24,312 --> 00:46:27,523
Prancing around on stage
making my life a living hell!

661
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:32,152
All right, I'll put him last.

662
00:46:32,402 --> 00:46:34,403
Good.

663
00:46:34,904 --> 00:46:36,905
Oh, she always wins!

664
00:46:38,907 --> 00:46:41,909
Don't pick it up, stupid!

665
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:44,744
Stop picking it up!

666
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:47,497
You see? This is us,

667
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:53,043
and we're traveling
around the sun.

668
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:59,047
That's a 1.3 million mile trip
every year!

669
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:01,507
Radical.

670
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:05,052
You might say that
each and every one of us...

671
00:47:05,093 --> 00:47:08,554
Is a crew member here
on spaceship earth.

672
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,557
- When would we say that?
- Any time.

673
00:47:11,598 --> 00:47:14,517
Dinner. Literally any time.

674
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,437
You're amazing. I hope I can come to your
college and you can be my Professor.

675
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:21,898
Actually, I, uh...

676
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,442
I'm just an associate Professor.

677
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:27,694
- What does that mean?
- Melvyn!

678
00:47:27,736 --> 00:47:29,696
No, no, it's all right.

679
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:32,197
It means, melvyn...

680
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,449
It means that I'm...

681
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:40,454
Less than.

682
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,961
Oh, God!

683
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:56,091
Hey! What's goin' on?

684
00:47:57,717 --> 00:48:00,219
Hey, Beth. We're just
having ourselves a little cry.

685
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:06,932
I know what this group needs.

686
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:09,976
How 'bout we grab some lunch and
watch the "capture the flag" game?

687
00:48:10,018 --> 00:48:13,854
- What do you say?
- I think we'll take a rain check, Beth.

688
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:18,358
- We're in the middle of some pretty
interesting stuff. - I'll make you a deal.

689
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:21,193
You come watch the "capture the
flag game" with the normal kids,

690
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,738
and then you can have the whole rest
of the day to learn about planets, stars,

691
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:28,240
pulsars, heliocentricity,
gravitational collapse...

692
00:48:28,616 --> 00:48:30,075
And the science
of celestial mechanics...

693
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:33,119
As shown through the work of
the 19th century scientists...

694
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:37,622
Alexis clairaut, Jean d'alembert
and Pierre laplace.

695
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,375
- Okay? Ready?
- Okay!

696
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,377
Break!

697
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:50,382
Gee, I was really impressed by some
of the stuff you said back there.

698
00:48:50,424 --> 00:48:54,844
- Oh, it was... - No, Beth, you
know what you're talking about.

699
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:56,887
I don't know where you find the
time to learn about astrophysics.

700
00:48:57,388 --> 00:49:00,890
I mean, with camp payroll
and insurance to deal with.

701
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:04,393
Keeping parents happy,
supervising a young staff.

702
00:49:04,435 --> 00:49:07,354
- Keeping everyone fed.
- Wow.

703
00:49:07,395 --> 00:49:11,398
It was in 1908 that the first
American summer camps
were founded in the catskills.

704
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,653
- Is there any more corn?
- What?

705
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:21,156
- More corn.
- Oh, dude.

706
00:49:21,197 --> 00:49:24,158
- You got...
- What, dude?

707
00:49:24,283 --> 00:49:26,785
What? What are you doing
with your hand?

708
00:49:26,827 --> 00:49:29,370
On your face. You, uh...

709
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:32,373
Cat got your tongue, Andy?
What is it?

710
00:49:32,414 --> 00:49:35,166
You have barbecue sauce
all over your face.

711
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:38,294
- I know that. So?
- It's pretty foul.

712
00:49:38,669 --> 00:49:44,173
It's just barbecue sauce.
Come on. I wanna make out.

713
00:49:46,675 --> 00:49:48,677
Okay, but not here.

714
00:49:55,182 --> 00:49:57,642
What's it like being a Professor?

715
00:49:57,684 --> 00:50:02,688
- What do they say, "publish or perish"?
- Well, perish mostly.

716
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:05,189
I'm up for tenure this fall.

717
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:08,192
If I don't make my mark soon,
I could end up out of work.

718
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:11,194
But you're so talented!

719
00:50:11,694 --> 00:50:13,696
Tell that to my Dean.

720
00:50:15,197 --> 00:50:18,700
Okay. Okay, what's his address?

721
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:21,660
You serious?
56 linden Lane.

722
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:25,288
- Okay. City?
- God, you're really... Augusta.

723
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,332
- State? - I can't believe...
Well, Maine, of course.

724
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:32,794
- Zip?
- This is... 04139.

725
00:50:32,836 --> 00:50:35,337
- Does he have an apartment number?
- No!

726
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:40,341
Beth, this is incredible. I don't
know how to thank you.

727
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:43,844
You already have, Henry.
You already have.

728
00:50:52,976 --> 00:50:56,479
This is crazy.
This is crazy.

729
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,572
That's it, Lars.

730
00:52:04,072 --> 00:52:06,074
Good. Keep your feet together.

731
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:07,700
You got it. Good.

732
00:52:10,952 --> 00:52:12,912
Aah!

733
00:52:12,954 --> 00:52:16,582
You taste like a burger.
I don't like you anymore.

734
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:20,334
Whatever!

735
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:28,174
Damn it!

736
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:30,842
Is it my turn yet?

737
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:45,604
So, this is where I come
when I want to think.

738
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:47,605
Wow!

739
00:52:48,106 --> 00:52:50,608
It's very...

740
00:52:50,649 --> 00:52:53,110
Barn-like.

741
00:52:57,613 --> 00:53:00,073
You know, it's weird, Coop.

742
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:03,618
I was supposed to be in the woods
with Andy this afternoon, but...

743
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:08,121
Oh. I'm sorry. We can go back.
We should go back.

744
00:53:08,163 --> 00:53:11,624
No, no! It's okay.
I can see him later.

745
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:20,631
Give me your hand.

746
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:27,719
It's cold.

747
00:53:27,761 --> 00:53:30,763
Yeah. I'm freezing.

748
00:53:31,264 --> 00:53:32,765
Do you want my sweatshirt?

749
00:53:32,807 --> 00:53:35,142
Do you mind?

750
00:53:50,654 --> 00:53:54,657
Okay, Coop, now I'm colder than
I was before when I said I was cold.

751
00:53:56,158 --> 00:53:58,660
Well, do you want my flannel?

752
00:54:00,161 --> 00:54:02,663
Yeah.

753
00:54:11,294 --> 00:54:15,297
This is cool! It's really a
great shirt. I love it.

754
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:18,300
It's my favorite shirt.

755
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,802
So... you're gonna have
to give it back.

756
00:54:21,844 --> 00:54:23,804
Now?

757
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:26,306
Yeah.

758
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:37,272
What are we doing?

759
00:54:37,314 --> 00:54:40,817
- Do you mean like switching our shirts?
- No.

760
00:54:41,317 --> 00:54:43,819
What are we doing?

761
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:45,821
I don't know.

762
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,838
Okay, so I'm Ron and I'm calling you.
Here we go. Ring, ring.

763
00:55:09,214 --> 00:55:11,215
Hello?
Hi, Gail.

764
00:55:11,257 --> 00:55:13,175
It's me, Ron.

765
00:55:13,217 --> 00:55:17,678
Hi, Ron. What do
you want? Um, well...

766
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,224
I'm ready to give our marriage
another shot. What do you say?

767
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:26,227
Um...

768
00:55:26,352 --> 00:55:28,353
Be strong, Gail!

769
00:55:28,478 --> 00:55:32,732
- No.
- No, Ron, it's over.

770
00:55:32,773 --> 00:55:36,985
Good-bye.

771
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:47,493
Hi, mom. Could you get dad?

772
00:55:47,535 --> 00:55:49,953
Just get him.

773
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:53,998
Hi, dad. Okay, are you
guys sitting down?

774
00:55:54,498 --> 00:55:57,500
I met somebody. Well, she's got
this other boyfriend,

775
00:55:57,542 --> 00:56:00,002
but, well, it's just a matter
of time, I think.

776
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:05,131
Her name is Katie,
and she's really great.

777
00:56:05,173 --> 00:56:08,092
And, um... what?
I don't think so.

778
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:11,094
She might be.
She's got a pretty big nose.

779
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:14,138
Well, I know how you guys worry that
I have trouble meeting girls.

780
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,598
And I'm just saying,
worry no more.

781
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,643
Well, I should get going.
She's probably looking for me.

782
00:56:20,685 --> 00:56:24,646
Okay, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.
Bye-bye.

783
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:29,108
This feels so good.

784
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,152
Maybe you shouldn't jump
the gun just yet, Coop.

785
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:35,530
Very good, very good.

786
00:56:35,571 --> 00:56:38,031
A-plus for comedy, Beth.

787
00:56:38,532 --> 00:56:41,034
Ruth buzzi better watch
her back.

788
00:56:41,075 --> 00:56:44,036
Beth!
"Jump the gun."

789
00:56:48,915 --> 00:56:51,792
♪ Day by day ♪

790
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:54,628
♪ day by day ♪

791
00:56:54,669 --> 00:57:00,048
Okay, stop! I feel like I'm watching
regional theater, you guys.

792
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:03,592
God, am I at the Cleveland
playhouse or something?

793
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:07,012
Your craft is a muscle!
You need to exercise it!

794
00:57:07,054 --> 00:57:10,431
Take a break! Think about
what you've done.

795
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:13,684
Gee, susie, have you
seen Katie anywhere?

796
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:16,144
No. Why?

797
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,437
No particular reason. But if you see her,
will you tell her I'm looking for her?

798
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:21,690
- Sure.
- Okay.

799
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:26,193
All right, with passion!

800
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,322
Katie! Are you in here?

801
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:32,948
Oh, hi.

802
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:36,451
Um, I want to talk
to you later, okay?

803
00:57:36,826 --> 00:57:39,829
Oh, yeah. Sure.

804
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:54,590
Dinner!

805
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,843
- Have you seen j.J. And Gary? Do you
know where they are? - Don't know.

806
00:57:57,884 --> 00:58:00,845
I'm a little worried they might have
found out about us. - Hey!

807
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:02,596
McKinley and Ben!

808
00:58:04,473 --> 00:58:07,350
This is for you.

809
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:13,354
It's a chaise lounge.

810
00:58:13,605 --> 00:58:17,107
We didn't know if maybe you
guys already had one. We
have the receipt if you do.

811
00:58:17,149 --> 00:58:19,567
No, we don't have one. Thank you!

812
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:22,111
It goes with the chenille throw
cloth Beth's sister gave us.

813
00:58:22,153 --> 00:58:25,822
Okay, everybody, attention.
I've got an announcement.

814
00:58:25,864 --> 00:58:28,384
I know you're all getting ready
for the big talent show tonight,

815
00:58:28,408 --> 00:58:31,909
but the following campers
need to put their trunks out...

816
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,371
So the early bus to Boston
can pick them up at 7:30 A.M.

817
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:40,416
Amanda klein, Jessica azaria,

818
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:45,379
ira stevenberg, sol zimmerstein,

819
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,258
uh, David... Ben gurion.

820
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,763
Cookin' slop for the grunts
in 'nam was easier than this.

821
00:58:56,804 --> 00:59:00,265
We had no place being over there.

822
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:02,225
It was a war we couldn't win, gene.

823
00:59:02,267 --> 00:59:07,271
Yeah, well I'm gonna go
smear some mud on my ass.

824
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:09,647
What?

825
00:59:10,148 --> 00:59:15,610
I said, "I hear
my bud's in class."

826
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,904
I gotta go and call my bud
and see how his grades are.

827
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:22,157
- I, I gotta go. Go away, leave
me alone. - Gene, hold on.

828
00:59:22,657 --> 00:59:27,161
Look, I don't care what you do in your
private time, but don't lie about it.

829
00:59:27,203 --> 00:59:31,497
I mean, you clearly said,
"smear mud on my ass."

830
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:37,544
And I'll tell you something.
If you wanna smear mud on your ass,
smear mud on your ass.

831
00:59:37,585 --> 00:59:39,921
Just be honest about it.

832
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:43,548
Look, gene, I've never
told anyone this before.

833
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:47,551
But I can suck my own dick.
And I do it.

834
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:50,429
A lot.

835
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:52,805
There, I said it.
I was honest.

836
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:55,141
And you know what, gene?

837
00:59:55,182 --> 00:59:58,185
Being honest
makes you feel better.

838
00:59:59,435 --> 01:00:03,939
Hey, Katie, wait.
I'm sorry about before.

839
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:06,441
- I hope that wasn't bad timing.
- No.

840
01:00:06,566 --> 01:00:08,526
- Coop, we have to talk.
- Sure.

841
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:12,571
I was thinking that what happened
between us before was a mistake.

842
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:15,031
- And, uh...
- What?

843
01:00:15,072 --> 01:00:17,074
I wasn't thinking straight.
It was wrong.

844
01:00:17,574 --> 01:00:22,578
No, it wasn't wrong.
Katie, why are you doing this?

845
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:25,038
I'm really sorry.

846
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,082
Come on!
This is a joke, right?

847
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,543
I have a boyfriend, Coop.

848
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:35,088
And I can't... I can't do
this. I'm sorry.

849
01:00:40,092 --> 01:00:42,177
Wait, Katie!

850
01:00:42,218 --> 01:00:45,971
When we first started hanging
out together this morning...

851
01:00:46,013 --> 01:00:47,931
We were just friends.

852
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:51,475
But things change, and I've
fallen in love with you.

853
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:55,103
And I just, I just know
that if you gave me a chance,

854
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:58,064
I could make you feel so good.

855
01:00:58,105 --> 01:01:01,441
So I'm coming to you,
not as your buddy,

856
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:04,110
and not as a co-counselor,
but for the first time as a man.

857
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,071
A man who loves a woman,

858
01:01:07,112 --> 01:01:10,115
and who wants to hold her,
and provide for her,

859
01:01:10,156 --> 01:01:12,116
and, yes, have sex with her.

860
01:01:12,366 --> 01:01:15,369
But, seriously, Katie,
I love the way you laugh.

861
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,453
And I love the way
your hair smells.

862
01:01:17,495 --> 01:01:21,498
And I love it that sometimes for
no reason, you're late for shul.

863
01:01:21,748 --> 01:01:25,084
And I don't care that
you're bowlegged and bilingual.

864
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:28,128
All I know is I would have said "no"
to every person on your list...

865
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,131
Because I've always wanted you.

866
01:01:33,507 --> 01:01:36,510
Coop, I don't know what to say.

867
01:01:39,512 --> 01:01:41,764
Coop, wait!

868
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:46,768
Rachael clipperhofferman,

869
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,270
- Steven schenk...
- Beth!

870
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,023
- Can I make a quick announcement
before we finish up? - Sure thing.

871
01:01:58,401 --> 01:02:02,405
I want to thank all of you
for a terrific summer.

872
01:02:02,446 --> 01:02:04,906
Cooking for all you
nice people...

873
01:02:05,282 --> 01:02:09,535
Has really helped me get over the
fact that I fought in the Vietnam war.

874
01:02:09,577 --> 01:02:12,037
Have a great winter!
I'm gonna go hump the fridge!

875
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:14,664
What?

876
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:23,671
Yes, folks, it's true. I said,
"I'm gonna go hump the fridge."

877
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:30,634
What you may not know is that
I also own a bottle of dick cream.

878
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:35,680
I fondle my sweaters, and I often
like to smear mud on my ass.

879
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:39,433
You're probably asking yourselves,
"isn't he a weirdo,

880
01:02:39,475 --> 01:02:41,434
outcast, loose Cannon?"

881
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:46,772
Maybe. I don't think so.

882
01:02:46,813 --> 01:02:50,817
I want to introduce you guys
to someone. This is my friend.

883
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:55,820
I don't know who he is,
but I do know this.

884
01:02:56,321 --> 01:03:01,325
At a time when I was trying
to hide myself from myself,

885
01:03:01,366 --> 01:03:05,328
he was there to show me a new way.

886
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:09,831
Because I couldn't hide from him.

887
01:03:10,832 --> 01:03:13,834
And I can be proud of who I am.

888
01:03:15,836 --> 01:03:19,338
I put it to you, camp firewood,

889
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:24,342
as we spend our last dinner together:
Be proud of who you are!

890
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,721
Look at me, ma!

891
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:33,558
I made it! I'm okay!

892
01:03:43,482 --> 01:03:45,483
Now, if you don't mind,

893
01:03:47,485 --> 01:03:50,988
I have some unfinished
business to attend to.

894
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,003
Great!

895
01:04:24,888 --> 01:04:27,891
Hey! Hey!

896
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:35,146
You fuckin' assholes!
Let me go!

897
01:04:37,148 --> 01:04:40,108
No! No! No!

898
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:42,652
Please, stop!
No, no, no!

899
01:04:42,694 --> 01:04:46,155
No! No!

900
01:04:56,037 --> 01:05:00,124
Oh, Henry, I'm so happy.

901
01:05:00,165 --> 01:05:03,168
But what will become
of us tomorrow?

902
01:05:03,209 --> 01:05:06,128
Hey, you. Penny for your thoughts.

903
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:09,172
Beth, tomorrow's
the least of our problems.

904
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:13,175
Don't tell me. Don't even
tell me you have crabs.

905
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:16,136
No. Well, yes,
but that's not the point.

906
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,138
- What is the point? - This isn't the
time or the place to discuss it.

907
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:23,183
Beth, meet me at the picnic table in
ten seconds. I'll tell you all about it.

908
01:05:23,225 --> 01:05:25,643
Okay.

909
01:05:34,692 --> 01:05:39,154
Beth, hello. Thanks for coming.
Let's get right to it.

910
01:05:39,195 --> 01:05:41,697
You may recall ten seconds ago, I asked
you to join me here by the picnic table...

911
01:05:42,198 --> 01:05:43,699
So I could tell you what's going on.

912
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:48,703
Well, earlier today, I saw what I
thought was possibly a planet,

913
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:52,038
also possibly a meteor
in the evening sky.

914
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,291
I now believe that object
was none other...

915
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:59,336
Than a renegade piece of skylab,
the NASA space station.

916
01:05:59,377 --> 01:06:02,838
- And it's heading right for the camp.
- Oh, my God!

917
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:07,342
And there's more. We have
no way of pinpointing exactly
where it's going to land.

918
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:09,802
- It could kill us all!
- Jesus!

919
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:12,804
Wait a minute! There
might be a way...

920
01:06:12,846 --> 01:06:15,807
To build a homemade
skylab tracking device!

921
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:19,476
- Which accomplishes? - We could
surmise the location of impact.

922
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:22,478
We could avert a tragedy on
the scale of the hindenburg.

923
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,856
- Beth, will you help us?
- Anything you need.

924
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,608
Let's do it!

925
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:30,234
Hey, Andy?

926
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:33,487
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

927
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:35,238
- Okay, well...
- Time's up.

928
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:37,740
You said a second.

929
01:06:37,865 --> 01:06:41,368
- I want to ask you something. - So you
want to talk for more than a second?

930
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:44,454
- Yeah.
- What is it then? Like a couple minutes?

931
01:06:44,495 --> 01:06:47,247
- No. Yeah, at most, say, like
three minutes. - Fine.

932
01:06:47,623 --> 01:06:50,625
- Do you really love Katie?
- Not really.

933
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,710
Because I really love her, man.

934
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:56,755
And if you have one ounce of decency,
you will do the right thing and let her go.

935
01:06:56,796 --> 01:06:58,506
- No way!
- No way?

936
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,009
Fuck no, dude. She's hot!
In fact, fuck off.

937
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:04,594
I will not fuck off.

938
01:07:04,636 --> 01:07:07,388
You're making a really
big mistake, buddy,

939
01:07:07,429 --> 01:07:10,140
because that woman
is not your plaything.

940
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:14,893
Coop, seriously...
Fuck off.

941
01:07:15,019 --> 01:07:19,022
- I'm sick of talking about this with you.
- God!

942
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:28,904
Whoa!

943
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:38,912
So this is the skylab
tracking device?

944
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,872
Is this gonna save my camp?

945
01:07:40,913 --> 01:07:43,665
I don't know. But if it does,
we'll all be heroes.

946
01:07:43,707 --> 01:07:46,584
In fact, I just got word
that if we pull this off,

947
01:07:46,626 --> 01:07:49,378
I could be up for the Hopkins
prize for physics.

948
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:53,923
The Hopkins! Baby, what a dream.
You'll finally get your tenure.

949
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,686
Be proud of who you are.

950
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,146
Huh?

951
01:08:13,188 --> 01:08:16,649
- Gene?
- Shh.

952
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:20,694
- It isn't about the girl.
- It isn't?

953
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:23,196
Well, it is,

954
01:08:24,697 --> 01:08:28,700
but see if you
can follow me here.

955
01:08:28,742 --> 01:08:31,702
It...

956
01:08:32,203 --> 01:08:34,204
Isn't.

957
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:37,665
Oh.

958
01:08:37,707 --> 01:08:41,710
So it is and it isn't.

959
01:08:48,215 --> 01:08:52,218
You are ready to be taught
the new way.

960
01:08:54,219 --> 01:08:59,724
Will you help teach me
about this...

961
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:03,727
What is it?
A "new way"?

962
01:09:42,131 --> 01:09:44,133
♪ Show me the fever ♪

963

973
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:33,712
Abby.

974
01:10:34,213 --> 01:10:37,215
Abby. Abby, my lover,
my friend. Abby!

975
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:49,057
- Hey, Neil, what's up?
- Victor abandoned the raft trip,

976
01:10:49,099 --> 01:10:51,601
and now the kids are about to
go over devil's canyon rapids!

977
01:10:56,354 --> 01:10:58,606
- Where did he go?
- He wanted to get back to camp.

978
01:10:58,648 --> 01:11:00,774
So you left the campers
alone on the river?

979
01:11:00,775 --> 01:11:02,818
Only Victor knows how
to navigate those rapids.

980
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:05,361
We've got to find him and get him
back to that river.

981
01:11:05,403 --> 01:11:08,239
It's him!
Victor! Victor!

982
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:10,740
- We lost him, goddamn it!
- I've got him!

983
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:13,076
- Where is he?
- He's calling from inside the camp.

984
01:11:13,117 --> 01:11:16,620
The only other phone is in
the infirmary! We gotta go!

985
01:11:19,372 --> 01:11:21,374
Ahhh.

986
01:11:25,252 --> 01:11:26,753
Beth, what's the matter?

987
01:11:27,253 --> 01:11:30,255
The phone! Where's
the fucking phone?

988
01:11:30,756 --> 01:11:33,758
In the back room.

989
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:53,273
We're losing time!

990
01:11:58,527 --> 01:12:01,529
My baby!

991
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:04,657
I want to make love to you!

992
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:07,159
Abby!

993
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,161
Abby?

994
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:13,622
Moose?

995
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:16,416
Um, you're gonna think
this is so shallow,

996
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:19,168
- but what was your name again?
- Oh, my God.

997
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:23,171
Do you have any idea...

998
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:26,674
What I had to go through
to see you?

999
01:12:27,174 --> 01:12:30,176
You snooze, you lose, dude.

1000
01:12:32,178 --> 01:12:36,681
Victor pulak, there's a raft of campers
about to go over devil's canyon rapids!

1001
01:12:38,307 --> 01:12:41,810
Are you gonna be part of the
problem, or are you the solution?

1002
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:50,650
Let's go.

1003
01:12:50,692 --> 01:12:53,694
Let's go!

1004
01:12:58,573 --> 01:13:00,074
Here we go.

1005
01:13:04,578 --> 01:13:08,038
- Oh, fuck my cock!
- What does it say?

1006
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,583
According to this readout, skylab is
going to land directly on the rec hall.

1007
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,543
Oh, no. When?

1008
01:13:13,584 --> 01:13:16,045
- Sometime in the next 90 minutes.
- Oh, my God!

1009
01:13:16,086 --> 01:13:19,589
- That's only one mix tape.
- The talent show's starting right now!

1010
01:13:20,089 --> 01:13:23,217
- Good evening, firewood!
- Are you ready for some talent?

1011
01:13:26,094 --> 01:13:28,971
- Beth, we have to evacuate the
rec hall immediately! - Yeah.

1012
01:13:29,096 --> 01:13:30,931
Victor!

1013
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,724
Come on!

1014
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:38,353
Stand back.

1015
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:42,857
Whoa! Whoa!

1016
01:13:43,357 --> 01:13:48,361
You're a master, Vic.
What the... what the fu... what?

1017
01:13:48,403 --> 01:13:50,863
You're doing it.
You're actually doing it.

1018
01:13:51,363 --> 01:13:54,866
Oh! You saved them!
You saved them!

1019
01:13:58,244 --> 01:14:02,247
Victor pulak, you're okay by me.

1020
01:14:02,288 --> 01:14:04,248
I'm okay, you're okay.

1021
01:14:04,749 --> 01:14:09,252
And Neil, next time we go
camping, you drive the van.

1022
01:14:26,765 --> 01:14:29,285
I wish there was another way.
Maybe we should just let them die.

1023
01:14:29,517 --> 01:14:31,019
No! My friend,
Jimmy's, in there.

1024
01:14:31,519 --> 01:14:33,521
- You have a friend?
- I'm kidding.

1025
01:14:33,771 --> 01:14:35,772
Wait a minute.

1026
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:40,734
- No.
- What?

1027
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:44,279
Well, there might be a way that
we could use our device...

1028
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,282
To slightly change
its direction, but...

1029
01:14:48,324 --> 01:14:50,242
No, it's impossible.

1030
01:14:50,283 --> 01:14:52,243
Why? What's the problem?

1031
01:14:52,285 --> 01:14:54,745
In order to do it, we would
somehow have to be able...

1032
01:14:54,787 --> 01:14:57,789
To repeatedly generate random
numbers between one and twenty...

1033
01:14:58,289 --> 01:14:59,791
In order to calibrate
the deferential.

1034
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:04,794
That would take some sort of
super mainframe computer
and we don't have one.

1035
01:15:04,836 --> 01:15:07,547
So all is lost.

1036
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:10,257
No, it's not.

1037
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:13,801
Any dungeon master
worth his weight in geldings...

1038
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:17,304
Goes nowhere without his...

1039
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:21,265
20-sided die.

1040
01:15:21,307 --> 01:15:25,185
I'd like to introduce us
to the emcee for the evening.

1041
01:15:25,685 --> 01:15:30,689
We brought him all the way
from kutscher's country club
in the catskill mountains.

1042
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:34,192
Wait!
I have some bad news!

1043
01:15:35,818 --> 01:15:38,320
And my bad news is...

1044
01:15:42,949 --> 01:15:47,952
And my bad news is... there is
no bad news. I was just joking.

1045
01:15:48,328 --> 01:15:50,288
Good one, Beth.

1046
01:15:50,329 --> 01:15:54,332
Let's give a firewood welcome
to Mr. Alan shemper!

1047
01:15:57,585 --> 01:15:59,545
Thank you very much.

1048
01:15:59,586 --> 01:16:04,090
Hello, camp firewood.
Thank you for having me.

1049
01:16:04,465 --> 01:16:09,469
I went to sleep-away camp so
long ago that it was the stone age.

1050
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:12,471
Seriously, it wasn't
the stone age.

1051
01:16:12,513 --> 01:16:14,931
It was the ice age!

1052
01:16:14,973 --> 01:16:18,601
No, really, it was the stone age.
But, folks,

1053
01:16:19,101 --> 01:16:22,812
actually I went
to camp machnudin...

1054
01:16:22,854 --> 01:16:24,856
In the pine hills
of Westchester, New York.

1055
01:16:24,897 --> 01:16:26,815
And that was so long ago...

1056
01:16:26,857 --> 01:16:30,860
For breakfast we had to eat
scrambled pterodactyl eggs...

1057
01:16:30,902 --> 01:16:33,863
And raptor bacon!

1058
01:16:33,988 --> 01:16:37,240
Back then we didn't
have cots, we had slabs.

1059
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:41,994
Instead of sleeping bags,
we had sleeping pelts.

1060
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:55,129
Our first act hails
all the way from over in bunk 2.

1061
01:16:55,629 --> 01:17:00,633
And his name is Roger,
the master broom balancer.

1062
01:17:13,518 --> 01:17:15,019
Holy cow!

1063
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:19,648
Right here, right here.

1064
01:17:19,689 --> 01:17:22,149
Let's pray to God this works.

1065
01:17:23,651 --> 01:17:26,528
♪ Love will pervade us
till death separates us ♪

1066
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:30,030
♪ we're friends
friends, friends ♪

1067
01:17:30,072 --> 01:17:33,491
That's from us to bunk 7!

1068
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,743
- Nine or six, what was it?
- Nine!

1069
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:40,288
Okay. We're getting closer.
Give me another. Seven.

1070
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:43,124
White folks are so stupid
when they get mad.

1071
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:46,668
They be like, "hey, asshole,
I'm going to kick your behind."

1072
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:49,671
But the brothers don't even need
to raise their voice.

1073
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:52,673
These motherfuckers be like,
"don't make me say it twice."

1074
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:54,674
That's true, that's true.

1075
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:56,676
I hate white people!

1076
01:17:57,176 --> 01:18:01,680
Be that as it may, this next act
is a guy named Bert flugalman.

1077
01:18:01,721 --> 01:18:04,182
But it says here
that you all know him as...

1078
01:18:04,682 --> 01:18:07,434
Mooooose!

1079
01:18:24,322 --> 01:18:26,282
Gail.

1080
01:18:26,324 --> 01:18:29,826
- Gail.
- Ron.

1081
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,205
What are you doing here?

1082
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:36,957
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

1083
01:18:37,457 --> 01:18:39,959
And I want you back.

1084
01:18:43,837 --> 01:18:46,798
Ron... I love you,

1085
01:18:46,839 --> 01:18:50,342
and I want to be with you,
but...

1086
01:18:52,343 --> 01:18:54,845
I've just had too many
woulda-coulda-shouldas in my life.

1087
01:18:54,887 --> 01:18:57,306
Well, I'm just...

1088
01:18:57,347 --> 01:19:01,350
I'm just sick and tired of being
sick and tired, you know?

1089
01:19:01,392 --> 01:19:04,853
And if you can't handle that,
then to hell with you!

1090
01:19:04,978 --> 01:19:07,980
You'll come back to me, Gail.
I know you will.

1091
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,862
I don't think so,
Ronald Von kleinenshtein.

1092
01:19:16,904 --> 01:19:19,364
I really don't think so.

1093
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:29,622
And now, camp fizzie-poo,
performing the song...

1094
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:33,125
"Day by day" from
the musical godspell,

1095
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:35,126
is susie's drama group.

1096
01:19:36,627 --> 01:19:38,188
Before we start,
I'd just like to say...

1097
01:19:38,629 --> 01:19:40,630
That the campers you're
about to see suck dick.

1098
01:19:40,672 --> 01:19:42,632
Nevertheless, please welcome them.

Well, well, well,
I can honestly say...

1115
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,159
That there is
no Broadway ditty...

1116
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,704
Closer to my heart than the one
you just heard, "day bidet."

1117
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:18,539
Give me another.

1118
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,582
- Twenty.
- There's not much time left.

1119
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:25,461
When I was at camp, my favorite
activity was always arts and crafts.

1120
01:21:25,502 --> 01:21:29,464
Or as we used to call it,
arts and "farts" and crafts.

1121
01:21:29,589 --> 01:21:32,091
We used to make drawings.

1122
01:21:32,216 --> 01:21:34,217
Cave drawings!

1123
01:21:34,467 --> 01:21:37,928
Which is my way of saying
we were cavemen.

1124
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:41,473
I went to camp so long ago
that I can remember saying...

1125
01:21:41,514 --> 01:21:44,934
"Sticks and stones may break
my bones," and meaning it!

1126
01:21:44,975 --> 01:21:49,979
I went to camp so long ago that
fucking Jesus Christ was my counselor!

1127
01:21:50,021 --> 01:21:53,982
And my best friend
hadn't fully evolved yet.

1128
01:21:54,358 --> 01:21:57,110
His name was ugh,
and he walked on all fours!

1129
01:21:57,151 --> 01:22:00,487
There were two epidemics
when I went to camp.

1130
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:03,865
Head lice and the plague...
The bubonic plague.

01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:45,730
- Uh, what?
- Yeah.

1136
01:22:45,772 --> 01:22:49,275
I've grown up a lot since before
dinner when we last talked.

1137
01:22:49,316 --> 01:22:53,236
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1138
01:22:53,278 --> 01:22:57,781
Maybe see the world. I got a couple
more weeks before school starts.

1139
01:22:58,281 --> 01:23:02,159
- But...
- Hey.

1140
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,163
I want you to have this.

1141
01:23:11,417 --> 01:23:14,794
Hurry up! I think I can see it
coming towards us!

1142
01:23:18,797 --> 01:23:21,799
And finally, ladies and germs,
is a dude...

1143
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:26,303
Who goes by the name
of... "Steve."

1144
01:23:26,345 --> 01:23:29,680
Let's give him a hand.

1145
01:23:39,813 --> 01:23:42,816
Come on, do something.
Or get the fuck off the stage!

1146
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,712
Is that wind?

1147
01:24:27,975 --> 01:24:30,477
Oh, my God.

1148
01:24:35,106 --> 01:24:37,065
Coop?

1149
01:24:37,107 --> 01:24:40,360
Coop, Coop, don't leave.

1150
01:24:40,401 --> 01:24:43,612
Coop!
Coop, I love you!

1151
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:49,075
Yeah, I didn't know it until
this very moment for sure,

1152
01:24:49,116 --> 01:24:53,620
but now I know, and it feels like
nothing I've ever known before.

1153
01:24:53,661 --> 01:24:55,580
It feels so good.

01:26:21,645 --> 01:26:24,439
Beth, we did it.

1171
01:26:37,949 --> 01:26:39,451
Whoo!

1172
01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:02,593
Baby, that was beautiful!

1173
01:27:34,284 --> 01:27:39,663
You better write to me.
I'm gonna miss you so much!

1174
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:47,544
Beth! Beth!
I got it!

1175
01:27:47,586 --> 01:27:50,005
The Hopkins award!

1176
01:27:50,046 --> 01:27:55,050
And, NASA's hiring me to go to work
for them at cape canaveral, Florida.

1177
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:57,552
I'll have a whole new life!

1178
01:27:58,052 --> 01:28:00,012
That's wonderful.

1179
01:28:00,054 --> 01:28:04,057
I knew this would happen. I would meet
you, fall in love and you would leave me.

1180
01:28:04,557 --> 01:28:07,059
Wait, hold on, Beth.
I've already told them,

1181
01:28:07,101 --> 01:28:09,519
I need an apartment
for two people.

1182
01:28:09,561 --> 01:28:13,022
- And they'll fly you back here
every summer. - Fuck you!

1183
01:28:13,064 --> 01:28:18,068
And, Beth, I know we've been
having trouble with, you know...

1184
01:28:18,109 --> 01:28:21,070
But I was thinking when the
time comes, we can adopt.

1185
01:28:21,112 --> 01:28:24,031
Shh. It's happened.

1186
01:28:24,072 --> 01:28:26,074
I'm pregnant.
We're gonna have a baby.

1187
01:28:26,574 --> 01:28:30,077
Oh. Oh, baby!

1188
01:28:30,202 --> 01:28:32,704
- Good-bye, Beth.
- Oh, hey!

1189
01:28:33,204 --> 01:28:35,206
Looks like everything
worked out for you two.

1190
01:28:35,706 --> 01:28:37,708
Yeah, it's the best thing that's
ever happened in my life.

1191
01:28:37,749 --> 01:28:39,709
I hope you like shrimp cocktail,
because we want you...

1192
01:28:39,751 --> 01:28:42,712
To be the guest of honor
at our wedding next week.

1193
01:28:43,212 --> 01:28:45,213
We would be delighted.
But I hope it's not jumbo shrimp...

1194
01:28:45,255 --> 01:28:48,716
Because I'm allergic to oxymorons.

1195
01:28:52,219 --> 01:28:54,220
- Bye.
- Bye.

1196
01:29:11,484 --> 01:29:13,985
We saved everyone's life
and they'll never know it.

1197
01:29:14,027 --> 01:29:15,987
I almost like it better
that way.

1198
01:29:16,487 --> 01:29:18,489
It was us rolling the dice
that diverted it, right?

1199
01:29:18,989 --> 01:29:22,450
- Not the enormous gust of wind, right?
- Right.

1200
01:29:22,492 --> 01:29:25,995
I feel like this entire summer,
which kind of sucked,

1201
01:29:26,036 --> 01:29:29,497
has been rejuvenated by the
events of the past 24 hours.

1202
01:29:29,539 --> 01:29:34,501
Yeah, it's like...
Well, forget it.

1203
01:29:34,543 --> 01:29:36,503
- You know what?
- What?

1204
01:29:37,003 --> 01:29:41,006
You guys are my best friends.
Well, my only friends.

1205
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:44,008
- Yeah.
- Nanoo-nanoo.

1206
01:29:51,014 --> 01:29:53,474
- So, this is it, babe.
- Yep.

1207
01:29:53,516 --> 01:29:57,269
So, obviously I think we should get
together in the city next weekend.

1208
01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:01,939
- I'll call my parents, and you can
talk to your dad and Kim. - Listen.

1209
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:06,526
Last night was really great. You were
incredibly romantic and heroic.

1210
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,486
No doubt about it.
And that's great.

1211
01:30:09,528 --> 01:30:12,989
But I've thought about it,
and my thing is this:

1212
01:30:13,031 --> 01:30:16,033
Andy's really hot. And don't
get me wrong, you're cute too.

1213
01:30:16,533 --> 01:30:20,995
But Andy is like cut from
marble. He's gorgeous.

1214
01:30:21,037 --> 01:30:25,040
He's like this beautiful face
and this incredible body,

1215
01:30:25,081 --> 01:30:29,043
and I genuinely don't care
that he's kind of lame.

1216
01:30:29,293 --> 01:30:32,295
I don't even care
that he cheats on me.

1217
01:30:32,796 --> 01:30:35,756
And I like you more than
I like Andy, Coop, but I'm 16.

1218
01:30:35,798 --> 01:30:38,800
And maybe it will be a different story
like when I'm ready to get married.

1219
01:30:38,842 --> 01:30:42,803
But right now, I'm entirely
about sex. I just want Andy.

1220
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:45,264
- Yeah.
- I wanna take him,

1221
01:30:45,305 --> 01:30:49,308
and grab him and just fuck
his brains out, you know?

1222
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:51,852
So that's where my
priorities are right now.

1223
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:54,604
Sex. Specifically with Andy
and not with you.

1224
01:30:54,646 --> 01:30:57,314
But you're really nice.
Everybody thinks so.

1225
01:30:57,815 --> 01:31:01,818
And I'm sorry if this isn't the direction
you saw things going between us.

1226
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:04,862
I still totally want
to be friends.

1227
01:31:04,904 --> 01:31:07,822
You better write me
a letter, okay?

1228
01:31:07,864 --> 01:31:10,283
Sure.

1229
01:31:10,324 --> 01:31:12,701
Cool?

1230
01:31:15,704 --> 01:31:18,706
Katie, let's go.

1231
01:31:36,845 --> 01:31:39,847
- How you doing?
- Good.

I thought we said 9:30.

01:36:12,347 --> 01:36:14,682
No, we said 9:00 so we
could be here by 9:30.
