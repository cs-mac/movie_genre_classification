00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,260
Greetings from Troma-ville,
and welcome to the lovingly

2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,660
remastered digital DVD director's

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,920
cut version of "Stuck On You."

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,830
You know, "Stuck On You" is probably

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,970
the best comedy-- indeed, before
there was Toxie comedy series.

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,140
"Stuck On You," like so
many great Troma movies,

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,360
draws its inspiration
from the newspapers and

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,820
the current events of the day.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,620
At the time, in the early
'80s, there was palimony.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,200
Palimony was a big issue, and
it was all part of the women's

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,100
liberation movement, which continues

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,250
the ongoing treatment of the
theme of women's liberation.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,180
"Squeeze Play" concerned the
women's liberation movement,

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,330
"Waitress" concerned the
women's liberation movement,

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,560
and of course, "Stuck On You"
is in the same tradition.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,140
"Stuck On You" was also greatly inspired

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,270
by the wonderful satirical
songs of Tom Lehrer, who

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,720
was a Harvard mathematician who wrote songs

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,290
like "The Old Dope Peddler"
or "Poisoning Pigeons

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,130
in the Park."

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,580
Also Stan Freberg.

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,750
Stan Freberg was a great
director, comedian, satirist.

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,080
Stan Freberg was not only
responsible for directing

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,130
those great Chun King Chinese
food television commercials,

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,900
but he did a great
record-- in the old days,

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,190
they were records before CDs-- called "Stan

27
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,570
Freberg Presents America."

28
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,390
It was kind of a musical
comedy about the discovery

29
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,800
and the development of American
history, and it's hilarious.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,820
If you enjoy "Stuck On You," or
if you even see "Stuck On You,"

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,580
you might want to check
out the Stan Freberg

32
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,090
and the Tom Lehrer records.

33
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,970
"Stuck On You" stars Professor Irwin Corey.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,600
He's one of the great American comedians,

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,240
going back to the '30s
or maybe even the '20s.

36
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,350
Irwin Corey did a lot of political comedy.

37
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,480
He had a very strong sense of humor.

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,240
He was blacklisted because he
did comedy where you actually

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,770
had to do a little thinking,
where he actually

40
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,060
had a point of view, where
he said things that required

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,630
a little guts, which is not
so popular in our society

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,210
in any period.

43
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,030

MAN: But you know what
kind of chaos he'll cause.

I mean, when a couple has lived
together for three years

or so, as you, Bill Andrews,

the property in a just and equitable manner

01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,270
About a week after Carol and I had

1334
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:19,520
our big argument about my

bad about the problems

01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,480
that Carol and I were
having, so I thought I

1339
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,970
would surprise her with tickets
to her favorite opera.

1340
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:34,260
But I was the one that got surprised.

I decided to follow Carol, but
I didn't want her to know.

clever disguise that made

me completely inconspicuous.
