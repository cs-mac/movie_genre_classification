1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,000
Don't anyone leave this theater!

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,300
The royal Romanoff Diamonds are missing!

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,000
I am Sam Grunion,
Private Eye, at your service.

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,000
Secrecy is my motto; I never tell.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,200
You will notice even my business card
has nothing on it.

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,400
I am the same Sam Grunion who solved

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,000
the international
uranium mining swindle.

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,200
Scotland Yard was baffled,
the FBI was baffled,

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,100
They sent for me
and the case was solved immediately.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
I confessed.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,300
The Romanoff diamonds still missing
are valued at one million dollars.

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,600
For eleven years I've trailed them.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,200
Through the Khyber Pass,
over the Pyrenees.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,000
Round the Cape of Good Hope
and into Gimbels basement.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,800
From Gimbels basement
the trail lead me to a group

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,700
of struggling young actors
trying to put on a show.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,300
Did diamonds bring them luck? Money?
Hardly.

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,300
Once again this
repeated the same pattern.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,300
A story of danger, cruelty,
black violence, mystery, murder!

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,300
By the way, what do you
suppose the story was called?

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Love Happy!

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,900
That's Mike Johnson.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,700
Interesting dance, isn't it?

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,200
He learned it fighting
off bill collectors.

25
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,400
That's Maggie Philips,
she's in love with Mike.

26
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,800
She's a dancer too. But it's hard
to tell when she's sitting down.

27
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,000
This is Maggie's
best friend, Bunny Dolan.

28
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,600
She invested her last
300 dollars in the show.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
It looks like a cold winter ahead,

30
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,900
so she's knitting herself
an electric blanket.

31
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
These love-happy kids
who were struggling

32
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,000
for success had two things in common.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They were under-financed,
and under-nourished.

34
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Today they had already missed breakfast

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,000
and their hopes for lunch
are pinned on one man.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Harpo, the strolling delicatessen.

37
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,200
Here he is...
shopping.

38
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,200
Looks like a classy store, doesn't it?

39
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,300
Well, on the front they
specialize in hot delicacies.

40
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,100
But in the back they
specialize in hot diamonds.

41
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,900
Bless you, my man, bless you.

42
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,800
Thank you very much.

43
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
Quiet, little darling.

44
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,900
Madame Egelichi, you are just in time.
The sardines have arrived.

45
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,200
Relax,

46
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,900
and wipe that smirk off your face.
There are policemen around.

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Yes, ma'am.

48
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,600
- We shall wait in your office.
- Yes, ma'am.

49
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,600
Thank you.

50
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,100
That's alright, just leave them there.

51
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,300
- Will you sign here.
- Thank you, boys, thank you.

52
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,200
At last. At last.

53
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,200
You little darling, you're here.

54
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,200
- Is the paraffin jelly in yet?
- Arriving Wednesday, on the Queen Mary.

55
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,500
- I have it. I have it!
- Quiet, Lefty.

56
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,700
It's in the third crate
marked on the bottom...

57
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,200
I said, quiet!

58
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,600
I want to enjoy this moment.

59
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,800
I have gone through a great deal.

60
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,100
How many commissars
did I marry, Alphonse?

61
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
Five, Madame Egelichi.

62
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,100
There were three more, were there not?

63
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Yes, the Grand Duke
and the two Ambassadors.

64
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,000
Eight weddings in three months...

65
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,900
before I could track down
the royal Romanoff necklace...

66
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,900
and its trail from
bridegroom to bridegroom.

67
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,400
And no more,
the jewels are finally in my possession.

68
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,500
If you please, Lefty.

69
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,100
The Royal Romanoff necklace!

70
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,000
One million dollars in
matchless diamonds!

71
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,600
I have out-done even myself.

72
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,100
There is something wrong, Lefty.

73
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,200
Wrong?
Oh no, impossible.

74
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,700
This is not the right can!

75
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,300
I beg to differ Madame,
it is the right one.

76
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,800
Where is the can with
the Maltese cross on it?

77
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,300
You've got it, your holding it!

78
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,500
This can has no Maltese cross
on the top or on the bottom of it.

79
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,300
It can't be!

80
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,800
The Maltese cross was on it. I saw it,
I kissed it! It must have rubbed off.

81
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,500
It was put on with
special adhesive paint.

82
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,500
A generation of rubbing
could not have removed it.

83
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,600
Mr. Throckmorton?
May I present the Zoto brothers.

84
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,700
Their specialty is taking care
of people I do not like!

85
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,200
Oh, no, no, let me open it Madame.
The diamonds are in here.

86
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Those hardly look like the
Royal Romanoff diamonds, Lefty!

87
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,500
You may proceed, gentlemen.

88
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,400
Eight marriages, wasted.
The other leg, Hannibal.

89
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,700
I'm afraid you have to stop.
I cannot concentrate.

90
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,300
You're wasting your time gentlemen.

91
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,000
Mr. Throckmorton is too feeble
a character to try to deceive me.

92
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,700
Revive him.

93
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,800
I can't understand it.
I can't understand.

94
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,100
- I can't understand it.
- Quiet!

95
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,100
Who was present when you found
the tin with the Maltese cross?

96
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,300
Oh no one, not a sole. The door
was locked. I put it in my pocket I...

97
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Wait! Yes, there was someone.
Strange looking creature.

98
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,800
Looked more like a
tramp than a truck man.

99
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,100
You will call the police.

100
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,500
Inform them,

101
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,000
that the bushy haired shoplifter has
been at work at Hurberts And Hurberts.

102
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,500
Give them a full description.

103
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,200
Offer a reward of $1,000
for his capture.

104
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,900
Have all the suspects brought
to my apartment, one at a time.

105
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,300
Police head quarters, please.

106
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,300
Hey kids, take five minutes.

107
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,700
- Excuse a-me, you Mike Johnson?
- What do you want?

108
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,100
- I'm look-a for a job.
- Wrong number, I'm all cast.

109
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,500
Hey just a minu.

110
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,600
You're missing a big bet.

111
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,400
Somebody told me you're
putting on a show with unknowns.

112
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,000
You're hiring a-peoples has
never been a-heard of.

113
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,300
Well I'm the most unknown and unheard of
actors whos-a never been on Broadway.

114
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,600
- What's your name?
- Faustino the Great.

115
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,100
- You've never heard of me? Huh?
- No.

116
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,800
What did I tell you?

117
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,900
- What are you unknown for?
- I no like-a to bragg...

118
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,600
...but the thing I'm-a most
unknown for is mind reading.

119
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,300
I give you an demonstration..

120
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,000
You're thinking of something...

121
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,600
Right so far.

122
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,700
You think of a nice, juicy steak
with-a french-a fried potatoes.

123
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
The exit is over there.

124
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,400
All right, you do not
want a mind reader?

125
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
What else do you want,
maybe a you need a juggler?

126
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,600
No juggler!

127
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,200
How 'bout an usher?
I bring-a my own flash light.

128
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,000
- Hello, Lyons.
-Mr. Lyons, so glad to see you.

129
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,700
- You're looking wonderful.
- Yeah, you sure are.

130
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Mr. Yorkman was supposed to be
here at ten o'clock. It's 11:30.

131
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Don't worry partner, he'll show.

132
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,400
Don't tell me to don't worry,
and please don't call me partner.

133
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,900
I'm removing all my
costumes and scenery, as of now.

134
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,500
The man's mad! Pulling out of the
biggest Broadway smash since "Showboat".

135
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,100
Don't tell about smashes.

136
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,600
Mr. Yorkman who's going to be here
don't write-a show, check?

137
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
- I told you exactly what he told me.
- Well, he ain't here, check?

138
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,700
OK, now we come to the next step.

139
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,400
The situation is either
Mr. Yorkman or $1,100...

140
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,700
...or I move the stuff off the stage.
As of now.

141
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,800
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Excuse me, are you Mr. Lyons?

142
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,000
- That's right.
- It's-a lucky I meet you!

143
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,900
You know I was just talking
to Max Yorkman in his office.

144
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,300
Are you a friend of Mr. Yorkman?

145
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,900
Friend? Max and I are just like-a that!
Two heads on the same neck!

146
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,800
Well, I'm glad to meet you.

147
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,400
You know Max said to me,
"Faustino you want a job"?

148
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,800
Go over see Mike Johnson. I'm backing
that show, he'll give you a job.

149
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,200
- That's what he said, Mr. Johnson.
- That's good enough for me.

150
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
He's backing the show you said?

151
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,900
Use-a you common sense.
Would I be here if he wasn't?

152
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
I've been trying to get Mr. Yorkman
on the phone to find out.

153
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,300
Ah, you don't have to bother with-a
the Max no more. Just talk-a to me.

154
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,600
Ok. Maybe I was a little
hasty about removing the stuff.

155
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,300
Ah, it's only natural.

156
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,100
You can't trust a-nobody
in a-show business.

157
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
Maybe he really knows Mr. Yorkman?

158
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,200
It's a buggy ride.
This whole show is a buggy ride.

159
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,800
- Am-a I hired? Huh?
- Yes sir!

160
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,200
That's a-fine! Thanks!
How much-a you pay me?

161
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
That kind of talk's
gonna get you nowhere.

162
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,600
- Nobody in this show gets paid.
- Not till we open and click.

163
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Ah, that's alright. I just was-a
thinking out loud. I'm-a no ham.

164
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,100
Ham. Ham!

165
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,900
Something has happened.
It's lunch time and he isn't here!

166
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,300
- Who isn't here?
- Harpo.

167
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,400
Hey, Jim! Have you seen any
funny faced tramps, with bushy hair?

168
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,500
Yeah, there a $1,000 reward.

169
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Harpo! Everybody's been waiting.
You're late with the food.

170
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,300
Now we eat.

171
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,300
Hello Harpo!
You got-a something for me?

172
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,700
You want I should read your
mind again? Alright-a, start thinking.

173
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,600
You think of the same thing you though
about a-yesterday. And-a the day before.

174
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
That's the only thought-a you've got.
Huh?

175
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
You're in love.

176
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,700
A beautiful girl is-a
gonna smile at you.

177
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,700
That's-a the only thing-a you want,
this beautiful girl should smile at you.

178
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,000
Alright, stop thinking now.
What you got for me?

179
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,400
I no wanna sardines.
You promised me something special.

180
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,900
Ice cream.
Tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

181
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,900
A royal feast!
My Robin Hood has struck again.

182
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
I'll have these tomorrow.

183
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,100
Bunny Dolan, next number.

184
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,700
Rehearsal!

185
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,700
<i>Gather 'round me my children.</i>

186
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,400
<i>Lift up your curly blond heads.</i>

187
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,200
<i>'Cause Mommy's got
something to ask you.</i>

188
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:30,200
<i>Before you crawl into
your nice warm beds.</i>

189
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,000
<i>Momma want's to know,
who stole that jam?</i>

190
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,500
<i>Who's been in here nice clean kitchen?
Who stole that jam?</i>

191
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,600
<i>Was it little Tom, or Sue, or Mable?</i>

192
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,500
<i>Who snuck it off the table?
Even ate the label.</i>

193
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,100
<i>Momma want's to know,
who made this mess?</i>

194
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,500
<i>Momma's gonna kick some teeth in
if you don't confess.</i>

195
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,000
<i>Momma wasn't lookin',
while that stuff was tooken'.</i>

196
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,600
<i>Know you had better scram.
Who stole that jam?</i>

197
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,400
<i>Momma's not the type
that get's excited.</i>

198
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,200
<i>She's lugged those groceries
home with out a squawk.</i>

199
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,700
<i>But Momma's gotta
find that guilty party.</i>

200
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,000
<i>One of you kids has to talk!</i>

201
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,100
<i>Momma want's to know
who stole that jam.</i>

202
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,600
<i>Who's been ripe with all those goodies
and her leg of lamb?</i>

203
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,600
<i>Seems to me your acting kinda flustered.</i>

204
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,600
<i>Bet you ate that custard,
and topped it off with mustard.</i>

205
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,800
<i>Momma want's to know,
she don't wanta' guess.</i>

206
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,100
<i>Momma's gonna kick some teeth in
if you don't confess.</i>

207
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,100
<i>You're that little fella
which sucked it off the shella</i>

208
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,300
<i>I don't want that lollipop.</i>

209
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,900
<i>Momma's gonna blow her top.</i>

210
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:54,000
<i>You stole that jaaaammmmm.</i>

211
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

212
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,600
Thank you for your work officer, but
this creature is not the man. Good day.

213
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,200
- Yes sir.
- Better luck next time.

214
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,300
The wrong one again. We'll
have to increase the award.

215
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,300
Answer it.

216
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,100
Oh, if I ever lay my
hands on that thief,

217
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,200
I promise you he'll
regret he was ever born.

218
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,500
I picked him up on me beet,

219
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,900
thought you might want to have a
look at him and see if he's your man.

220
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,300
Bushy hair and funny face
the sergeant told me.

221
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,500
Yes, yes. Excuse me officer.
Hang on to him I'll be back in a minute.

222
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,400
- That's the one.
- Are you certain?

223
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,900
Absolutely, he's our man, I tell you.
What do we do?

224
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
So nice of you to take
this trouble, officer.

225
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,200
No trouble at all, ma'am.

226
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,000
Is this the fellow you're looking for?

227
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
No he's not, but there is a
superficial resemblance, nothing more.

228
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,200
OK, beat it!

229
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,000
No, just a second.
Don't send him away like that.

230
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,600
The poor man looks miserable,
and lost, and without a friend.

231
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,900
And he looks so intelligent.
I would like to do something for him.

232
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,400
Would you mind leaving him here,
please officer?

233
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
I'd be a little careful
if I were you ma'am.

234
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,100
You can't trust characters like these.

235
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,500
Oh, but he looks so utterly harmless
and hungry. Please, officer.

236
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,600
- Okay ma'am.
- Thank you.

237
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,200
Uh, we'll be keeping up the search.

238
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,100
Why you...
You crummy little worthless...

239
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,300
Mr. Throckmorton!

240
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,600
I must ask you to leave.

241
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,700
She's giving him the whammy!

242
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,400
I am Madame Egelichi.

243
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,100
I've been looking for
you for a long time.

244
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,200
Because I think you may
have something for me.

245
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,300
Alphonse! Hannibal!
Search him.

246
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Alphonse, Hannibal!
You will wait in the other room.

247
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,800
I think we'll be more comfortable alone,
don't you?

248
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,800
I like you.

249
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,500
I like you very much.

250
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,500
I don't want you to be
lonesome and miserable.

251
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,300
I want to ask you a few questions.

252
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,700
A few personal questions.

253
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
But you mustn't lie to me.

254
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,600
I do not like it when people lie to me.

255
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I get offended.

256
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,900
Alphonse, Hannibal!
This creature won't talk.

257
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,600
- There are ways of making him talk.
- I give the orders here.

258
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,500
- You little devil!
- Stop that!

259
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,300
What did you do with the sardine cans?
Answer me.

260
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,200
Oh! Take him away.

261
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,000
Give him everything.

262
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
But she was doomed to failure.

263
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,100
For right now the sardines are on
a table in Maggie's dressing room.

264
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,000
For three days Maggie
had eaten Harpo's presents.

265
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,200
Smoked chicken, can turkey, tuna fish.

266
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,100
If only she had developed a taste for
sardines the show would have been saved.

267
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,200
Meanwhile the cast went
on with dress rehearsal.

268
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,300
Unaware of the troubles ahead.

269
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,900
Alright kids, lets get set
for the Sadie Thompson number.

270
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,600
That was fine, Maggie.
Now go change into your ballet costume.

271
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,100
Meanwhile Madame Egelichi, wearing
the pants of the dreaded Catwoman,

272
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,800
was desperately trying
to make Harpo talk.

273
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,700
First came the Hungarian rope torture.

274
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,600
Six hours Harpo sat
in a chair smoking rope.

275
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,400
Then four hours on the hideous rack.

276
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,100
Original from the
workshop of the fiendish

277
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,900
Ferdinand Von Krakowich of Monte Carlo.

278
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,300
Place your bets, place your bets!

279
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,000
When Harpo wouldn't talk,

280
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
Madame Egelichi decided to
take things in her own hands.

281
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,400
That meant only one thing,
her own specialty.

282
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,400
The insidious food and water torture.

283
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,100
- Has he spoke yet?
- Not a word.

284
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
- The water?
- Still dripping.

285
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
- Has he slept?
- Not a wink.

286
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,500
- Eaten?
- Not a bite.

287
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,200
Three days without breaking.
It's rather unusual.

288
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,600
After I've finished eating bring him in,
and we will give him the apple test.

289
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,500
You have refused to speak.

290
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,500
We shall keep on firing until you tell
me what I want to know

291
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,000
about certain can of
Portuguese sardines.

292
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,500
Fire!

293
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Put that apple back on your head!

294
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,500
Nothing must happen to him.

295
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,500
He's the only living soul who
can lead us to the sardine can.

296
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,700
- The gun isn't loaded, Alphonse?
- No, Madame. It is empty.

297
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,200
There were only four
bullets in it, weren't there?

298
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,300
That's right Madame.

299
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,500
Grab him, the gun is empty.

300
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,100
We've been fooled.

301
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,900
- He can speak.
- I'll stop him.

302
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,600
No, no.
Let him talk.

303
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
I'll listen in.

304
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,000
You! You gotta no heart!
They wanna sing, they wanna dance.

305
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,100
But what-a you say? You say no.
You say stop-a the music!

306
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,500
Who's you? Toscanini?

307
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,200
Harpo!

308
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Some sort of code.

309
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,300
Mr. Lyons, stop-a the noise.
Stop-a the moving. It's-a Harpo.

310
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,900
Where is he?

311
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,200
Ssssh, I'm-a reading his mind.

312
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,100
Clear your head.
You talk-a too fast, clear your head.

313
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,300
That's-a better.

314
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,500
He's a-having a party.
Everybody is hitting him with apples.

315
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,800
It's-a lots-a of fun, eh?

316
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
Hey, what-a you think?
A beautiful woman is in-a love with him.

317
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,600
For sardines.

318
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,800
What?
You don't say!

319
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,200
This-a beautiful woman
wants to marry him!

320
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,000
How much-a money she's got?

321
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,900
Tell her to come to
the Windsor Theater.

322
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,400
We've got-a lots of sardines here.

323
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,800
Lefty!
They're at the Windsor Theater.

324
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,500
He says she's-a rich-a woman.

325
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,500
Well stop-a thinking.
Listen-a to me, we're in a-trouble!

326
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,700
You bring her to the theater
right away, in half an hour.

327
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,800
Hurry up!
Quick, stop-a for nothing!

328
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,400
Alphonse, Hannibal!

329
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,100
Hey, everything is-a fine.
Harpo save-a the show.

330
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,200
He's bringing his-a
bride with lotsa money.

331
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,100
- I ain't falling for anymore stalls.
- It's a-no stall!

332
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
It's-a love!
She's-a bringing the money!

333
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,500
Boys! Keep moving the stuff out.

334
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,100
- Hey, are you a musish?
- Well, I used to play.

335
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,700
I knew it the first-a minute
I looked on you.

336
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,900
I say to myself, this Mr. Lyons,
he's-a not-a tough like he looks.

337
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,200
He's-a got-a something in-a side.

338
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,200
Something-a comes-a from the heart.
What kind of music do you like?

339
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,700
I like gypsy music.

340
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,800
Gypsy music! That's-a magnifico!
I like-a gypsy music.

341
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,300
Hey, stop-a the moving!
Stop-a the noise.

342
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
Everybody stop.
Mr. Lyons, he's a-gonna play! Here.

343
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,600
- Uh, do you know "Play, gypsy, play"?
- No, I don't know that one.

344
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,200
All right, do you know uh,
"Gypsy Serenade"?

345
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,900
No.

346
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,300
What do you know?

347
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,900
- I know "Gypsy Love Song".
- "Gypsy Love Song".

348
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah but I only know the chorus.

349
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,600
That's alright.
I verse and you follow me.

350
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,900
All right, you play the
verse and I'll noodle around.

351
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,300
What do you mean by "noodling"?

352
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,600
Like this...

353
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,800
That's good!
You noodle on that, I macaroni on this.

354
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,300
Now look-a Mr. Lyons,

355
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,600
I know you wanna make a good impression.
But-a please don't play better than me.

356
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,400
Are we playing the same thing?

357
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,500
A-ha! One too much!

358
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,400
That's very good. Now we try the chorus.
But the chorus we play Pianissimo.

359
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,200
- You know what Pianissimo is?
- No.

360
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,300
- How long you study music?
- 15 years.

361
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,900
15. You know, two more years
and you could've been a plumber.

362
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,400
All right, all right,
never mind the Pianissimo.

363
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
I-a gonna make
it-a very simple for you.

364
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,100
We play it Allegro Pizzicato.

365
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,700
That's what-a you call 'em a
high class Carnegie Hall stuff.

366
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,000
You know Allegro Pizzicato?

367
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,200
- No.
- You know Jimmy Pizzicato?

368
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,000
- No.
- None of the Pizzicatos huh.

369
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,800
- No.
- What do you know?

370
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,500
- Uh, I know Pistachio...
- Pistachio! We play it!

371
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,900
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

372
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,000
Very good! Very good!

373
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,500
Now we play one more chorus.

374
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Well, boys and girls.
I've got a little sad news for you.

375
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,200
Our show isn't opening.
We're closing tonight.

376
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,800
Without a shot at Broadway.

377
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,200
Mr. Lyons, a man of small faith,

378
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,900
is removing the scenery
and costumes from the production.

379
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,800
Uh, Mr. Johnson,

380
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,500
uh may I suggest that we do what all
actors have always done

381
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,200
since before the days of thespians
and William Shakespeare.

382
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,500
Perform without scenery,
or costumes, or salary!

383
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,400
Sorry, I can't go on
with that kind of a show.

384
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,500
Curtain's down, school's out.

385
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,000
Better luck next time.

386
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm sorry Mr. Johnson, but
Mr. Lyons said to take everything.

387
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Uh-huh.

388
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,800
Well, go ahead, say it.

389
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,100
I wasn't going to say anything.

390
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,300
You don't have to put it to words baby,
it's sticking out of your eyes.

391
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,300
I'm yellow, no guts.

392
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
Not at all, Mike,
you're just what you are.

393
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,300
And what's that?

394
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,600
A very nice, sweet, sensitive young man,
who does not belong in show business.

395
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,700
You'd look stunning in an apron,
surrounded by nice, yellow oranges.

396
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,900
- Here, have some sardines.
- I don't want any sardines.

397
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,400
I'm not throwing a bare turkey
on the stage. I'm quitting, Maggie.

398
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,900
And don't stand waving a flag,
and telling me the show must go on.

399
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,200
- So relax, it's over.
- No, it isn't over!

400
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,500
We're going to open without
scenery, without costumes.

401
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,300
Just with talented and people.

402
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
We're going to open and knock 'em dead!

403
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,400
Hallelujah!

404
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,500
Come on, lets get out of here. We'll
get something to eat and celebrate!

405
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,900
- What's there to celebrate?
- Today's your birthday.

406
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,800
Don't change the subject.
Listen Mike,

407
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,100
we've got a good show here.
If you only try...

408
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,600
What do you think life is, a fairy tale?

409
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,100
Yes. It is.

410
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,600
Fairy tales!
Sardines!

411
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,800
What do you want?

412
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,100
Could you tell me please,
where I can find Mr. Michael Johnson?

413
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,000
You're speaking to the
gentleman in person.

414
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,600
Oh, how wonderful,
you are really Mr. Johnson?

415
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,800
- What can I do for you?
- Oh, Mr. Johnson, so much!

416
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,500
- You mean in the show?
- You have a place for me, I'm sure.

417
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:26,900
Too bad, Miss uh...

418
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,900
- I am Madame Egelichi.
- Madame Egelichi.

419
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,100
Mr. Johnson,
you must have a place for me.

420
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,100
Not any more.

421
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,600
- But why?
- Because of a bankroll...

422
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
...we haven't got.

423
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,000
What I'm trying to say Madam,
with out breaking into unmanly tears,

424
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,900
...is that we're folding our show.
Calling it a day.

425
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,100
Better luck next time, Madame Egelichi.

426
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,100
Uh, You mean to say the
show is not going to open

427
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,500
and the actors are going away?

428
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,200
Oh no that...
How much money do you need, Mr. Johnson?

429
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,000
- A loan from Congress would help.
- Mr. Johnson, I am serious.

430
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,800
- I will supply the money.
- This is over my head Mike.

431
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,700
What's going on?

432
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,700
It's simple.
Didn't you say life was a fairy tale?

433
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,200
Here's our fairy godmother, with a wand!

434
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,800
And what a wand.

435
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,000
Madame Egelichi, I need 11 hundred
dollars to raise the curtain.

436
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,500
You're not kidding, are you?

437
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,700
Shall we go to your office, Mr. Johnson?

438
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,100
Lets go!

439
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,200
You are going to make me so happy.
So happy.

440
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,600
He's taking a long time
for a business deal.

441
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
He'll be back.

442
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,000
- Oh don't be a fool, lets go!
- Sorry Bunny, I promised.

443
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,600
I told you to never eat
your dinner in this room!

444
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,300
Cheer up honey.

445
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,300
Maybe he's breaking your heart to
make a better actress out of you.

446
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,000
Well baby, we're opening! Lyons is
bringing back the scenery and costumes.

447
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,100
That's wonderful.

448
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,300
Yeah, she was really wonderful.

449
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,700
She is mad about the theater
and she liked all my ideas.

450
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,200
She's a real show woman.

451
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,000
You can tell me all about it at dinner.

452
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,400
Oh, I almost forgot.

453
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,500
You'd better struggle
without me tonight.

454
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,100
Rita and I still have a lot to discuss
and I promised her that I would...

455
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,100
...but baby, I know it's your
birthday but this is important.

456
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,000
Now be a trooper, cheer up!
Everything looks wonderful.

457
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,200
It would look better if you'd
wiped the rouge of your mouth!

458
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,100
Oh, don't get any ideas, Maggy.

459
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,800
I was so excited when I saw the
money I had to kiss somebody.

460
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
I gotta run, see you tomorrow.

461
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,300
Happy birthday!

462
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,700
- Do you want all these cans open Madam?
- Yes.

463
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,000
But these open cans may attract
attention. What shall I do with them?

464
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,900
- Put them in the alley.
- Alley, done!

465
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,800
- You like-a sardines?
- Yes.

466
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,800
- Why, have you got any?
- No, but I gotta something better.

467
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,200
I gotta somethings a-worth
a million dollars to you.

468
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,500
Really?
What is it?

469
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,600
Love!

470
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,700
It come to me like a flash!

471
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,400
The first a-minute I see you.

472
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,500
It's a-what-you-call-'em
love at-a first look!

473
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,500
It's-a kind of love that's-a
never going to die.

474
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,000
Uh, would you do something for me?

475
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,300
Anything!
I climb-a the highest mountain!

476
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,100
Down and up, up and-a down!

477
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,000
I put-a my arm into the
fire. Up-a to here, for you!

478
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,900
Uh, go and uh...

479
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,800
...get me all the sardine cans
you can find in this theater.

480
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,600
Sardines? Ha! That's-a nothing!

481
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,300
I'm gonna cover you with-a sardines!

482
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,400
That's how much I love you.
Watch-a my smoke!

483
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,900
Darling!

484
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,400
My favorite animal is cats.
I collect them.

485
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,900
Darling.
Darling.

486
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,900
Madame Egelichi, at last our
search is over. Here is the can.

487
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,900
Where is the necklace?

488
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,300
- In here.
- Really Throckmorton.

489
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm sure of it.

490
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,300
He was eating sardines
and swallowed the necklace.

491
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,700
- Oh but that's impossible!
- I'll have him examine at once.

492
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,700
I no get-a you sardines.
I gotta you something better!

493
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,600
- What?
- Anchovies!

494
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,900
I have no use for them.

495
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,500
Maybe you like kippered herring?
Smelts?

496
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,800
A smoked pike bit?
I get you any kind of-a fish you like.

497
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,400
I love you!

498
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,000
Go away!

499
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,000
Go away! I'm sure your
new partner is more important than I am.

500
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,900
Oh Harpo, I thought it was...

501
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,800
This is where you live, isn't it Harpo?

502
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,300
It must be wonderful to
be like you, Harpo.

503
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,600
You live alone.
That is, you don't need other people.

504
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,200
You don't depend on them.
Never get hurt.

505
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,400
Oh Harpo, you're wonderful.

506
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,200
Harpo, I've got an idea.
I've been a fool.

507
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,700
Letting my heart stand in my way.
But it is not too late.

508
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,200
He'll still give me the part.
Tomorrow morning. Mr. Hammerstein.

509
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,700
Can you imagine me in a
Broadway production. A star!

510
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,900
A real star!
And I'll work.

511
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,300
No more Nickel Romeos for me.

512
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,300
I'll work, and keep
going, and get famous.

513
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,900
And we will be rich together.

514
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,900
And Harpo you'll be with me,
because you've always loved me.

515
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,500
I haven't anyone except you.

516
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,200
And from now on you'll
be my manager, too.

517
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,700
We'll be famous together! We'll scale
to heights of Broadway together!

518
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,500
A star and her manager!

519
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,500
We'll be important people, Harpo.

520
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,300
You'll be the most influential
manager on the Great White Way.

521
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,400
You'll have a whole suite of offices.

522
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,500
And a great big shining mahogany desk.

523
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,200
You'll be just as famous as me, Harpo.

524
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,800
Everyone will come to your office.

525
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,400
And call you on the phone.

526
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,100
All the great stars, and
writers and producers...

527
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,900
...they'll beg you to help them.

528
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,100
And you'll audition all the
great singers and dancers.

529
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,100
They'll will want advice,
about new plays.

530
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,700
Begging to work in your productions.
Our productions.

531
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,100
You'll be rich and important, Harpo.
You and I, both.

532
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,500
We'll have everything
we've ever dreamed of. Everything!

533
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,300
Sorry, Harpo.

534
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,800
I'm afraid everything isn't very much,

535
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,300
without that rotten,
horrible Mike Johnson.

536
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,300
And on my birthday, too.

537
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,500
He had to do it on my birthday.

538
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,100
He said he knew it was.

539
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,700
Oh I hope I never...
never have another birth...

540
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,700
Oh, Harpo.

541
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,400
What would I do without you?

542
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,200
You've made this the
nicest birthday I've ever had.

543
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,400
At last the show was opening.

544
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,500
When Mackinaw, my faithful operator,
reported that Madame Egelichi

545
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,900
had put money on the show,
I knew the crises was at hand.

546
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,800
Now I was close to what
I had been trailing all these years...

547
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,700
Madame Egelichi... I mean the diamonds.

548
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,500
Immediately, I started for the theater.
Incognito of course.

549
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,400
Mackinaw, you now have
a full account of the case,

550
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,300
and tonight at the opening of the play,
you may have the solution.

551
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,800
For when the curtain rises, Madame
Egelichi will be in the front box,

552
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,200
...and sitting next to her,
will be Count Bouillabaisse.

553
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,100
But if you take away
the count's silk hat,

554
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,000
his opera cloak, and
his full dress suit,...

555
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,400
...you'll have me,
shivering in my underwear.

556
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,800
Come on, Mackinow,

557
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,700
We'll be just in time
to be fashionably late.

558
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,500
- Good evening.
- I'm Ivan.

559
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,300
Well, on fret about it, you can always
change it to Tom, Dick or Harry.

560
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,900
They get around allot.
Come, Mackinaw.

561
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,900
Hey, that's not my suit you're pulling.

562
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,100
Give me the diamond necklace!

563
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,700
We've only just met and
already he's asking me for things.

564
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,100
I'm from the Romanoffs.

565
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,900
To recover the diamonds we
payed you 100 thousand Zlotys.

566
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,800
Zlotties! Did you ever try to
spend a Zloty in this country?

567
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,100
The diamonds!
Or in one hour you die.

568
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,400
Oh, yes Mackinaw. Allow me to introduce
you to the man who's going to kill me.

569
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,900
At the sound of the next musical note

570
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,700
the end of my life will be brought
to you by the Boulevard Sand Company.

571
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,300
Is your watch running fast? Would you
like me to drop a little sand in it?

572
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,800
A few more grains of sand
will fall and you will die.

573
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,000
I think I'm ready.

574
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,300
Come in!

575
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,300
Is there anything I can do for you?
What a ridiculous statement.

576
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,700
Mr. Grunion, I want you to help me.

577
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,800
I have a little sand left.
What seems to be the trouble?

578
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,000
- Some men are following me.
- Really?

579
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,100
I can't understand why.

580
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,500
- I advice you to leave.
- I take you down to the bus station.

581
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,100
Oh, if I'm not back tonight,
go ahead without me.

582
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,100
That's been the history
of all my romances.

583
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,000
Curtain time, five minutes.

584
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,300
- Alright, I'm a heel.
- That's not news.

585
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,400
Could you love a heel
that's been repaired?

586
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,700
I came back last night to get you,
ten minutes after you left.

587
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,300
- You did?
- Ah huh, with a clean face.

588
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,900
- What's all that?
- Harpo gave them to me.

589
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,900
I thought it might improve the costume.

590
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,200
No. Too phony.

591
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,300
Tomorrow, if we're not
stoned to death by the mob...

592
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,100
...I'll get you a real gem.
For the proper finger.

593
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,600
Mike!

594
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,900
Faustino! Get ready,
you're on in a few minutes!

595
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,000
I'll be ready, I'll be ready.

596
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,300
We want the diamonds!

597
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,800
- What diamonds!
- You were wearing them.

598
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,300
- Oh, those!
- Where are they?

599
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,700
I don't know!
I don't know!

600
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,300
- She's not going to talk.
- She'll talk to Madame Egelichi.

601
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,800
Or there will be murder!

602
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,900
Maggie... What's going on here!

603
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,800
Let go of her!

604
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,700
Lets search the place
before we take her away.

605
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,700
What do you want?
I should read your mind?

606
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,800
I'm-a to busy now,

607
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,000
I'm telling you you're too excited,

608
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,700
All right, I read-a your mind.
What's on-a your mind?

609
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,500
Yeah, at's a dame. All the time
you got a dame on-a your mind.

610
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,300
Oh, it's-a no dame.
It's-a nice-a girl.

611
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,600
Yeah, what about-a nice-a girl?

Who's a girl in great danger?

626
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,400
I can't read-a your hand,
I can only read-a your mind.

627
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,400
That's-a billy goat.

Oh, smart, eh?
Oh ho, catch on-a quick.

645
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,800
Maggie's in-a great danger.
Who's after Maggie?

646
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,100
That's a bird. A seagull?

An eagle, an eagle.

651
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,000
What about the eagle?
Eagle a-scratch? Eagle a-tickle?

652
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,600
Eagle a-got flees?

01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,100
A Horse a-fall down on Maggie?

659
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,300
That's a hammer and nail.
No hammer?

660
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,800
A nail! A big nail?

661
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,300
A little nail. A little bitsy nail.

662
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,300
Little, little

Egelichi's gonna murder Maggie!
Oh! Come on, lets go!

01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,600
Good luck, honey!
Thanks, Jim!

672
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,200
...all about the diamonds
or we'll murder you!

673
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,400
Hey, what-a diamonds?
Who's got-a diamonds?

674
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,000
What a-we do?

675
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,800
Alright girls, come on!
Get in line and look pretty.

676
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,300
Now remember, this is opening night.

677
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,100
Now lets hear those lines.
And put a little heart into it.

678
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,000
Perfume from Hindustan!

679
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,100

680
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,300

681
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,200
Come on, we'll take her to the hotel.

682
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,300
- But there's a show on!
- We're not interested.

683
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,800
We'll keep her there until she
tells us where she hid the diamonds.

684
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,000
Hey! Don't take her away, I confess!
I got-a the diamonds, I find them.

685
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,300
- Where are they?
- Right here, but I no give 'em to you!

686
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,300
- Here Harpo!
- Quickly, chase them!

687
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,200
Harpo, this way!

688
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,700
Help me hold the door!

689
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,800
They got to keep chasing us. If they
find out we no got-a the real diamonds

690
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,200
they're gonna stop the show,
kill Maggie.

691
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,000
And I gotta get back in the theater.
Hurry, you go!

692
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,200
That way!

693
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
After you.

694
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,600
Hurry up!

695
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,900
Find him!
What's the matter with you two?

696
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,600
He was right here! Where did he go?

697
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,900
What are you doing there you idiots!
Why didn't you grab him.

698
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,300
There he is!

699
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,900
- That's where I saw him.
- You two are out of your head.

700
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,800
He's heading up to the other roof.

701
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,800
Beautiful, beautiful, go take your bow!

702
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,100
I gotta no time. I got to give
them the diamonds. The real ones!

703
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,700
- Who's got diamonds?
- Me, look!

704
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,800
I save-a Harpo! I save-a the show!
I'm-a the hero, nobody else!

705
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,900
Hey! Hey, I got them!

706
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,800
Hey! Hey!
Leave Harpo alone!

707
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,200
Here's the real diamonds.
Look! Look! Look!

708
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:36,700
I got him.

709
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,200
The odds were a thousand to one
that I wouldn't make it.

710
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,000
But here I was, back on the trail.

711
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,600
At the risk of death I fearlessly
scrutinized every possible hiding place.

712
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,200
Ah, Madame Egelichi!
Don't you remember me?

713
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,100
Yes, I do!

714
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,800
- No, I mean before that.
- Grunion, I'm warning you.

715
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,500
This time, I'm going
to get the diamonds,

716
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,800
and nobody is going to stop me.

717
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,400
Oh no, I'm not going to
follow you and get shot.

718
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,900
If I was half-shot I'd follow you.

719
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,600
I'll take those.

720
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,800
- Give me those diamonds you fool!
- You want-a the diamonds?

721
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,500
Sure, I give it to you.
Now, what you gonna give me?

722
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,200
- That's not what I want.
- Where are they?

723
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,800
- You got them.
- The real ones!

724
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,500
Those are the real ones.
Harpo, he's-a gotta the fakes.

725
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,700
He's out there!

726
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,200
There he is again!

727
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,000
- Where is he?
- He was standing right there!

728
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,300
- That's what I saw!
- You two are idiots!

729
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,300
- There he is!
- After him!

730
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,000
Where is he?

731
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,000
- Right there!
- Alphonse! Throw the rope!

732
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,000
There he is!

733
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,900
I'll get him.

734
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,600
Good work, my man! I was just
about the enter the battle myself.

735
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,200
From now on, I'm gonna take care of you.

736
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,400
You've got the ax, of course?

737
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,100
I'm in complete command
of the situation.

738
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,300
I didn't see a thing,
all the window shades were down.

739
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,600
Search him!

740
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,600
Oh, no, I'm not gonna get into that.

741
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,800
If this was a French picture
I could do it.

742
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,300
I'll search him myself.

743
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,500
No, the diamonds have
kept us apart to long.

744
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:23,700
I'll tackle him single handed.

745
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,800
I'd kill anyone who's
got those diamonds.

746
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,600
Grunion, darling!

747
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,900
Careful, you're singing my coat.

748
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:45,700
I don't care about the diamonds.
All I really want is you.

749
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,500
- So, you finally fell for me, eh?
- Yes.

750
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,200
This is the sweetest moment
of my life. Come my darling!

751
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,800
Goodbye old man,
it was nice knowing you.

752
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,800
Please, you're tickling
my change pocket!

753
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,600
Oh my darling, lets get away together
just you and I. What fun we'll have!

754
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,200
We'll stop at the Riviera,
Monte Carlo, Rio de Janeiro...

755
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,900
Yeah, but first we'll
stop at the unemployment

756
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,700
insurance office to pick up my check.

757
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,900
And that's how the long search ended.

758
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,000
With the diamonds in the
pocket of a happy-go-lucky clown

759
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,200
who disappeared with them.

760
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,000
Never realizing their true value.

761
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,300
Anyway that was six cases ago.

762
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:38,100
Right now I'm hot on the trail
of the Calcutta cut-throats.

763
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,200
And I've tracked the down
to Good Humor plant in Istanbul.

764
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,500
Answer that, my man!

765
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,300
I'm busy.

766
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,900
Gin, eh?

767
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,600
10, 30, 40, 47, 50, 60...

768
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,000
Fine assistant...

769
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,200
There goes-a my coat.

770
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,600
Yes!

771
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,300
Yes, dear.
Yes, I'll be home, dear.

772
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,000
No, I wont be late, dear,
six o'clock, right on the dot.

773
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,500
Yes, dear.
Goodbye, dear.

774
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:13,200
My wife.

775
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,100
Formerly, Madame Egelichi...
