1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,500
We've met before.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,200
Did you save me from the beginning?

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,100
The one I believed more than myself has started to deceive me.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,930
Between my lady and myself,

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,530
there is a river that can't be crossed over.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,900
The story that will make you crave summer love in 2017

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,250
I wanted to hold her hand first.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,110
I have fallen for a woman for the first time in my life.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,900
How dare you interfere. Why?!

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,910
She is my woman.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,800
Do you want to see the bloodwind coming up?

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,900
What happens if you go up to the place where you're not supposed to.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,500
