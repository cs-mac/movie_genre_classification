1
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,999
Hit me with some syrup.

2
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:21,122
Jack, I'll be right with you.

3
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,640
Here you go.

4
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:25,560
You got the sausage,
and pancakes for you.

5
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:28,286
He's over there.

6
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:34,641
- Decaf or regular?
- Regular, please.

7
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:37,400
You're young to be smoking.

8
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:39,682
It ruins your sex drive.

9
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:52,095
I'll get it!

10
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:56,612
I got it! Hello?

11
00:02:56,703 --> 00:03:00,218
We're out of here tonight,
housewife.

12
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:02,737
I have to ask Darryl.

13
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:05,656
You mean you haven't
asked him yet?

14
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:10,055
Thelma, is he your husband
or your father?

15
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:13,215
It is just two days,
for God's sake.

16
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:15,498
Tell him you're going with me.

17
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,336
Say l'm having
a nervous breakdown.

18
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:21,256
Darryl already thinks
you're out of your mind.

19
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:24,301
- Are you at work?
- No, the Playboy mansion.

20
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:26,214
I'll call you right back.

21
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:27,782
Darryl?

22
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,180
Honey, you better hurry up.

23
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:42,132
Goddamn it, Thelma!
Don't holler like that.

24
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:48,813
I can't stand it
when you holler in the morning.

25
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:52,612
I'm sorry, doll.
I didn't want you to be late.

26
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:54,534
Thank you.

27
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:00,092
- Hon...
- What?

28
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:05,701
Have a good day at work today.

29
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,256
Jesus. Thank you, no.

30
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:15,457
Hon?

31
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,340
What?

32
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,733
You want anything special
for dinner tonight?

33
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:25,381
No, Thelma. I don't give a shit.

34
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:29,695
I may not make it home.
You know how Fridays are.

35
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:34,095
Yeah. Funny how so many people
buy carpets on a Friday night.

36
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:37,812
You'd think they'd forget
about it for the weekend.

37
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:43,011
Well, then, it's a good thing
you're not regional manager

38
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:45,139
and I am.

39
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:49,294
Ooh, yeah.

40
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:52,580
I've got to get
the hell out of here.

41
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:54,096
Jesus!

42
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:58,335
Goddamn it, Homer!
I've got to get to work!

43
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,812
I don't need this bullshit!

44
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:03,212
I'll get them. Thank you.

45
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,453
For Christ's sakes!

46
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:10,262
I want you out of here by 5:O0.

47
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,016
No, get out of here by 3:00.

48
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:19,942
Good morning.

49
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:23,140
- Good morning. Is Louise in?
- Yes, she is.

50
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,976
Thelma, run away with me.

51
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:29,260
She's running away with me.
What did he say?.

52
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,220
When are you picking me up?

53
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:34,181
All right! Around 2:3O.

54
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,902
OK. What kind
of stuff do I bring?

55
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:39,099
Warm stuff, I guess.

56
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:42,414
It's the mountains.
I'm bringing everything.

57
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:44,812
OK. I will, too, then.

58
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:48,612
- Steal Darryl's fishing stuff.
- I don't know how to fish.

59
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:51,615
Darryl does it.
How hard can it be?

60
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:53,375
See you in a bit.

61
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:55,658
OK. All right. Bye.

62
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:54,119
Hi. This is Jimmy.
I'm not here now.

63
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,882
Thelma, we don't
need the lantern.

64
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,844
The place has electricity.

65
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:30,636
- I'll take it in case.
- In case of what?

66
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,116
There's some psycho
killer on the loose

67
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:36,995
who cuts the electricity off
and tries to kill us.

68
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:39,885
Sure. Then that
lantern will come in handy.

69
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,765
Maybe we should tow
your car behind, too,

70
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,077
in case he steals spark plugs.

71
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:49,763
We'd have to. It barely
makes it down the driveway.

72
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,718
Careful.

73
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:08,638
All right. Everything in?

74
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:09,603
Yeah.

75
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:10,563
Careful.

76
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,478
Here you go. Be careful!

77
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,683
All right.

78
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:15,756
Smile.

79
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:20,534
See you later!

80
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,172
Sit down.

81
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,219
Oh, Louise.

82
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:29,134
Take care of this gun.

83
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:32,021
Why in hell did you bring that?

84
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,377
Psycho killers, bears, snakes.

85
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:35,897
I just don't know how to use it.

86
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,736
Put it away. Put it in my purse.

87
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:40,700
Thelma, good Lord.

88
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,932
So whose place is this again?

89
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:49,854
It's Bob's, the day manager's.

90
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,217
He's getting divorced.

91
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:52,975
His wife's getting this place.

92
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:54,655
He's letting friends use it

93
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,973
till he turns over the keys.

94
00:08:57,063 --> 00:09:00,772
I've never been
out of town without Darryl.

95
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:03,331
How come Darryl let you go?

96
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,618
Because I didn't ask him.

97
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:07,500
Shit, Thelma.

98
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,416
Why...he's going to kill you!

99
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,892
Well, he'd never let me go.

100
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:16,180
He never lets me
do one goddamn thing.

101
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:18,652
He wants me around the house

102
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,098
while he's doing God knows what.

103
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:23,936
Well, you get
what you settle for.

104
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,332
I left him a note.

105
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,853
I left him stuff to microwave.

106
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:54,537
Thelma.

107
00:10:15,703 --> 00:10:17,853
Thelma, what are you doing?

108
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,695
Smoking.

109
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:24,216
Hey...l'm Louise.

110
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:31,976
Can't we stop somewhere
for a minute?

111
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,816
We'll get there
after dark as it is.

112
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:38,100
Then what difference
would it make if we stop?

113
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,822
I never get to do
stuff like this.

114
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:43,098
OK, but it's a quick stop.

115
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,172
OK!

116
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,792
Haven't seen a place like this

117
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:23,754
since I left Texas.

118
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:25,748
Isn't this fun?

119
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:40,227
- Do y'all want a drink?
- No, thanks.

120
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:43,673
I'll have a wild turkey
and a Coke back.

121
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:44,633
Thelma.

122
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,515
Is this my vacation or isn't it?

123
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:50,270
God, you're as bad as Darryl.

124
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:54,350
Sorry. I'm not used
to seeing you this way.

125
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:56,428
You're usually so sedate.

126
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:59,748
I've had it up
to my ass with sedate.

127
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:03,591
You said we'd let our hair down.

128
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:06,794
Darlin', my hair is coming down.

129
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,595
All right.

130
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,349
I changed my mind.

131
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:14,669
I'll have a margarita
and a shot of Cuervo.

132
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:17,146
All right. Get me another one.

133
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,955
Hey! What are you
kewpie dolls doing here?

134
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:28,586
- Trying to have fun.
- Minding our business.

135
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:30,907
Louise is mad
at her boyfriend because...

136
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:34,995
We just wanted
to get something to eat.

137
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:37,386
You come to the right place.

138
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:39,354
They got good chilli.

139
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:42,315
Harlan, you bothering
these poor girls?

140
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:44,513
I was being friendly.

141
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,988
It's a good thing they're not
all as friendly as you.

142
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:50,510
Your name's Harlan?

143
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:54,385
- I got an uncle Harlan.
- Is he a funny uncle?

144
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:58,072
If he is, he and I
got something in common.

145
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,508
I don't mean to be rude.

146
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:06,509
I've got to talk
to my friend in private.

147
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:09,794
I understand.
I didn't mean to bother you.

148
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:12,869
It's hard not to notice
such pretty ladies.

149
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:18,635
You better dance
with me before you leave,

150
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:20,628
or I'll never forgive you.

151
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,673
Sure. That would be fun.

152
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,953
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't nice.

153
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:29,073
He was hitting on you.

154
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:31,512
So what if he was?

155
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:35,067
- Waiting has made you jaded.
- Maybe.

156
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:37,269
Well, relax.
You're making me nervous.

157
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:39,578
Well, relax.
You're making me nervous.

158
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:40,704
All right!

159
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,262
I woke up in a hotel,
I didn't know what to do

160
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:00,418
I turned the TV on...

161
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:03,342
That's a good band.

162
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:06,017
They was talkin'
about a dragnet

163
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:09,181
Said they were
lookin' for a Cadillac...

164
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:13,501
- I wonder if Darryl is home.
- Wonder if Jimmy's back.

165
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,545
Tell him to get lost.

166
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,699
Why don't you
ditch your husband?

167
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:22,144
This one's on Harlan.

168
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:25,187
Thanks.

169
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,342
Jimmy will come off the road.
You won't be there.

170
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:33,900
He'll call you 10O,00O times.
Sunday night you'll call him.

171
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:37,299
By Monday he'll kiss
the ground you walk on.

172
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:38,902
Exactly.

173
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:42,698
In the meantime,
you said we'd have fun.

174
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,461
- All right.
- OK!

175
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:56,583
All right.

176
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:02,942
Let's dance.

177
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:04,382
All right.

178
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:13,140
I woke up in a hotel,
I didn't know what to do

179
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:16,505
I turned the TV on
and wrote a letter to you

180
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:17,863
They was talking
about a dragnet

181
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:19,064
Up on the interstate

182
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,066
Said they were
lookn' for a Cadillac

183
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:24,582
With Tennessee plates

184
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,427
Ma'am, want to dance some?

185
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:33,421
Since I left California, baby,
things have gotten worse

186
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,899
Seems the land of opportunity,
for me is just a curse

187
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:39,298
Tell that judge in Bakersfield
my trial will have to wait

188
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:43,341
Down there they're
lookn' for a Cadillac

189
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:44,828
With Tennessee plates

190
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,345
She sawhm singin' once
when she was 17

191
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,943
And eversince that day
she's been livin' in-between...

192
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:53,629
You've got great moves, honey.

193
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,427
Anyway, he wouldn't care

194
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:57,306
Hell, he gave them
to his friends

195
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:00,502
All right!

196
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,625
Here we go!

197
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,581
Hey, now, baby,
you're looking so fine

198
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:16,581
Cruisng around
in your Mercury '49

199
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:21,106
Isn't that enough, baby
lsn't that enough, baby

200
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,783
Don't drive
where you're looking

201
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:27,623
Cooln'on down the line

202
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:09,548
Thelma!

203
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,018
I'm hitting
the little girls' room,

204
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,339
then we're out of here.

205
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,624
I'm ready when you are.

206
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,939
Wait. Louise,
I want to come with you.

207
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:28,779
- I don't feel so good.
- What's wrong? Come on.

208
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:31,142
Stop.

209
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:34,827
I'm spinning.

210
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:40,058
Oopsy-doopsy. You need
some fresh air, little lady.

211
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:06,623
Look, did you see my friend?

212
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:10,497
Your friend? Yeah,
she's out there dancing.

213
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,605
How are you feeling now,
darling?

214
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:20,766
Oh, thanks. I'm starting to feel
a little better.

215
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:23,970
You're starting
to feel good to me, too.

216
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,692
I think I need to keep walking.

217
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,402
Wait a minute. Where do
you think you're going?

218
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:33,485
- I'm going back inside.
- Oh, no.

219
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:35,052
- Harlan!
- What?

220
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,964
Hey, quit it!

221
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:38,281
Stop it.

222
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:41,763
Thelma, I won't hurt you, OK?

223
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,844
I just want to kiss you.

224
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,332
No...

225
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:47,404
Come on.

226
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:51,609
Goddamn, you are gorgeous!

227
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:53,809
Let me go.

228
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:56,566
- I'm married.
- I'm married, too.

229
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:59,292
I don't feel good.
I've been sick.

230
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:03,729
I said I won't
hurt you, all right?

231
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,725
Harlan, stop it!
Please! I mean it!

232
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,772
I mean it! Louise will
wonder where I am.

233
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,764
Fuck Louise!

234
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:18,131
Never fucking hit me,
you bitch!

235
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,044
You hear me?

236
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,653
- Don't hurt me!
- Shut up!

237
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,485
Shut the fuck up!

238
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:29,690
Please don't hurt me, Harlan!

239
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:31,365
Goddamn bitch!

240
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:34,371
Let her go!

241
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,011
Get out of here.

242
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:43,245
Let her go, fucking asshole,

243
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,643
or I'll splatter
your face over this car.

244
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,684
Goddamn.

245
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:00,732
All right, calm down.
We were just having fun.

246
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:04,692
You got a real fucked-up
idea of fun.

247
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:08,407
Come on.

248
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:13,570
Turn around.

249
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,523
In the future...

250
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,605
when a woman's crying like that,

251
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:25,605
she isn't having any fun!

252
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:30,969
It's OK.

253
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:32,247
Bitch!

254
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,483
I should have fucked her!

255
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,445
What did you say?.

256
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,728
I said, "Suck my cock."

257
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:48,647
Oh, my God!

258
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:53,124
- Get the car.
- Jesus, Louise, you shot him.

259
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:55,249
Get the car.

260
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:06,291
Watch your mouth, buddy.

261
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:14,287
Louise, come on.

262
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:31,042
Watch it, you fucking asshole!

263
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:45,483
Louise?

264
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:53,683
Louise, where are we going?

265
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,642
I don't know.

266
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:58,114
Just shut up so I can think.

267
00:21:58,205 --> 00:22:01,277
Shouldn't we go to the cops?

268
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:03,833
We ought to tell the police.

269
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:06,120
What should we tell them?

270
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:10,995
- Just tell them what happened.
- Which part?

271
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:14,122
All of it.
That he was raping me.

272
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:17,515
10O people saw you
dancing with him.

273
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:21,996
Who'll believe that? We don't
live in that kind of a world!

274
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,121
Goddamn it! Pull over!

275
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:02,641
Oh, great.

276
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:20,244
Thelma, l'm going to...

277
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:22,395
I'll stop for coffee -

278
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,476
just for a second -

279
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:29,081
and then l'm going
to get it together and...

280
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:31,360
I'll figure out what to do,

281
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:34,960
and everything's
going to be fine.

282
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,802
Now's not the time to panic.

283
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,115
Nobody saw it.

284
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:08,039
Nobody knows it was us,
so we're still OK.

285
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:12,596
We just have to figure out
what to do next.

286
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:16,758
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do.

287
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:20,674
I'll say one thing...

288
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:22,881
this is some vacation.

289
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:25,559
I'm sure having a good time.

290
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:27,124
This is fun.

291
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:31,596
If you weren't so concerned
with fun, we wouldn't be here!

292
00:24:31,685 --> 00:24:34,153
What is that supposed to mean?

293
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,713
It just means, shut up, Thelma.

294
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:39,444
So this is all my fault, is it?

295
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:03,713
I have to go to the bathroom.

296
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,842
Sorry.

297
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:31,159
Thanks. I'll try again later.

298
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:36,994
Get back, people. Stand away
from the line, please.

299
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:47,394
Could you identify them
if you saw them again?

300
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:49,396
I could identify them,

301
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:52,795
but they're not
the type to pull this.

302
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,719
You're not exactly an expert.
What makes you so sure?

303
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,844
If waiting tables doesn't make
you an expert in human nature,

304
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,244
nothing will.

305
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:05,681
I knew Harlan would end up
buying it in a car park.

306
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,643
I'm surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

307
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:12,843
- Who do you think did it?
- I hope it was his wife.

308
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:15,997
Do you have any ideas
or don't you?

309
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:20,636
I'd say it was some gal,
some gal's husband.

310
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:22,636
It wasn't one of those two.

311
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:25,558
The smaller one
with the tidy hairdo,

312
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:28,000
she left me a huge tip.

313
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:30,724
- Well...
- What?

314
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:34,241
Did you notice
what car they were driving?

315
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:37,874
It's a nightclub, Hal,
not a drive-in.

316
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:41,480
I don't follow customers
to the parking lot.

317
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:43,635
Lena, go on home.

318
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:45,795
You kept me here all night

319
00:26:45,885 --> 00:26:49,275
to ask me the same
question over and over?

320
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:53,324
Aren't you going to offer me
some itty-bitty little drink?

321
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,396
Behave yourself.

322
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:01,358
Neither of those two
was the murdering type, Hal.

323
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,920
This is Jimmy.

324
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,156
Thelma, you in there?

325
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:35,239
Thelma, come on.

326
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,389
The Dow Jones dropped over
12 points today, closing at...

327
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:42,302
The Dow Jones dropped over
12 points today, closing at...

328
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:45,138
We're going to need money.

329
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,424
How much do you have on you?

330
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:52,503
- What?
- We'll stop at the next town.

331
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:56,901
We'll get a motel room,
rest, then decide what to do.

332
00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:00,061
OK. Wait. I'm looking.

333
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,506
$61.

334
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,501
Shit.

335
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:11,546
$41.

336
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:14,708
We're going to need more money.

337
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:17,064
Why are you unpacking?

338
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:20,937
You said we was
going to take a nap.

339
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:23,589
I'm trying to figure out
what to do.

340
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:31,426
Well, when you figure it out,
just wake me up.

341
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:35,858
What the hell's wrong with you?

342
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,940
What's that mean?

343
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:42,022
- Why are you acting like this?
- Acting like what?

344
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,387
How should I act
when you blow somebody away?

345
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:51,179
You could help me figure out
what to do. You could try...

346
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:54,625
I suggested we go to the police.

347
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:57,507
But you didn't like that!

348
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:01,025
What's the big rush, Thelma?
They'll come to us.

349
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:16,583
I'm sorry.

350
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:19,308
I'm just not ready
to go to jail.

351
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,985
Why don't you...

352
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:28,459
Why don't you go out
to the pool or something?

353
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:32,263
I'll figure out what to do.

354
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:36,100
Jimmy, this is Louise.

355
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:40,102
- I've been trying to call you.
- Louise. Hey, baby.

356
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:44,467
Where the hell are you at?
Are you all right?

357
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,098
Yeah. I'm fine. How are you?
Long time no see.

358
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:49,588
You sound kind of funny.

359
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:51,500
I am. Real funny.

360
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,308
Are you in town?
This sounds long distance.

361
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:57,938
No. I'm out of town. I'm in...

362
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,147
I'm in deep shit, Jimmy.
Deep Shit, Arkansas.

363
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:07,257
Louise, just tell me
what the hell is going on.

364
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:10,785
I come back,
nobody knows where you are.

365
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:12,780
Is Thelma with you?

366
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:15,429
Listen, Jimmy.

367
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:18,228
I have about $6,70O in the bank.

368
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:22,905
I know you can't get it out,
but I need that money.

369
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:27,658
Can you wire me the $6,70O,
and I'll pay you back?

370
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:30,138
What the fuck is going on,
Louise?

371
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:34,108
Listen...

372
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:36,498
Something real bad has happened.

373
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:39,863
And I can't tell you what...

374
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:46,265
Just that I did it,
and I can't undo it.

375
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:51,346
Will you help me, please?

376
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:54,262
Yeah, baby. Of course.

377
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:58,024
Where? Why can't I
bring it to you?

378
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,065
Jimmy...

379
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:11,825
Do you love me?

380
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:19,185
Yeah.

381
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:20,497
Never mind.

382
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:25,105
Look, just wire it
to Western Union

383
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,623
in Oklahoma City, OK?

384
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:30,587
- So that's where you are.
- Not yet.

385
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:33,627
Call back and I'll
tell you which office.

386
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:37,497
All right.
I'll call you in an hour.

387
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,179
Thelma, get in the car.

388
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:17,525
Even if they didn't do it,
they most likely witnessed it.

389
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:21,803
Even if they didn't do it,
they most likely witnessed it.

390
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:25,480
- Put out an APB.
- All right.

391
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:29,160
Any reason to believe
they've left the state?

392
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,242
That's certainly possible.

393
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:36,443
Why don't we let
the Bureau in on this?

394
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:49,518
Louise, don't get mad, OK,
but where are we going?

395
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:53,962
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's going
to wire me some money.

396
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:57,754
You talked to Jimmy?
Did you tell him? ls he mad?

397
00:32:57,845 --> 00:32:59,756
No. I didn't tell him.

398
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:03,201
Darryl's been calling,
mad as a hornet.

399
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:08,405
When you call him, you've got
to not tell him anything.

400
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,396
Sound real normal.

401
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:13,875
I called the asshole
at 4:O0 in the morning.

402
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:15,842
He wasn't even home.

403
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:19,554
I don't know what
he's got to be mad about.

404
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:25,836
Thelma, l'm going to Mexico.

405
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:30,953
I can make it in two
and a half days if I haul ass.

406
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:36,278
Are you up to this?
It's no game.

407
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:40,802
I'm in deep shit. I've got
to know what you're gonna do.

408
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:44,440
I don't know, Louise.

409
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:47,437
I mean, I don't know
what you're asking.

410
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,880
Don't you start flaking out!

411
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:52,274
Every time we get in trouble,

412
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:56,916
you get blank or plead insanity
or some such shit.

413
00:33:57,005 --> 00:34:00,122
Not this time.
This time things have changed.

414
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,241
Everything's changed.

415
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:07,441
But I'm going to Mexico.

416
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:09,402
I'm going.

417
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,527
Louise?

418
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,997
Is that the way
you answer the phone?

419
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,158
I was afraid I missed you.

420
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:57,480
I got it. I couldn't
cash a cheque on Saturday.

421
00:34:57,568 --> 00:35:01,243
- Who did it?
- Friend of mine. Owns a club.

422
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:03,046
You didn't tell him?

423
00:35:03,128 --> 00:35:06,006
I told him I was buying a car.

424
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:09,160
That's real good. Where do I go?

425
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:11,967
It's a place called
the Vagabond Motel.

426
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:15,757
It's at 1921 North, East 23rd.

427
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,408
It's under "Peaches."

428
00:35:18,488 --> 00:35:20,046
What?

429
00:35:23,128 --> 00:35:25,039
That's the codeword.

430
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:27,005
I miss you, Peaches.

431
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:29,807
Thanks, Jimmy. I appreciate it.

432
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:46,087
Ma'am, wouldn't you rather have
the large economy size?

433
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:49,159
No, that's all right.

434
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:52,966
What are you looking at?

435
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:56,245
I want you to call Darryl.

436
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:57,807
Call him?

437
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,322
Tell him you'll be
home tomorrow.

438
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,887
Will I be?

439
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:05,199
I don't know. I won't.

440
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:09,523
The newspaper.

441
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:25,244
This is Darryl.

442
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:28,126
A collect call from Thelma.
Will you accept?

443
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,244
Why, yes, I will, operator.

444
00:36:30,328 --> 00:36:34,003
Thelma, where in
the Sam Hill are you?

445
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:37,046
I'm with Louise.

446
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,040
We're in the mountains.
We're fishing.

447
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:42,278
Have you lost your mind?

448
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,758
I leave for work, and you
take leave of your senses!

449
00:36:45,848 --> 00:36:48,408
Darryl, calm down, please.

450
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:51,525
Don't get so mad.
I can explain.

451
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:52,961
See, Louise...

452
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:54,925
Hold on.

453
00:36:55,008 --> 00:36:58,921
Come on. Pick it.

454
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,885
Shit.

455
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,367
God!

456
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,485
Christ.

457
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:08,526
We're just going
to stay there and fish.

458
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:11,520
We'll just be gone one more day.

459
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:14,076
No, you'll be back today.

460
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:17,046
Get your butt back here,
Thelma, now.

461
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:18,481
Goddamn it!

462
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:27,083
Darryl, you're my husband,
not my father.

463
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,045
That does it.

464
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:31,881
That Louise is a bad influence.

465
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:34,960
If you're not back here
by tonight...

466
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:42,399
Well, then, I just
don't want to say.

467
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:49,917
Go fuck yourself.

468
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:54,600
That's, good. That's just sweet.

469
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:02,132
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

470
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:05,492
- Did I cause that?
- No, I'm sorry.

471
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:09,455
Are you OK? ls there
something I can do for you?

472
00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:11,413
No. It's OK.

473
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:17,766
Crazy women.

474
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:00,773
Excuse me, ma'am.

475
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:03,324
Could I ask
where you're heading?

476
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:05,532
I'm trying to get
back to school,

477
00:39:05,616 --> 00:39:07,686
and my ride fell through.

478
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,574
I was thinking
if you're going my way,

479
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:12,806
or I'm going your way...

480
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,852
We're going to Oklahoma City.

481
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,927
- Perfect.
- I'm not sure.

482
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:19,291
Well, I'd appreciate it much.

483
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:23,085
Well, see,
it's really not up to me.

484
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:25,087
It's not my car.

485
00:39:25,176 --> 00:39:29,294
We'd have to ask my friend,
but she'd probably say no.

486
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:31,332
She's a little uptight.

487
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:35,170
Maybe it's not a good idea,
but thank you for your time.

488
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:38,566
I mean, I can ask.
It wouldn't hurt.

489
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:40,886
Well, no, it wouldn't hurt.

490
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:48,452
Louise, this young man
is on his way back to school.

491
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:51,096
Since we're going
the same direction,

492
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:54,009
we could give him a ride.

493
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:58,890
It's probably not a good idea.

494
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:03,166
Probably not,
but I appreciate your time.

495
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:05,486
You all have a good day.

496
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:14,256
Did you see how polite he is?

497
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:17,085
What?

498
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:21,493
Cheer up, now. Bye.

499
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,813
Fill her up.

500
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,252
I wish we could have
brought him with us.

501
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:38,169
What did Darryl have to say?.

502
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:43,284
He said, "I just wanted
to make sure you was all right.

503
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:46,652
"I hope you're having fun.
You deserve it.

504
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,772
"I love you."

505
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:57,811
So how long before
we're in goddamn Mexico?

506
00:41:16,536 --> 00:41:21,610
I just didn't think it would
hurt to give somebody a ride.

507
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:23,766
Did you see his butt?

508
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,051
Darryl don't have a cute butt.

509
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:30,095
You could park a car
in the shadow of his ass.

510
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:33,851
I'm sorry. I'm not
in the mood for company.

511
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:39,249
Here. Find all
the secondary roads

512
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:41,406
to Mexico from Oklahoma City.

513
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:44,010
We should stay
off the interstate.

514
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:51,289
We could get on this road, 81,
and head down towards Dallas.

515
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:54,413
No. I don't want
to go through Texas.

516
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:02,650
Wait. You want to go
to Mexico from Oklahoma,

517
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:04,647
but not through Texas?

518
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:08,649
Thelma, you know how
I feel about Texas.

519
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,887
Louise, we're running
for our lives.

520
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:13,887
Can't you make an exception?

521
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:19,175
The only thing between
Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!

522
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:22,168
Thelma, l'm not going
to talk about this!

523
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:24,212
Find another way, or I will!

524
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:27,174
- Understand?
- No, Louise, I don't.

525
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:31,568
How come you never told me
what happened to you there?

526
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:38,975
Look, if you shoot a guy
with his pants down,

527
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:43,572
Texas is not the place
to get caught.

528
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,055
Trust me!

529
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:24,886
Happy birthday, lady.

530
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,007
Is the manager in?

531
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:11,163
Marian, there's
a police officer here.

532
00:45:07,091 --> 00:45:11,130
The other night, there was
a murder at the Silver Bullet.

533
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:12,769
A man was shot.

534
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:18,847
Some witnesses saw
a 1966 T-bird convertible

535
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:23,083
Ieaving the scene,
speeding out of the driveway.

536
00:45:23,171 --> 00:45:26,607
That vehicle is
registered to Louise Sawyer,

537
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:29,205
and we have reason to believe

538
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:33,284
that your wife was the other
occupant of that car.

539
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:35,884
What?

540
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,807
You're standing in your pizza.

541
00:45:45,891 --> 00:45:48,121
Shit!

542
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:51,849
Miss Thelma,
how come you ain't got kids?

543
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:55,207
God gives you something special,
you should pass it on.

544
00:45:55,291 --> 00:46:01,082
Well, Darryl - my husband -
says he's not ready yet.

545
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:03,844
He says he's still
too much of a kid.

546
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:06,081
Prides himself
on being infantile.

547
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:07,604
He's got a lot to be proud of.

548
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:11,604
- Louise and him don't get on.
- That's putting it mildly.

549
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:13,170
He's a pig.

550
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:16,482
Did you get married
real young, Miss Thelma?

551
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:20,086
Well, I guess 18
is kind of young.

552
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:25,800
We'd been going out four years
when we got married.

553
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:27,847
- How long?
- Four years.

554
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:30,161
I never been with anybody else.

555
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:32,401
Oh, I'm sorry.

556
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:35,528
Well, if you don't mind
me saying so,

557
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:37,920
he sounds like an asshole.

558
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:41,763
That's OK. He is an asshole.

559
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:44,081
Mostly, I let it slide.

560
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:49,328
You better slow down.
That's a cop up ahead.

561
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:28,367
Maybe you've got
a few parking tickets?

562
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:32,888
We'll take you to Oklahoma City,
then you'd best be on your way.

563
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:43,727
Prints on the trunk match
those of Thelma Dickinson.

564
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:46,041
I'll be damned.
Isn't that strange?

565
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:49,043
And the husband says
a gun is missing.

566
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:51,087
She took a lot of stuff.

567
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:54,846
It looks like she maybe planned
on being gone a while.

568
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:59,049
Her husband said
she'd never touch that gun.

569
00:47:59,131 --> 00:48:02,840
He got it for her
because he's out late a lot,

570
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:06,560
but he said
she'd never touch it,

571
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:09,245
just kept it in the drawer.

572
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:11,640
- What kind?
- .38.

573
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:13,289
Right. Where are they?.

574
00:48:13,371 --> 00:48:15,441
They left for some guy's cabin.

575
00:48:20,043 --> 00:48:23,513
Now, I'm going...
Listen up, you two.

576
00:48:23,603 --> 00:48:27,039
It'll just take a minute.
Say your good-byes.

577
00:48:34,283 --> 00:48:38,435
Hi. I'm here to pick up
a money order for Louise Sawyer.

578
00:48:40,643 --> 00:48:42,474
There's nothing.

579
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:46,678
How about Peaches?
Could you try codeword Peaches?

580
00:48:46,763 --> 00:48:49,596
Did I hear somebody
say "Peaches?"

581
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:51,401
My God. Jimmy.

582
00:48:51,483 --> 00:48:53,439
That's the secret word.

583
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:55,957
Show the lady what she's won.

584
00:48:57,283 --> 00:48:59,274
What are you doing here?

585
00:48:59,363 --> 00:49:02,002
I just came to see you, baby.

586
00:49:03,323 --> 00:49:08,192
Can I have another room, please?
Put it on my credit card.

587
00:49:16,283 --> 00:49:18,751
Thelma, get your foot down.

588
00:49:18,843 --> 00:49:23,155
- Look who's here.
- Oh, shit! Jimmy! Hi.

589
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:25,074
What are you doing here?

590
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:28,678
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

591
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:30,993
Same goes double for me.

592
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,039
Who's the cowboy?

593
00:49:33,123 --> 00:49:36,035
This is JD. He's...

594
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:36,760
He's gone.

595
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:39,755
We're giving him a ride to here.

596
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:43,040
Louise said he'd have to go,
so that's what he's doing.

597
00:49:43,123 --> 00:49:44,875
Yep. That's what I'm doing.

598
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:46,521
He's gone.

599
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:50,359
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.

600
00:49:52,843 --> 00:49:54,754
Yep. That's him going.

601
00:49:54,843 --> 00:49:57,152
I love watching him go.

602
00:49:57,243 --> 00:49:59,518
Thelma kind of tookto him.

603
00:49:59,603 --> 00:50:03,835
I got you a room, Thelma.
Take a nice cold shower.

604
00:50:03,923 --> 00:50:06,198
I'm just a wild woman.

605
00:50:17,963 --> 00:50:20,079
It's our future.

606
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:30,154
What will you tell him?

607
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:35,152
Nothing. I'm not going
to tell him a thing.

608
00:50:35,243 --> 00:50:39,714
The least I can do is not make
him more of an accessory.

609
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,192
You are so sweet to that guy.

610
00:50:42,283 --> 00:50:45,400
Imagine not wanting
to drag him into this.

611
00:50:45,483 --> 00:50:47,360
I didn't invite him.

612
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:50,321
He's like any guy.
He loves the chase.

613
00:50:50,403 --> 00:50:54,601
He's got his work cut out
for him now, don't he?

614
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:56,275
Put a lid on it!

615
00:50:58,883 --> 00:51:04,241
Now...l want you to just...
You guard that money.

616
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:06,075
OK.

617
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:10,122
And if there's any problem,
call me in room 211.

618
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:14,994
I won't wait up.

619
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:34,638
- You want a drink?
- No.

620
00:51:34,722 --> 00:51:37,839
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

621
00:51:39,962 --> 00:51:41,953
I'm not going to tell you.

622
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:45,921
Some day soon
you'll understand why I can't.

623
00:51:49,362 --> 00:51:51,398
Can I ask you one thing?

624
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:52,756
Maybe.

625
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:54,958
Do you love somebody else?

626
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:58,637
Does this have something
to do with another man?

627
00:51:58,722 --> 00:52:00,713
No, it's not anything like that.

628
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:07,961
What is it? Are you
gonna leave for fucking ever?

629
00:52:09,442 --> 00:52:11,956
Did you fucking kill somebody?

630
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:14,840
You start this shit,
I'm out of here.

631
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:19,794
I'm sorry.

632
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:28,190
Come back and sit down.
I want to give you something.

633
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:32,321
I'm fine right here.
Give it to me here.

634
00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:38,516
Here.

635
00:52:48,642 --> 00:52:51,110
Why don't you try it on?

636
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:57,034
You didn't see
that one coming, did you?

637
00:52:57,122 --> 00:52:59,078
Why, Jimmy?

638
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:03,554
Why now?

639
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:07,236
Try not to get
too excited, Louise.

640
00:53:07,322 --> 00:53:09,711
I just flew across two states

641
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:12,396
with that ring
in my fucking hand,

642
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:15,474
and you know I hate to fly.

643
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:19,752
You came all this way

644
00:53:19,842 --> 00:53:23,039
because you thought
I was with somebody else.

645
00:53:24,282 --> 00:53:26,842
No. That's not why I came.

646
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:33,676
Because, you know,
I don't want to lose you.

647
00:53:33,762 --> 00:53:36,151
I feel like you'll split.

648
00:53:36,242 --> 00:53:39,234
That's not a good reason
to get married.

649
00:53:40,562 --> 00:53:43,122
I thought
that's what you wanted.

650
00:53:44,442 --> 00:53:48,401
I did...but not like this.

651
00:54:00,482 --> 00:54:02,313
No, Thelma. It's me.

652
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:04,074
Surprise.

653
00:54:06,002 --> 00:54:09,278
I was just out there,
and I was thinking...

654
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:13,753
I know I'm supposed to be
gone and all but, you know...

655
00:54:16,682 --> 00:54:20,277
And I'm not having
a turd's luck getting a ride.

656
00:54:20,362 --> 00:54:23,195
I was just thinking about you.

657
00:54:27,402 --> 00:54:29,279
This is crazy.

658
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:32,559
I'm going to get
out of your hair.

659
00:54:32,642 --> 00:54:37,193
Well, wait.
Where are you going?

660
00:54:40,522 --> 00:54:44,197
I don't know. You know, nowhere.

661
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:48,241
You think I'm happy playing
one-night gigs in Ramada lnns?

662
00:54:48,322 --> 00:54:50,233
I have dreams.

663
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:52,199
We got what we settled for.

664
00:54:52,282 --> 00:54:54,842
I think maybe you don't
love me any more.

665
00:54:54,922 --> 00:54:57,390
No. I do love you.

666
00:55:00,722 --> 00:55:07,116
But I think it's time to just...
Iet go of the old mistakes.

667
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:14,070
Just chalk it up to...
bad timing.

668
00:55:15,402 --> 00:55:18,155
I think it's time to let go.

669
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,966
Come on. You're too...

670
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:31,003
- All right. Your turn.
- Your turn.

671
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,682
Come on.

672
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:36,126
Don't leave...
just leave them there.

673
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:42,204
This is an unfair advantage.

674
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,282
You got too much
metal going here.

675
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,930
Want to lighten
the load a little?

676
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,166
I think that's better.
What do you think? Yeah.

677
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,367
Take me, break me, make me mad.

678
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,362
- Watch your head.
- I'm all right.

679
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,520
Who are you, anyway?.

680
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,962
The great and powerful Oz.
Who do you want to be?

681
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,564
You're not just some schoolboy.

682
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,720
Nobody ever tells me shit.

683
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,721
I'm just some guy,

684
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:20,928
a guy whose parole officer
is probably having a shit-fit.

685
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,319
What do you mean,
parole officer?

686
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,401
Are you a criminal?

687
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,765
No, not no more, Thelma.

688
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,968
Besides busting parole,
I haven't done one wrong thing.

689
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,599
- What'd you do?
- I'm a robber.

690
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:40,323
- You're a bank robber?
- No. I don't rob no banks.

691
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,520
What did you rob?

692
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:49,201
Well, let's see.
Let's add it up here.

693
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,564
Robbed a gas station,

694
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,165
a couple convenience stores,
liquor stores.

695
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,400
Oh, my God.

696
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,283
How?.

697
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,649
Come on.

698
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,642
OK. First, you pick your place.

699
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:11,723
Then I sit back and watch it
for a little while,

700
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,768
wait for that right moment
to make my move.

701
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,966
That shit cannot be taught.

702
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,804
And... Shit, I don't want
to talk about this.

703
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,642
I do.

704
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:25,889
All right.

705
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:29,167
Then l'd waltz right in.

706
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:33,564
Yep. I just waltz
on in and I say,

707
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:37,165
"Let's see who wins the prize
for keeping their cool.

708
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,081
"Everybody on the floor."

709
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:42,526
"Nobody lose their head,
and nobody loses their head.

710
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:45,568
"You, sir, you do the honours.

711
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:49,802
"Put the cash in a bag and you
got a great story to tell.

712
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:53,644
"If not, you got
a tag on your toe. You decide."

713
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,039
Simple as that.

714
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,280
Then I just slip on out

715
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,001
and get the hell out of Dodge.

716
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:08,563
My goodness. You were
gentlemanly about it

717
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,323
I've always believed,
if done properly,

718
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:15,039
armed robbery doesn't have to be
a totally unpleasant experience.

719
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,644
- What?
- You're a real live outlaw.

720
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,800
I may be an outlaw, darling,

721
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,723
but you're the one
stealing my heart.

722
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:28,200
- Smooth.
- Oh, isn't he?

723
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:31,282
- You're smooth.
- Isn't he? That's right.

724
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:33,326
I like it that way.

725
00:58:38,778 --> 00:58:38,858
Remember when we first met?

726
00:58:38,858 --> 00:58:41,372
Remember when we first met?

727
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,411
Yeah.

728
00:58:46,058 --> 00:58:48,014
Tell me what you said.

729
00:58:48,098 --> 00:58:51,010
I said you had
a nice pair of eyes.

730
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:55,530
And what did I say?
Do you remember?

731
00:58:57,338 --> 00:58:59,727
Yeah. You shut them,

732
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:03,174
asked me if I knew
what colour they were.

733
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:05,567
And what did you say?.

734
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:08,854
I didn't know.

735
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:15,690
Jimmy, what colour
are my eyes?

736
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:20,889
They're brown.

737
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:29,847
You want some more coffee?

738
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:43,162
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you

739
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:46,402
or what happened
or what you all did,

740
01:01:46,491 --> 01:01:50,200
but I'm not going
to tell anybody anything,

741
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,486
or say I even saw you.

742
01:01:56,611 --> 01:02:01,002
Did you take some pill that
makes you say the right stuff?

743
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:06,283
Yeah. I'm choking on it.

744
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:12,367
Sure you don't
want me to go with you?

745
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:17,167
It's probably not
a real good idea right now,

746
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:20,800
but I'll catch up
with you later...

747
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:22,730
on down the road.

748
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:33,800
Well...my taxi's here.

749
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:41,970
So why don't you
just keep that?

750
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:45,088
- OK?
- Thanks.

751
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:49,209
I just want you to be happy.

752
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:53,204
I am happy, sweetie.
Happy as I can be.

753
01:02:55,811 --> 01:02:57,403
All right.

754
01:02:59,331 --> 01:03:03,688
Well, why don't you give
old Jimmy a kiss goodbye,

755
01:03:03,771 --> 01:03:06,922
and I'll be getting
out of here.

756
01:03:09,771 --> 01:03:11,966
Come here, old Jimmy.

757
01:03:45,931 --> 01:03:48,047
I'll be seeing you, Louise.

758
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:55,006
You have a safe trip.

759
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:10,920
Good thing he left when he did.

760
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:13,889
We thought we'd have
to put out a fire.

761
01:04:27,474 --> 01:04:29,669
What happened to your hair?

762
01:04:29,754 --> 01:04:32,029
Nothing. Got messed up.

763
01:04:33,354 --> 01:04:35,265
Thelma, what's wrong with you?

764
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:39,586
Nothing. Why?
Do I seem different?

765
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:43,183
Now that you mention it, yeah.

766
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:46,152
You seem like
you're crazy or on drugs.

767
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:49,465
Well, I'm not on drugs,

768
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:51,704
but I might be crazy!

769
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:58,143
Thelma, what happened?

770
01:05:00,834 --> 01:05:03,394
- What happened?
- JD came back.

771
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:05,066
My God, Louise.

772
01:05:05,154 --> 01:05:07,622
- Oh, no.
- I just can't believe it.

773
01:05:07,714 --> 01:05:08,863
No!

774
01:05:08,954 --> 01:05:10,910
Oh, my God, it's like...

775
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:14,748
I finally understand
what all the fuss is about.

776
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:17,951
It's like a whole
'nother ball game.

777
01:05:18,034 --> 01:05:21,709
Darling, I'm so happy
for you, I really am.

778
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:25,150
You finally got laid properly.
That's so sweet.

779
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:29,472
- Where is he?
- He's taking a shower.

780
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,108
You left him alone in the room?

781
01:05:36,594 --> 01:05:38,346
Where's the money?

782
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,551
- Oh, my God.
- It's on the bed table.

783
01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:43,431
It's OK!

784
01:05:45,034 --> 01:05:48,106
It's on the nightstand.
It's OK!

785
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:56,148
Oh, goddamn it!

786
01:05:56,234 --> 01:05:59,510
I have never been lucky,
not one time!

787
01:06:01,154 --> 01:06:04,863
Shit! That son-of-a-bitch
burgled me.

788
01:06:04,954 --> 01:06:06,433
I don't believe it.

789
01:06:13,834 --> 01:06:15,665
You OK?

790
01:06:22,154 --> 01:06:24,224
I'm sorry. I mean it.

791
01:06:29,954 --> 01:06:32,593
Louise, it's OK.

792
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:37,265
- It's OK.
- No, Thelma, it's not OK.

793
01:06:37,354 --> 01:06:39,868
It's definitely not OK.

794
01:06:41,474 --> 01:06:43,783
None of this is OK.

795
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:49,312
I mean, what are we going
to do for money?.

796
01:06:49,394 --> 01:06:51,305
How are we going to get gas?

797
01:06:51,394 --> 01:06:53,862
I mean,
trading on our good looks?

798
01:06:53,954 --> 01:06:59,870
I mean... Oh, goddamn,
Thelma, it's not OK.

799
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:08,351
Now, you listen to me.

800
01:07:08,434 --> 01:07:10,584
Don't you worry about it.

801
01:07:10,674 --> 01:07:13,746
You hear me? Come on!

802
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:15,825
Stand up.

803
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:21,584
Louise, just don't you
worry about it. You hear?

804
01:07:21,674 --> 01:07:23,505
Come on.

805
01:07:24,994 --> 01:07:27,030
Come on, damn it!

806
01:07:27,114 --> 01:07:29,389
Let's get out of here.

807
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:33,267
Move! Jesus Christ, come on.

808
01:07:33,354 --> 01:07:34,946
Come on.

809
01:07:35,954 --> 01:07:38,184
Take your damn time.

810
01:08:07,373 --> 01:08:09,523
Afraid of a little rain, Matt?

811
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:16,688
Well, come on in.
Wipe your feet.

812
01:08:29,133 --> 01:08:33,331
As you know, we've tapped
your phone in case she calls.

813
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:37,850
- Is that going to cost me?
- Excuse me. May l?

814
01:08:37,933 --> 01:08:41,164
Live it up.
That's what it's there for.

815
01:08:41,253 --> 01:08:45,212
We'll have someone here
on the phones till we find them.

816
01:08:45,293 --> 01:08:48,842
Don't let on
you know anything.

817
01:08:48,933 --> 01:08:51,731
We want to find out
where they are.

818
01:08:51,813 --> 01:08:53,804
I don't want to get personal,

819
01:08:53,893 --> 01:08:56,566
but do you two
have a good relationship?

820
01:08:56,653 --> 01:08:59,804
I love Thelma.

821
01:08:59,893 --> 01:09:03,602
I don't intend anything
by that, sir.

822
01:09:03,693 --> 01:09:06,765
I have to ask.
Are you close with her?

823
01:09:06,853 --> 01:09:09,128
Yeah. I guess.

824
01:09:09,213 --> 01:09:13,286
As close as I can be
to a nutcase like that.

825
01:09:16,973 --> 01:09:21,808
Yeah, well, if she calls,
just be gentle.

826
01:09:21,893 --> 01:09:25,568
You know, like you're
really happy to hear from her.

827
01:09:25,653 --> 01:09:29,566
Like you really miss her.
Women love that shit.

828
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,323
OK. If you say so.

829
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,929
Women love that shit.

830
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:57,517
Oh, cool. Can I wear these?

831
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:05,476
Want anything?

832
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:07,673
Drive, Louise!
Drive the car!

833
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:15,004
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

834
01:11:18,205 --> 01:11:22,084
What happened?
You robbed the store?

835
01:11:22,165 --> 01:11:24,633
You robbed the goddamn store?

836
01:11:24,725 --> 01:11:26,556
Well, we needed the money!

837
01:11:26,645 --> 01:11:29,113
It's not like I killed anybody.

838
01:11:29,205 --> 01:11:31,594
We needed money. Now we have it.

839
01:11:31,685 --> 01:11:34,677
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, Thelma!

840
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:38,997
Louise, come on, get a grip.
Drive us to Mexico.

841
01:11:39,085 --> 01:11:41,235
OK. Oh, shit.

842
01:11:43,445 --> 01:11:46,881
How did you...
I mean, what did you say?.

843
01:11:46,965 --> 01:11:50,241
I just waltzed
on in there, and I said...

844
01:11:50,325 --> 01:11:52,122
This is a robbery.

845
01:11:52,205 --> 01:11:55,163
If nobody loses their head,
nobody will lose their head.

846
01:11:55,245 --> 01:11:58,920
If you would all
lie down on the floor, please.

847
01:11:59,005 --> 01:12:03,123
Who will win a prize
for keeping their cool?

848
01:12:03,205 --> 01:12:06,800
Sir, would you do the honours?
Put the cash in that bag.

849
01:12:06,885 --> 01:12:09,957
You're going to have a great
story to tell your friends.

850
01:12:10,045 --> 01:12:13,242
Or you'll have a tag
on your toe. You decide.

851
01:12:13,325 --> 01:12:15,236
Hurry up.

852
01:12:15,325 --> 01:12:19,000
Ma'am, would you be quiet?
Sir, get down, please.

853
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,679
Just get real comfortable.

854
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:25,604
Throw in a couple bottles
of Wild Turkey.

855
01:12:25,685 --> 01:12:27,721
Yes, ma'am.

856
01:12:29,165 --> 01:12:31,201
Now you get down, too.

857
01:12:31,285 --> 01:12:33,799
Thank you all
for your cooperation.

858
01:12:33,885 --> 01:12:37,764
Stay on the floor,
and have a good day.

859
01:12:40,685 --> 01:12:41,800
Jesus Christ.

860
01:12:41,885 --> 01:12:43,238
- Good God!
- My Lord.

861
01:12:53,928 --> 01:12:56,761
Hey, Louise,
you better slow down.

862
01:12:56,848 --> 01:13:00,363
I'd die if we get caught
over a speeding ticket.

863
01:13:00,448 --> 01:13:03,804
For the first time,
I wish this car wasn't green.

864
01:13:05,088 --> 01:13:07,602
Should we be driving
in broad daylight?

865
01:13:07,688 --> 01:13:10,248
I want to put some
distance between us

866
01:13:10,328 --> 01:13:13,081
and the scene
of our last goddamn crime!

867
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:19,441
Oh, man, you wouldn't
have believed it.

868
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:23,567
It was like l'd been
doing it all my life.

869
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:28,121
- Think you found your calling?
- Maybe. Maybe.

870
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:30,244
The call of the wild!

871
01:13:32,328 --> 01:13:36,162
- You are disturbed!
- I believe I am.

872
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:53,025
Thelma, don't you litter.

873
01:13:55,672 --> 01:13:59,665
Shoot! This always happens
when you're in a hurry.

874
01:14:01,832 --> 01:14:04,551
You going to stay drunk all day?

875
01:14:04,632 --> 01:14:06,668
Try to.

876
01:14:12,352 --> 01:14:14,229
Oh, isn't that nice?

877
01:14:14,312 --> 01:14:16,542
Truck drivers
are always so nice.

878
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:24,430
Oh, look. How original.

879
01:14:36,992 --> 01:14:41,349
- Man, that's disgusting!
- You pig. Just a fucking pig.

880
01:14:41,432 --> 01:14:45,789
- What's he got to do that for?
- They think we like it.

881
01:14:48,072 --> 01:14:50,222
They think it turns us on.

882
01:15:25,952 --> 01:15:28,910
- James Lennox?
- Yeah. Who wants to know?

883
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:31,222
Arkansas State Police.

884
01:16:47,712 --> 01:16:49,509
What?

885
01:16:49,592 --> 01:16:53,471
- Call Darryl.
- What for?

886
01:16:57,792 --> 01:17:00,306
Find out if he knows anything.

887
01:17:00,392 --> 01:17:02,906
If you think he does, hang up,

888
01:17:02,992 --> 01:17:05,950
because the phone's
probably tapped.

889
01:17:06,032 --> 01:17:09,741
Tapped the phone?
What are you talking about?

890
01:17:09,832 --> 01:17:12,904
Come on! Murder one
and armed robbery?

891
01:17:12,992 --> 01:17:15,745
We can't even say
it was self-defence?

892
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:19,427
- It wasn't. We walked away.
- But they don't know that.

893
01:17:19,512 --> 01:17:23,710
I'll say he raped me
and you had to shoot him.

894
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:25,908
- It won't work.
- Why not?

895
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:27,983
There's no physical evidence.

896
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:32,862
We can't even prove by now
that he touched you.

897
01:17:32,952 --> 01:17:37,150
God! The law is some
tricky shit, isn't it?

898
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:43,670
How do you know
about all this stuff?

899
01:17:43,752 --> 01:17:46,266
What would we say
about the robbery?.

900
01:17:46,352 --> 01:17:49,025
There's no such thing
as justifiable robbery.

901
01:17:49,112 --> 01:17:51,672
All right!
Where did you get this?

902
01:17:51,752 --> 01:17:53,549
Stole it.

903
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,316
- Who's the nut?
- Mrs Dickinson's husband.

904
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:20,076
Well, shit twice
and fall back in it. God!

905
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,312
Where did you get the $6,60O?

906
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,714
A friend.

907
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,756
A gentleman told us

908
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,628
he delivered close to that
amount to Louise Sawyer.

909
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,757
- Do you know her?
- Uh, yes, sir.

910
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,071
I believe she's the woman
driving the car.

911
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,911
He said he took her
to an Oklahoma City motel.

912
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,911
He says he met a man.

913
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,037
He identified you
from mug shots.

914
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:54,432
He also said you
and Mrs Dickinson seemed close.

915
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,590
Is that true?

916
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:01,754
Well, sir, you might say
we had a meeting of the minds.

917
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,551
Are you aware they are wanted
in connection with a murder?

918
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,359
Murder? What, Thelma? Damn!

919
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:14,433
Did they indicate
they were running from the law?.

920
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,479
Now that you mention it,
they seemed jumpy.

921
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,391
You know what?

922
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,436
What?

923
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,637
- You're irritating me.
- Me, too.

924
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,793
That will happen. You two boys
have a lot in common.

925
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,030
Maybe I should leave the room.

926
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,396
I got a better idea.

927
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,599
Mind if I speak to him alone?

928
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,793
What did I do?
Nothing, that's what.

929
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,158
This is a crock of shit,
Mr Johnny-fucking-law.

930
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,957
Son, I got a feeling
about something.

931
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,270
- Yeah?
- I want your opinion.

932
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,196
Do you think Thelma would have
committed armed robbery

933
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,350
if you hadn't taken their money?

934
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,350
Get your foot off that table.

935
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,508
Cat got your tongue?

936
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,149
No. How do you know I took it?

937
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,912
How do you know...

938
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,635
Don't fucking lie to me!

939
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,713
There's two girls out there
that had a chance.

940
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,396
You've screwed it up for them.
They're in serious trouble.

941
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,678
I'll hold you responsible
if anything happens to them.

942
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,274
I got no feeling for you.

943
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,272
You'll either tell me
everything you know

944
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,158
so there's a chance
I can help them,

945
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:10,711
or I'll be all over you
like a fly on shit.

946
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,473
Your misery will be
my mission in life.

947
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,118
Yes, sir.

948
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,072
- OK?
- Yeah. That's right.

949
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,515
We understand each other? OK.

950
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,479
- Mr Dickinson?
- Yeah?

951
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,791
Would you hang on?
I want a word with you.

952
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,677
I like your wife.

953
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,912
Come back here, you little shit!

954
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,037
Come here! Come here!

955
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,751
I'll kill you!

956
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:14,132
- What will it be, ladies?
- Fill her up. There you go.

957
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:19,249
Excuse me. Do you have a phone?

958
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:23,097
Thank you.

959
01:22:23,179 --> 01:22:25,090
Thelma, listen up.

960
01:22:25,179 --> 01:22:27,409
If you think he knows,

961
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:30,059
I want you to hang up.

962
01:23:06,739 --> 01:23:08,013
Hello.

963
01:23:08,099 --> 01:23:09,851
Darryl, it's me.

964
01:23:09,939 --> 01:23:11,418
Thelma, hello!

965
01:23:13,939 --> 01:23:15,611
- He knows.
- Shit!

966
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,008
I need more time.

967
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:22,330
What? All I said was hello.

968
01:23:46,379 --> 01:23:48,256
Darryl, this is Louise.

969
01:23:48,339 --> 01:23:51,251
- Let me talk to the police.
- Hey, Louise.

970
01:23:51,339 --> 01:23:56,413
- Let me talk to the police.
- There's no police here.

971
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:59,138
Where are you girls, anyway?

972
01:23:59,219 --> 01:24:02,973
Will you let me talk
to whoever's in charge.

973
01:24:04,019 --> 01:24:06,613
Hello, Miss Sawyer?

974
01:24:06,699 --> 01:24:10,009
I'm Hal Slocombe,
Arkansas State Police.

975
01:24:10,099 --> 01:24:11,851
How are you?

976
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:13,975
Well, I've been better.

977
01:24:14,059 --> 01:24:18,018
- Be careful with that gun.
- Yes, sir, I know.

978
01:24:18,099 --> 01:24:20,488
You girls are in some hot water.

979
01:24:20,579 --> 01:24:24,811
- You both OK?
- Yes, sir. We're both fine.

980
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:28,494
Good. You want to tell me
what happened?

981
01:24:28,579 --> 01:24:31,093
Sure, over coffee
some time. I'll buy.

982
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:35,138
Neither one of you
are charged with murder yet.

983
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:38,256
You're still wanted
for questioning.

984
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:42,571
Although now Mrs Dickinson
is wanted for armed robbery.

985
01:24:44,299 --> 01:24:48,258
No kidding. We gotta go.
I'll call you back.

986
01:24:48,339 --> 01:24:50,250
You won't make it to Mexico.

987
01:24:50,339 --> 01:24:54,696
We should talk. Please.
I want to help you.

988
01:24:55,539 --> 01:24:57,530
Shit.

989
01:24:57,619 --> 01:25:01,009
That JD kid is a little shit.

990
01:25:01,779 --> 01:25:03,815
What?

991
01:25:05,019 --> 01:25:09,137
Thelma, how do they know
we're going to Mexico?

992
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:14,657
You told that thieving
little shit where we're going?

993
01:25:16,259 --> 01:25:20,218
I just told him,
if he ever got to Mexico,

994
01:25:20,299 --> 01:25:22,415
he should look us up.

995
01:25:22,499 --> 01:25:25,013
But I asked him not to tell.

996
01:25:25,099 --> 01:25:29,297
I thought he would
not tell anybody.

997
01:25:29,379 --> 01:25:33,895
Why? What's he got to lose,
except my life savings.

998
01:25:33,979 --> 01:25:36,095
Thelma, God damn it!

999
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:39,251
Look, l'm sorry.

1000
01:25:39,339 --> 01:25:42,456
We had only two things
going for us.

1001
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:46,054
Nobody knew where we were
or where we were going.

1002
01:25:46,139 --> 01:25:48,448
Now one thing is gone!

1003
01:25:57,259 --> 01:26:00,251
Thelma, you got to stop
talking to people.

1004
01:26:00,339 --> 01:26:02,250
Stop being so open.

1005
01:26:02,339 --> 01:26:04,648
We're fugitives now, right?

1006
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:07,207
Let's start behaving like that.

1007
01:26:07,299 --> 01:26:08,618
Right.

1008
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:10,849
Thank you.

1009
01:26:12,699 --> 01:26:14,655
I was wondering...

1010
01:26:14,739 --> 01:26:17,572
Of course I want you to go.

1011
01:26:17,659 --> 01:26:21,129
That's what's worrying you.
Please don't think...

1012
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:26,213
No. I knew you'd want me
to take the job, but...

1013
01:26:29,339 --> 01:26:30,692
Sorry.

1014
01:26:30,779 --> 01:26:33,418
Let's do it.
Let's get married.

1015
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:46,173
- My God, this is beautiful.
- It surely is.

1016
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:48,618
I always wanted to travel.

1017
01:26:48,702 --> 01:26:50,772
I never got the opportunity.

1018
01:26:52,022 --> 01:26:53,933
You got it now.

1019
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:59,692
What's going on?

1020
01:29:03,582 --> 01:29:05,140
Nothing.

1021
01:29:17,462 --> 01:29:21,057
Well, we don't need
the east coast any more.

1022
01:29:24,582 --> 01:29:28,416
Hey, look who it is.
It's that guy.

1023
01:29:28,502 --> 01:29:30,732
Just ignore him.

1024
01:29:32,102 --> 01:29:36,095
Hey, baby! I'm your
captain muff diver!

1025
01:29:36,182 --> 01:29:40,494
Your storm trooper of love!

1026
01:29:45,702 --> 01:29:47,693
I ignored him.

1027
01:30:26,062 --> 01:30:27,859
What?

1028
01:30:27,942 --> 01:30:30,297
- What?
- Harlan.

1029
01:30:31,702 --> 01:30:33,260
What about him?

1030
01:30:33,342 --> 01:30:36,300
Nothing. Just the...

1031
01:30:37,222 --> 01:30:41,056
Just the look
on his face when...

1032
01:30:41,142 --> 01:30:42,860
What?

1033
01:30:42,942 --> 01:30:45,979
He sure wasn't expecting that.

1034
01:30:49,382 --> 01:30:51,373
"Suck my dick!"

1035
01:30:53,982 --> 01:30:55,813
Thelma, it's not funny.

1036
01:30:57,222 --> 01:30:58,974
I know.

1037
01:31:06,222 --> 01:31:08,452
It happened to you, didn't it?

1038
01:31:10,022 --> 01:31:12,377
What are you talking about?

1039
01:31:12,462 --> 01:31:14,498
In Texas.

1040
01:31:14,582 --> 01:31:17,813
I mean, that's what happened,
isn't it?

1041
01:31:17,902 --> 01:31:20,052
You was raped.

1042
01:31:24,582 --> 01:31:26,413
Look, l'm warning you.

1043
01:31:26,502 --> 01:31:29,778
Just drop it. I'm not
gonna talk about that.

1044
01:31:29,862 --> 01:31:31,853
You understand?

1045
01:31:31,942 --> 01:31:34,410
- Yeah.
- I'm not talking about it.

1046
01:31:34,502 --> 01:31:37,812
- Understand?
- Yeah. OK, Louise.

1047
01:31:42,302 --> 01:31:44,372
It's OK.

1048
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:49,579
It's OK.

1049
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:26,044
Shit. Thelma,
we're getting pulled over.

1050
01:32:27,686 --> 01:32:29,802
Shit. Shit.

1051
01:32:29,886 --> 01:32:32,844
- What should we do?
- I don't know!

1052
01:32:32,926 --> 01:32:36,521
Maybe he's just going
to give me a ticket.

1053
01:32:37,326 --> 01:32:41,399
Oh, God, please
don't let us get caught, God.

1054
01:32:41,486 --> 01:32:43,636
I'll pull over.

1055
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:01,566
Turn off your engine.

1056
01:33:07,406 --> 01:33:09,362
He's putting on his hat.

1057
01:33:20,806 --> 01:33:24,515
God, he's a Nazi.
He's walking this way.

1058
01:33:31,406 --> 01:33:32,998
Hello, officer.

1059
01:33:33,086 --> 01:33:35,077
Is there a problem?

1060
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:37,521
Let me see your licence, please.

1061
01:33:37,606 --> 01:33:39,164
Right.

1062
01:33:40,686 --> 01:33:42,085
Here it is.

1063
01:33:42,166 --> 01:33:44,441
Take it out
of your wallet, please.

1064
01:33:44,526 --> 01:33:46,164
All right.

1065
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,476
I told you to slow down.

1066
01:33:48,566 --> 01:33:51,000
Officer, I told her
to slow down.

1067
01:33:51,086 --> 01:33:53,725
- How fast was I going?
- About 110.

1068
01:33:54,726 --> 01:33:56,956
Get out of the car, please.

1069
01:33:57,046 --> 01:33:58,525
Sure.

1070
01:34:01,726 --> 01:34:05,036
- Come with me, please.
- Yes, sir.

1071
01:34:07,246 --> 01:34:09,202
This your vehicle?

1072
01:34:09,286 --> 01:34:11,322
Yes, sir, that is.

1073
01:34:13,006 --> 01:34:14,837
Get in the car, please.

1074
01:34:16,246 --> 01:34:20,876
- Yes, sir. Front or the back?
- Front.

1075
01:34:23,806 --> 01:34:26,843
Want to take off
your eyewear, please?

1076
01:34:26,926 --> 01:34:28,405
Yes, sir.

1077
01:34:31,646 --> 01:34:33,602
Am I in trouble, officer?

1078
01:34:33,686 --> 01:34:36,644
Yes, ma'am, you're in
a lot of trouble.

1079
01:34:37,486 --> 01:34:39,522
This is 9-8...

1080
01:34:39,606 --> 01:34:43,201
Step back and get
in your car, please.

1081
01:34:43,926 --> 01:34:46,679
Officer, I am
so sorry about this.

1082
01:34:46,766 --> 01:34:48,836
Would you let go of that?

1083
01:34:48,926 --> 01:34:51,315
Now, I really, really apologise,

1084
01:34:51,406 --> 01:34:54,523
but put your hands
on the steering wheel.

1085
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:56,597
If you get on that radio,

1086
01:34:56,686 --> 01:34:58,916
you'll find out we're wanted
in two states

1087
01:34:59,006 --> 01:35:02,043
and probably considered
armed and dangerous.

1088
01:35:02,126 --> 01:35:05,038
Then our plan's going
to be shot to hell.

1089
01:35:05,126 --> 01:35:07,162
Louise, take his gun.

1090
01:35:08,366 --> 01:35:11,278
- Take his gun, Louise.
- Right.

1091
01:35:11,366 --> 01:35:13,197
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1092
01:35:13,286 --> 01:35:15,356
Step out of the car, please.

1093
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:20,284
Three days ago,

1094
01:35:20,366 --> 01:35:23,403
neither of us would pull
a stunt like this,

1095
01:35:23,486 --> 01:35:26,364
but if you met my husband,
you'd understand why.

1096
01:35:26,446 --> 01:35:29,995
Put your hands on your
head, please. Louise.

1097
01:35:30,086 --> 01:35:32,441
- What?
- Shoot the radio.

1098
01:35:36,126 --> 01:35:38,799
The police radio, Louise!

1099
01:35:38,886 --> 01:35:40,604
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

1100
01:35:43,406 --> 01:35:44,839
Got it.

1101
01:35:44,926 --> 01:35:48,714
All right. Step to the back
of the car, please.

1102
01:35:49,566 --> 01:35:51,238
Louise, get the keys.

1103
01:35:56,926 --> 01:35:59,042
God! What happened?

1104
01:35:59,126 --> 01:36:00,798
Air holes.

1105
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:02,638
Open the trunk.

1106
01:36:04,246 --> 01:36:07,079
Shit, Thelma,
who'd have thought it?

1107
01:36:07,166 --> 01:36:09,202
Step into the trunk, please.

1108
01:36:11,806 --> 01:36:14,195
Please! I have a wife and kids.

1109
01:36:14,286 --> 01:36:16,436
You do? Well, you're lucky.

1110
01:36:16,526 --> 01:36:19,404
Be sweet to them,
especially your wife.

1111
01:36:19,486 --> 01:36:23,638
My husband wasn't sweet to me,
look how I turned out.

1112
01:36:23,726 --> 01:36:26,559
Oh, wait a second. Excuse me.

1113
01:36:26,646 --> 01:36:30,525
Officer, could I have
your belt, please?

1114
01:36:31,766 --> 01:36:34,519
- Extra ammo.
- Good idea.

1115
01:36:34,966 --> 01:36:37,400
Could I trade glasses with you?

1116
01:36:38,806 --> 01:36:41,115
Thanks. Is that it?

1117
01:36:44,406 --> 01:36:47,955
- I'm real sorry about this.
- I apologise also.

1118
01:36:50,486 --> 01:36:51,760
Go.

1119
01:36:56,446 --> 01:36:58,801
- You ready?
- Hit it.

1120
01:37:03,246 --> 01:37:05,157
I know it's crazy...

1121
01:37:05,246 --> 01:37:08,556
but I feel like I got
a knack for this shit.

1122
01:37:08,646 --> 01:37:10,602
I believe you do.

1123
01:37:12,046 --> 01:37:13,843
Drive like hell.

1124
01:37:20,326 --> 01:37:23,875
I can't figure out
if these girls are real smart

1125
01:37:23,966 --> 01:37:25,877
or just real lucky.

1126
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:29,754
Brains will only get you so far,
and luck always runs out.

1127
01:37:33,038 --> 01:37:35,996
Louise, are we still
going to Mexico?

1128
01:37:36,078 --> 01:37:37,067
Yeah.

1129
01:37:37,158 --> 01:37:40,389
Then aren't we going
in the wrong direction?

1130
01:37:40,478 --> 01:37:43,595
If you take
a state policeman's gun

1131
01:37:43,678 --> 01:37:45,828
and lock him in the trunk,

1132
01:37:45,918 --> 01:37:48,671
it's best just
to leave the state.

1133
01:37:51,678 --> 01:37:53,669
Don't dent my car!

1134
01:37:57,958 --> 01:37:59,994
I think I fucked up.

1135
01:38:01,438 --> 01:38:04,828
I got us in a situation
where we could get killed.

1136
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:09,389
I don't know why
I didn't go to the police.

1137
01:38:09,478 --> 01:38:11,708
You know why. You already said.

1138
01:38:11,798 --> 01:38:13,754
What did I say, again?

1139
01:38:13,838 --> 01:38:15,749
Nobody would believe us.

1140
01:38:15,838 --> 01:38:19,069
We'd still have
our lives ruined.

1141
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:22,592
- Know what else?
- What?

1142
01:38:22,678 --> 01:38:27,433
If you hadn't come out, that guy
would have hurt me a lot worse.

1143
01:38:27,518 --> 01:38:31,909
Probably nothing
would have happened to him.

1144
01:38:31,998 --> 01:38:34,307
They would've said
I asked for it.

1145
01:38:34,398 --> 01:38:38,437
My life would have been
ruined worse than it is now.

1146
01:38:38,518 --> 01:38:40,793
At least now I'm having fun.

1147
01:38:41,638 --> 01:38:44,948
I'm not sorry that
son-of-a-bitch is dead.

1148
01:38:45,038 --> 01:38:47,791
I'm sorry you did it
and not me.

1149
01:39:03,958 --> 01:39:07,394
- Hello.
- Let me talk to Slocombe.

1150
01:39:07,478 --> 01:39:09,912
She wants to talk to you.

1151
01:39:15,278 --> 01:39:16,631
Hello, Louise.

1152
01:39:16,718 --> 01:39:19,027
How are things going out there?

1153
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:22,872
Weird. We got some kind
of snowball effect happening.

1154
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:25,916
You're still
on the face of the earth.

1155
01:39:25,998 --> 01:39:29,707
We're not in the middle
of nowhere but we can see it.

1156
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:35,270
I swear! Louise,
I almost feel like I know you.

1157
01:39:35,358 --> 01:39:38,828
- Well, you don't.
- You're getting in deeper.

1158
01:39:38,918 --> 01:39:41,352
This thing was an accident.

1159
01:39:41,438 --> 01:39:45,226
I believe you. That's what
I want everybody to believe.

1160
01:39:45,318 --> 01:39:48,788
Trouble is, it doesn't
look like an accident,

1161
01:39:48,878 --> 01:39:52,268
and you're not here
to tell me about it.

1162
01:39:52,358 --> 01:39:54,189
Did Harlan Puckett...

1163
01:39:54,278 --> 01:39:56,234
I don't want to talk about it.

1164
01:39:56,318 --> 01:39:59,196
- You want to come in?
- I don't think so.

1165
01:39:59,278 --> 01:40:03,590
Then l'm sorry. We'll have
to charge you with murder.

1166
01:40:03,678 --> 01:40:06,431
Do you want
to come out of this alive?

1167
01:40:06,518 --> 01:40:10,477
Certain words and phrases
keep drifting through my mind.

1168
01:40:10,558 --> 01:40:13,595
Things like incarceration,
cavity search,

1169
01:40:13,678 --> 01:40:16,431
death by electrocution,
life imprisonment.

1170
01:40:16,518 --> 01:40:18,827
Do I want to come out alive?

1171
01:40:18,918 --> 01:40:21,034
I don't know. I...

1172
01:40:25,798 --> 01:40:29,711
I don't know. We're going
to have to think about that.

1173
01:40:29,798 --> 01:40:33,313
Louise...I'll do anything.

1174
01:40:36,118 --> 01:40:38,473
I know what's making you run.

1175
01:40:38,558 --> 01:40:41,436
I know what happened
to you in Texas.

1176
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,914
Come on, Louise.

1177
01:40:50,038 --> 01:40:52,108
Don't blow it.

1178
01:40:52,198 --> 01:40:55,474
- We got it.
- Give it to me.

1179
01:41:02,358 --> 01:41:04,553
Max, you got to take me there.

1180
01:41:04,638 --> 01:41:06,196
No. Sorry.

1181
01:41:06,278 --> 01:41:11,398
- I'm the only one...
- You're no good to me now.

1182
01:41:11,478 --> 01:41:14,914
I don't want anybody
losing their heads.

1183
01:41:14,998 --> 01:41:18,707
These girls are going
to get shot.

1184
01:41:30,806 --> 01:41:32,034
What?

1185
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:35,522
You're not going
to give up on me?

1186
01:41:35,606 --> 01:41:37,358
What do you mean?

1187
01:41:37,446 --> 01:41:40,483
You won't make a deal
with that guy?.

1188
01:41:40,566 --> 01:41:43,558
I mean, I just want to know.

1189
01:41:44,646 --> 01:41:47,399
Thelma, l'm not
making any deals.

1190
01:41:51,726 --> 01:41:54,718
I'd understand
if you was thinking about it.

1191
01:41:54,806 --> 01:41:58,003
You got something
to go back for - Jimmy.

1192
01:41:58,086 --> 01:41:59,997
Jimmy's not an option.

1193
01:42:03,046 --> 01:42:05,958
But...l don't know...

1194
01:42:06,886 --> 01:42:11,402
Something's, like,
crossed over in me,

1195
01:42:12,646 --> 01:42:14,682
and I can't go back.

1196
01:42:15,726 --> 01:42:19,036
I mean... I just couldn't live.

1197
01:42:19,126 --> 01:42:22,004
I know. I know what you mean.

1198
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:28,444
Anyway, we don't want to end up
on the damn Geraldo Show.

1199
01:42:36,886 --> 01:42:40,196
They're charging us with murder.

1200
01:42:42,966 --> 01:42:46,879
We got to figure out if we want
to come in dead or alive.

1201
01:42:48,326 --> 01:42:51,602
Gosh. Didn't he say
anything positive at all?

1202
01:43:17,086 --> 01:43:18,678
You awake?

1203
01:43:18,766 --> 01:43:21,917
You could call it that.
My eyes are open.

1204
01:43:23,046 --> 01:43:25,685
Me, too. I feel awake.

1205
01:43:25,926 --> 01:43:28,998
- Good.
- Wide awake.

1206
01:43:29,086 --> 01:43:32,044
I don't remember
ever feeling this awake.

1207
01:43:32,126 --> 01:43:36,165
Know what I mean?
Everything looks different.

1208
01:43:37,046 --> 01:43:40,880
You feel like you got
something to look forward to?

1209
01:43:42,086 --> 01:43:45,681
We'll be drinking margaritas
by the sea, mamacita.

1210
01:43:45,766 --> 01:43:47,802
We could change our names.

1211
01:43:47,886 --> 01:43:52,243
- We could live in a hacienda.
- I'll work at Club Med.

1212
01:43:54,726 --> 01:43:58,196
What deal could that cop
come up with to beat that?

1213
01:43:58,286 --> 01:44:00,880
- Have to be good.
- Damn good.

1214
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:39,220
My God, Louise, look!
See if that's him.

1215
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:43,667
It's definitely him.

1216
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:45,627
Pass him.

1217
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:06,421
You ready for a big dick?

1218
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:19,946
Hi, there. You all right?

1219
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:21,748
We're fine. How are you?

1220
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:23,707
Great!

1221
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:26,981
Are you girls ready
to get serious?

1222
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:30,861
I think so.

1223
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:33,749
Follow us.

1224
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:31,187
Where are you going?

1225
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:32,589
Fresno.

1226
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:34,706
We've seen you all over.

1227
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:38,146
Take off those shades.
I want to see your eyes.

1228
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:41,222
Yeah, I been seeing you, too.

1229
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:44,620
Yeah. We think you have
really bad manners.

1230
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:50,105
Behaving like that
with women you don't even know!

1231
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:54,901
What if someone
did that to your mom?

1232
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:57,823
Or your sister? Or your wife?

1233
01:46:59,070 --> 01:47:01,106
What are you talking about?

1234
01:47:01,190 --> 01:47:03,624
You know what I'm talking about.

1235
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:08,380
That business with your tongue
is disgusting.

1236
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:11,701
What does pointing
to your lap mean?

1237
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:16,068
"I want to show you
what a fat slob I am"?

1238
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:17,742
Or "Suck my dick"?

1239
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:20,663
- You women are crazy!
- Right.

1240
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:22,980
We think you should apologise.

1241
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:25,425
I ain't apologising for shit!

1242
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:26,863
Say sorry.

1243
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:29,747
Fuck that!

1244
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:39,542
Say you're sorry,
or I'll make you fucking sorry.

1245
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:41,621
Oh, Jesus.

1246
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:44,543
I bet you called us
beavers on your radio.

1247
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:46,427
Sure did.

1248
01:47:46,510 --> 01:47:51,300
- I hate being called a beaver.
- You going to apologise?

1249
01:47:53,150 --> 01:47:55,106
Fuck you!

1250
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:07,386
God damn, you bitch!

1251
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:12,624
- I don't think he'll apologise.
- I don't think so.

1252
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:29,901
You bitches!
You bitches from hell!

1253
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:31,708
Goddamn it!

1254
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:34,941
You're going to have
to pay for this!

1255
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:02,580
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

1256
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:04,547
Off the TV.

1257
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:08,782
- Where did you learn?
- Texas.

1258
01:50:09,918 --> 01:50:13,706
Hello? Hello?
I'm a police officer.

1259
01:50:15,558 --> 01:50:18,516
The keys are over there.

1260
01:50:35,977 --> 01:50:41,051
Red hair, brown eyes.
5' 7" tall, 120 pounds.

1261
01:50:41,137 --> 01:50:43,605
Suspect Thelma Lauren Dickinson.

1262
01:50:44,577 --> 01:50:48,206
I got this guy running
around a burning truck.

1263
01:50:48,297 --> 01:50:52,256
Red hair, green eyes.
5'10" tall.

1264
01:50:52,337 --> 01:50:55,454
Both subjects armed
and extremely dangerous.

1265
01:50:55,537 --> 01:50:57,289
Approach with caution.

1266
01:50:59,873 --> 01:51:02,865
..on felony warrants
for armed robbery,

1267
01:51:02,953 --> 01:51:05,547
kidnapping
a law-enforcement officer,

1268
01:51:05,633 --> 01:51:07,589
assault with a deadly weapon.

1269
01:51:07,673 --> 01:51:10,983
Suspect driving,
Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.

1270
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:30,344
Think they saw us?

1271
01:51:34,113 --> 01:51:38,425
I don't think so.
Get off just in case.

1272
01:52:18,993 --> 01:52:20,984
Got your seat belt on?

1273
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:26,271
This is 112 in pursuit
of a green Thunderbird.

1274
01:52:29,553 --> 01:52:31,271
Oh, shit.

1275
01:52:35,113 --> 01:52:37,707
I have the suspects in sight.

1276
01:52:43,313 --> 01:52:44,951
Stay in position.

1277
01:52:50,593 --> 01:52:52,743
This is all my fault.

1278
01:52:52,833 --> 01:52:55,711
You should know by now
it wasn't.

1279
01:52:55,793 --> 01:53:00,662
Louise, no matter what happens,
I'm glad I came with you.

1280
01:53:00,833 --> 01:53:02,425
Shit.

1281
01:53:13,273 --> 01:53:15,628
He was in the middle
of the road!

1282
01:53:28,553 --> 01:53:30,544
Hold on!

1283
01:53:52,473 --> 01:53:55,943
- Everything will be shitty now.
- Unbearable.

1284
01:53:56,033 --> 01:53:59,264
- Nothing left to lose.
- You're so positive!

1285
01:55:01,996 --> 01:55:03,748
You're a good friend.

1286
01:55:03,836 --> 01:55:05,713
You, too, sweetie.

1287
01:55:07,436 --> 01:55:10,428
How do you like
the vacation so far?

1288
01:55:15,156 --> 01:55:17,795
I guess I went a little crazy.

1289
01:55:17,876 --> 01:55:19,787
You've always been crazy.

1290
01:55:19,876 --> 01:55:23,186
This is just your first chance
to express yourself.

1291
01:55:28,356 --> 01:55:29,869
Good drivin'.

1292
01:55:32,076 --> 01:55:33,668
Thanks.

1293
01:56:43,156 --> 01:56:47,308
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell is this?

1294
01:56:47,396 --> 01:56:49,705
I don't know.

1295
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:53,266
I think it's
the goddamn Grand Canyon.

1296
01:56:54,436 --> 01:56:56,904
Isn't it beautiful?

1297
01:56:57,836 --> 01:57:00,873
Yeah. It's something
else, all right.

1298
01:58:03,092 --> 01:58:06,687
My God. It looks like the army.

1299
01:58:06,772 --> 01:58:08,330
All this for us?

1300
01:58:08,412 --> 01:58:11,484
Don't let them
shoot those girls.

1301
01:58:11,572 --> 01:58:13,688
This is too much.

1302
01:58:13,772 --> 01:58:16,047
These women are armed, Hal.

1303
01:58:16,132 --> 01:58:19,044
These boys know
what they're doing.

1304
01:58:20,092 --> 01:58:22,560
Place your hands in plain view.

1305
01:58:22,652 --> 01:58:25,291
Failure to obey that command

1306
01:58:25,372 --> 01:58:29,285
will be considered an act
of aggression against us.

1307
01:58:30,932 --> 01:58:32,650
I repeat -

1308
01:58:32,732 --> 01:58:35,041
turn your engine off.

1309
01:58:35,132 --> 01:58:37,600
Place your hands in plain view.

1310
01:58:41,572 --> 01:58:45,451
- What are you doing?
- I'm not giving up.

1311
01:58:45,532 --> 01:58:47,523
You've got to do something.

1312
01:58:47,612 --> 01:58:50,922
How many times
must they be fucked over?

1313
01:58:51,012 --> 01:58:53,765
Pull yourself together.

1314
01:58:53,852 --> 01:58:56,730
Don't make me
sorry I brought you!

1315
01:58:56,812 --> 01:58:58,643
Damn it!

1316
01:58:59,892 --> 01:59:04,283
Cut your engine off and place
your hands in plain view.

1317
01:59:09,972 --> 01:59:13,328
OK, then, listen.
Let's not get caught.

1318
01:59:13,412 --> 01:59:16,085
What are you talking about?

1319
01:59:18,172 --> 01:59:20,163
Let's keep going.

1320
01:59:20,252 --> 01:59:22,561
What do you mean?

1321
01:59:25,932 --> 01:59:27,570
Go.

1322
01:59:32,412 --> 01:59:34,130
You sure?

1323
01:59:37,012 --> 01:59:39,890
Yeah. Hit it.
