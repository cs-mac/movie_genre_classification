There was a strange man in our pool.

160
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,276
In my pool.

161
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:31,030
Oh, yes, dear Stepmother.
In your pool.

162
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:36,578
And we were just talking, and
all of a sudden, he just disappeared.

163
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:40,873
- What do you mean, "disappeared"?
- Just like I say, Mother... Stepmother.

164
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:44,585
We were there talking
and he was just gone.

165
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,212
Pshtwaa...

166
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:48,464
And there he wasn't, and...

167
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:51,008
- Pshtwaa...
- Pshtwaa...

168
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,513
How do we make
Corkhead here disappear?

169
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:59,225
If the princess sees him, she'll think
there's insanity in the family.

170
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:03,604
But this is true. I'm not making it up.
I was standing there talking to him.

171
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:06,983
In fact, he told me
all about the ball we're having.

172
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:10,778
And he said it to me
before the paper even came out.

173
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:12,905
You're cracking, kid.

174
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:17,076
Just like those dreams you have
about your old man.

175
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:22,164
Is that so, Mr Smart Alec?
Well, those dreams are true.

176
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:25,459
Fella's father's always telling him
that he's rich.

177
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:28,170
- Isn't he, Fella?
- Yes, Stepmother dear.

178
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:31,257
Yes. Except that I always
wake up too soon.

179
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:35,469
I don't think you ever woke up.
You're a spook. Beat it!

180
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,429
Yeah, but all I...

181
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:41,767
OK. I'll set the table for dinner.

182
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,983
Mother dear, this door...

183
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,653
...is open.
And I'll leave while I can.

184
00:17:56,699 --> 00:18:00,703
Now... about the fortune I'm spending.

193
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,243
Those dreams he has are true.

194
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:50,913
His father's ghost is trying to tell him
where he hid his fortune.

195
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:54,708
He'll be rich if he finds the money.
And we'll be paupers.

196
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:58,337
So it's important
for Rupert to marry the princess.

197
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:01,090
I see how important it is.

198
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:04,843
I haven't the confidence
in Rupert's charm

199
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:07,805
for the opposite sex
that you have, Mother.

200
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:13,060
I think we should ensure our chances
by starting to be nice...

201
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:15,896
...to the Little Fella.

202
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,527
Of course.

203
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,656
Be nice to the Little Fella.

We're gonna eat now.

207
00:22:01,107 --> 00:22:03,193
It's gonna be...

208
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:09,783
Food.

209
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:13,662
Come on, we'll...

210
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:32,764
I'm hungry.

211
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:46,962
Fella...

212
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,766
Yes, dear Stepmother?

213
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:02,478
- You may serve the wine now, Fella.
- The wine.

214
00:24:58,283 --> 00:25:00,577
Will there be anything else,
Stepmother?

215
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,788
That's all, thank you.

216
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:22,557
Fella...

217
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:35,570
- Yes, Mother dear?
- Bring the sugar, please.

218
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,739
Yes, Stepmother.

219
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:56,174
In my coffee, Fella, please.

220
00:26:12,523 --> 00:26:15,735
- Anything else?
- That's all. Thank you, Fella.

221
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:17,653
You're welcome.

222
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:59,487
Fella...

223
00:27:00,738 --> 00:27:02,656
Ohh...!

224
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,252
Yes, Maximilian?

225
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,172
Light me.

226
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,424
Yeah, all right.

227
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:39,002
Maybe I should light it for you,
Maximilian.

228
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:49,554
Oh, there's a painful lip.

229
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:52,432
Could you pull on the lip, Max?
Just easy.

230
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,976
The hurting lip. Just...

231
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:56,644
ARGHH!

232
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:59,856
It's a hole.
There's a hole in my lip and it burns.

233
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:02,942
I'm tired and running
with a hole in my lip.

234
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:06,654
I can't eat my soup
with a hole in the lip.

235
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:16,080
I forgot to change.

236
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,552
Shall we retire?

237
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,688
Fella, we'll have our brandy
in the library.

238
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:43,607
The brandy in the lib... Yes.

239
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:50,823
And, Fella...
the prime rib was delicious.

240
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:53,159
The prime... You loved it?

241
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:55,703
Prime rib?

242
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,081
You loved the prime rib?

243
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,378
My ribs... was good?

244
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,883
I'm gonna faint.
Did you really love the prime rib?

245
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:12,094
Did you...? Did you...?
Was it...?

246
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:15,389
Did you like it a lot?
Or just a little lot?

247
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:16,932
Oh, I'm...

248
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:21,228
Oh, I worked very...
To my bones, fingers.

249
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:25,149
I'm glad you liked my meat prime.

250
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:28,193
I... Oh, thank you, oh, Mother,

251
00:30:28,402 --> 00:30:33,115
for enjoying my prime meat of ribs.
I'm so grateful to you all.

252
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:34,867
- Fella.
- Yes?

253
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:37,828
Tomorrow, I may take you
to play polo with me.

254
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,496
Polo?

255
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,123
Me, polo?

256
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:45,335
The gentleman's game.
Oh, thank you, Maxie.

257
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,755
And maybe you'd like to play
tennis and golf with us.

258
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:51,091
Oh, what wonderful brothers.

259
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,429
Two swell persons to have as my own,
my brothers own.

260
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:58,932
And Mother and brothers and all.

261
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:01,476
Fella, the brandy, please.

262
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,061
Oh, yes, Mother.

263
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,813
I'll... Excuse me.

264
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:07,441
To love the prime meat ribs.

265
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:13,238
It's a wonder... I'm so glad that you...
I'll hope to always have more of this.

266
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:19,286
Aren't you going too far, playing tennis
with him? And golf? And polo?

267
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:22,706
I'll make him so tired
he won't be able to wake up.

268
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,500
Then he'll finish his dream.

269
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:32,924
They loved the prime ribs.

270

loved in return."

272

273
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:46,354

A midnight cup of tea with

295
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:38,882
To have and hold

296
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:43,387
And sometimes disagree with

297

Oh, it's wonderful

298
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,023
To live for somebody

299
00:33:59,152 --> 00:34:03,490
And the most you have to give is

300
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:07,077
Your love

304
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,849

Where's our pigeon?

307
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:04,425
He's getting dressed
in one of my outfits. "Our" pigeon?

308
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:07,011
Max, I think your idea will work.

309
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,848
He'll never wake up
after the exercise I give him.

310
00:35:11,057 --> 00:35:13,559
I hope you make out as well
with the princess.

311
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:16,521
I'll try. I'm brushing up
at Arthur Murray's.

<i>(FELLA) Hey, Maxie, I'm dressed.</i>

313
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:36,624
Is that polo? That's the gentle...
It's not a very gentle gentleman.

314
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:40,378
I thought it was that game where
you hit the ball through that steel

315
00:35:40,586 --> 00:35:43,548
and it just goes.
But that's a... a high horse.

316
00:35:43,756 --> 00:35:49,095
I don't wanna be no gentle... game.
I don't need that.

00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:35,068
No, you're from the FBI.

00:46:35,277 --> 00:46:38,196

This is no game, Fella.

421
00:46:40,615 --> 00:46:45,203
I am exactly like
Cinderella's fairy godmother.

422
00:46:47,831 --> 00:46:53,044
As a matter of fact,
I personally handled Cindy's case.

423

You handled her case.

You mean, you would rather
have me sit down?

427
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:09,894
I hope this doesn't sound
like braggadocio,

428
00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:14,482
because really I'm a very modest
fairy godfather.

Oh.

430

that Cinderella had.

431
00:47:19,821 --> 00:47:21,823
No?

432
00:47:22,615 --> 00:47:24,909

- It was me.
- Yes.

435
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:34,711
You see, the women reporters
of that period wrote the story.

436
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:38,589
So naturally, they attributed
my magic to a woman.

437
00:47:38,798 --> 00:47:42,260
Women are strange, Fella.
They're like the Russians.

438
00:47:42,468 --> 00:47:45,013
They want credit
for inventing everything.

439
00:47:49,058 --> 00:47:52,645
Well, I... I... I like you.

- She's real? Touch her?

456
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:12,057

- Oh, oh, oh...
- You believe now, eh, Fella?

465
00:49:39,084 --> 00:49:41,378
No! I know the story of Cinderella.

466
00:49:41,586 --> 00:49:44,297
She didn't wear shoes,
she wore glass slippers.

It was so nice to see you again.

472
00:50:22,627 --> 00:50:26,047
So nice to see you again, Godfather.

473
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,758
Delighted to have met you, sire.

474
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:33,221
Oh, also very good to meet up you.

475
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:37,517
And you'll love living in a castle.
Castles are so roomy.

476
00:50:37,725 --> 00:50:41,145
So much more comfortable
than tract houses.

477
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,108
Yeah, that's true,
some houses are not the same as...

478
00:50:47,485 --> 00:50:48,987
Miss Person? Lady?

Goodbye, Cinderella.

480
00:50:53,157 --> 00:50:55,993
I mean, Mrs Charming.

481
00:50:57,328 --> 00:50:59,080
Goodbye.

482
00:50:59,831 --> 00:51:03,793
Me, in a castle? What did she mean,
I would live in a castle?

483
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:07,255
Fella, you do believe that
I'm your fairy godfather?

484
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:09,298
Yes, sire. Yes, sir, I do.

485
00:51:09,507 --> 00:51:13,177
- Then you'll believe what I tell you?
- Yes, without a doubt.

486
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:14,720
Good.

487
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:23,354
Fella, you have been chosen
to rectify all the great wrongs

488
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:26,190
brought about by the original
Cinderella story.

489
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:31,320
Through the centuries, women,
influenced by Cinderella, have waited

490
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:33,864
for their Prince Charmings
to come galloping

491
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:36,534
out of the wild blue yonder
on white horses

492
00:51:36,742 --> 00:51:39,829
to claim their hands in marriage.

493
00:51:40,037 --> 00:51:41,914
Yeah, I... I read that once.

494
00:51:42,123 --> 00:51:45,084
But there was only
one Prince Charming.

495
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:50,172
When he didn't appear, these women
married the closest available man.

496
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:52,591
They were forever after miserable,

497
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,012
because they always regretted it,
and they felt that...

498
00:51:57,221 --> 00:51:59,765
...that they had taken second best.

499
00:51:59,974 --> 00:52:03,435
But what is worse, they made
their poor husbands miserable

500
00:52:03,644 --> 00:52:06,980
because the poor fellow
wasn't a prince.

501
00:52:07,564 --> 00:52:09,691
Oh, the Cinderella legend

502
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,779
has brought nothing but dissatisfaction
to the hearts of women,

503
00:52:13,987 --> 00:52:16,532
and their husbands
have taken the brunt of it.

504
00:52:16,824 --> 00:52:22,204
- It's not fair.
- I won't bother you with statistics.

505
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:26,583
But the unhappy husbands
of the world are crying for help.

506
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:29,294
They're crying for a chance
to get even.

507
00:52:29,878 --> 00:52:32,005
It's time for a change.

508
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:37,344
And you have been chosen
to bring out that change.

509
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,640
Change? Out? Chosen me?
I'm...? Who chosen?

510
00:52:41,848 --> 00:52:44,393
You've been chosen
by the head man.

511
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:47,312
- The head man?
- The head man.

512
00:52:47,521 --> 00:52:51,274
The chairman of the board
of directors of all fairy godfathers.

513
00:52:51,483 --> 00:52:55,695
And the Society for the Prevention
of Distorting the Truth in Fairy Tales,

514
00:52:55,904 --> 00:52:58,907
and the Committee
for Sanity of Married Men.

515
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:01,993
Chairman of the board?
You had a meeting?

516
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:07,457
A meeting?
Why, we argued like a summit.

517
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:12,462
- There were some against you.
- What did I do to them?

518
00:53:12,671 --> 00:53:16,925
They thought the one chosen should
be tall, handsome and clever.

519
00:53:17,133 --> 00:53:18,927
But I fought for you.

520
00:53:19,135 --> 00:53:23,181
I said you were perfect for the task,
because you're ordinary.

521
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:27,435
You're not tall or handsome,
and you're anything but clever.

522
00:53:27,644 --> 00:53:30,313
Thank you, Godfather,
for taking my part.

523
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:32,232
That's all right.

524
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,776
- I appreciate it.
- Would you?

525
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:38,988
No, thank you.
The filters make me cough.

526
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:44,953
So you are the one
who is going to settle the score

527
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:49,415
for all the downtrodden married men,
and when we finish,

528
00:53:49,624 --> 00:53:53,127
married men will be able to look
their wives in the face -

529
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:57,715
that is, if they have their make-up on -
and put them in their place.

530
00:53:57,924 --> 00:54:02,512
I can hear the husbands saying,
"Why wasn't I lucky like Fella?

531
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,307
"He's not handsome,
he's not tall, he's not clever,

532
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:11,938
"but he ended up married to
a beautiful princess, instead of you."

533
00:54:12,146 --> 00:54:18,069
The men will be able to get even
for centuries of female abuse.

534
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:20,863
But best of all, the best part of it is

535
00:54:21,072 --> 00:54:26,285
men and women will learn to be
happy with each other as they are.

536
00:54:26,494 --> 00:54:31,582
I get it now. Ordinary people
will accept one another.

537
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:35,836
Ordinary people will be
satisfied with one another.

538
00:54:36,712 --> 00:54:41,509
Yeah. Sure. They won't be looking
around for something better.

That's the idea.

Yeah. "Boy, that Fella was lucky.

Everything. I'm surprised.

No, I'm not surprised.
I'm appalled by your lack of faith.

01:06:40,972 --> 01:06:43,849
Well, you see...
Let me explain. You see.

- The... the... I... I...
- Oh, I see.

642
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,272
That's why I changed this attire.

If you can no longer believe
in your fairy godfather,

to believe in the fairy godmother.

I'm awfully sorry, Fairy Godmother.

Well, I... I hope you forgive me.

- I believe you.
- Good.

649

That'll give me a chance
to get rid of this silly outfit.

650

I borrowed this from
a Hallowe'en witch I used to date.

- What?
- If you have red coat,

No. I think that would be
just a little too big for me.
