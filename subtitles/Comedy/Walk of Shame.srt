Or she's incapacitated,

Listen, you got a banana
or something?

610
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,441
I'm sorry.
This was a mistake.

611
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:55,112
I thought I was taking home
a really young, very cute guy.

612
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,481
You must mean my son.

613
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,283
Yeah, we get confused
all the time.

614
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:01,051
Don't worry about it.

615
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,486
Crazy night.
You can party.

616
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,388
Fuck.

617
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:11,094
Yeah. What you
think I'm doing?
I'm on the corner.

618
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,330
Yeah. Hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

619
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,266
What's up?
All right, cool.

620
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,201
Follow that guy
down there.

621
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,473
Yeah, baby, what's up?

622
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,576
Sometimes I wonder.

623
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,246
They like the fuckin'
Keystone Kops out there.

624
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,985
All right, later.

625
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,354
Sneaking up on me
is a bad idea.
No, no, no.

626
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,022
Hi. I'm not sneaking up.

627
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,724
I wasn't. I just--
No samples.

628
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:43,327
Keep your zombie ass moving.

629
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,262
I-I just need a little help.

630
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,363
Sir.

631
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,365
Now, I know you can see
I'm working,

632
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:51,034
and I'm sure you done
worked that ass
enough tonight.

633
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:55,305
You need
to get on home.
That's all I want to do.

634
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,374
And I don't want your drugs.

635
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:01,011
Excuse me?
Oh. I mean-- That was
a terrible assumption.

636
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,380
I mean, I don't know
if there's--
I wouldn't--

637
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:04,648
Yeah, you don't know.
You're right.

638
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,616
You need to forget
what you think I'm doing.

639
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,052
It's already forgotten.
I'm so sorry about that.

640
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,554
Um, I just want
to borrow your phone.

641
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,023
Can I please make a call
on your phone?

642
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,192
I'm pretty sure today might
be the most important day
of my life,

643
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,727
but I really need
to make a call.

644
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:18,395
Please, I'm--

645
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,598
I am not what you think I am.

646
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,066
I swear.

647
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,768
I'm a good girl.

648
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,607
Oh, shit.
You ain't that good.

649
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,644
The police said
if they find me again
they're gonna arrest me.

650
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:38,382
For what?
Being a good girl?


651
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,518
It was a misunderstanding--
at worst.

652
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,187
Five-0! Five-O!
Full team's coming.

653
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,223
Oh. You better get lost.

654
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:48,191
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

655
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,760
What the fuck
are you doing?

656
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,728
I'm getting lost.
Get lost somewhere else.

657
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,430
Where?
I don't know.

658
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,665
That's why they
call that shit lost.

659
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,268
Bitch, why are you so fast?

660
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,703
I ran track in high school.

661
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,441
Hang on. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

662
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,343
Hang on. Hey!

663
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:09,046
Fuckin' yellow-ass Terminator.

664
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,618
I've gotta go home.
What are you
still doing behind me?

665
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,120
- Get out of here, man!
- I need to get in here.

666
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,655
Get off me.
Get away from me, bitch.

667
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,759
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Just give me the phone.

668
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,128
You better go back out.
Go back out.
I can't go out there.

669
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,596
Go.
I can't go out there.

670
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,466
I can't. I can't
be caught out there.

671
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,771
Oh.
What the fuck
are you doing in here?

672
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:38,775
I was one of the ones
runnin' from the Five-O.

673
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:41,812
- Who the fuck are you?
- Yo, chill. Chill, chill.

674
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:45,115
- She with me.
- Yeah. I'm with him.
Yeah.

675
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,516
Just some dumb ho.

676
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:50,687
You fuckin' stupid?
Look at this bitch.

677
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:55,225
She a undercover cop
wearing what looks like
a Marc Jacobs dress.

678
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:57,627
You think some raggedy-ass
trick get her hands on that?

679
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,629
Hold the fuck up.

680
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,302
How the fuck
you know what a fuckin'
Marc "Jenkins" dress is?

681
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:09,439
Watch one episode
of  <i> What Not to Wear</i>
and get back to me.

682
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,209
- Bitch is a cop.
- Man, she a trick.

683
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,877
- Cop.
- She's a trick.

684
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:16,480
No! That's the bitch
from the news.

685
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,682
What?
Why you let Pookie
up in here?

686
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,418
Why you let
some cop up in here?
Look, she ain't no cop.

687
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,120
That's the bitch
from the news.

688
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,122
Channel Six  <i> Live at 5:00.</i>

689
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,124
I'm about to put my foot up
in your motherfucking mouth.

690
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,893
I-I'm not a cop.
I'm not.

691
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,728
I am--
I'm bitch from the news.

692
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,432
"For KZLA  <i> Live at 5:00</i>
<i>Eyewitness News,</i>

693
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:36,867
I'm Meghan Miles.

694
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,435
Be well."

695
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,403
Pookie,
shut the hell up.

696
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:43,173
Why the hell would
KZLA's Meghan Miles...

697
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:46,176
be sucking dick
for crack in our hood?

698
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:48,545
No, I'm not
sucking dick for crack.

699
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,447
What you sucking dick
for then?

700
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,215
Nothing.

701
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,351
- Shit's free?
- Uh--

702
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:56,820
So, you ain't sucked
one dick tonight?

703
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,725
Yeah, that's what I thought.

704
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,827
Okay, but it's--
That's not, uh--

705
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,495
Look, I'm just lost.

706
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,297
And I just need
to make a phone call.

707
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,300
- I just wanted
to borrow your phone.
- Look, right here. Look.

708
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:13,336
- Oh, my God.
- Bitch from the news.

709
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,437
Yeah.
Look at this.

710
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,541
"Be well." I love it.

711
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:20,177
Oh, shit.
It do kind of look like you.

712
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,946
Yeah. I'm Meghan.
Meghan Miles.

713
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,681
Look, bitch from the news,

714
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,284
you real good and stuff,

715
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:30,954
but I just think
you need to work on inviting
the audience in a little more.

716
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:33,223
Earnin' they trust.

717
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,592
You have a natural,
approachable beauty.
I like it.

718
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:38,628
But your delivery
is just a little robotic.

719
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,666
I just feel like
you can show us
a little more warmth.

720
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:45,769
- I know it's in there.
- Pookie, what
you smoking on?

721
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,371
Weed laced
with embalming fluid.

722
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,940
It's pretty good.

723
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:51,908
No, no, no. I kind of see
what he's sayin'.

724
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,711
Uh-huh.
See, it's like you closed
to the world.

725
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,680
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

726
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:58,615
I mean, look how you holding
your shoulders right now.
Mm-hmm.

727
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,717
All closed off--

728
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,555
like you don't trust us.

729
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,992
Okay, these are, uh,
excellent points.

730
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:12,495
Viewer feedback
is very important
to me, Mr., uh--

731
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,297
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

732
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,498
- And?
- Scrilla.

733
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,567
Scrilla and Pookie.

734
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,836
- With two O's.
- Okay.

735
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,540
I'm gonna take
everything you said--

736
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,342
I'm going to take it all
under consideration.

737
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,410
I need to get back
to do the news.

738
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,346
Tonight, live at 5:00.

739
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:32,849
I'm up for a promotion,
so it's really important
that I be there.

740
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,551
But I am lost,

741
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,454
and I don't have a phone
or money,

742
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:39,289
and my car's
in the impound lot.

743
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:43,260
And I am currently
standing in the middle
of a ghetto crack house.

744
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,295
Sorry. No offense.

745
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,531
- None taken.
- That's a pretty fair
description.

746
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,700
Look, I'll tell you what.

747
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,269
I'm going to help you out.

748
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,938
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Give her that one.

749
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,340
Use that one.
Okay.

750
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,010
Thank you.
You got it.

751
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:01,611
- Thank you.
- Right over there.

752
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,580
Okay.

753
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,583
 Give me that.
What happened to that dress?

754
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,953
Since when you watch the news?
I wake up at 5:00.
That's what I--

755
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,888
You got a TV?

756
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,958
You see the TV in the back.
You need to sell that shit.
You owe me money.

757
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,860
I already paid you.


758
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,896
Remember my E.B.T. card?
[ Scrilla ]
Shut the hell up.

759
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,978
What's wrong, sweetheart?

760
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,581

00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:16,846
and everything goes to shit.

914
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,815
I know. It's crazy.

915
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:20,216
Add to that,
she jacks a cabdriver.

916
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,984
Now she's running
with Scrilla's gang.

917
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,920
No, no, no, no.
She's just a hooker.

918
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:25,288
We saw her at the Point.
Yeah.

919
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,256
- And you didn't bring her in?
- I wanted to.

920
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,260
Tell you what, Lieutenant,

921
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,995
How about we just brief
the next shift coming in--

922
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:35,865
Next shift?
Ain't no next shift for you.

923
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,867
You two can I.D. her.
You're staying on
till we bring her in.

924
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:40,169
Caucasian, yellow dress,
hooker.

925
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,238
Back to the streets, fellas.

926
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,974
Sorry.
What's wrong with you?
"I wanted to."

927
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:48,111
Protect and serve.
Go fuck yourself, Vic.

928
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,830
"It's Meghan. Help.
Lost in the Hood."

929
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:19,509
<i Who this?</i>
Oh, hey. This is--
I'm looking for Meghan.

930
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:22,211
<i>Bitch from the news?</i>
<i>She gone.</i>

931
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,380
<i>Don't call this number again,</i>
<i>motherfucker.</i>

932
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,876
Oh! Ooh.
Oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you there.

933
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:55,545
Ugh. Okay.
Hey! You're Meghan Miles,

934
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:57,146
that Channel Six news lady.

935
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,518
It's a long story.
You don't have five dollars,
do you?

936
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,122
- In the store, I do.
Can you wait right here?
- Sure.

937
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:08,891
For five dollars,
let me take your photo
and I'll put it on the wall.

938
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:10,893
Oh. No, no. I can't--

939
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:12,862
And then I put it
on Facebook
and everyone likes it.

940
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:15,464
No, no. Oh, no, no.
You can't put a photo
on Facebook.

941
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,201
No, no photos.
I'll send you a head shot.
I'll send you something.

942
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,539
Hey, look!
Meghan Miles
on the walk of shame.

943
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,331
Uh, Meghan's phone.

944
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,266
Who's this?
Where's Meghan?

945
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:55,438
Well, where is she now?
Why do you have her phone?
Did you hurt her?

946
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,308
No. No, I--
We went home together
last night,

947
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,044
and I'm thinking
she might be in some
trouble right now.

948
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,647
She left her phone here,
and I have no idea
where she is.

949
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:08,017
You better be telling
the truth, psycho,
because I will out-psycho you.

950
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,219
And if you hurt Meghan,
I will reign fucking fury down
on you.

951
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,022
<i>Relax.</i>

952
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:15,625
<i>Where do you live?</i>
244 Traction.

953
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:19,128
- Where the fuck is that?
- It's downtown
near the Sixth Street bridge.

954
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,197
People live there?
<i>Yeah. I do.</i>

955
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,599
Buzz 810 when you get here.

956
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:26,202
All right, well, you stay
there or I'm calling the cops.

957
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:30,907
-  
<i>Denise, get up.</i>
- I'm up.

958
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:33,309
- I can hear
your sound machine.
- I need to just lie here.

959
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,111
It's bad.
It's really bad.

960
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:37,914
Denise, just get up.
Meghan might be in trouble.
She needs us.

961
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,315
<i>You don't understand.</i>
<i>I--</i>

962
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:42,018
Hey, babe,
is everything cool?

963
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,920
Please don't touch me.

964
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,488
Who is that?

965
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,990
<i>I made a terrible mistake</i>
<i>last night.</i>

966
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:51,260
I think I may have
taken Iggy Pop home.

967
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,479
All right, all right.
What's up? What's up?

968
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,582
There you go.
Mm-hmm.

969
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:20,022
What the fuck is this?

970
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:21,991
Hi.
All right.

971
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:24,260
Hey, I don't wanna
waste anyone's time.

972
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:28,164
I'm gonna assume that
you're a crack dealer.

973
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,967
And, um, I was wondering
if you wanted
a little more.

974
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,735
A little more what?

975
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:34,437
A little more crack.

976
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:38,074
You know, like, maybe
I could cash it in
for some money.

977
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:40,409
You wanna sell me crack?

978
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:43,679
Well, I technically
don't wanna sell it because
I think that that's wrong.

979
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,282
But I was hoping
that maybe make a return
or something.

980
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,684
Oh. Okay. A return.
Yeah.

981
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,353
You got the receipt?

982
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,021
The--

983
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:54,590
Uh--
Or maybe the box
it came in?

984
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:57,126
Oh, come on, man,
I just have the crack.

985
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,095
Oh, you just got the crack?
Yeah, that's all I have.

986
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:01,497
And I just thought,
you know, you could
add it to your stash,

987
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,532
Uh-huh.
give me, like, 10 bucks,

988
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,534
and then you can
sell it for more,
and that's good business.

989
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,406
You don't walk
into McDonald's
with your own hamburgers...

990
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:12,508
and try
to sell it to 'em.

991
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,011
You know why?
Because they already got
their own hamburgers.

992
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:18,314
They're not gonna look
at your hamburgers
and be like, "Oh, shit.

993
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:20,683
She's got hamburgers.
That looks like a good deal.

994
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,352
Maybe I could buy 'em,
turn around and sell 'em
for twice as much."

995
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,322
Crack is
all the same, right?
It's just this little thing.

996
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,357
Put that shit away.
What the fuck you doing,
trying to set me up?

997
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,395
I'm saying that it
would be very easy to
pass off as your own crack.

998
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:33,662
It's probably all
from the same place,
isn't it?

999
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:38,234
I technically got it
from Pookie who, I'm sure,
got it from Scrilla.

1000
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:40,169
Scrilla?
Yeah, yeah.
It's his crack.

1001
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:43,172
You wanna unload
Scrilla's shit on my corner,
pass it off as my own?

1002
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:45,775
You got a death wish, lady?
Yo, Ladeke! [ Whistles ]
What?

1003
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:48,210
Who's Ladeke?
Deal with this shit.
School this bitch right now.

1004
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,311
You're in the wrong territory.
This is the Figueroa Crew,
man.

1005
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,047
I'm going.

1006
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:53,182
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'm not done with you.

1007
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:58,554
- I'm getting on the bus.
- Come back here, man.
You wanna disrespect me?

1008
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,156
Yo, Ladeke,
what am I, a sparrow?

1009
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:02,658
When I whistle,
you got to respond!

1010
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,462
You can't be behind the line.

1011
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:08,664
This one?
There's two sides.

1012
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:10,733
Is this the side?
You on the wrong side.

1013
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,468
Okay, okay, great.

1014
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,437
$1.50.

1015
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,207
You, blondie.

1016
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:20,776
Uh, yes. Yes.

1017
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,545
$1.50.

1018
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:25,648
Such a good
round... number.

1019
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,616
- Where's your money?
- Oh, it's, uh--

1020
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,518
You know what?
You can just keep going.

1021
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,787
It's, um--
It's here somewhere.

1022
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,456
It's, um--

1023
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,459
Shame.

1024
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:38,427
Are-- Are you
talking to me?

1025
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,596
Have you no shame?

1026
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,765
I don't know
who you think you are,
Judgey Judgey Judgeyson,

1027
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,835
but I am-- You know, don't--
I'm just trying to get
to work.

1028
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:48,637
Why don't you get
your pimp to drive you?

1029
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,207
These people
are good people.

1030
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:54,710
Oh, I'm sorry.
I missed the sign
"good people only."

1031
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:57,413
How do you know
what is in my soul?
Hey!

1032
00:51:57,415 --> 00:51:59,782
Oh, I can tell.
I can tell.
$1.50.

1033
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:03,419
Okay. Does the $1.50
need to be paid
at every stop...

1034
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,454
or does it cover
the entire journey?

1035
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,691
Are you for serious?

1036
00:52:08,693 --> 00:52:10,593
I am for serious.

1037
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:13,662
Do you take credit cards?
Yeah. You can swipe it
right there.

1038
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:18,400
Really? That is amazing,
innovative technology--

1039
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,402
that you can just--

1040
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:22,538
Do you take
debit cards?

1041
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,673
Do you have a debit card?

1042
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,143
I do not.

1043
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:28,911
Listen. I'm gonna give you
some advice.

1044
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:30,746
Sure.

1045
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:32,481
You might wanna think
about another line of work,

1046
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,150
'cause you ain't
no good at this.

1047
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:35,751
If you ain't even got $1.50,

1048
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:39,722
you probably should
think about retiring
as a whore.

1049
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:44,660
And if you do scrape up $1.50,
use it to buy yourself
a sandwich.

1050
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,229
That's the reason
you can't turn no tricks--

1051
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,831
'cause you ain't got
no meat on your bones.

1052
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,200
Now, that advice
was free,

1053
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:53,435
but this ride is $1.50.

1054
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:56,605
So you can pay that
or you can get your ass
off my bus.

1055
00:52:56,607 --> 00:53:01,177
Okay. I just need to get as
far away from this gang
territory as possible.

1056
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,811
Really?

1057
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:05,447
If you want, I can sit down
and tell you the whole story.

1058

Yes. Several times.

1082

All right, if you
were Meghan Miles,
where would you be?

1083
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,806

sent here to test my faith.

Oh.

1095
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:37,032
Stimulation is
a distraction from,
and an offense to, God.

1096
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,703
And with
an uncovered head.

1097
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:43,505
And this dress.

1098
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,508

Okay, can you please just--
Please, just go.

in this day and age,

1101
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,816
you're not going to let me use
the bathroom or make a call...

Yeah, I just need--
I need $1.50.

1104
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,358
No, no. Look,
there are no women
allowed in there, okay?

1105
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,526
Women are kept separate
from the men.

1106
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:08,130
In fact, our men
aren't even allowed
to hear a woman sing.

1107
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:11,033
It's just bus fare.

1108
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:14,603
That's really all I need.
No one will know.

1109
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:16,772
There's no one here.
It's just us.

1110

Okay. Look, of all
the prohibitions,

1111
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:27,116
I love the female voice
mixing in the wind.

1112
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,485
The lilt.
The sweetness.

1113
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:31,019
Hmm.

my ears touch?

1116

would eagerly be paid
for such a delight.

<i>And I don't care</i>
<i>what people think anymore,</i>

1642
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:21,181
<i>because it is exhausting.</i>

1643
01:25:21,183 --> 01:25:25,786
So let's just let the shame
lie with everyone...

1644
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:29,189
<i>who took one look</i>
<i>at a girl in a-- in a--</i>

1645
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:34,294
<i>in this-- I mean, this is not,</i>
<i>I agree, the most</i>
<i>conservative outfit,</i>

1646
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:38,565
<i>but this should not</i>
<i>automatically make me</i>
<i>a pariah or prey.</i>

1647
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:40,567
Meghan,
Have you lost your mind?

1648
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,703
<i>The point is that</i>
<i>everything I did,</i>

1649
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:45,839
<i>I did because I was trying</i>
<i>to get back here...</i>

1650
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:50,444
<i>so that I could convince</i>
<i>a few people...</i>

1651
01:25:50,446 --> 01:25:53,347
<i>that I am someone</i>
<i>that I no longer am.</i>

1652
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,818
<i>I am not safe or perfect.</i>

1653
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,488
<i>And if I'm going</i>
<i>to tell you the news,</i>

1654
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,891
<i>I should be telling</i>
<i>the real story...</i>

1655
01:26:03,893 --> 01:26:06,860
<i>and not just reading</i>
<i>this dumb script.</i>

1656
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:09,196
<i>Dan, I'm sorry.</i>

1657
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:11,832
<i>You're the best.</i>
<i>You've been nothing</i>
<i>but the best to me.</i>

1658
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,734
<i>And you're gonna</i>
<i>haul me out of here.</i>
<i>So real quick.</i>

1659
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:17,437
<i>I just need to say that Kyle,</i>
<i>I never want to see you again.</i>

1660
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:22,509
I'm so glad I dumped her.
<i>Don't call me.</i>
<i>I won't call you.</i>

1661
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:26,313
We traced your number
from a recovered cell phone
used by a drug syndicate.

1662
01:26:26,315 --> 01:26:29,616
<i>Rose and Denise,</i>
<i>thank you more...</i>

1663
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:31,718
<i>for being my friends</i>
<i>and coming to get me.</i>

1664
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,189
We did good.
We crushed it.

1665
01:26:35,191 --> 01:26:37,891
Hey, is it too early
for shots?
[ Man ] Hell to the no.

1666
01:26:37,893 --> 01:26:40,627
What are you
still doing here?

1667
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:43,764
<i>And, um--</i>
<i>New guy, Gordon. Hey.</i>

1668
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:48,869
So, I'm
a little bit crazy.
[ Chuckles ]

1669
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:50,771
Also, you looked
really good in this dress.
I just remembered that part.

1670
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:52,372
And one last thing.

1671
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,907
<i>A big shout out to my boys--</i>

1672
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:55,943
<i>Scrilla, Hulk</i>
<i>and especially Pookie.</i>

1673
01:26:55,945 --> 01:26:57,611
Aw!
Aw!

1674
01:26:57,613 --> 01:26:59,813
What I'd tell ya?
What?

1675
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:04,918
<i>And his uncle in chinos.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I don't remember</i>
<i>the rest, Pooks.</i>

1676
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,254
What?
That's my bitch
from the news.

1677
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:09,356
<i>That's the news.</i>
<i>I'm Meghan Miles.</i>

1678
01:27:09,358 --> 01:27:10,924
<i>Be well or,</i>
<i>you know, whatever.</i>

1679
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:13,393
<i>Just--</i>

1680
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,862
<i>Just be yourself.</i>
<i>I mean, just--</i>

1681
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:17,698
Okay. Thanks, Dan.

1682
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,866
- Good luck, Chuck.
 Chuck,
move to Meghan's chair.

1683
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:21,501
I think we should
get out of here.

1684
01:27:21,503 --> 01:27:22,836
Maybe we should go.
Yeah, I think we should.

1685
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:25,305
<i>Meghan Miles,</i>
<i>you will be missed.</i>

1686
01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:27,608
<i>Good day, Los Angeles.</i>
<i>I'm Chuck Rogers.</i>

1687
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:29,676
You know what happened.
I'm not crazy.

1688
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:31,712
 Meghan.
No, what was crazy
about that?

1689
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:36,383
Incredible.
Yeah,
I'm really sorry.

1690
01:27:36,385 --> 01:27:38,552
You should hire Chang.

1691
01:27:38,554 --> 01:27:41,288
I mean, what an incredible
idea for an investigative
series.

1692
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:44,324
The girl
in the yellow dress.

1693
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:47,361
Right. But you know
I didn't plan that.
It was just what happened.

1694
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:49,496
Even better. Like
<i>To Catch A Predator </i> meets--

1695
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:53,500
Tyra Banks in a fat suit
meets  <i> Undercover Millionaire.</i>
It's fresh.

1696
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:57,771
Meghan, I know there's
something we can do together
at the network.

1697
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:01,541
- What are we talking about?
- It's a reality show.

1698
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:03,577
I love it.
Love it.

1699
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:07,648
- Reality?
Your call.

1700
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:11,051
I need to think about it
and get back to you.

1701
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:12,753
Dan here can get
the ball rolling.

1702
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:14,721
I just need
a pair of shoes.

1703
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:17,591
Maybe a sandwich.
Get you some shoes.
Oh, some food too.

1704
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,026
Maybe brush my teeth.
Right?

1705
01:28:19,028 --> 01:28:20,727
No, no, you're fine.

1706
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:23,397
Just do some hair fixing.
I got your back,
Meghan.

1707
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:25,699
So, what do you have
in mind for us?

1708
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:28,902
- You two are a package?
- Yeah, I'm her producer.

1709
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:30,537
How much to go away?

1710
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:32,673
Hey, babe.
There he is.
Arrest him.

1711
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:34,308
Sir, we need you to stand up,
put your hands behind your back.

1712
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:35,976
What are you talking about?

1713
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,377
Put your cookies down.
Let's go.

1714
01:28:37,379 --> 01:28:38,378
What are you doing,
arresting me?

1715
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,314
For what?
Being too sexy? Ow!

1716
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:46,053
So, your place or mine?
Yeah. Um--

1717
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,823
I'd love to show you mine.

1718
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,892
It's very empty,
but it has a bed.

1719
01:28:51,894 --> 01:28:53,727
Nice. How are we
going to get there?

1720
01:28:53,729 --> 01:28:55,429
Ooh, I have not
thought of that.

1721
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:57,631
Uh, maybe we should
take that cab.
No. No, no.

1722
01:28:57,633 --> 01:28:59,066
No time for that.
No, it's not.

1723
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:00,801
I never wanna see
a cab again.
Okay.

1724
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,542
We're gonna walk.
That's fine with me.

1725
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:10,544
This will be more
of an adventure.
