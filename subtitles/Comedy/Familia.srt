1
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:23,322
Fifty thousand billion cells
make up the human body.

2
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:33,199
Each of these cells contains the entire
genetic heritage of our parents.

3
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:47,340
DNA is the universal
code for living.

4
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:59,989
In a way, our genetic code
is the memory of humanity,

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,654
the record of evolution.

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,847
But what exactly
does this code transmit?

7
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,853
The color of our eyes?

8
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,549
The size of our feet?

9
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,523
Our intelligence?

10
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,355
But what else?

11
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,498
What about a person's
temperament?

12
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,832
What about impatience...

13
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,872
aggressiveness...

14
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,703
courage?

15
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,808
Are we the helpless prisoners
of our genetic code...

16
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,543
or are we free to forge
our own identity?

17
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,416
Michèle!

18
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,699
- You promised.
- It's not my fault. Nicole insisted.

19
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,535
When you hit a winning streak,
you go with it...

20
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,699
No more credit cards.

21
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,175
- I know.
- No more advances on your pay.

22
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,041
I'm docking your salary.

23
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,173
Mimi, it's because I love you.

24
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,275
Love me? Oh yeah?

25
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,718
That's a good one!

26
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,256
How about I love you,

27
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,588
so I rat on you
for selling steroids?

28
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,422
- Is that a good deal?
- Get in.

29
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,831
- You're a fucking madman!
- Mimi, are you okay?

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,427
- Don't touch me!
- I didn't mean to.

31
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,336
- Let me see.
- I'm bleeding, shit!

32
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,136
- Let me take a look.
- Shit, I'm cut.

33
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,612
No, you're not cut.
You're just bleeding a little.

34
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,390
Hello?

35
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,727
You okay?

36
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,796
Yeah, sure.

37
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,888
I thought you were in bed.

38
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,761
Where were you?

39
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,198
I slept over at Sara's.

40
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,532
Without asking me?

41
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,333
You weren't home.

42
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,198
Fuck, these are mine!
What's going on?

43
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:15,475
I'm sorry for snooping, honey,
but we're in a hurry.

44
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,383
In a hurry? Why?

45
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,749
"I promise I'll pay it all
back some day.

46
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,053
Forgive me, Big Boy.

47
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,218
Thanks for everything.
Love, Mimi."

48
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,825
I'm not leaving.

49
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,696
Margot, this isn't
the time for games.

50
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,462
What's the rush?

51
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,028
Let's say, Scott won't
be happy if he finds us.

52
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,405
You, maybe.
I didn't do anything.

53
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,744
What about a visit
to your godmother?

54
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,652
In California?

55
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,383
What happened to you?

56
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,949
Okay, move it.
We're leaving.

57
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,654
I'm not going.

58
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,195
Shit!

59
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,129
Where are they?

60
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,099
This sucks.
I liked it here.

61
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,978
Hello? Mom?

62
00:06:55,047 --> 00:07:00,246
Sweet Jesus,
this is a surprise!

63
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,084
Hi there!

64
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,750
Margot, my love!

65
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,089
How are you?

66
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,924
You're almost as sexy
as your grandma!

67
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,022
- Where are you going?
- We're coming back.

68
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,432
When you get tired of your mom,

69
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,407
get yourself a one-way
ticket for Ibiza.

70
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,843
It's paradise for young people
like you and me.

71
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,813
Are we just going
to stand here?

72
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,452
- What happened?
- A Tae Kwon Do accident.

73
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,352
It's your turn, Mom.

74
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,980
Wow.

75
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,718
Good move.

76
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,784
Well, the school's important.

77
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,454
But so is the teacher.

78
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,021
- You can get a bad one.
- You don't say.

79
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:53,634
But our real education
takes place at home.

80
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,675
That's where knowledge
and values are passed on.

81
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:01,179
Family is the foundation
of who we are.

82
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,613
What are you talking about?

83
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,585
I don't want Margot to end up
with a dumb job, like you.

84
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,019
Like "yours".

85
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,217
- You should have got a degree.
- With what money?

86
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,853
Besides, I teach,
like François.

87
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,160
Really, you teach aerobics!

88
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,999
Right, as a registrar,
you can date classy profs.

89
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,130
My job is a lot more complex
than you think.

90
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,436
She's my daughter,
and she likes her school.

91
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,945
Can you please
change the subject?

92
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,642
I win!

93
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,744
Hold it, something's fishy.

94
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,153
What?

95
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,214
Mom, you cheated!

96
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,090
You switched cards!

97
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,628
Come on!

98
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,062
- Madeleine!
- I didn't!

99
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,033
Mom?

100
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,799
Mom?

101
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,272
Could you lend me some money?

102
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,645
$750. You'll get it
off my next pay.

103
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,951
Did you screw up again?

104
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,218
I can't, Michèle.
We just got back and...

105
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,851
It's okay.
No need to apologize.

106
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,061
Have you talked
to Chloé recently?

107
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,958
We could go visit her together.

108
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,970
Here, wait a second.

109
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,400
It's better than nothing.

110
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,466
A centavo saved
is a dollar earned.

111
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,806
Wait till you see
what I brought you.

112
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,375
It's so cute!

113
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,580
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, really!

114
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,453
I love the colors!

115
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,016
Thank you!

116
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,925
What is it?

117
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,897
It has ice packs on each side.

118
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,163
Only you come up
with gifts like this.

119
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,635
- Great!
- A new fashion trend?

120
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,138
Yes!

121
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,200
I didn't know...
it's not what you think.

122
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,033
- We have a doorbell!
- So I see.

123
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,971
I know, I...

124
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,804
I should have rung.

125
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,673
It's just...

126
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,771
it's your drapes.
I love your drapes.

127
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,080
Forgive me.
Really, I owe you an apology.

128
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,916
My name is Béatrice Lacombe.
I'm an interior decorator.

129
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:00,516
I was driving by and noticed
your gorgeous drapes.

130
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,754
- Really?
- Yes, the color...

131
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,729
it's exactly what
my client is looking for.

132
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,570
Those were the good old days,

133
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,232
before those darn computers.

134
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,276
Nowadays everything
is virtual, digital.

135
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,470
Networked.

136
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,949
My husband's
a "programmator"...

137
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,179
a programmer.
A computer scientist.

138
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,187
You're married?

139
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:33,248
No, but I like to say "my husband."
It sounds more official.

140
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,330
Thanks!
It shouldn't take long.

141
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,199
If they like them, I'll have the same made
and I'll bring them back.

142
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,463
It's so nice of you.
You barely know me.

143
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,201
My pleasure.

144
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,504
I hear you need money.

145
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,877
You fucking perv!

146
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,750
I just want to help.

147
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,879
- What do think I am?
- Wait.

148
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,283
Okay, that's enough.

149
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,758
What's eating you,
for Heaven's sake?

150
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,853
If it's because I cheated
at rummy, okay.

151
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,865
Mea culpa.

152
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,391
- But you'd have done the same.
- It's for the best, Mom.

153
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,734
At least stay one night.

154
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,446
I don't know
what you're after, Mimi,

155
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,577
but one day there'll be
no one left to help you.

156
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,486
Fancy words. Bye.

157
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,365
- Michèle?
- Janine!

158
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,304
Hello!
Why, come in!

159
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,967
I'm so happy to see you!

160
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,580
My beautiful Marguerite,
you've changed so much!

161
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,378
It's been, what, a year!

162
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,943
You sure don't look a day older!

163
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,355
Come in!

164
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,692
I'm so embarrassed.
The house is a pigsty!

165
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,027
You should have warned me!

166
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,624
Wonderful surprise, huh?

167
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,499
But what brings you...

168
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,834
it's great! Fantastic!

169
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,307
What does the place
look like when it's tidy?

170
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,641
You still listen to J-Lo?

171
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,273
You gave it to me.

172
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,580
Yeah, like 10 years ago!

173
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,382
Don't you have any electro,

174
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,946
or jungle, or anything?

175
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,897
Will you be staying here long?

176
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,933
No way, man!

177
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,367
We're going to California.

178
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,044
It's an iPod.

179
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,018
What's that?

180
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,613
What are you doing there,
my baby?

181
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,420
How did you get there?

182
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,018
What is that, a rat?

183
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,859
No, it's Rosalie.

184
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,559
Hello!

185
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,568
- Mom sent me.
- Get lost.

186
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:45,034
You wouldn't believe
the threats he made.

187
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,046
He completely flipped.
He wanted to keep my pay.

188
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,912
Like that, for no reason?

189
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,817
He's a control freak.

190
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,414
He's jealous, selfish,
super possessive.

191
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,893
It couldn't go on.
The guy needs therapy.

192
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,931
Goodness, what a story!

193
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:11,334
I've heard about men who are
on steroids and go berserk,

194
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,961
but I never thought
I'd know one.

195
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,029
Steroids...

196
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,565
they bulk up your biceps
and shrink your brain.

197
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,883
Tell me the truth.

198
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:31,946
Was it the first time
Scott hit you?

199
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,361
Janine, I don't want to impose.

200
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,128
Please, don't worry.

201
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,302
Could we sleep here tonight?

202
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,110
Of course. I insist on it.

203
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,077
Could I make
a long-distance call?

204
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,487
Sure.

205
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,355
Michèle, you still owe me money.

206
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,952
I'm not a bank.

207
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,692
How long does it take
to drive to California?

208
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,167
- What are you hatching now?
- What does it cost?

209
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,295
With gas, motels, everything?

210
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,135
It's pretty expensive.
Why?

211
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,300
I really miss you, Chloé.

212
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,310
So does Margot.

213
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,175
You're her godmother, after all.

214
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,913
I wanted to surprise you,
but so what?

215
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,820
Margot and I are
moving to California.

216
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,591
Cool, huh?

217
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,092
Michèle,

218
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,657
I don't know what shit you're in,

219
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,704
but you're not going
to live off me, okay?

220
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,762
That's why I left home.

221
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,810
I also need a break, you know?

222
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,737
Listen, just lend me
enough cash for the trip...

223
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,479
not much:
$500 or $600 US.

224
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,613
I have what, 10 years'
experience as a waitress.

225
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:15,217
You find me a job and
keep my first two weeks' pay.

226
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,854
Now's not a good time, Michèle.

227
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,228
I'm busy.
We'll talk later.

228
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,029
- Bye.
- Wait!

229
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,333
- Margot said to say hi.
- Give her a kiss for me.

230
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,669
Sorry for interrupting you.

231
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,106
Don't forget about my job.

232
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,853
I have to get going.

233
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,358
But stay here today.

234
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,419
- No, I don't want to...
- No, I insist.

235
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,159
- Enjoy the pool.
- Are you sure?

236
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,030
That's so great!

237
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,194
Bye.

238
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,138
Gabrielle?
Alexandre?

239
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,905
Janine?

240
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,916
I feel really
awkward asking, but...

241
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,145
I'm, like, completely broke.

242
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,653
I need my prescription.
I got a big rash.

243
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,213
- It's stress.
- Sure, I understand.

244
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,962
- Thank you!
- Is that enough?

245
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,759
I feel so cheap.
I promise to pay you back.

246
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,627
Can I stay with them today?

247
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,533
Sure, why not?

248
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,106
- Camp's boring!
- You're so spoiled!

249
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,769
Lots of kids would love to go.

250
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:42,973
Take care!

251
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,028
- Hello.
- Hi.

252
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,032
- Sorry, I spread out...
- No problem.

253
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,828
Just wait, I made my sauce.

254
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,028
- Like some wine?
- Sure.

255
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,953
It was one night, then another.

256
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,454
Now she's looking for a job.

257
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,854
I don't want her settling in here.

258
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,985
I've enough
with the house and kids.

259
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,927
- And you're always away.
- It makes for company.

260
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,939
Well, then tell them
to leave, sweetie.

261
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,805
You should see her face.
Scott beat her up.

262
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,400
I can't.

263
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,440
Put her on, I'll tell her.

264
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,746
Where are you staying?

265
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,252
The Plaza Inn... or Resort
or something.

266
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,585
- Is the weather nice?
- So-so.

267
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,716
I work indoors all day anyway.

268
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,317
Poor darling.

269
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,399
- Is someone with you?
- No.

270
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,669
Well, in fact, there is:

271
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,268
A charming news anchorwoman.

272
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,870
Is she pretty?

273
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,647
Did you hear?
Russia's invaded Chechnya.

274
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,817
- It's awful.
- Yeah, it's awful.

275
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,862
Darling, I...

276
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,193
I feel like making love.

277
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,202
Right now.

278
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,295
Over the phone?

279
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,533
Undress me.
Say something sweet.

280
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,340
Sure.

281
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,614
I long for your body,

282
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,655
for your bum,

283
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,590
for your thighs,

284
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,059
for your tongue.

285
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,188
Caress yourself.

286
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,491
My love, tell me
what turns you on.

287
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,764
You.

288
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,602
You, now.

289
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,539
All of you.

290
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,009
I love it when...

291
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,452
when your tongue
glides over my thighs,

292
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,546
over my sex.

293
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,661
My mouth is burning,
it wants to kiss you!

294
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,095
Honey, I'm sorry.

295
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,599
I'm going to be late.

296
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,967
We'll continue on Saturday.

297
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,528
Okay? I promise.

298
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,905
See you on Saturday.

299
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,467
I kiss you all over.

300
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,013
And kiss the kids for me.

301
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,049
Okay. Bye.

302
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,666
Five, six, seven, eight!

303
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,405
Five, six... again!

304
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,209
Take your time.

305
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,411
Come on, it'll be
good for you, Janine.

306
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,511
I don't know...

307
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,751
Just the side kick, all right?

308
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,988
You'll see, it's
a great stress-reliever.

309
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,462
Lower your arms, that's it.
Elbows up, make a fist.

310
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,991
Now kick with your foot,
like you're closing a car door.

311
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,168
Go on, kick.

312
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,730
That's it.
Again, kick!

313
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,639
That's great. Super!

314
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,146
Good!
Yeah, keep it up!

315
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,944
Good, slam the car door.

316
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,541
Slam the door!
Slam the door...

317
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,921
- This feels great.
- You bet.

318
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,925
Slam it!

319
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,325
- That's okay.
- Go for it!

320
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,622
This "bungle" is way cool.

321
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,902
It's "jungle"!

322
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,602
Wanna go to the mall?

323
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,604
- It's a 20-minute walk.
- Cool!

324
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,339
What's wrong?

325
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,351
I'm not allowed to go
that far alone.

326
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,354
You gotta be kidding.

327
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,990
You're not alone,
you're with me.

328
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,396
Want to chat online?

329
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,333
Girl, Montreal, 16.

330
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,871
Well, almost.
In three years.

331
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,374
REALLY WANNA FUCK.
YOU?

332
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,246
FUCK WHICH WAY?

333
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,447
S & M.
YOU MASTER.

334
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,684
ALREADY HARD.
CUFFS?

335
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,852
I SCRATCH YOUR SKIN WITH RAZOR,
LICK THE BLOOD.

336
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,793
I SUCK YOUR COCK
TILL YOU EXPLODE.

337
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,990
I PISS ON YOUR FACE.

338
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,237
Hi.

339
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,102
Hi.

340
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,981
I'm in deep shit.

341
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,918
It's bad timing, looking
for a job in the summer,

342
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,080
with vacations and all.

343
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:38,184
I don't know how to say this.

344
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,061
Could you lend me
some more money?

345
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,926
Look, I take it back.

346
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,064
Forget what I said, Janine.

347
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,037
We're imposing, huh?

348
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:01,981
I'm not perfect, but at least
I know when I'm not wanted.

349
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,749
We didn't want to bother you.
I'm sorry.

350
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:08,054
- We'll clear out.
- Wait.

351
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,653
No, don't worry.
I understand.

352
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,423
What if I offered you a job?

353
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,099
Nothing complicated.

354
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,898
You'd help me out,
run errands, make phone calls.

355
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,337
You'd earn a bit of money.

356
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,278
Janine, I'll make it up
to you 100 times over!

357
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,440
Okay, put on your best clothes,
we'll start now.

358
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,577
This is pretty much
my winning outfit.

359
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,052
Okay.

360
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:16,856
A Provençal green,
very luminous,

361
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:22,867
to highlight this painting,
which is quite magnificent.

362
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,425
Yes, I think that would work.

363
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,563
For the drapes,
we have lots of options.

364
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,972
I brought you some samples.

365
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,637
I don't know, I imagine
something cheer,

366
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,578
floor-length.

367
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,548
It would be way glamorous!

368
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,583
It's just an idea.

369
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,812
What color do you suggest?

370
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,382
I don't know, maybe
some kind of orange,

371
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:53,397
nothing too harsh.

372
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:57,401
Kind of like this,
a yellowish-orange,

373
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,403
but not too intense.

374
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,241
Hello!
Hi, how are you?

375
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,817
- I brought wine.
- Great, put it inside.

376
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:31,901
- Still the beauty!
- Still the player!

377
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,699
No, is this Marguerite?

378
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,899
My little Margot,
you're all grown up!

379
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,707
My big Margot.
My Queen Margot!

380
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,715
Hi, Dad.

381
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,911
"Queen Margot"
has a nice ring to it.

382
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,285
I'm so happy to see you.
We should do it more often.

383
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,756
- Come and visit us some time.
- Get real!

384
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,520
Why not? I mean it!

385
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,525
Margot, my queen?
What did I say?

386
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,032
What's my phone number, Dad?

387
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,661
Your phone...

388
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,967
Hi, Gabrielle, little ladybug.

389
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,132
Anthony... Marguerite.

390
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,403
We've already met
at the club.

391
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,377
Were you there too?

392
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,175
Sorry, that night's
a total blank.

393
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,217
Man, I woke up
in the bathroom at 6:00 am.

394
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:24,016
- Were you on chemicals?
- No, I don't touch that.

395
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,556
I had a few drinks, but...

396
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,185
- do you go to Montreal often?
- With my new car, you bet.

397
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,785
A car, wow!

398
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,922
My darling little sister.

399
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,559
You're sweet to take in
Michèle and Marguerite.

400
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,126
Unlike you.

401
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,109
- A quick game of cards?
- Great idea.

402
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:51,007
- Is she still a casino regular?
- What do you mean?

403
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,108
- Lucien!
- What?

404
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,847
I'm no fool.
I know you still gamble.

405
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,316
That's Estelle, my dad's mom.

406
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,328
Our grandma.

407
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,958
A tightass...
black tea and dry biscuits.

408
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,832
- How about him?
- Her husband, Lucien.

409
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,431
- A real cool guy.
- We like him.

410
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,668
The blonde beside him is my mom.

411
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,270
- Miss Energy.
- She's a one-woman powerplant.

412
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,974
I wish my mom
were as cool as her.

413
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,641
Yeah, real cool.

414
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:03,710
Here's my Aunt Janine...
"No dirty shoes on my lawn."

415
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,385
Her nickname's Hitler.
My mom.

416
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,123
- My dad's sister.
- Your dad's?

417
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,190
- My dad's.
- His dad is my dad.

418
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,463
You have a sister?

419
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,597
A step-sister.
But I've never lived with my dad.

420
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,610
Dad slept with her mom
while he was with my mom.

421
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,804
Laurence.

422
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,542
No, Laurence is
our step-brother Nicolas' mom.

423
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,449
My mom lives in France.

424
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,084
Hi, everybody!

425
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,391
Hello, my darling.

426
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,763
- When the cat's away...
- Yes, it's a bit improvised.

427
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,499
You, improvise?

428
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:01,571
It took a game of cards
to get the family together.

429
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,080
- A drink for my Chuck?
- Certainly!

430
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,116
Me too!

431
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,183
You're the Punch Queen, Mimi!

432
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,880
- How you doing, Michèle?
- Good.

433
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,719
- You're at home here.
- Thanks.

434
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,988
Hey, we're starting
to think you live abroad.

435
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,894
It must be some kind of scheme
to save on taxes!

436
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,400
You were always the smartest one!

437
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:27,529
I'm sure that if Charles could,
he'd work nearby.

438
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:32,009
I should declare myself a single mom
to get a family allowance.

439
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,307
You can't anymore.
You have a girlfriend.

440
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:39,850
I have to admit, Michèle's
as messy as any man.

441
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,186
- Shall we play?
- Yeah, come on!

442
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,089
Mom will never let me.

443
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,253
It's simple, you look her
in the eye and say,

444
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,196
"Don't worry,
I won't be home late."

445
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,727
She'll never let me.

446
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,670
The trick is,
you can't look away,

447
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,469
not for a second.

448
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,102
What about your clothes?

449
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:15,575
- Are you sure?
- They look better on you than on me.

450
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,286
- She'll never let me.
- Don't forget.

451
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,087
You look her straight
in the eye and say...

452
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,253
"Don't worry, Mommy,
I won't be late."

453
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,353
Mom, not Mommy.
Mom!

454
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,764
- What?
- Forget it. Just go with it.

455
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:41,440
It's just that Olivier
invited us to a friend's house.

456
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,810
That's nice of Olivier.

457
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,577
Can we go?
We won't be home late.

458
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,711
Why not invite them here?

459
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,277
It's not the same.

460
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,323
If it's close by,
I'm okay with it.

461
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,222
Super!

462
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,022
- Go change your clothes.
- Don't worry, I won't be late.

463
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,225
You look vulgar.

464
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,434
Hi.

465
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,164
Shall we go?

466
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,763
Boys, take care of the girls now.

467
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,743
- And no drinking!
- Can I come to the party too?

468
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:17,212
Wear the dress I got you
for your birthday.

469
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,648
You know, the cute white dress.

470
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,712
After three times,
you French-kiss.

471
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,915
Come on, she's my sister!

472
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,221
Yeah, who made that rule?

473
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,593
French kiss!
French kiss!

474
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,712
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

475
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,449
It makes the beer work faster.

476
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,688
- Have a swig.
- I'm not thirsty.

477
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,587
Want to play Trust?

478
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,962
Turn around.

479
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,728
Go!

480
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,873
My purse!

481
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,207
Thanks!

482
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,010
Don't mention it!

483
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,641
It's so late.

484
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,278
Who cares?

485
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,652
Shit, the light's on.

486
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,841
One phone call!

487
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,776
Just one call!

488
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:06,112
"Hi, I know it's late, but don't worry,
we're coming home."

489
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,708
It's 4:00 am!

490
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,846
We looked everywhere for you.

491
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,390
What were you thinking?

492
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,552
Do you know
what I was thinking?

493
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,892
Attacked, kidnapped,

494
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,159
raped, hit by a car...

495
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,633
a mother's worst nightmares!

496
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,168
You have nothing to say?
You don't care!

497
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,916
What's this?

498
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,508
You're hurting me.

499
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,424
I will not let my daughter
turn into a tramp!

500
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,756
Is that clear?

501
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,224
I'm sorry, Mom.

502
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,886
That's great!
You're an expert now.

503
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,149
Thanks to you!

504
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,722
Turn! Turn!

505
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,790
You're good!
Okay, give it some gas!

506
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,892
This way, Grandpa?

507
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,767
Hit the breaks! Stop!

508
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,404
Margot, you all right?

509
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,110
Get ready now!

510
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,053
Here it comes!

511
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,956
Now kick!

512
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,017
Straight ahead!
To the side!

513
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:44,333
Look how pretty this is.

514
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,103
Don't you like it?

515
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,312
Michèle would love this.

516
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,815
Michèle...

517
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:56,410
Why doesn't she
stay at her mom's?

518
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,081
It would be more normal.

519
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:05,687
You can't just
show up uninvited

520
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,027
and just take over
someone else's place like that.

521
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,566
How vulgar.

522
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,228
- Michèle's become very vulgar.
- Mom!

523
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,431
Why do you accept it?

524
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,441
What difference
does it make to you?

525
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,501
How would it look
if I didn't help her?

526
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,444
We grew up together.

527
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,847
And Marguerite is
your granddaughter. Remember it.

528
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,113
Poor Francis.

529
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,990
Having her wasn't his idea.

530
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,361
Stop protecting him,
your little angel.

531
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,423
He was asking for it.

532
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,935
After all,
he is responsible

533
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,403
for his actions.

534
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,872
Can't a mom and
daughter even talk?

535
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,043
Why don't we check the antiques?

536
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,841
Maybe we'll find your bench.

537
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,941
Good bye. Thanks.

538
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,874
- I got everything!
- I made you run all over.

539
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,946
A present.
Thanks for the job.

540
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,617
- No, you shouldn't have.
- I insist.

541
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,216
Really.

542
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,057
It's my pleasure.

543
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,790
Open it!

544
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,206
- Wow, it's lovely.
- Not bad, huh?

545
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,738
Gab thinks maybe I have mono.

546
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,802
You have been looking pale.

547
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,077
But if you had mono,
you'd be flat on your back.

548
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,879
It must be hormones.

549
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:11,183
It's normal at your age.
It'll pass.

550
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,485
I had a feeling you'd like it.

551
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:16,583
- It has some...
- It's very sweet. Thank you.

552
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,185
But please, no more gifts.

553
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,993
You need to save
so you can leave.

554
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,125
For California.

555
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,192
We're in no rush.

556
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,261
We're so happy here.

557
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,773
One more week
won't change anything.

558
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,639
- Where will you put it?
- I don't know.

559
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,180
Kick to the side.
One, two, three, four!

560
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,044
Kick straight ahead.
To the side.

561
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,277
One, two, three, four!
Straight ahead.

562
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,980
To the side.
One, two, three, four!

563
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,918
Do you hate Francis
for not being there for Margot?

564
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,766
Well, I think it sucks, for sure,

565
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:01,100
but I can't force him.

566
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,140
And Margot has me.
I have her.

567
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,766
We have each other.

568
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,006
Sometimes I ask myself...

569
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,779
why I stay with Charles,

570
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,218
my phantom husband.

571
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:21,280
I think your setup's all right.

572
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,357
You're never together to bicker.

573
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,156
Or do anything,
if you know what I mean.

574
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,128
Take a lover.

575
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,972
No, don't be stupid, Janine.

576
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,408
I'm tired of depending
on someone...

577
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,486
always wondering
what he's doing on his trips.

578
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:58,394
Okay, let's switch identities for fun.

579
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:03,695
Janine: Single mother
with no income,

580
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,291
no fixed residence,

581
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,167
forced to crash
at her friend's house

582
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:13,005
until she has the cash to go
start a new life in California.

583
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:20,140
You know, it sure
sounds good to me...

584
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,777
having my own home,

585
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,549
sitting in my own kitchen,

586
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:29,023
choosing the right color...

587
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:32,358
raspberry red
or cranberry red.

588
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,227
Speaking of decorating...

589
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,376
This is the piece for Mrs. Pépin.

590
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,812
Show it to her.
If she likes it, buy it.

591
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:55,249
This is the dealer's
address in Montréal.

592
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,219
Be careful, he closes at 5:00.

593
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,745
You pay him cash, no taxes.
Got that?

594
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,391
Would you mind
babysitting tonight?

595
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,294
Of course not.
I'd be glad to.

596
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:14,195
Ask for Dr. Leclerc.
He's Grandma's friend, Jean-Claude.

597
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,068
Remember him?

598
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,471
Here, take a taxi home.

599
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,741
Will you be okay
on your own?

600
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,940
I'm not four anymore.

601
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,686
Mom!

602
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,597
I'm not here to lecture you.

603
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,929
But you and your boyfriend
should have been careful.

604
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,965
- You're pregnant.
- No way.

605
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,511
I've never made love, not once!

606
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,342
It happens, Marguerite.

607
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:01,544
You're not the first
14-year-old girl to have sex.

608
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,521
- But condoms...
- Stuff your condoms!

609
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,355
I've never made love or even
come close, understand?

610
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,860
And I'm in no hurry.

611
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,690
Couldn't it be mono?

612
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:21,437
You're of legal age to make
your own decision.

613
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,372
But you're still
a young adolescent.

614
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,045
I can refer you
to an abortion clinic.

615
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,910
The staff is very competent.

616
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:36,684
But you should talk it over
with your mom first.

617
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,753
Marguerite!

618
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,712
Come on, baby!

619
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,861
Thanks again.

620
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,461
It's to celebrate having met.

621
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,332
Thank you.

622
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:38,363
In this heat, maybe we could
have sangria in the garden.

623
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,272
I love Naïve art.

624
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,874
It exaggerates expressions

625
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,146
we don't dare show in real life.

626
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,082
Does she live nearby?

627
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,751
A six-hour flight
from here, in England.

628
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,193
Like the rest of my family.

629
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,389
Do you miss them?

630
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,558
A lot.

631
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,067
But love...

632
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,854
My daughter, Anaïs.

633
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,925
Do you have children?

634
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,055
Yes.

635
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:38,795
- Two.
- She's very sociable.

636
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,965
No, it's been so long.
I wouldn't want to...

637
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,810
- Are you all right?
- Yes!

638
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,143
It's the sangria, I...

639
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,876
- where's your bathroom?
- On the right.

640
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,506
You had kids at a young age.

641
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:22,568
Today, you have
a fascinating job.

642
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,876
I can't wait to go back to work.

643
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,546
I'm used to a lifestyle
that's more...

644
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:40,624
And with my husband
who's never there,

645
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,063
I have no time for myself.

646
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:48,767
But that doesn't stop me
from wanting another.

647
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,604
Does your husband?

648
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,505
Not now.

649
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:02,780
But I've thought about
giving him a big surprise.

650
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,657
Don't be crazy!

651
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,658
I don't want to judge you.

652
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,768
You're so young.

653
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,644
Everything's still possible.

654
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,075
Absent husbands...

655
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,888
believe me,
I know what it's like.

656
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:04,436
Michèle, don't waste your money
on the machines.

657
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:08,143
There's a poker game tonight.

658
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,914
- We're one man short.
- Sorry, I can't.

659
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,818
Sure you can.

660
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,723
- We're not pros and the ante's $5.
- Thanks, but I have to go home.

661
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,461
Come on, Michèle.
11:00 tonight.

662
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,327
Forget it.

663
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,335
I've never made love in my life.

664
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,338
With nobody, guy or girl.

665
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,499
Or any... guinea pig!

666
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,236
No one!

667
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,540
I swear to God and spit on it!

668
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,547
Yuck, you spat on Rosalie!

669
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,415
Stop it, she's clean enough.

670
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,252
You'll drown her.

671
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,085
Here, take this.

672
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:59,158
It may sound corny, but...

673
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,205
I want my first time
to be special.

674
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,604
With the man of my life!

675
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,235
Maybe not my whole life,

676
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,109
but a boyfriend
I've dated a long time.

677
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:14,275
We have to be deeply in love.

678
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:17,218
I'd hate it to be just anyone.

679
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,281
Maybe it was an angel.

680
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,417
Whatever.

681
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:30,426
- Did you take religion in school?
- Because?

682
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,527
Well, like the Virgin,
Jesus' mother.

683
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:39,303
Maybe it's true if we still talk
about it 2000 years later.

684
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,469
Yeah, right.

685
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:44,240
What does that make you,
the Virgin Margot?

686
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,839
Yeah.

687
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,820
Great timing.
How are you?

688
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,194
Fine.

689
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,790
Where were you?
Did you leave the kids alone?

690
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,336
I didn't notice the time.

691
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:10,305
Besides, they're not
kids anymore.

692
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,653
Shoot, this isn't
how I raised them!

693
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,991
They're teenagers all right.

694
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:33,961
How you raise your girl
is your business, Michèle.

695
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,022
But when you're responsible
for my children,

696
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,898
I expect a modicum
of responsibility.

697
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,869
Not kids?

698
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:45,669
Alexandre's only eight!
What if there'd been an accident?

699
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,905
Come on! Janine!

700
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,947
Relax, everything's cool.

701
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,347
Hello, my darling.

702
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,682
- Aren't you a little too close?
- No.

703
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:00,518
"How the Virgin became pregnant."

704
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,718
- "The Songs of Paradise."
- That sounds good.

705
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,252
How do you think the Virgin got pregnant?

706
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,924
Gross!

707
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:17,967
"Young virgin
knocked up and nailed."

708
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,440
Excellent!

709
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,708
FREE PORN!
FREE ANAL VIDEOS!

710
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,849
Hello, darling.

711
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,617
What are you up to?

712
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:38,092
Not much.

713
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,266
Well, you see,

714
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:50,272
someone sent us the link.
But it's dumb, the site is...

715
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,071
Yeah, it's really dumb.
It's totally gross.

716
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:58,672
I swear, we didn't do it on purpose.
It's not our fault!

717
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,577
- You!
- Don't you touch her!

718
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:08,784
No Internet in this house
until I say so.

719
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:11,656
Go to bed!

720
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,390
- I'm turning it off.
- Gabrielle!

721
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:38,051
She didn't share penis stories on the Net
before your daughter arrived.

722
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,525
Maybe it was time she did.

723
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,602
Mom?

724
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:01,605
How did the Virgin Mary
have Jesus?

725
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,779
I mean, how did she conceive
if she was a virgin?

726
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:10,877
Interested in religion now?
You said it was stupid.

727
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:15,653
Gaby's putting ideas in your head.
I'm surprised you go for it.

728
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:24,161
- What are you doing?
- I can't sleep. I'm going out.

729
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,964
See you, sweetie.

730
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:48,515
I see your 10 and raise you 5.

731
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,401
I call.

732
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:23,216
Ray, this must be worth 400 bucks.

733
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,784
- Come on, Michèle!
- No, look.

734
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,557
How much?

735
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,928
We'll play more another time.

736
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,331
Ray...

737
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,700
$100.

738
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:47,750
Thank you!

739
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:50,342
Okay, let's go.

740
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:35,021
Good Lord!

741
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,067
- You're not in bed?
- Insomnia.

742
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,308
I shouldn't have blamed you
for the Internet thing.

743
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,649
I should've stayed here.

744
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,494
Michèle, what are you doing?

745
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,929
I'm a wreck.

746
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,900
My head's spinning.

747
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,459
Your cigarette!

748
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,545
Scott called last night.

749
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,058
He's looking for you.

750
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,117
Your mom told him you're here.

751
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,390
Of course.

752
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,455
He wants his money back.

753
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,730
I said I didn't know
where you were.

754
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:51,467
Janine!

755
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,476
He asked me to tell you
to take care of yourself.

756
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,445
Look, Janine,
I wanted to say...

757
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,478
Thank you.

758
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,349
Thank you, Janine.

759
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:09,117
Take two aspirins
with lots of water.

760
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,793
Hello, this is
a message for Charles.

761
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:54,962
Actually, I'm not sure
I have the right number.

762
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,528
But anyway...

763
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,837
Charles, I just
wanted to tell you

764
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,072
I really enjoyed our time
together the other day.

765
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:06,240
I've thought
about you ever since.

766
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:08,374
I'm being direct and sincere.

767
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,544
I'm waiting for you.

768
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,528
Hello?

769
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:24,122
Mrs. Pépin!
Hello, how are you?

770
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:29,765
Okay, time to let your inner
demons out! Aerobox!

771
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:33,072
Is this a bad time?

772
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,874
Mrs. Pépin says she paid cash,

773
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:41,144
but she didn't get her bench.

774
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,852
That's a big sum to forget.

775
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,356
I didn't say you could sit.

776
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,431
I needed it.

777
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,627
- What?!
- It's temporary, a loan.

778
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,863
I'll pay you in a few days.

779
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,702
Lie to others, but not me.

780
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:08,403
- I was in a bind.
- I'm not naïve. I know you.

781
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,879
You're irresponsible,
you have no respect for others.

782
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,213
You have no morals.

783
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:18,310
You'd rob your mother
for a game of cards.

784
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:21,185
And your daughter and yourself,
if you could!

785
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,090
Easy, you control freak!

786
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,757
How can you feel so superior?

787
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:32,392
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but you're all alone...

788
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,868
no husband around,
your kids mock you,

789
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:38,703
- and you have no friends.
- Aside from you, you leech!

790
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,401
You're frustrated.
You know what?

791
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,671
You resent my freedom.

792
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,838
You're afraid of me
'cause I have guts!

793
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,724
I never want to see you again!

794
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,985
It's better that way anyway.

795
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:28,512
Uptight people like that
freak me out.

796
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,652
Californians are
way more laid back.

797
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:35,720
What will we live on?

798
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:37,925
We'll need gas to get there.

799
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,264
Don't worry, it's all planned.

800
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,896
I already have a job lined up.

801
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,969
Chloé's going to be
so happy to see us!

802
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,108
I have a bit of money,
if it helps.

803
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:56,049
You're sweet, but
everything's under control.

804
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,197
How about a video game?

805
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,602
Video arcades suck.

806
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,731
I'm going to pee.

807
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,447
What's your problem?
I want my cash!

808
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,116
Shush, I can feel
the jackpot coming!

809
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,897
Good bye.
I'm going to hitchhike back.

810
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:20,925
I hope a pervert picks me up
and fucks me up the ass!

811
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,682
- Grandpa!
- Where are you?

812
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:44,783
It's Mom. She's being swallowed up
by a video poker machine.

813
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,186
See if there's anything
good on the radio.

814
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,720
Are you going
to sulk much longer?

815
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,558
Margot, lighten up.
I'll pay you back.

816
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:33,065
No wonder Dad didn't
want to be with you.

817
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:41,548
All I can say is
that I wanted you.

818
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,082
Ever wonder what I want?

819
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:52,053
A handsome boyfriend,

820
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,586
stretch jeans, new CDs,
and lots of love.

821
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:03,071
All I want, Mom, is real simple:

822
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,638
I don't want to be like you.

823
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,669
It's this one.

824
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:16,142
It's a mess inside.
I use it mostly to store tools.

825
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,043
That's my toy.

826
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:22,682
Lucien, I can't
thank you enough.

827
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,413
I'm glad to help this time,
especially for the kid.

828
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,050
But get a grip on yourself.

829
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:34,186
You're worth more than that.

830
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,787
All this is ridiculous.

831
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:38,128
Your daughter deserves
better than that.

832
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,563
Come on, come see.

833
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,068
Margot, come see!

834
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,917
You've never slept with a girl?

835
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,112
No, it's just...

836
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:37,124
if I'm too nervous,
I come too fast.

837
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,422
Worried about
premature ejaculation?

838
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,360
Roofies are the thing.

839
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,295
What's that?

840
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,094
Rohypnol.

841
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:49,001
- It stops you from coming?
- No, it makes you forget everything.

842
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,369
It's the size of an aspirin.

843
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,466
You bang a girl and the next day,
she's forgotten all about it.

844
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,670
Takes the stress out.

845
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,042
Yeah, right!

846
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,172
Hi.

847
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,614
Gaby!

848
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,181
Little ladybug!

849
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:09,190
I thought we could go visit Margot
at the campground.

850
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:13,319
Olivier, since you're the only one
with a car, I thought...

851
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,193
Great idea.

852
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:17,857
Not now.

853
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,594
Sorry, I have a date.

854
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,304
Did you put roofies
in my juice?

855
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,813
What?

856
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,975
Rohypnol.

857
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,746
Come on.

858
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,322
Maybe that's what
happened to Margot.

859
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,827
The night she passed out.

860
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:27,196
- I don't get it.
- Sure, at the club.

861
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,999
The night you and Olivier
met her there.

862
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,632
This is going
to sound pretty wild.

863
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,074
I don't know where to start.

864
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:37,578
I don't know if it makes sense.

865
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:41,138
- Who's on the phone?
- Shit!

866
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:46,311
Hi, Marguerite.

867
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:49,448
Look, I'm truly sorry
about what's happening.

868
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:52,983
I never understood why my dad
has a trailer in that dump.

869
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:57,122
Anyway, Gabrielle can't
talk to you right now.

870
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,066
She's restructuring her life.

871
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:04,731
She needs to spend time alone,
without visitors or calls.

872
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,834
So have a nice day,
and enjoy the lovely weather.

873
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:11,311
Bye!

874
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:21,081
It's for your own good, dear.

875
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,786
Don't you have piano practice?

876
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:28,796
Marguerite is pregnant.

877
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,395
Excuse me?

878
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,936
Marguerite is pregnant.

879
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,436
It's not surprising.

880
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,310
She's as irresponsible
as her mom.

881
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,848
Do you understand now, dear?

882
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,579
Do you understand?
It's for your own good.

883
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,450
We have to help her.

884
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,581
Mind your own business.

885
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,648
Is that clear?

886
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,698
Ladybug's dreaming
of her boyfriend!

887
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,003
Leave me alone!

888
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,636
You're dumb, you're vulgar,
and you're a pest!

889
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,988
"I'd never choose her
as my mom.

890
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,855
No way!

891
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:08,158
I want to live
with Margot in California.

892
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,630
That would be totally awesome.

893
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,827
Margot's so lucky!

894
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,870
Me, I'm stuck here with...

895
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,964
Hitler!"

896
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,669
Mom, tell him to stop!

897
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,802
Lock him away or something!

898
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,412
Mom, tell him to stop!

899
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,222
Mom, are you all right?

900
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,355
How long have you
been spying on me?

901
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,499
Who do you think you are?

902
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:54,801
And what about me?

903
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,367
What does that make me?

904
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,710
Your plaything?

905
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,017
Your doll?

906
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:07,446
You can't control me anymore!

907
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,186
I have a boyfriend now.

908
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,227
You didn't know that, did you?

909
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:17,595
And you know what?
You can't do anything about it!

910
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,795
And one day,
I'll make love with him.

911
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,340
Me...

912
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,377
your daughter!

913
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,639
I'm fed up with you
controlling me.

914
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:41,778
- I'm fed up with living with you!
- Gabrielle, come here!

915
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:53,460
Since he's retired, all your dad does
is make a mess.

916
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:56,834
I spend my life
cleaning up after him.

917
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:03,509
Can we drop
by the esthetician later?

918
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:06,308
Have you tried her new cream?

919
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:09,111
It's done wonders for my hands.
Look!

920
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:18,522
I can't fathom why people
insist on having pets.

921
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:22,620
They stink, they're dirty,
they're noisy.

922
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,997
This is so much better.

923
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:29,868
You can enjoy their beauty
without the inconvenience.

924
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:34,534
I don't know how you put up
with Gaby's furry pet.

925
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,909
She hates me.

926
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:42,541
One more reason to get rid of it.

927
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,986
I read her diary.

928
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:54,759
I had no idea I was
such an awful mother.

929
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:00,364
I don't know my own daughter.

930
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,772
And she calls me Hitler.

931
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,970
You do have a little moustache.

932
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:14,015
Laser's the way of the future!

933
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:17,051
I'm thinking
of having my legs done.

934
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,460
That's adolescence.
It's normal.

935
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,459
My baby!

936
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:39,198
Get a hold of yourself!

937
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,708
Don't let her walk all over you!

938
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:46,111
Gaby's been influenced
by Michèle and Margot.

939
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:50,641
I told you not to take in
those two airheads.

940
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,050
Take my advice.

941
01:19:56,124 --> 01:20:00,458
Be firm with Gaby or you'll find her
with a needle in her arm.

942
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,696
I can't handle it anymore.

943
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,261
I'm losing it,
I've hit rock bottom.

944
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:13,807
I need help, Mom.

945
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:19,179
Come on.

946
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,874
Come on, Janine.

947
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:25,343
I raised you to have more grit.

948
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:30,381
If I'd given in to my emotions
at your age,

949
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:34,827
your brother and you
wouldn't have all you have now.

950
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,995
We'd have had
real problems then.

951
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,163
Come on.

952
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,933
A bit of shopping
will pick you up.

953
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,201
Come on.

954
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:50,176
Mom?

955
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:54,940
It will pass.

956
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,984
Believe me.

957
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:58,849
Come on.

958
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:27,508
Tips aren't included.

959
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,847
Have an excellent day, sir!

960
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:44,158
Why, a new face!

961
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:46,427
Two hotdogs and fries, please.

962
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,741
Keep going, take it all off!

963
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,007
Where's my mother?

964
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:04,483
Some posit that every experience
is worth living.

965
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:06,611
Do you agree?

966
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:11,453
It must be hard for a woman
with your brains and drive

967
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:15,462
to find herself in such
abject circumstances.

968
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:19,193
Do you have to teach philosophy
to spout such crap?

969
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:22,259
And with your daughter, too.

970
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,271
Michèle...

971
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,466
I've got $100.

972
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,668
What do you have to offer?

973
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:32,304
- Tell your wife I sucked you off.
- Sucked me off?

974
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:36,316
You?

975
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:39,615
That's worth more than $100.

976
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,486
- $200?
- Go to hell!

977
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,855
$300?

978
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:48,726
If you go to the casino
tonight with $300,

979
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,527
you'll leave with how much?

980
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:53,567
Twice that?

981
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,660
Three times?

982
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:03,306
Michèle...

983
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:06,541
do you want
to get Margot out of here?

984
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,993
Hello, darling!

985
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,044
Béatrice, this is Charles,

986
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,180
the man of my life.

987
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,921
I've heard lots about you.

988
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:12,644
I have to make a few calls.
A big client.

989
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:15,342
I'll be back.

990
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:41,665
Come on, Michèle!

991
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:52,850
That's good.

992
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,852
That's it.

993
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,625
That feels good.

994
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:03,425
Yes, keep going.

995
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,635
That's it, eat me.

996
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:12,104
You like it, I can tell.

997
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,467
A real pro.

998
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:20,646
Yes, that's it.

999
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:23,183
You're a slut like your mom.

1000
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:26,220
No, don't stop.
Keep going!

1001
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:30,053
Do it for yourself,
for your daughter.

1002
01:25:57,385 --> 01:25:59,615
Hello, darling.

1003
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:04,858
You sure have
a gift for fucking up.

1004
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,292
Did you come here to preach?

1005
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,928
I came to see Margot, not you.

1006
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,264
She hardly talked to me.

1007
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:17,270
But who'd want to chat,

1008
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,966
living in a shithole like this?

1009
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:22,305
She didn't deserve it,

1010
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:24,675
especially not in her condition.

1011
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,177
Will she have an abortion?

1012
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:32,811
I went to see Jean-Claude
for my hormones.

1013
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:37,155
He was worried,
he hadn't heard from her.

1014
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,125
He blurted it out.

1015
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,162
He thought I knew.

1016
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:43,197
And he thought right.

1017
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:46,324
I should have known,
don't you think?

1018
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,892
So I pretended I did.

1019
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:52,303
You're taking hormones?

1020
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:53,897
How's Jean-Claude?

1021
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:56,273
Michèle, really!

1022
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:58,539
Couldn't you have told me?

1023
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,672
I mean, I'm your mother!

1024
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:02,773
I guess we don't
choose our mom.

1025
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,377
Funny, that's exactly
what Margot told me.

1026
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,796
Michèle, come on!

1027
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:24,805
Mimi!

1028
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,377
What's going on?

1029
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:46,585
It'll be okay, darling.

1030
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:52,190
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1031
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:04,845
It'll be okay.

1032
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,715
I'm sorry, Béatrice.

1033
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:16,018
Charles isn't himself.
He works too hard.

1034
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:21,052
We'll take a vacation soon.

1035
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,097
I should be going.

1036
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:24,927
It's late and my kids are waiting.

1037
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:14,544
I got my first paycheck.

1038
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:19,052
It's just part
of the money I...

1039
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,883
that I owe you.

1040
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,391
Margot...

1041
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,325
I want you to know...

1042
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:35,295
I know my life's a mess,

1043
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,305
I know you deserve a way
better mother than me...

1044
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:43,176
but you're the most
precious thing I have.

1045
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:46,541
I love you.

1046
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:49,607
I love you.

1047
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,811
I love you.

1048
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:54,081
And I'm here for you.

1049
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:59,354
Completely... any time,
for any reason, always.

1050
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:02,828
And you can tell me anything,
no matter what...

1051
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,922
I'm pregnant.

1052
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:12,565
Don't ask any questions.

1053
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:20,079
I hate him!

1054
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:26,251
I'm ashamed.

1055
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:32,022
- I'm scared.
- It's okay, it will work out.

1056
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:52,137
This is for you.

1057
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:56,573
Is that me?

1058
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:15,429
I love you!

1059
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,942
Turn over, I'll rub your back.

1060
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:12,423
That feels good.

1061
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,787
Dad?

1062
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:51,661
Dad!

1063
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:54,394
Hi, little man!

1064
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,537
We'll play later.

1065
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:13,420
Janine, I...

1066
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:35,205
Hello, my big girl.

1067
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:39,445
Yes, I'm fine, thanks.

1068
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:41,777
Is my Gaby here?

1069
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:43,646
Gaby!

1070
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:50,323
- Hi, Grandpa!
- Hello, angel.

1071
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:53,849
- Are you ready?
- I'll grab my stuff.

1072
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:56,590
- We're off to a movie.
- No...

1073
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:59,224
no, no, we're having guests
over for dinner.

1074
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,531
I promised her. We wanted
to treat ourselves.

1075
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:05,128
Have dinner with us.

1076
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:08,539
You can see the movie
tomorrow or whenever.

1077
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:17,042
Hello, Béatrice.

1078
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:22,847
Thanks for the invitation.

1079
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:29,921
I was feeling a bit lonely tonight.

1080
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,336
You look ravishing.

1081
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:41,034
You're right on time.
Kids?

1082
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:52,141
This is my father, Lucien.

1083
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:54,915
- Hello. It's a pleasure.
- My son, Alexandre.

1084
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:01,020
And you know Charles.

1085
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:10,330
Everybody, this is Kate,
Dad's other wife,

1086
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:13,339
and their daughter, Anaïs.
Gabrielle?

1087
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:17,103
Gabrielle, this is Kate.

1088
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:21,706
Hello, Gabrielle.
I'm very happy to meet you.

1089
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:24,012
You're bigger than I thought.

1090
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:27,248
Kate is Dad's other wife.

1091
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:29,721
Let's eat and get
to know each other.

1092
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:32,122
I prepared dinner.

1093
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:35,321
Dad, what's going on?

1094
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:52,745
Gosh, sit down. I want to enjoy
this lovely time before I leave.

1095
01:35:52,813 --> 01:35:55,213
- You're leaving?
- Yes, missy.

1096
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:57,045
I'm leaving...

1097
01:35:58,486 --> 01:36:00,716
for Europe

1098
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:05,248
to hitchhike
and smoke some pot!

1099
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:09,527
Don't look so stunned, Gaby.
You must have smoked too.

1100
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:13,055
I'm 20 years late,
but better late than never.

1101
01:36:15,503 --> 01:36:17,130
Dad?

1102
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:23,375
- Dad, what's going on?
- This was Gaby's birthday.

1103
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:26,709
They grow so fast.

1104
01:36:40,494 --> 01:36:42,519
Dad!
