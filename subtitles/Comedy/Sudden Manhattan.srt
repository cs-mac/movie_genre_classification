1
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
"Chapter one. "

2
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,200
"He adored New York City.
He idolised it all out of proportion. "

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Uh, no. Make that "He romanticised it
all out of proportion. "

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,300
"To him,
no matter what the season was,

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,800
this was still a town
that existed in black and white

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,200
and pulsated to the great tunes
of George Gershwin. "

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,900
Uh... no. Let me start this over.

8
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,100
"Chapter one. "

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,100
"He was too romantic about Manhattan,
as he was about everything else. "

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,900
"He thrived on the hustle, bustle
of the crowds and the traffic. "

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,200
"To him, New York
meant beautiful women

12
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,200
and street-smart guys
who seemed to know all the angles. "

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Ah, corny. Too corny
for a man of my taste.

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,600
Let me... try and make it more profound.

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,900
"Chapter one. He adored New York City. "

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,400
"To him, it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture. "

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,600
"The same lack of integrity to cause so
many people to take the easy way out...

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,800
"The same lack of integrity to cause so
many people to take the easy way out...

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,700
... was rapidly turning the town
of his dreams..."

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,300
No, it's gonna be too preachy. I mean,
face it, I wanna sell some books here.

21
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,100
"Chapter one. He adored New York City,

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,200
although to him it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture. "

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,300
"How hard it was to exist in a society
desensitised by drugs, loud music,

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,900
television, crime, garbage..."

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,600
Too angry. I don't wanna be angry.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,000
"Chapter one. "

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,100
"He was as tough and romantic
as the city he loved. "

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,100
"Behind his black-rimmed glasses was
the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat. "

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,800
I love this.

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,300
"New York was his town
and it always would be. "

31
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,600
I think the essence of art is to provide
a kind of working-through situation,

32
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,200
so that you can get in touch
with feelings you didn't know you had.

33
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,600
Talent is luck.
The important thing in life is courage.

34
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,000
- They've had this argument for 20 years.
- Listen to this example.

35
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,200
If the four of us are walking home over
the bridge and a person was drowning,

36
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,300
would we have the nerve...

37
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,300
Would one of us have the nerve
to dive into the icy water and save them?

38
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,200
It's a key question.

39
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,000
I, of course, can't swim,
so I never have to face it.

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,900
Oh... God.

41
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Which of us?

42
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,300
- You want a little more?
- No.

43
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,700
Mm. Oh, man. That is so great.

44
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
You don't smoke.

45
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,400
I know I don't smoke. I don't inhale
because it gives you cancer, but

46
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,300
I look so incredibly handsome
with a cigarette that I can't not hold one.

47
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,500
You like the way I look?

48
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,900
Provocative.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,200
- I'm getting through to you?
- Yup. You have to excuse me a sec.

50
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,400
Jesus, she's gorgeous.

51
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
But she's 17.

52
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,900
I'm 42 and she's 17.

53
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,700
I'm... I'm older than her father.
Can you believe that?

54
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,300
I'm dating a girl
wherein I can beat up her father.

55
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,200
That's the first time
that ever occurred in my life.

56
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,200
- He's drunk.
- You're drunk. You should never drink.

57
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,900
Did I tell you... that my ex-wife...

58
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,600
- Who, Tina?
- My second ex- wife

59
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,700
is writing a book about
our marriage and the break-up.

60
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,900
- That's really tacky.
- It's really depressing, you know.

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,800
She's gonna give all those details out,
all my little idiosyncrasies,

62
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,300
and my quirks and mannerisms, and...

63
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Not that I have
anything to hide because, you know...

64
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,100
But there are a few disgusting
little moments that I regret.

65
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,200
It's just gossip.
Gossip is the new pornography.

66
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,800
- You should never let me drink.
- I know.

67
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,100
You should never let yourself drink.

68
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,000
We oughta go
cos I've got an exam tomorrow.

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,400
Oh, do you? The kid's gotta get up...

70
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
She's got homework.
I'm dating a girl who does homework.

71
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,200
What is it? What's the matter with you?

72
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,400
You... you... Where are you now?
Your mind is like a million miles away.

73
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,500
I have something I wanna say.

74
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I, uh, I just didn't know
quite how to... get into it.

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,700
Um, I, uh...

76
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,100
About seven or eight weeks ago
I went to this dinner party

77
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,100
and I met a woman there.

78
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,200
And...

79
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,000
- And I've got kind of involved with her.
- You're kidding?

80
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,900
It started out very casually.
I mean, we had lunch a couple of times.

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,600
And now it's, you know, it's getting out of
hand and I don't know what to do about it.

82
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,700
I mean, I'm... It's scary.

83
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, who is she? What are the details?

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, she's a journalist.

85
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,000
She's very...

86
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,700
- Is she married, too?
- No, no.

87
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
She's very beautiful.

88
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,200
She's very kind of
nervous, high-strung, illusive.

89
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,700
Great. It sounds wonderful.

90
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Oh, she is wonderful.
I mean, she's on my mind all the time.

91
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:50,100
What are you telling me? That your
marriage is... I mean, how serious is it?

92
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know, but it's pretty serious.

93
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,700
- But you haven't said anything to Emily?
- No! God, no.

94
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,200
It's amazing. I'm stunned
because, of all the people I know,

95
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,400
I always thought for sure that you
and Emily had one of the best marriages.

96
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,600
I always thought for sure that you
and Emily had one of the best marriages.

97
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,000
We do! I mean, I love her.

98
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,500
- But you're seeing...
- I know it.

99
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,400
But in all the years
that we've been married

100
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,800
I've had, what... one or two
very minor things with other women.

101
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,000
I mean, very... I hate the whole idea. I hate
myself when I'm doing this sort of thing.

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,400
But this is just, you know...
This is not like that.

103
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,700
It's terrible. Listen,
you shouldn't ask me for advice.

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,000
When it comes to relationships, I'm the
winner of the August Strindberg Award.

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,700
Well, I don't think 17 is too young.
Beside that, she's a bright girl.

106
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,200
You'll get no argument from me.
I think she's terrific.

107
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,600
He could do a lot worse.
He has done a lot worse.

108
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,300
I just think he's wasting his life.

109
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,100
He writes that crap for television.

110
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,100
Yale, have you ever thought
any more about having kids?

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
Oh, my God. Kids.

112
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Listen, I've gotta get this book finished.
It's never gonna get done.

113
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,800
I've gotta get the money
to get this magazine started, huh?

114
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Kids...

115
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,300
We always talk about moving to
Connecticut. You could do it there.

116
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,800
- Connecticut.
- Yeah.

117
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,300
I can't go to Connecticut. It's not practical.

118
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,400
All my stuff's here.

119
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,000
My work's here.
It's just the wrong time.

120
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,600
What about Isaac?
We can't abandon him, you know?

121
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,900
He can't function anywhere
other than New York, you know that.

122
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
Very Freudian.

123
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,800
- Are you writing a book on our marriage?
- Leave me alone.

124
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,500
- Are you writing about our break-up?
- We've said all that needs to be said.

125
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,700
I know you are because
I have a friend at Random House.

126
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,800
- I'm free to do as I please.
- Yeah, but this affects me.

127
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,700
So you're gonna tell everybody
everything? Our life, our sexual life?

128
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,200
Do you spy on me?

129
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,100
No. I was at a party and a guy said
he read an advance chapter

130
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,900
of a book my wife was writing,
and it was hot stuff. He said that!

131
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,000
- I spilled wine on my pants.
- I don't care to discuss it.

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,600
- You won't discuss it. How's Willie?
- Fine.

133
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,100
Well, give me some details. Does he
play baseball? Wear dresses? What?

134
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,900
He doesn't wear dresses. You'll find out
the details when it's your turn to see him.

135
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't write this book.
It's a humiliating experience.

136
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,300
It's an honest account of our break-up.

137
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,700
Jesus, everybody that knows us
is gonna know everything.

138
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,000
Look at you. You're so threatened.

139
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm not threatened because I was not
the immoral, psychotic, promiscuous one.

140
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
I hope I didn't leave out anything.

141
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,600
Are you telling me that... that... that I'm...
that you had three affairs before me?

142
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,100
That's really hard to believe.
It's mind-boggling.

143
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,300
When I was your age, I was still being
tucked in by my grandparents.

144
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,500
When I was your age, I was still being
tucked in by my grandparents.

145
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,100
Well, they were really immature boys.
They were nothing like you.

146
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,800
Well, they were really immature boys.
They were nothing like you.

147
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,900
No? What does that mean?

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,200
Well, I told you before.
I think I'm in love with you.

149
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,500
Hey, don't get carried away, OK?

150
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,100
This is... This is a terrific thing
- Move over- you know.

151
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,100
And we're having a great time, but you're
a kid and I never want you to forget that.

152
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,100
You're gonna meet
a lot of terrific men in your life

153
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,300
and, you know, I want you to enjoy me.

154
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,500
My wry sense of humour
and astonishing sexual technique,

155
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,600
My wry sense of humour
and astonishing sexual technique,

156
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,800
but never forget that you've...
you've got your whole life ahead of you.

157
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't you have any feelings for me?

158
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,800
How can you ask that?
I've got nothing but feelings for you,

159
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,600
but you don't wanna get hung up
with one person at your age.

160
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,900
It's... charming, you know.

161
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,100
Erotic. No question about that.

162
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,700
As long as the cops don't burst in, I think
we're gonna break a couple of records.

163
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,100
But you can't, uh, you can't...
It's not a good thing.

164
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,600
You should think of me sort of
as a detour on the highway of life.

165
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,500
- So get dressed because you gotta go.
- Don't you want me to stay over?

166
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,800
I don't want you to get in the habit

167
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:28,000
because first you stay one night, then
two nights, and then you're living here.

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It's not a great idea.

169
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,500
You won't like it, believe me.
I'm tough to get along with.

170
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Tomorrow we'll go to the cinema and I'll
show you the Veronica Lake movie. OK?

171
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,200
OK. Veronica Lake's
the pin-up with the red hair?

172
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,400
No, that's Rita Hayworth.
Do we have to go over this all the time?

173
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,200
- Rita who?
- Rita Hayworth. Are you joking with me?

174
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:58,600
Course I'm joking! You think I'm unaware
of any event pre-Paul McCartney.

175
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,000
- I find these photographs interesting.
- Yes, so do I.

176
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,800
- Do you ever use the camera I got you?
- Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.

177
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,700
I was taking pictures in our drama class.
It's fun, really neat.

178
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,600
You know you sound like
the mouse in Tom And Jerry.

179
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,100
Are you kidding me?

180
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,800
- You should talk! You've a whiny voice!
- You sound like the mouse.

181
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,700
Well, thanks.

182
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,900
I know, I'm a whiner.

183
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,300
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

184
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,400
- How long have you been here?
- We were talking about you.

185
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,100
That's hilarious. Wh... What... Were you
walking around behind us or what?

186
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,500
- How are you? Hi.
- Good. That's funny. We were talking...

187
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,600
We're gonna go to
the Shakespeare In The Park thing.

188
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,700
Oh, yeah, right. I wanna do that.

189
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,400
Oh, this is my friend.
Mary Wilke, Isaac Davis and Tracy.

190
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,700
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

191
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,000
You, too.

192
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,800
- Hello.
- Hi.

193
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,000
We were downstairs.
We saw the photography exhibition.

194
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
- Absolutely incredible.
- It's really good.

195
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,300
Really?

196
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,000
- The photographs downstairs?
- Yes.

197
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,300
- Great. Absolutely great. Did you?
- No, I really felt it was very derivative.

198
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,100
To me it looked like it was straight out of
Diane Arbus, but it had none of the wit.

199
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,900
Well, we didn't like it
as much as the Plexiglas sculpture.

200
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,700
You liked the Plexiglas?

201
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,100
- You didn't like the Plexiglas either?
- Ah, that's interesting. Nah, no...

202
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,000
It was a lot better than
that... that steel cube. Did you see it?

203
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
- Oh, yeah. That was the worst.
- Now that was brilliant to me.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
- Oh, yeah. That was the worst.
- Now that was brilliant to me.

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,100
- The cube was brilliant?
- Yes.

206
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,200
To me it was very textural.
You know what I mean?

207
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,200
It was perfectly integrated and it had a...
a marvellous kind of negative capability.

208
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,300
The rest of the stuff was bullshit.

209
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
- You wanna see the Sol Lewitt?
- Sure. That'd be fun.

210
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
You wanna see that?

211
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
He opens at the Modern soon. I was
gonna do a piece on Sol for Insights.

212
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,500
Do you know that magazine?
It's a little magazine.

213
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,700
They're such schmucks up there.
Really mired in Thirties radicalism.

214
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,900
They're such schmucks up there.
Really mired in Thirties radicalism.

215
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,300
- What do you do, Tracy?
- I go to high school.

216
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Oh, really. Really. Somewhere Nabokov
is smiling, if you know what I mean.

217
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,100
LeWitt is overrated. In fact,
he may be a candidate for the academy.

218
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,500
Right!

219
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,900
Mary and I have invented the Academy
of the Overrated for such notables as

220
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,200
- Gustav Mahler,
- Isak Dinesen and Carl Jung.

221
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,700
- Scott Fitzgerald.
- Lenny Bruce. Can't forget him, can we?

222
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,700
- How about Norman Mailer?
- I think those people are all terrific.

223
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,600
- Who was that guy you had?
- I didn't. It was yours. Heinrich B? I.

224
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,400
- Overrated?
- Don't wanna leave out Heinrich.

225
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,200
Gee, what about Mozart?
You guys don't wanna leave out Mozart.

226
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,000
- Well, how about Vincent Van Goch?
- She said "Van Goch"?!

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,400
- Or Ingmar Bergman?
- You'll get in trouble.

228
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,700
Bergman? Bergman's the only genius
in cinema today, I think.

229
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,600
He's a big Bergman fan.

230
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,600
God, you're so the opposite.
You write that fabulous television show.

231
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,500
It's so funny and
his view is so Scandinavian.

232
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,700
It's bleak, my God.
I mean, all that Kierkegaard, right?

233
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Real adolescent, fashionable pessimism.
I mean, the silence. God's silence.

234
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,400
OK, OK, OK. I mean, I loved it when I was
at Radcliffe, but, all right, you outgrow it.

235
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,900
Get her away from me. I don't think
I can take too much more of her.

236
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,500
- She's really a cr...
- No. Don't you guys see?

237
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,400
It is the dignifying of one's
psychological and sexual hang-ups

238
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,300
by attaching them to these
grandiose, philosophical issues?

239
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,700
- Here we are.
- Listen, it was very nice meeting you.

240
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,700
It was a pleasure
and a sincere sensation,

241
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,900
but we have to go.
We gotta do some shopping. I forgot.

242
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,900
Hey, listen, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm just from Philadelphia, you know.
I mean, we believe in God so... OK?

244
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,200
What the hell does that mean?
What do you mean?

245
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,800
- Well, that...
- "I'm from Philadelphia. I believe in God."

246
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,600
Does this make any sense to you?

247
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,100
What a creep. Could you believe her?

248
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,800
- I mean, she was really...
- She seemed nervous.

249
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,500
Nervous? She was overbearing. She was,
you know, terrible! She was all cerebral.

250
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,100
Where the hell does a little Radcliffe
tootsie come off rating Scott Fitzgerald,

251
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,800
- Gustav Mahler and Heinrich B? I?
- Why are you getting so mad?

252
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Because I don't like that
pseudo-intellectual garbage.

253
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,400
"Van Goch!" Did you hear that? She said
Van Goch. Like an Arab she spoke.

254
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,500
One more remark about Bergman, and I'd
have knocked her other contact lens out.

255
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,600
- Is she Yale's mistress?
- That will never cease to mystify me.

256
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,800
I mean, he's got a wonderful wife
and he prefers to... to diddle this yo-yo.

257
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,500
But he was always a sucker
for those kind of women.

258
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,400
The kind that would involve him
in discussions of existential reality.

259
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,900
They probably sit on the floor
with wine and cheese,

260
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,400
and mispronounce
"allegorical" and "didacticism".

261
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,100
I get the feeling that Yale really likes her.

262
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Well, I don't believe
in extramarital relationships.

263
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,100
I think people should mate for life
like pigeons or Catholics.

264
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,300
I don't know. Maybe people weren't
meant to have one deep relationship.

265
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't know. Maybe people weren't
meant to have one deep relationship.

266
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,900
Maybe we're meant to have a series
of relationships of different lengths.

267
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,800
- That's gone out of date.
- Don't tell me what's gone out of date.

268
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,700
You're 17. You were brought up
on drugs and television and the pill.

269
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,300
I... I was World War II.
I was in the trenches.

270
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,200
- You were eight in World War II.
- Right. I was never in the trenches.

271
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,800
I was caught right in the middle.
It was a very tough position.

272
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Get the groceries, will you?

273
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,800
Good morning and welcome to
Human Beings Wow!

274
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,000
We're talking this evening with Gregory
and Caroline Payne Whitney Smith,

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
close friends of the Carter family.

276
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
We're normal people.
Just like you, we're in debt.

277
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,400
Except that Mrs Payne Whitney Smith
is a catatonic.

278
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,700
Well, we don't consider her
a catatonic, just quiet.

279
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Jesus, this is the worst.
This is really embarrassing to me.

280
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,600
- I mean, I... This is so antiseptic...
- No, wrong. That's very chancy material.

281
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,000
- How do you see this as chancy?
- Who fights more with the censor?

282
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,400
What has the censor got to do with it?
There's no substance to the comedy.

283
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,600
- You don't find this insightful?
- Worse than not insightful. It's not funny.

284
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,800
- You don't find this insightful?
- Worse than not insightful. It's not funny.

285
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,600
- There's not a legitimate laugh.
- That's funny.

286
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,200
- Look at the audience.
- You're going by audience reaction?

287
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,300
This is an audience raised on TV.

288
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,700
Their standards have been lowered
over the years.

289
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,600
They watch their sets and the gamma
rays eat the white cells of their brains out.

290
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,400
- I quit. I can't write this any more.
- Relax. Take a lude.

291
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,600
I don't want a lude. All you do is drop
ludes, then Percodans and angel dust.

292
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Naturally, it seems funny.
Anything would if you're...

293
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,700
You should abandon the show
and open a pharmaceutical house. I quit.

294
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,400
Ike, you're being silly.

295
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,700
We've talked to them about that.

296
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,400
- Don't break her neck.
- I won't. That's fine.

297
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
What did I do? I made a terrible mistake.

298
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,900
- It's the first smart thing you've done.
- I've screwed myself up completely.

299
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,500
- It's the first smart thing you've done.
- I've screwed myself up completely.

300
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,100
For about 30 seconds I was a big hero,
and now it's directly to unemployment.

301
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,300
If you need money, I'll take care of it.

302
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,100
That's not the point.
I got enough for a year.

303
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,000
If I live like Mahatma Gandhi, I'm fine.

304
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,200
My accountant says I did this
at a very bad time. My stocks are down.

305
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,400
I'm cash poor or something.
I got no cash flow.

306
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,100
I'm not liquid, something's not flowing.
They got a language all their own.

307
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,800
We discussed this. It's difficult
to live here without a big income.

308
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah, plus I got two alimonies and
child support. You know, I gotta cut down.

309
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,100
I'll have to give up my apartment.

310
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm not gonna be able to
play tennis, pick checks up at dinner,

311
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
or take the Southampton house.

312
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,700
Plus I'll probably have to give
my parents less money. It'll kill my father.

313
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,900
He's not gonna be able to get
as good a seat in the synagogue.

314
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,000
He'll be in the back, away from God,
far from the action.

315
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,100
Have you said anything to Tracy?

316
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,500
What is it... I gotta get out of that situation.
She's a young girl. What am I...? I'm...

317
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,300
You know, it's ridiculous. I mean, I...

318
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,900
What happens if the year goes by
and my book doesn't come out?

319
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,500
Your book is gonna come out.
Your book is gonna be wonderful.

320
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,700
The worst thing that can happen is
you'll learn something about yourself.

321
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,900
The worst thing that can happen is
you'll learn something about yourself.

322
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,400
Listen, I'm really proud of you.
I mean, this is a very good move.

323
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,600
This is a wonderful turnout.

324
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
The Museum of Modern Art
has been very generous.

325
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,300
And the proof of the strength
of the Equal Rights Amendment

326
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:47,400
is that so many of you who would
never do it before put on black tie tonight.

327
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,100
We love you for it.
We need you and you've come through.

328
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,200
And now no more talk. Enjoy yourselves.

329
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,000
Hi. What are you doing here?

330
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,000
Congratulations on your book.
It was terrific.

331
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,300
- Oh, thanks.
- Absolutely terrific.

332
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,900
- Listen, I'd like you to meet Isaac Davis.
- Hi, how do you do? Isaac Davis.

333
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,600
- Isaac, hello. Hi.
- Wh-what are you doing here?

334
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,700
Well, of course I'm here.

335
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,700
What a funny coincidence.
Excuse me, Isaac Davis. We met before.

336
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,600
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's all right.

337
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,400
I heard you... quit your job.

338
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,700
Yeah. A real self-destructive impulse.
I wanna write a book, so I...

339
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,900
Has anybody read that Nazis are gonna
march in New Jersey, you know?

340
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,400
We should go there,
get some guys together.

341
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,100
Get some bricks and baseball bats
and explain things to 'em.

342
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,600
There was this devastating
satirical piece on that in the Times.

343
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:52,100
Well, a satirical piece in the Times is
one thing, but bricks get right to the point.

344
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,100
But biting satire
is better that physical force.

345
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,600
No, physical force is better with Nazis.
It's hard to satirise a guy with shiny boots.

346
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,400
- Well, you get emotional, but...
- We were talking about orgasms.

347
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,400
- Oh, no, please!
- Really? I'm sorry. I didn't...

348
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,900
I'm from Philadelphia.
We never talk about such things in public.

349
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,300
You said that before.
I don't know what it meant then either.

350
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,800
I'm just about to direct a film...
of my own script.

351
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,900
The premise is this guy screws so great...

352
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,100
- Screws so great?
- Screws so great

353
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,800
that when he brings a woman to orgasm,
she's so fulfilled that she dies.

354
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,900
Now this one, excuse me,
finds this hostile.

355
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,600
It's worse than hostile.
It's aggressive-homicidal.

356
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,900
You have to forgive Dennis.
He's Harvard direct to Beverly Hills.

357
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,600
It's... Theodor Reik
with a touch of Charles Manson.

358
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,600
I finally had an orgasm and my doctor
told me it was the wrong kind.

359
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,000
Did you have the wrong kind?
I've never had the wrong kind. Ever.

360
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,400
My worst one was right on the money.

361
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,100
- Good night. It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

362
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,300
Bye-bye.

363
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,500
Oh, gee!

364
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,000
It's an interesting group of people.
Like the cast of a Fellini movie.

365
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They're such fun, such wonderful people,
and Helen is a good friend.

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
She's a brilliant woman. She's a genius.

367
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I met her through
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

368
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,800
How come you guys got divorced?
I never...

369
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,500
What do you mean
"How come we got divorced?"

370
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,300
What kind of a question is that?
I hardly know you.

371
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,500
- You don't have to tell me if you don't...
- Well, we had problems. We fought a lot.

372
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,600
I was tired of submerging my identity to
a brilliant, dominating man. He's a genius.

373
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,700
He was a genius, Helen's a genius, Dennis
is a genius. You know a lot of geniuses.

374
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,400
You should meet some stupid people.
You could learn something.

375
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,500
Well, why'd you get a divorce?

376
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,500
Why? I got a divorce because my ex-wife
left me for another woman.

377
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,200
Really?

378
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,100
- God, that must have been demoralising.
- I took it well under the circumstances.

379
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,100
- Phew-wee.
- I tried to run 'em both over with a car.

380
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,500
That's incredible sexual humiliation.

381
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,700
It's enough to turn you off women
and it accounts for the little girl.

382
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,900
Hey, the little girl is fine.
Jesus, she's... What's with the little girl?

383
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh, sure. I understand, believe me.
16 years old, no possible threat at all.

384
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, sure. I understand, believe me.
16 years old, no possible threat at all.

385
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,300
She's 17. She's gonna be eight...
Sometimes you have a losing personality.

386
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,600
I'm honest. I say what's on my mind
and if you can't take it, then fuck off.

387
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,200
I like the way you express yourself, too.
Pithy, yet degenerate.

388
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,900
- You get many dates? I don't think so.
- No, I do. I actually do.

389
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,100
I never thought I was very pretty.

390
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,300
Oh, what is pretty anyway? I hate being
pretty. It's all so subjective anyway.

391
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,100
The brightest men just drop dead
in front of a beautiful face.

392
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,300
When you climb into the sack,
if you're a bit giving, they're so grateful.

393
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,200
Yeah, I know I am.

394
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,500
- D'you have kids?
- Yeah.

395
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,600
He's being raised by two women.

396
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,700
I think it works. They made some studies,
I read in a psychoanalytic quarterly.

397
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,100
You don't need a male.
Two mothers are fine.

398
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,000
Really? Because I feel
very few people survive one mother.

399
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,500
Listen, I gotta get my dog. Wanna wait?
I gotta walk it. Are you in rush?

400
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,600
- Oh, no, sure. What kind of dog you got?
- The worst.

401
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,700
- Oh, no, sure. What kind of dog you got?
- The worst.

402
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,300
It's a dachshund.
You know, it's a penis substitute for me.

403
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,900
Oh, I would have thought then
in your case a Great Dane.

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,700
- So, you serious with Yale or what?
- Serious?

405
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,300
Well, he's married.

406
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,800
Uh, I don't know. I guess
I should straighten my life out, huh?

407
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,100
Donny my analyst always tells me...

408
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,700
- You call your analyst Donny?
- Yeah. I call him Donny!

409
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,300
I call mine Dr Chomsky, you know.
He hits me with a ruler.

410
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,400
Donny...? That's first name.

411
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,400
Donny says I get involved in situations
and that it's deliberate,

412
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,700
especially with my ex-husband Jeremiah.

413
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,600
I was his student and...

414
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,100
- Really? You married your teacher?
- Yeah, of course.

415
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,700
That's very...

416
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,000
- He failed me and I fell in love with him.
- Oh, that's perfect.

417
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,300
I was sleeping with him
and he had the nerve to give me an F.

418
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,200
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

419
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,500
Not even an Incomplete, right?
Just a straight F?

420
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,600
You got a good sense of humour.

421
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,400
Hey, thanks! I don't need you
to tell me that, you know.

422
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,000
I've been making good money off it for
years, till I quit my job to write this book.

423
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,300
Now I'm very, very nervous about it,
you know, but...

424
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
D'you wanna...?
Oh, you don't have to pay.

425
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,900
- Oh, that's OK.
- I'm serious! Wanna walk by the river?

426
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,200
- You know the time?
- What do you mean?

427
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,400
If I don't get at least 16 hours,
I'm a basket case.

428
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,400
I'd like to hear about your book.
I really would. I'm quite a good editor.

429
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah?

430
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,400
Well, my book is about
decaying values. It's about...

431
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,500
See, years ago I wrote a short story about
my mother called The Castrating Zionist

432
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:26,500
and I wanna expand it into a novel.
I could talk about my book all night.

433
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,600
Isn't it beautiful out?

434
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,500
Yeah, it's really so pretty
when the light starts to come up.

435
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,600
I know. I love it.

436
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,500
Boy, this is really a great city.
I don't care what anybody says.

437
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,000
It's really a knockout, you know.

438
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I think I better head back. I've got an
appointment with Yale for lunch later on.

439
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,200
Mm, hi.

440
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,300
No, no. No, I'm awake.

441
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Jesus, what are you...
What are you doing? It's 7.15.

442
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Oh, yeah.

443
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,300
Really?

444
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,100
You did? At the museum?

445
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,900
Yeah, well, she's very active
in the feminist movement.

446
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,700
So you're gonna go
apartment hunting with Tracy?

447
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,300
Yeah, well, you should be able
to find something. It's Isaac.

448
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Yeah, I don't think you'll have any trouble.

449
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,600
I knew you'd... see she's a terrific
woman, if you spent some time with her.

450
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,900
You still feel the same way about her?
Cos you hadn't mentioned it in a while.

451
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,200
So you... Yeah.

452
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,300
Yeah... right. I know.

453
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,800
She's great, I know. Great.

454
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,300
So... No, I gotta go apartment hunting
today. I have to get something cheaper.

455
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,000
I can't keep living where I do.
It's just...

456
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,800
- Isaac's terrific, isn't he?
- Yeah.

457
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Said he had a great time with you.

458
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Really? That's good cos I always think
he's uncomfortable around me.

459
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,400
Oh, come on.

460
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,600
- I missed you so much.
- Yale, this is ridiculous. You're married.

461
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,000
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like one of those women.

462
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It sounds terrible. I hate it.

463
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,800
- Why don't I just move out?
- No! I don't wanna break up a marriage.

464
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,400
Besides, I'm not looking for any
big involvement here. It's just... I don't...

465
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:11,400
It's crazy. It's crazy. I think about you
when you're not around.

466
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,200
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

467
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,900
I just guess I should be seeing
someone who's not married.

468
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,700
- You're so beautiful. You make me crazy.
- Oh, Yale, please stop it.

469
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,800
We're in Bloomingdale's
and someone's gonna see us.

470
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,900
Did I tell you I may have
an interview with Borges?

471
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,300
I told you that we met before. He seems
to feel very comfortable around me.

472
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,000
- Let's go somewhere and make love.
- Not now! Not now, Jesus.

473
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,300
Anyway, you've got a writing class in
an hour. Your students are gonna know.

474
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,400
You're gonna have
this big grin on your face.

475
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,500
You're gonna have
this big grin on your face.

476
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,300
And I don't wanna go to your house cos I
can't stand the dog and the phone ringing.

477
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:56,000
Can't you hold me? Does your love for me
always have to express itself sexually?

478
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
What about other values like warmth
and spiritual contact? Hotel, right?

479
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Jesus, I'm a pushover!

480
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,100
Oh, hi, Isaac.

481
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,400
- Hi. Is Willie ready?
- Yeah. Come on in.

482
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,500
He'll be right down.

483
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
- How you been, lke?
- Good. How you been?

484
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
- I've been terrific.
- Yeah?

485
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,600
Yeah. Been getting a lot of work done.
Things are going really well.

486
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,600
- Want some coffee or something?
- Uh, no. How's Willie doing?

487
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Willie's fine. He's beginning
to show some real talent in drawing.

488
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,900
Where does he get that?
Cos you don't draw and I don't draw.

489
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,400
I draw.

490
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,800
Yeah, but there's no way that
you could be the actual father.

491
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,200
I'm hoping you'll take Willie on the 16th
cos Connie and I want to go to Barbados.

492
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,800
Are you still gonna write that stupid book?
I mean, are you serious about that?

493
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,500
I'm very serious about it. It's an honest
book. You have nothing to be ashamed of.

494
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,500
- Excuse me.
- Can I talk to you a minute? Excuse me.

495
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,000
Here's what I still don't understand.
Where are you running?

496
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,100
I can't understand
how you can prefer her to me.

497
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
- You can't understand?
- No.

498
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,000
You knew my history!

499
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,500
I know. My analyst warned me, but you
were so beautiful I got another analyst.

500
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,900
- D'you think we can be ever just friends?
- You're putting in all the details?

501
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,100
No, not the part where
you tried to run her over with the car.

502
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,600
Wha... I tried to run her over with a car?

503
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,300
What are you talking about?
It was late. You know I don't drive well.

504
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,400
It was raining. It was dark.

505
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,800
Why were you lurking outside the cabin?

506
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,500
I was spying on you guys cos I knew what
was happening. You were falling in love.

507
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,200
So you felt you had to
run her over with the car?

508
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,100
Do I look like that type of person?
You know how slowly I was going?

509
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Not slowly enough
that you didn't rip the front porch off.

510
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Get the kid. I can't... I can't have
this argument every time I come over.

511
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,700
- You look funny in that jacket.
- I know.

512
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,400
I had hoped for something
in the gabardine.

513
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,100
- So, do you miss me?
- Yeah. Do you miss me?

514
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,100
Of course I miss you. I love you. That's
why I come and get you all the time.

515
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,500
- Why can't we have frankfurters?
- Because this is a Russian tearoom.

516
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,000
I mean, you wanna have a blintz or
something. Frankfurter gives you cancer.

517
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,300
Besides, you see those two women here?
They have very beautiful women here.

518
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,400
We could do well. I think we could have
picked up these two, if you were quicker.

519
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,500
I'm serious.

520
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,500
I think the brunette liked you.

521
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,700
I think I should, uh...
No, I'll call him.

522
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Hello, Yale? I'm sorry for calling.

523
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,700
Well, no, no, nothing's wrong. I...

524
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,200
Well, I just thought that it's Sunday out

525
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:37,000
and maybe if you could get away,
we could go for a walk or...

526
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,500
Oh, that's right. You mentioned that.
Well, OK, it was just a shot. Yeah. Yeah.

527
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,700
Well, I won't keep you. OK. Bye-bye.

528
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,500
Hello?

529
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,800
Oh, hi! Hi, how you doin'?

530
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,600
No, not at all. I was just sitting around
looking through the magazine section.

531
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,500
Uh, no, no, I didn't read the piece
on China's faceless masses.

532
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,000
I was checking out the lingerie ads.

533
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,300
Yeah, I can never get past them.
They're really erotic.

534
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
You wanna go for a walk?

535
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,700
I don't know, I've gotta get out. I'm going
stir-crazy and Yale's with Emily's parents.

536
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,000
It's such a beautiful Sunday.

537
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,700
It's an electrical storm.
You wanna wind up in an ashtray?

538
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,400
- It was such a beautiful day out.
- Yeah, wonderful.

539
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,700
I think the Chrysler Building blew up.

540
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,800
- Oh, no! Thunder scares me.
- It's not my favourite sound either.

541
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,600
D'you know every year one or two people
get killed during a storm in Central Park?

542
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,200
Why don't I run up ahead
and we'll talk later?

543
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,800
Jesus Christ, I'm soaking wet.
This is awful!

544
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,900
You look ridiculous! You know that?

545
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,800
Next time you want someone
to walk with you, get somebody else.

546
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,600
I've never seen anybody
react so strongly to a little bit of water.

547
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,300
It wasn't the water. It was the electricity.

548
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,800
I'll turn into a guy that sells
comics outside Bloomingdale's.

549
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,300
What do you think?
You think I look terrible? How do I look?

550
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,000
- I can't see.
- You should see your face!

551
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,500
You look kinda nice, actually.
You're sort of pretty.

552
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,400
- I'm really annoyed with Yale.
- Why?

553
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,400
He was supposed to see me today
and then he couldn't.

554
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,700
And I had tickets to this Vivaldi concert.
He had to cancel on me, of course.

555
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,500
- That's what happens when...
- I know. You're having an affair.

556
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,400
- What a terrible way to put it.
- Hey, I didn't put it that way.

557
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,300
My husband, well, my ex-husband,
had an affair when we were married.

558
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,100
- Really?
- Yeah. At least one that I know of.

559
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,600
And I never mentioned anything because
I felt that I was deficient in some way.

560
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,900
That I was bad in bed, not bright enough,
or physically unattractive.

561
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
- But in the end he was just a louse.
- Yeah, I know. An intellectual louse.

562
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,200
Oh, God, was he brilliant.
I was so crazy about him.

563
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,400
Really opened me up sexually.
Taught me everything.

564
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Women found him devastating.

565
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,800
Oh, look. There's Saturn.

566
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,400
Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun.

567
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,600
How many of the satellites of Saturn
can you name?

568
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,700
There's Mimas, Titan, Dione.
Hyperion, of course.

569
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,900
I can't name any of 'em and fortunately
they never come up in conversation.

570
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,100
I can't name any of 'em and fortunately
they never come up in conversation.

571
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,800
Facts.
I got a million facts at my fingertips.

572
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,800
They mean nothing cos nothing worth
knowing is understood with the mind.

573
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,100
Everything valuable enters
through a different opening,

574
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,700
if you'll forgive the disgusting imagery.

575
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,600
I don't agree at all. Where would we be
without rational thought?

576
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,900
You... you... you rely too much
on your brain.

577
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,900
The brain is the most overrated organ.

578
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,600
I know. You probably think
I'm too cerebral.

579
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,100
Well, you are, you know,
kind of on the brainy side.

580
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,300
What's the difference what I think about
you? God knows what you think of me.

581
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,300
You're fine. Are you kidding?

582
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,600
You do have a tendency to get
a little hostile, but I find that attractive.

583
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,100
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm glad you do.

584
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,800
So, you think I have no feelings?
Is that it?

585
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,500
Hey, wha... You're so sensitive, Jesus!
I never said that.

586
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,100
I think you're... I think you're terrific.

587
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,400
Really, you know. I... I...
You're very insecure.

588
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,100
I think you're wonderful, really.

589
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,800
What do you think?
It's probably stopped raining out.

590
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,600
You wanna grab a bite
or something like that?

591
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I gotta see somebody this evening.
I don't know if it's a great idea.

592
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,800
Right. Well...
So what about sometime next week?

593
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,100
I might give you a call,
if you have any free time?

594
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm... I'm not gonna have any free time
cos... I don't think it's such a great idea.

595
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:20,400
I'm working on this book and it,
you know, takes a lot of my energy up.

596
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,300
OK. OK.

597
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,300
Your parents were in a good mood.
I almost had a good time.

598
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,900
- Who did you call after dinner?
- Oh, uh, David Cohen.

599
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,600
He wants me to review the new book
on Virginia Woolf.

600
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,500
Written another one, if you can believe it.

601
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,400
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. What do you mean?

602
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,400
- You seem sort of nervous.
- No, I'm not. I feel good.

603
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,100
- I was gonna ask you how you felt.
- No. I'm OK.

604
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,800
- You seemed strange at dinner.
- Ah, just more thoughts about kids.

605
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Oh, come on.

606
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,800
Listen, I told Cohen I'd stop by and
pick up the book. Is that OK with you?

607
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,700
Yeah.

608
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,400
It's not too crowded.

609
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,100
No, not bad for Sunday.
I thought it'd be jammed.

610
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,700
Gee, I'm glad you could get out tonight
cos... I really did wanna see you a lot.

611
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,500
I like it when you get
an uncontrollable urge.

612
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,700
Yeah, I know, it's my best feature.

613
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,900
My boyish impetuosity.
It's my... You look adorable.

614
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,100
My boyish impetuosity.
It's my... You look adorable.

615
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
So I have a chance to go to London,

616
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
study with the Academy
of Music and Dramatic Arts.

617
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,600
- Really? When did this happen?
- The other day. Got a letter in the mail.

618
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,800
Well, that's great. That's terrific.

619
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,600
But I don't wanna go without you.

620
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,400
Hey, I can't go to London and study.

621
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,300
Especially Shakespeare.
You know, I don't look good in leotards.

622
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,400
- I'm serious.
- Of course you should go. It's great.

623
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,100
You'll have a great time.

624
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,700
It's a great town and you're a wonderful
actress and it's a terrific place to study.

625
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,500
You'll be the toast of the town.
You'll have a good time, really.

626
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,300
- You shouldn't pass that...
- So what happens to us?

627
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,500
Well, you know, we'll always have Paris.

628
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm kidding.

629
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,800
What kind of question is that?
You can't think of that now.

630
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,700
You won't take me seriously
just because I'm 17.

631
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,900
Yeah, exactly, because you're 17.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

632
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,100
Yeah, exactly, because you're 17.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

633
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,700
You're 17 now. When you're 36, I'll be...

634
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,600
63.

635
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,000
63, right. Thank you.

636
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,100
You know, it's absurd. You'll be
at the height of your sexual powers.

637
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,500
Of course, I will too probably, but,

638
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,700
you know, I'm a late starter.

639
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,900
- Who ordered the plain pie?
- Me.

640
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,900
So you must be anchovies,
sausage, mushrooms, peppers.

641
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,000
Forgot the coconut.

642
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:56,400
So what do you wanna do tonight? We'll
go to the movies, I'll take you dancing...

643
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,900
- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.

644
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,000
OK, I know what we can do.

645
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:09,100
- Well, get the filthy look off your face.
- Shut up. It's not filthy.

646
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,700
This is so corny. I can't believe this.
Is this what you wanted to do?

647
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,400
I don't think it's corny.
I think it's fun!

648
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,300
It is fun, but I did this
when I was a kid, you know.

649
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,200
Well, I've never done it. I think it's great.

650
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,600
On my prom night I went
around this park five times, six times.

651
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:46,700
If I had been with a girl, this would
have been an incredible experience.

652
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,500
Quit fighting it.
You know you're crazy about me.

653
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,100
I am. You're... You're God's answer to Job.

654
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,100
You would have ended
all argument between them.

655
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,400
He'd have said "I do a lot of terrible things
but I can also make one of these."

656
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,100
And Job would've said "OK, you win."

657
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,000
Look, this is crazy. I just can't do this
any more. It's really bullshit!

658
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,500
You're married and
I expected to see you this weekend

659
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,000
and I sit around like I've nothing to do,
so I called Isaac. We went for a walk.

660
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,600
- It was just lucky he was free.
- I know. I'm sorry.

661
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,900
Oh, it's not your fault.
What the hell. It's a no- win situation.

662
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,200
It's just I'm beautiful and I'm bright
and I deserve better!

663
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,600
I know.

664
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,700
- What if I took some action?
- No!

665
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,800
I'm not a home wrecker.

666
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,400
I don't know how I got into this.
I guess we met at the wrong time.

667
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,500
It happens. Hello?

668
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Harvey. How are you?

669
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,700
What?

670
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,200
Well... why don't you bring it by
on Thursday and I'll read it then, OK?

671
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.
Right, I'll talk to you later. OK, bye-bye.

672
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,000
- What d'you want me to do?
- Waffles. Nothing. It's just...

673
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,600
Waffles! Will you stop that now?
We're just going no place. Excuse me.

674
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,800
Look, I know it's terrible. I'm at Sneedon's
Landing with Emily and her parents

675
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,500
and I love her!
And I'm thinking about you all the time.

676
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,200
I don't wa... Christ. I don't wanna hear it.

677
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm from Philadelphia.
My family's never had affairs.

678
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,200
My parents have been married 43 years.
Nobody cheats at all. Hello?

679
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,900
Oh, Donny. Hi! It's my analyst.

680
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,800
Hello.

681
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,100
No...
Well, I think that'd be impossible.

682
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,000
OK, well, probably later in the week.
OK, all right.

683
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,800
I'll get back to you. OK, bye.

684
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,300
Oh, man. Waffles!

685
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Please, just don't. This is really
a bad time... Waffles! ...a bad time for me.

686
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,600
I gotta think things through here.

687
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,100
- Obviously I shouldn't have come here.
- Well, no, probably not.

688
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,300
Listen to that! How am I gonna...?

689
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,400
What is that sound? Can you hear that?
Listen. Where's it coming from?

690
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,700
It's like somebody's playing the trumpet.

691
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,900
Or somebody sawing... Like a man
sawing a trumpet in half. Right? Right?

692
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,200
- Let's fool around.
- You hear it?

693
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,200
It'll take your mind off it.

694
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,100
How many times a night...? How often
can you make love in an evening?

695
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,000
- Well, a lot.
- Yeah, I can tell. A lot. That's...

696
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,400
Well, a lot is my favourite number.
Gee, really? Can you?

697
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,700
Let's do it some strange way
you've always wanted to do,

698
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,800
but nobody would do with you.

699
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,300
I'm shocked. What kind of talk is that
from a kid your age?

700
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,600
I'll get my scuba-diving equipment
and really show you...

701
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,900
- Take me seriously!
- I do take you seriously, but...

702
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,400
Listen to this. Am I crazy? Wha...? Ah!

703
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,400
It's a rumbling. Listen to that goddamn...
Where the hell is that coming from?

704
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,400
- It's probably just the elevator shaft.
- It's not. It's coming from the walls.

705
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,100
Let's... Let's... Can we check into a hotel?

706
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,200
- Oh, you're crazy!
- I can't sleep here. I can't.

707
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,600
Where's the aspirin? What d'you do...

708
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,700
I can help you fix this place up,
if you give me a chance.

709
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,200
No, and I don't want you living here.

710
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,200
Tonight is a special occasion.
It's my first night in the apartment,

711
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,200
so I wanted to break in the place
and I was afraid to sleep alone.

712
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,400
Hey, what is this?
There's brown water!

713
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,800
- The pipes are rusty.
- What is this, Tracy?

714
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,600
- The pipes are rusty.
- Look at this. It's brown water.

715
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,400
I'm paying $700 a month.
I got rats with bongos and a frog.

716
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,500
And I got brown water here.

717
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,700
- Look. It's disgusting.
- What's gonna happen to us?

718
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,500
Listen. You keep ignoring me.
What's gonna happen with us?

719
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,300
What do you mean?
D'you have a good time with me?

720
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,300
- Aren't I a load of laughs and fun?
- Yes.

721
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,700
So, and that's it, and we have fun.

722
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,100
Then you're gonna go to London
exactly as we discussed it.

723
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,900
You're gonna take advantage of that
opportunity and study acting over there.

724
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,100
And you'll think of me always
as a fond memory. It'll be nice.

725
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,000
You know we have to
stop seeing each other?

726
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,400
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

727
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,800
I understand. I could tell by
the sound of your voice over the phone.

728
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,100
Very authoritative, you know.
Like the Pope or the computer in 2001.

729
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,100
It's not fair to you
and I don't know what I'm doing.

730
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,700
- Right.
- I mean... Come on, don't be angry.

731
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,300
You brought this up. You're not happy
the way things are going.

732
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,400
I'm not angry. It's just I knew it was gonna
end, but now it's happened I'm upset, OK?

733
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,900
Look, you don't wanna
make a commitment.

734
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,600
And I don't wanna break up my marriage
and then find out we're no good together.

735
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,000
I've gotta start thinking about Emily.

736
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:40,100
OK, you made your point very clear. I'm
just glad one of us had the nerve to end it.

737
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,700
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah...

738
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,400
Of course I will. What d'you think
I'm gonna do? Hang myself?

739
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,000
I'm a beautiful woman.
I'm young, highly intelligent.

740
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,600
I got everything going for me. The point...

741
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,100
The point is that... I don't know,
I'm all fucked up. I'm just... Shit!

742
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:03,000
What am I doing in this relationship
anyway? My phone never stops ringing.

743
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,900
I could go to bed with the entire faculty
of MIT, if I wanted to. It's just...

744
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,500
I don't know. I'm wasting myself
on a married man, so I don't know.

745
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,300
Listen, I think I'd better go now.
I just want you to have this.

746
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,300
- I got these tickets to see Rampal tonight.
- Oh, Mary. This is very hard on me, too.

747
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,900
Please! Just take them
and go with your wife.

748
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,100
Mary, you love Rampal.
Call somebody up. Take Isaac.

749
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Fuck off, Yale!

750
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,700
I know you're gonna think the water's
a little brown, but you can drink it.

751
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,800
Don't get thrown by this.

752
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,000
- I'm really sorry for bothering you.
- No problem.

753
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:48,300
- It's just... God, this is brown, isn't it?
- It is, but you get used to it after a while.

754
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,200
I didn't know who to call.

755
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,700
I don't think you should take Valium.
It causes cancer.

756
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,100
- No. Half a Valium?
- Yeah, abdominal cancer, I think.

757
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,200
When did they find that out?

758
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,400
That's just my theory, but I think
it's correct. I got tissues someplace.

759
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,700
- Well, I guess I deserve everything I get.
- Come on.

760
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,900
It's true. It's really true. I mean,
I knew it couldn't possibly work out.

761
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,100
It's true. It's really true. I mean,
I knew it couldn't possibly work out.

762
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah, you pick a married guy

763
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,000
and when it doesn't work out,
it confirms your worst feelings.

764
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,100
What worst feelings?

765
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,300
You know. Your feelings about men
and marriage and that nothing works.

766
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh, please, don't psychoanalyse me.
I pay a doctor for that.

767
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,300
Hey. You call that guy
that you talk to a doctor?

768
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,300
You don't get suspicious when he calls
you at 3am and weeps into the telephone?

769
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,200
So he's unorthodox.
He's a highly qualified doctor.

770
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,700
He's done a great job on you. Your
self-esteem is like a notch below Kafka's.

771
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,900
What is that noise?

772
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,500
Yeah. Incredible, isn't it? There's a guy
upstairs. I don't know what the hell it is.

773
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,600
It's like he's up there strangling a parrot
or something. I can't stand it.

774
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,100
- How can you stand it? It's terrible.
- I know. I used to have a great apartment.

775
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,600
- Wanna go for a walk? It's quieter out.
- No, I think I'll just go home.

776
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,700
No, come on.

777
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,100
He led me on! That's the point of it.
Why am I reluctant to criticise him?

778
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,300
He led me on! That's the point of it.
Why am I reluctant to criticise him?

779
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,500
Relax. Yale would not do that.
He's not that kind of a guy.

780
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,700
Don't defend him.
You guys all stick up for each other.

781
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,800
Yale has his problems as we all do.
I'm starting to sound like Rabbi Blitzstein.

782
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,300
Well, thanks for letting me come over.
I appreciate it. It's very nice of you.

783
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,900
Well, thanks for letting me come over.
I appreciate it. It's very nice of you.

784
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,300
Tracy and I are going out tonight,
if you wanna come along.

785
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,900
Oh, no, I'll be fine. I'll be OK.

786
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

787
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,200
- That's a healthy piece of towel paper.
- Oh, gee. God!

788
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,300
Well, goodbye. Thanks a lot.

789
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,400
But my point is a cab driver
doesn't make enough money...

790
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,800
Oh, look at that... that guy's toupee.
That's unbelievable.

791
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:00,000
That is hilarious. There's a... a...
an inch of cheesecloth. You can see it.

792
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,600
I don't know why, you know,
his loved ones don't tell him.

793
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:08,300
It's like the toupee dropped on his head
from a window ledge as he was walking.

794
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,900
But look at his wife. Looks like her face
has been lifted about 8,000 times.

795
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,800
I know. It's so plastic. It's so tight.

796
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,700
I hate that. I just hate that. I wish...

797
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,800
Why can't they just age naturally
instead of putting all that junk on?

798
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,600
I know. Old faces are... are nice.

799
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,800
Yeah. They're great.

800
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,500
Hey, be careful. I think
I got black bean sauce in the bed.

801
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,000
Oh, look. It's great.
The late show's a WC Fields film.

802
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,500
Oh, great. We gotta watch that.

803
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,100
Oh, God.

804
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,500
Boy, I really feel good, you know.
I got my life together finally.

805
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,900
Yeah?

806
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,200
You know, I just had to cut this thing off
finally. I'm not the type for affairs.

807
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:04,200
- D'you ever hear from Mary, or see her?
- No. We just cut it off. It's easier that way.

808
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,000
She's terrific. She deserves more
than a fling with a married guy.

809
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:13,100
- Yeah, she's screwed up, but great.
- Right up your alley. You oughta call her.

810
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,500
- I... I should call her?
- Yeah.

811
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,300
- Why should I call her?
- Because she likes you.

812
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,300
She told me she did.

813
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,000
- You're crazy.
- No. She said she finds you attractive.

814
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
- She said she found me attractive?
- Yeah.

815
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,600
- When was this?
- She said it when she first met you.

816
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,400
- I didn't know. I can't.
- Sorry about that.

817
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
I always think of you guys together

818
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,300
It's over. Unless you're serious
about Tracy. Are you?

819
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,500
- No. Tracy's too young.
- Then call her up.

820
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,700
Listen, she's an unhappy person.
I mean, she needs something in her life.

821
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,100
- I think you guys would be good together.
- I could be a good influence on her.

822
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,400
I think that under my personal vibrations,
I could put her life in a kind of good order.

823
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,000
That's what you said about Jill, and she
went from bisexuality to homosexuality.

824
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,300
Yeah, but I gave it
the old college try there for a while.

825
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,100
- Listen, you should call her up.
- No kidding. What did she say about me?

826
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,900
She said that she likes you very much.
She thinks you're smart.

827
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,700
- She thinks you're...
- Keep going. Don't stop.

828
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,100
- Attractive.
- Really? No kidding.

829
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,800
You see, to me a great movie
is with WC Fields. That's what I like.

830
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,800
Or Grand Illusion. That's... I see that every
time it's on television, if I'm aware of it.

831
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,800
So what you got to eat here? Nothing.

832
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,300
Oh, Jesus, what is this? You got a corned
beef sandwich here from 19517, I think.

833
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,200
- Look at this. I mean...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

834
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,800
- I don't have time to cook.
- Corned beef should not be blue.

835
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,200
It's really terrible.

836
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,800
- Hey.
- What?

837
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,300
Come here.

838
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,400
What're you doing?

839
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,500
What am I doing? You have to ask?
I was kissing you flush on the mouth.

840
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,700
I... I cannot get my life
in any kind of order. It's just...

841
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,900
- It's something I wanted to do for ages.
- Yeah, I know.

842
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,800
Do you? Cos I... I thought I was hiding it.
I was trying to be real cool and casual.

843
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,600
I thought you wanted to kiss me
at the planetarium.

844
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,700
- I did.
- I thought so.

845
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:43,300
But you were going out with Yale then and
I would never in a million years interfere...

846
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,400
Did you want me to kiss you?

847
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:49,300
I don't know what I wanted.
I was so angry at Yale that day.

848
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,100
But you were so sexy.
You were soaking wet from the rain

849
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
and I had a mad impulse
to throw you down on the lunar surface

850
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,200
and commit
interstellar perversion with you.

851
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:05,100
I can't go from relationship to
relationship. It's senseless. I can't do it.

852
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,700
Well, what... Are you still
hung up on Yale? Is that the problem?

853
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,800
I've got too many problems.

854
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,100
I'm really not the person
to get involved with. I'm trouble.

855
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,200
- Hey, honey, Trouble is my middle name.
- What are you saying?

856
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,000
Actually, my middle name is Mortimer.

857
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,900
I'm... I'm kidding.

858
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,000
My problem is I'm both attracted
and repelled by the male organ.

859
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,000
So it doesn't make for
good relationships with men.

860
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,500
What about your relationships
with women?

861
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,800
You never really told me much
about your first wife.

862
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,400
My first wife was
a kindergarten teacher, you know.

863
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,800
She got into drugs
and she... moved to San Francisco.

864
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,000
Went into est, became a Moonie.

865
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,600
She's with
the William Morris Agency now.

866
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,000
D'you like that?

867
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,300
This... this, I think, has a kind of
wonderful otherness to it, you know.

868
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,100
- A marvellous negative capability.
- OK.

869
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,100
Kind of wonderful energy to it,
don't you think?

870
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,100
I thought that wine
was wonderful, didn't you think?

871
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And it just made my face
all flushed and hot.

872
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:23,700
Yeah. You look so beautiful
I can hardly keep my eyes on the meter.

873
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,400
It's 14 bucks!

874
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,600
I know, but it was a great restaurant.
Didn't you love it?

875
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,200
Yeah, I love seafood. Course I'm drunk.
I don't know if you can tell or not.

876
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,400
Hey, you know, it was the only time
in my life I ever had Chianti from Warsaw.

877
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,600
Hey, you know, it was the only time
in my life I ever had Chianti from Warsaw.

878
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,300
- Give me a kiss.
- OK.

879
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,500
What are you thinking?

880
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,100
I was thinking there must be
something wrong with me

881
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,800
because I've never had a relationship

882
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,800
that's lasted longer than
the one between Hitler and Eva Braun.

883
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,800
I think you're still drunk!

884
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,800
It's great. It's... it's...

885
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:50,100
I don't play the harmonica, but it's
an incredible... harmonica is what it is.

886
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:55,400
Well, you said you wanted to learn.
I'm trying to open up that side of you.

887
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,600
Tracy, you're throwing away
an enormous amount of real affection

888
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,700
on the wrong person.

889
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,900
It's not wrong for me.

890
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,500
Listen, I don't... I don't think
we should keep seeing each other.

891
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,500
Why not?

892
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,300
Because I think you're getting
too hung up on me, you know?

893
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,800
"Hung up on me."
I'm starting to sound like you.

894
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,400
I'm not hung up on you.
I'm in love with you.

895
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,200
You can't be in love with me.
We've been over this.

896
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,200
You're a kid. You don't know what
love means. I don't know what it means.

897
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,400
Nobody knows what the hell's going on.

898
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,200
We have laughs together.
I care about you.

899
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,500
Your concerns are my concerns.
We have great sex.

900
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,500
You... But you're 17 years old.

901
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,400
By the time you're 21,
you'll have a dozen relationships,

902
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,100
believe me,
far more passionate than this one.

903
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,500
Well, don't you love me?

904
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,300
The truth is that I love somebody else.

905
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,600
You do?

906
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,600
Hey, come on... We... we...

907
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,100
This was supposed to be
a temporary fling. You know that.

908
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,300
You met someone?

909
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,000
Don't stare at me with those big eyes.

910
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:19,100
You look like one of those barefoot kids
from Bolivia who needs foster parents.

911
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,200
Have you been seeing someone?

912
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,600
No. Yes. Someone older.

913
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,100
I mean, y-y-you know, y-y-you know.

914
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,000
Not as old as I am,
but in the same general ballpark as me.

915
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Gee, now I don't feel so good.

916
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,600
It's not right. You shouldn't get hung...

917
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,600
I mean, you should open up your life.

918
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,800
You know, you've got to.

919
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,600
You state it like it's to my advantage,
when it's you that wants to get out of it.

920
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,700
Hey, don't be so precocious, OK?
I mean, don't be so smart.

921
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,400
I'm 42. My hair's falling out. I'm starting
to lose some hearing in my right ear.

922
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,900
Is that what you want?

923
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:03,400
I can't believe that you met somebody
that you like better than me.

924
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,200
Why should I feel guilty about this?

925
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,200
I've always encouraged you
to go out with guys more your own age.

926
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:14,800
Kids from your class.
Billy and Biff and Scooter.

927
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,500
And, you know, little Tommy or Terry.

928
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,000
Hey, come on, don't cry.

929
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,400
Don't cry.

930
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,400
Come on, don't cry.

931
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,600
Tracy... Tracy, don't...
Come on. Don't cry, Tracy.

932
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,900
- Tracy...
- Just leave me alone.

933
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,100
Tracy, come on, don't...

934
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,300
Leave me alone.

935
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,500
- That was wonderful.
- I'll say.

936
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,800
- I love being in the country.
- It's very relaxing.

937
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:52,100
The mosquitoes have sucked all the blood
out of my left leg. Apart from that...

938
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,400
- Doesn't it make you feel better?
- Yeah, you were dynamite,

939
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,800
except I felt for about
two seconds you were faking.

940
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,300
- Not a lot.
- No.

941
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,100
Yes. When you dug your nails
into my neck, you were a little...

942
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,700
Well, I guess I'm nervous around you.

943
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,200
- Still?
- Well, yeah.

944
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,300
- So crazy.
- Because I'd like everything to work out.

945
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:16,700
It will. You should leave everything to me.
I'll make everything happen.

946
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,600
D'you really promise?

947
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,500
Because I like you.
I feel good around you.

948
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,200
I don't blame you.

949
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:28,300
Yeah, I mean... Yale was great, he was
absolutely great, but he was married.

950
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,500
And Jeremiah, my ex-husband.

951
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,600
He was just this oversexed,
brilliant kind of animal.

952
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,600
- Hey, what am I? Grandma Moses?
- Not at all. No, no, no.

953
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,300
- You're much different.
- Yeah?

954
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,100
Yes. You're someone
I could imagine having children with.

955
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,400
- Really?
- Yeah.

956
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,900
Hit the lights. Go ahead. Turn 'em out.

957
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,700
We'll trade fours.

958
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,700
Well, we never see you any more.

959
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,400
Cos I'm working on my book.
I'm submerged.

960
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,200
- It's that girl. Serious, isn't it?
- Well, serious, you know.

961
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:03,100
When are we gonna get to meet her?
I'm sure Yale'd like to meet her.

962
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,000
We should go out sometime.

963
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,500
I don't understand. Why does he
need a car? A sudden urge.

964
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,400
He just wants it.

965
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,700
What...? Is there nothing I can do
to dissuade you from this?

966
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,600
What...? Is there nothing I can do
to dissuade you from this?

967
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:19,800
It's so crazy. They should ban all cars
from Manhattan. I mean, this is crazy.

968
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,900
Listen, Emily wants to know
why I never bring Mary around.

969
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,000
Why not bring Mary around?

970
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,200
- I don't know. Is it awkward for you?
- Are you kidding?

971
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,900
I spoke to her. It's no problem for her.

972
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,800
- Then why not?
- Well, you know.

973
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:38,000
Hey, don't get this thing. I hate cars.
It screws up the environment.

974
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,300
- This is a work of art.
- Yeah.

975
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

976
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,900
- This is Emily.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

977
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,200
- This is Emily.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

978
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,100
- This is Yale.
- Hi, Yale.

979
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,900
So, shall we go?

980
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,900
- Yeah, let's go.
- Sure.

981
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,600
Look at that.
That building is almost torn down.

982
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,800
Can't they have those things
declared landmarks?

983
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,900
Yeah, I once tried to block demolition.

984
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:52,500
Getting some people to lay in front of a
building, and a cop stepped on my hand.

985
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,800
The city's really changing.

986
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:00,200
I need something for round the house
that doesn't make me look too Mexican.

987
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,800
Ugh, this is...

988
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,300
- Mary?
- Oh, my God. Jeremiah. Well...

989
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,300
Hi.

990
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:11,900
- Jeremiah, this is my friend Isaac Davis.
- Hi. Glad to meet you.

991
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,200
- God, this is incredible.
- Incredible.

992
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,800
I'm in town for a few days.
There's a symposium on semantics.

993
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,100
- Well...
- And you're looking so great. I just, uh...

994
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,800
- You. You're so thin. You lost weight.
- Well, I have an exercise machine.

995
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,400
Well, you really look good. Really good.

996
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,400
God. Well, I'm a bit late,
but it's just so nice seeing you.

997
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,700
- It's great seeing you.
- I read an article by you

998
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,800
- On Brecht.
- Oh, shit! I know.

999
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:42,000
I always was a sucker
for Germanic theatre.

1000
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,900
- Well...
- God.

1001
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,300
- OK. Well, God... OK. So long.
- Bye. Bye, Jeremiah.

1002
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,100
Bye. Bye.

1003
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,100
God, what a surprise.
I cannot get over it. My ex-husband.

1004
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,400
And he really does look a lot thinner.
He looks great.

1005
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,600
You certainly fooled me. I was shocked
cos that's not what I expected.

1006
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,800
You certainly fooled me. I was shocked
cos that's not what I expected.

1007
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,300
- What did you expect?
- I don't know. You had always led me to...

1008
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,000
You said he was a ladies' man,
that he opened you up sexually.

1009
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,700
- So? So?
- Then this little homunculus, you know...

1010
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,600
He's quite devastating.

1011
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,300
Really?

1012
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:24,000
Well, it's... it's amazing
how subjective all that stuff is.

1013
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,700
I don't know what you're...

1014
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,400
- Boy, you're really typing away.
- Yeah, it's a cinch.

1015
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,400
You still reviewing Tolstoy?

1016
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,200
No, no, I finished that two days ago.
I'm on that novelisation.

1017
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,000
What... what do you waste your time
with a novelisation for?

1018
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,700
Why? Because it's easy and it pays well.

1019
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:48,600
It's like another contemporary American
phenomenon that's truly moronic.

1020
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,700
The novelisations of movies.
You're much too brilliant for that.

1021
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,200
You should be doing other stuff.

1022
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,000
- Like what?
- Fiction. I've seen your fiction. It's terrific.

1023
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,500
Hello?

1024
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,800
Mary, hi. It's Yale.

1025
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,200
I was hoping you'd pick up.

1026
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,500
Listen, could we meet for coffee?

1027
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,000
Well, why? What is it?

1028
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:16,600
Well, you know, I miss you.
I just thought maybe we could talk.

1029
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:21,400
No, I don't think that would be possible.
I don't think that would be possible at all.

1030
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,900
I'm sorry, I just, uh...
No, I... I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1031
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,500
- Who was that?
- What?

1032
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,700
Who was that on the phone just now?

1033
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,600
- Uh, dance lessons.
- Dance lessons that was?!

1034
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,300
Yeah. Do we want free dance lessons?

1035
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:51,500
Right. They give you one free lesson,
then they hook you for $50,000 worth.

1036
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,600
Viking loved my book.
They loved the first four chapters

1037
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,400
and, you know,
they were really complimentary.

1038
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,300
Yale had read them
and thought they showed promise.

1039
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,200
But Yale's family,
so of course he's encouraging.

1040
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,500
But Viking will shell out the money.

1041
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,900
Maybe it'll inspire Yale to finish his book.
He's been talking about it long enough.

1042
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,800
Mary read the stuff and she was
laughing out loud. I respect her judgment.

1043
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,600
- Although she's doing a think piece on...
- Hello?

1044
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,300
Hey, where were you? You were
supposed to be home an hour ago.

1045
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,600
- Uh... I bought the car.
- Oh, no. You did?

1046
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:35,000
I know it's a meaningless extravagance,
but I had to have it.

1047
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
- That thing we saw?
- Yeah.

1048
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,800
Did you hear Viking Press loved
the first four chapters of lke's book?

1049
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,200
- Great!
- They were real complimentary.

1050
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,400
Next week I get the car
and we'll celebrate.

1051
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,200
- OK.
- In our new car.

1052
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,500
Jesus, listen to this.

1053
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,800
"Making love to this
deeper, more masterful female

1054
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,700
made me realise
what an empty experience,

1055
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,300
what a bizarre charade
sex with my husband was."

1056
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,200
Please. That is so nauseating. I...

1057
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,700
Is this true? Did you make love
with Jill and a woman?

1058
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,900
She put that in?

1059
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,500
Christ! She wanted to, I think.
I didn't wanna be a bad sport.

1060
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:08,000
- Did you have a good time?
- No, I didn't.

1061
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,400
Did you hear the one
where he tried to run her lover over?

1062
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,800
- Oh, yeah.
- Whose side are you on?

1063
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,700
I didn't try and run her over.
It was raining. The car lurched.

1064
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,700
Jesus, now everybody in town
is gonna know all these details.

1065
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,700
Jesus, now everybody in town
is gonna know all these details.

1066
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,200
Everybody... All my friends and...

1067
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:28,600
Listen. "He was given to
fits of rage, Jewish, liberal paranoia,

1068
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,600
male chauvinism,
self-righteous misanthropy,

1069
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,900
and nihilistic moods of despair."

1070
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,000
"He had complaints about life,
but never solutions."

1071
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,100
"He longed to be an artist,
but balked at the necessary sacrifices."

1072
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,200
"In his most private moments,
he spoke of his fear of death

1073
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:49,100
which he elevated to tragic heights
when, in fact, it was mere narcissism."

1074
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,900
- I came here to strangle you.
- Nothing I wrote was untrue.

1075
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,400
You make me out to be
Lee Harvey Oswald!

1076
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,200
It's an honest account.

1077
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,100
- That I'm narcissistic?
- You're self-obsessed.

1078
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,100
- Misanthropic and self-righteous?
- I wrote some nice things about you.

1079
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,000
Like what? What?

1080
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,200
You cry when you see
Gone With The Wind.

1081
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,300
What are you laughing about?

1082
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:15,300
- You let her write that garbage?
- Wait. This is between you two.

1083
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,200
D'you honestly think
that I tried to run you over?

1084
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,800
You just happened to hit the gas
as I walked in front of the car.

1085
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,100
- Did I do it on purpose?
- Well, what would Freud say?

1086
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,500
That I really wanted to run her over.
That's why he was a genius.

1087
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,400
Listen, I'm going upstairs.
I got work to do.

1088
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,100
Don't forget that Willie's at ballet class.

1089
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,300
Look, I better warn you.

1090
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,900
I've had some interest in this book
for a movie sale.

1091
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,400
Anybody home?

1092
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:50,300
Yeah? I got an unbelievable story
to tell you. Absolutely incredible. You OK?

1093
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,100
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1094
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,600
Just let me get one glass of brown water
cos I'm dying of thirst.

1095
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,000
- Isaac, I wanna talk to you first.
- Mm-mm. So I go over to Jill's today

1096
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:04,300
because I'm real annoyed over that junk
she printed in the book. And...

1097
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,400
Isaac, before you get wound up,
there's something I wanna tell you.

1098
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,600
- What's the matter? You look pale.
- Well...

1099
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,500
Wh... What's the matter?

1100
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,300
Hey, what... Is there something wrong?
What is it?

1101
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,100
I think I'm still in love with Yale.

1102
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,500
What?

1103
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,100
You... Are you kidd...?

1104
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,700
- You are?
- Yes.

1105
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,700
Well, when did this happen? What...

1106
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,300
Well, you are or you think you are?

1107
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,900
I started seeing him again.

1108
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,800
When? Since when?

1109
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:05,200
Just since today. I mean,
that's why I wanted to be open about it.

1110
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,500
Jesus, I'm... I'm shocked.

1111
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:13,100
I'm... I'm shocked. I'm surprised.

1112
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,600
I think I've always been in love with him.

1113
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,000
How does he feel about this?

1114
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,800
Well...

1115
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,500
He wants to move out of his place
so that we can live together.

1116
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:29,200
I'm stunned. I mean, I'm in a state of...

1117
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,500
Somebody should
throw a blanket over me. You know, I'm...

1118
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:36,800
Well, you see, he called me several times
in a very depressed state

1119
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,100
and he still loves me.

1120
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:44,000
This is shaping up like a Noel Coward
play. Somebody should go make martinis.

1121
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,500
I don't blame you
for being furious with me.

1122
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,600
I'm too stunned to be furious.

1123
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:53,200
Well, then I wish you would. I wish you'd
get angry so that we could have it out.

1124
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,800
I don't get angry. I tend to internalise.

1125
01:16:55,700 --> 01:17:00,500
I can't express anger. That's one of the
problems I have. I grow a tumour instead.

1126
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:05,500
Well, I told you that I was trouble from the
beginning, from when we started dating.

1127
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,700
So what does your analyst say?

1128
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,300
Donny's in a coma.
He had a very bad acid experience.

1129
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,000
Oh, that's gr... That's great.
I mean, you know...

1130
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,300
- I think you're making a big mistake here.
- Why?

1131
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,900
Why? Because you... Why?
Because you're preferring Yale to me.

1132
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:25,400
I know that sounds egotistical,
but... you know...

1133
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,200
This guy's been married 12 years.
What do you think will happen?

1134
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,100
He'll be away from her for a month,
he'll go crazy.

1135
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,400
And if he does commit to you, when
you start to feel secure, you'll drop him.

1136
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,400
I know it.
I give the whole thing... four weeks.

1137
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,200
I can't plan that far in advance.

1138
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,600
- You can't plan four weeks in advance?!
- No!

1139
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,300
What kind of foresight is that?

1140
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:52,600
Jesus. You know, I knew you were crazy
when we started going out.

1141
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,700
You always think that you're gonna be
the one that makes 'em act different, but...

1142
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,500
Isaac, I'm sorry.
I really am. I'm really sorry.

1143
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,900
Oh, well, I'm...

1144
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,400
I'm sorr... Where are you going?

1145
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,900
- I gotta get some air.
- Oh.

1146
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,800
What are you doing here?

1147
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,300
I spoke to Mary. Were you gonna tell me?

1148
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,500
- I was, but... I'm trying to teach a class.
- So where can we go and talk?

1149
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,600
- I was, but... I'm trying to teach a class.
- So where can we go and talk?

1150
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,800
- How'd you get past the security?
- I walked right past.

1151
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,200
What are you telling me?
That you're gonna leave Emily

1152
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,100
and run away with
the... the winner of the

1153
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,800
Zelda Fitzgerald
Emotional Maturity Award?

1154
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,800
Look, I love her.

1155
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,900
- What kind of crazy friend are you?
- A good friend. I introduced you two.

1156
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,800
- Why? What was the point?
- Cos I thought you liked her!

1157
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,500
- I do! Now we both like her!
- Yeah, well, I liked her first.

1158
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:24,800
"I liked her first."
What are you, six years old? Jesus!

1159
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,300
Look, would I have encouraged you
to take her out if I still liked her?

1160
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,700
So you liked her? Now you don't like her?

1161
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,400
It's early. You can change your mind
one more time before dinner.

1162
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,400
Don't get sarcastic about this.
You think I like this?

1163
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,700
How long were you gonna see her
without telling me?

1164
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,000
Don't turn this into
one of your big moral issues.

1165
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:49,200
You could've said, but you... All you had
to do was call me and talk to me.

1166
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,900
I'm understanding. I'd have said no,
but you'd have felt honest.

1167
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,700
I wanted to tell you about it.
I knew it would upset you. I...

1168
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,000
We had a few innocent meetings.

1169
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:04,400
A few? She said one. You guys should get
your story straight. Don't you rehearse?

1170
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,400
We met twice for coffee.

1171
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,600
Hey, she doesn't drink coffee.

1172
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:13,100
Did you meet for Sanka? That's not too
romantic. A little on the geriatric side.

1173
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,900
I'm not a saint, OK?

1174
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,500
You're too easy on yourself.
Don't you see?

1175
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,200
You're... You rationalise everything.
You're not honest with yourself.

1176
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,100
You talk about you wanna write a book,
but in the end you'd rather buy a Porsche.

1177
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,400
You cheat a little bit on Emily
and you play around the truth with me.

1178
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,100
The next thing you know you're in front
of a Senate committee naming names.

1179
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,600
You are so self-righteous.

1180
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:42,300
I mean, we're just people. We're just
human beings. You think you're God!

1181
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,400
I gotta model myself after someone.

1182
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,000
You just can't live the way you do.
It's all so perfect.

1183
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,500
Jesus, what are future generations
gonna say about us? My God!

1184
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,300
You know, someday
we're gonna be like him.

1185
01:20:55,300 --> 01:21:00,100
And he was probably one of the beautiful
people, dancing and playing tennis.

1186
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,700
And now look. This is what happens to us.

1187
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,600
You know, it's important
to have some kind of personal integrity.

1188
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:09,200
I'll be hanging in a classroom one day

1189
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:14,200
and I wanna make sure when I thin out
that I'm... well thought of.

1190
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,700
Ike!

1191
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,700
Isaac, where are you going?

1192
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:14,000
No, I knew Yale had affairs.

1193
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,000
But then, nothing's perfect.

1194
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:22,000
Marriage is a... requires
some minor compromises, I guess.

1195
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,100
It's funny cos I'm just a non-compromiser.

1196
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,200
I mean, I can't... I can't see that.

1197
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:34,000
I think it's always a mistake to look the
other way cos you pay for it in the end.

1198
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,400
But then you saw what Jill
wrote about me in that book.

1199
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,500
I'm living in the past.

1200
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,700
How about you? You seeing anybody?

1201
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:46,800
Yeah. You know, I... I never had any
problem meeting women. I mean, that's...

1202
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,000
But I was thinking about this
just about a week ago.

1203
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,800
I think, and I know this sounds strange,
but I think I really missed a good bet

1204
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,000
when I let Tracy go.

1205
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,300
- Remember Tracy?
- Yeah. I liked her.

1206
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,500
Yeah. I was thinking about this
at home last week

1207
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,300
and I think, of all the women
I've known over the last years,

1208
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:11,400
when I actually am honest with myself,
I think I had the most relaxed times

1209
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,000
and, you know, the nicest times with her.

1210
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,700
She was a terrific kid, but young, right?

1211
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,900
So that's that.

1212
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,900
Why don't you call her?

1213
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,900
No, I would never do that.
I think I blew that one.

1214
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,700
I kept her at a distance
and I would never give her a chance.

1215
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,700
And she was so sweet, you know.

1216
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,600
She called me. She left a message
with my service about a month ago

1217
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:41,800
that I should watch Grand Illusion
on television and I never returned her call.

1218
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,000
Cos I, you know, I didn't wanna
lead her on or anything.

1219
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,400
She really cared about me and I...

1220
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,000
You know I was a little pissed off at you.

1221
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,500
Me?

1222
01:23:52,700 --> 01:24:00,700
I figured if you hadn't introduced Mary
to Yale, this might never have happened.

1223
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:06,000
An idea for a short story
about, um, people in Manhattan

1224
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,800
who are constantly creating

1225
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:13,500
these real, unnecessary,
neurotic problems for themselves

1226
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:19,500
cos it keeps them from dealing with
more unsolvable, terrifying problems

1227
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,900
about... the universe.

1228
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,800
Let's...
Well, it has to be optimistic.

1229
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,700
Well, all right, why is life worth living?
That's a very good question.

1230
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,400
Well, there are certain things, I guess,
that make it worthwhile.

1231
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,900
Like what?

1232
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:46,900
OK... for me...

1233
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:54,300
Ooh, I would say Groucho Marx,
to name one thing.

1234
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,600
And Willie Mays.

1235
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:02,800
And... the second movement
of the Jupiter Symphony.

1236
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:10,800
And... Louis Armstrong's
recording of Potato Head Blues.

1237
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,800
Swedish movies, naturally.

1238
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,700
Sentimental Education by Flaubert.

1239
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,000
Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra.

1240
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:27,700
Those incredible
apples and pears by C?anne.

1241
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,700
The crabs at Sam Wo's.

1242
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,100
Tracy's face.

1243
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:20,800
Hi.

1244
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,400
I...

1245
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,700
What are you doing here?

1246
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:28,400
Well, I ran.

1247
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,700
I tried to call you on the phone,
but... it was busy

1248
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,700
so I knew that was two hours' worth of...

1249
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,600
So I couldn't get a taxi cab, so I ran.

1250
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,600
Where you going?

1251
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,400
London.

1252
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,100
You're going to London now?

1253
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:53,800
What d'you... What d'you mean? If I got
over here two minutes later, you'd be...

1254
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,800
...you'd be going to London?

1255
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:04,400
Well, let me get right to the point then.

1256
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,200
I don't think you oughta go.

1257
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,400
I think I made a big mistake.
and I would prefer it if you didn't go.

1258
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,400
Oh, Isaac.

1259
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:16,900
I mean it. I know it looks real bad now,
but, uh, you know, it...

1260
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Are you seeing anybody?
Are you going with anybody?

1261
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,400
No.

1262
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,500
So... well...

1263
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:28,600
D'you still love me,
or has that worn off or what?

1264
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,500
Jesus, you... pop up...

1265
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,400
You don't call me
and then you suddenly appear.

1266
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:40,900
I mean... What happened
to that woman you met?

1267
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:44,700
Well, I'll tell you,
I don't see her any more.

1268
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,400
I made a mistake.
What d'you want me to say?

1269
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,100
I don't think you oughta go to London.

1270
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,000
Well, I have to go.

1271
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,000
I mean, all the plans have been made,
arrangements.

1272
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:06,500
I mean, my parents are there now
looking for a place for me to live.

1273
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,400
Well...

1274
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,400
Do you still love me or what?

1275
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,900
Do you love me?

1276
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,200
Well, yeah, that's what... Of course.

1277
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,800
That's what this is all about, you know.

1278
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,900
- Guess what? I turned 18 the other day.
- Did you?

1279
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,000
I'm legal, but I'm still a kid.

1280
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:29,300
You're not such a kid. 18 years old.

1281
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:32,500
They could draft you.
In some countries you'd be...

1282
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,600
- You look good.
- You really hurt me.

1283
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,900
It was not on purpose, you know.

1284
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,300
I mean, I...
You know, it was... I mean...

1285
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:48,300
It was just the way
I was looking at things then.

1286
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,900
Well, I'll be back in six months.

1287
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:53,300
Six months! Are you kidding?

1288
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,200
Six months you're gonna go for?

1289
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:03,000
We've gone this long. I mean, what's
six months if we still love each other?

1290
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,100
Hey, don't be so mature, OK?

1291
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,900
I mean, six months is a long time.
Six months!

1292
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:13,900
You're gonna be in the thea... working
in the theatre with actors and directors.

1293
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:17,800
You know, you go to rehearsal
and you hang out with those people.

1294
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,700
You have lunch a lot and before you know
it attachments form and... you know...

1295
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,000
I mean, you don't wanna get into that...
You'll change.

1296
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:30,700
In six months you'll be
a completely different person.

1297
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,900
Well, don't you want me
to have that experience?

1298
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,300
I mean, a while ago
you made such a convincing case.

1299
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:42,600
Yeah, of course I do, but, you know...

1300
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:50,700
I mean, I just don't want that thing
about you that I like to change.

1301
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,600
I've gotta make a plane.

1302
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,400
Come on, you don't... Come on.

1303
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,300
You don't... You don't have to go.

1304
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,500
Why couldn't you have
brought this up last week?

1305
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,500
Six months isn't so long.

1306
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,800
Not everybody gets corrupted.

1307
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:18,300
You have to have a little faith in people
