1
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:20,905
Mom, who's the naked clown
in our bathroom?

2
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,914
What?

3
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,575
What is it, honey?

4
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,280
- What the hell you doing, kid?
- I had to go to the bathroom.

5
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,619
On my head?

6
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:37,186
Hey, buddy, this is my bathroom,
not your bedroom, you big drunken mess.

7
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,026
Billy!

8
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,728
Come on, sweetheart. Come on.

9
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:47,967
Let's give your mother's new boyfriend
a chance to collect his thoughts.

10
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,366
Ooh, boy.

11
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,743
What a morning.

12
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:34,119
Hey, kid, I'm sorry I went and freaked
out on you like that in the bathroom.

13
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,677
It's okay.

14
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,559
Would you like to see
a magic trick?

15
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,390
No.

16
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,624
Yeah, me neither.

17
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,425
Here.

18
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,528
Why don't you go out and buy yourself
something real nice, huh?

19
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:57,633
Thanks, Elvis.
This'll go a long way in the toy store.

20
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,838
- That's a cute kid you got there.
- Thanks.

21
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,438
Is that clock right?

22
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,948
Yeah.

23
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,281
Oh, shit!

24
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,786
Well, what's wrong?

25
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,415
I was supposed to be
at a birthday party.

26
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,254
Can I help you?

27
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,784
Last night when I got here,
I had a wig.

28
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,934
This one?

29
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,765
You got others?

30
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,432
No. You're my first clown.

31
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,148
Will I ever see you again?

32
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,706
Maybe.

33
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,513
What's your name?

34
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,953
Shakes. Shakes the clown.

35
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,094
Oh, my head!
Goddamn it!

36
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,111
<i>What a fiesta we are having on</i>
<i>the "Palukaville Morning Zoo"</i> here...

37
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,175
<i>on K.L.A.R. D.</i>

38
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,187
<i>That's K-LARD.</i>

39
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,052
<i>- I'm Larry Loud.</i>
<i>- And I'm Barry Obnoxious.</i>

40
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,557
<i>And we're Loud and Obnoxious.</i>

41
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,560
<i>Oh, boy, what a weekend I had.</i>

42
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,189
<i>I went to my psychiatrist</i>
<i>and I went in and said...</i>

43
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,531
<i>"I don't know what's wrong with</i> me.
<i>I'm a teepee. I'm a wigwam."</i>

44
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,093
<i>He said, "Your problem is</i>
<i>you're two tents. "</i>

45
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,141
<i>Well, okay. Let's go directly</i>
<i>to the telephones here.</i>

46
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,177
<i>You're on "The Morning Zoo."</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,772
<i>- I'm fine. Who is this?</i>
<i>- Barry Obnoxious on "The Morning Zoo."</i>

48
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,647
<i>Do you listen to K-LARD?</i>

49
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,016
<i>No, I don't listen to you.</i>
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

50
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,682
<i>I'm an invalid!</i>
<i>I had to come down 14 stairs.</i>

51
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,194
<i>Too bad you had to get out of your sick</i>
<i>bed, but this is "The Morning Zoo."</i>

52
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,229
<i>I think it's something important,</i>
<i>I don't know who it is.</i>

53
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,492
<i>Some asshole on a radio program!</i>

54
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,125
<i>Okay, we got a crazy guy on the phone.</i>
<i>I want to thank you.</i>

55
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,897
<i>Got yourself a free T- shirt.</i>
<i>Come to the station and pick it up.</i>

56
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,906
<i>I gotta empty my colostomy bag,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

57
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,772
- Hey, buddy, I gotta use your can.
- Hold it, jerk. Not so fast.

58
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,576
- What?
- Bathroom is for paying customers only.

59
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,783
Don't I get a free mug?

60
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,120
Man! Fucking people.

61
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,006
When we built this place,
there wasn't a clown in the area.

62
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,888
- Good morning, tiger. How you doing?
- You're late. You the clown?

63
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,654
- No. I'm Mary fucking Poppins.
- Watch your mouth, mister.

64
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,924
- I'm talking to you.
- I don't care who you're talking to.

65
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,660
Let's get a couple things straight.
One: I'm not your pal.

66
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:25,830
Two: I need $150 cash
in advance up front.

67
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,497
And three:

68
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,967
If you ever talk to me again...

69
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,501
I'm gonna twist your head
into a fucking balloon animal.

70
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,514
- Okay?
- Okay.

71
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,148
Nice hair.

72
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,279
Thanks.

73
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,093
Smooth.

74
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:57,192
- Lawn bowling, it's just so wonderful.
- I can't concentrate on the game.

75
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,761
I gotta know if Shakes
got that TV show.

76
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,105
- What's the rush? We'll find out.
- If he gets it, he'll use his friends.

77
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,167
- Who are his best friends?
- Me and you.

78
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,976
So he gets us on TV,
we get plenty of babes.

79
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,212
Shut up. You get babes 'cause
you're cool, not 'cause you're on TV.

80
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,187
- What do you know about women?
- I know the deal.

81
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,382
You haven't had a woman
since I known you.

82
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,550
I've been busy juggling
and doing shit.

83
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:25,359
You get on TV, all that will change.
Everybody on TV gets lots o' pussy.

84
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,992
- Weathermen get a lot of pussy.
- Huh?

85
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,798
Weathermen get a lot of pussy.

86
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,068
Weathermen don't get
the kind of pussy I got.

87
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,042
I got that peanut butter pussy...

88
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,841
brown, smooth and easy to spread.

89
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,751
Come on, Billy.
We're all bored.

90
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,253
Let's get the sushi out of the sun.

91
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,414
Ow, ow, ow.

92
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,253
Mom.

93
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,332
Boring!

94
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,404
Hi, kids.
It's your friend, Shakes the clown.

95
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,647
It's giving me trouble,
so we'll put it in here.

96
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,216
Where'd it go?

97
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,946
- Lucy, look!
- All right!

98
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,948
I knew you could do it!

99
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,713
Ow. The real bowlers said
if I win another interstate...

100
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,948
I have a really good chance
of going pro.

101
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,957
- They know what they're talking about.
- I'm just so happy.

102
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,653
So, was your boyfriend Shakes
there last night?

103
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,856
No. He was up all night
with a sick friend.

104
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,423
Judy, he was chasing broads
and drinking their beer.

105
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,698
I haven't told this to anybody,
but I think...

106
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:49,229
maybe Shakes is an alcoholic.

107
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,243
Judy, don't use the medical term.
The guy's a drunk and a half.

108
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,212
- Of course he's an alcoholic.
- You're right.

109
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,877
Look, a pretty bowler like you,
you can have any man in the world.

110
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,718
I should start thinking about my career.
This has happened to other girls, right?

111
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,850
- Mm-hmm.
- You get with a guy, things go wrong.

112
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,419
Next thing you know, you end up dead
at the bottom of a motel swimming pool.

113
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,488
Every time.

114
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,093
You gotta lose this guy, all right?
A bad clown could really fuck you up.

115
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:28,038
<i>I love to make you grin and laugh</i>
<i>'cause I'm Peppy the clown</i>

116
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,073
<i>If you wore a frown</i>
<i>Now I hope it's upside- down</i>

117
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:36,178
<i>Although the show is over</i>
<i>I really hate to go</i>

118
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,952
<i>But we'll be back tomorrow</i>
<i>with a brand-new show</i>

119
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,826
As soon as that camera is off,
he's gonna fuck that little dog.

120
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,666
<i>Yes, kiddies, that's right.</i>

121
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,571
<i>This is my last show.</i>

122
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:00,010
<i>Your old Uncle Peppy</i>
<i>is being retired from the show.</i>

123
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,377
Forget all that shit.
Who's the new host?

124
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,976
<i>Kiddies, I just know you're gonna love</i>
<i>my replacement... Binky.</i>

125
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,782
Binky? What the fuck!

126
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,819
<i>Good-bye.</i>

127
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,191
<i>Say good-bye, Peppy.</i>
<i>Good-bye.</i>

128
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:23,094
- Now we'll never get laid.
- Don't say that. We'll get laid.

129
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,865
We'll still get laid.

130
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,633
It's gonna be all right.

131
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,298
Binky?

132
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,173
Geez, who made this planet?

133
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,577
<i>We love you. Bye.</i>

134
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,881
Here's to shit in your nose,
you big phony asshole.

135
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,046
Dog fucker.

136
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,162
You clowns done?

137
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,769
Oh, those hands...

138
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,604
Fabulous hands.

139
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,267
You just have such neat hands.

140
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,108
Hands that were made for much better
things than cleaning up clown vomit.

141
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,774
Exciting things.
I see a clown in your future, Judy.

142
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,583
I see you doing things
that regular women can only dream of.

143
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,247
Binky.

144
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,882
Judy.

145
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,094
Blow me.

146
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,531
Your face wasn't made
to be getting hit with pies.

147
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,503
Don't laugh at me!

148
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,842
Am I a joke to you?
Some kind of a gag?

149
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,509
Get up.

150
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,617
Hands.

151
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,766
I can't breathe.

152
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,609
You guys are nuts.

153
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,612
Is it just me or has it been
extremely humid lately?

154
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,481
That wet kind of humid heat
that you only get in Palukaville.

155
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,124
You know what they say
about Palukaville...

156
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,786
"You don't like the weather,
stick around a while. It'll change."

157
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,426
Pretzel?

158
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,135
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
No what? No what?

159
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,796
No, thank you.

160
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,465
- Pretzel.
- Yeah, please.

161
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,840
Yes, please. No, no.
You don't take the pretzel.

162
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,209
I give you the pretzel. Open.

163
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,515
Body of Binky.

164
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,310
Amen.

165
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,029
Bye!

166
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,133
Bye, Shakes.

167
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,838
Bye.

168
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,082
- I'm so nervous.
- Why?

169
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,122
I'm taking those
gourmet cooking classes at PCC.

170
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,715
- PCC?
- Palukaville Community College.

171
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,317
- Oh. I couldn't get in there.
- I test well.

172
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,990
Could I have another napkin?
I'm determined to be a great chef here.

173
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,533
I'm nervous I'm gonna flunk
my final tomorrow.

174
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,935
Are you serious?
You are one of the best cooks I know.

175
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,907
Gus, I need my batter broil here.

176
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,172
I'll tell you your problem.
You're afraid of women.

177
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,442
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are. You never talk to them.

178
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,006
Yes, I talk to women all the time, man.

179
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,575
The only woman you ever talk to
is your mother.

180
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,749
So? Everyone likes my mother. What's
the difference? She's a nice lady.

181
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,055
Yeah, but you need to talk to women
who aren't your mother like...

182
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,654
like Lucy, right now.

183
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,426
What do you mean, right now?

184
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,163
- I mean go over there and talk to Lucy.
- You think I'm afraid?

185
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,296
- Yes, you're afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

186
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,966
I'll talk to her right now.
I ain't afraid.

187
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,136
Why don't you sit back,
enjoy and watch the master.

188
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,949
In the eighth, I completely tugged
and left the Nixons.

189
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,543
- Nixons?
- The 4-6-7-10 split.

190
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,249
Up until then I'd been hitting
the pocket all night.

191
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,257
- Hi, ladies.
- Did you pick up the spare?

192
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,590
I was really nervous 'cause I knew
I had a chance to win the match.

193
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,893
So, I throw a gutter ball,
but at the last moment...

194
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,162
it pops back into the lane
picking up the split!

195
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,795
Unbelievable!

196
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,931
- You guys know what time it is?
- 7:30.

197
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,750
- I think he likes you.
- He's nice, but he's a man.

198
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,048
So, how'd it go, master?

199
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,721
It went good, I guess. She was
making major eye contact with me.

200
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,163
- You didn't even talk to her.
- What are you talking about?

201
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,326
You saw me talking to her.

202
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,860
You were just standing there
moving your lips.

203
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,602
I asked her what time it was.
She told me it was 7:30.

204
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,112
That's the cornerstone of a lasting
relationship, what time it is?

205
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,444
Yes, yes, because first,
I asked her what time it is.

206
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,781
Tomorrow I get to ask her the date.
Day after that she's all over me.

207
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,912
That's how it works.
You play it slow.

208
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,492
Hey, waitress, what time is it?

209
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,085
It's 7:35, good-lookin'.

210
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,698
See?

211
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,896
What is a corn dog? Well, it's kind of
like a hot dog on a stick...

212
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,768
and they take it...

213
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,137
Sweetheart. Pumpkin.
Hey, doll face.

214
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,144
Don't you "sweetheart,
doll face, pumpkin" me!

215
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:11,148
- Where were you last night?
- I-I-I... Where was I last night?

216
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,652
- Where were you last night?
- I was up with a very sick friend.

217
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,654
What? Who?

218
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,917
- Pete.
- Pete?

219
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,893
Oh, Pete. Right. Then what's this
lipstick on your little funny tie?

220
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,952
It's not Pete's lipstick, is it?

221
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,692
- That's blood.
- From what?

222
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,961
Pete had an angina attack.

223
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,095
Angina? Pete is a man.

224
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,433
Baby, I'm sorry.
I'm truly sorry.

225
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,875
Last night,
there I was in the alley...

226
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,743
almost fulfilling my dream of becoming
a professional bowler...

227
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,078
I look around
and you aren't there.

228
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,553
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to feel?

229
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,452
I'm sorry.

230
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,321
- I should have been there.
- You should have been there.

231
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,327
- I planned on going there.
- And what happened?

232
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,955
Your little friend Pete
had an angina attack.

233
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,263
I know what you mean by angina, but it
wasn't Pete's angina you were after.

234
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,908
Shakes, if you want to drink and run
around with other women, that's fine.

235
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,140
Just don't make me look like
an a-hole in the process.

236
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,012
Fuck!

237
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,019
Jesus Christ.

238
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,878
- How you doin', Pep?
- How am I doin'?

239
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:58,048
Blow it out your ass,
you useless bag of shit!

240
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,590
Nice talking to you.

241
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,058
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

242
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,995
A real, real pleasure,
I'm sure.

243
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,998
Assholes.

244
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,399
Oh, uh, Peppy,
you dropped your thesaurus.

245
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,236
What's he so pissed off about?

246
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,970
'Cause he got fired
from the TV show.

247
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,069
Fired? I thought he retired.

248
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:25,606
No, he was just telling everybody that
because his ego was bruised.

249
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,448
Yeah. You know,
I'm really surprised that...

250
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,785
you know, that I haven't
been asked to host yet.

251
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,957
What?

252
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,825
You haven't heard?

253
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,330
No, I haven't heard nothing.
What are you talking about?

254
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,128
Binky's the new host.

255
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,826
Binky's the new host?

256
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,067
Binky? What the fuck? That guy
can't even throw... I don't care!

257
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,043
That guy can't even throw
a fucking pie straight. He's not funny.

258
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,841
- Did he ever make you laugh?
- No, he's not funny.

259
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,382
I read for that part.
That part was mine!

260
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,475
You guys know that.

261
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,417
I don't even mind
that's he's not funny.

262
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,423
What really bugs me is that as a human
being he's nothing but a lump of shit.

263
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,949
- Howdy-doody, Shakes.
- Hi. I was just talking about you.

264
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,394
- How's your cirrhosis?
- Fine.

265
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,728
How's your disease-ridden cock?

266
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,695
- My cock! How dare you...
- Fucking douche bag!

267
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,740
I'll flatten every single one
of your heads, like pancakes!

268
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh, yeah? Well, the only show
you could ever get on...

269
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:30,143
would be a show called
"The Not Funny Diarrhea Club."

270
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,350
Fart face.

271
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,911
What the fuck are you talking about?

272
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,950
What are you, eight?
Get out of my face, all of you!

273
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,498
Oh, really scary.

274
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,971
Geez, boy, he really told us, huh?

275
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,563
Fucking dickheads.

276
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,804
What the hell is wrong with them?
I thought you were gonna kill 'em, man.

277
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,245
Guys like that, you know,
they give clowns a bad name.

278
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,714
Damn straight.

279
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:21,196
What are you doing sneaking up on me?
You scared the bejesus out of me.

280
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,826
- You still sore, huh?
- Yes, I'm still sore.

281
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,029
What do you expect from me?

282
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,902
- Baby, I can't explain everything.
- Shakes, I don't want to hear it.

283
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,442
Go away, Shakes.
I don't want to see you.

284
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,968
I don't want to talk to you.
Go away.

285
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,638
Baby.

286
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,813
I don't want to talk to you.

287
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,379
Leave me alone.

288
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,603
It's not gonna work.

289
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,038
You've hurt me too many times
and you don't take me seriously.

290
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,201
I take you serious.

291
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,713
How did it go last night?

292
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,305
Well, I did pretty good.
I won the first seven frames.

293
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:15,717
Then at the last moment I left
the Nixons... the 4-6-7-10 split.

294
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,721
And then right at the...

295
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,451
You're not listening to me.
You're looking over there.

296
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,585
I wasn't. I was looking over there,
but I was listening to you.

297
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,859
You were talking about Watergate
or something like that.

298
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,162
Forget it.

299
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,498
I just don't care about you anymore.

300
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,231
What do you mean,
you don't care about me anymore?

301
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,937
I'm just saying that it's all over
between the two of us.

302
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,609
That's great.
That's fan-freaking-tastic.

303
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,049
Shakes, are you all right?

304
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,287
See, baby, you still
do care about me.

305
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,229
Shakes, you are a real rat turd.

306
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,365
- You all right, buddy?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

307
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,099
Moron. Hey, Madonna,
where you going?

308
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,301
Need a ride, fresh cream,
cottage cheese?

309
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:15,142
- Leave me alone, milkman scum!
- Half and half?

310
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,513
Stupid fucking clown.

311
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,215
My colon.

312
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,843
What, the cigar bothers you now?

313
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,785
No. Actually, it reminds me
of my uncle.

314
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,914
- Your uncle smokes cigars?
- No, he stinks.

315
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,117
Come on, guys.
Let's call it a night.

316
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,389
All right, all right.
Keep your shirt on.

317
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,828
- See you later, Shakes.
- Good night, Shakes.

318
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,388
Good night, guys.

319
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,934
Don't forget.
You got that gig tomorrow.

320
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,470
I'm leaving right now.

321
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,968
I'm right behind you.

322
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,915
- See you later, buddy.
- Go home, Murray.

323
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,646
The dotmobile.
See you later.

324
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,654
You should fix that clutch.

325
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,021
- Do you remember where we're parked?
- I've got to urinate.

326
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,360
- Hello?
<i>- Shakes, it's me, Stan.</i>

327
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,060
Hey, how you doing?

328
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:53,070
<i>How am I doing?</i>
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

329
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,702
- What?
<i>- Bastard! You did it to us again.</i>

330
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:04,647
- Jesus Christ.
<i>- Two hours we've been waiting on you.</i>

331
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,980
<i>You don't care.</i>

332
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,352
- You're really bitter, you know that?
- I was bitter, I admit, for a while.

333
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,559
But I've conquered that,
and now I just feel lucky...

334
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,761
that I have Brainiac as a partner.

335
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,600
You don't believe
I'm mentally superior to you?

336
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:31,199
- Ask me a question. Come on.
- I don't have any questions for you.

337
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,143
All right. What's a Shondell?

338
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,907
What?

339
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,245
What? What's a Shondell?
Like Tommy James and the Shondells.

340
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:43,276
Remember that? "Crimson and Clover,"
"I Think We're Alone Now," "Mony Mony."

341
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,346
Yeah, I remember the goddamn band,
all right?

342
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,892
- What's a Shondell?
- Who cares?

343
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,020
- What kind of idiotic question is that?
- You're upset 'cause you don't know.

344
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,362
- No, I'm not getting upset.
- It's not a crime. Big deal.

345
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:59,961
The point is is that there are things
that you accept and things you question.

346
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,768
- So you're upset 'cause you don't know.
- I'm not upset!

347
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,469
You know what? At this point, you should
be watching your blood pressure.

348
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,444
There's nothing wrong
with my goddamn blood pressure!

349
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,447
Yep. Lunch break.

350
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,777
All right.

351
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,278
Duh, hi, kids.
It's Shakes...

352
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:18,947
Fuck.

353
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,260
Duh, hi, kids.
I'm Shakes the clown.

354
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,832
What is that you got over there?
What's that, pastrami?

355
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,301
You think that's a good idea?
You think that's wise, pastrami?

356
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:42,278
Yes. It's not only wise,
it's kosher.

357
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:46,010
And it's none of your goddamn beeswax
what I eat and what I don't eat.

358
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:49,611
I don't need a goddamn food monitor
sitting next to me in the car.

359
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:53,088
Hey, I'm not the one the doctor called,
"A candidate for the coronary"...

360
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,093
thankfully through working out,
nice healthy diet.

361
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,595
Healthy as a horse. Knock wood.

362
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,431
What the hell was that?

363
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,867
- Take off!
- You see the hair on that guy?

364
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,098
We got a freak. Oh, boy.

365
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,575
Fuck!

366
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,414
I got him. I got him.

367
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,916
Oh, my God!

368
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,509
- Shut up and calm down!
- Let me drive!

369
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,021
Get your hands off the wheel!

370
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,387
- You don't know how to drive!
- Get away from me!

371
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,624
There. See?

372
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,658
- I can't move my head.
- You seen this?

373
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,363
They clean your windshields.
This is great. Watch.

374
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,202
- Give me a buck. I'll give it to him.
- Are you insane?

375
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,868
Fuck you.

376
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,845
- Thank you. Looks good.
- What are you thanking him for?

377
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,848
Oh, my goodness!
It's dirtier now than it was!

378
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,884
Ducks!

379
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,312
Shit!

380
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:07,922
All right, out of the car, clown!
Come on! Out! Hands on the roof!

381
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:12,163
You better pray those water fowl are
all right. You're in a lot of trouble.

382
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,871
Look out, look out, look out.

383
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:21,036
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.
Make your parents proud?

384
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,570
- Let's just get them out of here.
- Another white-collar criminal.

385
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:29,086
I bet you were a big hit in lockup.
Checkered pants down around your ankles.

386
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:32,088
Everybody loves a clown,
so why don't I?

387
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,020
You ought to keep a little better
control over your clowns, mister...

388
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,656
Cheese. Owen Cheese.
U-Rent-A-Clown.

389
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,359
Oh, my card.

390
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,162
Hey, did you see that?

391
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,727
If you're gonna have a policeman's ball,
a social, anything...

392
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,138
you know, a clown is the difference
between a party and...

393
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,642
a really nice party.

394
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,836
I'll bet.

395
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:58,349
He would have gotten off with just
a few minor traffic violations...

396
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,477
if he hadn't twisted my Breathalyzer...
which is Palukaville Police property...

397
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,953
into a goddamn French poodle!

398
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,620
I smell pastrami.
You guys have pastrami for lunch?

399
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,496
Well, I had a salad.

400
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,035
- What?
- For lunch.

401
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,597
I had a salad, muffin... light lunch.
Feel good. Nothing heavy.

402
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,939
This is a big goddamn joke to you,
isn't it?

403
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,104
The man asked me about pastrami.
I'm doing my job.

404
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,978
Lighten up. A little protecting
and some serving.

405
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,214
You'd be serving parking citations
to pimps at 4:00 a.m. If I had my way.

406
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,619
- Are we free to leave?
- Yeah. Get out of here.

407
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,557
- Thank you.
- Please. And don't come back either.

408
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,493
- Believe me, we won't.
- Good.

409
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,792
Do me a favor...

410
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,424
See? Now those things
are gonna kill you.

411
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,664
I'll kill you before they kill me,
you can count on that.

412
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,298
Don't walk away
when I'm talking to you.

413
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,467
Why do you do this to me?

414
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,445
I mean, your total disregard
for the clown code of ethics...

415
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,880
would make your poor father, Lippy...
God rest his soul...

416
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,941
turn over in his grave.

417
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,317
Now meet me in the office
at 5:00.

418
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,652
Oh, and Shakes.

419
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,856
Take a bath, will you?

420
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,965
- You're still not talking to me?
- Yeah, we wanna talk to you, Shakes.

421
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,635
- Look, me and Dink...
- Just tell him.

422
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,873
- We think you drink too much.
- You got a problem.

423
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,211
I got a problem?
I got a big problem.

424
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,375
My best friends
are fucking assholes.

425
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,386
Seriously, Shakes,
you drink way too much.

426
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,980
Where do you get balls like that
saying I drink too much?

427
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,585
I don't see you guys having any trouble
whatsoever keeping up with me.

428
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,028
I don't have a problem with alcohol.
I could stop any time I want to.

429
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:57,534
I just don't 'cause I'm having
a lot of fun with my drinking.

430
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,864
Oh, here we go.

431
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,200
Did he puke in my car?

432
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,173
No big pieces.

433
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,835
Idiot!

434
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,612
Hey, you guys want a beer?

435
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,886
- Sure.
- What the hell. Give me a goddamn beer.

436
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,289
Sorry about bogarting.

437
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,453
A couple of frosties
for the boys.

438
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,383
Ah, Shakes the clown.

439
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,794
It'll take a lot of birthday parties
before you can pay for this suit.

440
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,356
You got a lot of balls coming here,
you no-good, drunken bum!

441
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,765
Give me my goddamn hat!

442
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,867
Your father's a bum!
Your father's father's a bum!

443
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,970
Everybody here is a bum!
Now get the hell out of here!

444
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,876
Mimes! Mimes!

445
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,918
Stop the car! Kill! Destroy!

446
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,079
Clowns! Shit!

447
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,885
Run!

448
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:03,256
You silent motherfucker, yeah!

449
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,922
Come on!
You can run but you cannot hide!

450
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,438
You only pick on us
'cause we're artists.

451
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,102
Ah, fuck you, man.
Get out of this box.

452
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,949
Bastards!

453
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,081
You people are sick!
You need help!

454
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,421
Learn how to speak.

455
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:38,920
<i>Shakes...</i>

456
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,692
when your poor father died...

457
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,997
in that elephant mishap...

458
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:49,597
I promised your mother I'd take care
of you as if you were my own.

459
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,302
Well, you... you've always
kept up that promise.

460
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,105
You've always been like
a father to me or something.

461
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,809
If your drinking...

462
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,547
interferes with work one more time,
I'm gonna have to fire you.

463
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,748
Understand?

464
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:06,812
Yeah.

465
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,019
If I have one complaint
from one parent...

466
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,528
one kid, one dog...

467
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:15,623
I'm gonna fire you so fast...

468
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,895
you'll be out of work immediately.

469
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,672
- Don't do that. It's annoying.
- Sorry.

470
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,472
Hey, come on.

471
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,814
You made me blow that shot.

472
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,031
He says that if I fuck up
one more time...

473
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,192
I'm gonna get fired.

474
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,863
- Oh, this is serious, Shakes.
- What are you gonna do?

475
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,897
I'm not gonna drink at work anymore,
that's what I'm not gonna do.

476
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah, right.

477
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:04,104
You haven't drawn a sober breath
since I've known you.

478
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,275
I resent that.
I've been sober plenty of times.

479
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,285
When?

480
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,816
What about when I was in my coma?

481
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:18,487
That entire month
I did not have one drink.

482
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,496
And when...

483
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,933
when I had to go to court.

484
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:28,438
You got shit-faced at the judge's
chambers and juggled his gavels.

485
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,767
That's settled.

486
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:36,108
From now on, me and Dink are gonna
go with you on your rounds...

487
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,444
to make sure you don't drink.

488
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,280
I don't need you guys.
I don't have a problem.

489
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:44,344
- I can stop on my own, thank you.
- I'm sure you can...

490
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:49,325
but we're gonna go with you just to
make sure you get off to a good start.

491
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,191
To Shakes and his newfound sobriety.

492
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,627
Hang in there, Shakes.
Hang in there.

493
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:02,230
- I gotta have a drink.
- No, you don't. You don't got to.

494
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,374
I gotta have a drink.

495
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,435
Shakes, last night I came this much
closer of fulfilling my dream...

496
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,970
of becoming a professional bowler
and you weren't there.

497
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,983
How's that supposed to
make me feel?

498
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,316
Don't think about it.
You don't gotta think about it.

499
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,549
Come on, please.

500
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,319
- Hang on.
- Calm down.

501
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,260
We're trying to help you, man.

502
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,006
I know if you have one
you'll want more.

503
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,970
All right, calm down.

504
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,447
- Oh, geez, he's puking!
- All right, just calm down.

505
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,484
Don't think about it, Shakes.

506
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,349
- Should we stop?
- Just keep going.

507
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,389
Oh, please, guys, give me one drink.

508
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,584
Don't think about it, Shakes!

509
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,355
- Calm down.
- Fight it.

510
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:02,388
- What are we gonna play, Dink?
- A nice game of Simon Says.

511
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:03,592
Okay, kiddies.

512
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,209
You're not funny, clown.

513
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,048
Give it a break on that horn,
will you?

514
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,785
Kid, if you blow that horn
one more time...

515
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,325
I'm gonna shove it
right up your ass.

516
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,099
Let me explain something to you.

517
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,759
You're a loser.

518
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:41,430
Your parents had to pay grown men
to come and play with you today...

519
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:45,066
because kids collectively,
on a whole, think you suck.

520
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,669
All right? If you want me to leave,
that's fine. I'm out of here.

521
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,805
I'm sorry.
Please don't go, mister.

522
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:54,009
- What's shakin', Shakes?
- Hey, everything okay?

523
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,416
Duh, I'm it.
We'll play hide-and-go-seek.

524
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,614
Get 'em out of the house.
Good idea.

525
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,055
Hide-and-seek.

526
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,026
- I'm it, everybody. Go, go, go.
- You okay?

527
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,085
I'm okay. I'm fine.

528
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,960
103, 108...

529
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,371
90, 92, 93...

530
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,968
94, 95, 96...

531
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,780
98...

532
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:38,125
32, 37, 36...

533
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,331
Gee...

534
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,937
G, F, K...

535
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,375
A...

536
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,871
Here I come...

537
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:01,543
ready or not,
you little bastards.

538
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,622
Mister, are you okay?

539
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,203
Oh, I hope he's dead!

540
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,241
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

541
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:02,439
Oh, nothing. My teacher nearly puked
when he tried my peach flan.

542
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:06,472
Are you serious? It can't be that bad.
Here, let me try it.

543
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,484
- Would ya?
- Sure.

544
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,651
You like it?

545
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,988
Yeah, it's good.

546
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,329
- You spit it out.
- No, I didn't.

547
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,855
- I saw you.
- No, it was yummy.

548
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,597
Is Shakes all right?

549
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,768
He's fine. He's got the toughest head
I've ever seen.

550
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,971
He's over at my place
sleeping it off.

551
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,037
He'll be sleeping it off
all night.

552
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,743
How you doing, fuckers?
How are we tonight?

553
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,752
Hi, Shakes.

554
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,359
Oh, pumpkin!

555
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:54,261
Why don't you all kiss my ass?

556
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,335
Oh, hi, boss.
How you doing?

557
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,565
You're fired.

558
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,804
I'm fired?
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

559
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,342
Oh, no.

560
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,508
Come on. Help me.
We gotta get him up.

561
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,518
Let's get him in the back room.

562
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,419
Shakes tipsy?

563
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,788
Gasp.
Oh, there's a surprise.

564
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,230
He looks so cherubic.

565
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:32,858
- What the hell does that mean?
- Like an angel.

566
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:36,372
Yeah, I'd like to stomp
his fucking angel head.

567
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:43,042
Well, here's to Mr. Cheese coming
to his senses and firing that loser.

568
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,412
Here's to Shakes getting fired.

569
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,082
He's thrown his last pie
in this town.

570
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,273
Okay, now go in the back room
and wait for the two rodeo clowns there.

571
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,139
I'll be there.
And Boots.

572
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,611
- Hmm?
- Remember the code?

573
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,226
We don't have to worry
about this guy. He's out of it.

574
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:36,292
Hi, boys and girls.
I'm Shakes the clown.

575
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,469
God, this guy must drink
formaldehyde.

576
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,134
Hey, let's put his hand
in hot water.

577
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,106
- What's that do?
- Makes him pee.

578
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,943
Oh, all right.

579
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,154
- Are you Binky?
- No.

580
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,657
- Is that Binky?
- No, that's not Binky.

581
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:04,285
- Then who the fuck are you?
- I'm Ho-Ho the clown. Nice to meet you.

582
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,660
Well, fuck you, party clown!
I don't like this. Let's leave.

583
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,756
Wait. I'll go get Binky now.

584
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,267
- Let me. I know right where he is.
- You entertain our guests...

585
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:16,898
Shut up! You're fucking with
the wrong clowns now, pal.

586
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,908
- My cyst!
- Let me do something to him.

587
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,568
- You wanna hurt him?
- Something.

588
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,204
He wants to hurt you.
Don't make eye contact, boy.

589
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,872
- You know where Binky is?
- Yeah.

590
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,247
- Then run and get him real quick.
- Okay. Will you excuse me, please?

591
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,650
- Don't look at him.
- Look at me. Is this yours?

592
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,689
- I can't breathe.
- Don't go crazy.

593
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,384
- He looked at me!
- I did not.

594
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,950
Just settle down.
You're in the barrel.

595
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,895
He's in the barrel.
It's okay. Just relax.

596
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,591
My cyst. Ouch.

597
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:47,569
And I'll tell you another
extremely interesting thing about me...

598
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,540
is that even though I've got this
big-time cartoon show on the air now...

599
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,439
I'm not gonna change.

600
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,638
I'm not gonna be one iota different
than I ever was.

601
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,238
- You know why I'm not gonna change?
- Why?

602
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,717
'Cause I'm an asshole!
Asshole!

603
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,777
You all hate me.

604
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,686
You all loathe me.

605
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,521
Make fun of my jokes,
think I'm not funny.

606
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,790
Think my balloon animals suck.

607
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,455
You know that.

608
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,563
Binky the doormat.
That should be my name.

609
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:23,595
Not Binky the clown.
Binky the doormat.

610
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,074
I don't stick up for myself.

611
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,668
They say the squeaky wheel
gets the grease.

612
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:32,647
I'm the quietest fucking wheel you've
ever seen 'cause I don't bitch at all.

613
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,651
I'm a wimp.
Fucking nuts, that's what I am.

614
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,654
Insane? No, I'm not insane.
I'm just different.

615
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:41,953
I didn't wear my crystal today.
That always makes me a little tense.

616
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,956
The dolphins are in the Jacuzzi.

617
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,795
Will you excuse me
for a moment, please?

618
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,328
- Sure. Go ahead. It's okay.
- Thanks.

619
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:00,208
Why is it I hate it
when he buys the drinks?

620
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,905
- 'Cause he acts like a maniac.
- Mm-hmm.

621
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:08,682
I don't understand why he can't just
drink normally like the rest of us.

622
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,084
He gets so out of control.

623
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:14,920
Maybe it's 'cause he saw his father
crushed to death by an elephant.

624
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,119
A thing like that
can scar you for life.

625
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,822
He drinks so much to forget
he's a fucking alcoholic!

626
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,195
Geez, Lucy, would you lighten up?

627
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,200
Cut the guy some slack.

628
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:27,760
Dink, Stenchy, do you guys
know where Shakes is?

629
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,602
Oh, he's still sleeping it off
back there.

630
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,734
Oh. I thought I'd give him
another chance.

631
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,210
Thank you, Mr. Cheese.

632
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,443
Jesus, Mary and Joseph hanging
off the cross, for Christ's sake.

633
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,950
Goddamn it! Shit!

634
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,818
- I'll see if he's still asleep.
- That is great, man.

635
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,291
Do it. Beak, Randi, beak.

636
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,954
Ow! Goddamn!

637
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,425
That's good stuff.

638
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:01,232
Whoo! Colombian prairie dog.
Got a mean kick on the back end, though.

639
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,706
But it's about the best stuff
you can get around these parts.

640
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:09,007
I tell you what. You boys ain't bad for
a bunch of pussy birthday party clowns.

641
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,651
Binky, you ever been kicked
in the head by a bull?

642
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,847
- Something like that.
- This old boy has about 100 times.

643
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:22,414
Here. Try some
of this stuff here, Binky.

644
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:26,258
But be careful, boy.
It's got a mean bite on the back end.

645
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,922
Well, salud.

646
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,338
Binky.

647
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,840
Say, wait a minute.

648
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,104
You clowns are on dope.

649
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:48,049
Where you going, old man?
You didn't see nothing, all right?

650
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:52,145
You saw five happy, jolly clowns
sitting around...

651
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,747
eating a big plate of beef...

652
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:00,194
white, powdery beef.

653
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,197
Binky, you son of...

654
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,746
Boys, the poop has hit the fan.

655
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,373
We just killed my boss.

656
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,980
Listen, Bink, it's been a lot of fun,
but we gotta hit the road.

657
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,285
We'll catch you on the flip-flop.

658
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,291
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

659
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,056
Witnesses.
Future cell mates.

660
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,589
Coke dealers.

661
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,929
Let's powwow.
Let's chitchat.

662
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,765
Let's palaver.

663
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,575
Well, all right, Bink.

664
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,614
What's the deal?

665
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,078
- It's your move.
- You know what?

666
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:01,147
I really gotta learn how he did that.
Remember that Cheese guy, the clown guy?

667
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,351
The thing with the card.
Hey, look.

668
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,954
That's the difference between a cop
and a really good cop.

669
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,429
Wasn't that amazing?

670
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:12,025
It was childish when he did it.
When you do it, it's infantile.

671
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,161
Now would you knock it off.

672
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,171
Go ahead.

673
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,099
Turn those off!

674
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,563
Now make it look like
there's been a fight.

675
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,008
- You don't talk to me anymore.
- You're insensitive to my needs.

676
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:57,672
That's a fight? I said a fight.
You're making it look like powder puffs.

677
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,738
- Mix it up.
- I know karate.

678
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,307
Well, I know the Vulcan nerve pinch.

679
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,822
- Fuck you, fucker.
- Why don't you kiss my rosy red ass?

680
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,348
Just lay him down on the floor
and shut up. I gotta use the phone.

681
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,361
You can't listen.
Take this, you...

682
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,159
Shut up! I'm telephoning.

683
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,439
Hello. Police department?

684
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,305
This is Mr. Owen Cheese
at the U-Rent-A-Clown office.

685
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:29,140
Oh, God. There's a guy in the office
and he's trying to murder me.

686
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,704
My life is in jeopardy.
Please come quickly.

687
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,986
They're on the way, boys.
Let's move 'em out.

688
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,027
You ever find yourself
sweating a lot?

689
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,758
- No.
- Headachy?

690
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,561
- No.
- Sudden mood swings?

691
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,603
I'll mood swing you right out
of this car if you don't knock it off!

692
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,332
I'm trying to concentrate
on my move!

693
00:52:58,408 --> 00:52:59,898
- Wait a minute.
- What?

694
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:04,675
You were just in the Peanut Brittle
House and now you're at Lollipop Woods.

695
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,682
- How the hell did that happen?
- Peter Crony.

696
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,684
Goddamn it!

697
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:14,156
<i>18-12, we've got a 7-11 in progress</i>
<i>at the U- Rent-A-Clown office.</i>

698
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,624
<i>17th and Central. Over.</i>

699
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,490
18-12 responding.

700
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,895
Why does this always happen
when I'm winning?

701
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,899
Remember, I'm green.

702
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,936
Open the door!
It's the police!

703
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,441
Open up immediately.
This is the police.

704
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,910
We can see you in there.

705
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,607
We know you're in there.
Come on out.

706
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,276
Step back.
We're gonna kick the door down.

707
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,748
He's going out the back.

708
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,859
- Damn it!
- Where the hell did he go?

709
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,326
I've been with you the whole time!
How do I know?

710
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,955
If you kept your eyes open
for once...

711
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,163
- Here. I'm gonna call for backup.
- Don't just grab it!

712
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,798
Things like that are exactly
why people hate you!

713
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:07,400
What do you mean? What kind of a broad,
general, sweeping statement is that?

714
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:11,038
- I've got lots of friends.
- I'm not talking about your friends.

715
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:15,380
I'm talking about everyday normal people
you meet who hate you right away.

716
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:19,149
101, 2010...

717
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,366
Will you stop that?

718
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,427
I thought you liked
"Lady of Spain."

719
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:40,465
I love "Lady of Spain," but that's
not "Lady of Spain," is it, Ty?

720
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:44,001
Damn. Just play something else.
I'm trying to count my money.

721
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,014
- Where was I?
- I'll play "Lady of Spain."

722
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,288
Hey, that's that damn clown.

723
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,625
Where? I'll ask him
if this is "Lady of Spain."

724
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,062
Get down, you dumb-ass!

725
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:09,100
Too bad about his accident.

726
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:12,437
- What accident?
- You know the one.

727
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:17,074
Where he was so distraught
by killing his boss...

728
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:21,675
who was like a father to him
that he ran himself off a cliff.

729
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,955
- Shit!
- That fuck-face!

730
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,209
Oh, great.

731
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:56,616
Meet your maker, party clown.

732
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,820
Hey, sorry about the headlight.

733
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:07,385
Tell you what. Pull over
and we'll exchange phone numbers.

734
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,227
Get an estimate...

735
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:14,066
Fuck you!
Pay for your own headlight, asshole!

736
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,103
Shit!

737
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,963
I just made my last payment.

738
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:56,005
Look at him.

739
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,013
- Are you watching?
- I'm watching.

740
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,549
Now watch me closely.

741
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,245
See? This is very important.

742
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,161
Jesus, Shakes!

743
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:17,597
Boar! Hey, Boar!

744
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:46,990
Hi!

745
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,997
Fuck you, clown!

746
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,577
Judy, I can't take it anymore.

747
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,875
The police came by
the Twisted Balloon tonight.

748
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,575
- I killed Mr. Cheese.
- What?

749
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,709
I killed Mr. Cheese.

750
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:47,017
You couldn't kill Mr. Cheese.
He was like a father to you.

751
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,685
You don't have it in you
to do something like that, honey.

752
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,355
Don't you realize all your problems
come from how much you drink?

753
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,829
What are we gonna do?

754
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:03,938
Shakes.

755
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:18,720
Jesus Christ!
I feel like a fucking idiot.

756
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,484
No, no, you look very sexy.
Very French.

757
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,150
I look sexy?

758
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:27,322
Do you realize if I saw myself
I'd have to kick my own ass right now?

759
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,298
Maybe you and your friends
will think twice about mime bashing.

760
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,197
Maybe you're right.

761
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,401
Hurry up, everybody!

762
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,564
Mime Jerry's gonna show us
some new routines he learned in France.

763
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,302
Come on.
Mime's a-wasting.

764
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:45,239
Hey, are you sure
you're gonna be all right?

765
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:48,716
Yeah, I'll be fine. Who's gonna
look for me in a mime studio?

766
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:52,949
Well, control yourself.
If you get into any trouble, call me.

767
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,456
Well, okay.
Thanks a lot, doll.

768
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,117
I'll see you later.

769
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,795
Let's start with our walls.

770
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:02,797
And go!

771
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:09,595
All right, everyone.
We're gonna be a cat in a box.

772
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,239
Ready? Here we are.

773
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:13,969
Use those claws.

774
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,604
Make me believe
that you're that little pussy.

775
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,942
Yes.

776
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:31,585
Huh?

777
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,265
I'm Mime Jerry.
And your name is?

778
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:41,430
My name is Chuck.

779
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,500
Chuck!
Everyone, let's welcome Chuck.

780
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,543
Silently, people!

781
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,980
Mime Chuck, would you like to be
my little helper today?

782
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,919
Yeah, that'd be tremendous.

783
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,578
Come on up, Chuck.

784
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,191
You forgot the stairs.
There's stairs here.

785
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:06,922
Whoa! There we go.
Come on up there. There we are.

786
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:11,023
All right, Chuck, in the future
the underwear should go on the inside.

787
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,536
And let's keep Mom's
candy-red panty hose at home, okay?

788
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,266
I don't want to see
what religion you are.

789
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,671
Ready?

790
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,675
Let's start with our walls.

791
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:22,608
And go!

792
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,806
Come on, Chuck.
We're doing a wall now.

793
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:28,317
Chuck, you're not copping a feel on
a big-tittied lady. Let's make a wall.

794
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,218
Are we on medication,
or don't we know what a wall is?

795
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:35,451
Let's make it a single wall,
not putting your hand in shit.

796
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,255
Tighten that wrist up,
or I'll break it.

797
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,761
There you go... Tighten it!
There we go.

798
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,320
Ready? There we are.

799
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,731
Let's make our wall.
There it is. It's all over us.

800
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:49,203
Uh-oh. It might be above us too.
It might be above us, Chuck.

801
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,332
What are we doing, a little watusi?
Come on, Chuck, make the wall.

802
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:55,070
All right, enough of that.

803
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:58,136
Everybody get ready to fry our bacon.
Ready?

804
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,580
Here we go!
Raise 'em!

805
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,777
Suck in the little pork belly.

806
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:05,616
And fry.

807
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,816
Come on, Chuck.
We wanna fry off that fat ass of yours.

808
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,951
Fry, fry, fry, Chuckie!

809
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,927
Everybody, let's sizzle.

810
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:17,227
We're gonna sizzle off
Chuck's little pork butt.

811
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,269
Fry yourself. Let the heat work
through you. Shake your meat.

812
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,998
You got a roll of quarters.
Make some change.

813
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,064
Now you're burning.
Now you're on fire.

814
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,905
Shake your money maker.

815
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,810
Think about being eaten,
and then curl up.

816
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,939
Curl up, Chuck!
There we go!

817
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,949
Come on.
Curl, curl.

818
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,179
You having an epileptic fit?
You okay?

819
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,596
- Who's there?
- Like you don't know.

820
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,655
It's me, Binky.

821
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,861
- What are you doing here, you creep?
- I brought these for ya.

822
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,665
They're very pretty.
Where'd you steal 'em?

823
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,710
If this bed could talk.
Huh, Judy?

824
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,916
I understand how you feel.
You're hurt. We're all hurt.

825
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:10,214
I mean, Shakes, a murderer?

826
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,515
Listen, Binky,
Shakes may be alcoholic...

827
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,022
and a bad lay...

828
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,888
but he's not a murderer.

829
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,758
How can you say
he's not a murderer?

830
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:25,267
He took a juggling pin and smashed in
Mr. Cheese's head with the thing.

831
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:28,201
Again and again and again,
just hitting and hitting...

832
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:32,230
and the head bursting
and splattering underneath.

833
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:36,244
Boots and HoHo could've stopped me,
but they didn't stop me!

834
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,877
Wait. Did I say "me" just now?

835
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,212
Yes.

836
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,652
Whoa. Back up.
Now I've gotta kill you.

837
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,850
Beautiful. Another red-letter day
for Binky the clown.

838
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:52,417
Just great.
Just great.

839
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,827
More bullshit and pressure
in my life!

840
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,329
All right, let's move on to...

841
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,892
riding a pony into the Grand Canyon.

842
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:05,066
This is kind of an existential mime
dealing with life and death.

843
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:08,599
All right, everybody, saddle up.

844
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,669
Saddle up, Chuck!
Come on, boy!

845
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,340
- Get on your pony.
- I'm on my pony.

846
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,850
All right, I see that, Chuckles.

847
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,751
Ready? And head 'em out.

848
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:21,289
Ride. You're riding
toward the canyon now.

849
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,552
Head 'em out. Hyah!

850
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:24,957
You lose that hat again...

851
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,291
I'll put it up your ass
and it'll be hard to walk in the wind.

852
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,662
There you go, boy.
Very good, everyone.

853
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,667
Hyah!

854
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:35,932
Come on, people.
This is not funny, this is serious.

855
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:39,532
You look like a bunch
of goddamn rodeo clowns.

856
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:53,451
Chuck, you didn't join us at all.
That really pisses me off.

857
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,456
Let's try it again.

858
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,617
Time out, everyone.

859
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,627
You're a clown, aren't ya?

860
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:02,289
- No, I'm not a clown.
- Really?

861
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,299
Let's try again.

862
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,495
All right, everybody,
ready to do this one?

863
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,266
This is the mime called "Puberty."
Ready?

864
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:13,308
All right, everybody.
Ladies, do something different.

865
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,037
Ready? Whoa!

866
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,807
<i>Hi, Judy here.</i>
<i>We'll, I'm not here.</i>

867
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,405
<i>- Leave a message. Bye!</i>
<i>- Hey, Judy?</i>

868
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:21,916
Yeah.

869
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:25,818
Judy, this is Mime Chuck.

870
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:29,824
I think I figured out something.
I'll see you later, okay? Bye-bye.

871
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,793
Oh, man.

872
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,427
I can't believe this is happening.

873
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,164
Me either.
He was a great guy.

874
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,403
He was a great guy.
He was the greatest guy.

875
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,808
- I don't know.
- Hey! Hey!

876
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,279
- Hey, dickhead!
- Somebody's callin' you.

877
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,610
A mime!

878
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:56,743
Jesus Christ, you stupid shit!
It's me!

879
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,386
Shakes, you're a mime!

880
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,754
I'm not a mime!

881
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:06,625
I knew it. Remember how he used to
sit for hours and not say nothin'?

882
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,630
This is a double whammy, man.

883
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:12,190
First I find out you killed someone.
Now I find out you're a mime.

884
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,792
That's weird!

885
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,928
I didn't kill Mr. Cheese.

886
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,303
Oh, yeah, all right.
Then who did?

887
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,766
It was some rodeo clowns!

888
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,475
Rodeo clowns.
Come on.

889
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:30,645
You know, I heard you.
You said you were gonna kill him.

890
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,087
You don't even know what you're doing
when you're drunk. That's the problem.

891
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:36,522
Yeah. Look, Shakes, just...

892
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,161
Turn yourself in to the police.

893
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:45,124
You gotta believe me, man.

894
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,134
Come on.

895
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,199
Where's Judy?

896
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,903
She ain't here.

897
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,741
Judy didn't show up for work?

898
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,581
- Yeah.
- No, she didn't show up for work.

899
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:05,279
She's not inside.
If you look inside, she's not there.

900
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,185
She's never late.

901
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:09,690
We gotta go find her.

902
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:16,263
You guys aren't gonna help me, huh?

903
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,102
- Come on.
- Shakes.

904
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,439
Shakes, come on.
We'll take my car.

905
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,446
Just promise me
you don't enjoy dressing like that.

906
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:35,610
The tights ride me in the crotch,
but outside of that it's not that bad.

907
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,948
It's just weird
to see you look like this.

908
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,046
- Hurry up.
- I can't move any faster in these heels.

909
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:46,953
Shit.

910
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:48,963
Oh, man.
I'm sorry Dink didn't believe you.

911
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,625
- Shut up, man. I believe him.
- Oh, you...

912
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,635
Guys, guys, guys, come on.
They got my girlfriend.

913
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,694
What are we gonna do?

914
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,707
We have to go to
that rodeo clown bar.

915
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,573
- The Broken Saddle?
- See, that's stupid.

916
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,671
- No. Those guys are tough.
- They're big there. They hit you.

917
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,683
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
You gonna help me or what?

918
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,219
I wanna go!
You're the idiot who...

919
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,723
- He's a chickenshit.
- Yeah, I'm chicken. Stupid idiot.

920
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:25,095
How you doin', Spur?

921
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,101
What's wrong with you, son?

922
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,865
Come on, Ty, let's go get some pussy.

923
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:38,242
Hey, cut it out.
Leave the damn people alone.

924
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:43,617
Oh, shit.
We're gonna get our asses kicked.

925
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,620
- Just act tough.
- Don't be intimidated.

926
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:52,083
Say, you rough, tough cowboys aren't
fixin' to mess up my joint, are ya?

927
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,789
No, we just wanted
a couple of beers.

928
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:59,699
Shut the fuck up! This here's a rodeo
clown bar, and you ain't rodeo clowns.

929
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,030
Yes, we are.

930
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:03,094
How come I ain't never
seen you here before?

931
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,042
'Cause we're from the east.

932
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,307
Yeah? Well, I'm from back east,
and I ain't never laid eyes on you.

933
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,708
We're from the Middle East.

934
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,717
Actually, Lebanon.

935
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:37,496
Hi, I'm Dink.
Nice to meet you.

936
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,768
- Dink this.
- Please don't hurt me!

937
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,505
I-I-I'm gonna go lie
next to my friends.

938
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,607
No! No! No!

939
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,913
Welcome back.

940
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,424
Jeez, we're gonna be here
all night.

941
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,455
Had enough?

942
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,966
That's it, man? Usually we gotta watch
you get your ass kicked for an hour.

943
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:13,031
That's the truck! The clowns
that ran me off the road! Get up!

944
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,372
Come on, let's go!

945
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,469
- See you later.
- Come on!

946
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,148
Falafel-eatin' assholes.

947
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,319
Calm down, Clown Judy.

948
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,550
I was nervous
my first time on TV too.

949
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,286
Turn that frown upside-down,
Clown Judy.

950
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:36,855
Did you know... This is a fact...
it takes 98 muscles to frown...

951
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:39,924
and only two to smile.

952
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,264
That's true!

953
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:43,464
Laugh and learn
with Binky the clown!

954
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:47,404
It's a shame
that your boyfriend Shakes...

955
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:51,310
won't be around to see
your big television debut!

956
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,142
Oh, perfection.
You look beautiful, Clown Judy.

957
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,480
Beautiful!

958
01:10:57,553 --> 01:11:00,488
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
I love you.

959
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,857
Oh, no!
It's that Shakes!

960
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,060
- Get the gun out!
- I am!

961
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:16,764
Come on, hurry up.
Get your gun out. Come on!

962
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:20,605
Why the hell did you
buy guns in pieces for?

963
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,610
Quit fuckin' around.
Get the gun together.

964
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,875
- Don't tell me what to do, pisshead.
- Don't you call me a pisshead.

965
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,210
Hiya, pissheads!

966
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:30,913
Shakes, are you sure
these are the guys?

967
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:32,351
Shoot him!

968
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,017
Look out!
Look out, Shakes!

969
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:38,025
Look out!
Oh, my God!

970
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,596
Suck butt, fudge pants!

971
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:48,033
- I'm gonna get me a couple of 'em.
- Yeah! How'd that feel, Shakes?

972
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,144
- Where'd they go?
- They're coming up here right now.

973
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,043
They're coming.
There they are.

974
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:07,118
That's them! They're pulling up
right alongside of us!

975
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:11,250
- All right, I'm gonna get 'em.
- You wanna play some more, party clown?

976
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,487
Hand me the pie.

977
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,119
- The what?
- The pie!

978
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,130
Get that gun out of my face, Ty.

979
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:20,532
- Then where the hell am I...
- Don't point it down there! Shit!

980
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,810
Grab the wheel! Grab the wheel!

981
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,115
Oh, shit!

982
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,016
Stop it!

983
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,686
Goddamn. Stop it.

984
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,197
Get out.

985
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,634
Jesus Christ!

986
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:00,672
Where's Judy?

987
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,938
You stupid fuck!
Where is she?

988
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,547
Where's Judy?

989
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,640
What did you do with her?

990
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,651
I don't know.
You gotta believe me.

991
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,653
Like you didn't try
to fuckin' kill me.

992
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,986
We thought you could frame us
for killing Cheese. We didn't do it!

993
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,616
Who killed Mr. Cheese?

994
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:20,184
Binky.
Cheese caught him doin' drugs.

995
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:23,322
So he went nuts
and killed the guy.

996
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,333
You gotta believe me, man.

997
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,000
You gonna be okay?

998
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:31,965
Yeah.

999
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,879
Come on, guys!
Let's go get Binky!

1000
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,586
All right, kids, listen up.
Hey, knock it off.

1001
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:49,590
What are we gonna do
when we see Binky the clown?

1002
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,182
No, I don't think so.

1003
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,388
You're gonna have to be more enthused
when you see Binky.

1004
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,488
You guys know
about sharing, right?

1005
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,261
That's what we want...
an 8.9 Nielsen share.

1006
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,199
It's an adult kind of thing.

1007
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,738
We're older.
We know what's funny.

1008
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,832
That's why we're helping you out with
this little deal here. Super? Good.

1009
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:10,037
So how's it gonna happen?

1010
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:13,013
That's it. You're getting it.
Give it up. Come on.

1011
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,345
What does it say? Harder.
Give it up!

1012
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,284
Come on! Do it! Come on!

1013
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:21,618
That's good. A little more.
Don't hold back.

1014
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,620
Three, two... Binky!

1015
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,662
<i>Good morning, kids</i>

1016

01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,804

01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:41,536
<i>Binky's my name</i>

Yeah!

1031
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,581
Just get in.

1032
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,141
See? I told you it was Binky.

1033
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:27,677
What? You're the only one
who still thinks it's Shakes.

1034
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,690
- No.
- No, you... Hey!

1035
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:32,522
- Get in the car!
- What's wrong with you?

1036
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:36,257
- When are you gonna admit you're wrong?
- I'll never admit that, because I'm not.

1037
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:40,392
You'll wake up one morning and say,
"It's time for me to admit I was wrong."

1038
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:43,802
And I'm gonna be there
when it happens.

1039
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:49,573
Hey, fellas. What say we go for
a little stroll, if you don't mind.

1040
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:51,135
Come on.

1041
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,147
Come on, let's go.

1042
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,946
Whoo!
That was a lot of fun!

1043
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,512
Another fun thing that we like to do
on the <i>Cartoon Circus...</i>

1044
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,524
is make new friends.

1045
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:06,026
I have a new friend
I'd like you to meet...

1046
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:09,530
boys and girls at home
and in the studio today.

1047
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,156
My new assistant...

1048
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,996
<i>The lovely</i>

1049
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,400
<i>Lovely, lovely</i>

1050
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,906
<i>Clown Judy</i>

1051
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,009
Say hi to Judy, everybody.

1052
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,537
We're gonna try something with Judy.
These are knives.

1053
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:29,049
Remember, you might want
Mom and Dad to help you...

1054
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,177
Whoa!
I have got butterfingers today.

1055
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,723
Oh, boy.
We're gonna try it anyway.

1056
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,725
Like some of you at home...

1057
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:42,492
Clown Judy
has not always been this...

1058
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:43,690
helpful!

1059
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,574
- You guys wanna get in the trunk?
- Don't ask 'em. Tell 'em!

1060
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:55,075
If you ask 'em,
they'll say "no."

1061
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,840
All right, all right.
Get in the fuckin' trunk.

1062
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:09,414
Shakes!

1063
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:15,763
Don't worry, Judy.
I hardly ever miss.

1064
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,689
Sorry about that.

1065
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:25,606
Gonna be hearing from the union
about that tomorrow.

1066
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:30,039
You piss me off.
You know why you piss me off?

1067
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:33,639
"Hi, Shakes. Could I get you
another beer, freshen it up?

1068
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,808
Maybe some Corn Nuts, Shakes?"

1069
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:41,121
Wait a minute.
Come back here.

1070
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,588
Let go of me!

1071
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,596
Get in the trunk.

1072
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,632
- Shakes, you're alive.
- What the fuck?

1073
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,963
Talk about a shot of whiskey,
huh, fellas?

1074
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,975
Let's go kick Binky's dick.

1075
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:04,479
Yeah!
Come on, let's go!

1076
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:05,877
Stupid shoes!

1077
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:08,882
But there were times
when I needed a little service too...

1078
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:10,881
babe.

1079
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,443
You just weren't interested,
were ya...

1080
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,547
doll face?

1081
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:22,163
What about me? What about Binky?
What about my needs?

1082
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:27,463
What about my needs
as a thirsty, horny clown?

1083
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,568
Yeah!

1084
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:43,216
I'm all right, kids!
I'm all right!

1085
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,823
Hey, knock it off! Come on, guys!
We're on the air! Cool it!

1086
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:00,334
Don't you push me!

1087
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,970
Rip his head off!

1088
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,990
Bartender,
can't you fix that TV?

1089
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,992
That's a hell of a shot.
All we got is his ass.

1090
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,142
Come on, Shakes, get up.

1091
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,303
Come on, you bum.
Roll over!

1092
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,098
<i>Oh, Shakes. Ohh!</i>

1093
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:14,108
Look at the lovebirds.

1094
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,701
Yeah. Ain't love grand?

1095
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:19,144
I gotta have her call me.

1096
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,079
How sweet it is.

1097
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:24,816
Are you gonna stop drinking
and get some help?

1098
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:28,117
- All right, here we go.
- Spread out. This is a police matter.

1099
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,124
Nice job, Shakes.

1100
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:33,423
- I don't regret a goddamn thing, Shakes!
- We're going to the rubber room.

1101
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:36,020
This is just the way I planned it!

1102
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,895
Oh, excellent plan!

1103
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:46,471
Hi. My name's Shakes,
and I'm an alcoholic.

1104
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,168
Hi, Shakes.

1105
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,177
Welcome, Shakes.

1106
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:55,346
I was thinkin',
all my life I've always been in trouble.

1107
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:57,351
I've never grown up.

1108
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,748
I tend to act like
the world owes me a favor...

1109
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:06,760
like it revolves around me
or somethin'.

1110
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:12,430
I never thought, sincerely,
that I'd be sober this long.

1111
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,669
And the only thing I know now...

1112
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:19,673
is that I really
just don't know anything...

1113
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:25,312
except what I learn here
and what you guys tell me.

1114
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:28,081
Thanks for letting me share.

1115
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:36,886
Until tomorrow, be good to yourself
and be your own dessert. Bye-bye!

1116
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:39,324
- Cut! That was super.
- Was it? Lucky me.

1117
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,862
Get the fuck off me, you shithead.
I could have you fired.

1118
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,363
- Judy, hi!
- Lucy!

1119
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:45,365
- You look so glamorous.
- Thanks.

1120
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:48,527
All I'm sayin' is,
you got a blank TV screen there...

1121
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:51,538
but in a few seconds
you got Stenchy and I coming on there.

1122
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:54,871
- TV stars is what I'm tryin' to say.
- See? I told you. TV, girls.

1123
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:57,537
Look, you guys, get lost.
We're the producers.

1124
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:00,376
Seriously?
Well, we like your show. It's cool.

1125
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:01,938
- Bye.
- Good night.

1126
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:06,386
Five, four, three, two...
show time!

1127
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:17,692
Hi, kids, it's me,
your friend, Shakes the clown.

1128
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,496
I've got an extra-special show
for you today.

1129
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:24,060
So please welcome my friend,
Mime Jerry!

1130
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:32,143
It's a mime!

1131
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,646
Get him!

1132
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:37,808
Help me! No! Please!

1133
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:02,270
Should we go to a cartoon?
Should we go to a cartoon?

1134
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:04,574
<i>When I was a kid</i>

1135
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:08,548
<i>My dad had pictures of these clowns</i>

1136
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:10,948
<i>He hung them on my wall</i>

1137
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:14,420
<i>And wouldn't let me take 'em down</i>

1138
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:18,118
<i>I didn't understand then</i>
<i>and I still can't figure out</i>

1139
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,388
<i>Still can't figure out</i>

1140
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:23,625
<i>What those goddamn clowns</i>

1141
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:26,826
<i>Were so sad about</i>

1142
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:34,339
<i>A clown was my boss</i>
<i>at every job I ever had</i>

1143
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:38,277
<i>Clowns run</i>
<i>all the record companies</i>

1144
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,314
<i>They never said we're bad</i>

1145
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:44,350
<i>A clown pretending to be a girl</i>

1146
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:47,411
<i>Who pretended to be my friend</i>

1147
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:50,287
<i>This world is run by clowns</i>

1148
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:53,088
<i>Who can't wait for it to end</i>

1149
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:56,653
<i>I have yet to meet a kid</i>

1150
01:23:56,731 --> 01:24:00,326
<i>Not scared to death of clowns</i>

1151
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,927
<i>They can't walk</i>
<i>and they don't talk</i>

1152
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:06,405
<i>They got painted- on frowns</i>

1153
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:09,773
<i>A clown with a gun</i>
<i>I hope I never see</i>

1154
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:12,108
<i>Hope I never see</i>

1155
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:15,911
<i>Would he shoot himself</i>

1156
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,714
<i>Or shoot me</i>

1157
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:23,853
<i>A clown taught every class I took</i>

1158
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:26,894
<i>At my old high school</i>

1159
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,156
<i>Clowns all wear Speedos</i>

1160
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:32,222
<i>When they hang out by the pool</i>

1161
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:36,134
<i>Clowns dress up like cops</i>

1162
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:39,139
<i>And threaten to call my folks</i>

1163
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:42,608
<i>This town is filled with clowns</i>

1164
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:45,271
<i>Who don't get my jokes</i>

1165
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:54,784
<i>They fall on their asses</i>

1166
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:57,916
<i>It takes lots of practice</i>

1167
01:24:57,992 --> 01:25:01,018
<i>They fall on their asses</i>

1168
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,156
<i>It takes lots of practice</i>

1169
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:08,362
<i>They fall</i>

1170
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:14,374
<i>They fall</i>

1171
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,774
<i>I have nightmares filled with clowns</i>

1172
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:23,147
<i>And you're there too</i>

1173
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:26,210
<i>You have a big red nose</i>

1174
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:29,381
<i>And stupid, floppy shoes</i>

1175
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,084
<i>You're becoming one</i>

1176
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,093
<i>I can see the signs</i>

1177
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:35,755
<i>I can see the signs</i>

1178
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,594
<i>I hate clowns</i>

1179
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:42,534
<i>And I hate mimes</i>

1180
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:49,007
<i>A clown was my boss</i>
<i>at every job I ever had</i>

1188
01:26:11,866 --> 01:26:13,800
<i>Wait for it to end</i>

1189
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:17,266
<i>Wait for it</i>

1190
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,499
<i>To end</i>
