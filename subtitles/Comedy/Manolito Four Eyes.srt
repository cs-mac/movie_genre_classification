{2347}{2409}- Come here.|- What?
{2851}{2934}- Good morning, Mrs Staples.|- Good morning, madam.
{3197}{3247}Late! Late!
{4587}{4659}Oh, fuck! Fuck!
{4764}{4797}Fuck!
{5059}{5161}- Fuck! Right, we take yours.|- It only goes 40 miles an hour.
{5411}{5461}What turn-off?
{5489}{5567}- Better not be the B359.|- It's the B359.
{5569}{5617}Fuck it!
{5717}{5754}Fuck!
{5879}{5901}Fuck.
{6189}{6247}Fuck.
{6467}{6494}Fuck.
{6497}{6529}Fuckity fuck!
{6654}{6701}Bugger.
{6929}{6979}Hello, Charles.
{7354}{7407}There's a greatness to your lateness.
{7409}{7477}It's not achieved without real suffering.
{7517}{7561}I am so sorry.
{7564}{7654}I'll be killing myself after the service,|if that's any consolation.
{7657}{7761}- Doesn't matter. Tom was standing by.|- Thanks, Tom. You're a saint.
{7764}{7811}Disastrous haircut.
{7917}{7981}- You haven't forgotten the rings?|- No.
{8439}{8504}Hate people being late. Hate it.
{8759}{8809}Here we go.
{9334}{9394}Oh, isn't she lovely!
{9397}{9481}Scarlett, you're blind.|She looks like a big meringue.
{9664}{9759}Dear friends, what a joy it is|to welcome you to our church
{9761}{9861}on this wonderful day|for Angus and Laura.
{9864}{9994}Before we start the service,|let us all join together in the first hymn.
{11504}{11549}Scarlett.
{11621}{11717}Dearly beloved, we are gathered|together here in the sight of God
{11719}{11771}and in the face of this congregation
{11774}{11877}to join together this man|and this woman in holy matrimony,
{11879}{11987}which is an honourable estate,|instituted in the time of man's innocency.
{11989}{12019}Back in a sec.
{12021}{12081}If any man can show|any just cause or impediment
{12084}{12144}why they may not be|lawfully joined together,
{12144}{12224}Iet him speak now|or for ever hold his peace.
{12251}{12324}Do you promise to love her, comfort her,
{12324}{12399}honour and keep her,|in sickness and in health,
{12401}{12497}and, forsaking all others,|keep thee only unto her
{12499}{12569}- for as long as ye both shall live?|- I do.
{12579}{12624}To love and to cherish
{12624}{12697}- till death us do part.|- till death us do part.
{12699}{12817}- And thereto I pledge thee my troth.|- And thereto I pledge thee my troth.
{12854}{12904}Do you have the ring?
{13071}{13187}- With this ring, I thee wed.|- With this ring, I thee wed.
{13189}{13244}With my body, I thee worship.
{13269}{13329}With my body, I thee worship.
{13331}{13399}And with all my worldly goods|I do thee endow.
{13409}{13499}And with all my worldly goods|I thee endow.
{13641}{13749}'lf I speak with the tongues of men|and of angels, but have not love,
{13751}{13839}I am become as sounding brass,|or a clanging cymbal.'
{13839}{13867}Good point.
{15249}{15337}- Great hat.|- Thanks. I bought it specially.
{15437}{15481}There.
{15649}{15717}Right. Get in position, please.
{15727}{15779}Thank you. Smile.
{15789}{15899}- Splendid, I thought. What did you think?|- I thought splendid. What did you think?
{15901}{15931}Splendid, I thought.
{15934}{15994}Scarlotta, fabulous dress!
{15997}{16057}The ecclesiastical purple|and the pagan orange
{16059}{16111}symbolising the symbiosis in marriage
{16114}{16177}between the heathen|and Christian traditions?
{16179}{16224}That's right.
{16234}{16301}Lovely. And again.
{16337}{16424}- Any idea who the girl in the black hat is?|- Name's Carrie.
{16427}{16494}- She's pretty.|- American.
{16499}{16521}Interesting.
{16524}{16577}Slut.
{16579}{16627}Really?
{16637}{16694}Used to work at Vogue.|Lives in America now.
{16697}{16759}Only goes out with|very glamorous people.
{16761}{16821}Quite out of your league.
{16841}{16891}Well, that's a relief. Thanks.
{16899}{16999}- See you there.|- Off you go.
{17021}{17081}Right. Reception.
{17177}{17227}Bye!
{17377}{17444}Anyone else tread in a cowpat?
{17444}{17511}No, thought not. See you in a mo.
{17514}{17599}Do you think l'd hate him as much|if he wasn't my brother?
{17639}{17749}Don't want to blow my chances|for romance by smelling of dung.
{17844}{17934}I never know what to say|in these wretched line-ups.
{17937}{18034}It's a cinch. Just give a big, warm hug|and say the bride looks pregnant.
{18037}{18144}- Or go for 'you must be very proud'.|- Heaven preserve us.
{18151}{18209}- You must be very proud.|- Indeed.
{18229}{18274}- Hello.|- Hello.
{18277}{18307}Hello.
{18469}{18549}Hi. We've met. It's Richard Maples.
{18581}{18631}Bastard.
{18791}{18827}Hello, Bern.
{18829}{18861}Two, please.
{18864}{18941}- You have fun.|- Take care.
{19011}{19069}- Hello.|- Hi.
{19099}{19181}- Do you want one of these?|- Thank you.
{19184}{19227}- I...|- Hello, Charles.
{19229}{19301}Hello, dear John.|How are you? How are you?
{19304}{19374}- Good. This is...|- Carrie.
{19377}{19444}- Delighted. I'm John.|- Hi, John.
{19484}{19561}- How's your gorgeous girlfriend?|- She's no longer my girlfriend.
{19567}{19624}Ah, dear. I wouldn't get|too gloomy about it.
{19627}{19734}Rumour has it she never stopped bonking|Toby de Lisle in case you didn't work out.
{19737}{19814}She is now my wife.
{19817}{19879}Excellent. Congratulations.
{19881}{19931}Excuse me.
{19951}{20014}Any kids or anything, John?
{20017}{20104}Do we hear the patter of tiny feet?
{20131}{20169}No.
{20169}{20269}Well, there's plenty of time for that,|isn't there? No hurry.
{20497}{20547}Hi. How are you?
{20917}{20989}- My name's Fiona.|- I'm Gerald.
{21019}{21107}- What do you do?|- I'm training to be a priest.
{21109}{21157}Good Lord!
{21169}{21234}- Do you do weddings?|- No, not yet.
{21234}{21299}I will, of course. Jolly nerve-racking.
{21301}{21381}Yes, rather like the first time one has sex.
{21424}{21471}Well, I suppose so.
{21474}{21579}Though rather less messy, of course,|and far less call for condoms.
{21784}{21854}How're you doing?
{21861}{21921}Remember the time|you started Dad's boat...
{21931}{21991}..and the propeller cut my leg to shreds?
{22001}{22029}This is worse.
{22151}{22257}- Who's that boy over there in the grey?|- His name's David.
{22271}{22331}Something of a dish, isn't he?
{22334}{22387}Well, l've always thought so.
{22389}{22457}- Why are they...?|- The dish can't hear.
{22509}{22534}Gosh.
{22537}{22644}Yeah, silent but deadly attractive.
{22661}{22709}Bang, bang, bang. That's it.
{22711}{22779}Into the marquee, please.|Dinner is served.
{22841}{22939}- How do you do?|- Hello. Tom. Splendid to meet you.
{22941}{22991}Very exciting.
{23279}{23314}Hi.
{23344}{23461}My name's Scarlett. Don't let me|drink too much cos l'll get really flirty.
{23501}{23614}- How do you do? My name's Charles.|- Don't be ridiculous.
{23614}{23751}- Charles died 20 years ago.|- Must be a different Charles, I think.
{23754}{23811}Are you telling me|I don't know my own brother?
{23814}{23839}No.
{24231}{24329}Ladies and gentlemen,|l'm sorry to drag you from your desserts.
{24331}{24429}There are just one or two little things|I feel I should say, as best man.
{24431}{24549}This is only the second time l've been|a best man. I hope I did OK that time.
{24551}{24631}The couple in question|are at least still talking to me.
{24669}{24764}Unfortunately, they're not|actually talking to each other.
{24767}{24849}The divorce came through|a couple of months ago.
{24889}{24981}But l'm assured it had|absolutely nothing to do with me.
{24984}{25121}Paula knew Piers had slept with her sister|before I mentioned it in the speech.
{25154}{25237}The fact that he'd slept with her mother|came as a surprise,
{25239}{25427}but I think was incidental to the|nightmare of recrimination and violence
{25429}{25499}that became their two-day marriage.
{25501}{25581}Anyway, enough of that.|My job today is to talk about Angus.
{25584}{25651}There are no skeletons in his cupboard.
{25654}{25717}Or so I thought.
{25739}{25837}I'll come on to that in a minute.|I would just like to say this.
{25919}{25957}I am,
{25959}{26124}as ever, in bewildered awe of anyone|who makes this kind of commitment
{26127}{26201}that Angus and Laura have made today.
{26214}{26289}I know I couldn't do it and
{26291}{26364}I think it's wonderful they can.
{26367}{26444}So, back to Angus and those sheep.
{26541}{26614}So, ladies and gentlemen,|if you'd raise your glasses.
{26617}{26677}The adorable couple.
{28267}{28329}I remember the first time|I saw Gareth dancing.
{28329}{28389}I feared lives would be lost.
{28447}{28521}She's a pretty girl -|the one you can't take your eyes off.
{28524}{28591}Is it love at first sight?
{28594}{28671}Good Lord, no!|lt's the bloke she's dancing with.
{28674}{28791}I played rugby with him at school.|I'm wondering what position he played.
{28819}{28889}Though, let's say,|for the sake of argument,
{28891}{28971}one did take a fancy|to someone at a wedding.
{28974}{29047}Do you think there really|are people who can say
{29049}{29141}'Hi, babe. My name's Charles.|This is your lucky night'?
{29167}{29244}- Well, if there are, they're not English.|- Quite.
{29284}{29367}Three weeks is about|my question-popping minimum.
{29389}{29479}You know I love you, Jean, don't you?|I love you. I love you.
{29494}{29627}And, Mike, l've never met you before,|but I love you very much. I really do.
{29669}{29737}Ignore her. She's drunk.
{29739}{29829}At least I hope she is.|Otherwise, l'm in real trouble.
{29894}{29959}- How's it going, Lyds?|- Bloody awful.
{29961}{30034}Oh, dear! What's the prob?
{30034}{30114}I was promised sex. Everybody said it.
{30117}{30214}'You be a bridesmaid, you'll get sex.|You'll be fighting them off.'
{30214}{30304}But not so much as a tongue in sight.
{30319}{30429}Well, I mean, if you fancy anything,
{30447}{30534}- I could always...|- Don't be ridiculous, Bernard.
{30534}{30617}- I'm not that desperate.|- No, right. Of course.
{30619}{30699}Fair enough. It's a good point.
{31101}{31131}Bye!
{31169}{31254}Have a lovely time! Bye!
{32004}{32061}Where are you staying tonight, Charles?
{32099}{32234}Scarlett and I are at some pub. The Lucky|Boat, something like that. Aren't we all?
{32237}{32309}No. Slight change of plan.
{32311}{32391}The others are coming back to my place.|Nansy's in residence.
{32394}{32479}Might knock us up a plate of eggs|and bake over a late-night Scrabble.
{32481}{32587}- I wondered if you'd like to join.|- Yeah! Thanks very much.
{32589}{32651}- Is there room for Scarlett?|- Absolutely.
{32654}{32704}1 37 rooms, actually.
{32739}{32829}Right. Tommy, are you|the richest man in England?
{32831}{32904}No!
{32907}{32974}I believe we're about seventh.
{32994}{33149}The Queen, obviously, and that|Branson bloke's doing terribly well.
{33149}{33249}Well, excellent news.|I'll go and tell Scarlett.
{33251}{33279}Yeah.
{33281}{33364}That's unless you get lucky first.
{33537}{33591}Hi.
{33594}{33664}Hi. I thought you'd gone.
{33664}{33799}No, not yet. I was just wondering|where you were staying tonight.
{33801}{33841}Well...
{33844}{33927}I was staying at some pub|called The Lucky...
{33929}{34009}- The Boat or something like that.|- Boatman.
{34011}{34089}Right. But now l'm going to stay|at some friends' house
{34091}{34151}with some friends.
{34154}{34247}Well, I think 'enormous castle'|is a more accurate description.
{34249}{34307}That's too bad,|because l'm at The Boatman.
{34364}{34469}Well, it was nice not quite meeting you.
{34507}{34567}- It was a great speech.|- Thanks.
{34709}{34839}- Well, l'm going now.|- No! No, no. Don't go. We can meet now.
{34839}{34944}- The evening's just getting going.|- We both know that's a big lie.
{35057}{35091}Fuck.
{35704}{35767}The castle beckons, Tom. Are you sober?
{35769}{35837}Absolutely. Orange juice all night.
{35894}{35921}Come on.
{36024}{36057}Bye, everybody!
{36059}{36114}All together now.
{36301}{36351}Bernard!
{36854}{36911}Tom, can you stop the car?
{36914}{36964}Stop the car.
{36997}{37101}Sorry. I just think|I might stay in that pub after all.
{37104}{37157}Why on earth...?
{37371}{37504}No, seriously. I'm doing some research|into pubs with the word 'boat' in the title.
{37507}{37587}- Oh, well. Please yourself.|- It's a silly thing.
{37729}{37779}Right.
{37847}{37897}Odd decision.
{38911}{38959}Hello.
{38961}{39011}- Hi.|- Hi.
{39031}{39087}In the end there wasn't room for all of us.
{39094}{39139}You said it was a castle.
{39141}{39251}Yes, it is a castle.|It's just a very, very small one.
{39254}{39319}Tiny, in fact.|Just one up, one down, which is rare.
{39321}{39367}Drink, sir?
{39369}{39447}Yeah. I'd like a glass of whisky, please.
{39449}{39504}- Do you want...?|- Yeah, sounds good.
{39511}{39569}- Another for the lady.|- Doubles, sir?
{39571}{39621}Thanks.
{39647}{39701}You here, too? How are you?
{39729}{39819}- Hello. I'm fine.|- Haven't seen Carrie, have you?
{39819}{39894}- Who?|- Carrie. American girl. Lovely legs.
{39911}{39971}Wedding guest. Nice smell.
{39974}{40039}- No. Sorry.|- Damn!
{40041}{40109}Blast! I think I was in there.
{40157}{40237}If you do see her,|could you tell her l've gone to my room?
{40239}{40271}Yeah.
{40274}{40324}- Your whisky, sir.|- Thank you.
{40327}{40384}- And one for the...|- Road. Lovely.
{40389}{40474}I think I might have one of those.|Do you mind if I join you?
{40474}{40571}- No. It'd be lovely.|- Another glass of whisky and a cigar.
{40574}{40664}Hold on. Make that a bottle.|We might as well settle in, eh?
{40667}{40724}Let's see if we can push on till dawn.
{40727}{40799}- Lovely wedding.|- Yes.
{40801}{40877}I was at school with his brother Bufty.|Tremendous bloke.
{40879}{40947}He was head of my house.|Buggered me senseless.
{40949}{41004}Still, it taught me about life.
{41029}{41091}Where do you know him from?
{41094}{41167}- University.|- Splendid.
{41169}{41217}Splendid. Yep.
{41237}{41301}I didn't go myself. I couldn't see the point.
{41304}{41391}When you work in the money markets,|what use is Wordsworth, eh?
{41399}{41487}Excuse me, sir. Your wife says|could you come upstairs at once?
{41489}{41549}Room 1 2, in case you're so drunk|you can't remember.
{41551}{41607}- My wife?|- Yes, sir.
{41617}{41679}My wife!
{41681}{41761}God! You are drunk if you can't|remember you've got a wife.
{41764}{41809}Yeah...
{41824}{41924}- Do you mind if l...|- No, no. Off you go. Best of luck.
{41927}{42019}Lucky bachelor, me. I'll have another|search for that Katie creature.
{42021}{42099}- Carrie.|- That's the one. Damn fine filly.
{42119}{42169}I think l'm in there.
{42559}{42604}- Hi.|- Hello.
{42607}{42684}- Sorry about that.|- He was hard to get rid of.
{42687}{42737}Yeah.
{42739}{42764}So...
{42934}{43089}Maybe we could just skulk around here|for a bit and then go back down.
{43124}{43184}That's a thought. I don't usually skulk,
{43187}{43279}but I suppose I could skulk|if skulking were required.
{43281}{43341}Do you skulk regularly?
{43361}{43517}No. No, I don't normally think of myself|as a skulker but...
{43591}{43751}Well, why don't you come in|and skulk for a while and we'll see?
{43941}{44067}I noticed the bride and groom didn't kiss|in the church, which is kind of strange.
{44069}{44139}Where I come from, kissing is very big.
{44154}{44259}Is it? Well, I think you're right.|We are probably more reserved.
{44261}{44339}'You may kiss the bride' isn't|actually in the Book of Common Prayer.
{44341}{44434}I always worry l'll go too far|in the heat of the moment.
{44517}{44577}How far do you think too far would be?
{44579}{44637}I don't know.
{44669}{44711}Maybe
{44757}{44817}that would be all right.
{44819}{44931}- I think that would be fine.|- In fact, it might be a bit dismissive.
{44967}{45017}Maybe this
{45044}{45099}might be better.
{45149}{45249}Yeah, I think it would be dangerous|to take it any further.
{45269}{45319}I mean...
{45609}{45674}That might be taking it a little far.
{45821}{45857}What about this?
{45859}{45979}Do you think the vicar would think things|had slipped a little out of his control?
{45981}{46121}I think he might. This kind of thing|is really better suited to the honeymoon
{46124}{46184}than to the service itself.
{46187}{46257}Why do you think|it's called a honeymoon?
{46279}{46411}I don't know. I suppose it's 'honey'|cos it's sweet as honey
{46414}{46514}and 'moon' because it was the first time
{46541}{46631}a husband got to see his wife's bottom.
{47594}{47644}What's happening?
{47681}{47731}I have to go.
{47764}{47834}- Where?|- America.
{47877}{47927}That is a tragedy.
{47954}{48009}Just before I go,
{48009}{48114}when were you thinking of|announcing the engagement?
{48174}{48234}Sorry. Whose engagement?
{48259}{48297}Ours.
{48299}{48409}I assumed since we slept together|and everything, we'd be getting married.
{48421}{48471}What did you think?
{48544}{48594}I...
{48634}{48807}Gosh! You know, that takes a lot|of thinking about, that kind of thing.
{48809}{48869}Obviously, l'm... I...
{48927}{48977}You're joking.
{49051}{49137}God! For a moment there|I thought I was in Fatal Attraction.
{49139}{49254}You were Glenn Close and I was|gonna find my pet rabbit on the stove.
{49281}{49331}No.
{49364}{49464}But I think we both missed|a great opportunity here.
{49584}{49634}Bye.
{50154}{50229}Three months later
{50241}{50301}Oh, fuck!
{50381}{50407}Fuck!
{50444}{50494}Fuckity fuck!
{50501}{50537}Fuck!
{50541}{50619}- Car or taxi?|- Taxi. We could never park.
{50821}{50881}Car seems a good idea.
{50907}{50957}- Fuck!|- Fuck!
{51209}{51261}Leave it. No one will notice.
{51854}{51909}Sorry l'm late. Traffic.
{51969}{52041}Yeah... Who is it today?
{52794}{52844}One more, please.
{54147}{54261}In the name of the Father|and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
{54264}{54311}Amen.
{54331}{54379}Let us pray.
{54381}{54494}Father, you have made|the bond of marriage a holy mystery,
{54509}{54599}a symbol of Christ's love for his church.
{54601}{54814}Hear our prayers for Bernard and Lydia|through your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord,
{54817}{54909}who lives and reigns|with you and the Holy Goat...
{54934}{54971}Ghost.
{54987}{55051}One God, for ever and ever.
{55064}{55097}Amen.
{55099}{55161}It's his first time. He's a family friend.
{55194}{55239}Bernard and Lydia,
{55241}{55359}I shall now ask if you freely undertake|the obligations of marriage.
{55361}{55434}Bernard, repeat after me.
{55434}{55541}- I do solemnly declare...|- I do solemnly declare...
{55544}{55609}that I know not|of any lawful impediment...
{55614}{55689}that I know not|of any lawful impediment...
{55691}{55737}why l, Lydia...

{56381}{56497}may not be joined in matrimony|to Lydia Jane Hibbott.
{56541}{56617}Lydia, repeat after me.
{56639}{56719}- I do solemnly declare...|- I do solemnly declare...
{56721}{56779}that I know not|of any lawful impediment...
{56787}{56867}that I know not|of any lawful impediment...
{56869}{56961}why l, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

{58344}{58417}to be my lawful wedded wife.
{58419}{58469}That's ri... That's right.
{58471}{58534}May Almighty God bless you all.
{58534}{58627}The Father, the Son,|and the Holy Spigot... Spirit.
{58629}{58654}Amen.
{58657}{58707}Bravo!
{59217}{59247}Thanks.
{59249}{59299}Coming, Bernie!
{59317}{59341}Sorry.
{59359}{59404}Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
{59409}{59451}That way?
{59454}{59517}Sorry. Could you two...? Sorry.
{59534}{59574}Sorry!
{59961}{60019}I've got a new theory about marriage.
{60034}{60177}Two people are in love, they live together,|and one day they run out of conversation.
{60179}{60277}Totally. They can't think of a single thing|to say to each other.
{60279}{60329}That's it. Panic.
{60331}{60479}Then suddenly, it occurs to the chap|that there is a way out of the deadlock.
{60517}{60589}- Which is?|- He'll ask her to marry him.
{60591}{60639}Brilliant!
{60641}{60751}They've got something to talk about|for the rest of their lives.
{60754}{60844}So it's just a way out of|an embarrassing pause in conversation.
{60844}{60909}The definitive icebreaker.
{60909}{61014}- Tom! How's the speech coming along?|- It's pretty good, I think.
{61017}{61097}Something for everyone. Tears, laughter...
{61137}{61219}- Excellent.|- It's a very good theory, Gareth.
{61221}{61341}There is another argument, of course,|that it has something to do with true love.
{61344}{61394}Well, there's a thought.
{61494}{61594}- Can I help you, sir?|- Can I have three brandies, please?
{61597}{61631}Hi.
{61669}{61697}Hello!
{61699}{61761}- How are you?|- Fine!
{61794}{61864}Sorry. I'm overwhelmed to see you.
{61911}{61977}Look, don't go back to America. Please.
{61979}{62049}- I'll be back in two secs, OK?|- OK.
{62094}{62129}Hi, Fi.
{62149}{62197}Those are yours. See you in five hours.
{62199}{62299}- Something happened?|- It has. This is a bloody great wedding.
{62429}{62461}Hi.
{62464}{62559}Well, you look perfect.|In fact, you probably are perfect.
{62561}{62629}- How are you?|- I'm really well.
{62631}{62717}Charles, l'd like you|to meet Hamish, my fiancé.
{62789}{62864}Excellent.
{62864}{62934}How do you do, Hamish?|Delighted to meet you.
{62937}{62991}Charming surprise to find Carrie back.
{62994}{63044}Took a lot of persuading, I can tell you.
{63047}{63107}Darling, I told James|I was going to get you.
{63109}{63184}He'll think l've totally|lost control of you already.
{63187}{63241}I'll see you later.
{63454}{63514}How are you doing, Charles?
{63534}{63597}Not great, actually, suddenly.
{63669}{63719}I don't know...
{63741}{63844}I mean, what the hell's going on here?
{63847}{63959}Why am I always at weddings|and never actually getting married, Matt?
{63961}{64034}It's probably because you're a bit scruffy.
{64079}{64159}Or it could also be|cos you haven't met the right girl.
{64159}{64217}But you see, is that it?
{64219}{64354}Maybe I have met the right girls.|Maybe I meet the right girls all the time.
{64354}{64409}- Maybe it's me.|- Nonsense.
{64411}{64534}My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,|dinner is served.
{64561}{64634}Come on. Odds on,|you meet your wife at dinner.
{64667}{64711}Yes.
{64959}{65007}Oh, my God!
{65079}{65129}Charles?
{65297}{65351}- Hi.|- Hello. I'm Alistair.
{65354}{65379}Great.
{65381}{65461}- I believe you know Veronica.|- Yeah. Hi, Vee. Hi.
{65464}{65514}Nicki.
{65559}{65609}Great.
{65729}{65791}Tell me, are you married?
{65804}{65834}No.
{65837}{65909}- Are you a lesbian?|- Good Lord!
{65944}{65991}What made you say that?
{65994}{66064}It's one of the possibilities|for unmarried girls.
{66064}{66181}It is a bit more interesting than saying|'just never found the right chap'.
{66189}{66284}- Quite right. Why be dull?|- Thank you.
{66384}{66494}The truth is, I have met the right person,|only he's not in love with me.
{66497}{66581}And until I stop loving him|no one else stands a chance.
{66584}{66644}- Bad luck.|- Yes, isn't it?
{66697}{66777}I was a lesbian once at school,|but only for 1 5 minutes.
{66779}{66834}I don't think it counts.
{67004}{67064}There are 400 different kinds of tea,
{67069}{67154}and that's not including|all these so-called fruit teas.
{67157}{67251}I took Veronica out to lndia at Christmas|to look at the plantations.
{67254}{67324}- You and her went there once.|- That's right.
{67327}{67431}Charles was vile. He insisted on|cracking jokes all the time I was ill.
{67444}{67514}- Trying to cheer you up.|- You're that Veronica!
{67514}{67581}Which Veronica? Charlie?
{67584}{67654}- Remember Bombay?|- When Charles and I were going out,
{67657}{67749}he told me he'd had this|interesting journey round lndia
{67751}{67834}with Vomiting Veronica.|I think that was it.
{67837}{67914}I don't remember ever mentioning it.|Maybe I did.
{67919}{68019}Come on, Charles. I don't think l've|ever been out with anyone less discreet.
{68021}{68119}- That's a bit of an exaggeration, isn't it?|- It is not.
{68121}{68194}I remember you going on|about this girl Helena
{68197}{68277}- whose mother made a pass at you.|- I remember this.
{68279}{68381}You couldn't work out whether it would|be impolite not to accept her advances.
{68384}{68459}That's right. Mrs Piggy.|Helena was Miss Piggy,
{68461}{68524}so her mother was Mrs Piggy!
{68534}{68589}I think perhaps it was a...
{68591}{68659}We've both lost a lot of weight since then.
{68819}{68881}Great! The speeches.
{68884}{69011}My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,|pray silence for the best man.
{69309}{69401}When Bernard told me|he was getting engaged to Lydia,
{69404}{69527}I congratulated him because all his other|girlfriends were such complete dogs.
{69589}{69684}Although may I say how delighted we are|to have so many of them here today.
{69754}{69874}I'm particularly delighted to see Camilla,|who many of you will remember
{69877}{69994}as the first person|Bernard asked to marry him.
{69997}{70081}If I remember rightly,|she told him to sod off.
{70174}{70221}And lucky for Lydia that she did.
{70359}{70407}It's very disappointing.
{70514}{70597}We had the most adorable girl|at our table called Carrie.
{70599}{70699}Apparently her fiancé's awfully grand|and he owns half of Scotland.
{70701}{70781}- How are you?|- I'm stuck in the wedding from hell.
{70784}{70849}Ghosts of girlfriends past at every turn.
{70851}{70914}If I meet Henrietta,|the horror will be complete.
{70917}{70951}Hello, Charles.
{70971}{71021}Hello, Hen. How are you?
{71057}{71081}Hen...
{71084}{71174}Why can't you leave her alone?|Haven't you hurt her enough?
{71264}{71354}Excuse me. I think l'd better be|where other people are not.
{71539}{71561}Hello.
{71574}{71709}I'm S-e-r-e-n-a.
{71709}{71754}Hello.
{71797}{71859}I'm just learning.
{71924}{72044}I'm probably naking tols of nistakes.
{72111}{72217}No - perfect. Perfect.
{72271}{72337}Would you like to dance?
{72357}{72441}That would be... mice.
{73207}{73247}Taxi!
{73437}{73474}Good night, sir.
{74434}{74519}It's all right. Oh, God! This is wonderful.
{74971}{75069}Wait a minute. This is no fun.|I want to see my lovely husband.
{75637}{75761}Who's a very bad bridegroom indeed?
{76127}{76187}- Have you got a boyfriend?|- Yes.
{76189}{76277}- What's his name?|- Dolph. He's good at table tennis.
{76279}{76347}- What about you?|- No. Afraid not.
{76371}{76421}Why not?
{76424}{76479}Don't know.
{76494}{76619}Because most of the blokes I fancy|think l'm stupid and pointless,
{76621}{76689}so they just bonk me and then leave me,
{76691}{76787}and the kind of blokes that do fancy me,|I think are drips.
{76789}{76851}I can't even be bothered to bonk them,
{76854}{76929}which does sort of leave me|a bit nowhere.
{76944}{77004}What's bonking?
{77039}{77187}Well, it's kind of like table tennis,|only with slightly smaller balls.
{77729}{77781}So good!
{78069}{78187}- I love my wife!|- And I love my husband!
{78269}{78367}- Do you think we'd better get back?|- We could just wait a few minutes
{78369}{78417}and have another go.
{78471}{78517}Naughty little rabbit!
{78659}{78707}Found it.
{78817}{78877}Charles! Charles, we must talk.
{78934}{78969}Right.
{78971}{79071}The thing is, Charlie,|l've spoken to lots of people about you.
{79074}{79167}Everybody agrees|you're in real trouble, Charles.
{79169}{79194}Am l?
{79197}{79301}You see, you're turning into|a kind of serial monogamist.
{79304}{79411}One girlfriend after another,|yet you never really let anyone near you.
{79414}{79461}On the contrary...
{79464}{79539}You're affectionate to them|and sweet to them.
{79541}{79601}Even to me,|although you thought I was an idiot.
{79604}{79654}- I did not.|- You did.
{79657}{79734}- I thought U2 was a type of submarine.|- In a way, you were right.
{79737}{79819}- Their music has a naval quality.|- Be serious, Charles.
{79821}{79911}Give people a chance. You don't|have to think 'l must get married',
{79914}{80009}but you mustn't start relationships|thinking 'l mustn't get married'.
{80009}{80111}Most of the time I don't think at all.|I just potter along.
{80114}{80147}Charlie!
{80149}{80234}Oh, God! The way you used to look at me!
{80237}{80294}I just misread it, that's all.
{80297}{80359}I thought you were going to propose
{80361}{80424}and you were just working out|how to leave.
{80427}{80521}- No, I wasn't.|- Oh, God, this is ridiculous.
{80551}{80601}Hen...
{80629}{80709}- Having a good night?|- Yes.
{80711}{80834}It's right up there with my father's|funeral for sheer entertainment value.
{80834}{80929}- I thought you'd gone.|- No. Hamish took the Edinburgh sleeper.
{80931}{80991}I'm off now. Keep me company?
{81341}{81391}Here, please.
{81411}{81471}You want to come up for a nightcap?
{81521}{81604}- You sure?|- Well, yes. I think we can risk it.
{81607}{81699}I'm pretty sure I can resist you.|You're not that cute.
{81714}{81767}Sorry... Yeah, great.
{83537}{83614}Morning, Charles. Breakfast's up.
{83617}{83727}One month later
{83769}{83827}What are you up to today?
{83829}{83871}Oh, yeah...
{83894}{84009}I'm taking advantage of the fact that,|for the first time in my entire life,
{84011}{84091}it's Saturday|and I don't have a wedding to go to.
{84094}{84151}All I have to do is not be late for David.
{84151}{84201}I was going to go for a job.
{84204}{84321}This new shop called Spank wants|a sales assistant. I think l'd be great.
{84324}{84409}- They sell all this funny rubber stuff.|- No...
{84411}{84537}Another wedding invitation,|and a list. Lovely!
{84539}{84601}They say rubber's mainly for perverts.
{84604}{84687}Don't know why.|I think it's very practical, actually.
{84687}{84757}You spill anything on it|and it just comes off.
{84757}{84824}That could be why the perverts like it.
{84827}{84881}You all right?
{84907}{84957}Yeah.
{84971}{85077}It's that girl Carrie.|You remember, the...
{85079}{85134}The American.
{85379}{85439}Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.
{85441}{85519}- Do you have the wedding list for Banks?|- Certainly, sir.
{85521}{85609}Lots of beautiful things|for around about the £1 ,000 mark.
{85649}{85751}What about things around|the sort of £50 mark? ls there much?
{85774}{85861}Well, you could get|that Pygmy warrior over there.
{85879}{85929}This? Excellent!
{85931}{86021}If you could find someone|to chip in the other 3,950.
{86024}{86087}Or our carrier bags are £1 .50 each.
{86087}{86147}Why don't you just get 33 of them?
{86199}{86267}Well, I think l'll probably leave it.
{86269}{86344}Thanks very much. You've been very...
{86361}{86437}- What did you get?|- Blimey!
{86439}{86499}Well, I never!
{86501}{86577}Nothing yet. I'm just, you know, deciding.
{86577}{86654}- It's nice to see you.|- It's nice to see you.
{86679}{86787}This present thing is great.|I should've gotten married years ago.
{86789}{86861}- Anybody get the Pygmy?|- The young man thought about it...
{86891}{86927}No!
{86927}{86991}Just get me an ashtray.
{87021}{87084}Are you free for about a half-hour?
{87087}{87121}Yeah.
{87121}{87201}I'm meeting my brother,|but I can be a bit late.
{87201}{87284}Oh, good. You have|an important decision to make.
{87287}{87374}- Now, you mustn't laugh.|- OK. Right.
{87549}{87621}What do you think?
{87661}{87701}Divine.
{87704}{87774}Bit of a meringue?
{87807}{87864}Don't worry. We've only just begun.
{87934}{87994}What do you think?
{88019}{88079}- You're kidding.|- But it would be wonderful.
{88081}{88144}Maybe next time.
{88184}{88244}What do you think?
{88339}{88421}- I knew it.|- With a staff, you could look after sheep.
{88431}{88469}Don't be rude.
{88494}{88544}It's a bit sexy, this.
{88577}{88621}Well...
{88621}{88701}If I were your husband,|I would die of pride.
{88701}{88751}You may be right. It is dangerous.
{88754}{88849}There's nothing worse at a wedding|than a priest with an erection.
{88981}{89057}It's strange thinking|you'll never sleep with anyone else.
{89059}{89169}- You don't think you'll be unfaithful?|- No. Not once l'm married.
{89171}{89257}I told Hamish l'll kill him if he does,|so l'd better stick to that.
{89259}{89294}Quite right.
{89297}{89371}Anyway, I reckon l've had my fair run at it.
{89387}{89474}What is a fair run these days,|down your way?
{89477}{89537}I don't know.
{89539}{89589}More than one.
{89591}{89647}Well, come on. Tell me.
{89671}{89741}I've seen the dress. We have no secrets.
{89839}{89889}Well...
{89909}{90039}The first one - of course,|not easily forgotten - was kinda nice.
{90067}{90131}Two... hairy back.
{90164}{90307}Three, four, five... Six was|on my birthday in my parents' room.
{90314}{90369}- Which birthday?|- 17th.
{90371}{90444}- We've only reached 17?|- I grew up in the country.
{90447}{90509}Lots of rolling around in haystacks.
{90521}{90597}OK. Seven...
{90599}{90674}Eight, unfortunately, was quite a shock.
{90699}{90791}Nine, against a fence.|Very uncomfortable. Don't try it.
{90794}{90819}I won't.
{90821}{90909}10 was gorgeous. Just heaven, just...
{90941}{91024}- He was wonderful.|- I hate him.
{91051}{91127}1 1 , obviously after 10, disappointing.
{91127}{91247}1 2 through 17, the university years.|Sensitive, caring, intelligent boys.
{91247}{91317}Sexually speaking, a real low patch.
{91357}{91414}18 broke my heart.
{91417}{91479}- Years of yearning.|- I'm sorry.
{91481}{91557}20... Oh, my God!|I can't believe l've reached 20.
{91584}{91651}21 , elephant tongue.
{91689}{91779}22 kept falling asleep.|That was my first year in England.
{91791}{91817}I do apologise.
{91817}{91891}- 23 and 24 together. That was something.|- Seriously?
{91894}{91949}27... That was a mistake.
{91977}{92071}- Suddenly at 27 you make a mistake?|- Yes, he kept screaming.
{92074}{92151}Very off-putting.|I nearly gave up on the whole thing.
{92151}{92219}But Spencer changed my mind. That's 28.
{92221}{92294}- His father, 29.|- With his father?
{92304}{92344}30.
{92369}{92419}31 ... Oh, my God.
{92439}{92517}32 was lovely.
{92551}{92637}And then my fiancé, that's 33.
{92664}{92721}Wow!
{92724}{92811}So I came after your fiancé?
{92821}{92881}No, you were 32.
{92927}{92971}So there you go.
{92971}{93064}Less than Madonna,|more than Princess Di - I hope.
{93077}{93139}And how about you?|How many have you slept with?
{93141}{93217}Christ! Nothing like that many.|I don't know...
{93217}{93291}I don't know what the fuck|l've been doing with my time.
{93294}{93401}Work, probably. Yeah, work.|I have been working late a lot.
{93591}{93651}I wish l'd rung you.
{93694}{93754}But then you never rang me.
{93777}{93869}You ruthlessly slept with me twice|and never rang me.
{93981}{94029}Bollocks!
{94031}{94087}Help me, please! Please!
{94261}{94347}You're no longer my brother,|you're just some git I once met.
{94354}{94391}I'm sorry.
{94391}{94461}Carrie, this is David, my brother.
{94464}{94514}This is Carrie.
{94541}{94577}Hi.
{94591}{94649}We were buying her a wedding dress.
{94667}{94724}Pathetic excuse. Who's she marrying?
{94749}{94797}Some total penis.
{94811}{94897}What is it about penises|that they get such great wives?
{94919}{94997}I was just telling him|about you marrying Hamish
{94999}{95089}and he said it couldn't have happened|to a nicer fellow.
{95109}{95171}Didn't you do it with her once?
{95174}{95234}- Where are you doing it?|- Scotland.
{95257}{95297}Yes.
{95304}{95357}Beautiful breasts.
{95357}{95431}He says that's a beautiful place. Hilly.
{95457}{95511}You should come to the wedding, too.
{95514}{95641}I want lots of friends to make up for|the gruesome stiffs that Hamish knows.
{95661}{95717}Well, you'd better go in.
{95727}{95751}Bye.
{95761}{95817}- Bye.|- Bye.
{95934}{95981}Come on - we're late.
{96064}{96114}Fuck it!
{96419}{96497}Look. Sorry.
{96497}{96584}I just... Well...|This is a really stupid question,
{96587}{96657}particularly in view|of our shopping excursion,
{96657}{96744}but I just wondered if by any chance...
{96794}{96874}Obviously not, because|l've only slept with nine people.
{96877}{96931}But l... I just wondered...
{96934}{96997}I really feel...
{96997}{97104}In short, to recap|in a slightly clearer version,
{97107}{97219}in the words of David Cassidy,|while still with the Partridge Family,
{97221}{97297}I think I love you. And...
{97299}{97419}I just wondered whether|by any chance you wouldn't like to...
{97491}{97567}No. No, of course not.
{97601}{97659}I'm an idiot. He's not.
{97661}{97711}Excellent. Fantastic.
{97714}{97794}Lovely to see you.|Sorry to disturb. Better get on.
{97804}{97881}- Fuck!|- That was very romantic.
{97959}{98064}Well, I thought it over a lot, you know.|I wanted to get it just right.
{98101}{98169}Important to have said it, I think.
{98171}{98229}Said what, exactly?
{98277}{98431}Said, you know, what I just said|about David Cassidy.
{98541}{98611}You're lovely.
{99289}{99379}One month later
{99861}{99977}It was ordained for lifelong faithful|relationships and conjugal love.
{99977}{100047}It was ordained|for the welfare of human society,
{100049}{100099}which can be strong and happy
{100101}{100177}only when the marriage bond|is held in honour.
{100199}{100317}Into this holy estate|these two persons now desire to enter.
{100339}{100414}Wherefore, if anyone can show|any just cause
{100417}{100501}why they may not lawfully|be joined together in marriage,
{100504}{100554}Iet him now declare it.
{100659}{100701}Sorry.
{100701}{100751}Please rise.
{100821}{100941}Do you, Hamish, take this woman|Caroline to be your wedded wife
{100944}{101041}and do you, in the presence of God|and before this congregation,
{101044}{101149}promise and covenant to be to her|a loving and faithful husband
{101151}{101221}until God shall separate you by death?
{101224}{101271}I do.
{101274}{101381}Do you, Caroline, take this man Hamish|to be your wedded husband
{101381}{101477}and do you, in the presence of God|and before this congregation,
{101479}{101567}promise and covenant to be to him|a loving and faithful wife
{101569}{101631}until God shall separate you by death?
{101631}{101659}I do.
{101719}{101769}Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
{102374}{102454}- How awfully nice to meet you.|- Nice to meet you.
{102517}{102567}Hello.
{102604}{102671}You look beautiful.|Not a meringue in sight.
{102674}{102714}Thanks.
{102849}{102899}Blimey!
{102917}{102994}It's Brigadoon! lt's bloody Brigadoon!
{103254}{103339}Dear old things, as you know,|l've always been proud
{103341}{103424}that there's not a wedding ring|between the lot of us.
{103427}{103514}Over the passing of the years,|it's beginning to distress me.
{103517}{103611}I'd like to go to the wedding|of someone I really loved for a change.
{103614}{103691}Don't blame me.|I've asked practically everyone I know.
{103694}{103759}- You haven't asked me.|- Haven't l?
{103761}{103837}Oh, Scarlett... Would you like to?
{103839}{103904}No, thank you.|It was very nice of you to ask.
{103907}{103951}Well... Any time.
{103951}{104024}Quite right, Tom, quite right.|That's the spirit.
{104027}{104097}Tonight, these are your orders.
{104099}{104199}Go forth and conjugate.|Find husbands and wives.
{104201}{104287}Excellent. What do you think, Fifi?|Spot a potential hubby?
{104289}{104347}- Bugger off, Tom.|- Quite right.
{104347}{104414}A toast before we go into battle.
{104451}{104494}True love.
{104497}{104557}In whatever shape or form it may come.
{104557}{104684}May we all in our dotage be proud to say|'l was adored once, too.'
{104711}{104777}- True love.|- True love!
{104977}{105051}Apparently, an enormous|number of people
{105051}{105134}actually bump into|their future spouses at weddings,
{105137}{105187}which is interesting.
{105187}{105249}Yes, I met my husband at a wedding.
{105447}{105561}Good Lord, I seem to have finished|my drink. If you'll excuse me.
{105671}{105737}Hello. My name's Scarlett.
{105739}{105814}Named after Scarlett O'Hara,|but much less trouble.
{105817}{105889}- What's your name?|- My name's Rhett.
{105891}{105927}No...
{105929}{105987}- Not really?|- No, not really.
{105987}{106061}- In fact, it's Chester.|- You kidder!
{106091}{106171}I always imagine Americans|are gonna be dull as shit.
{106174}{106224}Of course you're not, are you?
{106227}{106291}Steve Martin's American, isn't he?
{106309}{106357}Yes, he is.
{106359}{106409}You're lovely.
{106627}{106687}Hello, Charles.
{106689}{106751}Oh, Hen. Hi.
{106754}{106817}Look, I couldn't really bear a scene today.
{106819}{106887}I know we've probably|got tons to talk about...
{106889}{106957}Did I behave that atrociously last time?
{106977}{107047}Well, you remember|the shower scene in Psycho?
{107059}{107109}Scarier.
{107129}{107181}God, l'm depressed, Hen! How are you?
{107181}{107311}I'm cheerful. I weigh almost nothing|and l've got a divine new boyfriend.
{107367}{107411}Perhaps we should've got married.
{107414}{107534}No! l'd have had to marry your friends,|and l'm not sure I could take Fiona.
{107537}{107577}Fiona loves you.
{107577}{107674}- Fiona calls me Duckface.|- Well, I never heard that.
{107677}{107759}Look, darling, come to lunch soon.|Give me a ring.
{107761}{107811}Still cute.
{107911}{107961}How's Duckface?
{107964}{108019}Good form, actually. Not too mad.
{108054}{108164}Ladies and gentlemen,|the bride and groom!
{109069}{109129}You like this girl, don't you?
{109189}{109239}Yes.
{109297}{109347}Yes, it's...
{109367}{109441}It's a strange thing|when at last it happens.
{109444}{109557}And she's marrying someone else.
{109751}{109857}How about you, Fifi? Have you|identified a future partner for life yet?
{109879}{109929}No need, really.
{109961}{110017}The deed is done.
{110019}{110097}I've been in love|with the same bloke for ages.
{110111}{110181}Have you? Who's that?
{110217}{110277}You, Charlie.
{110714}{110771}It's always been you.
{110797}{110901}Since first we met so many years ago.
{110951}{111007}I knew the first moment.
{111009}{111081}Across a crowded room. A lawn, in fact.
{111219}{111274}Doesn't matter.
{111299}{111389}Nothing either of us can do|on this one. Such is life.
{111507}{111581}Friends isn't bad, you know.
{111584}{111641}Friends is quite something.
{111687}{111737}Oh, Fi...
{111999}{112059}It's not all easy, is it?
{112077}{112127}No.
{112171}{112239}Just forget this business. Not to be.
{112324}{112377}Matthew, darling.
{112379}{112459}- Where's Gareth?|- Torturing Americans.
{112477}{112531}How thoughtful of him.
{112607}{112679}Do you actually know Oscar Wilde?
{112681}{112751}Not personally, no.
{112761}{112874}But I do know someone|who could get his fax number for you.
{112884}{112934}Shall we dance?
{114017}{114081}Well? Any rings on fingers?
{114081}{114137}Gareth, you don't know|how lucky you are.
{114137}{114204}Finding someone to marry|is a tricky business.
{114207}{114319}It's hell out there. Matthew's trapped|with an evangelist from Minnesota.
{114321}{114377}Sweet Jesus, cast out the devil!
{114391}{114517}My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,|please charge your glasses.
{114519}{114617}First, and rather unusually,|we have the bride.
{114661}{114721}Excellent. I love this girl.
{114739}{114789}Thank you.
{114791}{114911}First of all, l'd like to thank all of you|who've flown in from the States.
{114924}{115037}As for the rest of you, l'd have thought|that lots of frightful Americans flying in
{115039}{115117}was an excuse for staying away.|So I thank you, too.
{115211}{115327}If my darling dad had been here today,|he would have been speaking now,
{115327}{115379}and I know what he would have said:
{115381}{115527}'Great dress, babe, but why in the hell|are you marrying the stiff in the skirt?'
{115587}{115681}And I would have given him|the same answer that I give you:
{115684}{115734}'Because I love him.'
{115737}{115824}As John Lennon said,|who died the same year as my dad,
{115827}{115919}'Love is the answer,|and you know that for sure.'
{116044}{116107}And one more thing.
{116109}{116217}Someone told me here that, if things with|Hamish didn't work out, he would step in.
{116219}{116301}I just wanted to say thanks,|and l'll keep you posted.
{116419}{116444}Bravo!
{116447}{116541}Now, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,|Sir Hamish Banks.
{116697}{116764}Anyone involved in politics|for the last 20 years
{116767}{116841}has got used to being|upstaged by a woman.
{116874}{116951}I didn't expect it to happen to me|on my wedding day.
{116954}{117049}However, I must also say|that l'm quite happy
{117051}{117141}to be upstaged by this woman|for the rest of my life.
{117144}{117251}Is that some barracking at the back?|We politicians are used to that.
{117254}{117327}- Shit! Find a doctor!|- Right. OK.
{117327}{117397}First of all,|my compliments to the bridesmaids.
{117399}{117457}You did your duties superbly.
{117459}{117567}And obviously I intend to use you|every time I get married from now on.
{117711}{117804}I want to thank|all those wonderful ladies of the parish
{117807}{117859}who did the flowers in the church.
{117861}{117964}The stern old building took on|a look of flushed youth today.
{118167}{118254}I remember the first time|I laid eyes on Caroline.
{118257}{118374}I thought to myself:|'lf by any chance she's short-sighted,
{118377}{118459}I might just be happy|for the rest of my life.'
{118487}{118557}I thought I could see my future|for the first time.
{118559}{118689}It was a joyful one,|for years and years to come.
{120879}{120984}Good morning, and a warm welcome|to you all on this cold day.
{120994}{121059}Our service will begin in a few minutes.
{121061}{121174}But first we have asked Matthew,|Gareth's closest friend,
{121177}{121241}to say a few words.
{121441}{121521}Gareth used to prefer funerals|to weddings.
{121521}{121591}He said it was easier to get enthusiastic
{121591}{121714}about a ceremony one had an outside|chance of eventually being involved in.
{121757}{121834}In order to prepare this speech,|I rang a few people
{121837}{121951}to get a general picture of how Gareth|was regarded by those who met him.
{121987}{122081}'Fat' seems to have been a word|people most connected with him.
{122131}{122207}'Terribly rude' also rang a lot of bells.
{122247}{122391}So 'very fat' and 'very rude' seems|to have been the stranger's viewpoint.
{122391}{122484}But some of you have rung me|and let me know that you loved him,
{122489}{122577}which I know he would have been|thrilled to hear.
{122577}{122707}You remember his fabulous hospitality,|his strange experimental cooking.
{122761}{122881}The recipe for duck á la banana|fortunately goes with him to his grave.
{122917}{123041}Most of all, you tell me of|his enormous capacity for joy.
{123047}{123174}And, when joyful,|for highly vocal drunkenness.
{123251}{123331}I hope joyful is how|you will remember him.
{123381}{123451}Not stuck in a box in a church.
{123527}{123634}Pick your favourite of his waistcoats|and remember him that way.
{123637}{123731}The most splendid, replete,
{123759}{123834}big-hearted
{123847}{123911}- weak-hearted, as it turned out -
{123914}{123989}and jolly bugger most of us ever met.
{124061}{124139}As for me, you may ask|how I will remember him.
{124174}{124234}What I thought of him.
{124331}{124407}Unfortunately, there I run out of words.
{124484}{124539}Forgive me|if I turn from my own feelings
{124541}{124671}to the words of another|splendid bugger, WH Auden.
{124689}{124751}This is actually what I want to say:
{124829}{124914}Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
{124957}{125037}Prevent the dog from barking|with a juicy bone,
{125087}{125164}Silence the pianos|and with muffled drum
{125167}{125277}Bring out the coffin,|let the mourners come.
{125314}{125381}Let the aeroplanes circle|moaning overhead
{125381}{125487}Scribbling on the sky the message|He ls Dead.
{125534}{125621}Put crepe bows round the white necks|of the public doves,
{125671}{125757}Let traffic policemen|wear black cotton gloves.
{125797}{125897}He was my North, my South,|my East and West.
{125931}{126011}My working week and my Sunday rest,
{126051}{126151}My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
{126217}{126294}I thought that love would last for ever:
{126317}{126371}I was wrong.
{126449}{126504}The stars are not wanted now:
{126539}{126599}Put out every one;
{126627}{126701}Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;
{126767}{126837}Pour away the ocean|and sweep up the wood;
{126881}{126961}For nothing now|can ever come to any good.
{127849}{127967}It was good of you to come. Must have|been the shortest honeymoon in history.
{127967}{128029}No, it's fine. We'll do it some other time.
{128149}{128204}You know, what you said in the street...
{128207}{128287}- Yes, l'm sorry about that.|- No, I liked it.
{128289}{128357}I liked you saying it.
{128607}{128681}Charlie, l'll take Scarlett home, all right?
{128714}{128764}Darling Fi.
{128964}{129009}Walk, Charlie?
{129011}{129077}Yeah. Yeah, that would be grand.
{129159}{129247}Never felt like that.|I mean, something vaguely similar,
{129249}{129319}for Jilly, when I was young.
{129321}{129367}Jilly?
{129369}{129419}Labrador.
{129451}{129509}Yes, it's odd, isn't it?
{129511}{129574}All these years|we've been single and proud of it
{129577}{129691}and never noticed that two of us were,|in effect, married all this time.
{129694}{129751}Traitors in our midst.
{129841}{129939}You know, I think death is hardest|for the parents, don't you?
{129941}{129999}I hope I die before my children.
{130001}{130037}Tom...
{130037}{130109}There's one thing I find really...
{130187}{130279}Well... It's your total confidence|that you will get married.
{130281}{130379}I mean, what if|you never find the right girl?
{130381}{130407}Sorry?
{130409}{130491}Surely, if that service shows anything,
{130494}{130574}it shows that there is such a thing|as a perfect match.
{130577}{130699}If we can't be like Gareth and Matthew,|then maybe we should just let it go.
{130719}{130781}Some of us are not gonna get married.
{130784}{130844}Well, I don't know, Charlie.
{130861}{130977}The truth is, unlike you,|I never expected the thunderbolt.
{131001}{131091}I always just hoped that l'd meet|some nice, friendly girl,
{131094}{131209}Iike the look of her, hope the look of me|didn't make her physically sick,
{131211}{131324}then pop the question|and settle down and be happy.
{131361}{131451}It worked for my parents.|Well, apart from the divorce...
{131461}{131537}I'll give you six months|at the outside, Tom.
{131561}{131621}Yeah, maybe you're right.
{131634}{131797}Maybe all this waiting for|one true love stuff gets you nowhere.
{132201}{132281}What the fuck is going on?
{132361}{132454}I thought we'd better make|absolutely sure we weren't late.
{132467}{132509}Excellent wedding hairstyle.
{132564}{132597}Ten months later
{132599}{132687}Matthew.|The best-looking best man in the world.
{132701}{132807}Listen. Thank you for doing this today.
{132807}{132861}Of course.
{132917}{132991}I wish Gareth was here.
{132991}{133047}Bet he does, too.
{133107}{133194}I'm sorry we're so late.|The others are just parking the car.
{133197}{133247}I thought we'd all go with Tom.
{133249}{133341}- Late? So late?|- Yeah. It's 9.45.
{133344}{133454}- 9.45?|- Yep. 45 minutes till 'l do'.
{133457}{133541}Oh, bloody Tom!|I told him to set the alarm for eight!
{133544}{133594}Fuck it! Fuck!
{133697}{133764}- Scarlett.|- Hi!
{133767}{133851}- You ready?|- Absolutely. Give me 20 seconds.
{134089}{134127}- Time.|- Honestly?
{134129}{134157}Yes! Time!
{134159}{134207}It's about ten to nine.
{134647}{134697}Bastards.
{134749}{134817}Jessica, stop jumping|up and down, please.
{134901}{134967}One, two, three, smile!
{135041}{135157}- This is splendid tuck.|- Yes, I think I might say a little word.
{135159}{135274}As you know, l've been a close observer|of Charles's love life for many years.
{135277}{135397}But recently l'd started to despair and fear|that really he was married to us,
{135399}{135507}- except that we won't have his babies.|- I don't know about that.
{135507}{135594}But it's all turned out splendidly.|The girl is sadly crazy,
{135601}{135649}but perhaps that's why he loves her.
{135651}{135771}I'd like to propose a toast to my Charlie|and his beautiful girl on this tragic day.
{135771}{135861}- So, be happy and don't forget us.|- Thank you.
{135864}{135957}- To Charles and Duckface.|- Charles and Duckface!
{136107}{136164}- What do you think?|- You look divine.
{136167}{136227}It does work, doesn't it? Yes.
{136301}{136401}I'd like to thank Fiona for those|charming words about my future wife.
{136401}{136504}I'd like to take this opportunity|to read a message from her to you all.
{136507}{136547}This is exciting.
{136549}{136649}She says 'Any of you come near|the house, l'll set the dogs on you.'
{136651}{136717}I think that's a nice touch.
{136719}{136767}Sweet!
{136769}{136829}'Set the dogs on you'!
{136861}{136917}John, hi.
{136917}{136967}- John, you made it.|- Yes.
{136969}{137061}I hope me damn sister turns up.|Not much of a wedding without a bride.
{137061}{137101}Tom!
{137121}{137181}Bit of a poor show|you not having a stag night.
{137181}{137311}We did! We did... We didn't think it was|a very good idea in this day and age.
{137314}{137364}Really?
{137837}{137899}Fi, you do look lovely today.
{137901}{138029}- I've abandoned my traditional black.|- Yes, so you have.
{138031}{138101}From now on, I shall be|all the colours of the rainbow
{138104}{138207}and fall in love with someone|who fancies me for a change.
{138209}{138259}Darling Fi!
{138429}{138471}- Look.|- What?
{138471}{138541}Lipstick everywhere. That won't do at all.
{138621}{138671}- Hi.|- Hi.
{139061}{139111}Good luck.
{139231}{139294}Hello. Glad you could come.
{139329}{139384}Groom's on the right. Bride's on the left.
{139471}{139561}- Groom on the right. Bride on the left.|- Oh, my God!
{139664}{139731}I thought you'd gone back to Texas.
{139731}{139784}Without you, never.
{139891}{139941}Good luck.
{140031}{140081}Bride or groom?
{140134}{140184}Bride or groom?
{140189}{140301}It should be perfectly obvious l'm neither.|Great God!
{140327}{140391}- Bride or groom?|- Bride.
{140634}{140687}Yes...
{140687}{140729}I'm fine.
{140791}{140851}I've a feeling we've met before.
{140851}{140924}We have. About 25 years ago.
{140941}{141027}I'm second cousin Harold's|daughter Deirdre. You're Tom.
{141029}{141069}Good Lord!
{141071}{141129}- So, you're family.|- Yes.
{141149}{141249}- Only very distant.|- Well, yes, of course.
{141287}{141364}You said you were bride?
{141367}{141399}Yes.
{141401}{141451}Well, do sit.
{141459}{141519}Do sit here, Deirdre.
{141624}{141674}Golly!
{141687}{141731}Thunderbolt city.
{141757}{141817}- Hello, Matthew.|- Nice to see you.
{141819}{141891}- Hello, Charles.|- Bernard. How are you?
{141891}{141957}- Exhausted, actually.|- Oh, bunny!
{141959}{142009}- Charles.|- Hello, Lyd.
{142147}{142197}- Hi.|- Hi.
{142237}{142339}You look lovely. But then I always|did like you dressed for weddings.
{142347}{142437}- And on time.|- Yeah. Extraordinary thing, isn't it?
{142441}{142554}- How's Hamish?|- He's fine... I believe.
{142557}{142614}- You believe?|- Well, yes.
{142617}{142681}He wasn't the man for me after all.
{142747}{142817}- You left him?|- We left each other.
{142887}{142981}- When?|- A few months now.
{142984}{143071}March was hell. By April, it was sordid.
{143074}{143171}That's the last time|I marry someone three times my age.
{143174}{143239}Charles, time to travel.
{143241}{143291}Yeah.
{143334}{143389}Coming. Good.
{143467}{143581}- So why didn't you get in touch, then?|- I did think about it.
{143581}{143684}I wanted to, but I was in a state.
{143721}{143789}So, anyway, I don't want to keep you.
{143824}{143884}And l'll see you afterwards.
{143887}{143931}Yeah. Fine.
{143931}{143981}Wait.
{144091}{144141}I'll show you to your seat.
{144184}{144244}Just showing her to her seat.
{144544}{144607}Our timing's been really bad, hasn't it?
{144609}{144671}It's been bad, yes.
{144671}{144727}It's been a disaster.
{144729}{144844}It has, as you say,|been very bad indeed.
{144957}{145021}God, it's lovely to see you.
{145077}{145131}Well, good luck.
{145134}{145261}It's pretty easy. Just say 'l do'|whenever anyone asks you a question.
{145477}{145544}Could you just give me a sec, Matthew?
{145547}{145624}Yes, of course. Freshen up at will.
{146084}{146134}Dear Lord,
{146137}{146274}forgive me for what l'm about to say
{146277}{146387}in this magnificent place of worship.
{146389}{146434}Bugger!
{146464}{146514}Bugger!
{146667}{146721}Can I help at all?
{146741}{146797}No. Thanks.
{146797}{146827}Sorry.
{146859}{146921}Vocal exercises. Big church.
{146924}{146987}Excellent. Often do the same myself.
{146989}{147111}Not exactly the same vocab, obviously.|Rather more alleluias.
{147111}{147167}I'll leave you.
{147599}{147651}- Bride's arriving.|- Fabulous!
{147654}{147714}We seem to have lost the groom.
{147727}{147824}- Stall her and l'll see if I can find him.|- Roger. Wilco.
{148001}{148051}Charles.
{148084}{148144}It's good to see you.
{148197}{148254}Yeah.
{148297}{148377}Matt, what do we think about marriage?
{148397}{148477}Well... Gosh!
{148477}{148597}Well, I think it's really good,|if you love the person with all your heart.
{148631}{148711}Well, exactly. Quite.
{148791}{148889}All these weddings. All these years.
{148921}{149001}All that blasted salmon and champagne.
{149001}{149151}Here I am on my own wedding day|and l'm still thinking.
{149167}{149221}Can I ask about what?
{149291}{149339}No.
{149341}{149391}No, I think best not.
{149407}{149487}I'm sorry, there's a delay.|A problem with the flowers.
{149494}{149521}Flowers?
{149521}{149619}There seems to be a staggeringly|high proportion of hay fever sufferers
{149621}{149744}and they're right next to the flowers,|so we're moving the congregation.
{149747}{149804}Don't want the vows|obliterated by sneezing.
{149807}{149911}Charles, would it be out of place|for me to say that time is ticking by?
{149964}{150014}What's happening? Tell me.
{150124}{150169}Oh, God.
{150191}{150261}I just saw Carrie...|and she's separated.
{150287}{150344}Charles. It's your wedding day.
{150531}{150577}I've fooled them so far.
{150579}{150657}When people think you're stupid,|they're less suspicious.
{150661}{150704}What's your advice?
{150717}{150781}You've got three choices:|one - go ahead with it.
{150837}{150901}Two - go outside and say|'Sorry, folks, it's all off!'
{150921}{150971}Not tempting. Next?
{151001}{151041}Third...
{151091}{151141}I can't think of a third.
{151217}{151271}Hello.
{151271}{151311}Here you are!
{151314}{151369}Ready to face the enemy?
{151411}{151461}Are we?
{151544}{151594}Yes.
{151627}{151677}Excellent.
{152979}{153029}Not so tight, Dad.
{153717}{153827}Dearly beloved, we are gathered|together here in the sight of God
{153827}{153891}and in the face of this congregation
{153891}{153977}to join together this man|and this woman in holy matrimony,
{153979}{154117}which is an honourable estate, instituted|of God in the time of man's innocence,
{154119}{154251}signifying unto us the mystical union|that is betwixt Christ and his Church
{154264}{154339}and therefore is not|by any to be enterprised
{154341}{154431}nor taken in hand unadvisedly,|lightly, or wantonly,
{154434}{154517}but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,
{154519}{154557}soberly,
{154557}{154607}and in the fear of God.
{154624}{154689}Therefore, if any man|can show any just cause
{154691}{154757}why they may not|lawfully be joined together,
{154759}{154867}Iet him speak now or else hereafter|for ever hold his peace.
{154987}{155077}I'm sorry.|Does someone have something to say?
{155219}{155274}Yes? What is it?
{155321}{155359}One second.
{155361}{155399}What's going on?
{155441}{155491}I thought of a third option.
{155529}{155579}What?
{155589}{155654}Will you translate?
{155661}{155719}Translate what?
{155721}{155807}He wants me to|translate what he's saying.
{155809}{155854}What is he saying?
{155857}{155914}I think the groom is having doubts...
{155917}{155997}He says 'l suspect the groom|is having doubts.'
{156004}{156057}'l suspect the groom would like to delay.'
{156067}{156107}I think the groom really loves|someone else.
{156111}{156157}That's true, isn't it, Charles?
{156171}{156217}'l suspect the groom...'
{156217}{156287}Because, Charlie -|this is for the rest of your life.
{156324}{156421}Finally, you've got to marry the person|you love with your whole heart.
{156439}{156494}And by the way -|your flies are undone.
{156507}{156557}What's he saying?
{156621}{156679}He says
{156681}{156781}he suspects the groom|loves someone else.
{156831}{156869}Do you?
{156871}{156941}Do you love someone else?|Do you, Charles?
{157221}{157264}I do.
{157407}{157457}Get out of my way! Let me kill him!
{157701}{157751}Blimey!
{157789}{157847}At least it's one we won't forget.
{157847}{157919}A lot of weddings just|blend into each other.
{157921}{158011}- For God's sake!|- This one will stick out in the memory.
{158011}{158081}For not actually including|a wedding service.
{158084}{158149}Poor girl. No, I mean it. Poor girl.
{158151}{158251}She's not my favourite person, but I think|what you did today was unforgivable.
{158254}{158311}I can't bear to think about it.
{158337}{158374}Poor Hen.
{158377}{158461}- Though let's face facts.|- I'm sorry.
{158464}{158557}If you weren't sure you wanted|to marry her today of all days,
{158559}{158637}i.e., your wedding day,
{158637}{158724}then it must be the right decision,|mustn't it?
{158741}{158767}Quite right.
{158769}{158869}It was a lovely dress.|I'm sure she'll find it useful for parties.
{158957}{159049}- What did he say, Charles?|- Says he blames himself.
{159051}{159117}- Absolutely not.|- No, you mustn't, David.
{159141}{159194}They all blame you too.
{159197}{159281}- It's OK.|- No, no. If there's music to be faced,
{159284}{159344}I should be facing it.
{159554}{159601}Hello.
{159604}{159679}- Hi! You're soaking. Come in.|- No, l'm fine.
{159681}{159734}Comes a point when you can't get wetter.
{159737}{159807}- OK, l'll come out.|- No, please don't. I...
{159809}{159874}I just wanted to check you're OK.
{159877}{159959}Not busy killing yourself|or anything, but...
{159997}{160057}But you're fine, so...
{160097}{160189}I shouldn't have come|to the church this morning. I'm sorry.
{160207}{160257}No!
{160271}{160379}Wait. It was all my fault.|I mean, l'm the bastard here.
{160417}{160467}And it sorted out one thing.
{160467}{160571}Marriage and me were very clearly|not meant for one another.
{160574}{160624}It sorted out another big thing, too.
{160627}{160699}There I was,|standing there in the church,
{160701}{160784}and for the first time|in my whole life I realised I
{160787}{160869}totally and utterly loved one person.
{160871}{160931}And it wasn't the person|next to me in the veil.
{160934}{161024}It's the person standing opposite me now
{161074}{161109}in the rain.
{161111}{161177}Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed.
{161179}{161294}The truth of it is, l've loved you|from the first second I met you.
{161317}{161461}- Not going away again, are you?|- No. I might drown. But otherwise, no.
{161464}{161527}OK. OK. We'll go in.
{161599}{161661}But first let me ask you one thing.
{161711}{161799}Do you think, after we've dried off,
{161809}{161919}after we've spent lots more|time together, you might agree
{161961}{162019}not to marry me?
{162021}{162087}And do you think
{162089}{162211}not being married to me might maybe|be something you could consider
{162214}{162277}doing for the rest of your life?
{162391}{162451}Do you?
{162491}{162547}I do.
