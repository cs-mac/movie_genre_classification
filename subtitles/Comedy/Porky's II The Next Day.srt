All they got is talk.

it's the doers who change this world.

And when they do that,
they change us.

The Saints' signature stance,
Copley Plaza Hotel 8 years ago.

199
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,028
2 men of identical height
put Yuri Petrova on his knees...

200
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:27,208
...and each dropped iron
to the back of his head.

Power hath descended
forth from Thy hand.

Eyes front, David.

203
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:39,178
The position of the victim and the
angles produced by the killers' stance...

204
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,180
...created a unique scenario.

205
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,049
The bullets crisscrossed in the skull
and exited the eyes.

206
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,354
Here, this did not occur. The rounds
moved on a straight trajectory...

207
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,724
...through the back of the
victim's head and out the front,

208

But you said he was wicked short.

213
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,252
The Saints were later determined
to be 5'11' tall.

214
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,327
The rounds exit Petrova's eyeballs.

215
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,517
Here, they came out the lower cheek,

216
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,921
3, 4 inches below the eyes.

217
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:35,125
That puts him at 5'7'-ish.
That's not uncommonly short.

218
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,737
The killer posed as a late-night confessor.

219
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,539
Once the victim entered the booth,

220
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,575
the killer had him isolated.
No escape.

221
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,444
Short stuff comes out of the confessional,

222

kicks in the door of the priest's chambers,

223
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,082
leaving a crescent-shaped indentation,

224
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,952
which tells us that this cowboy was
wearing a boot with a pronounced heel.

225
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:55,954
Gave him a couple inches.

He saw the body.

234

00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,762
I know who you are.

was heard throughout heaven.

And the terrible hand of the Lord
struck upon the Earth.

How dare you, sir,
insinuate such a thing?

The fact that you're a greasy spic,

353
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,895
it's got nothing to do with it.

that one, but, look, I can do this.

01:10:22,809 --> 01:10:24,809
(SOFTLY) Yeah, Charlie.

1105
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:37,755
I'll take these.

1106
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,927
Have you been crying again?

1107
01:10:41,027 --> 01:10:43,860
Yeah. Tears of joy.

1108
01:10:44,864 --> 01:10:46,700
Those are queer.
How much?

1109
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,703
Oh, no, no.
You boys are on the house.

1110
01:10:49,803 --> 01:10:51,004
Obliged.

1111
01:10:51,104 --> 01:10:53,104
Well, let's see.

ROMEO: What?
Nothing.

1113
01:11:02,048 --> 01:11:03,316
What, are you saying I look gay?

1114
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:05,819
No, you just hail from a colorful...

1115
01:11:05,919 --> 01:11:10,084
Hey, you don't know me.
Do these make me look gay?

1116
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:15,000
You look like you might have
seen one up close.

1117
01:11:25,672 --> 01:11:31,633
On a sultry Saturday in September,
the Saints saved 17 souls.

01:12:03,643 --> 01:12:06,908
So, how you doing,
Bloomy?

1125
01:12:09,182 --> 01:12:11,343
Just fine, Kunty.

1126

01:13:12,412 --> 01:13:13,847
Nothing.

01:13:15,048 --> 01:13:16,282
Nothing.

I'm just...

1134
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,022
I'm just having a period of adjustment.

1135
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:24,891
You're about to have a period of
getting your ass beat.

This is you.
Fucking be on time.

1138
01:13:38,638 --> 01:13:42,038
You ready for this shit,
my dear brother?

1139
01:13:45,979 --> 01:13:48,869
Let's do some gratuitous violence.

Each one of you...

1143

...is to stick to the guy who
called you like stink on quim.

Pick your own crews.

1145
01:14:14,774 --> 01:14:17,324
You arm yourself to the teeth.

1146
01:14:18,111 --> 01:14:22,215
And when these Bible-banging psychos
make their attempt,

1147
01:14:22,315 --> 01:14:28,265

Okay, here's the situation, Lloyd.

1150
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:44,003
Me and a couple of friends of mine are
fitting to do some killing here tonight.

1151
01:14:44,103 --> 01:14:46,773
I'm talking bullets, blood,
custom wholesale slaughter.

You follow me, Lloyd-o?

(WHIMPERS)

Good. Now, I've run into a little snag.

1155
01:14:52,545 --> 01:14:56,182
You see, I'm trying to figure out a tag line.

1156
01:14:56,282 --> 01:14:57,850
You know, something cool to say
when it's all over,

1157
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:01,351
like, 'We're gonna need a bigger boat.'

1158
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:05,725
Or, 'I'll be back.' But mine, you know?
I've gotta own this thing.

1159
01:15:05,825 --> 01:15:08,928
It's creative.
It happened to be a creative plan.

1160
01:15:09,028 --> 01:15:10,029
Fucking ridiculous.

1161
01:15:10,129 --> 01:15:12,699
Probably based on some
stupid shit you saw in a movie.

1162

And here I am again, all tying
myself up with fucking rope.

1163

What's the deal with you and
the fucking rope? Honestly.

1164
01:15:18,237 --> 01:15:21,140
It happened to be a very
useful thing, so shut it.

1165
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,810
You didn't get this from a movie, did you?

1166
01:15:26,312 --> 01:15:28,047
The Eiger Sanction with Clint Eastwood.
Fuck.

1167
01:15:28,147 --> 01:15:29,782
And it worked like a charm for him.

1168

I fucking knew.

1169

Well, then, just...

No. I don't care what you're doing here...

...with your fucking friends.
It's none of my business.

surname or a nickname or something?

He called him the Roman.

The Roman?

Agent Kuntsler, you gotta see this.
We just found...

1431
01:34:03,295 --> 01:34:08,395
It's Bloom. She just back-doored
this info from Fed archives.

He's in York, Maine. About an hour
from here. But he's off the grid.

Better get a move on or
they'll get there before you do.

Yeah.

Will you be all right, dear?

1446

I hear Costa Rica's nice.

I never thought I'd ask this of another

She's beautiful, no?

But I forget, your eyes are blind to beauty.

You are...

1459

You are a destroyer, Noah.

You know my reasons.

But do you?

1462
01:38:20,301 --> 01:38:24,585
You think it's...
You think it's for your father.

1463
01:38:26,424 --> 01:38:31,589
No. You were born a killer.

Death, la morte,

No.

01:39:09,534 --> 01:39:12,992
You were not there to raise them.

Not one single day.

1472
01:39:17,675 --> 01:39:22,635
But how closely they followed
their father's footsteps.

1473
01:39:23,615 --> 01:39:28,746
They got your blood,
Noah, tua rabbia.

It gives me the creeps.

1487

They?

1493
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:08,584
They were creating something.
An empire.

They?

1495
01:41:10,188 --> 01:41:12,188
I was helping them.

1496
01:41:13,057 --> 01:41:15,057
I used you, Noah,

1497
01:41:15,627 --> 01:41:20,860
to destroy their competition,
to cut out their cancers.

1498
01:41:23,835 --> 01:41:26,463
I earned my place among them.

1499
01:41:30,608 --> 01:41:35,045
Is this your place amongst them?
Because all I see...

1500
01:41:36,414 --> 01:41:39,814
...is an old man in a broke-down palace,

1501

sitting in a garden.

1502

The scorpion and the frog...

1503

...both lose everything.

1504

See, without you,
I was no longer useful to them.

1505
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,840
They cast me out.

1506
01:42:08,346 --> 01:42:10,915
My old man used to tell me
about a place like this.

1507
01:42:11,015 --> 01:42:14,252
Back in the woods,
he said that there's this guy...

01:50:32,383 --> 01:50:34,681
You are exposed,
young lady.

1572
01:50:36,487 --> 01:50:41,792
You're a very clever little girl, Eunice.
That's why I chose you.

1573
01:50:41,892 --> 01:50:46,420
Now it's time for you
to put your thinking cap on.

1574
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:51,736
We got all the financial backing
and protection...

1575
01:50:51,836 --> 01:50:54,305
...of the biggest corporation in the world.

1576
01:50:54,405 --> 01:50:58,364
And 2 CEOs worthy of the public trust.

1577
01:51:00,344 --> 01:51:03,780
Now, what do you think is going on here?

1578
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:07,952
You wanna get them out.

1579
01:51:08,052 --> 01:51:09,887
I want to get them out,
get them back to work,

1580
01:51:09,987 --> 01:51:12,757
take this thing to a whole new level.

1581
01:51:12,857 --> 01:51:14,982
Where're they being held?

1582
01:51:18,495 --> 01:51:23,626
CROWD: Set them free. Set them free.

1583
01:51:34,879 --> 01:51:38,576
CROWD: Set them free.

1584
01:51:45,556 --> 01:51:48,191
The Hoag ain't just any prison.

1585
01:51:48,258 --> 01:51:52,096
Wrong. That's exactly
what it is, just a prison.

1586
01:51:52,196 --> 01:51:57,065
Run by men.
Men, as we both know, are fallible.

1587
01:52:00,638 --> 01:52:03,808
EUNICE: Well, whatever we do,
we gotta do it quick.

1588
01:52:03,908 --> 01:52:06,628
Those boys aren't safe in there.

1589
01:52:07,044 --> 01:52:08,546
SMECKER: Oh, I don't know.

1590
01:52:08,646 --> 01:52:13,879
A little birdie tells me
they're gonna be just fine.

1591
01:52:14,051 --> 01:52:16,020
(THE SAINTS ARE COMING
PLAYING)...

1592
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,953
...* The saints are coming...

1593
01:52:19,056 --> 01:52:22,219
...* The saints are coming...

1594
01:52:22,526 --> 01:52:25,462
...* I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply...

1595
01:52:25,562 --> 01:52:28,360
...* The saints are coming...

1596
01:52:28,465 --> 01:52:31,730

01:52:32,002 --> 01:52:37,102
...* I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply...

1598
01:53:03,133 --> 01:53:05,870
...* A drowning sorrow floods
the deepest grief...

1599
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:08,097
...* How long now?

1600
01:53:08,605 --> 01:53:12,109
* Until a weather change condemns belief...

1601
01:53:12,209 --> 01:53:14,209
...* The stone says...

1602
01:53:14,878 --> 01:53:18,349
...* This paternal guide once had his day...

1603
01:53:18,449 --> 01:53:20,489
...* Once had his day...

1604
01:53:24,888 --> 01:53:27,721
...* The saints are coming...

1605
01:53:27,825 --> 01:53:30,953
...* The saints are coming...

1606
01:53:31,362 --> 01:53:34,231
...* I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply...

1607
01:53:34,331 --> 01:53:37,300
...* The saints are coming...

1608
01:53:37,401 --> 01:53:40,336
...* The saints are coming...

1609
01:53:40,637 --> 01:53:43,807
...* I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply...

1610
01:53:43,907 --> 01:53:46,877
...* I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply...

1611
01:53:46,977 --> 01:53:53,906
...* I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply...

1612
01:53:55,719 --> 01:53:57,844
...(HOLY FOOL PLAYING)...

1613
01:54:05,796 --> 01:54:09,791
...* I know there's
something happening here...

1614
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:14,295
...* I know there's
something happening here...

1615
01:54:15,706 --> 01:54:20,439
...* Do my eyes deceive my ears?

1616
01:54:24,314 --> 01:54:26,976
* Can you feel that, man?

1617
01:54:29,186 --> 01:54:31,746
* Can you feel that, man?

1618
01:54:34,258 --> 01:54:36,258
* I sure as hell can...

1619
01:54:36,994 --> 01:54:39,374
...* Can you feel that, man?

1620
01:54:58,715 --> 01:55:02,742
* 2,000 years I've reigned...

1621
01:55:04,388 --> 01:55:06,948
...* As the King of Man...

1622
01:55:08,425 --> 01:55:15,058
...* And every morning
you felt my guiding hand, yeah...

1623
01:55:17,568 --> 01:55:20,765
...* What'd you do to deserve me?

1624
01:55:21,972 --> 01:55:26,375
* I spread my wings and my minions sing...

1625
01:55:26,677 --> 01:55:29,397
...* I know you heard it, man...

1626
01:55:30,514 --> 01:55:34,254
...* Yet my sun still shines on your back...

1627
01:55:34,353 --> 01:55:37,158
...* Your mountains, your sins...

1628
01:55:40,824 --> 01:55:44,590
...* You gotta come to me...

1629
01:55:45,496 --> 01:55:49,364
...* You gotta come to me...

1630
01:55:50,267 --> 01:55:53,752
...* With your arms outstretched, baby...

1631
01:55:53,845 --> 01:55:55,172
...* You better come to me...

1632
01:55:55,272 --> 01:55:57,397
...* And on your knees...

1633
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:03,671
...* 'Cause I'm your holy...

1634
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:06,010
...* Your holy fool...

1635
01:56:06,650 --> 01:56:09,050
...* I am your holy fool...

1636
01:56:09,153 --> 01:56:13,180
...* Yes, I'm your holy...

1637

...* Your holy fool...

1638
01:56:16,126 --> 01:56:18,686
...* I am your holy fool...

1639
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:31,070
...* Power has descended
forth from my hand...

1640
01:56:31,675 --> 01:56:34,439
...* I know you felt it, man...

1641
01:56:35,345 --> 01:56:39,085
...* Yet my sun still shines on your back...

1642
01:56:39,383 --> 01:56:42,188
...* Your mountains, your sins...

1643
01:56:42,986 --> 01:56:44,986
...* Yeah...

1644
01:56:45,037 --> 01:56:48,219
...* Yes, I know that you fear me...

1645
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:53,318
...* I call upon you from my holy hill...

1646
01:56:54,097 --> 01:56:56,900
...* Sometimes I ask you to live...

1647
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,125

1653
01:57:21,325 --> 01:57:22,659
...* You better come to me...

1654
01:57:22,759 --> 01:57:24,759
...* And on your knees

1655
01:57:26,897 --> 01:57:29,022
* 'Cause I'm your holy...
