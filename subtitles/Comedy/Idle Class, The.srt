00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,990
Cheers!

8
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,160
Ah, it's good.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,450
Wow. It's different for elite groups, different.

10
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:51,020
Hyung. That is expensive intelligence that I obtained by using up all the advance payment from my part time job.

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,350
Then, we four will be studying together like this, right?

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,430
Then does that mean we can get into JH?

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,180
Of course! To those who rely on their family background,

14
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,780
we will show them!

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,030
- That's right.
- Of course!

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,720
You are pretty cool today. The best!

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,610
This girl is clueless. I'm normally the best.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,950
Tell them to shake up the ladder!

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,460
Tell them to kick it off from below!

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,970
I'm going to keep climbing up until I achieve it.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,040
Wow! The best!!!

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,710
- We are going to crush them!
- Crush them!

23
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,150
Eat. Eat more. You can't get tired of meat.

24
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,280
These aren't my size.

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,730
What is wrong with her?

26
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,020
Ah! It's hot!

27
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,010
They're too small.

28
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,690
Where's mine? Not my size.

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,770
What's wrong with her?

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,270
Hey!

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,710
Those are your size.

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,960
I feel like flying.

33
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,000
Daebak!!

34
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,010
I ate well today.

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,360
We should have done this sooner.

36
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,790
Now are all of my debts repaid?

37
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,710
What do you mean debts? It feels like I received a surprise gift.

38
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,040
Chef, do you perhaps like movies?

39
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,700
I have two tickets to a movie premier.

40
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,610
Um, movies are a little...

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,630
He's so good at cooking clams.

42
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,380
We really enjoyed the meal!

43
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,750
Get a hold of yourself!

44
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,700
Next time, let's eat casserole. Buy me some casserole.

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,620
It's Si Kyeong!

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,330
Si Kyeong!

47
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,050
Si Kyeong.

48
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,710
Kim Ha Ni?

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,220
Now you remember my name.

50
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,950
Then, see if you remember this, too.

51

Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Under The Sea Team @ Viki

52
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,960
Hey! Stop it. What kind of disgraceful behavior is this?!

53
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,730
You, wicked vixen!

54
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,210
We're all going to get into JH.

55
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,530
As soon as I become huma...

56
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,720
Yoon Jin Ah, Long time no see.

57
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,980
You're much more handsome in person, Chef Gwon.

58
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,550
Are they your friends, Yoon Jin Ah?

59
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,310
Yes, we used to know each other briefly.

60
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,360
Hey, briefly?

61
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,110
Si Kyeong, do you remember me now? At the Han River we...

62
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,240
Then see you next time! Let's go. Let's go.

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,290
- Bye.
- Take care.

64
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,780
Does he remember?

65
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,650
Si Kyeong...

66
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,230
Episode 5
Would an embellished self introduction be fruitless?

67
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,320
To me, love is a time bomb that will explode in 100 days.

68
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,570
To die or to love. It's one or the other.

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,270
Watch and see. You will definitely...

70
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,980
Yes?

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,830
Chef, I've made a reservation at a restaurant where you will be tasting samples.

72
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,450
Yeah. Let's get going.

73
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,500
Wake up! Wake up!

74
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,290
Wake up! Wake up!

75
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,450
[ Blood Alcohol Level: 1.312% ]

76
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,490
Ah, so dizzy! I feel so dizzy that I can't get up.

77
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,510
Then continue and sleep. Alright?

78
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,080
I was going to help you clean up the situation on how you attacked Gwon Si Kyeong yesterday.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,030
What?

80
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,100
You don't remember?

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,010
Let's see if you remember this, Si Kyeong.

82
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,390
That wasn't a dream?!

83
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,110
I've seen numerous nut jobs but I've never seen such a crazy girl like you before, you madwoman!

84
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,050
I must be crazy!

85
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,720
Then, what was Si Kyeong's reaction?

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,100
He seemed flustered but also looked like he was trying to remember something.

87
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,660
Really?! Then do you think he remembers me a little?

88
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,110
Are you happy? Are you happy that you got found out as a mermaid?

89
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,330
You really are a gold fish!

90
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,990
You are indeed Julie's reincarnation.

91
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,350
Why? If he knew that I saved his life, he would love me.

92
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,080
Julie, this is not a fairytale land.

93
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,590
There is no such man who would fall in love with a mermaid...a crazy mermaid at that!

94
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,060
Never! Ever! There is none!

95
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,630
We need to put this situation under control quickly.

96
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,030
How do we do that?

97
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,220
You just have to feign ignorance.

98
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,460
I was just drunk. I am normally very careful in my conduct. I am sorry.

99
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,520
That's what you should insist upon.

100
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,650
Let's go.

101
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,540
Where?

102
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,590
Here.

103
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,920
What is this?

104
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,960
[ Gwon Si Kyeong is at a restaurant in Itaewon. ]

105
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,540
The chef here is famous for posting "Today's menu" on Facebook.

106
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,820
The concept is good.

107
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,010
Oh my, Jin Ah. We meet again. What a coincidence.

108
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,770
Oh, Si Kyeong. What an incredible coincidence.

109
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,420
Oh, but there are no seats.

110
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,020
We can sit with you guys, right?

111
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,670
Is that alright?

112
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,630
We are on a business so it will be difficu...

113
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,200
Please do so. We ordered a lot anyway.

114
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,240
Let's eat it together.

115
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,440
That's right, Jin Ah. Can we talk a little?

116
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,860
Why?

117
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,490
Hyeon Myeong gave me an important message to deliver to you.

118
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,040
Should I say it right here?

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,970
Chef, let me leave for a moment.

120
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,810
Ok.

121
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,900
Me, too.

122
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,950
Si Kyeong.

123
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,640
Hurry up and tell me. What is it?

124
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,940
You live in the same building as that chef.

125
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,600
You went there knowing, right?

126
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,140
You moved in because you had already made up your mind break up, right?

127
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,540
It must be right. I was just poking around.

128
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,480
But I won't blame you as a materialistic person.

129
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,430
Since you waited for an unemployed person for 3 years, you've done a lot.

130
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,790
I have no thought of explaining to you. Move.

131
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,340
You and Hyeon Myeong didn't suit each other since the beginning.

132
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,770
Don't you remember? I read tarot cards for you two.

133
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,490
I said that you two won't stay together.

134
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,240
That you'd betray him in the end.

135
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,240
Are you not curious? You and that chef's future?

136
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,400
What friendship you have. You are going to earn some time for her like this?

137
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,700
It's unfair.

138
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,970
You're stuck to him all day but she can't see Gwon Si Kyeong at all.

139
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,780
What are you going to do?
You don't want me to?

140
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,890
Please get me one more.

141
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,150
You must really like water?

142
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,800
Ah, yes.

143
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,640
You were very surprised yesterday, right?

144
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,370
I was surprised every time I saw you, but yesterday
was a bit strong.

145
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,930
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,300
I usually am the modest type but because of that damn alcohol...

147
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,630
But what is it that I have to recognize?

148
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,840
You said that every time we met.

149
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,050
Ah, that is...

150
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,310
I am your fan, Chef!

151
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,310
I've been following you around for years but you never noticed me.

152
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,180
Lies.

153
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,270
I remember everything now.

154
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,530
You saved me...when I fell in the water.

155
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,410
Also...

156
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,950
The secret you wanted to keep...

157
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,230
wasn't it this?

158
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,370
The food that you ordered is here.

159
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,640
You must have been very tired.

160
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm sorry. I guess I'm still not awake from the alcohol.

161
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,410
I'm never going to drink that damned alcohol again.

162
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,810
Whoa, awesome! It looks so delicious!

163
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,350
Eat it and please critique it.

164
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,240
Since tasting many menus and listening to
evaluations is my work.

165
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,150
Wow, it's really savory.

166
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,310
If we fry seaweed like this, it'll probably be delicious.

167
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,600
Fried Seaweed... that's freshly original.

168
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,460
Since it's roasted it's so very savory, it tastes sweet too.

169
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,760
You know the taste of food.

170
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,810
Do you want me to show you something fun?

171
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,820
The food you make probably tastes way better than this, right?

172
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,660
I'm so curious!

173
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,740
Later when I become a human, please make it for me.

174
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,590
When you become a human?

175
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,510
When she finds employment, when she finds employment. That's what she means.

176
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,520
If you don't have a job these days you can't be treated as a human being, right?

177
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,540
Of course, of course.

178
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,300
I'm sorry, Chef, the conversation became long.

179
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,140
Kim Ha Ni's taste buds are on point.

180
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,250
And her food evaluations are fresh.

181
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,470
Oh, really?

182
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,120
As foodies, we don't lose out to anyone.

183
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,690
It looks so delicious! May I try some?

184
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,960
I will eat well.

185
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
It's super delicious.

186
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,940
Oh, Daebak (awesome)! This is completely delicious.

187
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,580
We ate well.

188
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,810
I had a fun meal because of you also.

189
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,040
Your food evaluation was very good also.

190
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,510
If you have time tomorrow by any chance, do you want to eat together?

191
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,710
Oh my God. These words that have just now hit my cochlea.

192
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,790
..this is a date isn't it?
Amazing!

193
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,830
Of course! I totally have time.

194
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,520
Then I will decide on the place and call you.

195
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,370
I have to get going due to the rehearsal.

196
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,930
- Jin Ah.
- Yes.

197
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,830
Jin Ah, finish the tasting and then come in.

198
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,380
Yes I understand. Take care.

199
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,230
Which way are you going, Ha Ni?

200
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,610
Me?
To Northwest!

201
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,470
We're going home.

202
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,930
Where are you going?

203
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,070
I have to go to the company.

204
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,230
Excuse me, customer.

205
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,640
- Yes?
- You dropped this.

206
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,440
This belongs to the Chef.

207
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,280
Thank you.

208
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,740
I love you.

209
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,590
Try coming in if you can.

210
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:12,010
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Under The Sea Team @ Viki

211
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,200
Yes, what are you doing?

212
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,690
Big!

213
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,940
Big!

214
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,830
Get up, quickly!

215
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,980
Seriously, what are you doing?

216
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,850
Hurry up.
-Are you crazy?

217
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,220
We have to study. Hurry.

218
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,350
Hey, I was breaking my record. I was breaking my record!

219
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,670
Hey, let go.

220
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,860
You're still the same.

221
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,690
Hyung!

222
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,470
Seon Jae.

223
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,690
How have you been?

224
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,910
Oh, yes. After opening the law office

225
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,920
I was going to come to see you first but I was too busy.

226
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,090
You don't know him right?

227
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,420
He's the same age as Ji Yong Hyung,

228
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,720
and he's a Hyung that used to live with us that passed the bar exam and got out.

229
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,580
At the top.

230
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,880
Woah!

231
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,550
You're a great Hyung-nim.

232
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,780
Honestly,

233
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,490
I came because I had a proposition for you.

234
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,570
What?

235
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,860
Do you by any chance have any thoughts of being an office manager?

236
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,540
A friend of mine recently opened his practice.

237
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,780
An office manager?

238
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,110
At your age passing the bar will be difficult for you and even finding employment is hard too.

239
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,210
You can't find a job as an office manager these days.

240
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,520
I got a job.

241
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,990
Truthfully, the public prosecutors or judges don't make much.

242
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,740
I well... I went into a large corporation.

243
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,920
But... a large corporation, where?

244
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,760
JH.

245
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,610
Oh, that's great!

246
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,030
Then you should come out to the alumni meeting. The kids are all worried about you.

247
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,250
What worry.

248
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,210
B**** Ahn Hye Yeong

249
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,560
Aiyoo, these guys...

250
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,230
They're calling me all day when I took a personal day and I'm resting at home.

251
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,230
Oh, Assistant Manager Ahn.

252
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,920
Have you eaten something for the hangover? Should I bring you something?

253
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,680
Oh, yes. The buyer said okay.

254
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,730
That's right. I told you that if you did it the way I directed you to the deal would go through.

255
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,720
What is this bull? I'm asking if you ate?

256
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,880
Yes, yes. I'll buy you a meal.

257
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,340
You worked hard, Assistant Manager Ahn. Okay.

258
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,220
My coworkers rely on me so much.

259
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,830
Aigoo, then you should come out to the alumni meeting this week.

260
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,040
We're getting together this Friday.

261
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,710
This Friday?

262
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,910
I'm going on a business trip to New York on Friday.

263
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,310
New York?

264
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,750
Wow, that's so great. You even get to go to New York.

265
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,250
I'm tired of airplane meals by now.

266
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,970
- I'll be leaving.
- Okay, be careful driving.

267
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,140
It's not a lie. I'm predicting it.

268
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm going to get hired.

269
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,020
Hyeon Myeong,

270
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,690
Let's study!

271
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,090
That's great! That dream,

272
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,160
I'm going to make it come to pass.

273
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,130
What about Ha Ni?

274
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,760
Ha Ni, she wasn't there.

275
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,190
For now, let's leave her out.

276
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,230
Why are you leaving me out?!

277
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,930
I'm going to go to JH too.

278
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,590
Assistant Manager Ahn? I'm going to...

279
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,120
Let's hurry up and study.

280
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,260
Me too, me too, me too.

281
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,170
Okay, the ways we can win against spec (qualification) and backing (connection) is

282
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,790
only by our written introductions.

283
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,940
You know, right, that my specialty is embellishing the written self introduction.

284
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,280
The ideal candidates whom JH looks for is people with passion, challenging spirit, and creativity.

285
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,350
Do you have any experiences to match these?

286
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,410
You don't have any?

287
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,380
For me, passion.

288
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,700
I've collected all Air Jordan sneakers without skipping a single version!

289
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,730
For me, challenge!

290
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,830
With unscathed will, I'm putting up a challenge with everything I got!

291
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,180
W-where?

292
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,050
Follow, Follow me. Momma's Club Party.

293
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,570
What about you, Hyung?

294
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,720
S Law School. If for that one thing, it's over.

295
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,490
Everything else is left out for the beauty of nothingness.

296
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,960
Why are even you being like this?

297
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,030
For the embellished self introductions,

298
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,430
graduating from a prestigious university doesn't hold much merit.

299
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,140
What's wrong with the most prestigious law school in the country?

300
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,500
Do you know how high (college entrance exam) scores you need to get in order to be admitted to my school?

301
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,890
Well, for art major kids, it probably won't be easy to grasp that high a number.

302
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,220
I studied a bit too.

303
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,480
Whatever!

304
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Explain to me why my prestigious academic background doesn't hold much merit in this case, please.

305
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,260
Let me put it this way.

306
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,200
They would see many, many highly qualified candidates with degrees from overseas

307
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,360
who are also armored with having international volunteer experiences.

308
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,280
On top of that, you are old.

309
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,600
You look older than you are as well.

310
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,970
Nah... He doesn't look older.

311
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,180
If you look closely, he's cute.

312
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,990
Even if you say nice things like that, it's too late.

313
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,920
It's not time to be joking right now.

314
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,510
If you're planning on getting into the Employment War,

315
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,580
you really need to reflect on yourself first.

316
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,310
But, Hyung, Big, and Ha Ni.

317
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,650
I'm telling you this objectively. You guys all don't have any merit.

318
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,480
Then what is your merit?

319
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,880
How come a mighty man like you hasn't gotten a job yet?

320
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,870
Jin Ah who was with you got a job in just one try!

321
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,060
Why are you talking about Jin Ah in this situation?!

322
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,270
You got on my nerves first!

323
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,020
If you know that much (about the self introduction), you could write it for us.

324
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,620
Does that make sense?!

325
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,900
How can someone else write "self" introduction for you?

326
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,020
Then what are you telling me to do?! Never mind.

327
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,170
You can easily find better self-introduction experts on the Internet anyway!

328
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,510
Hyung, why are you being like this?

329
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,290
Ghostwriters for self introduction

330
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,770
Search for them.

331
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,740
How could he look down on us like that?

332
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,200
He went to the elite study group meeting once

333
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,870
and he's become so arrogant!

334
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,450
If he's so good at writing it, shouldn't he have already employed a long time ago?

335
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,860
Isn't that right?

336
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,590
I found it!

337
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,700
Let me see. Where?

338
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,360
Look at this! Look at this!

339
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,980
They've got glowing reviews!

340
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,340
Ghostwriters who write self introductions for job candidates?First round acceptable documents aren't difficult!

341
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,440
They are the people who get paid for writing self introductions for others.

342
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,490
Look at this! They've got positive reviews!brDon't worry about the self-introduction. Daepil will do it!

343
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,880
- Let me try sending a message.
- Okay.

344
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,620
If we ask you to write the self introduction, how much do you charge?
Daepil = ghostwriter

345
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,780
What?

346
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,640
200,000 Won (approx. $200)?!

347
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,120
This isn't too bad.

348
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,150
Even if someone's to pay me twice as much, I won't be able to write it well.

349
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,250
I don't have money.

350
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,550
Do you have some?

351
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,720
No, but Big should. Don't you?

352
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,200
I used up all my allowance money.

353
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,670
I bought the Air Jordan 6 Carmines.

354
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,170
G-Dragon doesn't even have those shoes yet.

355
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,230
Beg your mom saying that you need to buy books.

356
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,430
No, you would have already bought about 100 books by now. How about a laptop?

357
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,530
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

358
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,860
Mom,

359
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,710
I need to study but

360
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,670
my laptop broke and I can't study.

361
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,080
400,000 Won.

362
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,010
Okay, I understand!

363
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,240
That's it! That's it!

364
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,550
Thank you, thank you! Where should I order it?

365
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,890
Uncle! I need 200,000 Won to study.

366
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,950
Are you crazy?

367
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,370
Hey, did you forget about my pearl necklaces and the Goryeo celadon vase I gave you?

368
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,540
Should I pour water on my legs and turn into a mermaid?

369
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,120
Got it. Thanks! I'm good as well!

370
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,090
Okay, okay!

371
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,460
Si Kyeong, Si Kyeong, I will never give up on you.

372
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,740
Even if you don't recognize me,

373
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,590
I will never give up.

374
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,360
Love to me is a time bomb that'll explode in 100 days.

375
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,430
To die or to love.

376
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,330
One of the two.

377
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,590
Yoon Jin Ah moved into the 8th floor.

378
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,780
She changed her perfume. The brand is unknown.

379
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,740
Why don't you let others around you know about this?

380
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,660
Stress is the worst thing for the prosopagnosia (face blindness).

381
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,910
Prosopagnosia?

382
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,350
Why isn't he calling me?

383
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,450
He hasn't contacted you yet?

384
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,240
He called, he called, he called!

385
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,430
Si Kyeong.

386
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,360
Yes.

387
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,990
Tomorrow, in front of the company?

388
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,390
Yes, I will see you tomorrow.

389
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,850
Are you happy?

390
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,860
It's all your work. Thank you very much!

391
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,680
What do you think of this color? Isn't it pretty?

392
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,260
It's so pretty.

393
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,420
Drain the tub and dry your tail first.

394
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,110
Since you're going on a date, I'll let you have the Sexy Red.

395
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,280
I... should shave my legs as well.

396
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,020
You never know. We might make a great progress!

397
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,000
You sly fish!

398
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,110
Drain the tub quickly!

399
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,560
Team Leader Kim, where are you right now?

400
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,020
I'm conducting a taste sampling for the upcoming project.

401
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,740
I almost fainted at the Sodam restaurant tonight.

402
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,210
Galbijjim doesn't have any flavor! In short, it tasted like s***!

403
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,100
What is the problem? Who is the problem?

404
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,440
Where is the problem?

405
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,660
I'll go over there right away and report it back to you.

406
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,570
No one has professionalism!

407
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,350
Driver Kim. Didn't I ask you to stock snacks in the car?

408
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,680
I'm sorry.

409
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,200
Everyone's an armature.

410
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,340
Stop the car.

411
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,880
One serving, please.

412
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,930
I'm closed for the night.

413
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,880
Why? You still got a lot of them left.

414
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,060
Since I changed the flour vendor, it just doesn't taste as it should.

415
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,230
Then are you saying that you're going throw all this away?

416
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,420
I'm going to eat it.

417
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,240
I can't give this to customers.

418
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,660
Ah...

419
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,860
You're quite proud of your products.

420
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,650
I will buy them.

421
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,910
I know since I'm in the same industry.

422
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,890
If you throw away all these, your loss is way too great.

423
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,910
You can't consider this a loss if you think about the customers who eat these and won't ever be back.

424
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,360
You're right...

425
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,810
Right then. I'll come back next time to try these.

426
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,080
Yes, please come by.

427
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,330
Team Leader Kim.

428
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,180
Discard all the food from Sodam tonight.

429
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,330
So we could serve great food next time.

430
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:15,080
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Under The Sea Team @ Viki

431
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,350
Hey, Writer Lee.

432
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,960
How's your "novel" (self introduction) going?

433
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,780
Isn't it about a time that you write a bestseller?

434
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,370
I haven't heard anything about it recently.

435
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,230
What's with this relaxed attitude? Have you given up JH?

436
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,560
What are you going to when Sun Jae finds out about your lie?

437
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,280
"When you are sick, go see a doctor; when you need medication, go see a pharmacist" (Seek expert advices.)

438
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,850
When you need a novel, you seek a novel writer.

439
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,540
What are you saying?

440
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,330
I left the work to the professional self introduction writer for 200,000 Won.

441
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,780
It is so obvious.

442
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,790
These days, employers

443
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,770
filter out all ghostwritten introductions.

444
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,620
If you are jealous just say so.

445
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,480
Those are retired professional broadcasting writers we are talking about.

446
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,050
While we're enjoying our meal,

447
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,860
they are writing a magnificent novel reflecting our lives.

448
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,770
Is that so?

449
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,960
Even if that's the case,

450
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,910
you'll totally get crushed during the interview.

451
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,540
Totally!

452
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,940
While working part-time during the day, I prepared myself for employment at night

453
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,680
As I became the de facto breadwinner of the household...

454
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,360
This is way too cliche.

455
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,020
Folder Name: Self Introduction

456
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,530
Finally! It's about the time that our self introductions are coming in. Open it!

457
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,030
- It came!
- It came!
- Hurry and click on it.

458
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,180
I'm so excited!

459
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,290
Hurry up and open it.

460
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,620
Self Introduction
You write it yourself!

461
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,950
You write it yourself?

462
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,580
What is this?

463
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,910
I'll call them.

464
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,350
These jerks.

465
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,490
- There's another attachment!
- Right? Of course.

466
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,630
- Open the file, hurry!
- This is it!

467
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,760
I got scared!

468
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,850
That's what I'm talking about.

469
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,010
I have to download it.

470
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,890
It's a video.

471
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,080
Do they make self introduction in videos?

472
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,720
Whoa. Expensive service sure is different.

473
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,610
What age are we living in, right?

474
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,550
It's coming out, coming out!

475
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,460
This it it!

476
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,560
She is a foreigner.

477
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,500
- Aren't they answering the phone?!
- They are not answering.

478
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,420
Aish!

479
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,090
Hey! Jot down their company address.

480
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,850
- Sah ahhh.
- Forget it.

481
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,320
I'm envious.
You get to eat tasty food and earn money.

482
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,370
Should I just broadcast eating, too?

483
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,220
Hey, "just broadcast eating"??

484
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,720
Can you eat 10 ramyun, 5 portions of spicy fried octopus and 2 whole chicken all in one sitting?

485
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,900
How dare you trying to take over my specialty?

486
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,250
It's because I'm frustrated.

487
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,430
If it were me, instead of writing novels, I would do something about it.

488
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,300
Can you at least do something like free lancing or something like that?

489
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,550
Try it, I'll help you.

490
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,050
Oppa, help me too.

491
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,760
These jerks!

492
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,960
Even their company address is incorrect.

493
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,580
Then even the reviews were all written by them?

494
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,980
We just wasted on the transportation fee.

495
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,300
The money?

496
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,810
We were totally destroyed.

497
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,140
My 400,000 won! (~$400)

498
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,660
Aish. Like they had no one else to take advantage of that they take advantage of surplus people like us?

499
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,590
I just lost out on Air Jordan limited edition.

500
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,450
Hyung, consider it as the price for escaping from a greater disaster.

501
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,120
Let's get together again and do something.

502
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,330
What?

503
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,220
Someone got hired by Apple while walking around the world on foot.

504
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,950
Another got hired by Samsung after being in a quiz show.

505
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,840
How about if we stop writing novels and really do something?

506
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,730
So then what do you want to do?

507
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,370
Do something like one day sales,

508
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,000
and do something that's meaningful.

509
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,950
Like charity work.

510
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,780
Sounds good.

511
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,230
But what should we sell?

512
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,200
Takoyaki? (Octopus ball)

513
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,540
Takoyaki?

514
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,120
I don't want to.

515
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,210
Just lend it to me for one day.

516
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,490
You, if you don't, then I'll turn my legs and turn myself into mer...

517
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,590
Yes, fine. You can turn back to mermaid or do whatever you want. Do you want me to splash the water on you?

518
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,670
Ack!

519
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,870
Are you really going to be like this?! I already told the kids yes!

520
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,170
Princess. There is a saying that you don't lend your car or your woman.

521
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,610
This is my treasure number 1!

522
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:46,110
Please save the poor kids who are struggling to get a job. Please?

523
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,950
Please save me who is struggling to earn my child's school tuition. Please?

524
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,710
You don't sell during the day time anyway!

525
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:59,090
I need to get a job soon so I can earn money and pay back your money.

526
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,230
Please.

527
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,650
Just during the day time. Alright?

528
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,150
Witch Ahn, you are the best! The best!

529
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,130
Thank you, Witch Ahn!

530
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,970
Yay!!! Woohoo!

531
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,040
Yay! Woohoo!

532
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:26,020
So, now how can we make an issue?

533
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,410
In Tongyoung, Cursing Latte is a big topic.

534
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,610
- Cursing Latte?
- Yeah. Search for it.

535
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,080
Latte is spelled with double "t".

536
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,160
- tte?
- Yes.

537
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,990
You were going to write a single "t", weren't you?

538
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,220
Oh boy!

539
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,190
This is awesome! It's so funny!

540
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,070
If you were the customer, this is how they would have written:

541
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,490
"His face is a chic city man; When he speaks, he is a country bumpkin."

542
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,180
And Hyeon Myeong is...

543
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,060
"The one who sacrificed and became a sacrifice."

544
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,540
Seon Joo Hyung is...

545
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,900
"Fearless foolish neighbor hyung"

546
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,570
Ha Ni is, "A fish who has a terrible taste in men."

547
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,410
What about me?

548
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,370
"You bit***"

549
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,310
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

550
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,170
We don't have time for marketing like that.

551
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:27,590
Isn't there any winning strategy with just one day?

552
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,460
Broadcasting eating! Hye Young noona's Takoyaki eating broadcasting.

553
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,520
What about this concept?

554
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,370
Food broadcasting of the avenger who is saving surpluses who are in danger.

555
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,130
It's not like all of us will be dressing up, is it?

556
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,390
I graduated from S university. (Top university in Korea)

557
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,290
Sounds fun, I really wanted to try this sort of thing.

558
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,760
And if we can do some kind of charity work or some other meaningful things...

559
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,740
It would be great if we can do that.

560
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,220
What about this?

561
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,010
While Ha Ni's uncle was making Takoyaki, he gets a heat stroke.

562
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,150
No, not heat stroke, a liver disease!

563
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,860
I am coughing! Cough! Cough!

564
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,740
Geesh, that's gross.

565
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,490
Then, what about about a nose bleed?

566
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,580
A nose bleed.

567
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,110
He falls on the floor dramatically.

568
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,910
I feel like falling. Aigoo!

569
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,080
Just then, we see him.

570
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,640
Oh, my world! Oh, no! Oh, boy!

571
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,670
Ahjussi! Ahjussi! Ahjussi! No!

572
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,030
Tears, tears, tears.

573
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,030
Instead of just being sad, let's revive this Tako truck!

574
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,540
That's how we started selling takoyaki.

575
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,070
Mix, mix!

576
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,680
Takoyaki...

577
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,110
At that time, a poor ajumma shows up!

578
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,460
I'm hungry.

579
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,400
Just take it.

580
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,810
No, I'll but it all.

581
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,360
CEO Hong.
-CEO Hong.

582
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,050
CEO Hong.

583
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,070
Oh my!

584
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,540
CEO Hong!

585
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,170
Hey, it's pretty.

586
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,700
Do it properly, properly.

587
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,410
Hey, crazy.

588
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,640
Where are you going?

589
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,280
I saw it all.

590
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,250
Hey!
Hey you!

591
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,150
Where did it go?

592
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,630
Yes, what is the matter?

593
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,650
Chef...

594
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,890
I...

595
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,420
Chef, we have a problem.

596
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,220
The cooking class needs to start in 10 minutes.

597
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,090
Okay.

598
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:12,000
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Under The Sea Team @ Viki

599
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,320
What happened? Wasn't it ten minutes?

600
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,730
Surprise! You were surprised, right?

601
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,260
Nice to meet you.

602
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,050
Thank you.

603
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,750
Mrs. Taylor, you look younger.

604
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,170
What about me?

605
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,810
It's not possible that you don't remember me, right?

606
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:45,170
Mrs. Bakhandel, you've gotten so pretty I didn't recognize you.

607
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,030
You are indeed the best Chef Gwon.

608
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,890
Yes, that's right.

609
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,460
Since when?

610
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,650
How did you find out?

611
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,080
Yesterday at the restaurant, you left this.

612
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,900
Prosopagnosia isn't an illness that you should be embarrassed about.

613
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,010
Don't be arrogant.

614
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,510
Because I like Chef.

615
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,180
Because Chef, you are my mentor and ideal guy.

616
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,070
I'm sorry.

617
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,060
I didn't try to listen on purpose.

618
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,070
Kim Ha Ni

619
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,570
Kim Ha Ni

620
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,210
Hey.

621
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,990
I won't kick you out.

622
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,520
Move!

623
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,130
Antena?

624
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:08,940
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Under The Sea Team @ Viki

625
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,870
Now a days, you have to be hired to even date.

626
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,770
Don't think about anything and get hired.

627
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,630
Okay?

628
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,880
Okay.

629
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,290
There aren't people at Hongdae at this time.

630
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,570
Iron Man.

631
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,600
It's ruined. He hasn't even read it.

632
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,330
Yes, Grandmother?

633
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,150
Who?

634
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:05,490
Yes.

635
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,740
Thank you very much. (Japanese)

636
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,340
- Here it is.
- Thank you!

637
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,360
Thank you very much! (Japanese)

638
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,080
Is that so?

639
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,570
Ah, yes!

640
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,890
Come here quickly.

641
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,050
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

642
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,490
She's the JH Company CEO.

643
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,430
Hey, say something that makes sense.

644
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,330
Look. She looks the same, she looks the same.

645
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,350
Look at her. Look at her.

646
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,040
Hey, you! Hey, you!

647
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,600
What is it? Where are you going right now?

648
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,540
Aish, seriously. Hurry up and come out.

649
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,290
You are really

650
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,700
I'm not doing it. So go, just go.

651
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,540
Come here.

652
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,790
What are they doing? Who is doing this?

653
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:44,370
When?

654
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,920
What's the matter?

655
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,710
Witch Ahn.

656
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,660
Oh my, I thought you said you were sick.

657
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,000
What do you mean 'sick'?

658
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,580
Princess, am I sick?

659
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,350
Over there...isn't that Sunbaenim?

660
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,230
You are seriously!

661
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,790
Why aren't you going out?

662
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:44,260
Come out! Come out here!

663
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,540
Hurry.

664
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,100
Aigoo, why are you like this seriously?

665
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:01,000
The truck...truck.

666
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,500
Why are you drinking alone?

667
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:17,250
Fourteen years ago.

668
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,660
You're can't?

669
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,660
What are you doing? Oppa made ramyun for us.

670
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,370
Aish, I got it.

671
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,900
Alright.

672
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,190
What?

673
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:34,050
Hey, idiot. How many times do I have to tell you?

674
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:40,000
The reason why a man won't answer your calls is only one reason,

675
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,790
because he doesn't like you.

676
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,200
Don't mess around. I asked it's not like that.

677
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,000
- It's right though.
- It's not!

678
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,450
Why aren't you answering?!

679
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,980
♫ I know the way that we collide ♫

680
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,350
Hello?!

681
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,950
Hello?

682
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,200
Hello?
