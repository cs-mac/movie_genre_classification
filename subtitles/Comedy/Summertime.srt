1
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,960
Hey, excuse me.

2
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,253
I beg your pardon.

3
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,761
Hold on this for a second,
would you please?

4
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,091
Yes, certainly.

5
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,131
Lift a little closer, you don't mind.

6
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,269
Up a little higher.

7
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,430
Thanks. Now, still.

8
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,507
This is Venice we coming into, lsn't it?

9
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,679
Yes, we will be there about two minutes.

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,710
This is the lagoon.

11
00:01:54,914 --> 00:02:00,875
Oh, boy! Gotta get a shot of this.

12
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:08,318
Each one of these I used already.
Haven't even gotten there yet.

13
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:12,487
Oh, thanks a lot.

14
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,900
Is this your first visit to Venice?
Yes. Is it yours?

15
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,970
No. I've been here several times.

16
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,267
Several times, you have.

17
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,274
Yes. I hope you will like it.

18
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,504
Like it? I got to.

19
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,342
I come such a long way

20
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,348
I saved for a long time for this trip.

21
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,647
You think I maybe won't like it.

22
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,153
I'm sure you will.

23
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,383
But not everybody
likes it in the same way.

24
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,653
Some people find it too quiet,
some people find it too noisy.

25
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:48,823
And it is very noisy.
but the majority find it very beautiful.

26
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,438
Well, I guess
I'll settle with the majority.

27
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,010
Here we are.

28
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,288
(ltalian)

29
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,989
Taxi.
No taxi. Gondola.

30
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,966
How much, gondola?
A thousand lira.

31
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:37,632
How much, bus?
20 lira.

32
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,047
(ltalian.)

33
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,849
Where bus?
There.

34
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,016
Is that the bus?

35
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,884
How much?

36
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,363
Have a good time.

37
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,773
Hello there.
Hi.

38
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,283
Where're you from?
I'm from Ohio. How do you do?

39
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:58,753
My name is Lloyd Mcllenny from lllinois.

40
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,917
This is Mrs. Mcllenny.

41
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:09,229
I'm Jane Hudson. Excuse me.

42
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,427
Is that wonderful?
Yeah, I guess so.

43
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,232
Why? Don't you like Venice, Mr. Mclhenny?

44
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:20,902
It's just a city.
Now, Lloyd.

45
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:28,617
Are you going to Hon from here?
Sure. Next stop, Parks.

46
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,790
That's name the ltalians are giving them
We're doing all in ltaly.

47
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:37,190
Rome, Naples, Napoli, Carpi,
got off at Spain, Portugal and home.

48
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:43,358
Fine home came over by boat.

49
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:51,535
Yes, We've been to lreland, Scotland.
England, London, the Queen.

50
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,541
Adorable
France, Paris.

51
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,206
Yes, Paris.
Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria.

52
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,955
Southberry Festival
Switzerland. Here we are in Venice.

53
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,283
Some itinerary.
How long have you been at it?

54
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,392
We started off 1 0:30 A.M. on June 1 5.

55
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,461
When do you fly from....
September 9th.

56
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,633
This year?

57
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:20,862
Well, what do you know?

58
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,095
Our travel agent did a crackerjack job.

59
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,530
They planned every step of the way.
Take a look at this.

60
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:56,766
Here is today's itinerary.
8 A.M. breakfast, 1 0, St. Marco Cathedral

61
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,241
1 0:30 to 1 2:30, l.A.
I.A. What's that?

62
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:05,907
Independent actvity.
We're allowed 2 hours of it everyday.

63
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,953
That's really something to take.
I guess it is kind of unique.

64
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,822
You see, Miss. Hudson,
this is our first trip abroad.

65
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,158
Mr. Mcllenny retires this year
and we don't have any children.

66
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,828
So we just decided
to have our little flame.

67
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,043
Where're you stopping, Miss. Hudson?
At Pensioni Fiorini.

68
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,911
What do you know?
We're there though.

69
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,814
Isn't that nice?
We're now coming along to Pensioni right now.

70
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:54,015
We gonna stop at Titian Pertitian,
It's the cuttest shop.Just cute

71
00:09:54,226 --> 00:10:01,689
Here's your stopping off place
coming up now, Miss. Hudson.

72
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,665
Put them down there, dear.
One moment, Miss. Hudson.

73
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:11,332
I'm terribly sorry.
I know they weigh a ton.

74
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,312
Pensioni Fiorini.

75
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,585
Thank you.

76
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,390
Hi.

77
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,561
Hi.

78
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,353
Hello. I'm Jane Hudson.

79
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:13,863
My travel agent must've sent a wire from
Of course, Miss. Hudson.

80
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,900
We have your room.
Would you register, please?

81
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,301
Here. Just your name,
where you from and passport number.

82
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,168
So hot.
Yes, it's very hot.

83
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,502
I'll fill in the rest.

84
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,236
Thank you.

85
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,075
Giovanna.

86
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,582
My husband used to say:
If you are not gonna fire her, the least

87
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,584
you can do is to strangle her.

88
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,350
You speak English so well.
Thank you, but don't worry, Giovanna

89
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,519
doesn't speak one word.

90
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,433
Let me help her. They're too heavy.
No, she is strong like an ox.

91
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,537
I'll take this other stuff.
Thank you.

92
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,402
That's our dining room.
Here we have our sitting room.

93
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,674
Would you coming please.
Thank you.

94
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:08,752
Oh boy! This is lovely!
Good. Would you give your things.

95
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:13,323
Oh thanks. I'm so happy to be here.
Instead of a hotel full of

96
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,485
tourists, like me.

97
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:22,323
Excuse me one moment.

98
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,907
Wow!

99
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,983
Do you know Bourbon?
Oh yes.

100
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,959
I smuggled it in. It's very good whisky.

101
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,190
You want some ice?
No. Thank you. I'm determined

102
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,326
to learn to drink without it.

103
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,959
You 're very willing.
Completely.

104
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:58,263
Half ltalian. Half American.

105
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:05,101
Is this your first day in Europe?
How did you guess?

106
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,144
You traveling all alone?
I like it.

107
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,306
I would hate it.
I'm an independent type. Always have been.

108
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:17,979
You're a writer?
No. Fancy secretary, really.

109
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,259
Cheers!

110
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:30,193
This is nice. I keep saying that.
I don't mind.

111
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:34,839
This is my business.
Here's my home for many years.

112
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,445
When my husband died in a war,
this place has been Pensioni.

113
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,875
I enjoyed it, though.

114
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,074
And it's very pleasant
to make money without moving.

115
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,049
Oh, hi.
Ths is Miss. Hudson.

116
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,018
I'm Phyl Yaeger.
Hello, cookie.

117
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,884
Be seeing you.

118
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,390
Cute.
Yes.

119
00:14:55,594 --> 00:15:03,057
Don't you want to see your room?
Thank you.

120
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:14,435
This heat does things to me.

121
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:20,078
He is an artist.
He has been here for sometime.

122
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,145
When she is not singing,
she is playing that terrible machine.

123
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,824
I like the singing. I like the machine.
It's ltaly, isn't it?

124
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,185
Is it?
To me.

125
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,831
I put you high up,
so yo can have plenty of air.

126
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,493
Thank you.
It can be very hot, you know.

127
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,966
Across the lagoon, you can see Murad,

128
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,698
That's where they make the glass.

129
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:49,814
Here you have quite a nice view.

130
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,785
Thank you!
For what?

131
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,588
For this.

132
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,928
You know
I met a girl on the boat coming over,

133
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,899
In America,
every female under 50 calls herself a girl.

134
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,096
Really?
Who cares.

135
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:21,473
Anyway, this girl on boat was waiting.
For what?

136
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,545
She was going to Europe to find something

137
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,684
That was way back in the back of her mind.

138
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,412
Part seeing things and getting
some culture that was about here.

139
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,149
Perfume about here,
let it loose for once about....

140
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,319
We won't go into that, but....
way back, way way back in the back

141
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,967
of her mind
was something she was looking for....

142
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,628
What?
A wonderful, mystical, magical miracle.

143
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,608
To do what?

144
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:58,383
Beats me. I guess to find
what she's been missing all her life.

145
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:03,419
Well. I better take a shower.
Yes.

146
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:09,822
Gallaria at Dermania and the church of..
What is it?

147
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,463
They're all alike to me.
You should see the Bianelli.

148
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,064
Pardon?
That's the big artist.

149
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,360
If I have one more
look at a painting, I yip.

150
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,436
Excuse me, but
Mrs. Yaeger's husband is an artist.

151
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,107
Oh, well, say,
Pardon me, ma'am.

152
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,301
I don't understand pictures,
and I got bad feet to to standing.

153
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,844
I know how you feel.

154
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,141
When I first fell in love with Andy,

155
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,375
I just had to get to like pictures.

156
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,681
So I looked and looked,
and one day wonderful thing happened.

157
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,224
I knew what I was looking at. Kind of.

158
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,592
Would you have seen
any of Dieaga's painting?

159
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,892
He had a one-man show in New York.

160
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,932
He sold the painting to the Toledo Museum.

161
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,433
You must be very successful.

162
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,802
Successful?! That show was four years ago.

163
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,773
Well, come along.
Don't go. Let's have a drink.

164
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,607
I like to but
this nonsense is wrecking my digestion.

165
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:09,118
Pardon me, no disrespect for Tanniea.

166
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:13,815
You're always on the same line.

167
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,119
How to make friends and influence people.

168
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,886
I'm sure he
didn't know what he was saying.

169
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,966
Of course he didn't.
He is insensitive man. Has no heart. Not much.

170
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:27,605
He is one fool with miserable belly.
He probably likes French food.

171
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,637
I must say I did.

172
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:35,007
It's so refined. In ltaly,
you sit down to eat and eat a meal.

173
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:39,344
In Paris, you sit down, what do you eat?
A sauce.

174
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:44,079
In America, buy Mac, whatever it is,
he sits down,

175
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:49,556
What does he eat? Birds, only birds.

176
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,197
And you want me to get
excited about a man like that?

177
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,093
Good-by.

178
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,699
Have a drink.
No, thank you.

179
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:01,236
Drago? Is that right?
Right. C'mon, we gotta get going.

180
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,237
Cookie, have a drink.
That will do you good.

181
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,966
No thanks.
Drago before you go?

182
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,010
No, we're late for dinner.
We take you up on that drink, though.

183
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:13,913
Sure. Well, that leaves us.
Or does it? I guess it doesn't.

184
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,679
I'm dining with an old friend.
Would you care to come with us?

185
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,416
No, thank you.
When in ltaly, you should meet ltalians.

186
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:25,188
Mr. Ferstino is in the government.
Please join us.

187
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,922
Two is a company.
A sad sin.

188
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,899
Mr. Ferstino and I are,
for several years now,

189
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,164
We've been unexcited.

190
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,174
Well, pardon me.
Sure you won't have a short one?

191
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:46,341
I don't want it. Thank you.
May be I can persuade my self. Drago?

192
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:52,513
How do you pronounce that?

193
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,256
There are two people
back in the states I wish to hear.

194
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,829
They're darling couple.

195
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,196
Rather like the Yaegers, really.
Only older.

196
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,803
Not older than me.
Nobody is older than me.

197
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,270
I am. In ltaly, age is an asset.

198
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,911
If it is, I'm loaded.
Now you do have to go.

199
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,670
Are you sure you're not come with me?

200
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,341
No, thank you.
Okay.

201
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,320
There is no holding me.

202
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,820
I guess I'll have
dinner by myself tonight.

203
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,855
Don't let you on a rush.
No, indeed.

204
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,086
After sunset,
she rushes around like American.

205
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:35,096
She has a friend, Alfredo,
All day long, she is only recuperating

206
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,063
herself from the night before.

207
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,499
I should be so sick.

208
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:44,904
You know, Miss. Hudson, those miracles,
they can happen sometimes.

209
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,877
But you must give a little push to help.

210
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:55,976
I'm not used to say things like that.

211
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,455
Gondola, lady?

212
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:47,357
Are you looking for something, lady?

213
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,261
No, no.

214
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,567
Not today.

215
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,433
Tonight.
Not today, not tonight.

216
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,976
Tomorrow night is better than tonight.

217
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,115
Look,
you be a good boy and run along home.

218
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,844
Home? I got no home.
You mean you got no place to live?

219
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,353
I live in a boat. Postcard, lady?

220
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,617
Okay.

221
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:29,290
You take this and get some food with it
Some good nourishing food.

222
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:15,429
The famous Piazza.
Don't change a thing. Not one thing.

223
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,360
Waiter.

224
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,920
Smile, Lloyd, smile.

225
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,937
Well, I'm off.

226
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:25,866
Where you're going?
Shopping.

227
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,505
Buy myself, cookie.

228
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,511
Some for me?
I gave you yesterday.

229
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,184
Give me a cigarette?
You're too little to smoke.

230
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,047
But I smoke.
Not with my help.

231
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:42,716
Just one cigarette.
You know a sucker when you see one.

232
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:51,334
Easy does it.
Thank you.

233
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,062
You okay, lady.

234
00:32:56,274 --> 00:33:00,233
So long, cookie.

235
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,337
Does anyone here speak English?
Yes.

236
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,311
I wonder
if you can tell me the price of

237
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:16,783
that red goblet in the window?

238
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:22,449
One minute, please.
Thank you.

239
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,334
Good morning.
Good morning. I want to ask the price of this goblet.

240
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,804
For this? 1 0,000 liras.

241
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,978
It is aging.

242
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,407
May l?
Please.

243
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,052
It is very beautiful.

244
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,553
It is a very beautiful color.

245
00:34:53,758 --> 00:35:01,221
Perhaps you'll see the color better
if you took off your glasses.

246
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,900
Are you enjoying Venice?

247
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,600
Yes, I have, very much. Thank you.

248
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,244
It is heart of Venice to catch some.

249
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:20,907
Yes, I felt that.
You feel Venice. That's a wonderful feeling.

250
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,890
Have you a pair? Two?

251
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:31,551
No, I'm sorry.
This is the only one I have.

252
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,889
How much did you say it was?
To you, 1 0,000 liras. It is genuine.

253
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,332
Wrap it up. I'll take it.

254
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:45,475
You take it? At this price?
That is the price isn't it?

255
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:49,772
Excuse me, Miss.
Have you bought many things in ltaly?

256
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,782
No, I havn't. This is the first time.
I just came yesterday.

257
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:58,718
Forgive me. But in ltaly,
you must not say so quick" I take it."

258
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,153
You must bargain.
Why?

259
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,294
It is a part of buying and selling.

260
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,362
I'll give it you for 8,700 liras.

261
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,829
No, you don't.
Why?

262
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,025
Because it's not fair.
But I want to.

263
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,534
Yes, but I bought it for 1 0,000 lira.

264
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,607
Then I give it to you for
8,700 lira in honor of your first

265
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,903
buying in ltaly.

266
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,549
Well, I give in. I mean, I give up.

267
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,513
Thank you.
Very good.

268
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:32,917
I'll wrap it up.
You'll wrap it up.

269
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,093
Thank you.

270
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,620
Will you be staying long in Venice?

271
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:45,291
That depends.
I mean...I feel if I can stay forever.

272
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,531
That is a fact what it says.

273
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,642
By the way, if it were possible
to get another goblet,

274
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,779
Would you wish to have it?

275
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:01,441
Oh, yes.
I think it is possible I may find one.

276
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,819
Perhaps you would call again?

277
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,012
Or perhaps I could send it to your hotel?

278
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,192
Where you're staying?
In Venice.

279
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:12,260
What?
I mean, in Pensioni Fiorini.

280
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,590
Oh, yes.

281
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:18,667
Thank you.
Hope to see you again.

282
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,838
Thank you.

283
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,701
Thank you.

284
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,279
Thank you.
Your glasses.

285
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,144
You'll wear it or carry it?

286
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,116
Carry them. Thank you.

287
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,781
Good-by.
Good-by.

288
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,500
Dearest Ben and Betty:
Venice is as unbelievable as fairy tale,

289
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:01,041
How I wish you're here.

290
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:07,206
This time, we'll be a quartet.

291
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:13,980
Mio Amico has silver-gray hair.

292
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,924
Cookie, you're a very pretty girl.

293
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,722
Yes. I know.

294
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:24,094
But I'm not interested
in looking like the women in paintings.

295
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,429
You are.
C'mon.

296
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,798
No, You are.

297
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:33,238
What's the matter?
Nothing.

298
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:38,882
Someday when you're not so busy,
how about you showing me the town.

299
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,551
I've been hurrying for ten minutes.

300
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,878
I'll call a boat.
Ok.

301
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:46,523
We could go swimming.
Sure.

302
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:51,525
We're out to Harry's bar.
The book says that's a must.

303
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,822
Ok.

304
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,761
Will you excuse us?
Sure. Have fun.

305
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,798
Be seeing you.
Yes.

306
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,463
Bye.
Bye.

307
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,979
Hey! Why don't l
give Harry his big break tonight.

308
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,246
Do you mind if I come along with you?
I always buy my guy a drink.

309
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,886
Sure.
We'll meet some people.

310
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,922
How about bring them, too?
Are there too many of them?

311
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,219
Just another couple.
We're going on to dinner together.

312
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,329
Sure. Have fun.

313
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:31,991
Oh, Eddie.
Miss. Hudson.

314
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,953
Coffee.

315
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,678
Good evening.
Good evening.

316
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,114
You frightened me.
How did you know I was here?

317
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,291
(ltalian.)

318
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,096
Oh, I like it this way.

319
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,595
Lady, you got any brothers and sisters?

320
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,324
Three, cookie.

321
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:37,474
You very lucky. Three brothers
and sisters. I got three of these.

322
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,076
Presents. Souvenirs of ltaly.

323
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,508
You're impossible.

324
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:47,810
Ok. Ok.
Now, look. Cookie, I'm lost.

325
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,977
Do you know Campos St. Bonavus?
Yes.

326
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:57,650
You take me there. Ok?
Yes, Miss.

327
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:07,226
I wash face. You want to wash face?
Ok. I'll wash my face, too.

328
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,573
Wonderful!

329
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:16,735
C'mon. Iet's go.

330
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:47,468
Your legs gone, lady?

331
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:53,583
You say the cuttest things.

332
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:59,319
Look, take that and that. All that.
And you stay here.

333
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:02,492
Ok.

334
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:23,145
Very difficult for ladies.

335
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,180
I'm now going to take a picture.

336
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:30,843
Okey-doke.
Okey-doke. That's about it.

337
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:41,254
You're in the way.
You don't want my picture, lady?

338
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,303
What's it for?

339
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,732
I'm trying to
take the picture of that shop.

340
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,307
Sometimes, I think you're very peculiar.

341
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,968
Thanks, cookie.

342
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:00,150
Ok. Shoot.

343
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,442
Look. Coming here.

344
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,089
Be a good boy. Stand over there.
Don't move and shut up.

345
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:11,250
Go ahead. Now. Stop. Ok.

346
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:03,077
You should've seen me in the Olympics.

347
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,249
Skip it.

348
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,003
Mauro! Mauro!

349
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,171
Here, lady.
Take me home.

350
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,343
Ok, lady.

351
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:17,181
Good afternoon. How are you?
Not so bad. I fell into the canal.

352
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,250
Oh yes, I'm so sorry.

353
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,516
You played hooky this afternoon.
I played hooky?

354
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,760
I was at your shop.
Didn't the boy tell you?

355
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,398
Yes. Yes.
He is very kind.

356
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,226
He is my niece.
Nephew.

357
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:36,065
Nephew. Of course. Just when I think
I speak English like the

358
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,639
American, something happens.

359
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:41,743
Anyhow, he is the son of my eldest sister.

360
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:49,408
Bravo! That about concludes
my entire performance in ltalian.

361
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,386
Should I call somebody for you?

362
00:49:56,593 --> 00:50:00,586
Who?
I don't know. Mrs. Fiorini?

363
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,698
I scarcely know her.

364
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,631
Do you want to go somewhere?
No.

365
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,797
I came to see you.

366
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:18,213
Oh, you found another goblet.
No. Unfortunately, no.

367
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:23,409
There are not many old goblets
in Venice any more. But we'll look.

368
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:30,082
Don't go for any trouble.
For you? It is no trouble.

369
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,163
May we go in?

370
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,600
Sure.

371
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:52,381
It's very hot.
Yes.

372
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:03,025
That's better, isn't it?
Mr. Rossi, why did you come to see me?

373
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,217
It is of nature.

374
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:08,921
You don't give up something you like.
No.

375
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,965
So I came.
Why?

376
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,605
Does it matter why? You knew I would.

377
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,434
I did not.

378
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:21,634
How can I explain?
May be it's my English.

379
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,245
May be it's mine.

380
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:29,545
Listen. Two nights ago I went to
Piazza St. Marco. You were there.

381
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,086
We looked. Next day, you were in my shop.

382
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,453
We talked about glasses.
We talked about Venice.

383
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,528
But we were not speak about that. Are we?

384
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:47,465
So last night I was in St.Marco again.
You were at St. Marco again.

385
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:51,004
Half of Venice are at St. Marco again.

386
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:55,838
But half of Venice are not in my shop,
or I'll be a rich man.

387
00:51:56,046 --> 00:52:00,380
I wanted to buy another glass.
That's all

388
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,609
There are shops all over Venice.

389
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,983
Did you looking
at any of them for your glass?

390
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,420
No.
You see?

391
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,493
But you said you'll find one for me.

392
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,460
That's why you came back?
Yes.

393
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:19,066
Not that reason.

394
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,831
I don't know what your experience
has been with American tourists.

395
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,103
My experience has been that
tourist have more experience than l.

396
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,907
Can we sit down?
No.

397
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,913
I've offended you?

398
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,916
Oh, yes. You're sorry I'm here.

399
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,419
Then you're glad?

400
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:46,893
It may be so to you, but I'm not
an ltalian. I'm an American,

401
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:49,429
I thought everything
happens so fast in America.

402
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:53,194
Not this sort of thing. Not to me.

403
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:56,770
Yes. I have offended you.

404
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:02,172
Mr. Rossi, I'm not a child.
But I don't understand.

405
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:07,043
Understand? Why must you understand?

406
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,243
The most beautiful things
in life are those we don't understand.

407
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:16,187
As we spoke yesterday,
I knew you're simpatico.

408
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:19,191
Is that something you understand?

409
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,990
Yes, it means I'm like a sister to you.

410
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,533
I have four sisters
and I'm not looking for another.

411
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:31,332
Stop. You can make a joke.

412
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:39,004
You make many jokes but inside.
I think you can.

413
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:47,512
That's why you're simpatico.

414
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:58,357
Miss. Hudson,
you ask me why I came to see you.

415
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:03,801
Because you attract me. Why?

416
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:07,033
Because you do.

417
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:11,704
You Americans
are even more suspicious than French.

418
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:18,484
Listen. We saw each other.
We like each other.

419
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,521
This is so nice.

420
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:25,684
How can it be wrong?

421
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:34,995
Would you do me the honor
of seeing me this evening?

422
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,766
Hello! Miss. Hudson. What a day we have.

423
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,773
We've been shopping.
No, let them guess.

424
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:46,210
This is Mr. Rossi.
Mr. and Mrs. Mcllenny.

425
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:50,785
How are you?
Fine, thank you.

426
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:54,150
It's so nice to be ltalian in ltaly.

427
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:57,520
Glad to know you, Mr. Rossi.
How do you do?

428
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,321
It's hot. I guess
we kind of overrun our schedule.

429
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,693
What did you buy?
Glass, glass and more glass.

430
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,992
She even sent home a chandelier.

431
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,897
And before that, we did
the glass factory, picture gallery, the

432
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:13,064
whole works. The pictures were marvelous
you tell them.

433
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,574
Yes, she is right.
That place certainly sold me art.

434
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,542
It gotta be fine art.
Oh, yes.

435
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:21,513
That you gotta see, Miss. Hudson.
Come rain or snow, you gotta see.

436
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,687
Oh boy, pictures. Rooms full of pictures.

437
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,789
Hundreds of pictures. All done by hand.

438
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:32,519
And the cuttest glass.
C'mon, I just gotta show you.

439
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,754
Over there, so pretty, Lloyd.

440
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,159
What are they?
Benetian glass.

441
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:41,667
Please don't bother to unwrap it.
It'no bother. I'll show you one.

442
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:45,500
And you gotta do this please.
You stand right there and watch them

443
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:49,475
They put this stuff on long poles
and they heat it to the furnace.

444
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,412
And presto change glass! And such colors.

445
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:59,316
You have no idea. There!

446
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,481
Isn't that exquisite?

447
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,854
Stunning!

448
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:09,657
Oddly enough.
I was looking for one just like it.

449
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,891
They're only too
happy to make them for you.

450
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,593
I bought half a dozen.

451
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,102
They practically making them
for you while you stand there.

452
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,831
If I may ask, how much did you pay?

453
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,636
Not too much.
Lloyd, honestly.

454
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,678
You know they wanted 1 1,500 lira a piece
But you never give them

455
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,712
what they want.

456
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,646
You just beat them down every time....

457
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:34,620
I'm terribly sorry.
No, ltalians love to bargain.

458
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,054
How much did you pay finally?

459
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,229
Well, 1 0,000.

460
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,122
It's fair.

461
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:46,132
Oh we missed something.
We never got around the National Library.

462
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:51,638
We can get that over with
in morning before we catch the train.

463
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:59,304
Sometimes I think the schedule
in Venice is just, well, all wrong.

464
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:03,946
There you go.
Why! Thank you.

465
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:07,123
(ltalian)

466
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:23,837
I know a little shop where
Mrs. Mcllenny could've saved 7,800 lira.

467
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,531
I didn't say
your glass which was made yesterday.

468
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,803
Of course not. It was 1 8 century, cookie.

469
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:30,945
Do not call me cookie.

470
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,945
It's politer than some
other names that come to mind.

471
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,447
Now you're angry.
No.

472
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:38,985
Suspicious again.
Angry, no. Suspicious, yes.

473
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,054
You can always
find something to be suspicious of.

474
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,122
Well I can and this doesn't help.
Suspicious.....

475
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:49,287
What do you want me to do?

476
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,067
Benetian glass
the same design used over and over

477
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,758
for years and years.

478
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,461
Your goblet is aging centuries.

479
00:57:56,673 --> 00:58:02,634
You can't believe me, you're not.

480
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:09,073
Now please, believe me.

481
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:14,587
If you do me the honor
of taking confidant tonight?

482
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:18,921
There is a concert tonight.

483
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,120
Would you like to go?

484
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:28,293
He is beginning music with someone.

485
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,398
Relax.

486
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:34,771
Relax and the world is beautiful.

487
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:38,937
Take a deep breath.

488
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,320
There.

489
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,985
There is not very much
to have confidence in me, is it?

490
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:53,595
No.
What happens after that.....happens.

491
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:58,890
Does not happen.

492
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,634
This is all and
more than I ever dreamed of.

493
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:41,497
Back in Akron.

494
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,729
You're a surprising person.

495
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,408
Surprising?
Uh-hum.

496
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:49,840
Every woman should
surprise a man at least once

497
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,310
How many times have I surprised you?

498
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,279
I think you surprise me all the time.

499
01:00:55,485 --> 01:01:02,550
Sometimes, you surprise me.
Pleasantly?

500
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:07,219
Well....
Here is, to many pleasant surprises.

501
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:29,777
Which flower do you prefer?

502
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:32,386
Which one do you think I should have?

503
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,614
Choose.
I think I know which one you choose

504
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:39,056
You do? Perhaps I might surprise you.

505
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:42,060
Perhaps. Choose.

506
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,234
Perhaps not.

507
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,962
Surprised?
I'm afraid so.

508
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:54,143
Thank you.

509
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,475
Which flower
did you think I would choose?

510
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:06,144
The rose? the carnation?
Oh, dear, I should've known.

511
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,090
For once, I wasn't the touring American.

512
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:13,285
Why did you choose that flower?

513
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,897
I once went to a ball.

514
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,002
Not just the ordinary dance,
but a real ball.

515
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,173
It was the first one I ever been to.

516
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:29,276
Somehow, I got it into my mind
that I had to wear gardenia.

517
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,208
I don't know why.

518
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,110
I guess I read about
gardenia in a book or something.

519
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,285
I must have it.
I didn't even know what to wear.

520
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,819
Did you wear one?

521
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:44,425
Gardenias turned out
to cost two dollars a piece.

522
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:48,290
And the boy I was
going with was still in college.

523
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,467
It was nice theme.

524
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:55,603
Well, now you have your gardenia.

525
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:58,774
Yes.

526
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:06,370
Everything happens sooner or later.

527
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:12,315
Yes. That's what they say.

528
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:18,483
Everything happens to him who waits.

529
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:28,526
Let's take a walk.
Alright.

530
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:57,991
That's where I was born.

531
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:00,935
You see the window?
With a basket of flowers?

532
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:05,471
Oh, yes.
Sixty four steps up. I used to count them.

533
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,240
That was a lot of steps.

534
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:12,337
It's still is.
I went back there a year ago.

535
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,596
What are they doing?
Is it a festival or something?

536
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,297
No. They're just having fun.

537
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:43,239
They'll have supper somewhere
on the canal. They'll sing songs.

538
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:50,852
Look the stars, and perhaps,
Well, it is dark on the canal.

539
01:04:57,827 --> 01:05:05,290
I'll catch it from the steps.
It doesn't matter.

540
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:34,863
Oh, Renato!

541
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:51,178
You're home.

542
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,011
Say it again.
Say what?

543
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,189
My name.

544
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,159
Why did you do that?

545
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,630
Why!
Yes. Why did you do that? Like that.

546
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,063
I don't think I want to see you again.

547
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:18,730
You don't?
Oh, but l......

548
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,483
I love you.

549
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:34,579
Tomorrow.
Eight.

550
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:17,632
Hey! Lady.

551
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:24,030
You're supposed to
come this morning. Remember?

552
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,732
I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry.

553
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:33,404
If you're really sorry
you buy Swiss watch, 1 0 dollars.

554
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,019
I must fly.
Where're you going?

555
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,381
I have an appointment.

556
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:44,355
Take my cordo. Lady.

557
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:50,192
I must've forgotten that, too.

558
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,368
Crazy!

559
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,849
(ltalian)

560
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:49,824
Do you really think so?
Yes, Yes.

561
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:26,059
Miss. Hudson.
Oh, it's you.

562
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,321
Good evening. I bring a message.

563
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,021
Mr. Rossi can't make it.

564
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:35,693
Oh no, he'll be here.
But he must be little late.

565
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,732
It was very nice
of you to come and tell me.

566
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,740
Not at all.
Won't you have some coffee?

567
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,879
No, thank you.

568
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,980
Please sit down.

569
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,310
Thank you.

570
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,611
Cigarette?
American?

571
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,152
Yes.
Thank you.

572
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,449
American cigarettes are marvelous.

573
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:02,495
But I'll save it for later,
if you don't mind. Permit me.

574
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:07,567
Do you like working for Mr. Rossi?
Very much.

575
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,330
Do you think he is a nice man?

576
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:15,306
Yes. He is great..Iike God, for you, too.

577
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:19,607
You don't know how upset
he was when he knew you'd be late.

578
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:24,275
He didn't want to be.
My youngest sister, she was little ill,

579
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:28,115
It was nothing really,
he worries so much about the same thing.

580
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:31,020
He does.
Always.

581
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,525
He worries about whose children?

582
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:38,189
His. Us.
Us? Who are us?

583
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:43,294
I'm the oldest. Vito.

584
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,305
And how is your mother?
Fine. Thank you.

585
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:51,411
So am l. Except the hole in my head.

586
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,241
Excuse me, please. My English is not....

587
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:59,285
Sorry. I think you better
tell your father not to come.

588
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,615
But it won't be long.
No, no, it's alright.

589
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,189
Just tell him not to come.

590
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:08,830
Perhaps I tell him tomorow night.
No. Thank you for your trouble.

591
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:13,491
Good-by.
Good-by.

592
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,848
Hello.

593
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:38,026
Oh, hello.

594
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:42,022
What's the matter with you?
Marriage troubles.

595
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:45,598
I wish I had them. Matter of fact, I do.

596
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:50,204
Here you go.
Thanks.

597
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:56,367
Cry again.
You cry. I'm sunk.

598
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:01,172
Not you.
Not me!? I'm feeling miserable.

599
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,718
But everybody loves you.
I know.

600
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,410
They do.
I don't want everybody.

601
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,487
I can't handle the crowd.

602
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:13,628
I can't even handle.....Here I go again.

603
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:19,233
Everything goes crazy for me.
Everything always is crazy.

604
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:22,529
I got to be everything.

605
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:25,172
You got to be everything?
Is that crazy?

606
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:30,641
Yeah, that's crazy. Two of you, cookie.

607
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,474
What do you mean?
Two. That's lovely isn't......

608
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,546
Don't push your luck too far.

609
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,878
Everything doesn't go crazy,
you just ask too much.

610
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,079
What's the matter? What did I say?

611
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:45,784
Nothing. I'm teribly sorry.
Nothing. It's me.

612
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:49,691
Something happened to you?
No, no, nothing happened to me.

613
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:55,302
That's my history.
Have stale potato chips.

614
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:22,563
Listen. I don't love you.
Who asked?

615
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:28,704
It was very pleasant time we had.

616
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:33,598
Mauro!
Gondola.

617
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,397
Where did you get that for?
It's mine.

618
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,905
Where did you get that for? That's dirty.

619
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,840
I want it.
Is that what you do? Is that your work?

620
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:16,450
What's matter? What's matter?
Stop that! you hear? You stop that!

621
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:21,851
What did he do?
That was too...he is just a baby, a child.

622
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:29,520
I thought you like the child.
What's matter? You crazy?

623
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,807
Something happens to this city at night.

624
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,275
Are you going to get away from Venice?

625
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:49,110
Your friend with in Kansas City.
Not in a gondola.

626
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,479
That's ungratitude Venice.

627
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,451
Jane.
Don't call me Jane.

628
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,317
Miss. Hudson, you're shocked.

629
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,459
Disappointed.
No, shocked.

630
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:58,955
I don't like dishonesty.
You're not his wife.

631
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:06,929
Why didn't you tell me you're married?

632
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:11,401
I see.
Why?

633
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:13,268
Why?

634
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,774
I was afraid.
I was afraid if you knew too soon,

635
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:21,939
It'll end us before we begin.
Now, I'm afraid I was right.

636
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,415
No wonder
you approve of that sort of thing.

637
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:29,819
Approve?
What Ms. Fiorini does is not my business.

638
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,823
She leaves, I leave. I approve of leaving

639
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:35,053
Pretending everything is fine and dandy,

640
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,095
Just because you want to do it.

641
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,733
You Americans get so disturbed about sex.

642
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:46,397
We don't take it lightly.
Take it, don't talk it.

643
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,471
My wife and I don't live together.

644
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:55,139
Why?
Why? It is an arrangement.

645
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,947
Does your wife have friends?

646
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,679
Naturally.
Gondola friends?

647
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,858
No.

648
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,549
You're shocked.
No. Disappointed.

649
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,992
No. Shocked.
Your sense of humor is coming back. Good.

650
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:11,961
I'm sorry, yours is leaving.
Listen to me. Stop.

651
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,691
You behave like a schoolgirl.

652
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,961
What my wife does
is none of your business.

653
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:18,765
What Ms. Fiorini does
is none of your business.

654
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:20,441
You come here and what you do?

655
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:25,011
You ride in gondola,
Oh Venice, so beautiful, so romantic.

656
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:28,410
Oh, these ltalians,
so lyrical, so romantic.

657
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:35,022
You dream of meeting someone you want.
Young, rich, witty

658
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,248
And unmarried, of course.

659
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:43,193
But me, I'm a shopkeeper.
Not young. Not rich. Not witty

660
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:46,367
And married, of course.

661
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:50,732
I'm a man and you're a woman.

662
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:56,571
Don't you see? It's wrong.
That's the way it is.

663
01:16:56,778 --> 01:17:00,714
You're like a hungry child.
Was given ravioli to eat.

664
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:06,080
No, you say, I want beefsteak.

665
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:13,751
My dear girl, you're hungry.
Eat that ravioli.

666
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:19,490
I'm not that hungry.
We're all the time, Miss. Hudson.

667
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:28,040
There is noise in your head.
Be quiet. Let it happen.

668
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,677
I want it to happen.

669
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:34,076
I want it to happen.
Don't you think I do?

670
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:36,477
Then?
It's just.....

671
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:41,349
Isn't the way I thought it would be.
I'm sorry.

672
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:45,287
But l...come from
such a different world, and I'm not

673
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,553
Going to be here long.

674
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:53,167
So it is better
to take home when you have it.

675
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:08,913
If you really not so hungry,
you do that very well.

676
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,675
Do l?

677
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:12,615
Yes.

678
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:14,618
Let me take you outside.
No.

679
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:19,283
Please.
No. I'm gonna go for a walk alone.

680
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,970
Please leave me alone.

681
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:32,940
It is very difficult.

682
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,309
Let me take you to a drink.
No.

683
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:42,746
At least something to eat.
No.

684
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:50,357
There are fireworks tonight.
I don't care.

685
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:05,129
This is ridiculous.

686
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,276
I'm afraid it is.

687
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:16,340
Gondola, sir?
No.

688
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:51,702
Do you know the words?
Yes. This song says....

689
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,273
I know what it says.

690
01:21:54,476 --> 01:22:00,381
Have you ever had it in America?
No.

691
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:04,109
You sing it.
How do you know I can?

692
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:09,890
Because you're ltalian.

693
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,099
(ltalian)

694
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:42,024
They call it Fangela Coppoli.
What does that mean?

695
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:48,191
The island where the rainbow fell.

696
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:49,462
It's very late. We ought to go.

697
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:53,394
Are you asleep?
Fast asleep.

698
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:57,367
You slept all day yesterday.
True

699
01:27:57,572 --> 01:28:03,010
You sleep all day and
you don't want to sleep at night.

700
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:11,518
You promised to take me to see
sights and now it's too late.

701
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,949
I'll take you tomorrow.

702
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:21,852
You promise?
No.

703
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:27,568
Now, do you promise?
It is difficult.

704
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:31,227
If you don't, I'll never kiss you again.

705
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:34,441
Yes, you will.

706
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:39,846
Yes. I guess so.

707
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:53,976
They're getting to know us.
You asked them to play it.

708
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:57,191
I did.

709
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:46,439
You're far away.

710
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:50,576
I'm very close.

711
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:54,914
What are you thinking?

712
01:30:56,350 --> 01:31:00,787
I was thinking
the first evening I came here.

713
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:08,929
First time I saw you,
you were wearing that yellow tie.

714
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:19,429
I don't want to forget any of it.
Not a single moment.

715
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:28,382
I don't think I ever shall.

716
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,817
I could go for a little walk.
Take us somewhere quiet.

717
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:39,356
Somewhere that is you.

718
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:45,499
I think you're going to surprise me again.

719
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:18,794
Listen, Renato. I'm leaving today.

720
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,198
I'm all packed.
My train leaves in two hours.

721
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:26,032
I don't believe you.

722
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,107
You have to believe me, because it's true.

723
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:33,110
What have I done?

724
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:35,646
Nothing.

725
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:38,978
What made you change your mind?

726
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:46,490
Well...I hadn't a mind change.
Really, I just found it.

727
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:48,924
I haven't made you unhappy.

728
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:53,829
No. You haven't. It's the happiest
time I had in my whole life.

729
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:58,836
You must believe that, please.
Why throw it away?

730
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:04,239
Because we have to. Because it's wrong.

731
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:09,678
Because you and l
will only end in nothing.

732
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:13,047
I love you, Jane.

733
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,415
You don't have to say that.

734
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:17,682
I mean it.

735
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:20,656
I shall always love you.

736
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:24,797
Yes. If I go.....

737
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,194
All my life, I stayed
at parties too long, because

738
01:33:28,402 --> 01:33:31,030
I didn't know when to go.

739
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:34,207
Now with you, I've grown up.

740
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:37,172
I think I do know when to.

741
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:41,872
I can't bear it if you go today.
I can't bear it, either.

742
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:47,487
Just a few days.
No. I couldn't. Then I never go.

743
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:53,593
Please. No. Take me to the station.

744
01:33:54,662 --> 01:34:00,623
Oh, no no, please. Please help me.

745
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:18,085
Let me go by myself.
Don't go, please.

746
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:23,356
Please don't go.

747
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:26,660
Let me go.

748
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:31,927
I must catch that train.
I'll take you to the station.

749
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:35,466
No, that's just what
I don't want you to do.

750
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,639
Oh, Renato.

751
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:37,297
Mauro!

752
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:39,691
What are you doing here?

753
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:43,358
I come to say good-by.

754
01:35:43,604 --> 01:35:48,871
I'm sorry, Mauro, I'm very, very sorry.
Ok, ok.

755
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:52,170
You going to Rome?
I'm going home.

756
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:53,971
To America?
Yes.

757
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:57,844
You come back again?
Yeah, yeah, sure.

758
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:01,249
You come back with a big American man?

759
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:04,618
I'll be your guide.
Ok.

760
01:36:04,825 --> 01:36:08,488
Want this?
No, thank you.

761
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:14,635
It's not for sale. It's a present.

762
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:19,406
Why?
Because I like you.

763
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:26,911
You okey-doke, lady?
Sure, I'm okey-doke.

764
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:31,574
Be seeing you.
Be seeing you.

765
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:44,898
Thank you.

766
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:46,993
Renato!
