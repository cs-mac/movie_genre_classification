Shit! You see that?

The commander, fired on unarmed residents here at 9 o'clock.

37
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:58,938
He departed.

38
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,501
Then.

39
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:28,931
Keep moving!

40
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,042
I would arrive late.

41
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,488
Telepon nanti.

42
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:05,802
General Garrison?

43
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,240
No, thank you. I already have.

44
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,206
But this is from Cuba.

45
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,446
Bolivar Belicoso.

46
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:12,870
This too.

47
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:17,377
Miami, not Cuba, Comrade.

48
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,930
I saw failed to capture Aidid has become a routine you.

49
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,800
We're not trying to catch Aidid. We are trying to catch you.

50
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,698
I?

51
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:35,169
But as important is that what I am?

52
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,130
I do not think so.

53
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:40,333
- You're just a businessman. - Trying to make a living.

54
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,273
Yes. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

55
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:49,808
How long have you been here?

56
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,945
Six weeks?

57
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,186
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.

58
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,890
You plug the reward poster.

59
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:05,663
25,000 dollars. As if this is? Duel weapons in KO Corral?

60
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,895
The true OK Corral.

61
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,570
You think the arrest will make him suddenly come to you?

62
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:16,972
Makes it more by?

63
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:21,540
You know where he sleeps.

64
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:25,643
You financed his life, much less his militia.

65
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,517
We will not leave Somalia before we find it.

66
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:33,356
And we'll find him.

67
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,057
Do not think because I'm a big no running water ...

68
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:38,123
... I'm dumb, General.

69
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:41,534
I know something about history.

70
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:46,542
See all of this? Just shape the future.

71
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:51,169
Future without much idea of ​​white boys Arkansas.

72
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:54,748
I do not know about that. I'm from Texas.

73
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,081
Tn. Garrison, you should not have come here.

74
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,589
This civil war.

75
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,389
This is our war.

76
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,390
Not your war.

77
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,895
300,000 dead and counting.

78
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,467
This is not a war, Tn. Atto. This annihilation.

79
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,566
I enjoy it now.

80
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,010
How does he think?

81
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,277
Polite, intelligent, ruthless.

82
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:31,115
Yes, he's a good catch.

83
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,953
It takes time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

84
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:36,890
I guess we do not have much time.

85
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,124
This is not Iraq. Which is much more complicated.

86
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:43,555
Boss, most of Washington disagree.

87
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:47,797
They asked daily situation report.

88
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:53,205
Tell them that the situation is vulnerable.

89
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,818
Mogadishu Airport Headquarters US Forces

90
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,383
Passenger and gentlemen, I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

91
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,212
I'll be your pilot today.

92
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:08,383
Appropriate federal rules, this Black Hawk helicopter smoke.

93
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,792
Mogadishu routinely fly program participants will get 100 free credits.

94
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:17,524
As usual, sickness bag in the back of the seat in front of you.

95
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,401
A good indication of the number one, Cliff. Take it to number two.

96
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,932
The sky was still bright.

97
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:41,419
61, is 64. Move to UHF secure.

98
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:42,817
I have some bad news.

99
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,723
"Limo" is a word, Durant. I do not want to hear it.

100
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,658
That's not a word, but condensation.

101
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,834
"Limo" is a commonly used word.

102
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:55,698
The keywords in Scrabble, my friend. Commonly used.

103
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,864
When not in the dictionary, it does not count!

104
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,034
Nothing should be in the dictionary!

105
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,271
There should be in the dictionary!

106
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,678
If we go back to the base, said it should be reduced.

107
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,381
You touch my limo, will kutampar ass, Nightstalker.

108
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,578
Yes, the promise remained a promise.

109
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:15,085
A nice beach down there.

110
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:16,847
How's the water?

111
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,228
Warm reassuring. And filled with sharks.

112
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,893
- Name. - Todd.

113
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,035
- Last name. - Blackburn.

114
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:34,537
First name, Todd.

115
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,677
- So, what is it? - How is it like?

116
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,108
Mogadishu. Battles.

117
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:43,116
- Registration number. - 72,163,427.

118
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,983
The first, called "Mog" only. Here nobody calls it Mogadishu.

119
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:51,458
Secondly, I do not know about the battles, so do not ask.

120
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,050
Why can not?

121
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:55,155
I told you, "Do not ask".

122
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,364
You seem almost 12 years, so I'll explain something.

123
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:04,998
I have a rare and mysterious skill that took me out of the mission.

124
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,443
Type.

125
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,943
- You can type? - No.

126
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,408
- Date of birth. - February 27, 1975.

127
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,254
I'm here to fight.

128
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,529
Let us enter.

129
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,976
Good, Comrade! Very smooth!

130
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,246
One shot penetrated the engine block.

131
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,614
Too bad. Though it was a nice jeep.

132
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,676
Stop shooting!

133
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:19,371
Check your weapons!

134
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:20,604
Sergeant Eversmann.

135
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,454
Pratu Blackburn.

136
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:27,778
Ya?

137
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,449
Reporting for duty.

138
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:34,460
Not me. Report it to Lt. Beales. He was around here.

139
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,756
Can I leave him with you?

140
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,790
Yes, please.

141
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,068
- Did you bring your gun. - Yes, Sir.

142
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,201
Do you want me to shoot? I am ready.

143
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,440
- When did you arrive? - Just now, Sergeant.

144
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:52,473
Hey, who's hungry?

145
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:18,337
What is this, Sergeant? Safari Delta financed by taxpayers again?

146
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,600
- Not if Jend. Garrison asked. - I asked.

147
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,002
Bon appetite, Captain.

148
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,115
- Lineup, Friend. - I know.

149
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:34,955
- This is not a rear end. - Yes I know.

150
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,487
Sergeant.

151
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,389
What is this?

152
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,489
Only a shooting exercise, sir. I do not want to leave.

153
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,727
I mean weapon.

154
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:48,429
Delta or not, the weapon was not yet secure.

155
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:51,903
You know that safety should always be installed at the base.

156
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,340
This is my safety, sir.

157
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,115
Leave it alone, sir. He had two days without food.

158
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:03,015
You guys are a bunch of cowboys Delta troops were undisciplined.

159
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:05,717
Let me tell you something, Sergeant.

160
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:09,687
When we've approached the target, you will need a Ranger-ku.

161
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,818
You must learn to be a team player.

162
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,086
Discussion over.

163
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:28,199
Speak up. You say this is your seat?

164
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,208
This shoe, son.

165
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,481
And this would fit in with enough force anusmu.

166
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,313
- It was a Jersey accent? - While I do this, given the opportunity.

167
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,386
Open sunglasses.

168
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,855
Delta wants to wear Oakley, that's their business.

169
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,155
I do not want to see you wear it again.

170
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,624
The weapon was not safe?

171
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,334
Is that your ways?

172
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:57,369
Hand on the chess pieces?

173
00:15:57,773 --> 00:16:00,173
I can beat you in three steps.

174
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:04,943
I'll keep an eye on that queen before defeating the other.

175
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,549
He just lay waiting.

176
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:12,443
Gosh.

177
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,682
Nice drawing. You're growing.

178
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,788
If I can give any advice or observations.

179
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:21,985
Please.

180
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,563
- It's a children's book, right? - Yes.

181
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:29,297
Supposedly it does not make children become afraid.

182
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:33,204
This part of the story where the knight would slay the dragon.

183
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:35,937
It's scary. Moreover, my daughter like this.

184
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:38,002
I thought you had it done last week.

185
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:39,909
Already completed?

186
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:44,976
We are in the line of 10 yards here.

187
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:46,644
You understand?

188
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,647
Can you count? One, two, ten.

189
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,320
Understand? Where players bertahanku?

190
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,325
Where players bertahanku?

191
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:58,959
I do not see you in church on Sunday.

192
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:01,102
There are other more important activities?

193
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,737
Not on Sunday. No longer.

194
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:06,104
I'll make you believe, understand?

195
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:22,756
Funny, huh?

196
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,322
A great impersonation. I got to know if it was me.

197
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,598
All right, go ahead.

198
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,136
- I want to talk, Specialist. - Sir.

199
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,299
You understand why we have a chain of command, right?

200
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,375
Yes, Sir.

201
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:45,937
Because if you memperolokku again, you'll clean the toilet with your tongue ...

202
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:49,041
... Until you can not distinguish where human feces and fries.

203
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,244
- Understand? - Yes, Sir.

204
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,251
OK.

205
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:00,152
Listen to this.

206
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,830
When a murder of a Somalian Somalia More ...

207
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,643
... Tribe tribe owes 100 camels on the dead man.

208
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:06,528
100 sleep.

209
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,999
Camel. I do not want to pay the camels.

210
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,439
There is definitely a lot of debt camels.

211
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,139
Is that true, Lieutenant?

212
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,368
Ask Sergeant Eversmann. She loves people of Somalia.

213
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,440
Sergeant Eversmann, you really like the Somalis?

214
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:23,613
Not that I like or do not like. I respect them.

215
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:27,950
You do not know if the sergeant is an idealist.

216
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:31,992
He really believes this mission. Do not you, Sergeant?

217
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:35,493
Look, they have no jobs ...

218
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:39,827
... Had no food, education, let alone the future.

219
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:43,497
I think there are two things we can do.

220
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:45,096
We can help ...

221
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:48,610
... Or silent watch this nation destroyed itself on CNN.

222
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:49,666
True, is not it?

223
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:52,981
Somehow you guys, but I was trained to fight.

224
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,241
You're trained to fight, Sergeant?

225
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:58,115
I guess I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.

226
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,654
As said Kurth, the sergeant is an idealist.

227
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,484
Wait. This is my favorite part.

228
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,898
Stay away from the cans!

229
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:15,501
You're dead handyman content of gasoline!

230
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,968
Stay away from the cans!

231
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:25,005
Possible.

232
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,072
He's having a seizure. Put something in his mouth.

233
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:33,087
It's okay, John.

234
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:42,434
At 5:45 the morning Sunday, October 3

235
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,301
He'll be fine. But not in this army.

236
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,967
He came out of the game. He suffers from epilepsy, had to go home.

237
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,107
Kau Kutugaskan memimpin regunya.

238
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,382
- Do you mind? - No sir.

239
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:38,545
It's a big responsibility.

240
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:41,181
Regumu will count on you to make the right decision.

241
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,315
Risk their lives.

242
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,621
OK.

243
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:49,264
- Ranger led the way, sir. - Along the way.

244
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:50,898
Good luck.

245
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:59,103
Hawlwadid road, Bakara Market BASIS Aidid MILITIA

246
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:39,210
Aidid's senior cabinet meetings may take place at 15:00 today.

247
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,779
I say "may" because we all know ...

248
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:46,250
... If the information we get on the road nothing definite.

249
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:49,288
This information was confirmed by three sources.

250
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,185
Two classes of officials may be present.

251
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:57,689
Omar Salad, Aidid's main political adviser ...

252
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:00,360
... And I Hassan Awale, the interior minister.

253
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:02,427
They are what we seek.

254
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:04,670
Today we depart.

255
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,731
The pattern of the same mission as sebeleumnya.

256
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:12,072
15:45, Striker Force Delta will infiltrate the target building ...

257
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,476
... And catch all the suspects in it.

258
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:18,585
Striker team Ranger: Ranger 4 under the command of Captain Steele ...

259
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:20,918
... Will be joined at 15:46 ...

260
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:24,423
... And keep the 4 corners around the target building.

261
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,291
Nobody in or out.

262
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,086
Troops of the pickup.

263
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:32,925
Lt. Col. jeep entourage. McKnight will get in at 15:47 ...

264
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:37,071
... Road Hawlwadig and waiting at Hotel Olympic.

265
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,739
Wait for the green light.

266
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,806
Once Delta gives the word ...

267
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:45,742
... McKnight team will toward the target and load the prisoners onto trucks.

268
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:48,715
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded ...

269
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:52,980
... The four Ranger teams will be drawn from the target building ...

270
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:54,587
... Climbed into the jeep ...

271
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,658
... And all the team will return to base 4.8 km away.

272
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,192
The mission will take place no more than 30 minutes.

273
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:08,133
I had requested armored vehicles and aircraft AC-130 Spectre ...

274
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:12,398
... But Washington wisely opposed this.

275
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,439
Too invite attention.

276
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:17,839
So Black Hawk and Little Bird will provide air support ...

277
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,275
... With small arms and rocket 2.75.

278
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:21,881
Colonel Harrell.

279
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:26,418
In the C-2 helicopter, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission ...

280
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:29,755
... And I will coordinate ground forces.

281
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:31,389
Colonel Matthews.

282
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,759
Irene's mission is to launch code.

283
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,219
Any question?

284
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:40,799
Building that, Sir?

285
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,931
Being ascertained now. Somewhere near the Bakara market.

286
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:50,568
I did not choose the time or place of their meetings.

287
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,543
I have no comment, sir.

288
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,249
Make no mistake, once arrived at the Bakara market ...

289
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,718
... You are in a very dangerous area.

290
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:01,620
Do not underestimate their capabilities.

291
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,452
We will skip friendly territory before it gets to the market ...

292
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:10,293
... So remember the rules crossfire: Do not shoot if not shot.

293
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,729
Now, let's get this implemented.

294
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:15,463
Good luck, gentlemen.

295
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:23,344
What is it, Danny? There's something you like?

296
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,740
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night ...

297
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:28,405
... As they chew khat leaves ...

298
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:32,748
... This part of town where Aidid could do counterattack.

299
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:36,022
- Why did not you like? - Life is not perfect.

300
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,956
You two, spinning 500 feet on it, it is not perfect.

301
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:43,858
Street below, there is no forgiveness.

302
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:21,332
Geez, Smith?

303
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:24,204
- How? - How what?

304
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:25,840
We leave?

305
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:30,975
- Why did you have to tell? - Because it's me.

306
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:36,011
Yes. 3:00. In the middle of the city.

307
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:37,742
- Bakara Market. - OK.

308
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:41,820
Listen, Smith, I want you to help out there.

309
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:43,218
Stay alert.

310
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:48,021
Good, Sergeant Eversmann.

311
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,596
Ev, this is not nothing.

312
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:52,530
It's nothing.

313
00:25:55,404 --> 00:26:00,740
Milling decisive. Do not be too smooth or rough.

314
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,538
This is an exact science, Friend.

315
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:07,246
I have people who believe in advertising.

316
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:09,576
"Try your best."

317
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:12,583
I make coffee during Desert Storm.

318
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:16,085
I make coffee for Panama, while everyone fought ...

319
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,122
... To be a Ranger.

320
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:23,662
Now "Grimesy, strong coffee made of sugar" or "Grimesy, you have coffee?"

321
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:30,027
- What is wrong with you? - Accidents ping-pong.

322
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:31,394
What?

323
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:33,739
Guess what.

324
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,141
Your request is granted. You're going out today.

325
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,973
Are you kidding.

326
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:41,682
You take my place as an assistant gunner M60.

327
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:45,046
Sergeant Eversmann told you to pack up and prepare yourself.

328
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:48,189
That's what you want, is not it?

329
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,688
Ya.

330
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:52,551
Of course.

331
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:56,424
Grimesy, remained with Waddell and give him ammo when needed.

332
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:02,393
I would not worry about that. Somalis errant shot.

333
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:06,540
Keep an eye on them just a stone's throw, and you'll be fine.

334
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:07,868
This might even be fun.

335
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:11,845
Delta duty. We only protect them.

336
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:14,814
Helicopters will protect us, and we'll be fine.

337
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:19,552
Listen, this is the first time I became a squad leader ...

338
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:23,189
... But this is not our first duty. This is serious.

339
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:26,794
We Ranger, not JROTC.

340
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:28,624
Our elite team.

341
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:31,458
We act like it out there.

342
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,296
Any question?

343
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,370
We'll be fine.

344
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:45,042
Grab your gear. We're off.

345
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,393
You will not need it, pal. We will not be there long.

346
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,778
You will not need it too.

347
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:21,214
We will be back before dark.

348
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,010
Better bring opium and beer.

349
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:25,483
What?

350
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:27,621
Ammunition, my friend. Bring ammunition.

351
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:38,530
Let me tell you something, Grimes. You've brought 22 kg of equipment.

352
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:39,825
Needless to plus 5 kg more.

353
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:44,405
Somehow you, but I do not plan on shot during a run.

354
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,997
Should I still use mine.

355
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,072
Grimes.

356
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,334
The most important.

357
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,743
Remember, when everyone is shooting, menembaklah same direction.

358
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:04,719
Look at that. He paste blood type in shoes.

359
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:08,420
- It brought bad luck. - No, it's clever.

360
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,527
All Delta do that.

361
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,324
It also brought bad luck, pal.

362
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,961
Let's go.

363
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,373
Fortunately, you're not left-handed, Adonis.

364
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,710
- If not, what do you do either. - You're funny, man.

365
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,149
- I do not accept the death certificate. - We had a deal.

366
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,947
I will return in an hour.

367
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,390
- Blackburn, you okay? - I can hardly wait.

368
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,356
Positively. I've been training for this lifetime.

369
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:48,760
Never shoot people before?

370
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:50,326
No sir.

371
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,168
I also.

372
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,592
14:29 pm Lunch

373
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,876
Do you think he can be relied upon?

374
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:32,471
We will see later. It's the first time he came out.

375
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:43,023
- Tell him to turn off his radio. - Good, Sir.

376
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,922
Tell him to turn off his radio.

377
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:47,985
Abdi, you must turn off your radio.

378
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:58,966
Hi. Here residence Stephanie and Randy, leave a message. Thank you.

379
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:03,743
Hey, darling, it's you. You are there?

380
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,304
Pick up if you're there.

381
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:11,152
I'm just calling to make sure everything is fine.

382
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:14,187
I'll call in a few hours.

383
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:17,157
We recommend that you do not sleep.

384
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,456
Your turn, Randy.

385
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,720
I miss you.

386
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,528
I love you, sweetheart.

387
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,299
Halo? Halo?

388
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:31,766
Thank you buddy.

389
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,042
It's ironic.

390
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,773
The beautiful beaches, the sun is beautiful.

391
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,414
Nearly so beautiful tourist spot.

392
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:44,950
Almost.

393
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,683
You think we should not be here.

394
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:56,086
Know what I think? It does not matter what I think.

395
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:01,801
Once that first bullet passing close to your head, politics and the like ...

396
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,097
... Had no meaning anymore.

397
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,900
I just wanted to do it right today.

398
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:11,376
Beware. Takeout entire regumu alive.

399
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:40,438
Is this the place or the car broke down again?

400
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:42,075
For me, answer.

401
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:45,045
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

402
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,578
For me, answer.

403
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,484
Can you hear me? Abdi.

404
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,252
Abdi, answer. Is this the place?

405
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,932
On the way to my right, above the cafe.

406
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,564
He says it's the building.

407
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:09,235
He sure?

408
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,669
Abdi, you need to be sure.

409
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,271
Are you sure?

410
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:19,277
In this way, two blocks from the direction of my left.

411
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,115
Too many militias.

412
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:25,016
When I got closer, they might shoot me.

413
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:28,515
Now he says the building was still two blocks ...

414
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:31,089
... But when she looked outside, she would be shot.

415
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:34,054
I'll personally shoot him.

416
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,789
Tell him to park in front of the building.

417
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:41,029
He will not be paid before he did it.

418
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:44,433
4.8 km from the target area. We never got out of the main road.

419
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:47,703
At the roundabout K-4, we are to the north and then east on National ...

420
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,973
... And we wait until the collection is completed prisoners here.

421
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:53,013
And with full power to Hawlwadig ...

422
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:56,608
... Load the prisoners, avoid attacks and bring them home.

423
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:59,513
Return in an hour. Understand?

424
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:03,020
There will be a shoot-out. Bakara market is the Regional Cowboy.

425
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:06,356
Be careful when shooting. There were citizens.

426
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:24,373
Reportedly they shoot his own head while playing Russian roulette.

427
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:40,357
Pak, the car stopped.

428
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,563
So this is the truth. This time he was sure.

429
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:49,663
- He sounded scared. - Good. It is always a good sign.

430
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:03,243
Thats it. It marks us.

431
00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:04,749
OK.

432
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:08,017
All QRF move.

433
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:11,551
All QRF move.

434
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:20,891
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.

435
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:33,005
Checking preparation. Barber 51 ready. Star 41 is ready.

436
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:34,475
Irene!

437
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:36,616
Received, Irene.

438
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:38,782
To hell with Irene!

439
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:53,497
Come on.

440
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,401
Good luck, my friend.

441
00:36:01,476 --> 00:36:02,909
Be careful.

442
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:05,404
There are no friends left.

443
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:08,646
What is wrong?

444
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:12,647
Nothing. He never did that.

445
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,122
Shit!

446
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,420
Let's go.

447
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,193
Sergeant Struecker. Let's go.

448
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:04,722
Two minutes.

449
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:07,326
Two minutes.

450
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,067
Why are they burning tires?

451
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:58,209
Signs of the militias if we come!

452
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:03,714
56, there seems to be some friends on the ground.

453
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:14,658
One minute.

454
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,258
One minute.

455
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,000
What for?

456
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:27,274
In the previous jump, I almost bite my tongue off.

457
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:00,171
Almost there.

458
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:05,638
Two legs, one leg ...

459
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:08,746
...to.

460
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:12,843
Little Bird reached the target.

461
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,489
These!

462
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,258
Quick! Quick!

463
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,973
Team One has landed. Two teams have been revealed.

464
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:16,480
Here McKnight. 64 troops approached the area specified.

465
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,787
Get down!

466
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,760
Keep your heads down!

467
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,695
Get down! They all hit the deck!

468
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,201
You, get down!

469
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:36,427
Get down!

470
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:37,528
Get down on the floor.

471
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:45,311
Come on, get down!

472
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:49,080
Grimesy! Have no fear!

473
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,148
Of course!

474
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:57,722
Ranger secured the area around. Four corners.

475
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:00,653
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

476
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,320
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

477
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:04,728
Reply shoot!

478
00:43:08,536 --> 00:43:11,630
64. The team here has been lowered, we're going to wait formations.

479
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:14,504
Here 62, the team has been delivered. Protection formations.

480
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:18,671
Super 62, give protection from sniper fire. Change.

481
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,247
Here the Super 65. The team has been lowered, we're going to wait formations.

482
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:31,550
Down, Blackburn! Download!

483
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:33,154
Down, Blackburn!

484
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:36,857
RPG!

485
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:38,531
Hold on!

486
00:43:41,502 --> 00:43:42,696
No!

487
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,205
C-2, there is a fall.

488
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:58,307
Super-61, you're an easy target.

489
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,916
Protection against snipers. Change.

490
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:04,420
Accepted. 61 out.

491
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:09,993
13, continue. You have to move towards the northern part of the road.

492
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,825
Right to the north. Change.

493
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:15,898

00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,345
- He was shot where? - Not a shot, but fell.

497
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,381
- What? - He fell.

498
00:44:30,618 --> 00:44:32,415
Why do not you shoot?

499
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,451
We have not fired!

500
00:44:34,688 --> 00:44:36,087
Do you know where?

501
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,849
Sibilation means close.

502
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,390
Now they're shooting at us!

503
00:44:50,137 --> 00:44:51,365

Matt, jeep distance away!

517
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:37,215
Bring a stretcher here. We take him to the target building.

518
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:38,816
What did he say?

519
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:42,853
Super 61, no one was hurt on the ground.

520
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:46,626
- Stretcher! - Get me a stretcher!

00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,139
Bring to a jeep! Now!

- Grimes, run! - Good.

535
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:37,443
C-2, here Super 61, began circling the target areas.

536
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:40,943

545
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:29,387
- What? - Five minutes.

546
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:31,090
Nothing for it!

547
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,037
What happened to him?

548
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,438
- Falling from the rope! - How can?

549
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,439
Put him into a jeep! Grimes, help him!

550
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:47,779
Come on! We're off!

551
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,109
Quickly, the road! Come on!

552

Put him!

553
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:55,211
Prepare to go!

554
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,780
Come on! All the way! Quick!

555
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:00,422
Stand up!

556

Grimes! Ayo!

557
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:05,558
Grimes!

Street!

564
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:55,142
Romeo 64, I sent three jeeps with a seriously wounded.

565
00:48:55,215 --> 00:48:57,274

I need more security in the jeep!

570
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:09,053
I will go. I'll take my team, make sure they come back safely.

571
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:10,153
Do it.

572
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,456

00:49:22,076 --> 00:49:23,338
Depart!

575
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:43,185
How is the condition? All right in there, Struecker?

576
00:49:43,263 --> 00:49:45,527
I do not want to talk about it now, Colonel!

577
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,964
I am busy.

578

00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:20,132
He hit a landslide!

Three people with RPG will emerge from the side. Now!

594
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:49,854
Hold on!

Super 61 shot. Wolcott helicopter was shot.

597
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:03,327

627
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:13,230
Search for survivors. Secure the area. The other group will follow.

Yeah, I heard. We must leave immediately.

655
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,934
Well, we have to leave now!

656
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:35,236
Will finish loading the prisoners and pick you up at the location of the fall!

657
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,536
Let's go!

00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,582
Quick!

661
00:57:02,035 --> 00:57:03,559
Clockwise 8!

662
00:57:17,551 --> 00:57:19,849
Grimes, stay away from the wall.

663
00:57:34,768 --> 00:57:37,100
Grimes. You okay?

664
00:57:37,437 --> 00:57:38,699
Ya!

665
00:57:40,774 --> 00:57:42,139
Ayo, Maddox.

666
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:44,941
- C-2, the convoy departed. - Be accepted.

667
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:47,739
Maddox, look at these fools!

668
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,541
Come on! Right, Maddox, right!

669
00:58:00,126 --> 00:58:02,617
Twombly, the convoy go!

670
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:04,793
Hei, Twombly!

671
00:58:05,632 --> 00:58:06,621
What?

672
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,324
- I think they forgot us. - What?

673
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:11,026
Never mind.

674
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:23,512
63 reported. Somali people come from all sides. They need help.

675
00:58:24,818 --> 00:58:28,584
The local militias moved toward the location falls Wolcott.

676
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,252
Repeat.

677
00:58:31,324 --> 00:58:33,622
Many people approaching.

678
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,523
How far Team Four of locations fall?

679
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,859
- Six blocks, sir. - They have to be quick.

680
00:59:35,622 --> 00:59:37,590
Get down!

681
00:59:38,692 --> 00:59:40,387
Scotty, are you okay?

682
00:59:42,429 --> 00:59:43,896
Do not come back!

683
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,665
Get down!

684
00:59:58,078 --> 00:59:59,375
Armed car!

685
00:59:59,713 --> 01:00:01,203
Shoot them!

686
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:10,218
Directions at six! Quick!

687
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:34,236
Come on!

688
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:41,013
Come on!

689
01:00:44,357 --> 01:00:45,824
Quick!

690
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:56,029
Yurek, go!

691
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:00,165
Come on!

692
01:02:27,627 --> 01:02:31,256
Team 64, turn left.

693
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:35,825
Romeo 64, I need to know before I arrived on the street!

694
01:02:36,035 --> 01:02:38,629
You should reduce speed. There was a delay.

695
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:43,434
From the time relayed from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

696
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,543
Can not reduce speed! We were attacked with great force!

697
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,408
Can not reduce speed!

698
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:52,349
Danny, I'll get the information from Orion surveillance above.

699
01:02:52,552 --> 01:02:55,282
So give me directions to the location of fall!

700
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:59,382
Danny, be patient. I no longer have the best views rutemu.

701
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:02,150
Work with incompetent, jerk!

702
01:03:02,328 --> 01:03:05,627
What troupe status Struecker jeep?

703
01:03:05,732 --> 01:03:08,667
Colonel Harrell, when arriving at the base, the group Struecker.

704
01:03:08,835 --> 01:03:11,497
The arrival time soon.

705
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:19,777
Open the gate!

706
01:03:41,534 --> 01:03:44,128
- Take him out! Come on! - Fast.

707
01:03:46,806 --> 01:03:48,239
Caution head.

708
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:49,673
Slowly.

709
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,348
- Blackburn, can you hear me? - Take him to the medical.

710
01:04:34,854 --> 01:04:38,381
Star 41 is already on location fell evacuate the wounded. Change.

711
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,550
Be accepted.

712
01:05:18,898 --> 01:05:20,263
I got you.

713
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,027
Slowly.

714
01:05:29,242 --> 01:05:31,107
Galentine, you okay?

715
01:05:31,244 --> 01:05:35,010
Galentine, Kurth, follow me! Fire protection, now.

716
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:36,708
Full protection!

717
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,528
How many are there?

718
01:05:52,598 --> 01:05:55,362
Two pilots were killed, two crew members were injured!

719
01:05:55,568 --> 01:05:59,060
- The wound was severe. Should be taken away. - Go.

720
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:35,101
26, here 25. Did you sprayed the car with the gun?

721
01:06:36,175 --> 01:06:37,767
26. Right here.

722
01:06:37,844 --> 01:06:41,940
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner. We will create a cover. Change.

723
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:44,843
26. D iterima here. We are moving there now.

724
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:46,348
Move!

725
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,488
Captain Steele, answer.

726
01:06:53,192 --> 01:06:55,057
Come in, 25. Here 64.

727
01:06:55,428 --> 01:07:00,058
There are two wounded and two pilots died in a helicopter!

728
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,025
We need to evacuate now!

729
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:07,838
Too dangerous to land the helicopter. Ensure safe first.

730
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:09,835
Where a group of the jeep?

731
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:12,878
I gave them know, 25, the convoy will be there.

732
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:16,073
They face a lot of resistance. 64 out.

733
01:07:28,161 --> 01:07:31,858
- Prepare the gun 50! - The location can be seen at the front.

734
01:07:32,064 --> 01:07:34,532
All I see is the roadblocks!

735
01:07:35,668 --> 01:07:38,102
I had to find another way.

736
01:08:03,396 --> 01:08:06,593
Give us a secure area in order to raise the injured.

737
01:08:26,752 --> 01:08:28,447
Fired weapon, Othic!

738
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,663
Tell my daughters that I'm fine.

739
01:08:53,012 --> 01:08:54,570
The tree!

740
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:27,302
The tree!

741
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:32,010
Joyce! Come on, help me lift it!

742
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:37,820
Take us away from this street! Where's the crash site? Repeat.

743
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:41,153
Continue 200 meters ahead.

744
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,486
Be accepted.

745
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,360
Come on!

746
01:09:45,898 --> 01:09:47,889
Come on, Dammit!

747
01:10:06,185 --> 01:10:08,710
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

748
01:10:12,925 --> 01:10:15,223
Jeep excursions will not be back, buddy.

749
01:10:15,861 --> 01:10:16,953
What?

750
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:20,264
What we have to catch up with them?

751
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:22,426
I thought they would pick us.

752
01:10:24,704 --> 01:10:27,229
- I think we should follow them. - Shit.

753
01:10:30,576 --> 01:10:32,134
Come to the location of the helicopter crashed.

754
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:33,200
OK.

755
01:10:33,379 --> 01:10:36,815
Do not fired it into my head. Now I have trouble hearing.

756
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:37,871
Let's go.

757
01:10:50,963 --> 01:10:52,590
Shit! Get down!

758
01:10:54,734 --> 01:10:58,226
- Did I say anything? Oath if ... - Shut up!

759
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:04,600
You are okay? Nelson.

760
01:11:05,244 --> 01:11:07,576
You okay?

761
01:11:08,114 --> 01:11:11,242
SAR helicopter medical escort.

762
01:11:23,062 --> 01:11:24,051
Come on!

763
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,024
Come on!

764
01:11:32,405 --> 01:11:35,863
Fuck. C-2, here 68. We shot.

765
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:39,375
Super 68, there is smoke coming from the top rotormu.

766
01:11:39,578 --> 01:11:41,705
- Kusarankan kau pergi sekarang -. Diterima.

767
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,613
Lowering the last.

768
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:50,450
Art, no militia with RPGs in the direction at 12. Can you see them?

769
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,884
I see. Turn 90 degrees to the left.

770
01:12:02,968 --> 01:12:04,230
68 leave the premises.

771
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,604
Super 68 leaves the premises. Change.

772
01:12:10,214 --> 01:12:17,213

773
01:12:18,517 --> 01:12:21,077
Wilkie, what is the situation there?

774
01:12:21,353 --> 01:12:23,184
Both pilots were killed.

775
01:12:24,023 --> 01:12:27,117
25, we can not take them, Matty.

776
01:12:27,293 --> 01:12:29,124
Brought only they could die.

777
01:12:29,195 --> 01:12:31,595
- Stabilized here? - Good.

778
01:12:31,964 --> 01:12:35,092
Stabilized in the helicopter. I repeat: stabilized in a helicopter. Change.

779
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:37,294
Understandably, Wilkie. We protect you. Change.

780
01:12:37,369 --> 01:12:40,861
Super 64, come closer and take Wolcott's position.

781
01:12:41,807 --> 01:12:44,139
Be accepted. 64 approached.

782
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,895
Super 64, you do nothing?

783
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,770
This is Super 64. We're not anything.

784
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,842
Are you sure? It seems that you hit pretty badly.

785
01:13:19,044 --> 01:13:21,035
The instrument panel is fine.

786
01:13:21,347 --> 01:13:25,181
We did nothing. Slight wobble in the steering rod, but we did nothing.

787
01:13:26,018 --> 01:13:30,387
Go back to the runway, 64. Check to be safe.

788
01:13:30,856 --> 01:13:31,845
Be accepted.

789
01:13:34,527 --> 01:13:38,691
Steering a lot of vibration. Checking the system again.

790
01:13:53,879 --> 01:13:56,370
We lost the tail rotor! The rotor was not there!

791
01:13:56,549 --> 01:13:58,244
64 will fall!

792
01:13:59,385 --> 01:14:00,909
64 will fall hard.

793
01:14:02,755 --> 01:14:04,484
64 will fall.

794
01:14:09,395 --> 01:14:11,260
We will fall.

795
01:14:16,235 --> 01:14:18,135
Struecker told the team to go there for protection.

796
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,502
They need to fall Durant location quickly.

797
01:14:20,573 --> 01:14:23,201
- A helicopter crashed again. - I want them taken away.

798
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:24,876
All.

799
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:32,343
Captain Steele, we have to go or we'll be stuck!

800
01:14:32,618 --> 01:14:34,609
We are moving as quickly as possible.

801
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,883
We do each task. Change.

802
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:49,023
- Fuck - Ruiz, do not wake up.

803
01:14:49,101 --> 01:14:50,261
A tree.

804
01:14:50,336 --> 01:14:54,102
Captain Steele, I'll tackle the threat in the window.

805
01:14:54,373 --> 01:14:56,637
We met in the building of gray. Soon, Captain.

806
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:57,232
Sergeant!

807
01:14:57,476 --> 01:14:58,636
All right, let's roads!

808
01:15:04,483 --> 01:15:05,780
Protect me!

809
01:15:11,624 --> 01:15:14,286
- Let's go! - Moving.

810
01:15:19,999 --> 01:15:20,522
Friend!

811
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,328
Friend will be late!

812
01:15:22,401 --> 01:15:24,767
Let's go! Quick!

813
01:15:25,004 --> 01:15:26,904
Come on!

814
01:15:27,406 --> 01:15:28,430
Come on!

815
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,810
Quick way! Come on!

816
01:15:38,217 --> 01:15:39,946
What are you doing outside of that?

817
01:15:40,019 --> 01:15:42,715
Doing my job! We have to go to the location of fall!

818
01:15:43,055 --> 01:15:45,853
We must go back to the streets and moving!

819
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,385
And you have to follow, sir!

820
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,721
Do not ever give me orders, Sergeant.

821
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,264
We can not fight well, understand?

822
01:15:53,866 --> 01:15:55,390
Too many wounded to be taken!

823
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:58,698
Then give me some shooters and I'll detour to the helicopter.

824
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,898
Grimes! You members of Team Four?

825
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:05,100
Yes, Sir!

826
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:08,747
Come with Delta! Rejoin Sergeant Eversmann.

827
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,579
The rest of you, secure this position!

828
01:16:11,784 --> 01:16:14,014
Treat the wounded, we'll wait for the convoy!

829
01:16:14,086 --> 01:16:16,611
Then we go to the location of the fall. Accepted!

830
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,187
Friends, come on!

831
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:52,113
C-2, I have two Delta snipers, Shughart and Gordon ...

832
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,887
... Ask yourself secure the location of the second fall. Change.

833
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:59,691
Super 62, the request is denied. I can not jeopardize other helicopters.

834
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:05,469
We did not see anything that moves in there, who knows what anyone is alive.

835
01:17:06,739 --> 01:17:09,469
Land team was prepared to go there.

836
01:17:09,641 --> 01:17:11,370
When the arrival? Change.

837
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:14,637
Not yet known, shortly.

838
01:17:14,813 --> 01:17:17,145
Do as much as possible from the air.

839
01:17:21,153 --> 01:17:22,916
Gathered!

840
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:26,286
64 Durant fell. We will be back to pick him up!

841
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:28,485
It was crazy. Do you have a life?

842
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,960
It does not matter, there's nothing left. You know that.

843
01:17:31,196 --> 01:17:33,391
We're wasting time.

844
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:36,591
Take the ammo and grenades extent, when you were five minutes!

845
01:17:37,836 --> 01:17:39,667
Sizemore, where are you going?

846
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,571
- Come with you. - Not with that cast.

847
01:17:43,442 --> 01:17:46,741
OK. Bring helmet yours.

848
01:17:49,014 --> 01:17:50,208
Speak up.

849
01:17:50,516 --> 01:17:51,881
I can not go back there.

850
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:56,512
Thomas, everyone feels the same to you.

851
01:17:56,722 --> 01:17:59,919
What are you doing right now, it makes a difference.

852
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,449
Decide.

853
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:31,348
It would help if the blood in the jeep was cleaned.

854
01:18:40,332 --> 01:18:42,266
Sergeant Struecker!

855
01:18:42,935 --> 01:18:46,268
Sergeant Struecker! Can I come, Sergeant?

856
01:18:46,705 --> 01:18:48,605
- You got ammo? - Yes, Sergeant!

857
01:18:48,774 --> 01:18:50,366
Follow!

858
01:19:08,393 --> 01:19:09,758
Wait!

859
01:19:10,696 --> 01:19:12,857
Come on, Thomas. Come up!

860
01:19:36,655 --> 01:19:37,815
Which direction?

861
01:19:42,828 --> 01:19:45,820
- To get there, I guess! - Do not be loud.

862
01:20:19,598 --> 01:20:20,929
Smart ass.

863
01:20:39,551 --> 01:20:40,950
Ranger?

864
01:20:41,453 --> 01:20:42,442
Who?

865
01:20:43,288 --> 01:20:46,849
I Yurek! You idiot!

866
01:20:47,025 --> 01:20:48,424
Shit!

867
01:20:48,627 --> 01:20:51,187
Friends, we almost killed you!

868
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,524
- Here! - You guys are here.

869
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:08,310
Sorry, Sergeant!

870
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,414
Friend, where have you been?

871
01:21:10,482 --> 01:21:12,347
Forget it. You brought NOD, right?

872
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:14,749
No, I did not take it and you know why?

873
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:18,187
Because you said: "You do not need it, we'll be back in half an hour."

874
01:21:18,257 --> 01:21:19,815
I did not say that to you.

875
01:21:19,891 --> 01:21:21,882
Nelson, take direction here.

876
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:23,853
We'll need night vision.

877
01:21:23,929 --> 01:21:26,329
What happened to you?

878
01:21:26,698 --> 01:21:29,462
He's deaf. My fault.

879
01:21:29,768 --> 01:21:32,032
- We should get out of here! - Go that way.

880
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:35,767
We're certainly not far from where the helicopter crashed. Which direction?

881
01:21:36,441 --> 01:21:38,170
I thought you knew.

882
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,343
Let's go.

883
01:21:45,917 --> 01:21:48,477
Nelson, Twombly? Please answer. Change.

884
01:21:49,554 --> 01:21:53,752
Nelson, Twombly, this Galentine. We need the convoy. Change.

885
01:21:54,793 --> 01:21:57,057
I can not contact them, Sgt.

886
01:21:57,296 --> 01:21:59,958
Sir, we go out of here and do evacuate!

887
01:22:01,433 --> 01:22:04,493
- Let's go. - Back to the defense!

888
01:22:04,736 --> 01:22:05,725
Come on!

889
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:11,237
Ground forces have occupied several buildings in Rehan Road ...

890
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:13,005
... But they are scattered.

891
01:22:13,078 --> 01:22:17,515
Team 4 Eversmann form of defense around the site fell Wolcott.

892
01:22:17,749 --> 01:22:20,081
DiTomasso was in the building opposite.

893
01:22:20,452 --> 01:22:24,388
40 Ranger Captain Steele and here are a few blocks away.

894
01:22:24,456 --> 01:22:25,980
They hurt pretty badly.

895
01:22:26,058 --> 01:22:30,927
He forms a collecting point victim, I guess they can not move.

896
01:22:31,163 --> 01:22:33,654
Sergeant Sanderson and a small Delta team ...

897
01:22:33,732 --> 01:22:37,600
... Moving from Steele's position to the location of the current fall.

898
01:22:48,613 --> 01:22:49,773
Shot switcher!

899
01:22:49,848 --> 01:22:52,908
When they stopped to refill cartridges, cover me!

900
01:22:53,118 --> 01:22:54,551
- Go! - Yes, Sir.

901
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,023
Again!

902
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:05,596
Reloading!

903
01:23:07,966 --> 01:23:09,456
Shoot straight!

904
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:11,931
Rifle jammed!

905
01:23:13,105 --> 01:23:14,572
Just me!

906
01:23:15,807 --> 01:23:17,570
Seriously!

907
01:23:30,155 --> 01:23:31,417
RPG!

908
01:23:46,371 --> 01:23:48,931
You okay? You are okay?

909
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:52,076
Yes. I could hear the bells tolling.

910
01:23:53,678 --> 01:23:55,908
Come on!

911
01:23:57,649 --> 01:23:58,638
Come on!

912
01:24:05,857 --> 01:24:08,826
There was a crowd approaching 6 or 7 blocks to the site crashed.

913
01:24:08,927 --> 01:24:11,225
Shughart and Gordon again request permission ...

914
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,732
... To secure until convoy arrives. Change.

915
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:17,993
General, the crowd now numbering in the hundreds.

916
01:24:18,236 --> 01:24:21,694
From his position, they can see more clearly than us.

917
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,707
They know what they are asking.

918
01:24:23,909 --> 01:24:25,376
Let me talk to them.

919
01:24:25,577 --> 01:24:26,669
Here Garrison.

920
01:24:26,745 --> 01:24:31,011
I want to make sure you understand what you are asking, say it clearly.

921
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:37,077
We asked down and form of defense until ground support arrives.

922
01:24:37,422 --> 01:24:41,586
You know I can not say how long, maybe longer.

923
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,019
- Be accepted. - You still want to go there?

924
01:24:45,363 --> 01:24:46,159
Yes, Sir.

925
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:51,795
- Colonel Harrell? - Yes, General?

926
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:52,928
Decide.

927
01:24:54,105 --> 01:24:55,595
Be accepted.

928
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:59,570
Goffena, turunkan mereka.

929
01:25:13,492 --> 01:25:15,255
What an asshole.

930
01:25:20,432 --> 01:25:21,421
RPG!

931
01:25:31,309 --> 01:25:32,901
Form of defense!

932
01:25:40,352 --> 01:25:42,343
No rocket in him, sir!

933
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:46,288
Othic, calm down! There explosives, blew!

934
01:25:47,592 --> 01:25:49,423
Fuck.

935
01:25:50,929 --> 01:25:54,092
All right, hold him! Slowly!

936
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,493
All right, put him there! Nice! Slowly!

937
01:25:58,703 --> 01:26:00,227
Get in the truck and driving.

938
01:26:00,305 --> 01:26:02,364
- But I'm shot, Colonel. - All people are shot.

939
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,533
We need his prisoner! Come on!

940
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:09,102
Reconnaissance sent via Hawlwadig, and then continue from there.

941
01:26:09,347 --> 01:26:13,613
McKnight, we need you to turn around and go back to Hawlwadig.

942
01:26:13,785 --> 01:26:16,049
Are you kidding! We just came from there!

943
01:26:16,121 --> 01:26:17,884
There is definitely the most secure!

944
01:26:17,956 --> 01:26:23,121
That's the information I received from JOC, you should turn around and go back.

945
01:26:24,396 --> 01:26:26,421
Be accepted.

946
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:29,765
I can not believe this! Turn around, Maddox.

947
01:26:29,834 --> 01:26:31,802
They tried to kill us!

948
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:33,462
We did it! Street!

949
01:26:33,538 --> 01:26:34,527
Fuck!

950
01:26:34,806 --> 01:26:37,138
Take us out of here, go!

951
01:26:44,849 --> 01:26:46,282
Continued to stomp the gas pedal!

952
01:26:46,351 --> 01:26:48,581
Continued to stomp the gas pedal!

953
01:27:00,098 --> 01:27:01,156
Fuck!

954
01:27:04,102 --> 01:27:05,091
Shit.

955
01:27:20,552 --> 01:27:23,316
C-2, Shughart and Gordon have gone down. Change.

956
01:27:23,521 --> 01:27:24,488
Be accepted.

957
01:27:50,582 --> 01:27:52,140
Friend!

958
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:55,547
Glad to see you!

959
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,588
Glad to see you too. How severe?

960
01:27:57,656 --> 01:28:00,557
My legs were broken and my back feels weird.

961
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,785
We have to get you out of here.

962
01:28:03,762 --> 01:28:05,593
Would I pull him out! Give protection!

963
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,989
Wait for me...

964
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:19,805
I'm going to drop.

965
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:22,980
C-2, we are in a location 64 falls, securing the area.

966
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,640
- Are you okay? -Yes.

967
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,149
Loaded weapon.

968
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:29,948
Anyone militia over here, you protect us from behind.

969
01:28:30,021 --> 01:28:32,683
- Where are the rescuers? - We have.

970
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:41,490
All right, stop, Maddox. Stop.

971
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,967
What an asshole.

972
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,936
Romeo 64, we are back to where we started.

973
01:28:47,172 --> 01:28:49,868
The bullet is low, many wounded including me ...

974
01:28:49,941 --> 01:28:51,909
... Vehicle was barely able to walk.

975
01:28:51,976 --> 01:28:54,911
All right, I need your estimation, Danny.

976
01:28:55,346 --> 01:28:57,473
Can you reach the site down?

977
01:28:58,216 --> 01:29:00,810
Colonel, I can not see anything.

978
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:05,787
Can not.

979
01:29:05,857 --> 01:29:08,917
With so many injuries, we only increase the level of danger.

980
01:29:08,993 --> 01:29:12,952
We had to return to base, did weaponry and then back out again.

981
01:29:13,031 --> 01:29:14,020
Good.

982
01:29:15,867 --> 01:29:19,132
C-2, bring them back. Take them away from there.

983
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,197
All right. Back to base.

984
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:24,372
We will return!

985
01:29:24,576 --> 01:29:26,567
Let's go. To the left.

986
01:29:35,163 --> 01:29:39,023
16:54 pm Afternoon

987
01:29:39,491 --> 01:29:42,790
Understandably. The convoy returned to base.

988
01:29:48,066 --> 01:29:50,159
- What is wrong? - They were sent home.

989
01:29:50,235 --> 01:29:51,896
Convoy returning to base.

990
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,131
Now it makes sense, does not it?

991
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:58,666
We must take away the wounded and get out of here before it's too late!

992
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:02,571
If Colonel McKnight returned to base, he had a good reason.

993
01:30:02,747 --> 01:30:04,214
It does not change anything.

994
01:30:04,415 --> 01:30:05,814
All right, listen.

995
01:30:05,884 --> 01:30:09,877
We will keep this region and also our defense.

996
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,920
Save hours of bullets. Shoot what you can shoot.

997
01:30:15,727 --> 01:30:17,524
The convoy will come.

998
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:19,919
We will return.

999
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:33,399
Reloading!

1000
01:30:41,886 --> 01:30:43,217
Reloading!

1001
01:30:43,755 --> 01:30:45,552
Randy, I need a pistol bullet!

1002
01:30:58,937 --> 01:30:59,926
Reloading!

1003
01:31:03,675 --> 01:31:05,074
Randy, the last bullet!

1004
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:09,604
Gordy!

1005
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:14,340
Shit!

1006
01:31:27,832 --> 01:31:30,027
Gordy had been killed, my friend. I'm going outside.

1007
01:31:30,602 --> 01:31:31,728
Good luck.

1008
01:31:53,157 --> 01:31:56,024
We need the 10th Mountain in there. All they got.

1009
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,222
Pakistan, Malaysia, I want their tanks and APCs.

1010
01:31:59,864 --> 01:32:01,263
They do not know we attack.

1011
01:32:01,332 --> 01:32:05,769
We have to disturb a beehive. We're fighting the entire city.

1012
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:10,935
I want all four-wheeled vehicles and armored. Take it all.

1013
01:32:11,142 --> 01:32:14,441
Once they are ready, we bring troops out of dangerous territory ...

1014
01:32:14,512 --> 01:32:17,106
... And back to the Pakistani Stadium, the safe zone.

1015
01:32:17,181 --> 01:32:19,706
- Go on. - Execute, Bos.

1016
01:34:34,352 --> 01:34:36,081
Mohamed Farrah Aidid ...

1017
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:40,851
... Give this man his prisoner alive!

1018
01:34:56,574 --> 01:34:59,202
Kneel!

1019
01:35:03,848 --> 01:35:07,784
Stay with me. There was a bullet in your leg.

1020
01:35:12,323 --> 01:35:15,258
Check tires are burning? All that black smoke?

1021
01:35:15,326 --> 01:35:18,853
Yes. I can see it, but I can not get there. Change.

1022
01:35:19,063 --> 01:35:22,123
100 meters from there. That location jatunya.

1023
01:35:22,366 --> 01:35:24,459
Can not. You do not understand.

1024
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:29,163
All the roads were blocked. You must swatch another route. Change.

1025
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:33,436
No. Only routes that circled the city.

1026
01:35:33,511 --> 01:35:34,603
Understandably.

1027
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:37,170
Kilo 64, here Kilo 11.

1028
01:35:37,415 --> 01:35:41,875
Ask permission to move to the location of the second fall walk. Change.

1029
01:35:42,787 --> 01:35:44,812
The green light, Kilo 11.

1030
01:35:44,889 --> 01:35:47,289
Stop the car. Let me down.

1031
01:36:13,988 --> 01:36:20,090
17:50 pm Afternoon

1032
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:35,965
Once I'm done with this, I'll make a margarita for you.

1033
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,907
Which as usual. With the blender, without salt.

1034
01:36:46,117 --> 01:36:49,314
Here Kilo 12. We have to change positions. Change.

1035
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,829
Eversmann, answer.

1036
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,161
Eversmann.

1037
01:37:08,606 --> 01:37:10,938
- Yes. Who is this? - Sanderson.

1038
01:37:11,008 --> 01:37:15,445
Do not shoot toward the east. We will be closer to you.

1039
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:18,040
Understandably.

1040
01:37:18,316 --> 01:37:20,750
DiTomasso and his men were in the southeast corner.

1041
01:37:20,818 --> 01:37:23,184
We need you on the northeast building.

1042
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:24,721
Good. We will do.

1043
01:37:25,323 --> 01:37:27,553
Caution militia. They're on the roof.

1044
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:30,116
They were praying, but no longer.

1045
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:35,395
Do not shoot to the east.

1046
01:37:57,488 --> 01:37:59,183
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1047
01:37:59,557 --> 01:38:01,957
No Nelson and Twombly with me.

1048
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:05,124
We saw the helicopter. Where are you?

1049
01:38:05,363 --> 01:38:08,491
We at sudur southwest. You from anywhere? You do not what?

1050
01:38:08,566 --> 01:38:09,430
Ya.

1051
01:38:11,002 --> 01:38:13,129
Do not shoot. We will be approaching.

1052
01:38:17,942 --> 01:38:19,000
We have to go.

1053
01:38:19,076 --> 01:38:22,011
Shawn, listen! Sergeant Yurek will run first.

1054
01:38:22,179 --> 01:38:26,138
As he crossed the street, he would turn around and protect you when you run.

1055
01:38:26,217 --> 01:38:30,347
Listen carefully. When I got there, you'll turn around and protect me.

1056
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,321
Do not run straight toward Eversmann.

1057
01:38:34,392 --> 01:38:37,225
You're going to stop and protect me.

1058
01:38:37,728 --> 01:38:39,889
It is important for you to understand.

1059
01:38:40,364 --> 01:38:41,729
All right, you ready?

1060
01:38:42,533 --> 01:38:43,898
Yes, I guess.

1061
01:38:49,473 --> 01:38:51,031
- Do not forget. - What?

1062
01:38:51,709 --> 01:38:52,937
Do not forget.

1063
01:39:06,457 --> 01:39:09,824
I saw them, Sgt. They came from the west gate.

1064
01:39:09,894 --> 01:39:11,020
I see them.

1065
01:39:13,964 --> 01:39:15,261
Let's move.

1066
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:19,431
Can you protect us, Sergeant?

1067
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:21,001
We protect you.

1068
01:39:28,245 --> 01:39:29,644
Nelson!

1069
01:39:36,454 --> 01:39:37,443
Shit!

1070
01:39:45,963 --> 01:39:46,952
Twombly!

1071
01:39:48,766 --> 01:39:49,892
Smith! Do not!

1072
01:39:50,034 --> 01:39:51,296
You okay?

1073
01:39:54,638 --> 01:39:56,003
Remove from me!

1074
01:39:56,774 --> 01:39:58,173
Let go!

1075
01:39:59,477 --> 01:40:01,104
Come on, friend. Come on.

1076
01:40:02,279 --> 01:40:05,214
Dock! Smith here need help!

1077
01:40:13,624 --> 01:40:14,921
My legs!

1078
01:40:14,992 --> 01:40:16,687
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

1079
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:25,793
Lift, one, two, three.

1080
01:40:27,138 --> 01:40:29,800
- You do not have anything. - I need some pressure on this wound.

1081
01:40:29,874 --> 01:40:30,932
My right thigh!

1082
01:40:31,008 --> 01:40:32,703
Pressure, yes.

1083
01:40:32,877 --> 01:40:35,209
- Zakarku still exist? - Zakarmu still there.

1084
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:36,371
I need more people here.

1085
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:39,041
Twombly! Nelson!

1086
01:40:42,188 --> 01:40:43,548
I need the chair.

1087
01:40:43,551 --> 01:40:45,751
- It really hurts! - Direct pressure on the wound.

1088
01:40:45,823 --> 01:40:47,313
It's okay.

1089
01:40:47,892 --> 01:40:50,258
- Let me see it! - Good.

1090
01:40:50,728 --> 01:40:52,992
Okay, so I checked.

1091
01:40:53,397 --> 01:40:54,796
Shit!

1092
01:40:54,999 --> 01:40:56,227
Shit!

1093
01:40:56,434 --> 01:40:58,834
- What's that? - It's okay.

1094
01:40:58,903 --> 01:41:01,064
Hold the wound. I need medical evacuation now.

1095
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:02,537
Galentine!

1096
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,729
It's okay

1097
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:05,605
Galentine! I connect with Captain Steele!

1098
01:41:06,544 --> 01:41:09,570
- Sergeant Ruiz, how are you? - Juliet 64, answer. Change.

1099
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:13,515
They will not come to help us.

1100
01:41:13,617 --> 01:41:16,677
You must survive, Sgt. You need to focus.

1101
01:41:16,754 --> 01:41:19,154
- Can you do it? - Juliet 64, answer. Change.

1102
01:41:19,223 --> 01:41:21,123
You can hold your gun?

1103
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:22,481
Yes, Sir.

1104
01:41:22,726 --> 01:41:26,719
Whoever passed that door, shot twice in the chest and once in the head.

1105
01:41:27,064 --> 01:41:30,500
- You understand? - I'm still ready to fight, sir.

1106
01:41:30,768 --> 01:41:33,703
Captain Steele, I need a medical evacuation here, now!

1107
01:41:33,904 --> 01:41:36,395
- Corporal Smith was shot! - Hold on, 25.

1108
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:38,173
I'm still ready to fight.

1109
01:41:38,242 --> 01:41:39,709
He was injured very badly.

1110
01:41:39,777 --> 01:41:43,508
25, we are also a lot of casualties. You have to endure. Change.

1111
01:41:43,581 --> 01:41:46,141
If I can help in a half hour, he is in danger!

1112
01:41:46,917 --> 01:41:49,010
C-2, here 64.

1113
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:53,452
Requesting medical evacuation for the wounded very badly at the location Regu 4. Change.

1114
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:56,391
Command, Team Four Star requested medical evacuation.

1115
01:41:56,594 --> 01:41:58,926
Can not. It's too risky.

1116
01:41:59,396 --> 01:42:04,265
Captain, we can not send a medical evacuation at this time. Hold on. Change.

1117
01:42:04,602 --> 01:42:08,436
25, here 64. The medical evacuation is not possible.

1118
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,405
JOC not want to lose the helicopter again. You must endure.

1119
01:42:18,983 --> 01:42:20,416
All right. I held.

1120
01:42:20,484 --> 01:42:22,918
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1121
01:42:24,788 --> 01:42:26,585
Not any.

1122
01:43:05,663 --> 01:43:08,530
I think this is mine!

1123
01:43:11,168 --> 01:43:14,296
Here Kilo 11. I was on location Durant fell.

1124
01:43:14,505 --> 01:43:15,904
Be accepted.

1125
01:43:37,494 --> 01:43:39,257
Location fall both already secured.

1126
01:43:39,496 --> 01:43:41,862
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs contact you, sir.

1127
01:43:42,366 --> 01:43:43,230
Cribbs?

1128
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,231
SAFE ZONE - PAKISTAN STADIUM 10th Mountain and UN Base

1129
01:43:45,235 --> 01:43:47,533
- They're still debating the route. - How long?

1130
01:43:47,671 --> 01:43:49,298
At least two hours.

1131
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:51,134
We have no time for it, Joe.

1132
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:55,804
Said Gen. Pakistan, because we did not tell about the attack ...

1133
01:43:56,013 --> 01:43:59,847
... Will take time to mobilize the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1134
01:43:59,917 --> 01:44:01,908
Tell this to the general ...

1135
01:44:02,119 --> 01:44:05,020
I understand, but it was my duty to remind him ...

1136
01:44:05,222 --> 01:44:09,283
... Troops besieged thousands of armed Somali militia.

1137
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:14,760
It's important to take them out of enemy territory to the safe zone.

1138
01:44:14,965 --> 01:44:16,489
I need help now.

1139
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:18,729
Good, Sir.

1140
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:25,069
Durant.

1141
01:44:25,776 --> 01:44:28,244
Michael Durant.

1142
01:44:28,979 --> 01:44:29,968
Ya.

1143
01:44:30,447 --> 01:44:32,847
You Ranger who kills my people?

1144
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:36,451
I'm not a Ranger. I am a pilot.

1145
01:44:40,391 --> 01:44:41,688
Correct.

1146
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:45,351
You Americans do not smoke anymore.

1147
01:44:48,565 --> 01:44:53,195
You live long, boring, uninteresting.

1148
01:44:55,072 --> 01:44:56,937
What do you want with me?

1149
01:44:57,775 --> 01:44:59,504
You bring the hostages.

1150
01:45:00,511 --> 01:45:02,103
We menyanderamu.

1151
01:45:02,312 --> 01:45:05,406
My government would never negotiate for me.

1152
01:45:05,949 --> 01:45:10,511
Then maybe we can both negotiate, is not it?

1153
01:45:11,989 --> 01:45:14,514
Inter soldiers.

1154
01:45:20,464 --> 01:45:22,261
I'm not authorized.

1155
01:45:25,536 --> 01:45:29,973
Certainly not. You have the power to kill, not to negotiate.

1156
01:45:30,441 --> 01:45:33,342
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1157
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:38,279
You really think if General Aidid captured ...

1158
01:45:38,482 --> 01:45:41,849
... We'll drop the weapon ...

1159
01:45:41,985 --> 01:45:44,977
... And apply the American democracy?

1160
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:47,219
That the killing will end?

1161
01:45:47,624 --> 01:45:51,685
We know this: Without victory can not be peace.

1162
01:45:52,463 --> 01:45:54,897
There will always be murder.

1163
01:45:55,365 --> 01:45:57,560
That's the rule in our world.

1164
01:46:10,414 --> 01:46:14,077
Mike Durant, we will not leave.

1165
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,656
Mike Durant, we will not leave.

1166
01:46:22,392 --> 01:46:25,259
You must take my place. Both hands.

1167
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:36,201
His femoral vein, but I could not see.

1168
01:46:36,406 --> 01:46:39,864
This means that the vein was drawn to the hip bone.

1169
01:46:40,077 --> 01:46:44,377
Must I found and pinned. The only way to stop the bleeding.

1170
01:46:44,581 --> 01:46:46,674
I do not have drip again.

1171
01:46:47,951 --> 01:46:50,852
So, I'll need you to stand beside me.

1172
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:52,615
Ya.

1173
01:46:53,557 --> 01:46:56,924
Listen, Jamie. I had to do something that will be painful.

1174
01:46:58,195 --> 01:47:01,892
Your pain will increase, but I must do to help you.

1175
01:47:02,099 --> 01:47:03,623
You understand?

1176
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,691
- Morphine. - Can not.

1177
01:47:05,903 --> 01:47:08,497
That would weaken the heartbeat. Sorry.

1178
01:47:08,572 --> 01:47:10,870
Twombly, why do not you catch hold of his hand?

1179
01:47:15,379 --> 01:47:18,314
Open wounds, keep the pressure on the foot.

1180
01:47:18,382 --> 01:47:20,577
Yurek, pegangkan kaki dan senternya.

1181
01:47:20,984 --> 01:47:22,110
In my count.

1182
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:24,177
It's okay, Jamie.

1183
01:47:26,456 --> 01:47:28,617
One. Two.

1184
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:30,618
Three.

1185
01:47:38,335 --> 01:47:40,769
Wait. I feel it.

1186
01:47:41,405 --> 01:47:42,770
I feel the pulse.

1187
01:47:44,341 --> 01:47:45,672
I found.

1188
01:47:45,742 --> 01:47:47,334
Yes, I've found.

1189
01:47:47,411 --> 01:47:49,003
- I found it. - You found him?

1190
01:47:49,446 --> 01:47:50,435
Clamp?

1191
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:54,215
Should kujepit.

1192
01:47:54,351 --> 01:47:55,545
- Hold. - Good.

1193
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:56,881
This, catch sinews.

1194
01:47:57,554 --> 01:47:59,283
- Sinews would tear. - It's getting.

1195
01:47:59,523 --> 01:48:01,388
- Doc, sinews would be interested! - Hold!

1196
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:02,686
Want to tear!

1197
01:48:03,026 --> 01:48:05,995
- Good. Hold the wound. - While I held.

1198
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:08,528
Minggirkan hands.

1199
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:20,971
What is wrong?

1200
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:41,086
Already repaired?

1201
01:48:44,701 --> 01:48:47,135
Yes. Already we're fixing.

1202
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:04,583
What are you doing?

1203
01:49:04,655 --> 01:49:09,058
Milling determine, Sgt. There should not be too coarse or too fine.

1204
01:49:09,259 --> 01:49:11,921
Grimesy, you look calm.

1205
01:49:28,245 --> 01:49:32,204
Sergeant, like coffee warm?

1206
01:49:34,017 --> 01:49:35,609
Kopi Gold Coast.

1207
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:38,754
Sit down. I wanted to check it away.

1208
01:49:39,356 --> 01:49:41,449
- It is okay. - Come on.

1209
01:49:47,898 --> 01:49:50,992
- Where did they find you? - Behind the counter.

1210
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:55,528
Very. You think I'm kidding?

1211
01:49:59,209 --> 01:50:01,006
- There is taxable? - We're okay!

1212
01:50:06,383 --> 01:50:07,543
You guys okay?

1213
01:50:07,617 --> 01:50:08,606
Ya!

1214
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:10,286
Everything is alright?

1215
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:11,378
Ya!

1216
01:50:25,402 --> 01:50:26,596
Look out!

1217
01:50:39,783 --> 01:50:41,717
Keep shooting. Faster!

1218
01:51:32,169 --> 01:51:34,160
DiTomasso shot! Evacuate him!

1219
01:52:07,637 --> 01:52:09,366
Ranger is here. Here Kilo 11.

1220
01:52:09,439 --> 01:52:12,670
Team Four. We are in the southeast corner of the site crashed. Who is this?

1221
01:52:12,742 --> 01:52:14,733
The Hoot. I came with 3 friends.

1222
01:52:14,811 --> 01:52:16,472
I need fire protection. Change.

1223
01:52:16,546 --> 01:52:19,481
Well, Kilo 11. Hold your fire! Team Delta will come.

1224
01:52:19,549 --> 01:52:21,574
Hold your fire!

1225
01:52:26,289 --> 01:52:30,919
Ground personnel have to mark target positions with infrared.

1226
01:52:31,595 --> 01:52:35,361
Tell helicopters patrolled all night.

1227
01:52:35,465 --> 01:52:37,729
If we do not hold this town ...

1228
01:52:38,435 --> 01:52:41,427
... There will be 100 coffins to be filled tomorrow morning.

1229
01:52:41,638 --> 01:52:42,866
Yes, Sir.

1230
01:52:43,073 --> 01:52:45,837
Colonel Harrell, ground personnel at the site of the first fall ...

1231
01:52:45,909 --> 01:52:50,403
... Will mark the target with infrared preparation for air strikes.

1232
01:52:51,107 --> 01:52:53,246
STADIUM PAKISTAN

1233
01:52:55,685 --> 01:52:56,913
McKnight.

1234
01:53:00,991 --> 01:53:04,586
Between the 10th Mountain and UN, we got enough personnel, right?

1235
01:53:05,929 --> 01:53:08,727
Danny, you guys do not have to go back there again.

1236
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:27,801
At 23:23 hours

1237
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:31,445
I can not die here.

1238
01:53:32,622 --> 01:53:36,718
You're not going to die.

1239
01:53:37,627 --> 01:53:39,094
Forgive me.

1240
01:53:39,296 --> 01:53:42,561
There is nothing to forgive.

1241
01:53:42,732 --> 01:53:45,895
You saved Twombly. You're doing a great job.

1242
01:53:47,103 --> 01:53:48,570
You do not have any, Twombs?

1243
01:53:49,139 --> 01:53:50,970
I'm all right, Jamie.

1244
01:53:52,309 --> 01:53:54,504
You act accordingly trained.

1245
01:53:55,445 --> 01:53:57,310
You should be proud of it.

1246
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:01,748
Be proud of it.

1247
01:54:02,586 --> 01:54:04,451
- Home? - Or.

1248
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:07,754
Help me.

1249
01:54:10,827 --> 01:54:15,764
Tell my parents that I fought bravely today.

1250
01:54:23,206 --> 01:54:25,071
That I fought very persistent.

1251
01:54:27,043 --> 01:54:29,511
You would like to own them.

1252
01:54:29,579 --> 01:54:30,910
Did you hear?

1253
01:54:32,716 --> 01:54:33,774
Understand?

1254
01:54:35,919 --> 01:54:39,047
- Jeep had arrived? - They're on the way, Jamie.

1255
01:54:39,556 --> 01:54:41,387
They will come.

1256
01:54:41,558 --> 01:54:43,822
You hang on a minute.

1257
01:54:43,893 --> 01:54:46,384
- Hold on a minute. - I can.

1258
01:54:46,563 --> 01:54:47,723
I can.

1259
01:54:49,099 --> 01:54:50,566
This is not nothing.

1260
01:54:51,801 --> 01:54:53,234
This is not nothing.

1261
01:54:54,271 --> 01:54:55,397
This is not nothing.

1262
01:54:55,472 --> 01:54:57,804
- It's not nothing. - It's nothing.

1263
01:54:58,742 --> 01:54:59,902
It's nothing.

1264
01:55:07,584 --> 01:55:08,573
Shit.

1265
01:55:09,586 --> 01:55:10,917
Hold the wound.

1266
01:55:37,947 --> 01:55:39,244
Doc.

1267
01:55:42,118 --> 01:55:43,142
Doc.

1268
01:56:00,236 --> 01:56:01,567
It's fine.

1269
01:56:28,198 --> 01:56:29,665
What are you doing?

1270
01:56:33,036 --> 01:56:34,765
We need ammunition.

1271
01:56:43,046 --> 01:56:44,843
You've tried everything you can.

1272
01:56:45,382 --> 01:56:47,612
They should have sent a medical evacuation.

1273
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:51,781
It should be at this time we were out there maintaining the helicopter crashed.

1274
01:56:52,055 --> 01:56:54,546
More people will get hurt.

1275
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:58,891
Maybe.

1276
01:56:59,396 --> 01:57:02,263
You're thinking. Do not.

1277
01:57:02,365 --> 01:57:05,391
Because you can not control who is shot or not, Sergeant.

1278
01:57:05,468 --> 01:57:08,232
Who falls from a helicopter or why.

1279
01:57:08,438 --> 01:57:11,066
It's not up to you. It's war.

1280
01:57:13,076 --> 01:57:15,067
Yes, but Smith still dead.

1281
01:57:16,746 --> 01:57:21,342
- It's all because Blackburn fell. - It should be possible not important.

1282
01:57:21,518 --> 01:57:25,284
You will have time think about it later. Trust me.

1283
01:57:29,058 --> 01:57:32,186
Sergeant, you're led anggotamu so far.

1284
01:57:33,029 --> 01:57:34,724
You did the right thing today.

1285
01:57:34,931 --> 01:57:38,389
You have to think about how to bring them out of here.

1286
01:57:44,808 --> 01:57:46,708
Should we help?

1287
01:57:55,452 --> 01:57:58,546
Place the four shooters in this corner!

1288
01:58:04,727 --> 01:58:06,319
RPG!

1289
01:58:10,233 --> 01:58:12,724
Here Barber 52 in position for shooting.

1290
01:58:12,802 --> 01:58:14,929
Oh, my God. Look at that.

1291
01:58:15,638 --> 01:58:18,664
Here 25! I can see you. You're right on top of me.

1292
01:58:18,842 --> 01:58:22,278
Eversmann, I can not distinguish people down there. Too much activity.

1293
01:58:22,345 --> 01:58:24,836
Target will I give the signal! Change.

1294
01:58:25,081 --> 01:58:26,241
Be accepted.

1295
01:58:38,027 --> 01:58:39,187
Do you see it?

1296
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:43,123
I can not see anything.

1297
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:46,967
- Will threw it to the roof. - You'll need help!

1298
01:58:47,036 --> 01:58:48,025
Protect me.

1299
01:58:49,239 --> 01:58:53,005
We will provide cover fire for him on the count of three!

1300
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:54,198
Ready?

1301
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:55,366
One.

1302
01:58:55,445 --> 01:58:56,537
Two.

1303
01:58:56,713 --> 01:58:58,442
Three. Come on!

1304
01:59:31,014 --> 01:59:34,450
I have seen the position and your target. We will be closer and shoot.

1305
01:59:59,042 --> 02:00:03,706
C-2, the bullets run out. Asked permission to return to base. Refill. Change.

1306
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:06,713
Be accepted. The second team on the way replace you.

1307
02:00:06,883 --> 02:00:09,078
Four minutes to get to your location again.

1308
02:00:17,226 --> 02:00:20,286
They're here. Prepare the injured to be moved.

1309
02:00:20,763 --> 02:00:23,197
Give covering fire!

1310
02:00:25,535 --> 02:00:27,628
I think I heard a noise outside!

1311
02:00:27,704 --> 02:00:30,434
- Raise. We go from here. - Yes, Sir.

1312
02:00:33,610 --> 02:00:38,343
25, here 64. Rescuers arrived and we'll be there in five minutes.

1313
02:00:38,548 --> 02:00:40,277
Prepare anggotamu for withdrawal.

1314
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:42,841
Good, Sir! Be accepted!

1315
02:00:43,586 --> 02:00:47,352
Five minutes! The convoy will arrive in five minutes!

1316
02:01:07,310 --> 02:01:09,574
I need ammo! Eversmann, bullets run out!

1317
02:01:09,746 --> 02:01:11,077
The bullet last!

1318
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:20,745
2:05 pm Early Days

1319
02:01:21,257 --> 02:01:23,418
Convoy has arrived!

1320
02:01:41,978 --> 02:01:45,505
Sergeant Eversmann. I heard you guys need a ride!

1321
02:01:45,748 --> 02:01:47,409
Yes, Sir!

1322
02:01:47,617 --> 02:01:50,211
Bring out the wound and begin to raise them!

1323
02:01:57,427 --> 02:01:59,554
Let me memapahmu.

1324
02:01:59,762 --> 02:02:02,492
It is okay. I'm going my own way.

1325
02:02:03,032 --> 02:02:06,092
Yes, I would. Let's go!

1326
02:02:15,278 --> 02:02:16,370
Quick!

1327
02:02:19,649 --> 02:02:22,982
We remove the bodies of the pilot and then we go to the stadium.

1328
02:02:23,653 --> 02:02:25,450
We started to run out of space here.

1329
02:02:25,521 --> 02:02:27,489
Force any room available.

1330
02:02:28,324 --> 02:02:33,318
Okay, 10th Mountain will protect us to get out of the danger zone.

1331
02:02:33,529 --> 02:02:35,019
10th Mountain? No.

1332
02:02:35,231 --> 02:02:38,325
Sir, with respect, my Ranger troops can give protection from the rear.

1333
02:02:38,501 --> 02:02:42,665
We will escort you out of the danger zone and more recent vehicle.

1334
02:02:43,673 --> 02:02:44,935
All right, let's go from here.

1335
02:02:45,007 --> 02:02:46,201
Let's go.

1336
02:02:46,409 --> 02:02:48,900
- You're holding it? - Yes, let's.

1337
02:02:50,847 --> 02:02:52,212
Come on!

1338
02:02:53,349 --> 02:02:56,341
These cars magnet for bullets. Let's go!

1339
02:02:56,419 --> 02:02:58,853
We go if there had been an order, soldier.

1340
02:03:01,724 --> 02:03:02,918
Be careful.

1341
02:03:03,526 --> 02:03:05,721
Slowly.

1342
02:03:09,132 --> 02:03:10,497
Slowly.

1343
02:03:21,010 --> 02:03:23,240
Colonel, there's nothing there?

1344
02:03:23,312 --> 02:03:26,509
They were cutting across the cockpit around the body.

1345
02:03:26,716 --> 02:03:30,379
Will take how long? I need a real estimate.

1346
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,685
They do not know!

1347
02:03:34,657 --> 02:03:35,885
Danny...

1348
02:03:37,393 --> 02:03:39,190
... Nothing is left out.

1349
02:03:39,896 --> 02:03:41,727
You understand, son?

1350
02:03:42,198 --> 02:03:43,665
Yes, General.

1351
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:45,960
Do what you must do.

1352
02:03:47,336 --> 02:03:48,598
Good.

1353
02:03:55,244 --> 02:03:57,474
- Come on. Take him. - Already.

1354
02:03:58,347 --> 02:04:01,510
Bring all your equipment. Remove injured.

1355
02:04:02,345 --> 02:04:07,077
At 5:45 the morning Monday, October 4th

1356
02:04:07,432 --> 02:04:08,522
Quick!

1357
02:04:09,192 --> 02:04:11,217
Move! Quick!

1358
02:04:21,304 --> 02:04:22,293
Fuck!

1359
02:04:25,141 --> 02:04:26,472
Beware explosives!

1360
02:04:26,676 --> 02:04:28,507
- Come on! Quick! - Fast!

1361
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:42,456
- Open the door, there are personnel here! - Not fit! Come on!

1362
02:04:42,525 --> 02:04:43,617
What is wrong?

1363
02:04:43,693 --> 02:04:46,685
- On top of the car? - I do not want to ride to the top!

1364
02:04:47,663 --> 02:04:49,062
Already full.

1365
02:04:50,499 --> 02:04:53,764
We ran. Straight ahead. Use the vehicle for protection.

1366
02:04:56,172 --> 02:04:58,231
Street! Come on!

1367
02:05:15,157 --> 02:05:17,682
Stop.

1368
02:05:19,695 --> 02:05:21,060
- Fast! - Come on! Quick!

1369
02:05:21,297 --> 02:05:22,662
Come on!

1370
02:06:17,253 --> 02:06:19,687
Get down!

1371
02:06:20,923 --> 02:06:22,185
Get down, Mom!

1372
02:06:24,694 --> 02:06:26,059
Ammunition runs out!

1373
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:29,421
Sanderson, ammunition runs out!

1374
02:06:34,437 --> 02:06:36,029
Do you do.

1375
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:39,130
- What are you doing? - Do you do.

1376
02:06:40,943 --> 02:06:42,308
Kurth, ayo!

1377
02:09:06,155 --> 02:09:07,645
Slowly.

1378
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:59,303
Shit.

1379
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:03,038
Three millimeters longer uric throat hit by bullets. Do not move.

1380
02:10:04,713 --> 02:10:06,738
Hurry.

1381
02:10:10,119 --> 02:10:14,112
Coffee stay a little, but I'll bring tea.

1382
02:10:18,394 --> 02:10:20,021
How are you, soldier?

1383
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:23,095
I can not feel anything.

1384
02:10:33,175 --> 02:10:34,767
Check your heart rate.

1385
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:09,509
Hey, Sergeant.

1386
02:11:14,083 --> 02:11:15,072
Captain.

1387
02:11:15,251 --> 02:11:18,243
Lorenzo. How are you?

1388
02:11:20,856 --> 02:11:25,691
Bullet translucent. Medical interpreter said, I will recover in a few days.

1389
02:11:25,861 --> 02:11:27,556
That's good news.

1390
02:11:28,163 --> 02:11:29,858
We will strike again?

1391
02:11:29,965 --> 02:11:32,695
Certainly. We must reorder strength.

1392
02:11:34,270 --> 02:11:36,204
Jangan pergi tanpaku.

1393
02:11:37,206 --> 02:11:40,698
Jangan pergi ke sana tanpaku.

1394
02:11:41,443 --> 02:11:43,343
I can still do my job.

1395
02:11:45,114 --> 02:11:47,742
You must rest.

1396
02:12:02,898 --> 02:12:04,297
You're going back?

1397
02:12:06,402 --> 02:12:08,233
There is still our colleagues there.

1398
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:12,197
Fuck.

1399
02:12:17,379 --> 02:12:18,676
When I got home ...

1400
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:21,172
... People ask me ...

1401
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:24,683
"Hey, Hoot, why did you do it?"

1402
02:12:25,254 --> 02:12:29,088
"You're sort of addicted to war?"

1403
02:12:29,892 --> 02:12:32,326
I will not say a word.

1404
02:12:32,661 --> 02:12:33,889
Why?

1405
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:36,361
They will never understand.

1406
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:40,398
They will not understand why we do this.

1407
02:12:41,904 --> 02:12:46,034
They will not understand this about the fellow next to us.

1408
02:12:47,876 --> 02:12:49,207
Only that.

1409
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:52,711
That is all.

1410
02:13:03,058 --> 02:13:07,427
Never thought about it. I should go alone.

1411
02:13:12,568 --> 02:13:15,560
We start the new week. It's Monday.

1412
02:13:28,417 --> 02:13:30,578
I was talking to Blackburn a few days ago ...

1413
02:13:30,652 --> 02:13:35,351
... And he asked, "What's changed? Why are we going home?"

1414
02:13:36,892 --> 02:13:39,224
And I answered, "Nothing."

1415
02:13:39,428 --> 02:13:43,364
But it's not true. I think everything changed.

1416
02:13:44,767 --> 02:13:46,257
I know I have changed.

1417
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:54,736
A friend of mine asked me before I came here.

1418
02:13:54,877 --> 02:13:57,141
It was when we were assigned.

1419
02:13:57,279 --> 02:13:58,769
She asked me.

1420
02:14:00,048 --> 02:14:02,778
"Why did you join the war of others?"

1421
02:14:03,485 --> 02:14:05,919
"You think you're a hero?"

1422
02:14:08,891 --> 02:14:11,291
At that time I did not know what to say ...

1423
02:14:14,229 --> 02:14:16,629
... But when he was asked again, I will answer no.

1424
02:14:19,201 --> 02:14:21,226
I'll answer at all.

1425
02:14:22,337 --> 02:14:24,362
Nobody wants to be a hero.

1426
02:14:29,711 --> 02:14:31,975
Sometimes just happens.

1427
02:14:35,951 --> 02:14:39,011
I'll talk to your mother's father when I returned home.

1428
02:15:18,585 --> 02:15:22,946
During the raid was 1,000 Somali militiamen and 19 US soldiers Autumn.

1429
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:26,295
My dear, you'll feel strong and good in life.

1430
02:15:27,336 --> 02:15:29,804
I love you very much as well as children.

1431
02:15:30,706 --> 02:15:34,198
Today and tomorrow, let each day grow and grow.

1432
02:15:35,410 --> 02:15:39,574
Keep smiling and do not give up even when things are very difficult.

1433
02:15:40,883 --> 02:15:43,317
So, in conclusion, my dear ...

1434
02:15:43,685 --> 02:15:47,519
... Tonight snooze children in the warmth.

1435
02:15:47,956 --> 02:15:52,552
Say I love them. Then they hug me ...

1436
02:15:52,761 --> 02:15:55,594
... And give them a kiss goodnight from their father.

1437
02:15:57,554 --> 02:16:02,203
Sergeant Gary Gordon and Randy Shugart is the First Warrior Which Accept ...

1438
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:05,371
... Medal of Honor posthumously Since the Vietnam War.

1439
02:16:05,629 --> 02:16:09,152
Michael Durant captured Freed After 11 Days.

1440
02:16:09,445 --> 02:16:11,343
Two Weeks Later, President Clinton ...

1441
02:16:11,568 --> 02:16:13,986
... Interesting Delta Force and Ranger From Somalia.

1442
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:19,669
Major General William F. Garrison Accepting full responsibility ...

1443
02:16:19,896 --> 02:16:21,874
.... Top Results raid.

1444
02:16:22,081 --> 02:16:24,976
2 August 1996, Mohamed Farrah Aidid in Mogadishu killed.

1445
02:16:25,296 --> 02:16:27,846
The day morning, Gen. Garrison pension.

1446
02:16:37,137 --> 02:18:04,402
