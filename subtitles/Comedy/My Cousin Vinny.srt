1
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,603
Here's some
for 37 cents.

2
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,608
Here's some for 32.

3
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,110
31.

4
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,611
I think that's it.

5
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,272
Don't they have
any generics?

6
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,610
This is their
generic.

7
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:21,617
I never heard
of that brand.

8
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:22,777
Get this one.

9
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,787
You're paying
for advertising.

10
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:26,447
Tuna.
We should get tuna.

11
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,115
Please,
no more tuna, OK?

12
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,783
It's got protein.
We need protein.

13
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,122
Beans have protein.

14
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:32,456
Beans make you fart.

15
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:33,962
We got a convertible.

16
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,299
I'm getting it
for myself.

17
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,969
One burrito and one large slush.

18
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,248
$21.67.

19
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,808
Can you fill this up?

20
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,814
21.67.

21
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:31,448
This next one's
a WSTT special request.

22
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,148
It goes out
to Ernestine..

23
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:34,155
Jesus.

24
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:36,158
I forgot
to pay for this.

25
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:38,160
You could have
gotten caught.

26
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:39,661
What if somebody saw?

27
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,664
The laws are medieval
down here.

28
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,324
Know what the minimum age

29
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,833
for execution is
in Alabama?

30
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:45,833
What, 16?

31
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:46,869
10!

32
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,636
A cop's behind us.

33
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,644
A cop?

34
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,737
There's no problem.

35
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:58,838
There might be.

36
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:01,042
There's no problem
until there's a problem.

37
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:02,483
Just relax, please.

38
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,923
Is he still there?

39
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:08,923
Yeah.

40
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,152
Goddamn it!

41
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,159
Calm down.

42
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,162
A cop's behind us,
that's all.

43
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,356
There's nothing's wrong.

44
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:16,364
Uh-oh.

45
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,365
What?

46
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:18,366
His lights are on.

47
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:19,766
Fuck!

48
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:21,394
Fuck. Goddamn it!

49
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:22,904
What do we do?

50
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,133
It's probably
nothing, OK?

51
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:25,640
It might be
a taillight.

52
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,939
We don't have
money for bail.

53
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:29,945
We don't need bail.
Nothing's happened.

54
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:31,173
We're getting pulled over!

55
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,772
You stole something!
You're finished.

56
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,180
Shut up, all right?

57
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,354
All right, here he comes.

58
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,395
Show me your hands!

59
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:48,897
Jesus.

60
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,557
Show me your hands!
Get 'em up!

61
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,465
Get 'em up! Up!

62
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:54,766
Now put your hands
on your head

63
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:57,966
and get out of the car!

64
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,474
Out of the car!

65
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:01,533
Go!

66
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,238
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure..

67
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:05,577
It's number 3 and 5

68
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:08,083
Ridiculous!
All this over a can of tuna.

69
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,413
Keep quiet!

70
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:19,153
All right, bye.

71
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:23,432
I think we may
get a confession.

72
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:29,597
I just heard that someone shot
Jimmy Willis.

73
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:30,605
He's dead.

74
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,232
Oh, my God!

75
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,800
Who would do
such a thing?

76
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:43,285
Hello, Bill.
I'm Sheriff Farley.

77
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:44,445
Hi.

78
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,195
Do you know why you're here?

79
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,890
Yeah. Sorry.
It was a stupid thing to do.

80
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:57,160
Have you been made
aware of your rights?

81
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:58,826
Yes.

82
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:00,836
You're willing
to waive that right?

83
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,269
Yes. I'll cooperate fully.

84
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,772
I'll sign a statement

85
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,330
or whatever
makes this easier.

86
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,740
Good.

87
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,073
Good!

88
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,205
That's.. That's good.

89
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:12,873
Stan had nothing
to do with it.

90
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,315
Did he help you plan it?

91
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,750
No.

92
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,254
I mean, it wasn't planned out.

93
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,882
It just, like, you know,
it just happened.

94
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,825
Did Stan try to stop you?

95
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:26,760
No.

96
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,525
I mean, he was..

97
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,971
Why? Is that a big deal?

98
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,199
Aidin' and abettin'.

99
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,969
Aiding and abetting?

100
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,202
That's a major thing?

101
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:41,471
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

102
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,339
An accessory?

103
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:47,447
Are you guys kidding?
An accessory?

104
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:50,452
I didn't help.
I didn't plan it.

105
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,454
You didn't try to stop it.

106
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,456
I didn't know
it was happening.

107
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,788
I found out later,
in the car.

108
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,794
Why didn't you
get out..

109
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,387
call the police then?

110
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,557
He's my friend.

111
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,227
Well..

112
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:10,239
your friend has put you
in a lot of trouble.

113
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:12,241
What's going
to happen to Bill?

114
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,573
Nothing..

115
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,236
unless he's convicted.

116
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,882
Of course, if he is..

117
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,919
we're going to run
enough electricity through him

118
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,011
to light up Birmingham.

119
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,521
We were friends at NYU.

120
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,024
We both applied and
got scholarships to UCLA.

121
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,356
We figured the weather
and the scenery

122
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,362
would be nicer
in the South.

123
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,761
What about
the tuna fish?

124
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:38,562
Then I forgot about the tuna,
and then we left.

125
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:41,570
Did he catch you
with the tuna fish?

126
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,071
Is that how it started?

127
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:44,265
He didn't say anything.

128
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,638
But he knew about it?

129
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:49,778
I don't know.

130
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:54,783
Let's talk about that
for a moment.

131
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,685
You paid for the groceries.

132
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,117
And then what?

133
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,990
We went out to the car,
and that's it.

134
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:07,120
When did you shoot him?

135
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,958
What?

136
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,796
When did you
shoot the clerk?

137
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,398
I shot the clerk?

138
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,961
Yes. When?

139
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,472
I shot the clerk?

140
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,565
Hey, Dean,
we need you out here.

141
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:23,079
I'm in the middle of
a damn confession here!

142
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,138
Whoa!

143
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:28,878
Wait a minute!

144
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,762
What's the matter?

145
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,094
You know what this
is all about?

146
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,599
Yeah. They're fucking with us.

147
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,101
You don't believe them?

148
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,761
They don't execute
for shoplifting.

149
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,271
You think we're being booked
for shoplifting?

150
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,932
You're being booked
for shoplifting.

151
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,602
I'm being booked for accessory
to shoplifting.

152
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,112
No. Stan,
I'm being booked for murder,

153
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,115
and you're being booked
for accessory to murder.

154
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:05,282
It's time to make
your phone calls.

155
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,515
Goddamn it!

156
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,022
Could you contact
your parents?

157
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,524
How? Call the Chilean consulate?

158
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:12,527
They'll send a guide
into the mountains looking for them?

159
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:15,291
We need an attorney,
a great attorney.

160
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,629
Do you know any
great attorneys?

161
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,793
No.

162
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,301
I'm calling my mother.

163
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,471
Hello, Ma?

164
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,508
We're in Wahzoo.

165
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,839
It's in Beechum County,
Alabama, Ma.

166
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,744
Not.. Not too good, Ma.

167
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:32,304
We, uh..

168
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,974
we've been arrested.

169
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,984
Ma? Ma, please.

170
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,146
First of all,
we didn't do it, all right?

171
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,483
Murder.

172
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,323
Ma.. Ma. Plea.. Ma.
Ma, it's a mistake.

173
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,829
We must look like
the guys who did it.

174
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,831
What we think
is happening is..

175
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,923
Shut up.

176
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,764
We think they're
setting us up.

177
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:54,997
You know how corrupt it is
down here.

178
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,504
They all know each other.

179
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,006
The Klan's here!
They're inbred!

180
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,872
They sleep
with their sisters.

181
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,036
Some of them do.

182
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:04,546
Ma, we got to get an attorney.

183
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:07,276
It's going to cost
a lot of money.

184
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,284
How much would
an attorney cost?

185
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,946
A decent one?
$50,000-$100,000.

186
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:13,785
50,000-100,000.

187
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:15,791
I know, Ma. I know!

188
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,452
Can we use any attorney?

189
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:19,790
I think so.

190
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:21,296
He thinks so.

191
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:23,965
Oh, he is?

192
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:25,797
Well, that's a great idea!

193
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,461
You think
he'll do it?

194
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:28,697
What?

195
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,069
We got an attorney.

196
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,232
My cousin Vinny!

197
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:38,571
Yeah

198
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:43,244
Did he sing this,
or did he sing that?

199
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,253
What is that?

200
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,482
I thought
she was that

201
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,388
But this
sinister collection

202
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,791
Use your own
reflection

203
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,557
The trial.. survival

204
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,758
Get into my telescope

205
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,765
Yeah

206
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,495
How's your business?

207
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,161
How's your business?

208
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,431
Yeah

209
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,268
How's your business?

210
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,898
Where is he from?

211
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:08,769
Get into my business

212
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,439
They tried
to tie you down

213
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:12,776
The ball and chain

214
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,077
The ball and chain

215
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,015
They tried
to make a move

216
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:18,020
So they changed
the game

217
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:20,454
Every time you're up

218
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,115
They try
to tear you down

219
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,456
I'm tellin'you
right now

220
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,630
The sinister
collection

221
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:38,799
Infection,
objection..

222
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:57,484
What?

223
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,686
Nothing.

224
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:01,389
You stick out like a sore thumb
around here.

225
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,022
Me? What about you?

226
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,033
I fit in better than you.

227
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:06,534
I'm wearing cowboy boots.

228
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,764
Oh, yeah. You blend.

229
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,400
I bet the Chinese food
here is terrible.

230
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,678
I don't see anything
out of whack.

231
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:20,307
The wheels went off-balance after
we hit that mud.

232
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,315
That's not it.

233
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,319
Put it on a rack
and take a look.

234
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,787
What's wrong?

235
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:27,788
What?

236
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,119
What's the problem?

237
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,422
Nothing.
The car was shimmying a little.

238
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:33,428
You got mud in your tires.

239
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:35,293
I got mud in my tires?

240
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,799
How do you get mud
into the tires?

241
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,698
That's a figure of speech.

242
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,703
The mud gets
inside the wheel,

243
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,398
throws the balance off.

244
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,668
You ever hear
of mud in the tires?

245
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,868
No.

246
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:48,877
She never heard of it.

247
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:50,879
She knows everything
about cars.

248
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,406
Now, see, down here,

249
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,918
everybody gets stuck
in the mud.

250
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:59,113
Yep, we're famous
for our mud.

251
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:00,986
You're famous
for your mud?

252
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,184
How's your Chinese food?

253
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,557
You keep asking
about Chinese food.

254
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:07,220
Can't you tell

255
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,288
they don't have Chinese restaurants
around here?

256
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,299
Everybody will know
you're a tourist.

257
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,704
What are you,
a fucking world traveler?

258
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,276
Stop the death penalty!

259
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:34,049
Our jail was condemned
this morning.

260
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,590
That's why we're
bringing you

261
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,149
to the State Corrections Facility.

262
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:39,455
Ha ha ha!

263
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,298
Unlock the gate.

264
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,077
Go on through.

265
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,296
You know what happens
in these places?

266
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,457
Yeah, I know what happens
in these places.

267
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,797
Sometimes
there's a big guy named Bubba

268
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,301
no one wants
to tangle with.

269
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,203
He'll protect you if you
become his sex slave.

270
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,798
There's only
two of us here.

271
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:02,667
What about those cots?

272
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,578
What if they put somebody
else in here?

273
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,910
Stan..

274
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,813
shut up.

275
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,909
OK.

276
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:20,894
Hey, hey, hey!

277
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:35,435
Here.

278
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:40,281
We got somebody for you.

279
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,787
You must be Stan.
How you doing?

280
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,789
Why'd they bring
you in here?

281
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:49,290
I just got in.

282
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:52,794
I asked for the new guys,
and they brought me here.

283
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:54,796
Hey, he's sleeping.
Cute little guy.

284
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,798
Maybe I'll just
start with you,

285
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,800
let him sleep a little bit.

286
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:01,234
I don't want to do this.

287
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,895
Hey, I don't blame you.

288
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,906
If I was in your situation,

289
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:06,908
I'd want to
get through this

290
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:09,740
as quickly and with as little pain
as possible,

291
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:15,250
so let's try our best to make it
a simple in-and-out procedure.

292
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:17,581
What's the matter?

293
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:18,881
Relax. Relax.

294
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,114
Relax.

295
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,056
Maybe we should spend
a couple of minutes together

296
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,593
to get acquainted
before we, uh..

297
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:28,653
you know,
before we get to it.

298
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,596
What's wrong with you?

299
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,157
I don't want to do this.

300
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:38,002
I understand,
but what are your alternatives?

301
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:39,005
My alternatives?

302
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:40,006
Yeah.

303
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,508
To what? To you?

304
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:43,807
I don't know..
suicide, death.

305
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:46,939
Look, it's either me or them.

306
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:49,450
You're getting fucked
one way or the other.

307
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:51,281
Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,116
Lighten up, OK?

309
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,588
Don't worry,
I'm going to help you.

310
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,989
Gee, thanks.

311
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,995
I think a modicum of gratitude
would not be out of line.

312
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:03,031
You think
I should be grateful?

313
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,328
Yeah. It's your ass, not mine.

314
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,165
I think you should
be grateful.

315
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,705
You should be down
on your fucking knees.

316
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:13,503
I didn't know
it was such an honor.

317
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,236
I'm doing a favor here.

318
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,336
You're getting me for nothing.

319
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:19,608
That's one hell of an ego.

320
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,616
What the fuck
is your problem?

321
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,811
I did not come down here

322
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:25,820
just to get jerked off.

323
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,082
No, no.

324
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:28,748
I'm not jerking you off.

325
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:30,257
I'm not doing anything.

326
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,260
That's it.
You're on your own.

327
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,592
I'm just taking care
of sleeping beauty.

328
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:36,096
Back off!

329
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,928
Vinny! Hey, Vinny!

330
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,932
Vinny?

331
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,935
Vinny Bag-of-Doughnuts!
How are you?

332
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,231
This is Vinny?

333
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:44,738
I don't know where to start.

334
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:48,106
Have you had any
murder cases before?

335
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,577
No. This will be my first.

336
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:51,578
Your first.

337
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:52,614
Yeah.

338
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:56,117
Well, what kind of
cases have you had?

339
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:58,153
Assault and battery,
armed robbery..

340
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,152
you know.

341
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:01,386
No.

342
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,724
Well, I expect he's done burglary,
grand theft auto,

343
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,194
drugs.. right, Vin?

344
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,664
No.

345
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,928
Nothing like that, either.

346
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:15,869
What kind of law
do you practice?

347
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,705
Well, up till now,
personal injury.

348
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:25,743
Well, you're a trial
attorney, right?

349
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,408
I mean, personal injury trials?

350
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:32,443
This will be my first foray
into the trial process.

351
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:35,285
I haven't had
to go to court yet..

352
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:38,087
knock on wood.

353
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,425
You haven't had to go to court yet.

354
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:43,431
How long have you
been practicing?

355
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:45,364
Almost six weeks.

356
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:52,269
Vin, you graduated from law school
six years ago.

357
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,400
What have you
been doing since?

358
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,467
Studying. For the bar.

359
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,873
Six years?

360
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,141
Mm-hmm.

361
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,705
That's a lot of studying.

362
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,716
Well..

363
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,619
to be honest with you,
I, uh..

364
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,122
I didn't pass
my first time out.

365
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,123
That's OK.

366
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,285
You passed the
second time, right?

367
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,454
I'm afraid not.

368
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,395
Three times a charm?

369
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,626
Not for me it isn't.

370
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,828
Nope. For me,
six times was a charm.

371
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,037
Six times.

372
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,025
Ahem.

373
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:58,168
A little informal, aren't we?

374
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
I was just, uh..

375
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,670
Not wearing
a coat or tie.

376
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:02,767
Oh! Sorry.

377
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,439
Well, approving an attorney

378
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,279
from out-of-state
is a pretty informal matter.

379
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,012
I just have
a few questions.

380
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,281
OK. Fire away, Judge.

381
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,289
Where'd you go
to law school?

382
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,154
Brooklyn Academy of Law.

383
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:19,660
Is that an accredited
law school?

384
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:21,093
Uh..

385
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,224
Oh.. yes.

386
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:29,327
How long have you
been practicing?

387
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:33,135
Oh, about, uh, six, uh..

388
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,143
almost 16 years.

389
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,803
Any murder cases?

390
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,314
Lots of them.
Quite a few, yes.

391
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,316
What was the outcome?

392
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,818
Uh, you know..
win some, lose some.

393
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:49,757
This is not the forum
to be cavalier.

394
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:53,158
Oh, of course.
Now, let me see..

395
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,389
most recently
I had a ax murder,

396
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,523
which I won
on the grounds

397
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,759
of temporary insanity.

398
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,199
Want to hear the facts?

399
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,201
No.

400
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,134
What else?

401
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:03,535
Let me see, what else?

402
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,197
Heard of Son of Sam?

403
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:08,835
The fellow who received
orders to kill from a dog?

404
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,538
That one.

405
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,443
You defended him?

406
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:13,947
Well, no, not exactly.

407
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,780
I defended the first guy
they arrested,

408
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,878
and, uh,
he was found innocent

409
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:24,016
and set free and, uh,
they caught the real guy.

410
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,289
Well..

411
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:31,127
we don't have any serial killers
in Beechum County,

412
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,691
but what we do have

413
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,260
is as sophisticated
a system of justice

414
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:38,272
as the rest
of the country.

415
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,500
Oh, I'm sure.

416
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:40,735
Being from New York,

417
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,299
you might have the impression

418
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:44,811
that law is practiced
with a certain degree

419
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,144
of informality down here.

420
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,148
It isn't.

421
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:49,241
Right.

422
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:52,185
I tell you this because
I want you to know

423
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,688
that when it comes
to procedure,

424
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:56,656
I'm not a patient man.

425
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:59,660
I advise you, sir,
when you come into my courtroom,

426
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:02,424
you are to know
the letter of the law.

427
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:04,465
I react harshly
when you don't.

428
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,000
You should.

429
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,093
New Yorkers
don't get special treatment.

430
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,432
They shouldn't.

431
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,098
You won't.

432
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:16,573
You'll be given
no leeway whatsoever.

433
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:23,677
I expect you to know this information
in my courtroom.

434
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:24,776
Oh, right.

435
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:27,117
You willing
to accept those terms?

436
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,520
Right. No problem.

437
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,793
Just this?

438
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:20,841
This is going to be great.

439
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,570
Vinny's first case.

440
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:25,511
So, what can I do to help?

441
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:31,614
Nothing?

442
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,086
No.

443
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:52,029
What the fuck is that?

444
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,189
Want to sit at the counter?

445
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:11,648
Hey.

446
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,160
How you doing?

447
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:15,958
Listen, uh, what's the story

448
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:20,161
with this incredibly,
remarkably loud whistle

449
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:22,430
at 5:30 in the morning?

450
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:23,937
It's the steam whistle.

451
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:24,937
Uh-huh.

452
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:26,439
Over at the sawmill.

453
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:29,705
Tell folks it's time to get up.

454
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,542
You can hear it for miles.

455
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,548
Y'all want something?

456
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,548
Yeah.

457
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:43,718
Breakfast?

458
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,783
You think?

459
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:48,159
Uh, good choice.

460
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,221
Two.

461
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,501
Excuse me.

462
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:01,974
You guys down here

463
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:03,806
hear about the ongoing
cholesterol problem

464
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:05,210
in the country?

465
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:18,491
What.. What's this over here?

466
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,323
You never heard of grits?

467
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:23,364
Sure. Sure, I heard of grits.

468
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:26,731
I just actually never
seen a grit before.

469
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,771
Honey, you going to try it?

470
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,829
You first.

471
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:37,168
What is a grit, anyways?

472
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:40,373
It's made out of corn.
Them hominy grits.

473
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:41,473
Hominy.

474
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:44,610
Hmm.

475
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:49,416
How do you cook it?

476
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:52,016
You simmer it in water
15-20 minutes,

477
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:55,085
put it on the plate,
and add butter.

478
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:57,631
So? You going to eat it or not?

479
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,645
Ha ha ha.

480
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,512
Is your attorney here?

481
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,411
I am the attorney.

482
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:49,746
Oh. Jim Trotter III,

483
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:51,581
District Attorney,
Beechum County.

484
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:55,180
Vincent La Guardia
Gambini I, Brooklyn.

485
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:58,584
Nice to see you.

486
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:32,655
Yeah.

487
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:37,296
Vin.

488
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:38,457
Hey.

489
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:46,641
All rise for his honor
Judge Chamberlain Haller.

490
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,835
The Court of Beechum County

491
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,775
is now in session.

492
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:53,808
Be seated.

493
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,513
First case.. The People
of the State of Alabama

494
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,887
vs. William Robert Gambini

495
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,017
and Stanley Marcus Rothenstein.

496
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:06,526
Stein. She called me Stine.

497
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:07,562
Just..

498
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,722
Counselor,
your clients are charged

499
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,231
with first-degree murder.

500
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:12,732
How do they plead?

501
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,268
Your Honor..

502
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,930
Don't talk to me
sitting in that chair.

503
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:21,565
But he told me to sit here.

504
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:23,076
When you're addressing
this court,

505
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:24,442
you will rise

506
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,949
and speak to me in a clear,
intelligible voice.

507
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,645
Ahem. Sorry.
My clients, uh..

508
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,347
What are you wearing?

509
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:35,755
Huh?

510
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:37,621
What are you wearing?

511
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,853
I'm, uh, wearing, uh..

512
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:40,986
clothes.

513
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,189
I don't get the question.

514
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:48,634
When you come into my court
looking like you do,

515
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,467
you not only insult me,

516
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,566
but you insult the integrity
of this court.

517
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,273
I apologize, sir,
but this is how I dress.

518
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:04,284
Next time you come
into my courtroom,

519
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:06,252
you will look lawyerly.

520
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:08,755
And I mean you comb your hair

521
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:10,917
and wear a suit and tie.

522
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,425
And that suit

523
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:14,928
better be made
out of some kind of cloth.

524
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:16,327
You understand me?

525
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,832
Uh, yes.
Uh, fine, Judge. Fine.

526
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,165
Good. You may continue.
How do your clients plead?

527
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,970
Uh, my clients
are caught completely by surprise.

528
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,636
They thought they were
getting arrested

529
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,236
for, uh, shoplifting
a can of tuna.

530
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:35,511
What are you telling me..
that they plead not guilty?

531
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,984
No. I'm just trying to explain.

532
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,681
I don't want to hear
explanations.

533
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,916
Alabama has its procedure,

534
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,425
and that procedure
at this point in time

535
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:46,926
is to have an arraignment.

536
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,986
Are we clear on this?

537
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:52,465
Yes, but there seems to be
a lot of confusion here.

538
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:53,466
Mr. Gambini.

539
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:55,503
See, my clients, uh..

540
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,003
Uh, Mr. Gambini.

541
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:00,006
All the way?

542
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:05,679
All I ask from you
is a very simple answer

543
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:08,341
to a very simple question.

544
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,850
There are only two ways
to answer it..

545
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,046
Guilty or not guilty.

546
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,453
Well, Your Honor,
my clients didn't do anything.

547
00:31:15,523 --> 00:31:18,390
Once again, the communication process
has broken down.

548
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:22,526
It appears to me

549
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:25,532
that you want to skip
the arraignment process,

550
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,034
go directly to trial,
skip that,

551
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,536
and get a dismissal.

552
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:37,677
Well, I'm not about to revamp
the entire judicial process

553
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,680
just because
you find yourself

554
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:42,683
in the unique position
of defending clients

555
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,185
who say they didn't do it.

556
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,983
Now, the next words
out of your mouth

557
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:50,149
will be "guilty"
or "not guilty."

558
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:52,216
I don't want
to hear commentary,

559
00:31:52,294 --> 00:31:54,455
argument, or opinion.

560
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:58,465
If I hear anything
other than "guilty" or "not guilty,"

561
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:01,434
you'll be in contempt.

562
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:05,371
I don't even want to hear you
clear your throat.

563
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,237
I hope I've been clear.

564
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:09,072
Now..

565
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,168
how..

566
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:12,941
do your clients..

567
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,072
plead?

568
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:15,081
I think..

569
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,583
I get.. the point.

570
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:17,709
No..

571
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:19,720
I don't think you do.

572
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:22,313
You're now
in contempt of court.

573
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:27,125
Would you like to go
for two counts of contempt?

574
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,127
Not guilty.

575
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,754
Thank you.

576
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:31,765
Bail will be set
at $200,000.

577
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:37,737
Preliminary hearing will be set
for 9:30 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

578
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:41,037
Bailiff, please take
Mr. Gambini into custody.

579
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,771
His bail will be set
at $200.

580
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,211
Come with me, please.

581
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:50,651
All rise as the judge leaves.

582
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,889
You have to bail me out.
You know that, right?

583
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:14,909
Let's go.

584
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:33,092
They're going to nuke

585
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:35,095
this guy Norton this weekend.

586
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:36,596
Looks like it.

587
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:38,598
You got one
huge responsibility

588
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,600
taking on this murder case.

589
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:43,603
You screw up,
and those boys get fried.

590
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:44,729
I know.

591
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:47,240
So you think you know
what you're doing?

592
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:49,742
Yeah, I think I know
what I'm doing.

593
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:51,244
'Cause you didn't
look like

594
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:54,247
you knew what you were doing today
in that courtroom.

595
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:55,748
Why is that?

596
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:58,251
Well, it's a lot
of procedure, that's all.

597
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,253
I'll learn it as I go.

598
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,686
Learn as you go?

599
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:02,814
Yeah, yeah.

600
00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:05,325
Didn't they teach that
in law school?

601
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:07,827
No, that's not
what they teach you.

602
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:09,830
They teach you contracts, precedents,
interpretations,

603
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:13,334
and then the firm that hires you,
they teach you procedures.

604
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:15,835
Or you could go
to court and watch.

605
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:18,338
So why don't you
go to court and watch?

606
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:19,839
Because between
your father's garage

607
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:21,341
and working nights,

608
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,343
when was I supposed to go?

609
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:24,844
I thought maybe this summer

610
00:34:24,913 --> 00:34:27,347
I would take off
a couple of months.

611
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:29,349
But it ain't
no big deal.

612
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,850
Are you sure?

613
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:33,183
Yes, I'm sure.

614
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:35,688
I don't know
how you can be so sure

615
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:38,191
when you don't know
what it is

616
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,692
you're supposed to know.

617
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,194
It's a procedure.

618
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:43,696
Like rebuilding a carburetor
has a procedure.

619
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:45,198
When you rebuild
a carburetor,

620
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:48,599
first you take the carburetor
off the manifold.

621
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,604
Supposing you skip
the first step,

622
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,106
and while you're replacing
one of the jets,

623
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,607
you accidentally drop
the jet.

624
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,109
It goes down the carburetor

625
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,610
and goes into the head.

626
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,611
You're fucked.

627
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,614
You just learned
the hard way

628
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,048
that you got to remove
the carburetor first, right?

629
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:05,052
That's what happened
to me today.

630
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,553
I learned the hard way.

631
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:09,055
Actually, it was a good
learning experience for me.

632
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:11,558
Is there any way
I could help out

633
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,059
in this procedure situation?

634
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:14,561
Yeah. Keep bailing me out.

635
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,062
There is one problem.

636
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:18,565
We can't afford
to keep bailing you out.

637
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:21,067
I already cashed in half
the traveler's checks.

638
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:23,570
I didn't want
to cash them in,

639
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:25,572
so I tried hustling
the money,

640
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,471
but I got stiffed.

641
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,875
What do you mean
you got stiffed?

642
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,894
'Cause I'll always
come back to you

643
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:56,061
if it ain't none
of your business, baby

644
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:57,263
You'd better
keep it..

645
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:24,957
Hey. Vincent La Guardia Gambini.

646
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,930
His name's J.T.

647
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,299
J.T.

648
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,305
I believe you and Lisa
played a game of pool

649
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:33,806
for $200, which she won.

650
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,503
I'm here to collect.

651
00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:39,513
How about if I just kick your ass?

652
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:41,014
Oh, a counteroffer.

653
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:43,516
That's what we lawyers..
I'm a lawyer..

654
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,883
we call that
a counteroffer.

655
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,979
This is a tough decision here.

656
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:50,490
Get my ass kicked
or collect $200.

657
00:36:50,558 --> 00:36:51,991
What do you think?

658
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,994
I could use
a good asskicking,

659
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:56,223
I'll be very honest
with you.

660
00:36:57,532 --> 00:36:59,022
Hmm.

661
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,627
Nah, I think I'll just
go with the 200.

662
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:08,467
Over my dead body.

663
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:11,034
You like to renegotiate
as you go along, huh?

664
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:14,980
OK, then, here's
my counteroffer.

665
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:17,415
Do I have to kill you?

666
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,477
What if I just kicked
the shit out of you?

667
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:22,716
In your dreams.

668
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,223
No, no. In reality,

669
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:27,193
if I was to kick
the shit out of you,

670
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:29,730
do I get the money?

671
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,692
If you kick
the shit out of me?

672
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:35,861
Yeah.

673
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:38,906
Yeah. Then you get the money.

674
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:42,099
What happened, rear ended?

675
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,871
No, I fell.

676
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:44,877
Oh.

677
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,379
OK.

678
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,245
Let's see if we agree
on the terms.

679
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:52,252
The choice now is
I get my ass kicked..

680
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,756
or option "B"..
I kick your ass

681
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:58,690
and collect the 200.

682
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,921
I'm going
with option "B"..

683
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:03,361
kicking your ass
and collecting $200.

684
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,862
Are we going to fight now?

685
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,925
Yeah. First, show me the money.

686
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:10,561
I have the money.

687
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,731
All right.
Show it to me.

688
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:14,968
I can get it.

689
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,476
You can get it?

690
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,739
All right. Get it.

691
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:21,111
Then we'll fight.

692
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,822
Did you fall in your place
or somebody else's?

693
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,822
My place.

694
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:30,823
Shit.

695
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:36,129
He blew the arraignment.

696
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:37,630
It's a simple procedure.

697
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:40,133
He just had to say "guilty"
or "not guilty."

698
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:42,169
We could have done that.

699
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,431
So? What are you saying?

700
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:46,939
What am I saying?

701
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:48,976
You saw what happened in there.

702
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:51,773
You want to stay
with him after that?

703
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:54,280
Shit, I don't want to fire him.
He's family.

704
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,750
And my mother,
the way her health is now..

705
00:38:57,819 --> 00:38:59,411
I appreciate that,

706
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,352
but should you die
for that?

707
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,755
Wouldn't your mother be more upset
if you died?

708
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:07,852
Given the chance,
he could do a good job.

709
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,760
No, you're wrong.

710
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:11,765
Knock it off. Let's go.

711
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:14,567
Stan, listen to me.

712
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:17,331
You have to see
the Gambinis in action.

713
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,839
These people love to argue.
They live to argue.

714
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:21,340
My parents argue, too.

715
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:23,343
That doesn't make them
good lawyers.

716
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:25,345
Stan, I've seen your parents argue.

717
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:27,040
Trust me, they're amateurs.

718
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:38,291
Is that a drip I hear?

719
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:41,827
Yeah.

720
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:45,631
Weren't you the last one
to use the bathroom?

721
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,632
So?

722
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:48,635
Well, did you use the faucet?

723
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:50,068
Yeah.

724
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:53,806
Then why didn't you
turn it off?

725
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,365
I did turn it off.

726
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:58,901
If you turned it off,
why am I listening to it?

727
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,778
Did it occur to you it could
be turned off

728
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,180
and still drip?

729
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:06,277
No. If you turned it off,
it wouldn't drip.

730
00:40:06,354 --> 00:40:07,787
Maybe it's broken.

731
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:09,789
Is that what you're saying?

732
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:12,291
Yeah, that's it.
It's broken.

733
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,794
You sure?

734
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,155
I'm positive.

735
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:21,929
Maybe you didn't
twist it hard enough.

736
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,528
I twisted it just right.

737
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:27,403
How could you be so sure?

738
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:30,410
If you will look
in the manual,

739
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:33,413
you will see
that this particular model faucet

740
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:37,417
requires a range
of 10 to 16 foot-pounds of torque.

741
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:40,943
I routinely twist
maximum allowable torqueage.

742
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,455
How could you be sure

743
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,458
you used 16 foot-pounds
of torque?

744
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,461
Because I used a Craftsman
model 10-19,

745
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,895
laboratory edition,
signature series

746
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,762
torque wrench,

747
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:56,270
the kind used by Cal Tech
high-energy physicists

748
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:57,770
and NASA engineers.

749
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,208
Well, in that case,
how could you be sure that's accurate?

750
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:03,709
Because a split second

751
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:06,212
before the torque wrench
was applied

752
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,713
to the faucet handle,

753
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:10,717
it had been calibrated
by top members

754
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:13,219
of the State
and Federal Department

755
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:14,948
of Weights
and Measures

756
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,513
to be dead-on balls
accurate.

757
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,490
Here's a certificate
of validation.

758
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:27,790
Dead-on balls accurate?

759
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:29,962
It's an industry term.

760
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:39,313
I guess the fucking thing
is broken.

761
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:56,619
We got to move.

762
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:02,699
Then I heard two loud bangs
like firecrackers.

763
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,671
I looked up and saw
two young men

764
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,674
run out
from the Sac-O-Suds

765
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:11,176
and jump into a green car

766
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:13,179
with a white
convertible top

767
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:15,681
and drive off
like the dickens.

768
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:18,183
Mrs. Riley,
are those two young men present

769
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:19,685
in the courtroom today?

770
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:21,186
Yes, sir. They are.

771
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:23,689
Could you point them out
for me, please, ma'am?

772
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:25,725
They're sitting
right there.

773
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,818
Uh-huh. Now, uh..

774
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:30,796
Mrs. Riley,

775
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:32,297
is this the car?

776
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:34,800
Yes, sir. It is.

777
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:36,301
Thank you, ma'am.

778
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,396
Oh. Let the record show
Mrs. Constance Riley

779
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,100
identified
the defendants' car.

780
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,505
I was making my breakfast.

781
00:42:47,014 --> 00:42:50,450
I saw them two boys
go into the store.

782
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:53,315
Then later, I heard a gunshot.

783
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:57,147
Looked out the window.

784
00:42:57,224 --> 00:42:59,215
They was running out,

785
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:01,659
got into the car,
and drove off.

786
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:03,025
Is this the car?

787
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,829
Yes.

788
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:08,890
It is.

789
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:11,529
Thank you, sir.

790
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:20,712
You saw those two boys

791
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,215
run out of the Sac-O-Suds

792
00:43:23,283 --> 00:43:25,217
and take off in this car?

793
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:26,718
Yeah, they peeled away.

794
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:29,278
Car was all over the road.

795
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,382
I asked him if he did it,

796
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:35,394
and he said,
"I shot the clerk."

797
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:39,091
I asked him again,
and again he said,

798
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,599
"I shot the clerk."

799
00:43:41,768 --> 00:43:44,635
Your Honor,
no further questions.

800
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,033
Mr. Gambini.

801
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:48,574
Yes?

802
00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:51,076
Do you have anything
to add?

803
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:52,373
Thing? What thing?

804
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:54,380
Not for me to say.

805
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:56,712
Uh, no, sir.

806
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:01,852
You can stand down.

807
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:04,356
Do you have
any other witnesses?

808
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:05,516
No.

809
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:07,958
The court finds
sufficient evidence exists

810
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:10,588
for this matter
to go to trial.

811
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:13,599
I'm setting this matter for trial

812
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,636
this Monday, February 2nd,
10 a.m.

813
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,671
Mr. Gambini?

814
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:24,303
Stand up.

815
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:34,347
Didn't I say the next time
you appear in my courtroom

816
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,854
that you dress appropriately?

817
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,653
You were serious about that?

818
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:44,959
Why didn't you ask them
any questions?

819
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:46,124
Questions?

820
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,794
Ask who questions?

821
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:51,303
You knew you could ask questions,
didn't you, Vin?

822
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:54,306
Maybe if you'd put up
some kind of a fight,

823
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:56,842
you could have gotten
the case thrown out.

824
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:00,175
Hey, Stan, you're
in Ala-fucking-bama.

825
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:02,181
You come from New York.

826
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:04,683
You killed
a good old boy.

827
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:06,184
There is no way

828
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:08,187
this is not going to trial.

829
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,484
What the fuck
is going on here, Vinny?

830
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,994
You fucking up
this case or what?

831
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:19,499
It's just procedure.
I'm bound to fuck up a little.

832
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:21,500
A little?
You're thrown in jail.. twice.

833
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:24,696
Hey. I know I was in jail.

834
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:27,706
I don't need you
to point it out to me.

835
00:45:27,774 --> 00:45:28,968
You're my fiancée.

836
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:32,239
You're supposed
to stand by your man,

837
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,745
Encourage me a little bit.

838
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,247
Is that what you want?

839
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,407
Yeah.

840
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,883
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were wonderful in there.

841
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:40,886
The way you handled that judge,

842
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:44,390
Oh, you're a smooth talker.
You are, you are.

843
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:46,824
All right, knock it off.

844
00:45:46,893 --> 00:45:49,327
You think I like
fucking up, is that it?

845
00:45:49,396 --> 00:45:52,331
You ragging on me
is not going to give me

846
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:53,661
any great spontaneous knowledge.

847
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:54,666
Yeah?

848
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:55,724
Shut it!

849
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:20,525
Fuck.

850
00:46:20,594 --> 00:46:22,892
You done reading?

851
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:24,692
Yeah.

852
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:29,201
You want to go to bed?

853
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:33,262
I don't know.
I don't feel good.

854
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,777
You shouldn't feel good.
You haven't slept much in three days.

855
00:46:37,844 --> 00:46:40,438
That's part of it.

856
00:46:41,848 --> 00:46:44,043
You know what it is?

857
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:54,686
I'm, uh, I'm really scared.

858
00:46:56,863 --> 00:46:58,262
You should be.

859
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:03,967
How the fuck
did I get into this shit?

860
00:47:04,037 --> 00:47:06,267
"Oh, sure, no problem.

861
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,773
I could win the case."

862
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:10,275
I already got myself
sent to jail twice.

863
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:12,278
I could win this thing, though.

864
00:47:12,346 --> 00:47:13,779
I know I could

865
00:47:13,847 --> 00:47:16,839
if I could keep my ass awake

866
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,851
and out of jail long enough.

867
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,853
You know what I think? Honestly?

868
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,355
I think that
once you're out there

869
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,857
and you're doing
your thing out there,

870
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,588
I think you're going
to be really great.

871
00:47:29,996 --> 00:47:31,623
Really great.

872
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:39,262
If..

873
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:41,569
you don't fuck up.

874
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,915
If this was a conspiracy,

875
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,748
they'd have to get
all those people to lie.

876
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,589
You think that's
what's happening?

877
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,594
I think we should meet
with the public defender,

878
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,425
see what he's like.

879
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,590
If he's honest..

880
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,600
then we should go with him.

881
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,766
All right.

882
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:54,279
That's death row in there.

883
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:56,574
It is?

884
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,244
The chair ain't working
like it used to.

885
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:01,344
The guy we fried last week..

886
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:04,356
took us three attempts,
and his head caught fire.

887
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:06,858
There's no money
to get it looked at.

888
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:09,122
It'd be cheaper
to get it fixed

889
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,131
than keep running up
them extra electric bills.

890
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,635
Hi, Stanley.

891
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,813
My name is John Gibbons,

892
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,644
and I'm, um, an attorney

893
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,650
in the public defender's office.

894
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,650
Hi.

895
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,651
Hey.

896
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:38,324
Now, evidence against you
is pretty strong,

897
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:39,983
so, um..

898
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,429
why don't you tell me
your side of the story?

899
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:56,669
Hey, Vin.

900
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,335
Hey. Billy.

901
00:49:58,411 --> 00:49:59,673
How are you?

902
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,179
How do you feel, OK?

903
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,180
Hanging in.

904
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,341
Where's Stan?

905
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,350
Uh, Stan, he's..
he's not coming.

906
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:06,510
Stan..

907
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,021
he's, um..

908
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,253
well, he wants to go
with the public defender.

909
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,591
Listen, Vin..

910
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:25,198
I'm going with
the public defender, too.

911
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,706
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.

912
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:31,210
I didn't know what little experience
you had with this.

913
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:34,037
What, are you scared?

914
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,049
Yeah, I'm scared.

915
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,551
Maybe I could have
handled the preliminary better.

916
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,881
I admit it.

917
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,548
But what's most important
is winning the case.

918
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,954
I could do it.

919
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:47,323
I really could.

920
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:49,328
Let me tell you how, OK?

921
00:50:49,396 --> 00:50:51,330
The D.A.'s got
to build a case.

922
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:53,798
Building a case is like
building a house..

923
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:56,802
each piece of evidence
is just another building block.

924
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,963
He wants to make
a brick bunker.

925
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,564
He wants to use serious,
solid-looking bricks,

926
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,040
like these. Right?

927
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:05,043
Right.

928
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:06,703
Let me show you something.

929
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:12,877
He's going to show you
the bricks.

930
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:15,387
He'll show you
they got straight sides.

931
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:18,390
He'll show you how they
got the right shape.

932
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:21,894
He'll show them to you
in a very special way,

933
00:51:21,962 --> 00:51:25,227
so they appear to have everything
a brick should have.

934
00:51:25,298 --> 00:51:27,562
There's one thing
he won't show you.

935
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:30,569
When you look at bricks
at the right angle,

936
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:31,899
they're this thin.

937
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:34,406
His whole case
is an illusion,

938
00:51:34,474 --> 00:51:35,736
a magic trick.

939
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:37,743
It has to be an illusion

940
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:39,608
'cause you're innocent.

941
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,545
Nobody..

942
00:51:42,616 --> 00:51:43,878
I mean nobody..

943
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:46,418
pulls the wool over the eyes
of a Gambini,

944
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:47,783
especially this one.

945
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,288
Give me the chance.

946
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,790
One chance.

947
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,792
Let me question
the first witness.

948
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,122
If after that point,

949
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,631
you don't think
I'm the best man for the job,

950
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,131
fire me then and there.

951
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,361
I'll leave quietly,
no grudges.

952
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:05,199
All I ask is
for that one chance.

953
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:08,706
I think you should
give it to me.

954
00:52:11,678 --> 00:52:14,112
He thinks you should
give it to him?

955
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,410
What was he before,
a fucking comedian?

956
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:18,747
If he doesn't ask
the right questions,

957
00:52:18,818 --> 00:52:20,080
your lawyer will, right?

958
00:52:20,153 --> 00:52:21,586
No. He'll fuck things up.

959
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:23,088
There's more
to cross-examination

960
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:24,589
than knowing what to say.

961
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:26,455
It's knowing
what not to say.

962
00:52:26,526 --> 00:52:28,960
Let's say he asks
all the possible questions

963
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:31,293
and the witness
has all the answers.

964
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:33,628
He ends up proving
the prosecution's case.

965
00:52:34,868 --> 00:52:37,302
How did he ever
talk you into it?

966
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:42,974
At my cousin Ruthie's wedding,

967
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:45,637
the groom's brother
was that guy Alakazam.

968
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:47,646
You know
who I'm talking about?

969
00:52:47,714 --> 00:52:49,204
The magician
with the ponytail?

970
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:50,271
Right.

971
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,783
Well, he did his act,

972
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:53,478
and every time
something disappeared,

973
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:54,850
Vinny jumped on him.

974
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,014
It was like,
"It's in his pocket!"

975
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,887
Or "He's palming it,"
you know?

976
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,755
"There's a mirror
under the table."

977
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:02,522
He was like,
"Wait a second."

978
00:53:02,595 --> 00:53:04,028
It's joined in the middle,

979
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,031
and there's a spring around it.

980
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,363
"It pops it open
inside the tube."

981
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,427
It was like Alakazam's
worst nightmare.

982
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:13,938
Vinny was just being Vinny.

983
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:17,272
He was just being
the quintessential Gambini.

984
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,114
There goes
the quintessential Norton.

985
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:36,619
Lookie here, J.T.

986
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,804
Hey-hey,
little Yankee boy.

987
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:47,897
Look here what I got.

988
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,805
What is it?

989
00:53:50,877 --> 00:53:52,777
$200.

990
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:55,542
Bring it here.
Let me see it.

991
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:04,548
Hmm.

992
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:09,186
How do I know
that's not a bunch of 1 s

993
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:11,196
with a 20
wrapped around it?

994
00:54:11,264 --> 00:54:12,629
It's 200 bucks.

995
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:15,293
Fan it out.
Show it to me.

996
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:21,631
Yeah. Right.

997
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:47,325
Does that freight train
come through

998
00:55:47,393 --> 00:55:48,985
at 5 a.m.
Every morning?

999
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:51,155
No, sir.
It's very unusual.

1000
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:53,824
OK.

1001
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:58,830
I made a lot of money
winning most of my cases.

1002
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:00,167
Thank you, Shirley.

1003
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,105
My clients
were guilty as hell.

1004
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:04,109
Finally, after getting
this one fella

1005
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:07,112
off some very serious
charges for the fourth time,

1006
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,114
my conscience got to me.

1007
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:11,446
Wouldn't I be better off
serving justice

1008
00:56:11,517 --> 00:56:13,451
by putting the guilty
in jail?

1009
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,615
That's what I'm doing,
and I'm a happier man for it.

1010
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,123
How about you?

1011
00:56:19,192 --> 00:56:21,456
Well, I got a bullshit
traffic ticket.

1012
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:22,789
I went to court.

1013
00:56:22,862 --> 00:56:25,330
I got the cop on the stand

1014
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:27,832
and argued until
he admitted he was wrong.

1015
00:56:27,901 --> 00:56:31,997
And, uh.. the judge,
this, uh, Judge Malloy,

1016
00:56:32,071 --> 00:56:35,006
all the while,
he's laughing and smiling,

1017
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:39,010
then afterwards he asks me
to go to lunch with him.

1018
00:56:39,078 --> 00:56:42,206
Then he says to me,
"you'd be a good litigator."

1019
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:44,716
I didn't know
what he was talking about.

1020
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:47,014
I don't know
what a litigator is.

1021
00:56:47,086 --> 00:56:49,680
I never thought
of becoming a lawyer,

1022
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:52,190
but this Judge Malloy,
who's from Brooklyn, too..

1023
00:56:52,258 --> 00:56:53,691
I mean, he did it,

1024
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,194
so all of a sudden,
it seemed possible.

1025
00:56:56,262 --> 00:56:58,355
So I went to law school.

1026
00:56:58,431 --> 00:57:01,298
Then from time to time,
he would come by,

1027
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:04,302
see how I was doing,
if I needed anything.

1028
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:07,798
He was a nice man.

1029
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:12,140
To go out of his way
like that for me, you know?

1030
00:57:12,211 --> 00:57:15,146
He wanted his son
to follow in his footsteps,

1031
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:17,478
but he became
a musician or something.

1032
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,983
I remember,
when I graduated,

1033
00:57:19,052 --> 00:57:20,713
he was so proud of me.

1034
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:23,221
That's quite a story.

1035
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:24,551
Yeah.

1036
00:57:24,624 --> 00:57:27,559
So, we got some case
ahead of us here.

1037
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:28,651
Oh, yeah.

1038
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:31,094
How do you feel about it?

1039
00:57:31,164 --> 00:57:32,597
Oh, well, I..

1040
00:57:32,665 --> 00:57:34,758
I'd like to have
the murder weapon.

1041
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:37,098
Other than that,
I feel pretty good.

1042
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:39,362
You do?

1043
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:40,770
Oh, yeah.

1044
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,637
Hmm.

1045
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,700
What are you doing
this afternoon?

1046
00:57:45,778 --> 00:57:47,439
You're going hunting?

1047
00:57:47,513 --> 00:57:48,605
That's right.

1048
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,114
Why are you
going hunting?

1049
00:57:50,183 --> 00:57:52,447
Shouldn't you be out
preparing for court?

1050
00:57:52,518 --> 00:57:53,951
I was thinking
last night..

1051
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,955
if only I knew
what he knows, you know?

1052
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:59,457
If he'd let me
look at his files.

1053
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:00,457
Oh, boy.

1054
00:58:00,526 --> 00:58:01,720
I don't get it.

1055
00:58:01,794 --> 00:58:03,227
What does
getting his files

1056
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:05,230
have anything
to do with hunting?

1057
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:07,732
You know, two guys out in the woods,

1058
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,233
guns, on the hunt.

1059
00:58:09,302 --> 00:58:11,270
It's a bonding thing,
you know?

1060
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:13,601
Show him I'm one of the boys.

1061
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:16,107
He won't let me
look at his files,

1062
00:58:16,175 --> 00:58:18,769
but maybe he'll relax enough
to drop his guard

1063
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:20,972
so I can finesse
information from him.

1064
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:22,981
What am I going to wear?

1065
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:24,983
What are you
going to hunt?

1066
00:58:25,051 --> 00:58:26,313
I don't know.

1067
00:58:26,386 --> 00:58:30,049
He's got a lot of stuffed heads
in his office.

1068
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:31,283
Heads?

1069
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:32,619
What kind of heads?

1070
00:58:32,692 --> 00:58:35,593
He's got a boar, a bear,
a couple of deer.

1071
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:37,959
Whoa. You're going to shoot a deer?

1072
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:40,966
I don't know. I suppose.

1073
00:58:41,034 --> 00:58:44,060
I'm a man's man.
I could go deer hunting.

1074
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:47,163
A sweet, innocent,
harmless, leaf-eating,

1075
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,174
doe-eyed little deer.

1076
00:58:49,242 --> 00:58:51,335
I'm not going
to go out there

1077
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:52,810
to wimp out, you know?

1078
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:55,074
The guy will lose
respect for me.

1079
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:57,013
Would you rather have that?

1080
00:59:03,356 --> 00:59:05,347
What about these pants I got on?

1081
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:07,620
You think they're OK?

1082
00:59:07,693 --> 00:59:09,285
Oh!

1083
00:59:11,864 --> 00:59:14,128
Imagine you're a deer.

1084
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,465
You're prancing along,
you get thirsty,

1085
00:59:17,537 --> 00:59:18,970
you spot a little brook,

1086
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,972
you put your little deer lips

1087
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,474
down to the cool,
clear water..

1088
00:59:23,543 --> 00:59:24,475
Bam!

1089
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:26,808
A fucking bullet
rips off your head!

1090
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:29,143
Your brains
are laying on the ground

1091
00:59:29,215 --> 00:59:30,477
in little bloody pieces!

1092
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:32,814
Would you give a fuck
what pants

1093
00:59:32,885 --> 00:59:36,116
the son of a bitch who shot you
was wearing?

1094
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:50,801
I'd sure like
to look at your files.

1095
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,132
You would?

1096
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:53,467
Sure.

1097
00:59:53,539 --> 00:59:55,803
You got a Xerox machine
over there?

1098
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,467
Uh, no.

1099
00:59:57,543 --> 00:59:59,135
Oh. That's OK.

1100
00:59:59,212 --> 01:00:01,305
I'll have
my secretary do it.

1101
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,143
Shirley,

1102
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:05,150
can you xerox
all the files

1103
01:00:05,218 --> 01:00:06,981
on the Gambini/Rothenstein case

1104
01:00:07,053 --> 01:00:08,645
for Mr. Gambini?

1105
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:10,484
Yeah.

1106
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:12,148
Thank you, sweetheart.

1107
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,425
What's all that?

1108
01:00:21,502 --> 01:00:24,062
Trotter's files,
all of them.

1109
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:25,729
You stole his files?

1110
01:00:25,806 --> 01:00:27,433
I didn't steal
his files.

1111
01:00:27,508 --> 01:00:28,770
Listen to this.

1112
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:30,605
I'm just ready
to finesse him.

1113
01:00:30,677 --> 01:00:31,939
I got him going.

1114
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:33,946
He offers to have
his secretary

1115
01:00:34,014 --> 01:00:36,107
copy everything
for me.

1116
01:00:37,184 --> 01:00:39,277
That's very impressive
finessing.

1117
01:00:39,353 --> 01:00:40,945
That's not all.

1118
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:43,285
He's letting us use
his hunting cabin

1119
01:00:43,357 --> 01:00:44,619
when he gets back.

1120
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:46,454
It's in the woods,
it's quiet.

1121
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:48,620
He sleeps
like a baby there.

1122
01:00:48,695 --> 01:00:50,959
Terrific.
You're a hell of a bonder.

1123
01:00:51,031 --> 01:00:52,498
What's this?

1124
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,659
You, uh,
reading this book?

1125
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:55,827
Yeah.

1126
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:58,667
Do me a favor, OK?
Don't read this book.

1127
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:00,172
OK?

1128
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,639
Thank you very much.

1129
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:02,970
All right.

1130
01:01:04,545 --> 01:01:07,309
Don't you know why Trotter
gave you his files?

1131
01:01:07,381 --> 01:01:09,815
I told you why
already.

1132
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:12,647
He has to.
By law, you're entitled.

1133
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:14,846
It's called disclosure,
you dickhead.

1134
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:16,890
He has to show you
everything,

1135
01:01:16,957 --> 01:01:18,948
otherwise it could be
a mistrial.

1136
01:01:19,026 --> 01:01:21,790
He has to give you
a list of witnesses.

1137
01:01:21,862 --> 01:01:23,386
You can talk to them.

1138
01:01:23,463 --> 01:01:25,829
He's not allowed
any surprises!

1139
01:01:27,701 --> 01:01:30,033
They didn't teach you that
in law school?

1140
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,041
Now let me
ask you this..

1141
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,171
how many different levels
of thickness

1142
01:01:41,248 --> 01:01:42,510
have you gone through?

1143
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:44,517
What did you
have for breakfast?

1144
01:01:44,585 --> 01:01:45,916
Well..

1145
01:01:45,986 --> 01:01:48,580
What's that brown.. stuff?

1146
01:01:50,324 --> 01:01:51,382
Huh?

1147
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:17,374
Yesterday you told me

1148
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:20,045
that freight train hardly ever
comes through here

1149
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,054
at 5 A.M. In the morning.

1150
01:02:22,122 --> 01:02:25,216
She's supposed to come through
at 10 after 4.

1151
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:29,361
Can you participate
in an endeavor

1152
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:30,862
in which
the ultimate decision

1153
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:33,024
might be death
by electrocution?

1154
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,862
Ma'am?

1155
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:39,372
I think it should be
up to the victims' families

1156
01:02:39,439 --> 01:02:40,872
rather than the courts.

1157
01:02:40,941 --> 01:02:42,033
Uh-huh.

1158
01:02:42,109 --> 01:02:44,202
Uh, the defendants
in this case

1159
01:02:44,277 --> 01:02:46,871
are charged with robbing
a convenience store,

1160
01:02:46,947 --> 01:02:49,711
and then in a most
cowardly fashion,

1161
01:02:49,783 --> 01:02:51,808
shooting the clerk
in the back.

1162
01:02:51,885 --> 01:02:54,149
Now, if sufficient
evidence is offered

1163
01:02:54,221 --> 01:02:55,813
to prove these facts,

1164
01:02:55,889 --> 01:02:57,322
you think you could,
uh..

1165
01:02:57,391 --> 01:02:58,483
Fry 'em.

1166
01:03:00,227 --> 01:03:01,819
She'll do.

1167
01:03:10,904 --> 01:03:12,496
Hmm.

1168
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,307
Mr. Gambini.

1169
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,974
Come in, come in.

1170
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:34,451
I just got a fax

1171
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:37,361
from the New York State Office
of Judicial Records.

1172
01:03:39,766 --> 01:03:42,200
They have no records

1173
01:03:42,269 --> 01:03:44,863
of any Vincent Gambini
ever trying any case

1174
01:03:44,938 --> 01:03:47,202
in the entire state
of New York.

1175
01:03:47,274 --> 01:03:48,866
Uh..

1176
01:03:48,942 --> 01:03:51,035
you're not going
to find any records

1177
01:03:51,111 --> 01:03:52,703
of Vincent
La Guardia Gambini

1178
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:54,610
practicing in any courts.

1179
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:56,114
I just told you that.

1180
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:57,445
You don't understand.

1181
01:03:57,517 --> 01:04:00,452
See, 20 years ago,
I became an actor.

1182
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,455
There was this prominent
stage actor in New York.

1183
01:04:03,523 --> 01:04:05,150
His name
was Vincent Gambini.

1184
01:04:05,225 --> 01:04:06,658
Maybe you heard of him.

1185
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:07,819
No.

1186
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:08,826
Doesn't matter.

1187
01:04:08,895 --> 01:04:10,988
Anyway, I had to change my name,

1188
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:12,326
which I did, legally.

1189
01:04:12,399 --> 01:04:13,832
So now I practice law

1190
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,629
under my legally changed
stage name.

1191
01:04:15,702 --> 01:04:17,067
What name is that?

1192
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:19,071
Jerry Gallo.

1193
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:23,742
Jerry Gallo.

1194
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:31,050
You can still
call me Gambini.

1195
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,050
I'm sorry.

1196
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,391
What name
did you tell him?

1197
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,892
Jerry Gallo.

1198
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,223
Jerry Gallo?

1199
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,557
The big attorney?

1200
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,722
Yeah.

1201
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,732
Think that was
a smart move?

1202
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,234
Yeah, well, the man's a seriously
accomplished lawyer.

1203
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,735
He checks up on him,

1204
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,068
his name will
show up all over.

1205
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,074
His name
was in the papers.

1206
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,404
Yeah. I saw that.

1207
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:57,909
You didn't read
the articles?

1208
01:04:57,978 --> 01:04:58,910
No.

1209
01:04:58,979 --> 01:04:59,911
Too bad.

1210
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:00,912
Why's that?

1211
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,243
'Cause he's dead.

1212
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,192
What's the matter
with you?

1213
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:24,862
I don't know.

1214
01:05:28,108 --> 01:05:30,542
You're acting like you're nervous
or something.

1215
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,202
Well, yeah, I am.

1216
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:34,474
Why? I'm the one
under the gun.

1217
01:05:34,548 --> 01:05:35,810
The trial starts tomorrow.

1218
01:05:35,882 --> 01:05:37,816
Want to know
why I'm nervous?

1219
01:05:37,884 --> 01:05:39,146
I'll tell you why.

1220
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:41,551
I'm in the dark
with this legal crap.

1221
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:43,145
I don't know
what's going on.

1222
01:05:43,223 --> 01:05:45,453
All's I know is
you're screwing up,

1223
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:46,753
and I can't help.

1224
01:05:46,827 --> 01:05:48,795
You lent me
your little camera.

1225
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,955
I'm watching you
go down in flames,

1226
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:52,464
you're bringing me
with you,

1227
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,625
and I can't do
anything about it.

1228
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:56,961
And?

1229
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:58,834
I hate to bring it up.

1230
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:01,169
I know you got
enough pressure already,

1231
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:03,175
but we agreed
to get married

1232
01:06:03,243 --> 01:06:05,177
when you won
your first case.

1233
01:06:05,245 --> 01:06:06,507
Meanwhile, 10 years later,

1234
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,980
my niece, my sister's daughter,
is getting married.

1235
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:11,279
My biological clock
is ticking like this,

1236
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:13,581
and the way
this case is going,

1237
01:06:13,653 --> 01:06:15,985
I ain't never
getting married!

1238
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,524
Lisa,
I don't need this.

1239
01:06:18,592 --> 01:06:22,028
I swear to God
I do not need this now.

1240
01:06:22,095 --> 01:06:23,357
I got a judge

1241
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:26,024
that's just aching
to throw me in jail,

1242
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:29,694
an idiot who wants
to fight me for $200,

1243
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:30,827
slaughtered pigs,

1244
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,338
giant, loud whistles.

1245
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,340
I ain't slept
in five days.

1246
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,002
I got no money,
a dress code problem,

1247
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:39,511
and a little murder case,

1248
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:43,845
which in the balance holds
the lives of two innocent kids,

1249
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,782
not to mention your..

1250
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,353
biological clock.

1251
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,855
My career, your life,
our marriage!

1252
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,186
And let me see!

1253
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:54,193
What else
could we pile on?

1254
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:55,694
Is there any more shit

1255
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,697
we could pile on to the outcome
of this case?

1256
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,528
Is it possible?

1257
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:07,373
Maybe it was a bad time
to bring it up.

1258
01:07:25,425 --> 01:07:28,019
What the fuck is that?

1259
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:58,089
This is very romantic.

1260
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,756
Out here
in this field..

1261
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,592
under the stars..

1262
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,757
quiet..

1263
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,768
no one around for miles.

1264
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:13,931
It's very romantic.

1265
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:19,805
I don't see no stars.

1266
01:08:35,729 --> 01:08:37,321
Oh. Oh.

1267
01:08:37,397 --> 01:08:40,161
Oh. Honey,
move way back. Way..

1268
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:43,327
I got to get up.

1269
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:46,830
Let me..

1270
01:08:49,409 --> 01:08:51,070
This fucking jacket!

1271
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:53,407
Hang on.

1272
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:10,588
Fuck.

1273
01:09:59,646 --> 01:10:01,511
Ho.

1274
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:02,673
You OK?

1275
01:10:02,749 --> 01:10:05,013
What was in that pink
plastic thing?

1276
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:06,382
It's your suit.

1277
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:09,581
What is my suit
doing in the trunk?

1278
01:10:09,656 --> 01:10:10,918
I had it cleaned.

1279
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:12,924
I thought
it would be nice,

1280
01:10:12,992 --> 01:10:15,722
go in there
with a nice clean suit.

1281
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:23,735
I have 30 fucking minutes

1282
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,737
to shower,
get a new suit,

1283
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,739
and get to the fucking
courthouse.

1284
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,900
You shower.
I'll get you a suit.

1285
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:31,739
Hey-hey,
little Yankee wuss!

1286
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:34,780
Lookie here. Ha ha ha!
I got your $200.

1287
01:10:34,848 --> 01:10:37,942
You going to kick
the shit out of me now?

1288
01:11:29,335 --> 01:11:30,734
Here he comes.

1289
01:11:47,487 --> 01:11:49,318
Mr. Gambini,

1290
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:51,687
are you mocking me
with that outfit?

1291
01:11:52,926 --> 01:11:55,486
Mocking you? No.
I'm not mocking you, Judge.

1292
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:58,122
Then explain that.. outfit.

1293
01:12:00,867 --> 01:12:03,802
I bought a suit.
You've seen it.

1294
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:05,701
Now it's covered in mud.

1295
01:12:05,772 --> 01:12:08,104
This town doesn't have
a one-hour cleaners,

1296
01:12:08,174 --> 01:12:10,438
so I had to buy
a new suit.

1297
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:13,809
The only store
you could buy a suit in

1298
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,142
has got the flu.

1299
01:12:15,215 --> 01:12:17,581
Get that?
The whole store got the flu.

1300
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:20,710
I had to get this
in a secondhand store.

1301
01:12:20,787 --> 01:12:24,553
So it's either
wear the leather jacket,

1302
01:12:24,624 --> 01:12:26,387
which I know you hate,

1303
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:28,154
or this.

1304
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:33,165
So I wore this..
ridiculous thing

1305
01:12:33,233 --> 01:12:34,666
for you.

1306
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,871
Are you on drugs?

1307
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,408
Drugs? No.
I don't take drugs.

1308
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:45,034
I don't like
your attitude.

1309
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,079
What else is new?

1310
01:12:47,146 --> 01:12:49,580
I'm holding you
in contempt of court.

1311
01:12:49,649 --> 01:12:51,207
Oh, there's
a fucking surprise.

1312
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:52,581
What did you say?

1313
01:12:52,652 --> 01:12:54,085
What?

1314
01:12:54,153 --> 01:12:55,745
What did you just say?

1315
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,083
What did I say?
What?

1316
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,455
Uh, Your Honor..

1317
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:08,966
counsel,
members of the jury.

1318
01:13:09,035 --> 01:13:12,471
The evidence in this case
is going to show

1319
01:13:12,538 --> 01:13:16,406
that at 9:30 in the morning
of January 4th,

1320
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,912
both defendants, Stanley Rothenstein
and William Gambini,

1321
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:23,415
were seen getting out
of their metallic green

1322
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:25,917
1964 Buick Skylark
convertible..

1323
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,418
with a white top.

1324
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,921
The evidence
is going to show

1325
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,923
that they were
seen entering

1326
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:35,427
the Sac-O-Suds convenience store
in Wahzoo City.

1327
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,429
The evidence
is going to show

1328
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:40,933
that minutes after they
entered the Sac-O-Suds,

1329
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,935
a gunshot was heard
by three eyewitnesses.

1330
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:47,939
You will then hear the testimony
of the three eyewitnesses

1331
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:51,943
who saw the defendants
running out of the Sac-O-Suds

1332
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:54,445
a moment after the shots
were heard,

1333
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:55,947
getting into their faded

1334
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,949
metallic green
1964 Buick Skylark,

1335
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,451
and driving off
in great haste.

1336
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,954
Finally, the state
is going to prove

1337
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,456
that the defendants
Gambini and Rothenstein

1338
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,959
admitted, then recanted
their testimony,

1339
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:11,622
to the sheriff
of Beechum County.

1340
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,462
Now let's get down
to the lick log.

1341
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:17,901
Your verdict is going
to depend on what you think

1342
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,403
of the sworn testimony.

1343
01:14:19,472 --> 01:14:20,905
Not what I think.

1344
01:14:20,973 --> 01:14:22,804
What I think don't count.

1345
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,308
You're the jury.

1346
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:27,904
It's your job to decide
who's telling the truth.

1347
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:30,414
Truth.. that's
what verdict means.

1348
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:33,418
It's a word comes down
from old England

1349
01:14:33,486 --> 01:14:35,420
and all our
little old ancestors.

1350
01:14:35,488 --> 01:14:39,925
Now, we're going to be
asking you to return a verdict

1351
01:14:39,992 --> 01:14:42,119
of murder
in the first degree

1352
01:14:42,195 --> 01:14:45,028
for William Gambini

1353
01:14:45,098 --> 01:14:48,033
and a verdict
of accessory to murder

1354
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:49,932
in the first degree

1355
01:14:50,002 --> 01:14:51,936
for Stanley Rothenstein

1356
01:14:52,004 --> 01:14:58,500
for helping Gambini
commit this heinous crime.

1357
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:09,085
Counselor,

1358
01:15:09,155 --> 01:15:11,817
you wish to make
an opening statement?

1359
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,724
Counselor!

1360
01:15:22,468 --> 01:15:23,765
What?

1361
01:15:23,836 --> 01:15:26,896
It's time to make
your opening statement.

1362
01:15:26,973 --> 01:15:28,634
Come on, Vin.

1363
01:15:32,812 --> 01:15:33,904
Uh..

1364
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:37,575
everything that guy
just said is bullshit.

1365
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:38,981
Thank you.

1366
01:15:39,051 --> 01:15:40,484
Objection, Your Honor.

1367
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:43,886
Counsel's entire
opening statement is argument.

1368
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,423
Objection sustained.

1369
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:49,222
The entire opening statement
with the exception of "thank you"

1370
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,559
will be stricken
from the record.

1371
01:15:53,099 --> 01:15:55,033
The jury will
please disregard

1372
01:15:55,101 --> 01:15:58,229
counsel's entire
opening statement.

1373
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:00,272
And you, Mr. Gambini,

1374
01:16:00,339 --> 01:16:05,106
you'll not use that kind of language
in my court. You understand?

1375
01:16:05,178 --> 01:16:06,873
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1376
01:16:10,016 --> 01:16:11,142
Putz.

1377
01:16:14,187 --> 01:16:15,586
Counselor.

1378
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:17,782
Your statement, sir.

1379
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:37,533
Well, now..

1380
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:42,138
Uh, ladies and gentlemen
of the j-j-j..

1381
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:46,407
of.. of.. of the j-j-j..

1382
01:16:46,486 --> 01:16:47,475
Ahem!

1383
01:16:48,621 --> 01:16:50,145
Jury! Um..

1384
01:16:51,224 --> 01:16:52,885
on.. on..

1385
01:16:52,959 --> 01:16:54,221
on.. on..

1386
01:16:54,293 --> 01:16:55,225
on..

1387
01:16:55,294 --> 01:17:00,755
January f..

1388
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:03,768
4th of this year,
my client did indeed,

1389
01:17:03,836 --> 01:17:06,930
uh, visit the Sac-O-Suds
co.. um..

1390
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:07,938
con.. um..

1391
01:17:08,007 --> 01:17:10,635
um.. uh..

1392
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,268
uh.. c..

1393
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:13,539
convenience store.

1394
01:17:13,613 --> 01:17:15,478
But.. But!

1395
01:17:16,983 --> 01:17:19,474
He didn't, uh..

1396
01:17:21,287 --> 01:17:22,652
Kill anyone.

1397
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,656
He.. He, uh.. um..

1398
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:25,713
uh..

1399
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:27,759
ahh!

1400
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:30,829
We.. We intend to prove

1401
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,797
that the p..

1402
01:17:32,865 --> 01:17:35,891
p-p-p-p..

1403
01:17:35,968 --> 01:17:40,701
prosecution's case is
circumstantial and.. and.. and..

1404
01:17:40,773 --> 01:17:42,536
ohh..

1405
01:17:42,608 --> 01:17:45,099
uh..

1406
01:17:45,177 --> 01:17:46,109
coincidental.

1407
01:17:46,178 --> 01:17:47,304
Thank you.

1408
01:18:00,393 --> 01:18:01,417
That's it?

1409
01:18:01,494 --> 01:18:03,428
What about everything
we talked about?

1410
01:18:03,496 --> 01:18:04,929
I get a little nervous.

1411
01:18:04,997 --> 01:18:05,929
A little nervous?

1412
01:18:05,998 --> 01:18:07,567
I'm getting better.

1413
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,997
I heard a gunshot,

1414
01:18:09,068 --> 01:18:11,502
so I looked out
the window,

1415
01:18:11,571 --> 01:18:14,438
and I seen them
two boys run out,

1416
01:18:14,507 --> 01:18:17,874
get into their car,
and drive off like maniacs.

1417
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:21,380
The tires screeching, smoking,
going off on the curb.

1418
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,880
Is this the car?

1419
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:24,382
Yes, sir.

1420
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,382
Thank you, sir.

1421
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,885
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1422
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:30,047
Your witness.

1423
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:34,892
All right.

1424
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:37,429
Mr., uh..

1425
01:18:37,496 --> 01:18:39,430
T-T-T-T-T..

1426
01:18:39,498 --> 01:18:40,430
uh..

1427
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:42,831
uh..

1428
01:18:42,902 --> 01:18:43,834
uh, Tipton.

1429
01:18:44,904 --> 01:18:47,702
Now, when you viewed
my client,

1430
01:18:47,773 --> 01:18:49,900
how.. how.. how
far away were you?

1431
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:51,409
About 50 feet.

1432
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,911
Do you think
that's close enough

1433
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:57,609
to make an accurate,
uh, I..

1434
01:18:57,683 --> 01:19:00,413
I-I..

1435
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,044
identification?

1436
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:03,452
Yes.

1437
01:19:06,192 --> 01:19:09,719
Mr. Tipton, I see
you wear eyeglasses.

1438
01:19:09,795 --> 01:19:11,023
Sometimes.

1439
01:19:11,097 --> 01:19:14,760
Would you care to show those
eyeglasses to the jury?

1440
01:19:17,436 --> 01:19:18,869
Thank you. Now,

1441
01:19:18,938 --> 01:19:21,873
Mr. Tipton, were you
wearing them that day?

1442
01:19:21,941 --> 01:19:22,873
No.

1443
01:19:22,942 --> 01:19:25,877
Ha! You see,
you were 50 feet away.

1444
01:19:25,945 --> 01:19:28,379
You made a positive eyewitness
identification

1445
01:19:28,447 --> 01:19:31,382
and.. and.. and..
and.. and.. and..

1446
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:36,786
yet.. you were not
wearing your necessary
prescription eyeglasses.

1447
01:19:36,856 --> 01:19:39,222
They're reading glasses.

1448
01:19:47,299 --> 01:19:48,527
Uh..

1449
01:19:50,836 --> 01:19:51,768
well..

1450
01:19:51,837 --> 01:19:53,896
um.. Mr., uh.. uh..

1451
01:19:53,973 --> 01:19:55,634
uh..

1452
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,232
uh..

1453
01:19:57,309 --> 01:19:59,903
could you tell the court

1454
01:19:59,979 --> 01:20:03,437
what color eyes
the de-defendants have?

1455
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,583
Brown.

1456
01:20:07,653 --> 01:20:08,881
Hazel green.

1457
01:20:13,426 --> 01:20:15,394
No more questions.

1458
01:20:19,999 --> 01:20:21,933
Mr. Gambini,
your witness.

1459
01:20:23,202 --> 01:20:24,931
Ahh! He's a tough one.

1460
01:20:25,004 --> 01:20:26,528
Yes.

1461
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:31,443
Mr. Tipton,
when you viewed the defendants

1462
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:35,037
walking from their car into
the Sac-O-Suds,

1463
01:20:35,114 --> 01:20:37,776
what angle was
your point of view?

1464
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:40,444
They was kind of
walking toward me

1465
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:42,146
when they
entered the store.

1466
01:20:42,221 --> 01:20:44,485
And when they left,
what was your point of view?

1467
01:20:44,557 --> 01:20:47,958
They was kind of
walking away from me.

1468
01:20:48,027 --> 01:20:50,962
So you got a better shot
of them going in

1469
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,123
and not so much
coming out?

1470
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,530
You could say that.

1471
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,898
I did say that.
Would you say that?

1472
01:20:56,969 --> 01:20:58,459
Yeah.

1473
01:20:58,537 --> 01:21:02,064
Is it possible
the two youts..

1474
01:21:02,141 --> 01:21:04,109
Uh, two what?

1475
01:21:06,378 --> 01:21:08,471
What was that word?

1476
01:21:08,547 --> 01:21:10,481
Uh, what word?

1477
01:21:10,549 --> 01:21:11,948
Two what?

1478
01:21:12,017 --> 01:21:12,984
What?

1479
01:21:13,052 --> 01:21:15,077
Did you say youts?

1480
01:21:15,154 --> 01:21:16,485
Yeah, two youts.

1481
01:21:16,555 --> 01:21:18,022
What is a yout?

1482
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,490
Oh, excuse me,
Your Honor.

1483
01:21:20,559 --> 01:21:22,390
Two youths.

1484
01:21:29,001 --> 01:21:32,368
Is it possible
the two defendants

1485
01:21:32,438 --> 01:21:37,398
entered the store, picked 22 specific
items off the shelves,

1486
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,445
had the clerk
take money, make change,

1487
01:21:40,513 --> 01:21:41,946
then leave?

1488
01:21:42,014 --> 01:21:45,575
Then two different men
drive up in a similar..

1489
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,949
Don't shake your head.
I'm not done yet.

1490
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:50,454
Wait till you hear
the whole thing.

1491
01:21:50,523 --> 01:21:54,459
Two different men drive up in
a similar-looking car,

1492
01:21:54,527 --> 01:21:56,461
go in, shoot the clerk,

1493
01:21:56,529 --> 01:21:58,429
rob him, and then leave?

1494
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:01,057
No. They didn't
have enough time.

1495
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:03,465
How much time
was they in the store?

1496
01:22:03,536 --> 01:22:04,560
Five minutes.

1497
01:22:04,637 --> 01:22:07,970
Are you sure?
Did you look at your watch?

1498
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,974
Oh, I'm sorry.
You testified earlier

1499
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:12,476
that the boys went
into the store,

1500
01:22:12,545 --> 01:22:14,479
you'd just begun
to make breakfast,

1501
01:22:14,547 --> 01:22:18,313
you were ready to eat,
and you heard a gunshot.

1502
01:22:18,384 --> 01:22:21,911
So, obviously, it takes you
five minutes to make breakfast.

1503
01:22:21,987 --> 01:22:22,919
That's right.

1504
01:22:22,988 --> 01:22:24,922
Do you remember
what you had?

1505
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,321
Eggs and grits.

1506
01:22:26,392 --> 01:22:27,654
Eggs and grits.

1507
01:22:27,726 --> 01:22:29,057
I like grits, too.

1508
01:22:29,128 --> 01:22:30,789
How do you cook yours?

1509
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,854
Regular, creamy,
or al dente?

1510
01:22:35,634 --> 01:22:37,124
Just regular, I guess.

1511
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:38,932
Regular.

1512
01:22:39,004 --> 01:22:40,301
Instant grits?

1513
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:43,102
No self-respecting
Southerner uses instant grits.

1514
01:22:43,175 --> 01:22:45,268
I take pride in my grits.

1515
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,145
So, Mr. Tipton,

1516
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:51,149
how could it take you
five minutes

1517
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,583
to cook your grits

1518
01:22:53,652 --> 01:22:57,110
when it takes the entire
grit-eating world

1519
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:59,180
20 minutes?

1520
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:07,965
I don't know.
I'm a fast cook, I guess.

1521
01:23:08,033 --> 01:23:10,467
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you.

1522
01:23:10,536 --> 01:23:14,131
Did you say you're a fast cook?
That's it?

1523
01:23:14,206 --> 01:23:18,575
Are we to believe
that boiling water soaks into a grit

1524
01:23:18,644 --> 01:23:20,077
faster in your kitchen

1525
01:23:20,145 --> 01:23:24,047
than anyplace
on the face of the earth?

1526
01:23:24,116 --> 01:23:25,708
I don't know.

1527
01:23:25,784 --> 01:23:30,915
Well, perhaps the laws of physics
cease to exist on your stove.

1528
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:32,924
Were these magic grits?

1529
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,927
Did you buy them
from the same guy

1530
01:23:35,995 --> 01:23:38,429
who sold Jack
his beanstalk beans?

1531
01:23:38,497 --> 01:23:39,555
Objection!

1532
01:23:39,632 --> 01:23:42,066
Objection sustained.
Ignore the question.

1533
01:23:42,134 --> 01:23:44,329
Are you sure about
that five minutes?

1534
01:23:44,403 --> 01:23:45,370
I don't know.

1535
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:46,870
You've made your point.

1536
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,873
Are you sure about
that five minutes?

1537
01:23:51,543 --> 01:23:54,273
I may have been mistaken.

1538
01:23:56,348 --> 01:23:58,612
I got no more use
for this guy.

1539
01:24:08,027 --> 01:24:09,688
You're fired.

1540
01:24:09,762 --> 01:24:11,821
I want him.

1541
01:24:13,599 --> 01:24:15,965
Come on, now.
Move it.

1542
01:24:16,035 --> 01:24:19,630
Don't worry. I'll find a way
to bail you out.

1543
01:24:19,705 --> 01:24:21,639
Don't. I'll stay in prison tonight.

1544
01:24:21,707 --> 01:24:24,141
Maybe I'll finally
get some sleep.

1545
01:24:42,628 --> 01:24:44,289
Hey. How you doing?

1546
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:49,729
Hey, Mr. Crane,
what are these pictures of?

1547
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,902
My house and stuff.

1548
01:24:52,972 --> 01:24:54,439
House and stuff.

1549
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:59,705
And what is this
brown stuff on the windows?

1550
01:24:59,778 --> 01:25:00,836
Dirt.

1551
01:25:00,913 --> 01:25:03,438
Dirt.

1552
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,449
What is this rusty,

1553
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:08,782
dusty, dirty-looking
thing over your window?

1554
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,957
It's a screen.

1555
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,253
A screen!

1556
01:25:14,326 --> 01:25:15,953
It's a screen.

1557
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:18,394
And what are these
really big things

1558
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,399
right in the middle
of your view

1559
01:25:21,467 --> 01:25:25,403
from the window of your kitchen
to the Sac-O-Suds?

1560
01:25:25,471 --> 01:25:27,905
What do we call
these big things?

1561
01:25:29,975 --> 01:25:31,237
Trees?

1562
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:32,743
Trees, that's right.

1563
01:25:32,811 --> 01:25:35,405
You shout them right out
when you know.

1564
01:25:35,481 --> 01:25:38,416
Now, what are these
thousands of little things

1565
01:25:38,484 --> 01:25:39,917
that are on trees?

1566
01:25:41,987 --> 01:25:42,919
Leaves.

1567
01:25:42,988 --> 01:25:44,250
Leaves!

1568
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:49,418
And these bushy things
between the trees?

1569
01:25:49,495 --> 01:25:50,427
Bushes.

1570
01:25:50,496 --> 01:25:51,929
Bushes. Right.

1571
01:25:51,997 --> 01:25:53,931
So, Mr. Crane,

1572
01:25:53,999 --> 01:25:57,594
you could positively
identify the defendants

1573
01:25:57,669 --> 01:26:00,103
for a moment
of two seconds

1574
01:26:00,172 --> 01:26:02,106
looking through
this dirty window,

1575
01:26:02,174 --> 01:26:05,666
this crud-covered screen..

1576
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:08,440
these trees..

1577
01:26:08,514 --> 01:26:10,948
with all these leaves
on them..

1578
01:26:11,016 --> 01:26:13,450
and I don't know
how many bushes.

1579
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:19,018
There's, like, five.

1580
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,992
Uh-uh. Don't forget
this one and this one.

1581
01:26:22,061 --> 01:26:22,993
Seven bushes.

1582
01:26:23,062 --> 01:26:24,393
Seven bushes. So..

1583
01:26:24,463 --> 01:26:25,953
what do you think?

1584
01:26:26,031 --> 01:26:30,400
Is it possible you just saw two guys
in a green convertible

1585
01:26:30,469 --> 01:26:33,632
and not necessarily
these two particular guys?

1586
01:26:35,074 --> 01:26:36,166
I suppose.

1587
01:26:36,241 --> 01:26:38,266
I'm finished
with this guy.

1588
01:26:45,984 --> 01:26:48,919
Mrs. Riley,
when you saw the defendants,

1589
01:26:48,987 --> 01:26:51,217
were you wearing
your glasses?

1590
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:52,689
Yes, I was.

1591
01:26:53,892 --> 01:26:54,824
Over here, dear.

1592
01:26:56,495 --> 01:26:59,191
Would you mind putting
your glasses on

1593
01:26:59,264 --> 01:27:00,697
for us, please?

1594
01:27:06,505 --> 01:27:07,437
Whoa!

1595
01:27:07,506 --> 01:27:09,940
How long you been
wearing glasses?

1596
01:27:10,008 --> 01:27:11,407
Since I was 6.

1597
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:13,206
Have they always
been that thick?

1598
01:27:13,278 --> 01:27:16,111
Oh, no. They got
thicker over the years.

1599
01:27:16,181 --> 01:27:20,675
So, as your eyes have gotten
more and more out of whack

1600
01:27:20,752 --> 01:27:22,219
as you've gotten older,

1601
01:27:22,287 --> 01:27:25,381
how many levels of thickness
have you gone through?

1602
01:27:25,457 --> 01:27:26,890
Oh, I don't know.

1603
01:27:26,959 --> 01:27:30,861
Over 60 years..
maybe 10 times.

1604
01:27:30,929 --> 01:27:33,864
Maybe you're ready
for a thicker set.

1605
01:27:33,932 --> 01:27:36,400
Oh, no.
No, I think they're OK.

1606
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:38,197
Maybe we should
make sure.

1607
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:39,669
Let's check it out.

1608
01:27:44,476 --> 01:27:47,411
Now, how far were
the defendants from you

1609
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:51,415
when you saw them
entering the Sac-O-Suds?

1610
01:27:51,483 --> 01:27:52,916
About.. 100 feet.

1611
01:27:52,985 --> 01:27:55,749
100 feet.
Would you hold this, please?

1612
01:27:55,821 --> 01:27:56,753
Thank you.

1613
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:00,924
Sorry.

1614
01:28:00,993 --> 01:28:02,153
Excuse me.

1615
01:28:02,227 --> 01:28:03,159
Sorry.

1616
01:28:03,228 --> 01:28:04,160
Sorry.

1617
01:28:06,832 --> 01:28:07,799
OK.

1618
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,993
This is 50 feet.

1619
01:28:10,068 --> 01:28:12,764
That's half the distance.

1620
01:28:12,838 --> 01:28:14,965
How many fingers
am I holding up?

1621
01:28:16,675 --> 01:28:18,108
Let the record show

1622
01:28:18,177 --> 01:28:20,270
that counsel's holding up
two fingers.

1623
01:28:20,345 --> 01:28:23,314
Your Honor,
please, huh?

1624
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:24,508
Oh.

1625
01:28:25,851 --> 01:28:26,783
Sorry.

1626
01:28:26,852 --> 01:28:29,480
Now.. Mrs. Riley,

1627
01:28:29,555 --> 01:28:32,422
and only Mrs. Riley..

1628
01:28:34,092 --> 01:28:37,220
how many fingers
am I holding up now?

1629
01:28:42,467 --> 01:28:43,491
Four.

1630
01:28:49,508 --> 01:28:51,567
What do you think
now, dear?

1631
01:28:53,045 --> 01:28:56,105
I'm thinking of getting
thicker glasses.

1632
01:28:56,181 --> 01:28:57,648
Thank you.

1633
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:08,726
Hello.

1634
01:29:08,794 --> 01:29:10,261
You did good
today, Yankee.

1635
01:29:10,329 --> 01:29:11,660
I like the competition.

1636
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:13,061
You like competition, too?

1637
01:29:13,131 --> 01:29:15,395
Makes things kind
of fun, doesn't it?

1638
01:29:15,467 --> 01:29:17,196
I'm enjoying myself
so far.

1639
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:20,204
Well, I got a little surprise
for you tomorrow.

1640
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:23,400
What? You know you have to disclose
all your evidence.

1641
01:29:23,475 --> 01:29:25,375
I just got it
myself tonight.

1642
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,378
I'll disclose it
first thing tomorrow.

1643
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:29,175
Judge's going to have
to admit it.

1644
01:29:29,248 --> 01:29:31,512
Should I be worried?

1645
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,881
I sure would be
if I were you.

1646
01:29:39,992 --> 01:29:44,759
Honey, where did you read
about all that disclosure shit?

1647
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:46,559
Let me show you.

1648
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:47,929
Why?

1649
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,898
I'm a special automotive instructor
of forensic studies

1650
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:53,233
for the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

1651
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,899
How long you been
in that position?

1652
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:56,906
18 years.

1653
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:59,910
Your Honor,
may we approach the bench?

1654
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,411
If you wish.

1655
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,921
Ahem. I object to this witness

1656
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,422
being called
at this time.

1657
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:14,925
We've been given no
prior notice he'd testify,

1658
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:16,460
no discovery
of tests conducted,

1659
01:30:16,528 --> 01:30:17,961
or reports
he's prepared.

1660
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,931
As the court is aware,
the defense is entitled

1661
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,433
to advance notice
of any witness,

1662
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,936
particularly those who will
give scientific evidence,

1663
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,939
so we can prepare
for cross-examination

1664
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:32,943
as well as have the report
reviewed by a defense expert

1665
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:34,444
who might then be able

1666
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:38,813
to contradict the veracity
of his conclusions.

1667
01:30:38,884 --> 01:30:43,821
Mr. Gambini,
that is a lucid, intelligent,

1668
01:30:43,889 --> 01:30:45,982
well-thought out objection.

1669
01:30:46,058 --> 01:30:47,286
Thank you, Your Honor.

1670
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:48,519
Overruled.

1671
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:58,666
Now..

1672
01:30:58,737 --> 01:31:00,329
Mr. Wilbur.

1673
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:05,809
These are photos
of tires belonging
to the defendants' car.

1674
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,812
And these are photos
of the tire marks

1675
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,340
left by the assailants' car
as it fled the convenience store.

1676
01:31:13,418 --> 01:31:15,113
Are you familiar
with these?

1677
01:31:15,187 --> 01:31:16,415
Yes, I am.

1678
01:31:16,488 --> 01:31:18,422
Could you elaborate,
please, sir?

1679
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:21,926
We compared the tire marks
outside the convenience store

1680
01:31:21,993 --> 01:31:25,429
with the rear tires
of the defendants' car.

1681
01:31:25,497 --> 01:31:28,933
They're the same model
and size tire.

1682
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,300
Michelin model XGV,
size 75-R, 14-inch wheel.

1683
01:31:33,372 --> 01:31:34,805
They're the same size

1684
01:31:34,873 --> 01:31:36,431
and model tire.

1685
01:31:36,508 --> 01:31:38,601
Anything else, sir?

1686
01:31:38,677 --> 01:31:39,769
Yes, indeed.

1687
01:31:39,845 --> 01:31:41,938
The car, leaving
the convenience store,

1688
01:31:42,013 --> 01:31:43,446
spun its rear tires
dramatically

1689
01:31:43,515 --> 01:31:46,450
and left a residue of rubber
on the asphalt.

1690
01:31:46,518 --> 01:31:49,453
I analyzed a sample
of that rubber.

1691
01:31:49,521 --> 01:31:53,457
I also took a sample
of rubber from the rear tires

1692
01:31:53,525 --> 01:31:54,958
from the defendants' Buick

1693
01:31:55,026 --> 01:31:56,459
and analyzed that, too.

1694
01:31:56,528 --> 01:31:59,656
What equipment did you
use to find this out?

1695
01:31:59,731 --> 01:32:02,962
A Hewlett-Packard 5710A
dual column gas chromatograph

1696
01:32:03,034 --> 01:32:05,730
with flame analyzation
detectors.

1697
01:32:05,804 --> 01:32:06,964
Uh-huh.

1698
01:32:07,038 --> 01:32:09,529
Is that thing
turbo-charged?

1699
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:11,542
Only on the floor models.

1700
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:13,043
Now, Mr. Wilbur,

1701
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:16,046
what was the result
of your analysis?

1702
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:19,413
The chemical composition
between the two samples

1703
01:32:19,484 --> 01:32:21,918
was found to be identical.

1704
01:32:21,987 --> 01:32:23,955
I.. dentical!

1705
01:32:29,227 --> 01:32:31,161
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1706
01:32:32,397 --> 01:32:33,329
Your Honor.

1707
01:32:33,398 --> 01:32:35,263
Thank you, Mr. Wilbur.

1708
01:32:36,601 --> 01:32:40,401
The court will take
a 60-minute recess for lunch.

1709
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:43,441
I respectfully request
a full day's continuance

1710
01:32:43,508 --> 01:32:46,068
to go over all
this sh.. stuff.

1711
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:47,577
Request denied.

1712
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:49,079
Thanks a lot.

1713
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:50,114
Mr. Gambini.

1714
01:32:50,182 --> 01:32:51,410
Yes, sir.

1715
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:54,919
I'd like to speak
to you in my chambers.

1716
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:56,578
You're a dead man.

1717
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:57,952
I'm a dead man?

1718
01:32:58,023 --> 01:33:00,457
That's right.
I just faxed new york

1719
01:33:00,525 --> 01:33:03,961
and asked them what they knew
about Jerry Gallo.

1720
01:33:04,029 --> 01:33:05,462
You know what
they replied?

1721
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:06,963
Did you say Jerry Gallo?

1722
01:33:07,032 --> 01:33:07,964
I did.

1723
01:33:08,033 --> 01:33:10,467
Gallo with a "G"?
Jerry Gallo's dead.

1724
01:33:10,535 --> 01:33:11,968
I'm aware of that.

1725
01:33:12,037 --> 01:33:13,470
Well, I'm not Jerry Gallo.

1726
01:33:13,538 --> 01:33:15,972
I'm Jerry Callo!

1727
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:18,601
C-A-L-L-O.

1728
01:33:24,983 --> 01:33:25,950
All right.

1729
01:33:27,986 --> 01:33:29,112
All right.

1730
01:33:34,926 --> 01:33:37,724
Let's get this
cleared up right now.

1731
01:33:46,004 --> 01:33:48,438
Hello. This is Judge
Chamberlain Haller.

1732
01:33:48,507 --> 01:33:50,475
Can I speak to the clerk?

1733
01:33:52,944 --> 01:33:54,434
OK, I'll be here.

1734
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:58,213
He's going to call back
after 3:00.

1735
01:33:59,518 --> 01:34:02,783
That gives you
a stay of execution..

1736
01:34:02,854 --> 01:34:04,287
Unless by some miracle

1737
01:34:04,356 --> 01:34:08,122
you happen to win this case
in the next 90 minutes.

1738
01:34:10,328 --> 01:34:12,728
Why don't you go to lunch?

1739
01:34:26,544 --> 01:34:27,602
Thanks.

1740
01:34:36,787 --> 01:34:38,414
I got my pictures back.

1741
01:34:38,489 --> 01:34:39,478
Oh, good.

1742
01:34:40,691 --> 01:34:42,921
What did the judge say?

1743
01:34:42,993 --> 01:34:46,929
He said he found out
that Gallo's dead.

1744
01:34:46,997 --> 01:34:48,931
He found out.

1745
01:34:48,999 --> 01:34:50,432
What'd he say?

1746
01:34:51,835 --> 01:34:55,771
Lisa, I'm trying to think
about the case now, OK?

1747
01:34:55,839 --> 01:34:56,863
I'm sorry.

1748
01:34:58,509 --> 01:34:59,942
Can I help?

1749
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:02,444
"Can I help?"
No, you can't help.

1750
01:35:02,513 --> 01:35:04,947
I wish you could,
but you can't.

1751
01:35:08,018 --> 01:35:09,952
Look how
you're looking at me.

1752
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:11,510
What's that look
supposed to mean?

1753
01:35:11,589 --> 01:35:12,954
I'm a piece of shit

1754
01:35:13,023 --> 01:35:16,288
'Cause I can't figure out
how you can help?

1755
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:20,062
OK. You're helping.

1756
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:22,064
We'll use your pictures.

1757
01:35:22,132 --> 01:35:23,429
Ah!

1758
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:26,401
These are.. I'm sorry.
These are going to help.

1759
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:29,530
I should have looked
at these before.

1760
01:35:29,607 --> 01:35:31,404
This is our first
hotel room.

1761
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:32,772
That'll intimidate Trotter.

1762
01:35:32,843 --> 01:35:34,401
One of me from behind.

1763
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:36,912
And I didn't think
I could feel worse

1764
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:39,916
than I did a couple of seconds ago.
Thank you.

1765
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,918
Good one of
the tire marks.

1766
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:44,420
Could we get
any farther away?

1767
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:46,922
You shoot this
from up in a tree?

1768
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,015
What's this?

1769
01:35:49,293 --> 01:35:51,727
It's dog shit.

1770
01:35:51,795 --> 01:35:52,921
Dog shit! That's great!

1771
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,760
Dog shit. What a clue!

1772
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:56,766
Why didn't I
think of that?

1773
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:58,233
One of me reading.
Terrific.

1774
01:35:58,302 --> 01:36:00,566
I should've asked you
sooner for these pictures.

1775
01:36:00,638 --> 01:36:02,105
Holy shit!

1776
01:36:02,172 --> 01:36:03,434
You got it, honey.

1777
01:36:03,507 --> 01:36:04,531
You did it!

1778
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:07,202
The case-cracker!
Me in the shower!

1779
01:36:07,277 --> 01:36:08,938
Ha ha! I love this.

1780
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,105
That's it!

1781
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,807
That is it!

1782
01:36:11,882 --> 01:36:13,941
I'm out of here.

1783
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:17,609
Lisa!

1784
01:36:19,923 --> 01:36:21,185
Lisa!

1785
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:24,788
I'm sorry.

1786
01:36:26,096 --> 01:36:27,154
Fuck.

1787
01:36:41,478 --> 01:36:43,412
I know I'm missing something.

1788
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,913
I'm missing something.

1789
01:37:04,001 --> 01:37:05,935
Did you find anything?

1790
01:37:06,003 --> 01:37:07,436
Very, very little.

1791
01:37:09,339 --> 01:37:10,271
Something?

1792
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,705
Nothing.

1793
01:37:15,112 --> 01:37:18,878
Is it possible
that two separate cars

1794
01:37:18,949 --> 01:37:24,285
could be driving on Michelin model
XGV 75-R-14s?

1795
01:37:24,354 --> 01:37:25,651
Of course.

1796
01:37:25,723 --> 01:37:27,657
Let me ask you this.

1797
01:37:27,725 --> 01:37:30,660
What's the best-selling
single model tire

1798
01:37:30,728 --> 01:37:33,060
being sold in the
United States today?

1799
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:35,724
The Michelin XGV.

1800
01:37:35,799 --> 01:37:37,858
And what's
the most popular size?

1801
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:39,766
75-R-14.

1802
01:37:39,837 --> 01:37:42,772
The same size as on
the defendants' car?

1803
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:47,402
But two faded green 1964 Buick Skylark
convertibles?

1804
01:37:47,478 --> 01:37:49,412
Excuse me.

1805
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,913
What I'm asking you

1806
01:37:50,981 --> 01:37:53,415
is if
the most popular size

1807
01:37:53,484 --> 01:37:55,918
of the most popular tire

1808
01:37:55,986 --> 01:37:58,580
is on
the defendants' car.

1809
01:37:58,655 --> 01:37:59,815
Well..

1810
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:02,849
yeah.

1811
01:38:02,926 --> 01:38:05,417
Yes.

1812
01:38:05,496 --> 01:38:06,485
Um..

1813
01:38:06,563 --> 01:38:07,621
thank you.

1814
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,161
No further questions.

1815
01:38:13,003 --> 01:38:15,267
Uh, the witness
can stand down.

1816
01:38:16,607 --> 01:38:18,370
Counsel?

1817
01:38:18,442 --> 01:38:22,208
Uh, Your Honor,
the prosecution rests.

1818
01:38:25,616 --> 01:38:27,379
Mr. Gambini..

1819
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:28,941
your first witness.

1820
01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:41,464
Mr. Gambini?

1821
01:38:41,532 --> 01:38:43,523
I will ask you
one more time

1822
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,966
and one more time only.

1823
01:38:46,036 --> 01:38:47,970
If I ask you again..

1824
01:38:48,038 --> 01:38:49,471
Your Honor, uh..

1825
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:52,976
please, uh, can I have
a five-minute recess?

1826
01:38:53,043 --> 01:38:55,671
My next witness is not
in the courtroom now.

1827
01:38:55,746 --> 01:38:57,213
Three minutes.

1828
01:38:57,281 --> 01:38:58,680
No more.

1829
01:39:10,994 --> 01:39:12,928
Sheriff, do me a favor.

1830
01:39:12,996 --> 01:39:14,429
Please trace this.

1831
01:39:14,498 --> 01:39:15,931
It's not my job.

1832
01:39:15,999 --> 01:39:17,864
You do your own
investigating.

1833
01:39:17,935 --> 01:39:19,869
I only have
three minutes.

1834
01:39:25,309 --> 01:39:26,367
Lisa, listen.

1835
01:39:26,443 --> 01:39:27,876
Please, I'm sorry, OK?

1836
01:39:27,945 --> 01:39:31,381
I need you to come back
into the courtroom,

1837
01:39:31,448 --> 01:39:32,881
and I need the phone.

1838
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:36,386
Come on now. Stop it.
I need the phone.

1839
01:39:36,453 --> 01:39:37,545
Let's make up.

1840
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:38,883
We got to go
back inside.

1841
01:39:38,956 --> 01:39:40,389
Everybody's
waiting for us.

1842
01:39:40,457 --> 01:39:41,389
Shut up.

1843
01:39:41,458 --> 01:39:42,891
Give me this phone.

1844
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,892
Fuck you!

1845
01:39:43,961 --> 01:39:46,896
What is it with you
with that mouth?

1846
01:39:46,964 --> 01:39:47,896
Mr. Gambini?

1847
01:39:47,965 --> 01:39:49,398
Yeah. How are you?

1848
01:39:49,466 --> 01:39:51,161
Tell me why.

1849
01:39:52,469 --> 01:39:54,403
Lisa, I need your help.

1850
01:39:54,471 --> 01:39:57,406
I don't give a shit.
Leave me alone.

1851
01:39:57,474 --> 01:39:59,237
Come on. I found it.
You'll see.

1852
01:39:59,309 --> 01:40:00,241
Aah!

1853
01:40:04,381 --> 01:40:06,246
Your Honor,
the defense calls

1854
01:40:06,316 --> 01:40:09,410
as its first witness
Ms. Mona Lisa Vito.

1855
01:40:09,486 --> 01:40:10,748
I object, Your Honor.

1856
01:40:10,821 --> 01:40:13,483
This person is not
on the witness list.

1857
01:40:13,557 --> 01:40:16,219
This witness is
a expert on automobiles

1858
01:40:16,293 --> 01:40:17,726
and is being called

1859
01:40:17,794 --> 01:40:20,729
to rebut the testimony
of George Wilbur.

1860
01:40:20,797 --> 01:40:23,732
Your Honor, would you please
instruct the bailiff

1861
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:26,291
to escort Ms. Vito
to the witness stand?

1862
01:40:39,016 --> 01:40:40,950
Hold up
your right hand.

1863
01:40:41,018 --> 01:40:42,918
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

1864
01:40:42,986 --> 01:40:44,078
the whole truth,

1865
01:40:44,154 --> 01:40:46,315
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1866
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:47,357
Yeah.

1867
01:40:51,028 --> 01:40:52,461
Ms. Vito..

1868
01:40:52,529 --> 01:40:55,965
uh, you're supposed
to be some kind of expert

1869
01:40:56,033 --> 01:40:58,126
in automobiles,
is that correct?

1870
01:41:01,538 --> 01:41:02,971
Is that correct?

1871
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:05,974
Would you please answer

1872
01:41:06,043 --> 01:41:07,476
the counselor's
question?

1873
01:41:07,544 --> 01:41:08,977
No. I hate him.

1874
01:41:09,046 --> 01:41:10,138
May I have permission

1875
01:41:10,213 --> 01:41:12,977
to treat Ms. Vito
as a hostile witness?

1876
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:14,745
You think
I'm hostile now,

1877
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:16,115
wait till tonight.

1878
01:41:16,186 --> 01:41:19,053
Uh, do you two
know each other?

1879
01:41:19,122 --> 01:41:20,555
Yeah, she's my fiancée.

1880
01:41:20,624 --> 01:41:23,559
Well, that would certainly
explain the hostility.

1881
01:41:23,627 --> 01:41:25,891
Your Honor,
I object to this witness.

1882
01:41:25,963 --> 01:41:26,930
Improper foundation.

1883
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:29,192
I'm not aware
of her qualifications.

1884
01:41:29,266 --> 01:41:32,099
I'd like to, uh,
voir dire this witness

1885
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:35,627
as to the extent
of her expertise.

1886
01:41:35,706 --> 01:41:37,071
Granted.

1887
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:39,631
Mr. Trotter,
you may proceed.

1888
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:40,642
Mm-hmm.

1889
01:41:40,711 --> 01:41:41,678
Oh.

1890
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,614
Ms. Vito, what's
your current profession?

1891
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:48,810
I'm an out-of-work
hairdresser.

1892
01:41:48,885 --> 01:41:50,443
"Out-of-work hairdresser."

1893
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:53,114
Now, in what way
does that qualify you

1894
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,885
as an expert
in automobiles?

1895
01:41:54,958 --> 01:41:55,925
It doesn't.

1896
01:41:55,993 --> 01:41:57,893
In what way
are you qualified?

1897
01:41:57,961 --> 01:42:00,395
Well, my father was a mechanic.

1898
01:42:00,464 --> 01:42:02,398
His father
was a mechanic.

1899
01:42:02,466 --> 01:42:05,526
My mother's father
was a mechanic.

1900
01:42:05,602 --> 01:42:07,536
My three brothers
are mechanics.

1901
01:42:07,604 --> 01:42:09,936
Four uncles on my father's side
are mechanics.

1902
01:42:10,007 --> 01:42:12,475
Ms. Vito, your family's
obviously qualified,

1903
01:42:12,542 --> 01:42:15,978
but, uh, have you ever
worked as a mechanic?

1904
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:19,072
Yeah, in my father's
garage. Yeah.

1905
01:42:19,149 --> 01:42:20,707
As a mechanic?

1906
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:25,980
What did you do
in your father's garage?

1907
01:42:27,491 --> 01:42:30,756
Tune-ups, oil changes,
brake relining,

1908
01:42:30,827 --> 01:42:32,021
engine rebuilds,

1909
01:42:32,095 --> 01:42:34,029
rebuilt some trannies,
rear ends.

1910
01:42:34,097 --> 01:42:36,930
OK, OK, but does
being an ex-mechanic

1911
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,935
necessarily qualify you
as being expert on tire marks?

1912
01:42:40,003 --> 01:42:40,970
No.

1913
01:42:41,038 --> 01:42:42,869
Thank you. Goodbye.

1914
01:42:42,939 --> 01:42:47,933
Sit down and stay there
until you're told to leave.

1915
01:42:49,613 --> 01:42:51,945
Your Honor,
Ms. Vito's expertise

1916
01:42:52,015 --> 01:42:54,415
is in general
automotive knowledge.

1917
01:42:54,484 --> 01:42:58,147
It is in this area
that her testimony will be applicable.

1918
01:42:58,221 --> 01:43:01,622
If Mr. Trotter wishes
to voir dire the witness

1919
01:43:01,691 --> 01:43:04,751
as to the extent of her
expertise in this area,

1920
01:43:04,828 --> 01:43:10,095
I'm sure he's going to
be more than satisfied.

1921
01:43:10,167 --> 01:43:11,532
OK.

1922
01:43:13,537 --> 01:43:14,663
All right.

1923
01:43:14,738 --> 01:43:15,966
All right.

1924
01:43:16,039 --> 01:43:19,099
Now, uh, Ms.. Vito?

1925
01:43:19,176 --> 01:43:23,112
Being an expert on general
automotive knowledge..

1926
01:43:24,314 --> 01:43:25,747
can you tell me

1927
01:43:25,816 --> 01:43:30,082
what would the correct
ignition timing be

1928
01:43:30,153 --> 01:43:32,587
on a 1955
Bel Air Chevrolet

1929
01:43:32,656 --> 01:43:35,420
with a 327-cubic inch engine

1930
01:43:35,492 --> 01:43:37,926
and a four-barrel carburetor?

1931
01:43:37,994 --> 01:43:39,427
That's a bullshit question.

1932
01:43:39,496 --> 01:43:42,431
Does that mean that you
can't answer it?

1933
01:43:42,499 --> 01:43:43,761
It's a bullshit question.

1934
01:43:43,834 --> 01:43:45,267
It's impossible to answer.

1935
01:43:45,335 --> 01:43:47,929
Impossible because you
don't know the answer!

1936
01:43:48,004 --> 01:43:49,198
Nobody could answer that.

1937
01:43:49,272 --> 01:43:51,934
Your Honor,
I move to disqualify Ms. Vito

1938
01:43:52,008 --> 01:43:53,339
as an expert witness.

1939
01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:55,537
Can you answer
the question?

1940
01:43:55,612 --> 01:43:58,012
No. It is a trick question.

1941
01:43:58,081 --> 01:44:00,481
Why is it a trick question?

1942
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:02,017
Watch this.

1943
01:44:02,085 --> 01:44:04,610
Chevy didn't make
a 327 in '55.

1944
01:44:04,688 --> 01:44:06,849
The 327 came out in '62.

1945
01:44:06,923 --> 01:44:09,289
It wasn't offered
in the Bel Air

1946
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:11,224
with the four-barrel carb
till '64.

1947
01:44:11,294 --> 01:44:13,558
However, in 1964,
the correct ignition timing

1948
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:16,963
would be 4 degrees
before top dead center.

1949
01:44:19,302 --> 01:44:20,929
Well..

1950
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:22,130
uh..

1951
01:44:24,808 --> 01:44:26,435
she's acceptable,
Your Honor.

1952
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:33,916
Your Honor, this is a picture
taken by my fiancée

1953
01:44:33,984 --> 01:44:35,918
outside the Sac-O-Suds.

1954
01:44:35,986 --> 01:44:38,420
Do we agree on this?

1955
01:44:38,488 --> 01:44:39,921
Yeah.

1956
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:41,423
Thank you.

1957
01:44:41,491 --> 01:44:43,925
I'd like to submit
this picture

1958
01:44:43,994 --> 01:44:46,758
of the tire tracks
as evidence.

1959
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:48,058
Mr. Trotter?

1960
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,195
No objection,
Your Honor.

1961
01:44:58,008 --> 01:45:01,205
Ms. Vito, did you
take this picture?

1962
01:45:01,278 --> 01:45:02,711
You know I did.

1963
01:45:02,779 --> 01:45:04,713
What is this picture of?

1964
01:45:04,781 --> 01:45:06,578
You know what it's of.

1965
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:07,582
Ms. Vito..

1966
01:45:07,651 --> 01:45:10,449
it has been argued
by me, the defense,

1967
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:14,923
that two sets of guys
met up at the Sac-O-Suds

1968
01:45:14,991 --> 01:45:16,083
at the same time

1969
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:17,387
driving identical

1970
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:23,421
metallic mint-green
1964 Buick skylark convertibles.

1971
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:27,402
Can you tell us by what
you see in this picture

1972
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:29,904
if the defense's case
holds water?

1973
01:45:38,615 --> 01:45:41,914
Ms. Vito, please
answer the question.

1974
01:45:41,985 --> 01:45:46,081
Does the defense's
case hold water?

1975
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:51,252
No.

1976
01:45:52,762 --> 01:45:54,559
The defense is wrong.

1977
01:45:54,631 --> 01:45:56,895
Oh, Jesus.

1978
01:45:56,967 --> 01:45:59,959
Are you sure?

1979
01:46:00,036 --> 01:46:02,630
I'm positive.

1980
01:46:02,706 --> 01:46:05,072
How could you
be so sure?

1981
01:46:05,141 --> 01:46:08,076
Because there is no way
these tire marks

1982
01:46:08,144 --> 01:46:10,840
were made by
a '64 Buick Skylark.

1983
01:46:10,914 --> 01:46:14,111
These marks were made by
a 1963 Pontiac tempest.

1984
01:46:14,184 --> 01:46:16,709
Objection, Your Honor.
Can we clarify to the court

1985
01:46:16,786 --> 01:46:19,118
whether the witness
is stating opinion or fact?

1986
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:20,486
This is your opinion?

1987
01:46:20,557 --> 01:46:21,990
It's a fact.

1988
01:46:22,058 --> 01:46:24,686
I find it
hard to believe

1989
01:46:24,761 --> 01:46:26,695
that this kind
of information

1990
01:46:26,763 --> 01:46:30,597
could be ascertained
simply by looking at a picture!

1991
01:46:30,667 --> 01:46:32,999
Would you like me
to explain?

1992
01:46:33,069 --> 01:46:35,367
I would love
to hear this.

1993
01:46:35,438 --> 01:46:36,928
So would I.

1994
01:46:37,007 --> 01:46:41,410
The car that made these
two equal-length tire
marks had positraction.

1995
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:44,276
You can't make those marks
without positraction,

1996
01:46:44,347 --> 01:46:47,783
which was not available
on the '64 Buick Skylark.

1997
01:46:47,851 --> 01:46:49,148
And why not?

1998
01:46:49,219 --> 01:46:51,517
What is positraction?

1999
01:46:51,588 --> 01:46:53,522
It's a limited
slip differential

2000
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:55,023
which distributes
Power equally

2001
01:46:55,091 --> 01:46:57,651
to both the right
and left tires.

2002
01:46:57,727 --> 01:47:00,719
The '64 Skylark had
a regular differential,

2003
01:47:00,797 --> 01:47:03,925
which anyone who's been
stuck in the mud knows,

2004
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,934
you step on the gas,

2005
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:08,300
one tire spins,
the other tire does nothing.

2006
01:47:08,371 --> 01:47:09,804
Is that it?

2007
01:47:09,873 --> 01:47:11,306
No. There's more.

2008
01:47:11,374 --> 01:47:14,468
See? The left tire mark
goes up on the curb

2009
01:47:14,544 --> 01:47:16,876
and the right tire mark
stays flat and even.

2010
01:47:16,946 --> 01:47:20,211
Well, the '64 Skylark
had a solid rear axle,

2011
01:47:20,283 --> 01:47:22,911
so when the left tire
went on the curb,

2012
01:47:22,986 --> 01:47:24,886
the right tire
would tilt out

2013
01:47:24,954 --> 01:47:26,546
and ride along its edge.

2014
01:47:26,623 --> 01:47:28,056
But that didn't happen.

2015
01:47:28,124 --> 01:47:30,718
The tire marks
stayed flat and even.

2016
01:47:30,794 --> 01:47:33,558
This car had an independent
rear suspension.

2017
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:37,566
In the sixties, there were two other
American-made cars

2018
01:47:37,634 --> 01:47:40,228
that had positraction
and independent rear suspension

2019
01:47:40,303 --> 01:47:42,737
and enough power
to make these marks.

2020
01:47:42,806 --> 01:47:44,239
One was the corvette

2021
01:47:44,307 --> 01:47:47,401
which could never be confused with
the Buick Skylark.

2022
01:47:47,477 --> 01:47:49,911
The other had
the same body length,

2023
01:47:49,979 --> 01:47:52,243
height, width,
weight, wheel base,

2024
01:47:52,315 --> 01:47:55,409
and wheel track
as the '64 Skylark,

2025
01:47:55,485 --> 01:47:58,921
and that was the 1963
Pontiac Tempest.

2026
01:47:58,988 --> 01:48:03,857
And because both cars
were made by GM,

2027
01:48:03,927 --> 01:48:05,360
Were both cars available

2028
01:48:05,428 --> 01:48:09,023
in metallic
mint-green paint?

2029
01:48:09,099 --> 01:48:10,327
They were.

2030
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,265
Thank you, Ms. Vito.

2031
01:48:12,335 --> 01:48:13,768
No more questions.

2032
01:48:13,837 --> 01:48:16,362
Thank you very,
very much.

2033
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:18,669
You've been a lovely..

2034
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:19,868
Lovely..

2035
01:48:19,943 --> 01:48:21,604
witness.

2036
01:48:32,455 --> 01:48:33,979
Uh, Mr. Trotter,

2037
01:48:34,057 --> 01:48:36,821
would you like
to question Ms. Vito?

2038
01:48:38,862 --> 01:48:40,989
Mr. Trotter?

2039
01:48:43,666 --> 01:48:45,065
Mr. Trotter!

2040
01:48:48,471 --> 01:48:49,733
Uh..

2041
01:48:49,806 --> 01:48:51,239
oh, uh, no.

2042
01:48:51,307 --> 01:48:54,242
No, no, Your Honor,
no further questions.

2043
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:56,244
In that case, Your Honor,

2044
01:48:56,312 --> 01:48:58,007
I'd like to recall
George Wilbur.

2045
01:48:59,916 --> 01:49:03,613
Ms. Vito, uh,
you can stand down.

2046
01:49:10,493 --> 01:49:13,428
You realize you're
still under oath?

2047
01:49:13,496 --> 01:49:14,690
Yes, sir.

2048
01:49:15,832 --> 01:49:17,197
Uh, Mr. Wilbur,

2049
01:49:17,267 --> 01:49:20,862
How did you like, uh,
Ms. Vito's testimony?

2050
01:49:20,937 --> 01:49:23,371
Very impressive.

2051
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,374
She's cute, too, huh?

2052
01:49:25,442 --> 01:49:26,875
Yes, very.

2053
01:49:27,944 --> 01:49:29,377
Mr. Gambini?

2054
01:49:29,446 --> 01:49:31,209
Sorry. Sorry, Your Honor.

2055
01:49:31,281 --> 01:49:32,976
Uh, Mr. Wilbur,

2056
01:49:33,049 --> 01:49:35,677
in your expert opinion,

2057
01:49:35,752 --> 01:49:40,451
would you say that everything
Ms. Vito said on the stand

2058
01:49:40,523 --> 01:49:42,252
was 100% accurate?

2059
01:49:44,127 --> 01:49:45,924
I'd have to say that.

2060
01:49:45,995 --> 01:49:48,225
Is there any way
in the world

2061
01:49:48,298 --> 01:49:51,233
the Buick that the defendants
were driving

2062
01:49:51,301 --> 01:49:53,201
made those tire tracks?

2063
01:49:56,306 --> 01:49:59,742
Come on. You could say.
It's OK. They know.

2064
01:50:01,277 --> 01:50:03,142
Actually..

2065
01:50:03,213 --> 01:50:04,237
no.

2066
01:50:04,314 --> 01:50:07,579
No. Thank you.
No more questions.

2067
01:50:10,987 --> 01:50:14,479
Your Honor,
I call Sheriff Farley.

2068
01:50:14,558 --> 01:50:18,494
You may stand down now,
Mr. Wilbur.

2069
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,935
Sheriff, you realize you're
still under oath?

2070
01:50:27,003 --> 01:50:27,935
Yes, sir.

2071
01:50:29,172 --> 01:50:30,605
Uh, Sheriff Farley,

2072
01:50:30,674 --> 01:50:32,107
um..

2073
01:50:32,175 --> 01:50:34,700
what did you find out?

2074
01:50:34,778 --> 01:50:37,611
On a hunch,
I took it upon myself

2075
01:50:37,681 --> 01:50:40,411
to see if there
was any information

2076
01:50:40,483 --> 01:50:43,247
on a '63 Pontiac Tempest

2077
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,948
stolen or abandoned recently.

2078
01:50:46,022 --> 01:50:48,388
This computer
readout confirms

2079
01:50:48,458 --> 01:50:51,393
that two boys who
fit the defendants' description

2080
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:53,395
were arrested
two days ago

2081
01:50:53,463 --> 01:50:55,954
by Sheriff Tilman in
Jasper County, Georgia,

2082
01:50:56,032 --> 01:51:01,436
for driving a stolen metallic mint-green
1963 Pontiac Tempest

2083
01:51:01,504 --> 01:51:03,438
with a white
convertible top

2084
01:51:03,506 --> 01:51:06,475
and Michelin model
XGV tires,

2085
01:51:06,543 --> 01:51:08,977
size 75-R-14.

2086
01:51:10,614 --> 01:51:12,445
Is that it?

2087
01:51:12,515 --> 01:51:13,709
No.

2088
01:51:15,285 --> 01:51:18,345
A.357 magnum revolver was found
in their possession.

2089
01:51:18,421 --> 01:51:19,445
- Oh!
- Oh!

2090
01:51:19,522 --> 01:51:21,046
Uh, Sheriff Farley,

2091
01:51:21,124 --> 01:51:23,490
just to refresh
the court's memory,

2092
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:27,621
what caliber bullet
was used to murder Jimmy Willis?

2093
01:51:27,697 --> 01:51:29,130
.357 magnum.

2094
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:31,997
The defense rests.

2095
01:51:37,707 --> 01:51:40,540
Mr. Trotter?

2096
01:51:48,485 --> 01:51:49,952
Your Honor..

2097
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:51,954
in light of Ms. Vito's

2098
01:51:52,022 --> 01:51:54,456
and Mr. Wilbur's testimony,

2099
01:51:54,524 --> 01:51:57,152
the state would like
to dismiss all charges.

2100
01:51:57,227 --> 01:51:58,387
Yes!

2101
01:51:58,461 --> 01:51:59,393
Aah!

2102
01:51:59,462 --> 01:52:00,394
All right!

2103
01:52:00,463 --> 01:52:01,395
Yeah!

2104
01:52:04,067 --> 01:52:05,796
Order in the court!

2105
01:52:05,869 --> 01:52:06,893
Yeah! Yeah!

2106
01:52:17,714 --> 01:52:19,875
Order here.

2107
01:52:33,263 --> 01:52:35,424
Have to get out
of here by 3:00.

2108
01:52:35,498 --> 01:52:38,433
Make sure the bags
are in the car.

2109
01:52:38,501 --> 01:52:41,265
I'm sorry to have
ever doubted you.

2110
01:52:41,338 --> 01:52:42,600
For this, I apologize.

2111
01:52:42,672 --> 01:52:43,934
Under the circumstances..

2112
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:44,939
you were great.

2113
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,942
I just wanted
to say thank you.

2114
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:47,942
You're welcome.

2115
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:50,445
I hope we can do it
again sometime.

2116
01:52:50,513 --> 01:52:51,707
Fine job,
Mr. Gambini.

2117
01:52:51,781 --> 01:52:52,713
Thanks.

2118
01:52:52,782 --> 01:52:54,579
Y'all come back
and see us.

2119
01:52:54,651 --> 01:52:56,084
I'll see you.

2120
01:52:56,152 --> 01:52:57,176
Vin.

2121
01:52:57,253 --> 01:52:58,379
Bill.

2122
01:52:59,522 --> 01:53:00,955
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

2123
01:53:01,024 --> 01:53:02,457
Vin, I..

2124
01:53:02,525 --> 01:53:03,617
Bill, listen.

2125
01:53:03,693 --> 01:53:06,457
Take your time.
Pick the right words.

2126
01:53:06,529 --> 01:53:09,464
Get back to New York.
Give me a call.

2127
01:53:09,532 --> 01:53:10,624
Thank you.

2128
01:53:11,768 --> 01:53:13,235
OK.

2129
01:53:13,303 --> 01:53:15,464
Vinny, you did
a terrific job.

2130
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:16,402
Thanks. Thanks.

2131
01:53:16,473 --> 01:53:17,906
You got an open invitation

2132
01:53:17,974 --> 01:53:20,408
anytime you want
to come down here.

2133
01:53:20,477 --> 01:53:22,911
We'll get us
a deer next time.

2134
01:53:22,979 --> 01:53:24,412
If I don't leave now,

2135
01:53:24,481 --> 01:53:27,416
I might never
be able to leave.

2136
01:53:27,484 --> 01:53:30,578
Mr. Gambini,
I have a fax here

2137
01:53:30,653 --> 01:53:32,917
from the clerk
of New York.

2138
01:53:34,491 --> 01:53:36,925
I owe you
an apology, sir.

2139
01:53:36,993 --> 01:53:39,427
I'm honored
to shake your hand.

2140
01:53:39,496 --> 01:53:41,930
"Win some, lose some."

2141
01:53:41,998 --> 01:53:43,260
Your courtroom manner

2142
01:53:43,333 --> 01:53:44,766
may be rather
unconventional,

2143
01:53:44,834 --> 01:53:46,927
but I got
to tell you,

2144
01:53:47,003 --> 01:53:49,938
you're one hell
of a trial lawyer.

2145
01:53:50,006 --> 01:53:51,439
Thank you, and, uh,

2146
01:53:51,508 --> 01:53:53,442
you're one hell
of a judge.

2147
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:54,442
Oh, sorry.

2148
01:53:57,747 --> 01:53:58,679
Bye, now.

2149
01:53:58,748 --> 01:53:59,680
Bye.

2150
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:00,681
Bye.

2151
01:54:06,222 --> 01:54:09,953
What the hell was that
all about back there?

2152
01:54:10,026 --> 01:54:13,723
I had a friend send
a fax to the judge

2153
01:54:13,797 --> 01:54:19,394
confirming the very impressive
legal stature of Jerry Callo.

2154
01:54:19,469 --> 01:54:22,905
What friends you got
in the Clerk's Office?

2155
01:54:22,972 --> 01:54:24,405
Your friend.

2156
01:54:24,474 --> 01:54:25,907
My friend?

2157
01:54:25,975 --> 01:54:27,465
Judge Malloy.

2158
01:54:29,612 --> 01:54:32,410
So what's your problem?

2159
01:54:32,482 --> 01:54:36,316
My problem is I wanted
to win my first case

2160
01:54:36,386 --> 01:54:38,149
without any help
from anybody.

2161
01:54:38,221 --> 01:54:40,655
Well, I guess
that plan's moot.

2162
01:54:40,723 --> 01:54:42,418
Yeah.

2163
01:54:42,492 --> 01:54:45,586
You know, this could be a sign
of things to come.

2164
01:54:45,662 --> 01:54:47,596
You win
all your cases,

2165
01:54:47,664 --> 01:54:49,598
but with somebody
else's help, right?

2166
01:54:49,666 --> 01:54:51,600
You win
case after case,

2167
01:54:51,668 --> 01:54:55,104
and then afterwards,
you have to go up to somebody,

2168
01:54:55,171 --> 01:54:57,605
and you have
to say thank you.

2169
01:54:57,674 --> 01:54:59,107
Oh, my God!

2170
01:54:59,175 --> 01:55:01,439
What a fucking nightmare!

2171
01:55:05,415 --> 01:55:07,440
I won my first case.

2172
01:55:07,517 --> 01:55:09,781
You know what this means.

2173
01:55:09,853 --> 01:55:11,616
You think I'll marry you.

2174
01:55:11,688 --> 01:55:14,452
What, you're not going
to marry me now?

2175
01:55:14,524 --> 01:55:17,550
No way. You can't win
a case by yourself.

2176
01:55:17,627 --> 01:55:18,958
You're fucking useless.

2177
01:55:21,464 --> 01:55:23,364
I thought we'd get
married this weekend.

2178
01:55:23,433 --> 01:55:25,663
You don't get it,
do you?

2179
01:55:25,735 --> 01:55:26,895
That is not romantic.

2180
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:29,131
I want a wedding
in church

2181
01:55:29,205 --> 01:55:30,900
with bridesmaids
and flowers.

2182
01:55:30,974 --> 01:55:31,307
Oh, how many times

2183
01:55:31,308 --> 01:55:32,399
Oh, how many times

2184
01:55:32,475 --> 01:55:35,410
did you say that spontaneous
is romantic?

2185
01:55:35,478 --> 01:55:37,412
Hey, a burp is spontaneous.

2186
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,414
A burp is not romantic.

2187
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:48,000
