1
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,970
Hurry! She collapsed 10 minutes ago.

2
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,810
The ambulance is on its way.

3
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,050
<i>Saint Theresa, dear God,</i>
<i>do not forsake me</i>...

4
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,570
<i>...give me strength. I want to live.</i>
<i>Restore me to life.</i>

5
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,450
Paris, Belleville, 1918

6
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,290
Why are you crying?
-Get the hell out of here, scum!

7
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,810
<i>I'm so lonely and miserable.</i>
<i>Life is so hard.</i>

8
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,730
<i>But it's all I know.</i>
<i>What more can I say?</i>

9
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,770
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,250
Why are you crying?
Are you on your own?

11
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,730
Where's your mother?

12
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,570
<i>Wherever I go,</i>
<i>in chains,</i>

13
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,450
<i>There is nothing but pain.</i>
<i>Nothing to accomplish.</i>

14
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:16,050
<i>My life is so hard.</i>
<i>I've known nothing else,</i>

15
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,770
<i>I'm all alone and miserable.</i>

16
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,690
A fine mother YOU are!
Hanging's too good for you!

17
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,570
I have to live too. I'm a singer!
-She should be looking after your daughter!

18
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,610
I look after her very well!

19
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,450
<i>Louis, I can no longer wait here for you.</i>
<i>Belleville is horrible.</i>

20
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,610
<i>My agent says that someone with my talent</i>
<i>should go to Constantinople...</i>

21
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,410
<i>...just like Frehel the singer...</i>

22
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,930
Good news for our acrobat?

23
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,210
Sure, and Clemenceau sends his regards.

24
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,650
<i>I left Edith with my mother.</i>

25
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,130
<i>She'll take care of her</i>
<i>till I'm on my feet again.</i>

26
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,970
<i>Louis, I can't wait for you any longer.</i>

27
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,570
<i>Anetta.</i>

28
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,970
Anybody home?

29
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,210
Edith?

30
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,610
Louis?

31
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,810
I'm taking her with me.

32
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,450
Bernay, Normandy, 1918

33
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,250
And who's this?

34
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,570
Your granddaughter: Edith.

35
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,490
That's a peculiar name.

36
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,090
She's a sickly looking child.

37
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,370
Come with me.

38
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,170
What are you doing here?

39
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,450
What a angel!
What's your name?

40
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,970
Back to work, Titine!
-There's someone in the toilet upstairs.

41
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,690
What lovely blue eyes you have.

42
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,410
I'm listening...

43
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,170
I have to be getting back.

44
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,050
I'll be demobbed soon.
Then I can work as an acrobat again.

45
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,690
I'll return for my little angel.
-Not now!

46
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,250
I'm finished, Mama Louise.
-Watch the door.

47
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,730
Where's her mother?

48
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,570
No idea.

49
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,650
Would you want her to stay here?

50
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,850
People will talk.
-People always talk.

51
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,690
Isn't she going with us to Mass?

52
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,890
We'll be late for Mass.
-The world doesn't revolve around her.

53
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,450
It appears we have a baby.
-May we see her?

54
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,610
It's a little girl. Would she like some bread?
-All right, everybody leave, please.

55
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,250
Come on, ask her if she'll sing for us.

56
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,410
A shame that communists aren't allowed on the stage.

57
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,730
<i>One night I went swimming</i>
<i>in my birthday suit,</i>

58
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,770
<i>Nobody could see me,</i>
<i>Only the night itself.</i>

59
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,410
<i>Until the moon suddenly appeared,</i>
<i>I felt like saying: shine on me.</i>

60
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,170
<i>Then I heard close by</i>

61
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,290
<i>A heartfelt cry.</i>

62
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,330
<i>A man stood on a rock,</i>
<i>Low enough to see me.</i>

63
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,450
<i>The man cried "Oh!"</i>

64
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,010
<i>And from the water,</i>
<i>I cried "oh" back.</i>

65
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,490
<i>He saw me naked,</i>

66
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:11,010
<i>Nothing to cover me,</i>
<i>I blushed the whole night long.</i>

67
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:17,050
<i>He saw me naked,</i>
<i>Completely naked.</i>

68
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:23,090
<i>Out of respect for the poor man,</i>
<i>I covered up my face.</i>

69
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,970
<i>But now I know</i>
<i>that by doing so</i>

70
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:35,730
<i>I ended up showing</i>
<i>my charms below.</i>

71
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,410
<i>He saw me naked.</i>

72
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,410
Titine! Open the door.
That's enough now.

73
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,290
What's the matter?
- She has Edith with her.

74
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,170
Open up I say!
-Whatever is the matter?

75
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,970
Nothing. Get a move on.
The customers will be here any minute.

76
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,330
Open the door! Otherwise I'll...
-I don't want to work.

77
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,010
I don't want to work.
-Oh, you don't want to work?

78
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:27,010
What do you think this is, a hotel?
-Edith is staying here with me tonight.

79
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,930
That's what YOU think.

80
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,970
It's me. Open this door.
The soldier is here.

81
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,730
<i>I couldn't care less.</i>
<i>That liar with his lies and alibis.</i>

82
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,530
<i>Stop your nonsense and get yourself out here.</i>
<i>Otherwise it's the street for you.</i>

83
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,810
I'm tired of you playing the drama queen!

84
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,490
I don't want any nonsense.

85
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,290
New York, May 8, 1959

86
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,770
Doug!

87
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,450
What, are you jealous?

88
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,810
I'll send the Billie Holiday records
to the hotel.

89
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,490
<i>Thank you, Loulou. Billie and I were born the same year.</i>
<i>Is that not something?</i>

90
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,970
I've brought my drawings.

91
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,930
You want to see them now, or later?

92
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,410
Later. First I have to sing that shmuck's song.

93
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,850
That's before your time...
-What?

94
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,810
Nothing.

95
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,810
I'm ready.

96
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,570
I'm ready.

97
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,010
That's Jeanne!

98
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,170
What's the matter?

99
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,970
Blood everywhere...
-Tell me about it!

100
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,930
<i>He wanted to play doctors and patients,</i>
<i>with my instruments.</i>

101
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,570
The filthy swine!

102
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,970
Titine!

103
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,850
We'll have to tell Madame.
-She'll kill me. It hurts!

104
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,850
I can't see anything.

105
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,010
Well, doctor?
-It's not good I'm afraid.

106
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,090
It's her cornea.

107
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,450
Is she blind?

108
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,210
It's an infection.

109
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,530
Patience. This sort of thing can last for months.

110
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,090
Take this to the pharmacist.

111
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,690
My thanks.

112
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,290
Whose child is she?

113
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,010
Nobody's.

114
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,170
Lisieux, Normandy

115
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,490
<i>Theresa, I never ask anything of you.</i>
<i>But I'm asking you to listen to little Edith.</i>

116
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,490
Please, Edith.
Say it. She's listening.

117
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,090
Theresa, I don't want to be blind.
I want to see.

118
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,690
She bumps into everything.
Go on.

119
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,730
<i>I want to learn how to read, and to run like I used to.
I don't want to be blind.</i>

120
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,810
Saint Theresa, please ask baby Jesus
to take care of Edith.

121
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,170
Go on.

122
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,570
Thank you, Saint Theresa, Jesus.
-Thank you.

123
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,290
She can see...

124
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,890
She can see!

125
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,570
Titine, get up!

126
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,210
What is it?
-He's back. He's come for Edith.

127
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,930
Get dressed.

128
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,130
They can't do this to me!

129
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,130
How can you keep on doing this?

130
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,050
She'll see a lot of the world.

131
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,210
Go!

132
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,450
Edith!

133
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,170
Titine!

134
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,530
Don't take my little girl away.

135
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,570
Let her go!

136
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,610
Enough!

137
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,410
She's crazy!

138
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,930
Stop or I'll throw you out!

139
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,210
You've no right!

140
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,410
Don't do this to me!
-Go!

141
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,770
It's over! I'm ending it all.

142
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,130
Here we are at Orly airport.
The passengers are disembarking...

143
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,810
...I see Edith Piaf!
With a young man in tow.

144
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,410
What have you brought back from America?
-An American.

145
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,250
What's his name?

146
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,650
Edith, for God's sake!

147
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,490
Just as in her song, she's carried
<i>'</i>by the crowd.<i>'</i>.

148
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,890
She's stepping into her amazing
black-and-white automobile.

149
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,210
She looks exhausted, but she's dazzling all the same.

150
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,970
Quiet, please! I wish to propose a toast ...

151
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,490
You're drunk!

152
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,650
You're one to talk!

153
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,090
Help the invalid.

154
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,330
Look out, accordion player, or I'll get you.

155
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,330
Perfect timing.

156
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,770
Get the manager.
I demand champagne on the house.

157
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,130
I'm Edith Piaf,
and I've made a mess of things.

158
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,970
Kiss one another! Even those who don't like each other!
<i>Kiss me, Claude.</i>

159
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,970
.

160
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,770
Who's that slapper?
-No idea.

161
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,330
The spicy beef tartare?
-Where's your handsome friend?

162
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,810
Don't embarrass her...
-Cool it. Who asked you?

163
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,090
Miss?

164
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,610
Miss Piaf, what an honour!
What can I do for you?

165
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,570
A lot. I'd like a present.
-But of course.

166
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,290
I wanted champagne, but I prefer a ring...

167
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,250
...a large ring studded with diamonds.

168
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,770
Don't bother. We'll have the champagne.

169
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,730
Here's to the love I feel for all of you...

170
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,690
...for which I stand. Help me up, someone.

171
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,610
A toast to Marguerite.

172
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,730
My composer and most loyal friend in the business.

173
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,890
Oh,don't blush so.You're making us weep.

174
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,890
What about a photograph?
-I don't think so.

175
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,410
Bubbles and alcohol, perfect!
That's Claude's doing.

176
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,610
<i>You're such a bore, Loulou.</i>
<i>We've just returned to Paris, and we're having fun.</i>

177
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,450
Stop playing the unhappy lover.

178
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,850
I'm waiting for someone.

179
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,370
Don't forget you've responsibilities.
There's more than you.

180
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,050
Remember the first night in Gerney
<i>'</i>s?

181
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,370
I looked like a bag lady.
You thought I was a princess.

182
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,450
You WERE a princess.
<i>My</i> princess!

183
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,770
To Marguerite.

184
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,330
To all those who wished
to see me come a cropper.

185
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,570
They think I don't know!
Cheers!

186
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,210
What's the matter, Louis?
-He's in bad form.

187
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,490
Go away. We're busy.

188
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,690
You're not here as decoration.
Get to work.

189
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,090
To work, you.
This is no child's play.

190
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,130
You'll earn your keep. Enough!

191
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,530
Stupid child!
You're in everyone's way!

192
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,250
Go to the trailer.
See to the meal.

193
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,170
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for Louis, the Human Snake!

194
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,850
What a little angel.

195
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,850
How old is she?
-Ten.

196
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,610
No mother?

197
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,210
What do you mean?

198
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,170
You be so lonely.

199
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,090
What about a calvados
in your trailer?

200
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,130
Let's go.

201
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,050
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

202
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,570
<i>I'm Theresa.</i>

203
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,250
<i>Are your eyes all right, sweetheart?</i>

204
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,450
Yes.

205
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,250
<i>You're so adorable.</i>
<i>Whom do wish to pray for?</i>

206
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,250
I want to pray for Titine.

207
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,290
<i>Very well. I shall look after you.</i>

208
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,850
<i>Never forget that.</i>

209
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,490
<i>Whenever you feel lonely,</i>
<i>remember I'm always here.</i>

210
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,810
Right, that's it!
You were supposed to change that wheel.

211
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,450
We're all in the same rotten boat!

212
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,090
I don't care!
-No? Then screw you!

213
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,210
You shouldn't let
that kind of thing get you down!

214
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,970
I can't stand Caroli!

215
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,290
You're drunk.
-I'm going solo.

216
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,210
Fat chance of that!
There aren't that many circuses.

217
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,090
I'll manage.

218
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,010
Just when I was getting used to you.
-You'll do okay without me!

219
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:13,530
Saint Theresa, please make him change his mind.
I don't want to leave the circus.

220
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,770
He's completely messed up.

221
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,490
Is the girl part of the act?

222
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,970
Hold on.
Do something.

223
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,090
Before they go, do something.

224
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,890
Come on, do something.

225
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,890
Bravo!

226
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,010
That's my daughter!

227
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,450
Grasse. October 1963

228
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,850
I'm sick of this carrot juice.
-You'll drink it as long as I'm nursing you.

229
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,450
I like it dark.
-The sun will do you good.

230
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,450
It's hard I know,
but you need a lot of rest...

231
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,130
...and patience.

232
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,050
Your husband phoned today...
-No point.

233
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:24,330
What bothers me
is that I exaggerated.

234
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,450
The past 3 years were awful.

235
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,330
You're a performer.

236
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,530
Simone?

237
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,290
I suppose I'll never sing again?

238
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,810
Paris, Montmartre.
October 1935

239
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,810
What's up with you?

240
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,850
I'm hungry.

241
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,050
First we sing, then we eat.

242
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,450
Sing alone and you're a beggar.
When you're a duo it's a show.

243
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,290
I want to sing here.

244
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,610
Hey, you!

245
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,490
No street singing allowed.

246
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,250
Is that a fact?

247
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,250
How old are you?
-Twenty.

248
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,010
What's that?

249
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,210
She's had hardly anything to drink.
-Come here.

250
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,970
Do you know <i>'</i>Du Gris<i>'</i>?

251
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,690
Oh, sir...
-Shut up!

252
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:30,170
If you sing that,I'll let you go.
That's my beat.I'll look the other way.

253
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,570
Next week it's our 21st.
Sisters for 5 years.

254
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,330
What do you prefer, working with me
or in the factory?

255
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,930
I'd rather cut my own throat.
How about you?

256
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,570
What do you mean?

257
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,970
Killing yourself in your little milk shop?
-Shut up! Not while we're eating.

258
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,930
Anetta, no moaning, okay?

259
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,690
Look, it's your drunken mother.

260
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,530
Edith?

261
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,650
Do you have any change?

262
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,090
That's all?
-I haven't much money.

263
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,810
Give me some bank notes.
-I don't have any.

264
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,890
I'm your mother.
-Go to hell!

265
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,690
Shall I sing a song?
-Throw her out!

266
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,050
I'm a performer. What about you?

267
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,410
You'll find out!

268
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,730
What'll I find out?
-When you're lying in the gutter.

269
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,130
Keep it down or leave!
-When you're in need...

270
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,610
Fuck off!

271
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,490
...don't depend on your daughter
giving you a bite to eat.

272
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,730
That's enough.
-I'm off. Have the rest if you want.

273
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,890
You're no singer, you slut!
-Leave her alone or you'll answer to me.

274
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,930
Oh, don't bother with that lot!

275
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,010
Fuck you!

276
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,530
Go and prostitute yourself on the street!

277
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,570
While you still can!

278
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,250
Thanks very much.

279
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:43,170
You'll ruin your voice doing that.
-I have to eat.

280
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,010
Of course you do.

281
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,210
I'm Louis Leplée.

282
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:52,850
Here's my card. Come round to Gerney<i>'</i>s,
tomorrow at two.

283
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,610
Are you a singer?
-No, but I have other talents.

284
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,570
Bring your music with you,
whatever you intend singing.

285
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,090
What if I don't come?

286
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,410
That's up to you, my girl.

287
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:34,010
This is all you have to show for a whole day?
This is how you reward my belief in you?

288
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,130
I've put a little aside for my father.
He's sick and he's broke.

289
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,730
I'm not a social worker.
-No really. He's sick.

290
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,610
If I toss you out on the street
maybe you'll get it.

291
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,690
Let her go!

292
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:52,330
Never! I'd rather starve than be a whore.

293
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,290
If you die, it's your own fault!
-Shut up!

294
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,930
I want MORE, is that clear?

295
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,210
Or you spread your legs, just like the rest.

296
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,850
You first.

297
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,690
Albert, I'm sorry...

298
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,810
Please stay!
-Leave the bastard.

299
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,210
Give her something to drink.

300
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,970
Are you coming to the Chinese?
-Who else is going?

301
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,330
The two Italians.

302
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:38,650
Plenty of snuff and tobacco.
And the warmth of another body...

303
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:44,730
Because we did it once,
doesn't mean I wish to do it again.

304
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,810
Don't start.
-Shall I explain?

305
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,170
I care not a jot for you,
and you want to know why?

306
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:56,410
No, I'm too stupid?
Because I'm an artist.

307
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:00,490
I'm going to the top. I know it.
I've always known it!

308
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,610
It's the Little Flower...

309
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,730
...Saint Theresa,
I foresee great things.

310
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,370
Seen her clothes?
She looks ill.

311
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,610
Where did he find her?

312
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,370
She's unbelievable.

313
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,810
Champagne.

314
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,530
The boss is crazy about her.
-What a voice!

315
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,890
She's really something, Louis.
-Spare me your jealousy, Josette.

316
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,930
What's your name again?
-Edith Giovanna Gassion.

317
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,050
Hmm, not very impressive.
-I have other names:

318
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,690
Huguette Helias, Tania...

319
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,370
...Denise Jay.

320
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,650
You've had a manicure!
-That wasn't the question.

321
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,010
You're just like a bird.
-You think so?

322
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,410
Really?

323
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,050
Is <i>'</i>Little Bird<i>'</i> taken?
-Yes, it's taken.

324
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,330
A sparrow...

325
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:59,210
Would you call a sparrow <i>'</i>piaf<i>'</i>?
Is that how you say it?

326
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,570
<i>The Little Sparrow</i>.
-Brilliant!

327
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,730
It's stupid.
-What would YOU know?

328
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,690
<i>The Little Sparrow.</i>
-Brilliant!

329
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,650
You'll need a suitable repertoire.
Bruants <i>'</i>Les Mômes de la Cloche<i>'</i>.

330
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:18,930
I know it.
-If necessary practise it all night.

331
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,490
We'll start you on Friday.

332
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,770
Show's beginning.

333
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,090
Take care of your protégée.
She's a slow starter.

334
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,770
I'm on my way.

335
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,410
Philippo, no more alcohol backstage.

336
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,730
What are you doing?
-I'd no time to finish it.

337
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,370
I'm knitting the sleeve.
-Now! We've a full house.

338
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,450
All the more reason!
She can't go on like that!

339
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,770
Look, our star is dressing the newcomer.

340
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,890
That's fine.
-Girls, let's go.

341
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,650
I have to throw up.
-Not now. Hurry up.

342
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,850
A day or two ago, on my way home,
Lady Luck led me...

343
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,930
...to the artist you'll see tonight.

344
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,490
Here she is, exactly as I first saw her,
an unpolished jewel:

345
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,650
From the street to Gerny<i>'</i>s:
<i>The Little Sparrow.</i>

346
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,610
She's like a sister to me.

347
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,930
Did I lie?
-She's extraordinary.

348
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:08,570
This is the great Jean Mermoz.

349
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,970
This is for you.

350
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,130
Thank you.

351
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,690
Come along, Edith.

352
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:18,890
You've won them over.
And you'll continue doing just that...

353
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,370
...I'm introducing you to someone
who can help your career along.

354
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,290
I'm Marguerite Monnot.
I'm a pianist.

355
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,650
If you need music,I'll gladly supply it.

356
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,250
Thank you.
-Come.

357
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:41,410
Edith, this is Mr. Jacques Canetti.
Artistic director of <i>Radio Cité.</i>

358
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,810
Miss, I was under your spell.
-Thank you.

359
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,930
Please, join us at our table.
-I can't. I have to go.

360
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,170
What can be so important?

361
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,170
Thank you.

362
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,290
What's the matter?

363
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,330
Wonderful, wonderful...

364
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:10,250
Get out right now or I'll...
-Hit him in the kisser!

365
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,170
I've waited an hour for you!

366
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:16,010
Go to hell, you bastard!

367
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,250
Stop it.

368
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:19,370
Miss, you're wonderful.

369
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:19,410
My hand's about to fall off.
More bubbles.

370
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:21,450
Give me the bottle.

371
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:27,170
I said you should listen to me. Radio is
a powerful medium, am I right, Coquatrix?

372
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:30,850
But don't underestimate the <i>Music Hall</i>.
-Of course not.

373
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,370
I've something for you.

374
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,290
A song?
-Of course.

375
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,450
Raymond!
Mireille, fetch Raymond !

376
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,530
Somebody here for you.

377
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,570
That big guy wants to see you.

378
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:57,410
This is Raymond Asso.
Writer, composer, poet.

379
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,530
I'll be right back.

380
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,050
I love your work.

381
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,370
I don't love your face.

382
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,570
I've seen you often.

383
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,290
I haven't seen you.

384
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,210
Midnight, everyone on their feet!

385
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,490
You're a big star.
-Yes, I wear high heels.

386
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,370
If you wish...
Call me. I'll be waiting.

387
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,810
Papa Leplée!

388
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,730
A toast to Papa Leplée,
my saviour.

389
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:24,530
Grasse. October 1963

390
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,970
He was a very discreet man...

391
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:30,810
Were you here yesterday?
-Yes, but I didn't see him.

392
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:34,850
So he was at home.
-Perhaps. Too bad.

393
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,770
He was discreet,
so lovely and attentive.

394
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:11,050
You bring bad luck!

395
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,050
It's her fault!

396
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,690
Are you the <i>Little Sparrow?</i>

397
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:32,130
Come with me, please.
-Why?

398
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,730
This way.

399
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,610
Let me through.

400
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:40,090
I'm talking to you.

401
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,810
Have you ties with the underworld?
-No.

402
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,210
Leave me alone.

403
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:51,810
And Henri Valette? And George, Johnny the
Sailor and Albert? Never heard of them?

404
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,930
Those are friends of mine.They've nothing to do with this

405
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:01,130
Being an accessory is a criminal offence.
-I'm innocent! I've done nothing.

406
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,410
I've lost everything.
-Where were you last night?

407
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,290
I told you: partying...

408
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,730
Bastards, swine!
This is disgusting!

409
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,970
We're not in the theatre now.

410
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,050
It seems you have a couple of nasty friends.

411
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:23,570
They're not like that.
-Sure, and I'm a cretin.

412
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,530
Have you an explanation?
-Not at this time.

413
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,770
It's a disgrace!

414
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:35,010
Go back to the gutter, slag!
-Leave her alone!

415
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,690
She didn't do it!
-Have you named names?

416
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,170
This is a funeral.
Have a little respect!

417
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,530
Just one more question.
-Vultures! Go away!

418
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:51,450
Out of the way!
Get the hell out of here!

419
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:56,290
It's over. I'm dead.
I've been dragged through the shit.

420
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,730
Forget it.

421
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,890
I haven't done anything!
-I know that.

422
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:06,770
Open up!

423
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,730
What?
-Simone Berteaut?

424
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,690
Yes.

425
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,170
Miss, please come with us.

426
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:24,970
Why?

427
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:30,290
Your mother has arranged with the court
for you to be placed in a boarding school.

428
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:35,250
Immediately.
Pack your things.

429
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:39,490
No! She's staying here.
-This has nothing to do with you.

430
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:43,210
For the last time: go and pack.

431
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:49,690
You want to see me dead!
That's it, isn't it?

432
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,090
Let me go!
-She's staying here. Momone!

433
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,370
Edith, don't let them!

434
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:02,810
My things! I don't have any things!
Do you hear that, you shit?

435
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,970
Momone, no!

436
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,530
Papa Leplée...

437
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,410
Oh, Papa Leplée...

438
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,290
You killed him.
Where's the money?

439
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,490
What can you expect from
a former whore?

440
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:24,170
Everybody out of the dressing room!
Mamy, you stay.

441
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,570
I need a shot for the pain.

442
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,970
Get the American.

443
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:07,650
You can come in now.

444
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,690
A triumph. You were magnificent.
-Doug?

445
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:23,410
I need fresh air.
I'm going back with you to Chálons.

446
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:28,570
But that's 400 kilometres away.

447
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:33,650
You can go to hell!
I'm sick of you all!

448
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:36,770
You're exhausted.
It's a long journey.

449
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:40,250
No, no, always no!
Drop dead!

450
00:58:58,530 --> 00:58:59,970
Let's go back.

451
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,610
Turn around!

452
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,570
You've ruined it for me!
-What's this...

453
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,370
<i>The blood test is a catastrophe.</i>

454
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:25,490
She has two broken ribs we're unable to set.
This is going to take weeks.

455
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,770
<i>I'd cancel all engagements.</i>

456
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,290
It's tight enough. Please leave.

457
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,850
Doctor, give me an injection so I can sing.

458
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:47,050
My admiration knows no bounds.

459
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:50,370
That may be, but I have none.

460
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:53,250
Cancel the concert.
You're risking your life.

461
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:56,650
What's life without risk?

462
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,930
What would you say to a new life?
Change your surroundings.

463
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,450
My what?
-Your surroundings.

464
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,650
Why didn't you call me sooner?

465
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:09,450
I was busy. I didn't know
what you wanted of me.

466
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:12,970
I saw you sing.
You have much to learn.

467
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,810
No one's ever said that before.

468
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:20,290
In three months' time you won't be that<i>'girl'</i>any more.
Your bar days are over.

469
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,810
<i>He had clear blue eyes</i>
<i>That flashed like lightning</i>

470
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,490
<i>in a storm in the night</i>

471
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:30,170
In-a-storm-in-the-night!
Articulation!

472
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:32,050
Again!

473
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,490
<i>He had clear blue eyes</i>

474
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,650
Are those words or noises?

475
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,370
What do want of me?
-Perfect diction!

476
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:46,730
I sing as I speak.
-Badly.

477
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:51,130
You shout the words
and they lose their meaning.

478
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:54,650
More slowly, Marguerite.

479
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,890
We've been at it six hours.
Can someone open a window?

480
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,010
We'll be doing breathing shortly.

481
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:00,970
From the top.

482
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:08,850
<i>He had clear blue eyes, that flashed </i>
<i>like lightning. In a storm...</i>

483
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,730
You're not paying attention!
You're not creating.

484
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:16,290
You must <i>become</i> the woman in love.

485
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,930
Think as an actress.

486
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:23,770
He's making fun of me.

487
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:26,610
We're all tired. We'll take a break.

488
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,210
He makes me feel as if I can't sing.

489
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,410
Who do you think you are?

490
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,690
Don't be satisfied with half measures.

491
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,610
I've been singing since I was nine years old.

492
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:43,530
Take it easy.
This is new and difficult.

493
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:48,330
You're interpreting something, understand?
You must LIVE the song!

494
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,770
No one's ever had a problem
with my diction before.

495
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:54,690
No one... like whom?

496
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:58,010
The riff-raff in Gerny<i>'</i>s?
Or on the street?

497
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,370
Do what I say or go back to the gutter.

498
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,090
Edith!

499
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:27,330
Here's to my girl who never forgets her vader.

500
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,290
To my little one!

501
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:32,290
Your mentor, is he rich?

502
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,890
Not a cent... He does it
for the love of art.

503
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,730
For the love of your arse you mean!

504
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:42,130
Come on, little one, sing.
-Sing for us!

505
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,330
That's the way to treat her.

506
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:36,810
I let her have her own way.

507
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,570
I was too good to her!

508
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,250
You're too stiff.

509
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:12,490
Like a bare-knuckle fighter.
Performing is an art.

510
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,810
You have to grab the audience.

511
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:19,650
You have lovely hands.
Use them.

512
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,290
Sing with them.

513
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,970
Again, Marguerite.

514
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,970
Move them.

515
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,250
The hands!

516
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,290
That's it.

517
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,450
I look stupid.
-Continue.

518
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,890
Put this on.

519
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,290
That's not what people want.
It's my voice they wish to hear.

520
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:01,050
How can you be so talented
and at the same time so dense?

521
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,930
Open the door.
-I have to throw up!

522
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:32,170
Is she drunk?
-She's in panic.

523
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:36,050
The audience is waiting.

524
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:41,250
For weeks you've been pestering me for this gig.

525
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:44,850
For God's sake take the stage
before the tear the place apart.

526
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:46,490
She's on her way.

527
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:50,650
Edith?
Three minutes.

528
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:56,450
This isn't a bar, it's a theatre.
What am I doing here?

529
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,690
Stage fright.
It's a good sign.

530
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:07,170
Edith?

531
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,410
What?

532
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:14,730
This is it.
This is what we worked hard for.

533
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,890
You can't back down now.

534
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:20,770
Open the door.

535
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,170
No, I can't do it.

536
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,130
Please, open the door.

537
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,170
On your feet.

538
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:18,930
Ladies and gentlemen, Edith Piaf!

539
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:30,090
<i>...Edith Piaf Triumphs</i>...
<i>...Fame for Street Singer...</i>

540
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,690
<i>...The Little Sparrow Premieres...</i>

541
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,210
<i>...The first man</i>
<i>Who Helped Me...</i>

542
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,050
<i>...Piaf On Tour...</i>

543
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:48,690
<i>...Edith Piaf's Appearance</i>
<i>in the A.B.C. Theatre...</i>

544
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:07,410
<i>The Little Sparrow is Dead</i>
<i>Long Live Edith Piaf!</i>

545
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:26,370
<i>"I was hurrying home,</i>
<i>needing your love to lean on,</i>

546
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:32,410
<i>...only to find an empty room.</i>
<i>Waiting and waiting; I know that room."</i>

547
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:36,770
I can't wait to see you in this piece.
Look out, here comes Canetti.

548
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:41,010
The conductor's been waiting three hours.
-So?

549
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,570
The premiere is less than 48 hours away.

550
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:47,130
Do you know many people whom
Cocteau's written a piece for?

551
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,690
Miss?
-Yes, Suzanne?

552
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:53,690
Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr. Cocteau at eight.

553
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,290
You see?

554
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:58,890
Ask him to come back at midnight.
-Are you sure?

555
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:02,650
You're worse than Raymond.
Do this, do that.

556
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:05,930
That's why you fired him.
-Stop it.

557
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:09,370
Do you wish to see the gowns?
-Yes, the gowns.

558
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:21,290
That's all of them.
Careful with those pins.

559
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:24,010
The simplest one, without the collar.

560
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,370
There's a man at the door...
He has something for you.

561
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,330
Who is it?
-A soldier.

562
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:36,930
I told him you were busy.
He's outside in the corridor.A bit embarrassed.

563
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,250
Have him come in.

564
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,530
Will you come this way?

565
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:59,210
Here she is.
-Much better without the collar.

566
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:01,490
Yes?

567
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,730
My name is Michel Emer.
I'm a corporal.

568
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,690
This isn't the army.
What do you want?

569
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:12,610
I have a song for you.

570
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:17,450
Not another... I've enough already.
I have a premiere in two days' time.

571
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:19,010
I wish this one.

572
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,410
Tomorrow I leave for the front.

573
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:27,690
There's the piano.
You have five minutes.

574
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:33,570
Edith...

575
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,170
We shall have to wait.

576
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,770
Stop.

577
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,210
I want it.

578
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,050
Everybody out.

579
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,530
You can't mean that.
We're already late.

580
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,330
What can't she mean?

581
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,050
Play it.
I want it for Bobino.

582
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:35,210
You can't do that.

583
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:39,250
Edith Piaf can do whatever she pleases!

584
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,090
French, please.

585
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:53,010
She's too hopeless, too poor...
-Help us out here, Charles.

586
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:55,090
I'm no translator.

587
01:13:55,490 --> 01:14:01,050
<i>'</i>Miserable. And not in the French
tradition of the <i>Can-Can</i> and <i>Gay Paris.'</i>

588
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:02,610
A complete flop.

589
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:06,210
This isn't the first time I've had to fight.

590
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:09,130
The Americans want pretty girls, not me.

591
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:12,810
I'm not the Parisian sex bomb
you were hoping for.

592
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:17,690
Can you picture me in a ballet?
With a feather in my arse?

593
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:27,330
Go ahead and laugh.
I'm not what they want.

594
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:30,810
They think I'm too doleful, THEY are stupid.
-Yes, too stupid.

595
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:34,490
.

596
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,290
.

597
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,210
You made the front page.
-Two columns.

598
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,650
.

599
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:47,970
.

600
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:50,930
.

601
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:00,210
I can't read it.
Translate it.

602
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:05,610
He says that she shouldn't let you go.
That it would be a mistake.

603
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,330
The Americans don't deserve you.

604
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:12,410
I knew something would happen!
I have to change...

605
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:15,010
...Ginou, help me help me choose a dress.

606
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:19,650
I'm going out tonight. I have a date.

607
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,890
.

608
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:36,490
What's this, Marcel?
-Beef...try it.

609
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:41,290
It smells like damp dog.

610
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,930
.

611
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:45,890
What?

612
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:49,170
.

613
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:50,730
.

614
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,930
Your English is as good as the meat.

615
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:03,450
Don't you like it here?

616
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,850
I was taken a bit by surprise.
I didn't expect it...

617
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:15,010
...when you phoned to say that as two French people
in New York we should have a meal...

618
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:19,490
...I didn't expect this.
-I come here all the time.

619
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:26,530
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

620
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:42,650
Have you decided?
-Twee broodjes pastrami.

621
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:50,730
I'll handle this: two Tournedos Rossini,
and a bottle of Chateau Langelus 1938.

622
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:59,330
Are you hungry?
-It's better than cooked dog.

623
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,770
I'm sorry.

624
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,090
Let's start over. Okay?

625
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:10,930
How long have you been in New York?
-Eight weeks.

626
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:15,690
And do you like America?
-It doesn't interest me at all.

627
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:18,050
I don't understand them,
and they don't understand me.

628
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,690
You must miss Paris.
-Terribly.

629
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:23,370
What do you do when you're not singing?

630
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:29,290
Your like the police with your questions.
I knit.

631
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:33,530
Give me your size and
I'll knit you a sweater.

632
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,170
No, but thanks all the same...

633
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:40,290
Those people recognized you.
-Really?

634
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:47,730
They said: <i>'</i>That schmuck lost his
recent fights. He's washed up.<i>'</i>

635
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:50,490
I'll show them who's washed up.
-No!

636
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:54,090
Relax. I was joking.

637
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,330
It's fine.

638
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,530
Can we be less formal to each other?
-Of course.

639
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:25,210
What do you do when you aren't boxing?
-I train and I run...

640
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:29,890
And after the training?
-ln Morocco I work on my farm.

641
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:32,330
You have a farm?

642
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,690
I breed pigs.

643
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,050
Well, why not?

644
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:46,130
Absolutely. Why not?

645
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:49,410
It's a fine farm: modern, with superb, fat pigs.

646
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:52,610
Who takes care of them when you're boxing?
-My wife.

647
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,170
You have...

648
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,730
...wonderful hands.

649
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:10,970
Did you hear what I said, Momone?
-You have really beautiful fingers.

650
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:14,210
Listen.

651
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:16,370
What colour are your eyes?

652
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:20,930
He leaned over...
-And his breath smelled.

653
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:24,290
You can be such a bitch!
-He is of course a pig breeder.

654
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:27,170
He said...
-Violet blue.

655
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:29,170
Of course, violet blue.

656
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:33,530
It was the way he said it.
As though he was a child.

657
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:38,690
Then he said:
-You're just like a fairy.

658
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:42,010
A bit of an exaggeration.

659
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:13,410
Did you kiss him?
-I didn't dare.

660
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:17,690
It was a wonderful evening.
-Too short.

661
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:24,050
Will you come and see me box?
-Of course.

662
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:28,570
Did he try to kiss you?

663
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:31,210
I don't know if he even thought about it.

664
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,450
And I'm supposed to believe that!

665
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:35,730
I'll come to see you sing.

666
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:41,290
Goodnight.

667
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,730
He's the love of my life...

668
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,050
You were superb.

669
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:23,090
Mr. Lucien Roupp,
Mr. Cerdan's manager.

670
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:26,930
Mr. Jameson,
of CBS television.

671
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:30,010
.

672
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:42,850
Marlene.

673
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:50,050
Good evening. I'm sorry,
I just wanted to say something.

674
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:55,210
I haven't been in Paris in years.

675
01:22:55,490 --> 01:23:00,650
But this evening,when you sang
I was right back there again..

676
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:03,610
...on her streets, beneath her skies.

677
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:07,250
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

678
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:11,770
You took me with you on your travels.
You brought tears to my eyes.

679
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:17,290
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
-Thank you.

680
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:55,690
Come on.

681
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:06,610
I'm beginning to like this city.
The stars are out tonight.

682
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,930
Let's go.

683
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:27,410
Marc, do you know how long
a frog lives for?

684
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:30,450
In fairytales or in real life?

685
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:36,490
No one ever read me fairytales.

686
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:39,490
You never had the chance to hear them.

687
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:43,730
That's true, but all the same...

688
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:33,650
Dreux. 13 December 1959

689
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:14,570
I'm a little tired.

690
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:17,690
I'll be right back.

691
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,770
Lay her down there.

692
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:48,970
I'll go back on in a minute.
-Out of the question.

693
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:51,050
Nobody tells ME when to stop.

694
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:55,210
What are we going to do?
-Sorry, you'll have to clear the house.

695
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:58,010
I'm going back there!
-No, Edith.

696
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,690
I have to continue.
-It would be suicide.

697
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:02,170
You're going to hospital.

698
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:06,930
No, I'm begging you!

699
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:11,770
She left hospital only three weeks ago.
There'll be more galas.

700
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:15,570
Take me back to the stage.

701
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:18,530
I have to sing.

702
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:21,650
I have to sing, Louis.
I have no choice.

703
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:25,170
Edith, please...

704
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:28,450
Can't you hear them?
-Stop...

705
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:30,970
Shut that door!

706
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:33,050
Take me back there, Louis.

707
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:37,170
If I don't sing tonight...

708
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:44,450
If I don't sing one song at least,
I'll lose faith in myself. Do you follow?

709
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:00,250
Doctor...

710
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,690
...do what you have to do.

711
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:31,930
Not this time, boys.

712
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:35,570
You think I'm going to collapse,
but I'm in great shape.

713
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:38,530
Don't you dare write that this is my suicide tour!

714
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,050
<i>'Padam'!</i>

715
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:15,210
<i>Saint Theresa,</i>
<i>first of all my thanks...</i>

716
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:20,770
<i>I know you're behind it all.</i>
<i>You sent him to me.</i>

717
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:25,410
<i>I've found love,</i>
<i>thanks to you.</i>

718
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:29,690
<i>Baby Jesus,</i>
<i>protect Marcel.</i>

719
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:44,050
Come on, Marcel!

720
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:47,370
No!

721
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:50,890
It's too early, Edith.
-He's going to win. I feel it.

722
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:53,570
If things go wrong, you've a problem.
-What do you mean?

723
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:58,890
If there's no problem,
I'll call you. Now go.

724
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,130
Hurry up!

725
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,090
Come on, Marcel!

726
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:47,130
One more round!

727
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:03,010
Come on, Marcel!

728
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,050
Finish him off!

729
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:48,450
What's happening?
-Zale is sitting it out.

730
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:18,130
Did he do it?
Is he the world champion?

731
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:19,690
You look like an angel.

732
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:23,610
Not a fairy any more?

733
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:32,010
You're my champion.

734
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:34,610
I want to be with you always.

735
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:38,490
There was nothing before I met you.
All that is in the past.

736
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:44,530
Stay with me.

737
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:52,890
<i>My dearest, before going to bed last night</i>
<i>I crossed off a day...</i>

738
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:56,130
<i>...a day that was long and short.</i>

739
01:35:56,330 --> 01:36:02,010
<i>Such pain, that plane flew away with my heart.
My life, my breath...</i>

740
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:05,370
<i>...my sweet boy,</i>
<i>my child, my dearest love...</i>

741
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:10,210
<i>...your scent is still on my sheets,</i>
<i>and my heart sleeps without waking...</i>

742
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:12,570
<i>...in the arms of sadness.

743
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:17,170
<i>Darling, I love you.</i>
<i>What have you done to me?</i>

744
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:18,410
<i>I miss you.</i>

745
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:22,890
<i>I'm depressed, lifeless,</i>
<i>as though I'm waiting for something...</i>

746
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:30,570
<i>...hold me close against your heart and
know that nothing means more to me than you.</i>

747
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:35,530
<i>Bring me back my heart.</i>

748
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:39,290
<i>Whenever I'm in a restaurant and
hear 'La Vie en Rose'...</i>

749
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:45,890
<i>If I see, my love, how devoted you are
to your wife and children...</i>

750
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:47,970
<i>...I have the urge to go far away...</i>

751
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:52,490
<i>...and perhaps one day you'll be
grateful for what I've done.</i>

752
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:56,930
<i>I can't have you to myself
and I can't live without you.</i>

753
01:36:57,130 --> 01:37:00,730
<i>As God is my witness,I ask nothing for myself...</i>

754
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:03,450
<i>...and am prepared to sacrifice everything.</i>

755
01:37:05,290 --> 01:37:08,250
<i>'If life were to take you from me...</i>

756
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:12,770
<i>...if you should die or be far away,</i>
<i>and you were to love me, I too would die.'</i>

757
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:21,250
In three months' time,
wait for it, in April...

758
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:26,050
...I'm going to star in <i>L'Olympia.</i>
Full house and then we're back again.

759
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:30,050
Your liver is damaged...

760
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:33,250
...you've been ill and need rest.
It's serious this time.

761
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:35,970
I'm only 44.
I'm not dead yet.

762
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:39,170
Because of all the cancellations
we're broke.

763
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:41,450
Oh, so it's my fault?

764
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:45,010
I didn't say that.
The taxman is breathing down our necks.

765
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:48,210
We have to pay 120.000 <i>franc</i>.

766
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:53,650
I only have jaundice! That won't last
100 years. Don't exaggerate.

767
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:57,130
I want to sing in <i>L'Olympia</i>.

768
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:07,810
Anything else?
-We shouldn't give in all the time.

769
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:12,610
I can't watch her all the time.
She discharged herself too soon from hospital.

770
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:16,690
<i>L'Olympia</i> is in 3 months.
That's going to be a disaster.

771
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:20,570
She needs this sort of challenge.
-This is hopeless.

772
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:24,410
In that case I'll have to tell the insurers
that we're cancelling everything.

773
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:28,330
We have to make the decisions for her.
Whether she likes it or not.

774
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:23,690
I said to myself,
<i>'</i>Edith, it's over.<i>'</i>

775
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:27,090
There's someone else. You've lost him.
-Did he have an affair?

776
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:30,170
I he did have, would I be telling you?

777
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:32,970
He left the restaurant.
I followed him.

778
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:38,250
My Marcel walked the whole of New York
to eat with an old blind boxer...

779
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:42,850
...whom he'd met a couple of years before.
Can you imagine that?

780
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:49,370
Men like that are scarce.
-My Marcel...

781
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:53,010
...that's all you ever talk about.
That's the only thing that counts.

782
01:39:56,570 --> 01:40:00,850
But listen, Ginou,
I'll never have him.

783
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:05,330
He'll never be mine.
He'll remain with his wife and children.

784
01:40:10,690 --> 01:40:13,010
He phones her every day.

785
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:18,330
I pretend I don't know what's going on.
I want him to be happy.

786
01:40:20,690 --> 01:40:21,970
I'll be right back.

787
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:29,130
<i>I</i> could have been Edith Piaf.

788
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:32,210
There's more in life than chansons.

789
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:47,130
It's been too long, Marcel!
Call <i>Orly.</i> Book a flight this evening.

790
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:52,170
SUCH a long ocean sailing:
I'd never survive it.I miss you, Marcel.

791
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:55,130
I can't bear to be apart from you.

792
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:59,650
Perhaps I have to return to Paris.
-Hold on.

793
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:03,610
I'm no more than Madame's lapdog.
-Stop it...

794
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:10,690
Rum, coke! Whisky!
People think I'm rubbish.

795
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,690
Getting drunk in Belleville was better.

796
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:18,610
You abandoned me.

797
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:20,690
That's enough, Momone!

798
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:24,690
Take her away from here.

799
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:31,130
I'm taking the boat.

800
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:33,970
To your career, Edith!

801
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,370
Marcel, leave tonight. For me.

802
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:37,050
You won't be sleeping if I'm not there.
-Thank God for that, Marcel.

803
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:50,250
I'll make you coffee.
You stay where you are.

804
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:58,530
Let me serve you.

805
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:17,010
What are you doing here?

806
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,130
I knew you'd come.

807
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:41,370
Lucien found it hard to get tickets.

808
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:48,290
I've a gift for you.

809
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:55,410
You don't look too well.
You could do with some sun. You're pale.

810
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:05,610
Ginou!

811
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:09,170
I'm looking for that watch!

812
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:18,730
Wat nou?
I'm looking for that watch!

813
01:44:18,930 --> 01:44:22,970
In the red Cartier box.
Shit, it was right here!

814
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:33,170
What's the matter with you?

815
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:37,170
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

816
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:45,970
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
What?

817
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:51,010
Louis? What's the matter?

818
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,370
I want you to be brave, Edith.

819
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:58,770
Is it Marcel?

820
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,570
What?

821
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:06,250
The plane crashed...

822
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:25,650
Marcel!

823
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:30,210
Marcel!

824
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:04,490
What more can I tell you?

825
01:47:05,530 --> 01:47:07,250
They say you're the best clairvoyant there is.

826
01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:12,250
This is your third visit this week.
I've told you all I know.

827
01:47:12,610 --> 01:47:14,370
Why do you keep coming back?

828
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:18,570
So you can tell me again.

829
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:22,970
So that I know why I should continue living.

830
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:27,450
He died in the air, so that is where he must be...

831
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:41,650
<i>California, August 1955</i>

832
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:54,730
Jack Peals! Can we go any faster?
I need air.

833
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:57,410
I love the heat.
It makes me dizzy.

834
01:47:58,290 --> 01:48:00,810
Step on it.
Our pin-up is melting!

835
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:07,450
I'm getting a sore throat.
Then you can take care of me.Like a good husband.

836
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:11,250
The best I've had.
-The FIRST you've had!

837
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:15,290
Are you going to spend the day gawping at up?

838
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:20,290
I'm feeling nauseous.

839
01:48:20,730 --> 01:48:23,610
Look out, you'll drive us off the road.

840
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:29,850
Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive.
Then Ginou can throw up.

841
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:36,050
Go on, Ginou.

842
01:48:37,490 --> 01:48:39,010
May I, Madame?

843
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:42,650
Go ahead, Ginou!

844
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:45,450
Very good!

845
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:52,330
Bye bye, Ginou!

846
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:54,890
Wait for me!

847
01:48:58,730 --> 01:49:00,210
My, you're some driver.

848
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:08,090
Our journey hasn't been wasted after all.
We just murdered a tree.

849
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:20,610
My God, the service here is awful.
Can nobody take our order?

850
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:26,530
Take it easy. You're no star here.
<i>Mocambo</i> is tonight.

851
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:30,490
Remind me who invited us.

852
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:34,450
Marlon Brando, Ginger Rogers,
Mr. Chaplin...

853
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:39,770
What's this?

854
01:49:41,410 --> 01:49:45,330
We didn't order that swill!
-That's your cocktail.

855
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:57,490
Don't touch me!
I said don't touch me!

856
01:49:58,050 --> 01:49:59,810
Here, wipe it off.

857
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:04,330
We should get a divorce.

858
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:12,370
How many times a day are you shooting up now?

859
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:14,890
About ten.

860
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:21,610
Excuse me for being so direct,
but why do you do it?

861
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:26,850
So that my body doesn't protest.

862
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:34,410
When did you start injecting every day?

863
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:37,810
Five years ago, after the plane crash.

864
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:42,450
I contracted rheumatism.
I couldn't knit any more.

865
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:47,170
You're very dependent on it.

866
01:50:48,090 --> 01:50:50,930
It's an addiction...
-Doctor?

867
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:53,970
I want my wife to kick the habit.

868
01:50:56,810 --> 01:51:00,010
I want to be well again. I can do it.

869
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:09,090
October 1960 - 5 years later

870
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:31,330
Danielle, a chair!

871
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:41,890
Edith?

872
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:50,330
Here you are.

873
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:52,610
Sit down now.

874
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:04,130
Bruno...

875
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:11,970
...there won't be another
<i>L'Olympia</i>.

876
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:19,930
I understand.

877
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:32,650
No!

878
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:45,690
The composer Charles Dumont and
the lyricist Michel Vaucaire are here.

879
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:49,010
They wish us to hear their <i>chanson</i>.

880
01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:59,050
Quickly then. I'm tired.

881
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:20,570
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

882
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:25,450
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

883
01:53:26,490 --> 01:53:30,890
<i>not the good times I had</i>

884
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:35,170
<i>not the pain</i>
<i>it means nothing to me</i>

885
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:36,690
Stop!

886
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:41,290
I love it. Carry on!

887
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:44,730
<i>with my souvenirs</i>

888
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:47,810

<i>my sadness, my pleasure</i>

01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:52,530
<i>I don't need it any longer</i>

891
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:55,210
<i>the loves are gone</i>

892
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:57,690
<i>the traumas as well</i>

893
01:53:57,890 --> 01:54:00,450

01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:03,810
You're wonderful!

896
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:08,130
That's precisely what I was looking out for.
Unbelievable. This is so ME!

897
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:11,090
That is MY life.
That is me!

898
01:54:11,410 --> 01:54:16,450
Call Coquatrix. <i>L'Olympia</i> is on!
Play it again. It's exquisite.

899
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:20,610
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

900
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:25,370
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:48,170
<i>You're doing well, my dear.</i>
Your friend, Marguerite<i>'</i>

902
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:52,930
Everyone's here: Aznavour,
Mr. Cocteau, Yves Montand.

903
01:54:53,130 --> 01:54:56,130
Montand's here?
I read that he wasn't coming.

904
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:57,490
He's come for you!

905
01:54:57,690 --> 01:55:01,730
They've been waiting a half hour.
-The room is jumping.

906
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:14,930
Not too tight?

907
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:20,290
Who's that?
-A friend.

908
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:43,010
Let's go, Edith.

909
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:44,490
Up you get.

910
01:55:50,050 --> 01:55:51,370
My crucifix?

911
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:54,130
My crucifix...

912
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:57,810
My crucifix?

913
01:55:58,010 --> 01:56:01,010
I forgot. I'll fetch it.
-I won't sing without it.

914
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:04,650
Everybody out!

915
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:16,850
<i>Grasse, Oktober 1963</i>
<i>The Final Night</i>

916
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:18,490
See you tomorrow.

917
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:20,250
I'll do it.

918
01:57:25,530 --> 01:57:30,930
I'm afraid, Simone. I'm losing my memory.
It's serious this time.

919
01:57:32,330 --> 01:57:34,730
My brain is confused.

920
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:40,490
I try to remember things but they won't come.

921
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:46,170
Things do come, but not the things I want.

922
01:57:48,930 --> 01:57:53,050
I wanted to see his watch.
Don't you remember? Marcel's watch?

923
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:58,130
I'm afraid not. I never knew him.
-I wanted to see his watch...

924
01:58:16,050 --> 01:58:17,730
What a face!

925
01:58:19,410 --> 01:58:21,210
You have wild eyes.

926
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:26,250
I like the little one.

927
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:02,570
Simone?
-Yes, Edith?

928
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:07,050
I haven't said my prayers.

929
01:59:10,050 --> 01:59:12,810
I must get down on my knees and pray.

930
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:17,450
No one will think less of you
if you don't get down on your knees.

931
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:20,490
I wish to pray for my papa.

932
02:00:21,050 --> 02:00:22,370
Marcelle...

933
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:25,130
Marcelle...

934
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:28,050
...my little ghost...

935
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:34,650
Only Momone knows.
I must tell you about my ghost.

936
02:00:34,850 --> 02:00:37,610
Take it easy, Edith.
-Marcelle!

937
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:49,650
Marcelle, go to bed. Enough for today.

938
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:55,650
And I'm supposed to look out for the police
- and your child! What Louis up to?

939
02:00:57,010 --> 02:00:58,490
It's your father.

940
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:04,410
Has she eaten?

941
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:08,370
They're saying you were on the street with her.
-Who says that?

942
02:01:08,570 --> 02:01:11,690
You only have her twice a month
and you can't even do THAT right!

943
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:13,450
I told you: not on the street!

944
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:23,690
Come quick.

945
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:27,290
It's Marcelle!
Come quick!

946
02:01:31,890 --> 02:01:33,410
She's in the hospital!

947
02:01:55,170 --> 02:01:57,050
Are you her mother?

948
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:02,370
Meningitis. We could do nothing. I'm sorry.

949
02:02:35,530 --> 02:02:36,970
Edith?

950
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:40,210
I have the crucifix.

951
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:00,610
They told me you were on the beach.

952
02:03:01,490 --> 02:03:05,530
Thanks for agreeing to this interview.
-My pleasure.

953
02:03:06,610 --> 02:03:09,050
How strange to meet you so far from Paris.

954
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:11,650
I'm never far from Paris.

955
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:17,570
I have a list of question.
Just say the first thing that occurs to you.

956
02:03:23,650 --> 02:03:27,090
What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.

957
02:03:27,290 --> 02:03:31,130
Your favourite food?
-Roast beef.

958
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:37,770
Would you like to live sensibly?
-I already do.

959
02:03:41,850 --> 02:03:46,610
<i>Who are your most loyal friends?</i>
-<i>All my genuine friends.</i>

960
02:03:48,810 --> 02:03:51,450
<i>If you were unable to sing...</i>

961
02:03:52,130 --> 02:03:55,410
<i>Then I could no longer live.</i>

962
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:58,290
<i>Are you afraid of death?</i>

963
02:03:59,730 --> 02:04:02,130
<i>I'm more afraid of loneliness.</i>

964
02:04:03,610 --> 02:04:08,330
<i>Do you pray?</i>
-<i>Yes, for I believe in love.</i>

965
02:04:09,490 --> 02:04:11,450
I don't want to, Simone.

966
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:16,090
Where's Theo? I want my husband.

967
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:18,770
Theo will be here in less than an hour.

968
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:22,570
<i>What was the finest part of the show for you?</i>

969
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:25,610
<i>When the curtain went up.</i>

970
02:04:40,610 --> 02:04:42,850
<i>And as a woman?</i>

971
02:04:44,050 --> 02:04:46,050
<i>My first kiss.</i>

972
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:52,570
<i>Do you like the night?</i>
-<i>Yes, with lots of light.</i>

973
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:57,290
<i>The morning?</i>
-<i>With a piano and friends.</i>

974
02:04:57,490 --> 02:04:58,690
<i>The evening?</i>

975
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:01,610
<i>Because that's our morning.</i>

976
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:09,010
You see, you're breathing.

977
02:05:16,690 --> 02:05:18,610
I can't go back.

978
02:05:22,370 --> 02:05:24,130
I can't.

979
02:06:01,610 --> 02:06:05,170
<i>What advice would you give a woman?</i>

980
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:07,850
<i>Love.</i>

981
02:06:08,090 --> 02:06:10,890
<i>To a young girl?</i>
-<i>Love.</i>

982
02:06:11,090 --> 02:06:14,410
<i>To a child?</i>
-<i>Love.</i>

983
02:06:17,410 --> 02:06:19,530
Whom are you knitting for?

984
02:06:21,130 --> 02:06:23,890
For anyone who'll wear my sweaters.

985
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:29,210
That's it. I hope it wasn't too long.

986
02:06:31,410 --> 02:06:34,810
Thank you so much, madame.
-Thank you too.

987
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:22,450
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

988
02:07:23,050 --> 02:07:27,290
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

989
02:07:28,130 --> 02:07:33,170
<i>not the good times I had</i>

990
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:38,810
<i>not the pain</i>
<i>it means nothing to me</i>

991
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:43,690
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

992
02:07:44,370 --> 02:07:48,530
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

993
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:53,970
<i>it is done,</i>
<i>wiped away</i>

994
02:07:54,530 --> 02:08:01,770
<i>erased, the past</i>
<i>interests me not at all</i>

995
02:08:02,090 --> 02:08:05,210
<i>with my souvenirs</i>

996
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:08,130
<i>I build a fire</i>

997
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:11,250
<i>my sadness, my pleasure</i>

998
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:14,210
<i>I don't need it any longer</i>

999
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:16,650
<i>the loves are gone</i>

1000
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:19,610
<i>the traumas as well</i>

1001
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:22,650
<i>erased for ever</i>

1002
02:08:23,210 --> 02:08:27,450
<i>I must start anew</i>

1003
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:34,010
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

1004
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:38,490
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

1005
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:44,330
<i>not the good times I had</i>

1006
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:50,210
<i>not the pain</i>
<i>it means nothing to me</i>

1007
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:55,210
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

1008
02:08:55,410 --> 02:08:59,610
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

1009
02:09:00,410 --> 02:09:02,490
<i>because my life</i>

1010
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:05,570
<i>and my joy</i>

1011
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:08,490
<i>today</i>

1012
02:09:09,090 --> 02:09:17,050
<i>begins with you.</i>

1013
02:09:20,610 --> 02:09:23,570
<i>Edith Piaf died on 9 October 1963.</i>
<i>She was only forty-seven...</i>
