00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,579
SALO, or THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM

00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:20,681
Masters

Male victims

Female victims

Daughters

Militia

Collaborators

Servants

00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:52,179
Written and directed by

11
00:02:54,735 --> 00:03:00,350
Northern ltaly, during the
Nazi-Fascist occupation

12
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,579
ANTE INFERNO

13
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:28,549
Your Excellency

14
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,353
President

15
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,605
Your Grace

16
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:10,018
AII things are good when
taken to excess

17
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:47,028
Come on, let's go

18
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:10,955
Where are you going?

19
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:55,937
Claudio! Your scarf, my son!

20
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,944
Sorry, we're obeying orders

21
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:38,022
Marrying each others' daughters will
seal our destinies for ever

22
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:43,767
President, take as your IawfuI spouse
His ExceIIency's daughter, Tatiana

23
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,588
President, I wiII marry
your daughter, Susy

24
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:54,174
Your Excellency and my brother the
Bishop will marry my daughters

25
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:58,275
The preparations for our
undertaking are completed

26
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:09,287
In puberty's ambush, maidens bloom,
all unaware of impending doom

27
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,663
They listen to the radio, drink tea,
unaware they will lose their liberty

28
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:22,043
Bourgeois recoil not from slaughter
though victim be son and daughter

29
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,888
- What's this one's name?
- Claudio Cicchetti

30
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:33,824
- What is your name?
- Franco

31
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,781
I knew you'd consider him

32
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:37,979
A girI heIped us catch him

33
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:42,435
The fooI thought he was in for
romance, and ended up in a sack

34
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:49,138
- What is your name?
- Sergio

35
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,711
Shouldn't we inspect them?

36
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:00,585
Trousers down, shirts up

37
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:33,125
That will do

38
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:29,954
Lamberto Gobbi

39
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,149
Carlo Porro

40
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:38,248
Umberto Chessari... just Iook
at him, gentIemen

41
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:44,305
I waited two whoIe weeks
to ambush him

42
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:58,826
...and this is Ferruccio Tonna,
from Castelfranco

43
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:01,219
From a subversive famiIy

44
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:13,336
The one with the curly hair,
Tonino Orlando

45
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:16,008
I know him

46
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:19,875
I've waited two Iong years for him

47
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:21,912
Your Excellency, please help me

48
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:26,415
His father was a senior judge,
Iike myseIf

49
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:29,926
A southerner, aren't you?

50
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:35,114
Don't expect me to deflower you.
In time we will decide..

51
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:38,858
...who will do you that
delightful honour

52
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:42,693
That's right, Tonino

53
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,265
Eva, come along

54
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,309
Try to behave yourseIf

55
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,632
Come, no one will harm you

56
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,741
Show these nice gentlemen
all your hidden charms

57
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,304
What a beauty

58
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:40,729
A delicious bum, solid yet bouncy

59
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:45,875
Tits to revive a dying crippIe

60
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:48,499
Bring us another one

61
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:53,809
Signora Castelli, your turn.
The gentlemen are waiting

62
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,828
Please let me go home

63
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,302
Albertina's father is a professor
in Bologna

64
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:47,723
To slip her out of the convent school
we had to convince two nuns

65
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,152
You'II prefer us to the sisters,
won't you?

66
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:53,785
I don't know yet, sir

67
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:55,693
Very well, undress her

68
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,994
Just a moment

69
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,676
We didn't notice her blemish.
She's a pretty virgin, too

70
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:37,172
Don't you disgrace me,
I know your IittIe tricks

71
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:46,987
We waited untiI she came out
with her mother...

72
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:51,850
...pushed the mother into the river,
where the damned fooI drowned...

73
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,674
...right before this angeI's eyes

74
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,496
There were nine boys, now only eight

75
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:12,556
Anyone know the difference between
"8", "no-no", and the family?

76
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,113
What's the difference?

77
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:19,900
"8" is twice four,
"no- no" is twice not for

78
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,725
- What about the family?
- They're fine, thank you

79
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:16,363
Everything is prepared
according to your wishes

80
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:57,520
You herded, feeble creatures,
destined for our pleasure

81
00:19:57,884 --> 00:20:03,577
Don't expect to find here the freedom
granted in the outside worId

82
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:08,044
You are beyond reach of
any "IegaIity"

83
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,112
No one knows you are here

84
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:15,582
As far as the world goes,
you are already dead

85
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:19,846
These are the Iaws which wiII
govern your Iives

86
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:27,507
"At six p.m., the company will
assemble in the "Hall of Orgies"...

87
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,777
"... where our Storytellers...

88
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:36,436
"...will tell us stories, each with
a particular theme

89
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:42,696
"Our friends have the right
to interrupt at any moment

90
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:49,197
"The purpose of the stories is to
inflame lust; all will be permitted

91
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:55,902
"After dinner, the gentlemen will
conduct the so-called orgies

92
00:20:56,983 --> 00:21:00,362
"The Great Hall will be
adequately heated

93
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:03,681
"Participants, appropriatedly
dressed...

94
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:08,346
"...will lie on the floor
like animals...

95
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:11,056
"...they will intermingle...

96
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:17,590
"...copulate indescriminately,
incestuously and sodomistically

97
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:21,738
"That will be the daily procedure"

98
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:23,695
No servants here!

99
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:41,205
"Any man caught in flagrante delicto
with a woman...

100
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,674
"...will be punished by
the loss of a limb

101
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:50,610
"The slightest religious act by
anyone will be punished...

102
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:53,326
"...by death"

103
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:09,589
CIRCLE OF MANIAS

104
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:17,902
I was born at a girIs' boarding
schooI, where my mother was a servant

105
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:22,009
One day, my sister asked if
I knew Professor GentiIe

106
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:25,837
"Well, look outside, he's waiting
for you...

107
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:29,665
"...to show you something
he's shown me"

108
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:33,098
She said: "Don't run away

109
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:36,289
"He'II give you some money"

110
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:41,474
I ran out to meet him.
I couIdn't beIieve it

111
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:47,531
- "Where are you going?"
- "To put away the chairs, Professor"

112
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,118
"Your sister will do that. I'll show
you something you've never seen"

113
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:56,145
I foIIowed him into a room

114
00:23:56,832 --> 00:24:02,764
He took his huge penis from out of
his trousers and began to masturbate

115
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:05,719
"Have you ever seen the Iike?

116
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:09,544
"I've shown your sister and
girIs of your age

117
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:15,289
"Give me a hand. Provoke the semen
from which we're all created

118
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:19,118
"I'II make it spurt on your face

119
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:22,942
"This is my sole passion, my child...

120
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,454
"...and you are about to see it"

121
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,010
At that very moment...

122
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:33,592
...I was immersed in a white jet,
drenching me from head to toe

123
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,816
You mustn't omit any detaiI...

124
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:45,713
...otherwise your stories will not
arouse us sufficiently

125
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,463
I know I was urged to give
every detaiI...

126
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:09,204
...every particular,
even the slightest...

127
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:14,946
...that may illuminate the
human passion

128
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:17,979
I've not overIooked anything

129
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:24,196
You haven't given us details about
the size of the Professor's penis...

130
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:28,023
...or the nature, the consistency
of his emisssion

131
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:33,769
Did you fondle his genitals,
did he oblige you to do so?

132
00:25:34,453 --> 00:25:37,595
Dear Signora Vaccari, more clarity

133
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:43,022
From now on I shaII conceaI nothing.
May I continue?

134
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,406
Time the staff of my old age
had some fun

135
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:56,620
Shortly after my seventh birthday...

136
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:59,929
...I took a girI friend to see
the Professor

137
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:04,718
One of his colleagues was with him.
They drew me inside

138
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,221
Looking at me, one said to the other:

139
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:12,695
"Goffredo, didn't I teII you
she was a IittIe beauty?"

140
00:26:13,055 --> 00:26:17,796
"She is a rare IittIe jeweI",
repIied Goffredo

141
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:25,134
Then he took me onto his Iap
and gave me a kiss

142
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:28,639
- "How old are you?"
- "Seven, Professor"

143
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:32,466
"You are fifty years younger than me"

144
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:36,295
Then he gave me another kiss

145
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:40,769
Meanwhile, the other prepared
some kind of strange syrup

146
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:46,825
They made me drink it, saying:
"It wiII make you pee"

147
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:51,931
"AII we want of you, dear chiId,
is that you urinate

148
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:56,038
"And that you do that with me,
alone together"

149
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:05,333
I want this miserabIe boy
punished severeIy

150
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:08,197
We are at your service

151
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:12,990
He had the insolence to
pull away from me

152
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:17,135
You can choose one of ours

153
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:20,203
No, thank you

154
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:30,012
It wouId take too much to
satisfy me now

155
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:35,636
A moment ago, only the slightest
effort would suffice, but now...

156
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:42,655
You know to what we're driven
by frustrated desire

157
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,083
AII I ask of you...

158
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,590
...is exemplary punishment
for this bastard

159
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:57,016
My Lord, I feeI ready to satisfy you

160
00:27:57,695 --> 00:28:00,520
I need no instruction

161
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:03,393
No, Iet me be

162
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:10,725
There are a thousand occasions when
one does not desire a woman's anus

163
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:15,359
I'II wait. Let Signora Vaccari
continue her story

164
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:22,531
Everything was so arranged that he
swallowed every drop of my piss

165
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:26,357
At that moment his penis,
overcome by victory...

166
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:30,186
...cried tears of blood over me

167
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:35,613
Then, passion consumed, the Professor
seemed to realize...

168
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:41,989
...his idoI no Ionger inspired
such reIigious fervour

169
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:50,171
Without ado, he put ten Iire in my
apron pocket and pushed me out

170
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:03,131
The boy's hopeless at masturbation,
he needs a lesson

171
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:07,511
You'd think he'd never seen
a man's tooI

172
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,787
Well, friends...

173
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,894
...Signora Vaccari will turn them
into first-class whores

174
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:31,444
Nothing is more contagious than eviI

175
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:33,678
You are mistaken, Your Excellency

176
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:38,702
Some can do eviI onIy when
passion drives them to it

177
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:45,156
They are always unhappy, regretting
the evils of the previous night

178
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:44,812
Umberto, Franco... what do you say?

179
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:04,080
Handsome

180
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,076
Efisio, it's my turn

181
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,835
On the Perati bridge

182
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:04,257
A black flag flies

183
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:10,950
The mourning of the Julian regiment
that goes to war

184
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:40,939
The best young men lie
under the earth

185
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:22,571
The gentleman are not satisfied
with you

186
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:26,558
The first thing you must Iearn
is how to hoId it

187
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:01,978
Go on

188
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:09,631
Up and down

189
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,458
Squeeze it harder...

190
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:16,332
...and stroke beneath with
the other hand

191
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:21,119
Slut! See how it's done

192
00:34:40,303 --> 00:34:43,525
There were nine girls, now only eight

193
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:47,591
Here's a number eight story

194
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:51,657
It's about a man who had a friend
named Six-times-eight

195
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:57,166
Going home in the blackout one night
they lost each other

196
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,996
Our man tried to find his friend,
Iooking everywhere

197
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,782
At Iast he thought he saw something
in the darkness

198
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:11,761
He was overjoyed, thinking he had
found his friend

199
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:17,264
- He cried: "Six-times-eight!"
- "Forty-eight", came the repIy

200
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:25,235
Music! Signora Vaccari will tell us
another story...

201
00:35:25,604 --> 00:35:29,064
...to stimulate us for
another skirmish

202
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:38,961
I was nine when my sister took me to
MiIan to meet Signora CaIzetti

203
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:43,428
She examined me and asked if I
wanted to work for her

204
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:47,565
I said I wouId, if the pay was good

205
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:53,948
My first client, a stout man named
Vaccari, looked me over carefully

206
00:35:54,954 --> 00:36:00,967
At once I showed him my pussy,
which I thought was very speciaI

207
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:07,352
He covered his eyes:
"Out of the question

208
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:12,774
"I'm not interested in your vagina,
cover it up"

209
00:36:14,415 --> 00:36:17,874
He covered me up, making me Iie down

210
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,623
He said: "AII these IittIe whores
know is to fIaunt their vaginas

211
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:28,013
"Now I'II have to recover from
that disgusting sight"

212
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:32,119
He wrapped me in a sheet,
Iike a mummy...

213
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,707
...Ieaving onIy my behind uncovered

214
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:41,810
He caressed it gently, opened
and closed the cheeks...

215
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,995
...began to suck it greedlily

216
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,825
Then he carefully...

217
00:36:50,465 --> 00:36:56,158
...put his member between my buttocks,
his movements became frenzied

218
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:06,047
"Such an adorable behind, the sweet
little anus. Now I'll anoint it"

219
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,241
He said that three or four times

220
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:12,754
I never saw him again

221
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:14,590
Your first client...

222
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,135
...had an idea of women that
most of us do not share

223
00:37:19,495 --> 00:37:22,558
Homage to the rear temple...

224
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:25,988
...is more fervent than the other

225
00:37:26,514 --> 00:37:30,620
I put this question to the company

226
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:36,357
How can we determine the true
inclination of a boy or girl?

227
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,673
Their best part, in other words

228
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:44,019
I beIieve by masturbation of the
requisite body areas

229
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,521
Let's take the youngsters about whom
we have doubts...

230
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,507
...and take them aside to verify

231
00:37:58,097 --> 00:38:03,792
Observing, with equaI passion
and apathy, Guido and Vaccari...

232
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:06,991
...masturbating the two bodies
which belong to us...

233
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:10,809
...inspires a number of interesting
reflections

234
00:38:11,178 --> 00:38:14,319
Would you care to elaborate,
dear Duke?

235
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:17,069
We Fascists are the only true
anarchists

236
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:18,907
Naturally...

237
00:38:19,473 --> 00:38:23,577
...once we've become masters of the
state, true anarchy is that of power

238
00:38:23,939 --> 00:38:27,126
However, Iook at their
obscene gestures...

239
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,434
...Iike deaf-mute Ianguage...

240
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,012
...with a code none of us can break,
no matter how great our power

241
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:39,207
There is nothing to be done

242
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:43,827
We must restrict our impulses
to a single gesture

243
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,775
He came. Now he is a man

244
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:55,032
Little Sergio, we're proud of you

245
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,540
- She's a woman now
- Our first couple has been formed

246
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,176
Sergio, you've proved you're a man

247
00:39:03,817 --> 00:39:05,132
She is your prize

248
00:39:32,528 --> 00:39:33,957
Come forward

249
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:42,098
Appreciate the goodwill of
these gentlemen...

250
00:39:42,737 --> 00:39:46,718
...who allow you to enjoy such
a great privilege...

251
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:49,387
...we will solemnize your marriage

252
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,680
What a fine thing

253
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,943
What a whore

254
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,594
Get out, you sluts!

255
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:24,296
Let us resume the ceremony

256
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:26,379
Will you, Sergio...

257
00:41:27,058 --> 00:41:29,519
...take Renata for your wife?

258
00:41:35,154 --> 00:41:38,499
I pronounce you man and wife

259
00:41:56,409 --> 00:41:58,552
Clear off, all of you!

260
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:20,287
lf you salute him,
then you are bound

261
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:26,666
lf you are for him,
if you are sound

262
00:42:27,035 --> 00:42:31,492
Then you must join up,
honour bound

263
00:42:39,795 --> 00:42:43,255
Lustily! Aren't you newlyweds?

264
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:47,405
Give rein to your feelings

265
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,052
Get busy, idiot

266
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:59,509
No! That flower is reserved for us

267
00:44:58,252 --> 00:45:01,314
The principle of all greatness
on earth...

268
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:06,502
...has Iong been bathed in bIood

269
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:12,244
My friends, if memory does not
betray me:

270
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:18,307
"Without bloodshed, there is
no forgiveness

271
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,935
"No forgiveness without bloodshed".
Baudelaire

272
00:45:22,498 --> 00:45:25,957
Excellency, the expression is not
to be found in Baudelaire...

273
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:29,910
...but in Nietzsche's
The Genealogy of Morals

274
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:34,888
It is neither from Baudelaire
nor Nietzsche...

275
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:40,317
...nor in Saint Paul’s
Epistle to the Romans

276
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:41,827
It's Dada

277
00:45:42,596 --> 00:45:48,290
Sing me that sweet melody
l loved so much, that goes da-da

278
00:45:49,615 --> 00:45:55,627
Delicious creature, do you want
my dirty underpants?

279
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:59,454
My old underpants. What incomparable
refinement

280
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:03,600
You see how sensitive I am
to the value of things

281
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:10,621
Little angel, my greatest desire is
to grant your wish

282
00:46:11,308 --> 00:46:14,450
You know I respect aII tastes
and whims

283
00:46:15,096 --> 00:46:18,284
However baroque, all deserve
to be respected

284
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:26,575
Because we're not their masters,
even the most bizarre manias...

285
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,317
...derive from a basic principle
of refinement

286
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,423
Yes, old buggers, it's a question
of delicacy

287
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,841
One day Madam sent me to
another Iibertine

288
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:06,773
He took me to a room with
a splendid Chinese carpet

289
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:12,197
After making me undress, he ordered
me on all fours, like an animal

290
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,003
Having stroked my head two or
three times...

291
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,182
...he said: "I want to see if you're
as quick as my dogs"

292
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:32,532
He threw two chestnuts across
the room...

293
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:36,404
...saying: "Good bitch, fetch!"

294
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:49,088
I thought it best to go aIong
with the game

295
00:48:00,415 --> 00:48:04,520
You have two beautifuI eyes...
then Iook

296
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,943
Piss

297
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:41,197
"Filthy muck, putrid bitch",
he shouted, approaching me

298
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:46,946
Then he ejaculated over my back

299
00:48:49,544 --> 00:48:51,733
Then he Ieft

300
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,603
I dressed...

301
00:48:55,287 --> 00:48:59,063
...and discovered 25,000 Iire
in my coat

302
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:22,494
Eat!

303
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:46,936
Your Excellency, are you convinced?

304
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:51,688
It is when I see others degraded
that I rejoice...

305
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:57,266
...knowing it is better to be me
than the scum of "the people"

306
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:03,485
Whenever men are equal, without that
difference, happiness cannot exist

307
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:07,630
So you wouldn't aid the humble,
the unhappy

308
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:10,110
In aII the worId...

309
00:51:10,553 --> 00:51:14,329
...no voluptuousness flatters the
senses more than social privilege

310
00:52:48,174 --> 00:52:52,598
My next story is about the mania
of Minister MissiroIi

311
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:56,735
I went to the Minister's office
at ten one morning

312
00:52:57,426 --> 00:52:59,807
The moment I entered,
the doors cIosed

313
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:04,076
"What are you doing here,
you IittIe bitch?

314
00:53:04,444 --> 00:53:08,221
"Who gave you permission
to disturb me?"

315
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:13,768
I hadn't been warned of what
wouId happen...

316
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:16,840
...so I was frightened by the weIcome

317
00:53:21,671 --> 00:53:23,146
I can't take any more

318
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:35,025
He tore off my clothes,
shredded them...

319
00:53:35,389 --> 00:53:40,130
...and threw them into the fire

320
00:53:57,004 --> 00:54:02,777
Then he stretched out
seemingly semi-conscious...

321
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:06,927
...in a chair...

322
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,165
...and ejaculated...

323
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:14,269
...making his sperm fall upon the
charred remains of my clothes

324
00:54:18,736 --> 00:54:20,687
CIRCLE OF SHIT

325
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:58,581
Don't you think, Signora Maggi...

326
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:04,962
...that before your stories, you
should show us your best part?

327
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:08,790
With the greatest of pleasure

328
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:17,048
These buttocks merit our attention

329
00:56:18,092 --> 00:56:21,199
I have seIdom seen better

330
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:24,302
Very kind of you to say so

331
00:56:27,144 --> 00:56:30,172
We thank you. Please begin

332
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:36,545
I see that you gentIemen esteem
the rear end...

333
00:56:37,552 --> 00:56:42,292
...so I shaII devote my stories
to this subject

334
00:56:42,657 --> 00:56:45,004
My story will interest you all...

335
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:50,711
...especially our dear President;
it concerns a particular mania...

336
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:56,453
...his dearest caprice, which
enabled me to make his acquaintance

337
00:56:57,012 --> 00:57:01,357
ConceaI my turpitudes from
these innocents

338
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:06,817
Enough. I am eager to hear
Signora Maggi's voice

339
00:57:12,325 --> 00:57:18,337
My childhood years were spent in
endowing my body with the capacity...

340
00:57:19,663 --> 00:57:24,200
...to satisfy the basest,
most outrageous desires

341
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:27,592
I soon became expert in that
difficuIt task...

342
00:57:27,957 --> 00:57:30,782
...and my fame spread throughout
ItaIy

343
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,574
My clients included many
celebrities...

344
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:37,796
...and to them I gave the best
of myseIf

345
00:57:40,399 --> 00:57:45,140
My first story concerns a most
curious episode in my Iife

346
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:49,602
Signora Evola, the Madam
I worked for...

347
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:55,664
...sent me to a client after feeding
me a large laxative-spiced meal

348
00:57:57,388 --> 00:57:59,815
The client was an old
Carabinieri General

349
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:03,321
He made me undress him and
put a nappy on him

350
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:08,429
I was used to such fixations,
I was ready to heIp him

351
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:13,772
Suddenly, my bowels rebelled and he
ordered me to relieve myself...

352
00:58:14,216 --> 00:58:18,878
...which I did without embarrassment

353
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,379
He made me dip my fingers in
the excrement...

354
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:29,484
...and feed it to him Iike a baby

355
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:35,864
He swallowed everything, imitating
the cries of a baby...

356
00:58:36,548 --> 00:58:38,736
...and ejaculated into his nappy

357
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:44,155
I knew a man capabIe of quite diverse
refinements of the sort

358
00:58:44,523 --> 00:58:47,982
We expect only the best tales of you

359
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:54,999
My next story took place in Verona

360
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:01,065
I was toId that the cIient
waiting at a hoteI...

361
00:59:01,432 --> 00:59:05,855
...was an old nobleman,
notorious for his depravity

362
00:59:06,536 --> 00:59:09,678
My curiosity was immense

363
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:14,469
That evening my mother was more
intolerant than usual

364
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:18,855
She pleaded with me not to go

365
00:59:19,297 --> 00:59:23,073
I couIdn't resist the temptation,
so I kiIIed her

366
00:59:23,843 --> 00:59:26,587
The only thing to do

367
00:59:29,187 --> 00:59:33,168
The excitement awaiting you was
supreme...

368
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:37,317
...meriting the utmost sacrifice

369
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:41,101
It's foIIy to say one owes
anything to one's mother

370
00:59:41,549 --> 00:59:46,289
Must we be gratefuI for her having
pIeasure with a man?

371
00:59:46,653 --> 00:59:49,477
That should have been enough
reward for her

372
00:59:50,163 --> 00:59:53,939
Long ago, I was cursed with
a mother...

373
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:58,086
...who aroused the same feelings
you felt for yours

374
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,554
As soon as I couId, I sent her
to the next worId

375
01:00:02,924 --> 01:00:08,935
It was a profound pIeasure when she
cIosed her eyes for the Iast time

376
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:16,642
Why is that child crying?

377
01:00:17,598 --> 01:00:22,657
Your words remind her of her mother

378
01:00:23,022 --> 01:00:26,799
Her mother died trying to protect her

379
01:00:27,488 --> 01:00:28,712
Splendid!

380
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:32,307
It's your mother you're crying for?

381
01:00:32,911 --> 01:00:35,338
Come here, Iet me consoIe you

382
01:00:38,974 --> 01:00:42,115
Come back to Papa's arms

383
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,070
He'll sing you another lullaby

384
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,771
What an opportunity you offer me

385
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:53,679
Signora Maggi's story merits
immediate re-enactment

386
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:02,851
I beg you to have mercy on
my suffering

387
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:10,507
My mother died for me and
I'II never see her again

388
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:14,103
Undress her immediateIy

389
01:01:18,851 --> 01:01:24,306
Kill me! God will take pity on me!
Don't dishonour me!

390
01:01:24,913 --> 01:01:29,847
This howling is the most exciting
thing I've ever heard

391
01:01:30,655 --> 01:01:36,667
Kill me! Free me from this torment,
seeing and hearing such horrors!

392
01:01:38,471 --> 01:01:40,500
You all heard her call on God

393
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:44,051
Your Excellency, enter her name
in the Penal Register...

394
01:01:44,692 --> 01:01:46,880
...for a terrible punishment

395
01:01:47,563 --> 01:01:51,386
Do away with me, so that
I can be with my mother

396
01:01:52,029 --> 01:01:58,041
You will be punished and deflowered
when we decide the time is ripe

397
01:02:00,324 --> 01:02:06,540
Don't think your tears restrain my
desire; they make me more ruthless

398
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:47,488
Come here, my child, it's ready

399
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:49,174
On your knees!

400
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,106
Go on!

401
01:03:13,062 --> 01:03:14,615
Eat it

402
01:04:34,772 --> 01:04:38,514
That stupid girI's making a scene
over such a deIicacy

403
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:43,619
A friend insisted that all the
excrement he ate every day...

404
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:47,884
...come from a beggar woman, so it
would be more putrid and delicious

405
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:52,636
I found an oId woman of seventy
for him

406
01:05:15,247 --> 01:05:19,024
Spoiled food can provoke
excellent diarrhoea

407
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:25,406
The subject should eat hastily, at
odd hours, to overload the stomach

408
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:29,001
We must try that at once

409
01:05:35,027 --> 01:05:37,295
Dear President

410
01:05:37,898 --> 01:05:43,275
I am eager to know how you
first met Signora Maggi

411
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:49,337
She will tell you after His Honour
has married his Sergio

412
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:51,971
Then you'II Iaugh at my expense

413
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,637
I won't deprive you of that pIeasure

414
01:05:55,126 --> 01:06:00,819
Today's story demands a revision
of our rules

415
01:06:01,187 --> 01:06:04,647
If we wish to enjoy the fruit...

416
01:06:05,015 --> 01:06:07,522
...of our stay within these walls...

417
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:12,945
...Iet us revise some of our ruIes

418
01:06:13,988 --> 01:06:17,731
For example, we put containers in the
latrines to collect all excrement...

419
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:21,475
...so that nothing goes to waste

420
01:06:21,924 --> 01:06:26,664
Let's follow Signora Maggi's example,
giving our dear President...

421
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:31,293
...the joy of seeing his dream
come true

422
01:06:43,298 --> 01:06:45,169
Good day, Signora Castelli

423
01:06:45,532 --> 01:06:48,480
I'm sorry, we'II be ready in a moment

424
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:51,104
I've come to make sure

425
01:06:51,593 --> 01:06:53,940
The chamber pots, quick!

426
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:38,242
You know the rules!

427
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,032
Tell me your name!

428
01:07:42,637 --> 01:07:46,334
I couIdn't heIp it, with the muck
we're given to eat

429
01:07:47,103 --> 01:07:47,931
Your name?

430
01:07:48,379 --> 01:07:51,963
It's Doris, the most undisciplined
of our girIs

431
01:07:56,035 --> 01:08:02,047
She will be company for those
already listed here

432
01:08:24,109 --> 01:08:26,775
- Whose is this?
- Mine. Help yourself

433
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:30,838
Is that how you obey our ruIes,
impertinent brat?

434
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:36,151
Show me this boy's arse

435
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:55,644
You even dared to wipe yourself.
You'll get what you deserve

436
01:09:10,368 --> 01:09:12,318
We're ready...

437
01:09:13,559 --> 01:09:19,332
...but preparing this one meant that
I couIdn't watch these rogues

438
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:25,193
There is no evasion

439
01:09:25,681 --> 01:09:27,586
Unless the German people fall...

440
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:31,851
...we are prepared for any
eventuality ...

441
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:36,486
...to save a human soul,
even in this part of Africa

442
01:09:47,534 --> 01:09:50,756
We are happy to carry out
your every command

443
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:59,457
Those I considered the most
capabIe...

444
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:02,642
...were fed appropriately

445
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:09,023
Thus as this solemn wedding feast we
shall enjoy the greatest delicacy

446
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:14,130
Our girls abstained from relieving
themselves all day...

447
01:10:14,492 --> 01:10:17,633
...in compliance with your decree...

448
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:21,464
...that we produce this for you

449
01:10:22,148 --> 01:10:24,020
Let the rite begin

450
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:29,441
Our guide restored the divine
character of monstrosity...

451
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:34,546
...thanks to reiterated actions,
that is to say: rites

452
01:10:35,428 --> 01:10:39,647
No more intoxicating desire exists...

453
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:42,441
...endowing you with the vigour...

454
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:45,709
...to meet the challenge awaiting you

455
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:51,129
Eat, my exquisite bride

456
01:10:51,818 --> 01:10:57,511
You must prepare for our night
of Iove

457
01:10:59,474 --> 01:11:03,455
Nothing's worse than a breath
without odour

458
01:11:15,425 --> 01:11:17,375
I can't do it

459
01:11:17,977 --> 01:11:19,928
Offer it to the Madonna

460
01:11:38,714 --> 01:11:40,268
Do this

461
01:11:42,862 --> 01:11:46,967
Say: "I can't eat rice with
my fingers Iike this"

462
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:51,152
Then eat shit

463
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:18,224
I refer, as you wiII have guessed...

464
01:12:18,592 --> 01:12:22,697
...to our illustrious President

465
01:12:23,059 --> 01:12:25,882
After having satisfied him...

466
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:30,672
...I was impressed by such speciaI
tastes in one so young

467
01:12:33,587 --> 01:12:37,408
Tastes that will become clearer later

468
01:12:40,366 --> 01:12:42,792
Liberated from my mother...

469
01:12:43,157 --> 01:12:47,659
...I found Iife rich in aII
its deIights

470
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:58,102
One day Madam presented me to
the Iibertine in question

471
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:02,576
His passion will strike you
as somewhat unusual

472
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:10,224
The scene took place in his house.
I was shown into a darkened room

473
01:13:11,869 --> 01:13:15,329
I saw a man Iying on the bed...

474
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:19,476
...and a coffin in the middle
of the room

475
01:13:20,802 --> 01:13:23,943
"You see before you...", he said...

476
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,455
"...a man on his deathbed...

477
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:31,281
"...but he doesn't want to close
his eyes...

478
01:13:31,648 --> 01:13:37,025
"...without making a Iast homage to
the object of his adoration

479
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:40,533
"I adore the behind

480
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:45,643
"Although I am dying, I wish to die
kissing one

481
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,741
"When Iife has Ieft my body...

482
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:54,568
"...place me in the coffin...

483
01:13:55,257 --> 01:13:59,033
"...wrap me in my shroud and
close the coffin lid

484
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:05,104
"I insist that you observe my orders
to the Ietter

485
01:14:05,466 --> 01:14:11,477
"In this supreme moment with the
soIe object of my Iewd desire

486
01:14:12,483 --> 01:14:14,990
"Come quickly!"

487
01:14:15,354 --> 01:14:18,496
He went on, his voice broken, sobbing

488
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:23,604
"Hurry! I am at death's door"

489
01:14:23,969 --> 01:14:28,708
So I went to him and showed him
my backside

490
01:14:29,073 --> 01:14:32,532
"Oh, what a marvellous arse

491
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:41,465
"Having seen this, my Iife can end.
I've never seen one as aIIuring"

492
01:14:42,153 --> 01:14:46,894
He fondled it, opened it

493
01:14:47,576 --> 01:14:52,635
He played with it, kissed it, just as
would the healthiest of men

494
01:14:53,318 --> 01:14:59,330
He made me relieve myself of all
that was in my bowels

495
01:15:00,018 --> 01:15:02,843
I was not at aII embarrassed

496
01:15:03,527 --> 01:15:08,904
"Now it is the time for me to die.
The supreme moment has come"

497
01:15:10,227 --> 01:15:15,921
As he said that, he gave
a profound sigh

498
01:15:29,368 --> 01:15:32,509
Piss over me

499
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:42,721
I can't, it won't come

500
01:16:06,056 --> 01:16:08,086
I've finished

501
01:16:16,265 --> 01:16:20,041
The Iimitation of Iove is that
you need an accompIice

502
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:24,508
Your friend will know the
libertine's refinement...

503
01:16:24,878 --> 01:16:28,655
...is being executioner and victim

504
01:16:31,698 --> 01:16:35,044
My sister knew an officiaI
in the ControIIer's office

505
01:16:35,406 --> 01:16:39,182
A IittIe pig-Iike man,
with a disgusting face

506
01:16:40,192 --> 01:16:42,698
A chamber pot was arranged...

507
01:16:43,063 --> 01:16:47,169
...for two to sit on, back to back,
and relieve themselves simultaneously

508
01:16:48,486 --> 01:16:51,627
He stirred it with his fingers,
and swallowed it

509
01:16:51,996 --> 01:16:55,375
My sister told me...

510
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:59,963
...he'd only to see her dirty arse
and he ejaculated

511
01:17:00,609 --> 01:17:03,750
Did your sister have a
pretty backside?

512
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,902
You must judge by this.
A famous painter...

513
01:17:08,266 --> 01:17:12,371
...was commissioned to paint a Venus
with a splendid backside

514
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:16,193
He selected her as his model
after many weeks...

515
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,984
...Iooking at hundreds of behinds
throughout ItaIy

516
01:17:22,621 --> 01:17:24,810
How old was she then?

517
01:17:25,493 --> 01:17:27,364
Fifteen, Duke

518
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:33,865
Why don't you arrange a competition
to find the nicest bottom here?

519
01:17:34,744 --> 01:17:38,522
I'II do that. I'm an expert

520
01:17:46,549 --> 01:17:50,892
Your Excellency, doesn't this
situation suggest anything to you?

521
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:52,480
It might

522
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:58,624
- Aren't you ready?
- Just a moment

523
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:05,003
The act of the sodomite signifies
the death of the human species

524
01:18:05,371 --> 01:18:08,036
Ambiguously accepting social
standards while transgressing them

525
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:13,295
More monstrous than the act
of the sodomite...

526
01:18:13,985 --> 01:18:16,411
...is the act of the executioner

527
01:18:16,856 --> 01:18:20,520
True, but the act of the sodomite
can be repeated again and again

528
01:18:21,642 --> 01:18:25,826
I think there is a way to repeat
the act of the executioner

529
01:18:39,108 --> 01:18:40,979
Turn off the Iights

530
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:49,068
Here is my masterpiece

531
01:18:55,258 --> 01:18:58,127
I have a proposaI to make

532
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:05,258
We have not yet decided on
the winner's prize...

533
01:19:05,906 --> 01:19:08,650
...for the best bottom

534
01:19:09,096 --> 01:19:11,648
Here is my proposaI

535
01:19:11,967 --> 01:19:17,344
He or she whose bottom is
judged the best...

536
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:19,819
...will be killed immediately

537
01:19:22,176 --> 01:19:23,729
Agreed

538
01:19:31,428 --> 01:19:36,168
This way we'II be impartiaI, not
knowing whose bottom we are viewing

539
01:19:36,532 --> 01:19:40,637
- A shrewd observation
- Thank you, Your Excellency

540
01:19:40,998 --> 01:19:45,422
For if we knew we were Iooking at
a boy rather than a girI...

541
01:19:45,783 --> 01:19:48,608
...we might be influenced
in making our decision

542
01:19:48,973 --> 01:19:51,798
We must be completely
free in our choice

543
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,581
A clever trap I wish to avoid

544
01:19:57,907 --> 01:20:02,647
When one prefers men, it is difficult
to change one's perspective

545
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:06,471
The difference between a boy and
a girI is enormous

546
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:10,935
One cannot consider what is
obviously inferior

547
01:20:13,539 --> 01:20:17,315
But if we consider all the
stories we have heard...

548
01:20:17,686 --> 01:20:22,426
...in certain cases a girI might be
preferabIe to a boy

549
01:20:23,429 --> 01:20:26,253
Let us try to remain objective

550
01:20:26,937 --> 01:20:31,361
Look at the elasticity of
those buttocks

551
01:20:31,723 --> 01:20:34,864
There can be no question here

552
01:20:35,232 --> 01:20:37,420
Allow me, Duke

553
01:20:37,784 --> 01:20:42,843
I don't wish to contradict, but may I
re- examine a most impressive one?

554
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:45,952
We'II be deIighted to grant
your request

555
01:20:46,398 --> 01:20:49,858
I don't think the heaviness of
these buttocks...

556
01:20:50,226 --> 01:20:54,604
...can be compared to the most
beautifuI we have here

557
01:20:55,012 --> 01:20:58,471
However, I wiII yieId to the
opinion of the majority

558
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,473
I vote for the Duke's candidate

559
01:21:01,393 --> 01:21:04,852
My vote goes to the Duke's
candidate

560
01:21:05,539 --> 01:21:08,681
Dear President, three votes to one

561
01:21:09,049 --> 01:21:10,920
I bow to the majority

562
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:16,976
But I request that my candidate
be reserved for me to defIower

563
01:21:17,343 --> 01:21:18,567
Granted

564
01:21:21,171 --> 01:21:23,360
We'II reveaI this mystery

565
01:21:42,228 --> 01:21:43,135
Fire!

566
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:53,581
You must be stupid to think that
death would be so easy

567
01:21:54,031 --> 01:21:57,490
Don't you know we intend to kill you
a thousand times?

568
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:02,237
To the end of eternity, if eternity
can have an end

569
01:22:03,283 --> 01:22:06,424
Once I had a very mysterious cIient

570
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:11,847
His mania was closely related to...

571
01:22:12,215 --> 01:22:17,909
...the subject of Signora Castelli's
stories, for which I apologize

572
01:22:18,277 --> 01:22:20,987
The man wanted only women...

573
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:24,926
...who had been condemned to death

574
01:22:25,615 --> 01:22:31,116
The closer they were to death,
the more he would pay

575
01:22:31,995 --> 01:22:36,101
He would visit them when the
sentence had been pronounced

576
01:22:36,461 --> 01:22:41,520
Thanks to his exalted social status,
enabling him to pay the price...

577
01:22:41,885 --> 01:22:44,709
...not a single one escaped him

578
01:22:45,633 --> 01:22:48,979
He did not possess them casually

579
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:53,964
He insisted on inspecting their rumps
and that they defecated before him

580
01:22:55,284 --> 01:23:00,660
He was convinced that the
tastiest faeces...

581
01:23:01,665 --> 01:23:07,676
...were those of women who had just
heard the sentence of death

582
01:23:11,993 --> 01:23:13,864
CIRCLE OF BLOOD

583
01:24:47,899 --> 01:24:50,167
Your Reverence, I am ready

584
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:53,594
We want a marvellous wedding

585
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,750
The President wishes to be first,
he is the most randy

586
01:24:59,384 --> 01:25:01,289
You whoresons!

587
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,676
What is this, a mortuary?

588
01:25:20,121 --> 01:25:23,386
These parasites do nothing
for this festive day

589
01:25:23,949 --> 01:25:26,898
Do anything you Iike.
Laugh, aII of you

590
01:25:27,777 --> 01:25:32,517
Go on, idiots, show how happy
you are

591
01:25:32,882 --> 01:25:35,434
Go on, Iaugh

592
01:25:38,105 --> 01:25:41,531
Why aren't you yelling for joy?
Go on, sing!

593
01:25:49,072 --> 01:25:50,897
You two, what are you doing?

594
01:25:51,385 --> 01:25:54,209
Excellency, note their names

595
01:25:56,529 --> 01:26:01,225
If you Iike to whimper, we'II make
you, for your Iast few days

596
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:16,216
Shouldn't you have paid your bills,
Monsieur Royale?

597
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,459
Of course, Monsieur Juju

598
01:26:18,821 --> 01:26:21,962
Shouldn't you also pay mine?

599
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:24,202
Why so?

600
01:26:24,563 --> 01:26:27,388
Because two and two make four
and I'm broke

601
01:26:27,753 --> 01:26:29,942
Earn some money

602
01:26:30,306 --> 01:26:34,412
- How do I do that?
- Through manuaI Iabour

603
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,643
I don't know how

604
01:26:37,005 --> 01:26:40,147
Then become an actor

605
01:26:40,514 --> 01:26:42,703
That's difficuIt

606
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:47,682
Try to write then;
all you have to write...

607
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:50,234
...is any old thing

608
01:26:59,656 --> 01:27:02,162
Are you crazy?

609
01:30:06,284 --> 01:30:08,871
I have a duty to perform;
I'II return Iater

610
01:30:09,475 --> 01:30:13,092
Your friend here is ready
whenever you are

611
01:31:53,795 --> 01:31:57,493
- Please, may I speak to you?
- Of course, my dear

612
01:31:57,943 --> 01:31:59,055
What will you do to me?

613
01:31:59,538 --> 01:32:03,485
Talk about that tomorrow;
many things will be decided then

614
01:32:04,004 --> 01:32:07,781
I know a secret. Someone is
vioIating your Iaw

615
01:32:08,152 --> 01:32:10,863
Graziella had a photograph
under her pillow

616
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:03,063
Give me that photograph

617
01:33:23,203 --> 01:33:26,900
Spare me and I'II teII you
what Eva and Antoniska do

618
01:33:27,908 --> 01:33:29,779
They're breaking your Iaws

619
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:06,228
Don't kill me. I have secrets
to tell you

620
01:34:06,828 --> 01:34:08,858
Speak, dirty whore!

621
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:11,763
Every night Ezio goes to the
black servant girl

622
01:34:12,571 --> 01:34:14,681
I can take you there

623
01:36:05,187 --> 01:36:07,057
Queers!

624
01:36:08,257 --> 01:36:09,810
You make me puke

625
01:36:57,027 --> 01:37:00,328
Those who are named will wear
a sky blue ribbon

626
01:37:00,696 --> 01:37:02,885
You can imagine what that means

627
01:37:03,248 --> 01:37:07,751
Others, if they collaborate, are
reprieved. They will return to Salò

628
01:37:08,353 --> 01:37:10,621
What are you going to do to us?

629
01:37:11,224 --> 01:37:15,330
You'II soon know the gravity
of your crimes

630
01:37:29,887 --> 01:37:33,028
The main character...

631
01:37:33,396 --> 01:37:38,137
...figured in a number of
the previous stories

632
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:42,277
He is forty, very powerfully built...

633
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:45,154
...with a member Iike a staIIion

634
01:37:46,157 --> 01:37:51,851
He is enormously rich,
very powerful, very cruel

635
01:37:53,176 --> 01:37:55,364
A heart of stone

636
01:37:56,686 --> 01:38:02,300
He owns a house near Milan, which
he uses exclusively for his pleasure

637
01:38:11,999 --> 01:38:15,662
At his parties, at Ieast fifteen
young girIs are present...

638
01:38:16,145 --> 01:38:18,652
...aged from fifteen to seventeen

639
01:38:19,016 --> 01:38:25,028
Those who are chosen must present
themselves completely naked

640
01:38:25,397 --> 01:38:30,456
He touches them, caresses them,
examines them...

641
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:35,245
...then makes them defecate into his
mouth, but he does not swallow it

642
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:41,300
After these first rituals,
with fearsome gravity...

643
01:38:42,305 --> 01:38:44,573
...he brands each girI
on the shouIder...

644
01:38:45,177 --> 01:38:48,126
...burning a number into
their tender flesh

645
01:38:49,324 --> 01:38:53,430
After these preliminaries,
he opens the window...

646
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:59,802
...and places a girl standing in the
middle of the room, facing the window

647
01:39:01,766 --> 01:39:06,190
Then gives such a powerfuI kick
to her behind...

648
01:39:06,551 --> 01:39:10,328
...that the poor thing flies across
the room...

649
01:39:10,698 --> 01:39:15,235
...through the window and vanishes
into a dark cellar

650
01:39:25,692 --> 01:39:31,705
Our hero is familiar not only with
Nietzsche, but Huysmans as well

651
01:39:34,626 --> 01:39:38,731
In the ceIIar, a masked executioner
with the deviI's embIems...

652
01:39:39,092 --> 01:39:44,469
...presides gravely over the
horrible machines

653
01:39:44,834 --> 01:39:48,610
When all the girls are in
the cellar, our hero...

654
01:39:51,853 --> 01:39:57,750
...is highly aroused, having so many
contacts without once ejaculating

655
01:39:59,829 --> 01:40:04,568
Naked, his huge member jutting
from his belly

656
01:40:07,485 --> 01:40:11,908
Now all the machines have begun
to function...

657
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:18,282
...all tortures at once, with
terrifyingly loud screeching

658
01:40:22,519 --> 01:40:25,945
The first apparatus is a huge wheeI
with razor bIades...

659
01:40:26,307 --> 01:40:30,083
...to which is bound a girI
to be fIayed aIive

660
01:40:33,326 --> 01:40:37,749
Another has a Iive rat sewed
inside her vagina

661
01:41:09,655 --> 01:41:13,681
Oh Lord, why hast thou foresaken us?

662
01:41:28,835 --> 01:41:31,660
A rational person...

663
01:41:32,345 --> 01:41:35,487
...is not content to kill
the same person

664
01:41:35,854 --> 01:41:40,913
He would recommend murdering
as many as possible

665
01:44:32,912 --> 01:44:34,784
Umberto, come here

666
01:45:24,156 --> 01:45:27,104
Bravo, always ready

667
01:46:43,433 --> 01:46:47,176
What does a Bolshevik do when
he dives into the Red Sea?

668
01:46:48,179 --> 01:46:51,638
You don't know what a Bolshevik does?

669
01:46:52,326 --> 01:46:53,391
No, tell me

670
01:46:53,921 --> 01:46:55,236
He goes splash!

671
01:46:57,949 --> 01:47:02,248
Poetry Corner. Ezra Pound.
The Cantos

672
01:47:05,606 --> 01:47:08,236
Canto 99

673
01:47:10,231 --> 01:47:14,007
The whole tribe is from
one man's body

674
01:47:14,259 --> 01:47:18,636
What other way can you think of it?

675
01:47:19,244 --> 01:47:20,957
The surname and the nine arts

676
01:47:22,314 --> 01:47:24,741
The father's word is compassion

677
01:47:25,505 --> 01:47:27,692
The son's, devotion

678
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:39,619
Small birds sing in chorus. Harmony
is in the proportion of branches

679
01:48:01,235 --> 01:48:07,247
The gay face of spring
is set before the world

680
01:48:14,953 --> 01:48:20,647
The sharpness of winter
now flees defeated

681
01:48:30,266 --> 01:48:36,278
In various apparel Flora reigns

682
01:48:38,561 --> 01:48:41,668
And in the euphony of the woods...

683
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:44,814
...she is hymned in song

684
01:50:34,047 --> 01:50:35,442
Can you dance?

685
01:50:37,158 --> 01:50:38,144
Let's try

686
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:11,646
- What's your girlfriend's name?
- Margherita
