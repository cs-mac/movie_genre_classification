1
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,141
They're waitin' for us, Big Max!

2
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,610
You can't catch me.

3
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,134
Hey Unc, he's comin'!

4
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,390
- You're still not ready?
- We're done.

5
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,018
The baglady again?

6
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,769
It's no good?

7
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,147
You've done it 30,000 times.

8
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,024
Do somethin' else.

9
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,279
I've done it lots,
and you always laughed.

10
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,404
We were in stitches at
Aunt Nunziata's birthday party too.

11
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,739
But do somethin' happier.

12
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,160
The baglady's no good anymore?

13
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:29,166
You're a riot,
we'll love whatever you do.

14
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,170
You rock!

15
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,637
I'm goin' down,
he's already here, move.

16
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,559
Your attention, please,
we're getting ready.

17
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,937
And now, the big moment...

18
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,062
The moment
we've all been waiting for!

19
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,943
Every woman's dream is here.

20
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,818
He lasted 116 days
in the Big Brother House!

21
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:02,790
He made the finals, and found
his America right here in Italy!

22
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,795
A big welcome to Enzo!

23
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,989
Keep up the applause
for the bride and groom!

24
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,496
Isn't she the most
beautiful bride in the world?

25
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,250
Tell me she's the most
beautiful bride in the world!

26
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,635
Today these kids have crowned
their dream of love.

27
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,135
Like me, when I left home
a long time ago.

28
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,015
My dream came true
and I hope yours do too.

29
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,019
Hold on to your dreams!

30
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,895
Never give up!

31
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,169
You're the best!

32
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,554
Enzo, my love!

33
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,397
Just look, what a chest!

34
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,569
What muscles!

35
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:06,198
You had hair when
we split up, now it's gone!

36
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,575
I know, it's your brains,

37
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,205
Honey, tell 'em about
when we were together?

38
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,961
Right, you're...

39
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,963
Now I have a steady girlfriend,
not with the same girl now.

40
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:26,592
- I'll never leave you.
- Give him a big hand I.

41
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,473
You're such a hunk.

42
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,981
What a hunk!

43
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:42,859
You gotta go on TV,
Luciano my boy.

44
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,365
What's wrong, sweetie?

45
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,745
She wanted Enzo's autograph.

46
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,373
She'll be mopin' all night...

47
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,251
Don't worry, want a photo?

48
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,258
Papa will get you one.

49
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,012
A big hand for the bride and groom!

50
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,975
Look at this beautiful bride.

51
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,145
She's the most beautiful bride
in the world!

52
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,492
Throw your hats in the air, c'mon!

53
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,031
You too down there, everybody!

54
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,660
Be happy,
these kids really deserve it.

55
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,999
Hold on to your dreams!

56
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,212
Could I get a picture of you
and my daughter?

57
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,466
Come on, sweetie, fast.

58
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,338
Like this?

59
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,220
This side here, right?

60
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,844
- How do I turn it on?
- Quick, please.

61
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,724
Your little finger like this.

62
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,479
Look how nice!

63
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,229
- How do I rewind?
- Okay, all set?

64
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,607
Want one too?

65
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,861
- Quick, we're in a rush.
- Take it, honey.

66
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,991
Okay.

67
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,278
- Where's he going?
- Home.

68
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,911
Where's his house?

69
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,165
- Far away?
- I don't know.

70
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,555
What do you want to tell us?

71
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,686
Can we give you
a good night kiss?

72
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,653
We gotta get an elevator in here.

73
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,204
An elevator! We could croak.

74
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,460
Faster, nephew, I can't stand this.

75
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,342
I got pains in my shoulder,
in my back.

76
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,681
Uncle, stop complainin'.

77
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,303
I'll drop you right here,
if you keep yakking.

78
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,703
What a racket climbin' these stairs,

79
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,124
you sound like
you carried Uncle yourselves.

80
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,252
- We're not so young, you know.
- Night, Luciano.

81
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,437
Maria, it's great.

82
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,899
- Like it?
- Yeah.

83
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,444
My daughter has one too.

84
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,700
It does everything.

85
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,541
Pasta, sauce...

86
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,952
It's great, really handy.

87
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,957
Maybe you'll buy one for yourself.

88
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,585
Wish I could,
I like it, it's really great.

89
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,840
Maria, wait,
there's this poor old soul.

90
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,347
- Not this month.
- Just one sec.

91
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,345
Michele!

92
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,980
I brought you Maria.

93
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,357
Go see Luciano at the fish stand
and get on the list.

94
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,114
Wait, how long's the list?

95
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,956
- Not long, he's first.
- He's really hurtin'.

96
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,117
Don't worry.

97
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,377
- Mrs. De Rosa?
- Teresa, they're callin' you.

98
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,754
Yeah, I heard.

99
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,384
- Nothin' yet.
- What?

100
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,977
Carlo, Ma's goin' out, lock the door
and don't let anyone in.

101
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:35,357
Everybody else got theirs,
I'm surprised you didn't.

102
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,145
Dunno, I never got it.

103
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,525
But Michele explained
once the deposit's sent in,

104
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,399
the robot comes automatically.

105
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,744
If it came, think I wouldn't say?

106
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,123
I almost called you this morning,
'cause I need the money.

107
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,492
And how! It's 100 euro!

108
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:02,008
Okay, but maybe you gave the
wrong address or you weren't home?

109
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,921
No wrong address.
Gotta run, I'm in a rush.

110
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,802
Mrs. De Rosa!

111
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,682
This is yours?

112
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,095
No, I saw you, ma'am.

113
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,477
Let me serve this lady here first.

114
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,225
One kilo.

115
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,570
Michele, see what Dora wants.

116
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,983
Half a kilo of shrimp for Filomena.

117
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,824
Hello everyone, hi Michele.

118
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,203
Here's yours
and this is for that lady there.

119
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,837
You can pay Michele.

120
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,874
Mrs. De Rosa didn't give me hers.

121
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,253
- What!
- They all gave me theirs.

122
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,256
Except Mrs. De Rosa.

123
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,012
They delivered them all except hers?

124
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,641
The guy's coming for them,
see what you can do.

125
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,017
Michele, get that 10 euro there!

126
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,644
Come here.

127
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,117
Sure, ma'am, don't worry.

128
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,778
Mrs. De Rosa didn't give us hers.

129
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,410
- How come?
- She's someone you brought.

130
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,626
That's strange, she's trustworthy.

131
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,593
Hello, Ma'am,
could we talk a minute?

132
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,223
Just for a minute.

133
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,558
Excuse me.

134
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,446
How come your robot
hasn't come yet?

135
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,117
Sonny, what can I say,
they made a mistake.

136
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,873
The courier says he delivered it.

137
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,126
They must have got mixed up.

138
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,625
- She says they got mixed up.
- Yeah, right.

139
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,632
- I say she's telling the truth.
- I don't believe her.

140
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,763
Have a little faith.

141
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,017
You got your robot too,

142
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,901
the courier delivered to everybody
so you have yours.

143
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,529
They probably
had the wrong address.

144
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,868
My cousin's sure,

145
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,281
so how can we resolve this?

146
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,408
When they bring it...

147
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,161
Do you have this robot
or did you sell it?

148
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,510
When they bring it to me,
I'll bring it to you.

149
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,796
Ma'am, you already have it.

150
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,177
Don't play dumb.

151
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,311
Okay, so let's go
to your house and see.

152
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:32,688
- We won't find a thing!
- Let's go see.

153
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,939
There's no point.

154
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,817
Got a guilty conscience?

155
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,820
If you have nothing to hide,
humor him.

156
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,325
Let's go outside and talk.

157
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,419
We'll talk outside
and then we'll go see.

158
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,456
Get her outside.

159
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,712
Maybe it's best.

160
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,091
We'll talk it over outside.

161
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,222
Please, do me this favor.

162
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:13,319
You're making a ruckus,
I'm friggin' fed up.

163
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,703
Luciano, where are you going?

164
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,080
Michele, you tell him!

165
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,116
What can I say?

166
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,828
No, I'm sick of this!

167
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,997
You gotta go, I have things to do.

168
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,501
- Get out!
- The lady's right.

169
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,503
Convinced now?

170
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,129
Thanks for your patience.

171
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,882
It's okay.

172
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,762
Get out, that's it.

173
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:00,400
Ma, I'm making pastries,
bread too.

174
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,362
I need that for the pastries.

175
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,165
Shame on you, ma'am.

176
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,508
I was wrong.

177
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,175
What happened to that one?

178
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,133
- It doesn't look so good, but...
- Doesn't look so good?

179
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,637
- Just dirt.
- It comes off.

180
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,806
Who can I give this thing to?

181
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:36,777
- Don't give me 500, just 250.
- No way!

182
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,818
- Don't yell.
- I'm not yelling.

183
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,445
Calm down!

184
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:46,571
My customers
want these things neat and clean.

185
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,949
Don't want it? Don't take it.

186
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,792
Michele, hold this.

187
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,455
- Pay me for four.
- Always the same old story.

188
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,166
- What can I give 'em now?
- Nothin'.

189
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,926
It's not my fault.

190
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,340
Here's 2,000 euro,
the rest tomorrow.

191
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,092
- We'll see.
- Four plus one...

192
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,849
- Five.
- Even he can count, see?

193
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:16,605
- Luciano, you always do this stuff.
- No, it's the first time.

194
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,231
The door.

195
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,233
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- I'll call you.

196
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,363
Happy now '2.

197
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,363
- See what you got me into?
- I don't know what to say.

198
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,495
Take it easy.

199
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,993
Forget your pay this week.

200
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,629
Goddammit, jeeze!

201
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:50,350
I'm job-hunting,
I have a degree in Economics.

202
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,388
- Why Big Brother?
- I may get noticed and become a CEO.

203
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,108
- It's important to dream.
- I agree.

204
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,650
- Next, 562.
- Hi, good evening.

205
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,027
- Name?
- Ambrosanio Roberto.

206
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,275
- What do you do?
- I study Business Administration.

207
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,618
And my passion's techno music.

208
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,907
- And why Big Brother?
- It makes you popular...

209
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,286
There's tryouts for Big Brother.

210
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,130
- Up there.
- Let's go see.

211
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,513
I play soccer.

212
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,301
- What position?
- Forward, in the D league.

213
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,552
From soccer to Big Brother?

214
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,431
Yes, you can earn more.

215
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,187
Not bad,

216
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,684
Thanks a lot, bye.

217
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,187
And now it's...

218
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,065
564.

219
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,317
Enzo!

220
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,078
Good evening.

221
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,086
- Name?
- Mariarca.

222
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,964
- Last name?
- Tagliamonte.

223
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,091
- From Naples, right?
- Near Naples, Portici.

224
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,344
Why Big Brother?

225
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:18,222
- To be rich and famous.
- Finally someone sincere.

226
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,349
- Lucia what?
- Magnotta.

227
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,730
- Born in...?
- Naples.

228
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,610
- On...?
- 26 March 1935.

229
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,370
- Sign here.
- You'll land me in jail.

230
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,373
- Nothin' will happen.
- What could possibly happen?

231
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:43,331
We make the first three payments,
nothin' will happen.

232
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,966
What have you got to lose?

233
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,342
My pension.

234
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,880
It's the only thing
they can't take from you.

235
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,887
- It's what I live on.
- Don't worry!

236
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,135
People die of worry!

237
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,266
Excuse me.

238
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,723
Papa?

239
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,526
You gotta come, there's tryouts
for Big Brother, even Enzo's here.

240
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:11,405
I can't, I'm busy,
I'd love to, honest.

241
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,028
Talk to Martina.

242
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:19,660
Papa, come on,
these guys can't do a thing.

243
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,247
I don't know, I'm really busy.

244
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,041
Get off the phone!

245
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,298
Put Mommy on, please, I'm busy.

246
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:35,049
Maria, what should I do?
I'm busy.

247
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,429
Nah, don't come and don't worry,
I'll handle this.

248
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,514
Maria, get him here.

249
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,684
Leave him alone, he's working.

250
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,030
You decide,
what do you wanna do?

251
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,193
What's he say?

252
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,580
Make him come.

253
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,676
Okay.

254
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,929
We'll be waiting, love you.

255
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,966
What did he say?

256
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,222
He's coming.

257
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,096
Let's go over this:

258
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,853
I send the papers to the factory,

259
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,978
they check them,
and send you the robot,

260
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:34,609
you call us, we pick it up
and give you your money.

261
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,446
How about an advance?

262
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,866
- How?
- Dig in your pocket and pay me.

263
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,497
I can't, I don't have any money.

264
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,496
Don't worry.

265
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,249
Fine, I gotta trust you
but you don't trust me?

266
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,093
If the robot doesn't come
what can I do?

267
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,511
If it comes and you give me nothing?
Do I whack you?

268
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,508
Don't give me the robot.

269
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,721
- I'll crack your skull with the robot.
- Just relax.

270
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,645
Be quick about it.

271
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,486
Don't forget to call us.

272
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,276
Geppina, ma'am, come in.
How are you?

273
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,497
I brought this poor soul,
let's give her a contract.

274
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,911
Geppina, I know you but,
no offense, ma'am...

275
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,919
- Is it okay with her?
- No problem.

276
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,627
She knows how it works?

277
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,425
- Okay, what's your name?
- Tucci Anna.

278
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,398
I'm here, Luciano's here.

279
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,067
- They've worn me out.
- I got held up.

280
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:57,032
Come here, what's this face?

281
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,449
Maria, I'm leaving,
I've got a headache.

282
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,576
- I'm tired out.
- Three hours.

283
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,451
They took it all down,
you can't audition now.

284
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,830
Why not?
Think I give up that easy?

285
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,461
What's wrong, sweetie?

286
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,962
That's my girl!
Want me to try out?

287
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,468
Can I always
have that smile if I do?

288
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,308
Okay, I'll show you.
Give me a kiss.

289
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,688
Enzo's there.

290
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,475
Be happy, why the long face?

291
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,738
Guys, a little faster please.

292
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,744
Don't push.

293
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,952
Everyone will get a shot.

294
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,124
Remember me, at La Sonrisa?

295
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,342
- No.
- Three weeks ago.

296
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,221
Tatiana, would you...
For my daughter.

297
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,348
Make it fast, guys.

298
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,515
Would you also...
for my son Vincenzo.

299
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:11,231
Dressed as a drag queen,
I played your girlfriend.

300
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,018
Blue wig... You remember?

301
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,021
Yeah, I remember.
I'm starting to remember.

302
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,526
I came to do a tryout
but it's all packed up.

303
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,782
It's been a crazy day...

304
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:28,412
You have to talk to the organizers
at that table there

305
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,659
and on the other side.

306
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,041
I don't organize these things,

307
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,416
tryouts were this afternoon,
they don't last all night.

308
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,168
I know, I'm asking a favor.

309
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,297
What can I tell you?

310
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,760
It's for my kids,
you must have a niece or nephew,

311
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,429
you know when they pester you.

312
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,558
Specially Alessandra, look at her,
she pulls your heartstrings.

313
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,941
“Papa, you got here late...

314
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,782
"“Want to bet I get a tryout?"

315
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,407
"“Show me."

316
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,576
Even faking it,
we can put a camera there.

317
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,948
I don't really care.

318
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,077
- Okay?
- Not really.

319
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,170
Get Beppe for me?

320
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,584
Guys, step back a little, it's hot.

321
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,841
Beppe, a favor, for this guy here,

322
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,343
he's good, worth it.

323
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:35,308
I know, it's breaking the rules,
but if we could audition him.

324
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,436
- Can you?
- If the camera's still around.

325
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,231
- It might be worth it.
- Get on the platform.

326
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,859
Never give up!

327
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,202
What the fuck's that mean?

328
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,868
Bring the camera for an audition.

329
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,212
- Your name again?
- Luciano.

330
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,339
- Last name?
- Ciotola.

331
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,625
- Where are you from?
- Naples.

332
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,594
- What do you do in life?
- I sell fish.

333
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,630
I run a fish stand.

334
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:11,226
- How come Big Brother?
- My kids pushed me.

335
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,014
If it works out,
so much the better...

336
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,141
Yes, hello, what is it?

337
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,806
Sure, of course.

338
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,440
In Rome? Sure, of course.

339
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,314
When, more or less?

340
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,070
Yes, I can go to Rome.

341
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,951
Alright, thank you.

342
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,700
So you'll let me know.

343
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,205
Okay, fine, goodbye.

344
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,691
They called me from Big Brother,

345
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,309
just now.

346
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,563
We're going to Rome
for an audition.

347
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,230
- Can I come in?
- Ma?

348
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,488
- Hello.
- Hi, Grandma.

349
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,827
I brought sausages
with broccoli, eggplant,

350
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,121
macaroni omelet.

351
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,872
I'll put it all in containers.

352
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,385
You look good, stop.

353
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,515
You've been at this all morning!

354
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,898
Of course, I have to decide
what to wear!

355
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,529
I'll wear my green pants,
you wear your white ones.

356
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,869
- And on top 7
- Something that matches me.

357
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,781
Mary, I don't know.

358
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,789
Wait.

359
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:52,505
This one's light, if we walk a lot
it won't stick to you

360
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,390
and looks good on you.

361
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,518
- I'm Luciano Ciotola.
- Here to see...?

362
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,106
Beppe Arena.

363
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,274
Have a seat,
we'll take you inside in a moment.

364
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,771
Thank you.

365
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,560
May I sit down?

366
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,329
Follow me, folks, we're going inside.

367
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,464
Where are the auditions?

368
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,839
- Follow me, you'll see.
- Not there.

369
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,846
They're taking me that way,
see you later.

370
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,667
I made a huge one before.

371
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,178
- Well '?
- All set.

372
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,146
I did like you said,
it was good advice.

373
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,142
I told them everything,
even about the past.

374
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,653
I'm still a little...

375
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,695
It was really terrific.

376
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:27,571
A psychologist helped me,
he began asking me questions...

377
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,667
you wanna know?
I started talking...

378
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,080
- Good for you, well done.
- We'll let you know.

379
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,337
That's the psychologist.

380
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,087
- Which one?
- This short guy here.

381
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,464
He helped me, he pushed me to talk.

382
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,222
You know, when I get going,
there's no holding me back.

383
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,225
The most incredible thing is

384
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,065
everybody else took 5-10 minutes,

385
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,727
and they kept me an hour!

386
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,812
I was awesome!

387
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,449
I said things
I never even told my Pa.

388
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,076
It was really amazing.

389
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,487
I bet they're still talking about me.

390
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,582
They said "Stop, that's just fine".

391
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,619
They looked at me like this.

392
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,712
- Stunned?
- Yeah, like this.

393
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,374
I shocked them.

394
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,754
Let's go, girls.

395
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,511
Papa said he'd do the tryout
and he did, see?

396
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,139
Yes, it was a real live tryout.

397
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,018
I blew them away!

398
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,399
They didn't say so,
but it's a sure thing.

399
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,117
Put Ma on.

400
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:56,244
You just can't imagine,
I shocked them.

401
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,916
They were stunned,
didn't say a word.

402
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,168
Put Aunt Rosaria on.

403
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,003
Auntie, you can't imagine!

404
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,314
Auntie, you gotta go on TV too!

405
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,065
Congratulations, lots and lots I.

406
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,850
Thanks a million.

407
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,194
Here you go, all the best.

408
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,357
I'm giving fish away today.

409
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,818
Don't worry.

410
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,243
Luciano's crazy this morning,
he's givin' fish away!

411
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,702
- Congratulations, are you happy?
- Thanks.

412
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:22,996
Did they call?

413
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:27,877
The call's comin' here,
the call's comin' there...

414
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:33,382
This is your last coffee
before you're famous.

415
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,601
- You're already in?
- In my head, yeah.

416
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,388
That's all?
I think more than that.

417
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,769
Vittorio, I always believed it.

418
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,893
Me too, but...

419
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,399
I always said, what are you?

420
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,858
- Somethin' else.
- Yeah, really somethin' else.

421
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,868
- And I believe in you.
- Me too.

422
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,154
Doesn't he belong in the House?

423
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:01,501
Once I'm in, will you organize
a fan club here?

424
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,912
Vittorio,
what did I say this morning?

425
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,418
- Exactly that.
- I'll handle it.

426
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,668
I'll put money on all the phones
so they'll vote for you.

427
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:13,047
Then see if you remember me.

428
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:17,134
- I don't wanna serve coffee forever.
- C'mon, Luciano, it's late.

429
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,895
- Hello, can I help you?
- Half a kilo of clams.

430
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,568
- They're squirting!
- They're alive.

431
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,535
Why do you keep them in water?

432
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,781
- To flush 'em out.
- We don't do that in Rome.

433
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,828
- You put 'em in wine?
- No, in nothing.

434
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,210
But they gotta flush out the sand,
clams live in the sea,

435
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:51,585
they get sandy,
so the water cleans...

436
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,589
- Anything else?
- A small sea bass.

437
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,845
I'm all out, how about
a nice red snapper?

438
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,180
Fresh this morning.

439
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:09,854
I never found any sand,
the water surprises me.

440
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,229
That's strange!

441
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,824
Hear that Luciano?
In Rome they keep their clams dry.

442
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,490
So, you're from Rome, ma'am?

443
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,960
- Did you weigh it?
- Just a second.

444
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:31,841
It's 3/4 of a kilo,
let's call it half.

445
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,631
What brings you here?

446
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:42,139
- Just wondering.
- My husband's from around here.

447
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,637
Naples?

448
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,264
This neighborhood?

449
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,224
Yes.

450
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:53,022
- It comes to 23.
- We'll make it 20.

451
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:57,150
- You're giving us a deal?
- Sure.

452
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,786
Well, goodbye and thank you.

453
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,035
- Maybe we'll be back.
- We're right here.

454
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:27,013
What I don't understand is
they were looking around.

455
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:32,686
It's like they were up to something,
whispering...

456
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,146
Did they ask questions?

457
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,941
No, I asked the questions.

458
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,694
One said her husband
was from Naples,

459
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,031
from near my fish stand,
but I've never seen them.

460
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:48,076
When you went to Rome,
did you say you had a fish stand?

461
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,577
Sure.

462
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,710
So they came to see if it's true,
to check.

463
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,089
- Check what '?
- To see what you do.

464
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,587
If you told the truth.

465
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:06,099
They send people to check you out,
to see if you're telling the truth.

466
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,724
Why me?

467
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,440
Maybe because they liked you.

468
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:15,479
Why didn't they say
they were from the TV?

469
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:21,360
Sure, you think they'd come
"We're from the TV."

470
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,454
Listen to your aunt,
she knows everything.

471
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,489
What do you think, Auntie?

472
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:30,209
What do I think?
That you shouldn't go.

473
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,625
- Yeah, sure...
- What did I say?

474
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,214
Do I have to agree?

475
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:41,505
I don't like that show.

476
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:46,844
Watching's one thing,
going on the show's another.

477
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:50,514
He has a wife and three kids,
you know?

478
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,608
If he wins Big Brother
he's set for life.

479
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,900
No way, he's not used
to all that money,

480
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,524
he'll spend it all partying.

481
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,151
- Think he's an idiot?
- He's responsible.

482
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:07,155
Auntie, I'd like to have the problem
of spending money.

483
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,491
- Rather than not.
- Right!

484
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,287
I want that problem too,
I'll help you.

485
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,499
It's better having money to spend
than not.

486
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,169
Auntie, different from you,
know how I see it?

487
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,675
A chance that happens
once in a lifetime,

488
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,758
they say luck only knocks once.

489
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:30,554
It's a chance, I'll try to grab it.

490
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:46,944
What is it?

491
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,202
Just lookin'? Take a walk.

492
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,459
You gotta leave, shove off.

493
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,212
How about giving me some?

494
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:08,049
What? Go away...

495
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:11,345
Are you deaf or something?

496
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,597
Go take a hike.

497
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,239
Still here?

498
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:31,706
- Don't you hear me when I talk?
- Gimme somethin'.

499
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,367
Get out of here!

500
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,283
Sasé.

501
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:56,450
Who was that man standing here,
well-dressed, bald?

502
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,833
- Where was he?
- Here.

503
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,415
- Maybe a customer.
- A customer?

504
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:30,988
I was mean to him,
I shouldn't have been, for 50 cents.

505
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:35,867
Good, sometimes you reflect right.

506
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,870
You're starting
to understand important things.

507
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,118
Repentance is important,

508
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,873
after doing wrong,
repentance frees the soul.

509
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:49,878
Yes, but they were watching me,
who knows what they think of me,

510
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,379
what they're saying.

511
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,382
What do you care?

512
00:55:55,644 --> 00:56:00,889
It's easy for you to say,
you're not being checked.

513
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:05,985
We all are,
we're all being observed I.

514
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,482
Our Lord observes us,
judges us, guides us.

515
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,277
Want to reconcile your conscience?

516
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:20,500
The next time you meet the poor guy,
give him 5-10 euro.

517
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,868
I made a mistake.

518
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,914
You can always correct a mistake.

519
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,919
Look how she's sleeping.

520
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,012
Lucia, ma'am?

521
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,882
Ma. Am T.

522
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,685
- She woke up.
- Who is it?

523
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:47,560
This is Luciano, I'm Michele,
for the robot.

524
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,063
We're here to pick it up.

525
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,067
Then you can go back to sleep.

526
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,576
Can I give you a hand, ma'am?

527
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,704
No, I can still manage.

528
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,561
Here it is.

529
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,349
Give me my money.

530
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,818
Better yet, keep it, it's a gift.

531
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,695
Asia?

532
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,736
If you didn't need it,
why did you have me get it?

533
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,694
I need the money,
give me my money.

534
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,743
Hear me?
I don't want to say it again.

535
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,114
Hold on, ma'am.

536
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:46,210
You're "giving without receiving",
but this is too much.

537
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,875
Give her the money
and take the robot.

538
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,754
- You get more this way.
- No, you gotta give me my money.

539
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,719
- Wait a minute.
- Let's go.

540
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,215
They're checking on us.

541
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:03,219
- You idiot, you owe me.
- The Finance Police?

542
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,516
Good god!

543
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,517
Thief, give me my money!

544
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:45,394
- Who ratted on us?
- I don't know, but they did.

545
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,397
- How?
- I don't know!

546
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,439
But they did,
those guys were watching me!

547
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,530
Good lord, Luciano...

548
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,571
what do we do now?

549
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:04,573
I'm even risking getting on the show.

550
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:09,828
I'll break your face,
I'm sick of this show!

551
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:15,208
We might get in trouble
and you're thinking about the show?

552
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,711
It's not nothing,
just think if I get on?

553
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,968
We're set for life,
all our problems solved!

554
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,092
- If you get on!
- I'll get on.

555
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:29,726
I'll get on that show, mark my words.

556
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,355
C'mon, you've really lost it.

557
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,609
I haven't lost it!

558
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:41,738
It's a chance, don't you see?

559
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,244
You're making my heart sink.

560
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,747
Tell me this,
you're focused on that show,

561
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:59,503
how can we get by without
our little trick, just selling fish?

562
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:04,010
- I thought something else.
- What?

563
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,634
I thought I'd sell the fish stand.

564
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:13,106
- Don't make me go berserk.
- What's it giving us?

565
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,602
- Money!
- What?

566
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:21,649
It's not doing good and besides,
I don't want to harp on it,

567
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:25,657
but once I'm on the show,
let's say I don't win...

568
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:30,283
when I get out,
with the money we make,

569
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:33,915
we can buy 1O fish stands,
100 or as many <i>as</i> you like!

570
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:38,041
Okay, when they call you,
we'll close the fish stand.

571
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,510
How can we, if I'm gone
for two or three months?

572
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:46,052
We'll close for two or three months,
when you get out, we'll reopen.

573
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,926
But I want to sell it

574
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,810
so we can fix up the house
with the money,

575
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,184
that way we'll look good
in the interviews.

576
01:00:56,194 --> 01:01:00,062
Besides, if you can't
keep fudging things when I'm gone,

577
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,407
how'll you and the kids get by?

578
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:09,281
Ever since I got this idea,
I feel good inside.

579
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:13,576
It's our big chance,
we'll solve all our problems.

580
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,579
I never had a goal before,

581
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,924
but since I got this thing,
my head's spinning.

582
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,712
I feel great inside, I feel awesome.

583
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,340
Please don't give up on me.

584
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,682
<i>C'mon.</i>

585
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:35,056
That's about it,
the fish tanks, the motor,

586
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,067
it turns on back here
and same over here.

587
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,979
The walk-in refrigerator.

588
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,242
I'm happy, but I'm sorry too.

589
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:58,625
Let's have a coffee.

590
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,242
Don't worry, Michele!

591
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:33,747
We'll open a bigger fish stand,
I'll let you run it.

592
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,999
Yeah, okay.

593
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:45,172
- Why did he sell it?
- We all said not to.

594
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:36,343
Uncle Luciano!

595
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,225
An unknown call.

596
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,850
An unknown call!

597
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,727
Your phone's ringin'!

598
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,357
Your phone's ringin',
an unknown call.

599
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,830
- The phone?
- Yeah, the phone, do I answer?

600
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,826
- No, no.
- Then hurry!

601
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:07,834
- How long did it ring?
- How do I know?

602
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,631
The time a phone rings.

603
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:14,381
- Why didn't you answer?
- You said not to!

604
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,726
I thought there was
at least a number.

605
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:22,641
“Unknown, do I answer?" "No."

606
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:25,897
- So I didn't.
- You mixed me up.

607
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,401
Yes.

608
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,547
Absolutely not, no problem at all.

609
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,680
Really?

610
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,148
Yay, they took me!

611
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,693
All Naples is celebrating!

612
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,572
Sorry, we're at the beach.

613
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:23,325
That's exactly why we took you,
you can see from your face...

614
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,331
that you're a real...

615
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,170
moron!

616
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,960
This is Big Brother calling...

617
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:37,339
I didn't lie,
I really am big brother.

618
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:41,473
Why are you being such a jerk?
Is that the best you can do?

619
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,720
You know how much I want this!

620
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:46,227
Don't make such a big deal.

621
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,602
- Is that all you know how to do?
- I was just joking.

622
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,230
Joking? Fuck off!

623
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,323
Don't talk like that.

624
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,610
You're being crude.

625
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:12,504
You know what it means to him,
you go making jokes?

626
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,198
Enzo?

627
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,043
- Who is it?
- Here, behind the grating.

628
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:39,961
Hi Enzo,
it's Luciano, remember? - No.

629
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:43,965
From La Sonrisa,
the mall, the audition, Beppe.

630
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,338
Right.

631
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:50,092
- What the fuck are you doing there?
- Don't ask, I had to.

632
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,094
- How did you get here?
- The air ducts.

633
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:55,688
It's okay.
I'm really sorry, but...

634
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,725
I tried another way,
but they wouldn't let me.

635
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:02,104
- You could have waited outside!
- I just couldn't.

636
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,572
I'm on the john, you have to leave.

637
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:09,703
Listen, don't tell me I did all this
for nothing.

638
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:15,242
The show's starting,
but no one's called me.

639
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,746
You scared me just to ask that?

640
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:24,130
Okay, don't worry,
if they liked you, they'll call.

641
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:27,004
Even at the last minute,
but they'll call.

642
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,011
- That happened to you?
- Yeah.

643
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,013
They called me at the last minute.

644
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:35,892
- So, there's still hope?
- Of course there is.

645
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:39,391
- You have to keep believing.
- I believe plenty.

646
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:42,019
- I've invested so much.
- You did good.

647
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,901
Keep believing, always believe.

648
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,652
- So there's hope right to the end?
- Sure.

649
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:54,407
You don't know
what a weight you've lifted, thanks.

650
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:57,910
- Never give up.
- Sorry for barging in like this.

651
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,412
- What do we say?
- Never give up!

652
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:02,414
Fuck off...

653
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,541
Security!

654
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,044
Don't you check the dressing rooms?

655
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,691
Let him talk.

656
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:36,074
Guys, this is a dream come true.

657
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:53,465
The evening's just begun,
it's going to be quite a night.

658
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:57,060
Let's see how they're doing.

659
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,221
Guys, can you hear me?

660
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:11,237
You're right to be happy because

661
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,612
you're the contestants
on the new Big Brother show.

662
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:24,746
Let's let them enjoy this moment

663
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,873
while I give you some big news:

664
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,250
The surprises are not over yet,

665
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:32,380
in fact, next week, on Big Brother,

666
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,132
another two contestants will join.

667
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:39,262
With incredible, moving stories.

668
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,481
People with incredible stories,
that's you!

669
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,523
He. S in!

670
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:54,242
Here we go again!

671
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:58,033
Luciano's not going in, get it?

672
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,782
He's already messed up enough!

673
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,535
- Calm down!
- Calm down?

674
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,413
Don't get so upset, Maria.

675
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,170
Why not, she's right, isn't she?

676
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,127
- What, you think she's wrong?
- Stop!

677
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:16,173
You're his ma, you should ask him
what the heck he's doing.

678
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:19,176
- I want to see him happy.
- Yeah, happy on the street.

679
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,806
Take it easy.

680
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,684
- Look what a mess you made!
- Cut it out.

681
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,651
I gotta cut it out?

682
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,712
Where have you been?
Come have a coffee.

683
01:13:54,931 --> 01:14:00,097
- No, thanks.
- All your friends are here.

684
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:04,475
- I'm busy.
- Just a minute, for your friends.

685
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,982
I looked for you in the House,
but I didn't see you.

686
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:17,238
Where were you, in a drawer?

687
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,486
They'll take you for sure.

688
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,614
Yeah, they'll reel you in!

689
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,700
Don't listen to them.

690
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:30,622
You're the best, if they don't
choose you, the show's over.

691
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,749
I'm sure of it.

692
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,505
Let's hope so.

693
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,665
Hi.

694
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,043
Want something to eat?

695
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,174
Don't be scared.

696
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:28,180
Ciro, give him something
to eat, okay?

697
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,648
What do you want?

698
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,151
- Some pizza?
- Give him this, and this...

699
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,437
This and more pizza.

700
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,821
And something to drink too.

701
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,917
- Give him a big one.
- You're sure?

702
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,288
Over here, eat.

703
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:55,961
Give him something to drink too.

704
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,093
This makes three, Vittorio.

705
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:08,219
Can you give him something to drink?

706
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:11,347
Brandy.

707
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:15,978
Give him some. What else?

708
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:20,611
Ciro, that bottle over there,
and this one here.

709
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,359
<i>C'mon.</i>

710
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,364
- I'm paying, Vittorio.
- Sure.

711
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:28,744
Don't worry Ciro.
Get another bottle.

712
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:34,080
And more pizza, more pastries.

713
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:35,997
Give him more pastries.

714
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,500
- More pizza?
- No, I'm all set.

715
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,752
Have a pastry.

716
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,473
This one.

717
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:49,014
Luciano, if he gets drunk,
you're taking him home.

718
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,103
Don't worry, he's my guest.

719
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,018
I'm so happy to see you!

720
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,325
That's my stuff!

721
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,708
Give me that, give me that lamp!

722
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:00,957
Come here!

723
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:10,467
Luciano, what are you doing?

724
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,847
Here, these are for you.

725
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,356
- What are you doing?
- It's okay.

726
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:28,860
- Okay?
- Just a little charity for the poor.

727
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,116
You're crazy!

728
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:34,741
Giving away our stuff
after all we've sacrificed!

729
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,373
- Put that down I.
- It'll all come back to us...

730
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:43,500
- Not once, but a hundredfold!
- No, not that chair, no!

731
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,212
Leave it there!

732
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,131
Put my chair down!

733
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,884
What's wrong, are you crazy?

734
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:57,890
- What are you doing?
- They're giving me a last chance.

735
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,390
Who?

736
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:03,144
The people from the show,
they said a hotshot's going in.

737
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,147
That's me, they're watching me,
trust me.

738
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:10,527
That's it! Understand?

739
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:14,156
I let you do all sorts of things,
but this is it!

740
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,407
You're sick in the head,
you need help.

741
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:21,793
You think TV's wasting time and money
on an fool like you?

742
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,416
Stop it, you're sick.

743
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,646
Give it to me!

744
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:49,657
Somethin' for me?

745
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:26,038
So you still don't get it.
Go, and don't come back.

746
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:31,293
You liked all that free stuff?
Go get a job!

747
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:35,046
Get out of here, and fast!
What are you looking at?

748
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,141
That's the one who got my lamp.

749
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,678
I'll give you something, alright I.

750
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:46,274
Hey, what's going on?
Don't listen to her, come back.

751
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,564
Get out!

752
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:53,068
Come back!

753
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,909
Get out of here!

754
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,414
Can't you see
they're sending them to me?

755
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,665
Sending them to you?

756
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:09,081
Excuse me, could you tell the TV
to stop sending you?

757
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,336
Don't be funny!

758
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:15,211
Will you get a grip?
It's all in your head, wake up I

759
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:20,050
I don't need to get a grip,
it's like I'm telling you.

760
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,427
What's the matter?

761
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:26,597
You gotta help me, he's lost it.

762
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,604
He has this thing
about the TV spying on him

763
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:32,820
so he's giving people our stuff.

764
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,325
She's lying! Sure, I gave
some things to the poor,

765
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:41,492
just a little charity.
Now look what she goes inventing!

766
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:43,614
So now I'm a liar?

767
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:48,461
- Just a little charity.
- Don't you start saying that too.

768
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:52,874
He thinks the TV's spying on him
so he's giving away our stuff

769
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,501
to make himself seem...

770
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,712
he's driving me nuts!

771
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,257
You don't understand me,
if that's what you think.

772
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:06,262
- You don't understand me at all.
- What's to understand '?

773
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,982
You're doing this
because you want to ruin me,

774
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:12,143
but I won't let you.

775
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:17,152
Then why's she inventing all this?

776
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:18,865
Calm down.

777
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:22,907
I'm not coming back, it's over.

778
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:27,375
- Go then, if you want to ruin me.
- Hear that?

779
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:30,787
I said go, if you want to ruin me.

780
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,168
She wants to ruin me,
but I won't let her.

781
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,921
Come down here, talk to her.

782
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:07,073
Everything okay?
Forget about her.

783
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:11,160
That's the way she is, sorry...

784
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:14,334
Come on in.

785
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:16,332
Something to drink?

786
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:54,704
Uncle Luciano?

787
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,644
Still not ready? Get moving.

788
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,641
Come here.

789
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:17,984
Look.

790
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,604
- What's that?
- A cricket.

791
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,401
Look how it moves!
Come and see, Auntie.

792
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,153
Look at that.

793
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:31,032
Do you think it's normal
having a cricket in here?

794
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,660
I've never seen one inside the house.

795
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:35,627
How'd it get in here?

796
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:38,914
From the window.

797
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:43,420
Right, but did you ever see a cricket
in this house, or anywhere here?

798
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:47,051
- Not me.
- Never inside.

799
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:49,516
And so, it's strange.

800
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:54,680
Let's open the window
and let it out.

801
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:58,400
A waste of time, it's not leaving.

802
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:01,278
Let's go, it's late.

803
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:04,064
I'll catch up with you.

804
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,698
- He's not coming?
- He'll be here.

805
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,014
Excuse me, ladies,

806
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,178
I can't go on like this.

807
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,928
This is getting to be too much.

808
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:01,148
- What's the matter?
- Just tell me, yes or no.

809
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:06,438
I keep giving things away, but still
no call about getting into the House.

810
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:08,568
What call?

811
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:12,572
If I have to do more,
just tell me and I'll do it.

812
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:14,574
What should I do?

813
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,949
Be patient, don't rush things.

814
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,076
I have plenty of patience,

815
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:25,335
it's just that I've invested
everything to get into the House.

816
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:30,587
Only death has no remedy,
everything else works out.

817
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:34,841
- You want to get into that house?
- Yes.

818
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,717
- Then you will.
- You say so?

819
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:41,848
Surely, you need to have
faith and hope.

820
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,566
Don't worry.

821
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:49,105
- You say I have to go on like this?
- Of course.

822
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:52,483
Don't worry.

823
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,614
Good luck.

824
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,270
Auntie.

825
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:35,117
Don't just stand there,
let's go down and see Unc.

826
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,406
Why are you looking at me like that?

827
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:52,168
Is he eating?

828
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,045
Not much.

829
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:59,391
He's parked in front of the TV
night and day.

830
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,519
He's depressed.

831
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,690
It's useless beating around the bush,

832
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,444
you love him
or else you wouldn't be here.

833
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,942
You came because you want to be here.

834
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:19,449
Yeah, he matters to me.

835
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:24,659
This won't last,
things like this never do.

836
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:28,704
He'll get up from the TV
and you have to be here.

837
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,338
Don't jump on him when he talks,

838
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:37,421
let it go in one ear
and out the other, okay?

839
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:43,302
Then come up here
and let him talk to himself.

840
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:49,225
He needs you.

841
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:57,858
She'll go 1.

842
01:30:58,453 --> 01:30:59,739
Let's get going.

843
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,078
Give us a smile.

844
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:09,745
Look at these nice fritters,
he loves them.

845
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:11,746
Are they hot?

846
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:15,459
Let's go.

847
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:25,886
Luciano, there's a surprise for you.

848
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:30,482
Come and see who's here.

849
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,239
So, he's kept giving away stuff?

850
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,685
Luciano!

851
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:34,330
- Maria! How is he?
- He's at home.

852
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:36,832
It was a real blow.

853
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,552
But he's tough, he'll get over it,
have him come see us.

854
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:46,721
- Hi, how are you?
- Can't complain.

855
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:49,095
- Coffee?
- No thanks, I'm in a hurry.

856
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:50,725
Say hi to Luciano.

857
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:54,475
How is he doing?

858
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:57,356
He's doing therapy,
little by little...

859
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:01,198
I could tell he was losing his mind.

860
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:05,327
Losing his mind?
Careful what you say!

861
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:08,743
He's just a little down,
he hasn't lost his mind.

862
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:12,247
He'll get better
seeing a psychologist.

863
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,748
What psychologist?
A doctor! It's different.

864
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,626
Say hi, tell him I'll come visit.

865
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:23,128
Don't worry, he'll come see you.

866
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:25,130
Bye.

867
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:29,601
It's official, he's lost it.

868
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,911
Look how he moves!

869
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:59,543
- See him?
- Yeah, he's dancing.

870
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:03,044
Ever see me dance?
Isn't that my dancing?

871
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:06,926
- You're saying it's just like that?
- That's my dance!

872
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:09,675
You can't be
the only one who dances like that.

873
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:13,304
Look how he moves, those steps!
Ever seen me dance?

874
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:17,808
Did you invent that dance?

875
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:20,060
Remember when
I went for the tryouts?

876
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:24,069
The things I said,
know what they did, those bastards?

877
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,568
They took what's me
and gave it to them.

878
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:31,071
So, they stole your ideas.

879
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:34,575
- You don't believe me?
- Could be.

880
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:37,536
But you're overdoing it.

881
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:42,587
You're all against me now,
just because I went a little off.

882
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,337
Why don't you believe me?
You weren't at the tryout,

883
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:48,588
I'm the only one
who knows what I said.

884
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:52,597
I'm willing to believe you,
but you're overdoing it.

885
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:55,687
- You're willing!
- What do you care?

886
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:59,850
You've got this nice family,
a wife, kids...

887
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:04,230
You're hurting them, they see you
sprawled on this couch all day.

888
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:07,482
It hurts me hard.

889
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:10,235
It hurts that they copied me.

890
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:13,243
You don't care, but I do.

891
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,866
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

892
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:18,869
What we care about is you.

893
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,081
And I care about all of you, so?

894
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:27,507
What can I say?

895
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:30,131
He's a little depressed.

896
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,966
It might be the medication.

897
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:38,014
It's not the medication,
it's Luciano who's changed.

898
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:41,020
Laying on that couch night and day.

899
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:46,522
- What does the doctor say 7
- That it's the Big Brother shock!

900
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:48,773
“Be patient,

901
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:52,403
"when the show's over,
your husband will recover."

902
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:55,122
So, it won't last forever.

903
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:58,413
I don't believe that anymore.

904
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:04,415
I can't take it, I'm really down.

905
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,040
I know.

906
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,544
I've tried everything,

907
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,763
I confront him, he gets aggressive,

908
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:14,925
I go along with him and it's worse.

909
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,511
I don't know what else to do.

910
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:22,899
Don't take it so hard.

911
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:29,693
I can't do this anymore.

912
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:35,074
- I'm scared.
- Hush...

913
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:38,281
I'm scared!

914
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:42,286
What if he stays like this?

915
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:45,706
Don't even say that.

916
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:51,591
I know someone who could help.

917
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:56,801
He's always comforted me
in hard times.

918
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:00,349
I'll talk to him.

919
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:03,599
Luciano has to feel our love,

920
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:06,105
love always triumphs.

921
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:12,357
Today we'll read a powerful
passage from the New Testament.

922
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:17,738
Here Jesus asks us
to understand ourselves,

923
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:21,746
to understand the difference

924
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:24,954
between being and seeming,

925
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:28,001
between what's true and false.

926
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:33,254
This is the only way
to understand our limits,

927
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:35,380
our capabilities.

928
01:37:36,142 --> 01:37:39,976
If we don't know ourselves,

929
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:43,388
we'll never have the strength

930
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,520
to face life.

931
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:51,276
But if we learn these things,
we get closer to ourselves.

932
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:53,528
Often, we run after appearances

933
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:56,402
and lose ourselves,
and that's not good.

934
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:00,531
It's not by chance

935
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,624
that someone
knocked at our door today,

936
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:06,287
a friend of ours

937
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:09,164
who's having a tough time.

938
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:13,669
He's asked for our help,
to be part of our community.

939
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,886
He's a richness for us.

940
01:38:16,641 --> 01:38:19,258
We'll help and sustain him.

941
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:27,182
- Bread.
- Meatballs too.

942
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:28,933
Meatballs!

943
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:32,563
- Another slice of chicken?
- Alright.

944
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:54,588
- Hi, Luciano.
- Hi.

945
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,055
- How are you?
- Fine.

946
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,926
- More?
- Just a little.

947
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:05,474
Pasta? Michele, give him some.

948
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:08,057
Give that woman some chicken.

949
01:39:18,244 --> 01:39:19,860
Cheese.

950
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:34,715
Papa, when will you be back?

951
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,755
When will I be back?

952
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:39,755
Tomorrow.

953
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,136
