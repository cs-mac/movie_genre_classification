00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,759

00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,314
Fucking Shit!

5
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:59,257
Hey, bastard! I cannot have shower,

Pay July, August and September

00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,146
- Yes, your fish is ready.
- Thank you.

10
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:08,534
- How was it?
- Thanks. It was good.

11
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:11,784
- You paid that, right? 
- Of course.

12
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:13,904
What about drinks?
Don't you finish them?

13
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,829
We need to drive. 
Good night.

14
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:18,219
Lucia, beer is ready!

15
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,043
Give me a glass of wine
you stranger bastard.

16
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:23,486
I love you too, Sokrates.

17
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:25,325
Ya, ya, ya.

18
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:38,147
- Hi.

19
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,627
Nadine, I am on my way. 
I am sitting in the car now.

20
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:43,314
I don't believe you. This is my last night
and you are missing it. 

21
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:45,613
I was busy in restaurant.
You can start to eat.

22
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:49,354
All, all, all the time
Zinos, do you realize?


23
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:51,980
Happy for you. You will get 
rid of me in the morning.

24
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,498
Bastard.

25
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:57,640
You decided to go,
Nadine! It was your idea!

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,290
Nadine.

27
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:11,654

00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:40,498

37
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:43,195
Will you cut the crap?

38
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:46,939

00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:51,330
I will wait... Thomas Neumann

42
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,746
- One more serving for young man.
- No need serving.

43
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:23,290
Food will be finished, 
that's it.

44
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:26,205
- Mistress Krüger.
- Hello Zinos.
- Mister Krüger.

45
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:30,469
What does this mean? Can't you 
sit straight?

46
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,669
- What can I do for you?
- I want to have a hot gazpacho.

47
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:46,260
- I need to ask chief first.
- Chief's opinion doesn't interest me.

48
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,044
Sure.

49
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:56,421
Chief... We have a problem.

50
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,572
It's taste is different
than your's, right?

51
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:17,330
- Asking Espresso?
- Yes.

52
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,882
Hmm... Super.

53
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:23,175
- She wants to go Shanghai and 
eats dog meat - Mother please.

54
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:26,103
- Don't worry grandma, I never forget anyone.
- If so, come with me.

55
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:28,877
- We have argued about it for thousand times.
- We can have one more then.

56
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:31,989
You want to argue? Ok lets argue then. 
First: It is your plan..

57
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:35,101
- It is my job. - Quiet
- What about my job?

58
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:36,765
Quiet!

59
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:43,268
Continue to eat.

60
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:47,551
I just want to have hot gazpacho
from the lady. That's all.
What's the big deal?

61
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:51,962
Gazpacho is a traditional spanish
food which is served cold. 


62
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,683
Don't you have a microwave in the kitchen? 

63
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:57,555
Do I come to your place of work,
and teach you how to do your job?


64
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:01,269
- I want to have a hot gazpacho!
- No!

65
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,189
- I can cum to your soup! 
It will also get warm! - Shayn it is enough!

66
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:08,779
This is the last time. I don't want 
you here anymore. Out!

67
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:13,767
Ya, ya! You sell everything you 
can sell, don't you? Love, Sex, soul... 

68
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,894
- Also Traditions!
- Get your traditions and fuck off!

69
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:19,544
Get out! You are fired!
It is enough!

70
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:22,202
I am sorry.

71
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:25,695
I am go out to smoke.

72
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:35,623
What will you do now?

73
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,246
Voyager...

74
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:40,848
...haven't reached his 
destination yet. It is not over.

75
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,140
- Take care.
- Chief!..

76
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,406
...Hasta luego!

77
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:48,113
Good luck.

78
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:57,721
Hey Man!.. I like your foods!

79
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,964
Do you have a 
job for me? 

80
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,564
I fear.

81
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:16,609
Are you staring again 
Nadine? It is enough.

82
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:20,406
Flight fear, Zinos.
Flight fear. You know.

83
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,566
Ha...

84
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:24,416
...sorry.

85
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:26,214
Very bad?

86
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:27,908
I don't know.

87
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,514
Yes.

88
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,107
You stink.

89
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:09,179
Look. It is very easy.

90
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:13,070
You call me from Skype.

91
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:20,338
Then, you click this 
little webcam icon

92
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,557
...and we can see eachother. 
- I don't want to just see you 

93
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:26,468
I want to feel you, smell you.

94
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:29,634
If I want to smell you, I could smell fryer. 

95
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:31,406
Smell this.

96
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:33,062
Mint.

97
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:36,748
- Do you understand now?
- Everything, everything.

98
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:40,639
- It is better, if you write.
- Later.

99
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,627
Zinos...

100
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:47,248
...there is no later.

101
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:50,433
Ah this legs, Ah. 

102
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:54,234
What can be done with this foot?
These beautiful foot?

103
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,817
Ah, look at this ass!

104
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,093
Nadine?

105
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:03,444
Nadine!.. Shit.

106
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:52,535
Kazantsakis!

107
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:54,731
Lets go then.

108
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:58,778
- Hey Illias! Want to play? 
- Okay.

109
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,935
Þnik, þnak, þnuk!

110
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:05,538
Suck this mate.
Your dept become 35 bucks.

111
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,454
- Need to pass from here?
- No need. Go on.

112
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:14,193
- Sign here.
- Okay.

113
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,100
You will be here at 6 o'clock, right?

114
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,094
But, I can be late for half hour... 
Just kidding.

115
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:46,079
- Howdy malaka?
- Illias, what are you doing here?

116
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,739
- Did you escape from prison?
- Escape? What next. Everything is fine.

117
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:53,719
How are you? You seem good. Lost weight. 

118
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,083
Sit. I need to talk to you. 

119
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,073
sit, sit.

120
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,063
Now...

121
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:01,718
I need a favor.

122
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:04,021
What you want? You want me to hide you? What happened? 

123
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,854
Everything is all right. The thing is: 

124
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,869
They let me go out from prison for 
a limited time. So I can go out weekends. 


125
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:11,034
- It is really good.
- It is good but...

126
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:14,915
...the point is: If I would have a job, 
I could go out everyday. 

127
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:19,058
- But You have never work.
- I will pretend to work.

128
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,590
- I see. How long does it for? 
- Half a year. Until the end of my prison time. 

129
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,939
- Forget it. I have enough workers here.
- But Zinos, you are not listening to me.

130
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,348
I am saying that I will pretend to work here.

131
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,028
Listen.

132
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:38,133
All you need to do is 
signing this paper. 

133
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:44,298
Work starts 17:00, endss 02:00

134
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,938
But this is wrong. 
I am closing at 12.

135
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:49,589
Doesn't matter. No matter 
what is written there. 

136
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,128
My hero. Aren't we brothers? 

137
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:04,229
- How do I move motorcycle? 
Good morning chief. - Morning. 

138
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,527
Haa, one more thing, don't 
mention about the prison to anybody.

139
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,891
- Why?
- there will be rumors.

140
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,649
I am leaving.

141
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:18,334
Ah... One more thing. 
Can you give me twenty bucks? 

142
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,099
Thank you very much.

143
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:31,761
Thanks.

144
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,410
Your welcome.

145
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,712
- Was it your Brother?
- You can say. 

146
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:44,053
My brother will work
here for a while. 

147
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:47,718
I don't understand... How is the 
meaning of hiring one more waiter? 

148
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:50,831
He is happy to work 
just for unemployment money. 

149
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:52,657
He needs job.

150
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:56,243
He is taking unemployment money 
and wearing suits, isn't he?


151
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:58,608
Why this dishwashers are so heavy? 

152
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:01,524
It was bought from Greece, that's why. 

153
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,100
Okay.

154
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,449
One.. Two.. Go!

155
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:11,001
- We are really weak for this.
- You are! 

156
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,237
Chief, is this a good idea?

157
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,553
I will beat you.

158
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:22,230
Zinos?

159
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,929
Chief, are you alright?

160
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,422
What happened? Lucia 
can you come here?

161
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:28,821
Lucia!

162
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,830
- Who will cook the food? 
- I will.

163
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,062
- You cannot. You should go to Doctor.
- I cannot go fucking doctor. 

164
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:36,485
Wait a minute. Why can't 
you go to doctor? 

165
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:39,933
- I don't have insurance, that is because! 
- Hey Zinos!

166
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,474
Stick a rod to your ass.

167
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:45,785
He, he. Pay your rent first, old man. 

168
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:49,765
Zinos, will you pay our shifts? 

169
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:52,582
I will take care of them.
Okay?

170
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:30,085
Nadine?

171
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,469
- Zinos?
- I can see you.

172
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,858
It is unbelievable. 
It is like science fiction.

173
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:38,439
I can't see your face, sit please.

174
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,202
I can't sit. My back is fucked.

175
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:45,157
- Is it because of running at work?
- I don't know.

176
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:47,384
It hurts.

177
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:49,216
Ahh. poor thing.

178
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:53,078
- Can you see me now?
- Yes.

179
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:56,664
If your back is serious, you should go Anna

180
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:59,292
- Who is Anna?
- Physiotherapist.

181
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:02,425
- Wait, I will send you a link.
- Send it.

182
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,263
Eee?

183
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:08,441
You became an 
oversea journalist now? 

184
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,760
Yes.

185
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,060
This is stupid.

186
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,134
I am touching a plastic screen, 
not your face.

187
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,084
Better then nothing. 

188
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:24,271
I know what is better.

189
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,616
Come close.

190
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:30,200
I will move to Shanghay, to you.

191
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,441
What about your restaurant? 

192
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:41,220
I will hire a manager.

193
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:45,059
We will see.

194
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,837
I am buying all of these.

195
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:12,500
Hello?

196
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,734
- Good morning captain.
- What's up?

197
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:19,827
- I am looking for Zinos Kazantsakis
- He is sick.

198
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:23,018
Sick? Ok then. 

199
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,220
- Who is the owner of this place? 
- Sick one.

200
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,948
Take care chief!

201
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:09,202
Do you have prescription?

202
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:12,072
- No.
- Did you see a doctor? 

203
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:14,421
Not exactly.

204
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,640
I fear.

205
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,797
Lean forward.

206
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:23,072
- Ah. This is the end.
- Okay.

207
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,812
It can be hernia.

208
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,662
It is bad?

209
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:29,840
If it is, yes it is bad.

210
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:31,692
How can we know?

211
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:34,889
MR can show it, but doctor 
need to write prescription. 

212
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:36,603
Shit.

213
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,306
I can show you some 
moves, can be relaxing. 

214
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:42,215
- What is your job?
- Cook.

215
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:45,682
You can't work as 
a cook in this situation.

216
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:47,144
Why?

217
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:49,340
Standing for a long time can be harmful. 

218
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,035
Sitting too. 

219
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,847
You need to walk a lot. Always in motion 

220
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,910
Don't lift heavy things. 
1 Kilo maximum. 

221
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,449
- Okay?
- Okay.

222
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:02,594
Dancing can help to decrease your pain

223
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,033
- Dance?
- Hmm-m.

224
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:25,719
This is fantastic. 

225
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:29,670
A real Roman coffeehouse.

226
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:33,717
They will destroy to come. 

227
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:36,934
Tell me chief. 
Do you want to hire this place? 

228
00:18:37,054 --> 00:18:39,496
I know everything about restaurants so that..

229
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:42,471
...I am aware of that 
I don't want to manage a restaurant.

230
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:44,286
Hawaii steak.

231
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,637
Meatball.

232
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,869
Fish in oven.

233
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:50,067
Spaghetti with cream sauce.
Spinach with cream sauce.

234
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:52,629
Fried Potatoes
with cream sauce.

235
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,741
I won't cook this shit. 

236
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:57,494
You were looking for a job. 

237
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,924
Whore is who you are looking for.

238
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:02,222
I am a cook. 

239
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,008
I see. Door is there. 

240
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:18,618
Hey, wait a second.

241
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:22,528
I don't like these foods either,
but people like them.

242
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:25,502
They don't have a taste. 
They have a hole in the stomach. 

243
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,427
And they fill 
this hole with shit

244
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:29,219
System's working like this. 

245
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:31,624
Are you an opportunist?

246
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:33,858
No, but how can I pay my bills?

247
00:19:33,978 --> 00:19:35,823
This place is not a gourmet temple. 

248
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:37,690
It is what it is.

249
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:54,078
Sell out.

250
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:57,526
Things can't be sold, can be sold. 

251
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,035
Fake Passions.

252
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,135
One illusion.

253
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:03,311
Optical illusion.

254
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,372
and filling.

255
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:06,785
Here:

256
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:08,461
45 Avro.

257
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:11,620
Great. Can we put this in menu? 

258
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,401
There are 40 kind of food in the menu, 
and everyone of them tastes same. 

259
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:21,022
I will make 4 kind of food, 
with same money. 

260
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:23,128
Food for Soul.

261
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:24,592

00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:27,674
Yea man.

264
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:29,350
Hello?

265
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,456
We are not open yet.

266
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:33,861
Good morning.

267
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:35,985
- Are you chief?
- Yes

268
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:40,702
Schuster, Hamburg internal revenue office. 
Do you know that you have tax depth? 

269
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,463
- Do you have cash?
- Do I look like a bank? 

270
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,293
Can I see your wallet?

271
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:47,596
Do you want to sit down 
and drink something first? 

272
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:50,735
We are not thirsty.
Show me your wallet.

273
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,668
No.

274
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:57,618
Wait a second. You can't do it. 

275
00:20:57,738 --> 00:20:59,044
Don't take the music set.

276
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:00,611
Music is a food of soul.

277
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,348
We will come 3 weeks later. 
We will be hungry next time. 


278
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:07,892
This is a robbery. 
I know my rights, alright?


279
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:10,437
You can't do this to me!
- Hey Zino!

280
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:14,523
At last, 
your bumbum music is gone!

281
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,547
You bastard.

282
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,109
Hey Chief, what's up? 

283
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:37,671
...Chief's soup. 
What is the name of this? 

284
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:39,597

00:21:44,478 --> 00:21:45,783
Taste very well though.

288
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,615
- No, not today.
- As you wish.

289
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,813
Why nobody orders food?

290
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,606
Ask them.

291
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:02,621
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear guests:

292
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:06,917
Could I ask 
why don't you order food? 

293
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,487
Cut the crap old fart. 
I want my schnitzel


294
00:22:10,607 --> 00:22:12,255
- Same here
- What about my meatball?

295
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,626
Where is my pizza??

296
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:15,887
You can find your pizza in next place.

297
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:17,416
Supermarket.

298
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:21,494
Peasant don't eat 
what they don't know, right?

299
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:24,730
Taste fascist! 
All of you are taste fascist

300
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:27,567
It is unbelievable.

301
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:31,269
Eat that shit yourself!

302
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:35,600
You are a yearly customer, 
and what they have done to you!

303
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:44,287
Nadine, please 
take off the towel.

304
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:46,444
Zinos, I need to leave in 10 minutes. 

305
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:49,064
Doesn't matter, take off.

306
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,257
I am coming now.

307
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:10,058
Is it that fast?

308
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:37,663
Milli!.. Goat!... Me-e-e-e!

309
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,514
- Me-e-e-e.

310
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,351

- Fine.

311
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:46,988
Illia.

312
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:49,646
- So? How was it?
- Everything! Everything is done.

313
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:13,487
Darling, can you give me a beer?

314
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:15,818
Take yourself.

315
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:18,998
Would you like too? 

316
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:20,905
I haven't finished mine.

317
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,568
Is is possible to flirt with you?

318
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,792
Don't mess with me.

319
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:45,365
- So, What happened?
- Nothing.

320
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,517
All listen me!

321
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:53,904
Go Home!

322
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:55,785
What is going on mate?
We've just arrived.

323
00:24:55,905 --> 00:24:57,827
Illias, get out.

324
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:02,567
Stand up, let's go.

325
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,224
Are we going to Dollhouse?

326
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:06,516
Let's see some real woman.

327
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:08,466
What are you looking at?

328
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,642
I can't even pay your money.

329
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,029
Let's call it for today.

330
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:14,129
Just for today? 

331
00:25:14,418 --> 00:25:16,250
or forever? 

332
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,311
I will call you.

333
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,647
Lucia, give me a break 
and leave please. 

334
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,776
Lutz, Lutz!

335
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:37,201
Are you deaf?

336
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,070
Take your violinist and get lost.

337
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:42,190
- Don't you like it?
- Not today!

338
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,673
Ok, ok.

339
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:52,589
Hey, close the door!

340
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:14,727
Soul Kitchen!

341
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:17,077
Neumann... What are you doing here?

342
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:19,639
It seems like your place rocks. 

343
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,689
Poker is played here, right?


344
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,403
Sometimes.

345
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:27,331
What's up?

346
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:29,010
Don't you serve a drink? 

347
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,437
Of course.
What you would like to drink?

348
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,929
- Break Beer.
- It is coming right now.

349
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:40,169
Is this the old view of this place? 

350
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:42,057
It was, when I bought it.

351
00:26:42,177 --> 00:26:44,298
- It was a bargain, right? ?
- Yes

352
00:26:44,418 --> 00:26:46,590
Do you want to see what I bought?

353
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,574
Sure, Why not?

354
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:54,379
What is wrong man?

355
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:56,478
Want me to hand-job?

356
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:58,876
My back hurts when sitting.

357
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:01,418
Did you jerk off a lot?

358
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:12,332
- where are you taking me?
- You will see soon.

359
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,145
Take a look at these places. 
Look, look.

360
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:19,230
All block is belong to me.

361
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,619
- So, Is it your place?
- Not exactly.

362
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:23,463
I rent it.

363
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,870
I rent it to girls and some boys. 

364
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,028
Until building is collapsed.

365
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,549
Good.

366
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:32,362
We can fuck if you want. 
Two for you, two for me. 

367
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:33,914
It will be good for your back.

368
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:37,827
- Doctor Neumann ha?
- Doctor Neumann, exactly.

369
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,876
- What's up Tschako?
- Neumann. Do you have wave on you? 

370
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:42,901
- Always.
- Hello.

371
00:27:44,615 --> 00:27:46,118
Hello.

372
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:48,140
- So?
- What do you have?

373
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,583
Will you sell your place to me?

374
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,579
I can rent you, 
just like this place. 
375
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:58,560
I don't want to rent.
I want to buy it.

376
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,158
Tell me a price.

377
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,162
I really don't think to sell the place. 

378
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,563
It is my place, you know? 

379
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,374
I build it myself. 

380
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,647
I installed the pipes.
Build the toilets..

381
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,792
I picked up the tables 
and chairs from junkyard. 

382
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:14,028
- It has intangible value for me.
- Okay Okay. Mine has intangible value for me too. 

383
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:15,277
If you change your mind...

384
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:16,895
...my offer is always 
available, Okay? 

385
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:18,128
Okay.

386
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:21,040
Good afternoon.
Health Department?

387
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:22,845
Yes. How can I help you? 

388
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:24,833
I have a complain. 
Food poisoning. 

389
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,466
From Soul Kitchen.

390
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:27,486
Where?

391
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:28,626
Soul Kitchen.

392
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:30,691
Soul... S-O-U-L
Kitchen

393
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,878
Just like Kitchen of soul, Soul kitchen.

394
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:34,973
Industrial area, Wilhelmsburg.

395
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:36,869
I ordered cheese bread. 
It was stale.

396
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:38,870
It was Green mouldy 
and hard like rock. 

397
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,673
There was insects everywhere etc. 

398
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:42,878
It was more like zoo, then restaurant!

399
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:44,080
We will take care of it.

400
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,329
Please. It is urgent.

401
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:48,440
This is illegal.
You should close this restaurant. 

402
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,743
You need to search for another job. 

403
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,408
What?

404
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:56,579
Are you nuts? 

405
00:28:56,828 --> 00:28:59,370
Do you know how hard was that 
to get a job permission?

406
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,572
I am sorry.

407
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:02,236
Tell me another.

408
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:03,758
Why do you fire me?

409
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:05,961
I don't fire you.

410
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:08,754
I am going to Shanghai, to Nadine.

411
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:14,939
- What happens now?
- I am looking for a renter.

412
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,461
Or a manager.

413
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:19,736
- Why don't you ask me, prick? 
- Management?

414
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:22,699
Do you know What this mean?
This means working.

415
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:26,012
You didn't want to work, did you? 
You wanted to pretend to work? didn't you? 

416
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:34,488
Good morning.

417
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,627
- Are you owner?
- Yes. What's up?

418
00:29:37,747 --> 00:29:39,496
Meyer. Health Department.

419
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:41,730
- Oh shit...
- What?

420
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,395
Come in.

421
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:46,976
Off, off. This place stinks.

422
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,641
Where is exhauster?

423
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:55,477
Oh my dear!
This place needs to be a kitchen. 

424
00:29:55,597 --> 00:29:57,949
You need to floor tile, not carpet. 

425
00:29:58,069 --> 00:29:59,144
Also to the walls.

426
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,113
We don't buy kitchen tools from porcelain seller. 

427
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,679
Stainless steel... Steel.

428
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,778
Remove the gas tubes. You need to have 
orderly installed gas connection.

429
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:08,803
Else, your building will blow up. 

430
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:12,236
Off, off... Look at this electrical connections.

431
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:14,458
My boy, my boy,
My boy, my boy!

432
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:17,906
I will come 1 month later.
Everything will be fixed. Chiko?

433
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,083
Chiko.

434
00:30:19,203 --> 00:30:21,240
Else, I will close the restaurant.
I warn you.

435
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:30,354
Is Coffee machine ready? 

436
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:38,058
Good morning Zinos.

437
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:40,006
- In the left.
- Okay.

438
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:42,722
- Who are they?
- We are kicked from studio.

439
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,753
- Will practice here? 
- I thought that it will be Okay. 

440
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:47,448
Lutz, lutz.

441
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:51,493
What about renting the restaurant? 
You do what ever you want. 

442
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:54,948
How much money for?

443
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,093
Forget it. Bad idea.

444
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:02,559
- Can we practice anyway? 
- Be my guess.

445
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,735
Some fans will come too. 

446
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,364
- I am hungry!
- What?

447
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:22,321
This, third food from up. 

448
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:24,911
- Where are you showing? 
- I want this food. 

449
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:27,805
Problem is: 
Chief is not here now. 

450
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:30,289
I is not my problem! I am hungry. 

451
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,316
Nadine. This thing will
be longer than I expected. 

452
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:35,203
I know. Same everytime. 

453
00:31:35,323 --> 00:31:38,613
Nadine, you don't know it. 
Place is fucking me.

454
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,337
Place, place
Place, place

455
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:43,265
Yes, place, place
place, what did you expect?

456
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:45,615
Hey Zinos. They want food.

457
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:48,550
- Fix them something.
- They want from the menu.

458
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,418

00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:51,882

461
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,992
No, talk now.

I will call you my love. Please.

463
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,666

464
00:32:19,412 --> 00:32:21,529
Don't mix the kitchen! 

465
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,500

466
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:48,417

- No cheating!

477
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,770
Are you blind?

478
00:33:34,655 --> 00:33:36,254
What are you looking at?

479
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:50,649

00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:02,346
Time to go home!
Everyone! Everyone!

483
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,143
So? Do we go 
to the party? 

484
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,666
- Now?
- I will come too.

485
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:23,711
- Don't you need to return to the prison? 
- I have two more hours.

486
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:26,992
- Have you told something to her? haven't you? 
- No. - Are you sure? 
- I haven't told anything.

487
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:28,957
- What are you talking about? 
- Nothing!

488
00:34:29,077 --> 00:34:31,680
Oh my god. This place was used 
to be Karstadt, wasn't it?

489
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,683
- It was Karstadt.
- I know.

490
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,686
- Does it become a disco?
- It seems so.

491
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:39,834
- It is absolute that there is 
no absolution, which is even not absolute.
- Is it a proverb? 

492
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,586
It is my word.

493
00:35:04,492 --> 00:35:06,097
Goethe said:

494
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:09,086
"Colors are light's
monument and misery."

495
00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:12,312
That is because 
Van Gogh get crazy and...

496
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:14,523
...cut himself ear.
Do you understand?

497
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:16,070
Of course, sure. I know. 

498
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,757
Good then.

499
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,737
You like music, right? 

500
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:10,257
What happens to us 
if there was not a music?

501
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:22,011
Hey, dude. Dude!

502
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:26,546
All of these buttons. 
How do these works, can you tell me? 

503
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:27,592
Don't mess with me.

504
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:28,857
What did you say?

505
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:31,037
Fuck off, groin louse!

506
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,002
I need to go. I am leaving.

507
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:43,131
- Why? Do you have a date?
- I have things to do.

508
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,979
Milli, listen.

509
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:59,050
Call Goat now
and come here.

510
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,788
I will give you the address. 
I need a favor from you. 

511
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:11,665
Hey Zinos!

512
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:16,525
You asslickers!

513
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:18,482
What did you say?

514
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:28,673
Are you alright?

515
00:37:32,763 --> 00:37:35,142
- Who are they? 
- Some man.

516
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:37,005
They know your name, don't they? 

517
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,517
I have a bad reputation.

518
00:37:38,637 --> 00:37:41,036
Ah don't be ridiculous. 
You can't have that much reputation.

519
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:42,703
Tell me what is going on? 

520
00:37:42,823 --> 00:37:44,660
I can't!

521
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,121
- Don't you trust me?
- This is not about trust!

522
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:48,832
What is this about?

523
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,485
Alright! Don't tell me!

524
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:58,673
- Wait couple seconds Lucia!
- Get out of my face!

525
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,000
Look...

526
00:38:02,027 --> 00:38:03,231
Never Mind.

527
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:04,332
Heeey!

528
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:19,179
Okay.

529
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:21,745
But this is a secret.

530
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,007
Noone should know about this.

531
00:38:26,316 --> 00:38:28,132
My brother is a prisoner.

532
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:31,566
Like the Count of Monte Cristo?

533
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,546
So so.

534
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,421
He is a thief, burglar.

535
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,589
king of the thief.

536
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:39,511
He climbs to roofs...

537
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:46,342
Hamburg's truss.

538
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:49,624
Hot plates

539
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,772
This is so romantic.

540
00:38:55,776 --> 00:38:58,108
Hey, give two more!

541
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:03,781
Yes Lucia. Time to sleep!

542
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:04,753
Aloo!

543
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,812
Aloo!

544
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:14,019
Taxi!

545
00:40:08,902 --> 00:40:10,261
Alo?

546
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:11,550
I am.

547
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,410
Do you remember?
Girl friend in Shanghai.

548
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,663
Nadine.

549
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,378
You promised to call me?

550
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,397
Something came up.

551
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:23,941
Rush, bustle.

552
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:27,222
- You forget me so.
- I definitely not.

553
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,093
- I miss you.
- Me too.

554
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,404
What happened to you? 
Why are you moaning?

555
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,572
My back.. It got fucked.

556
00:40:36,403 --> 00:40:37,833
What was that sound?

557
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:39,977
A boat.

558
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:41,923
Where are you?

559
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,669
In Speicherstadt.

560
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,692
I returned from 
a party in Speicherstadt

561
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,188
What? Is that why 
you don't call me?

562
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:52,762
You forget me because of 
having fun with some girls?

563
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,818
- You told me that you are coming here?
- I will.

564
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:57,037
Come here then!

565
00:41:29,063 --> 00:41:30,035
Nadine?

566
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,649
Zinos! I am falling in love man.
Love! To Waitress girl... Pam!

567
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:40,125
Okay, relax.

568
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:42,516
Didn't you tell her 
about prison, did you?

569
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:44,485
Me? No.

570
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:45,842
Did you?

571
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,635
No. Never.

572
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,849
Malaka, I am so happy,
You can't believe.

573
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:52,041
I will call you later, Okay?
See you.

574
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:53,731
Okay. bye.

575
00:42:00,564 --> 00:42:02,216
This is unbelievable.

576
00:42:03,013 --> 00:42:03,915
Unbelievable.

577
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:06,857
How could you rent this place?
Are you rich or something?

578
00:42:06,977 --> 00:42:08,298
No.

579
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:10,595
I live here illegally.
I even don't have a bathroom.

580
00:42:10,715 --> 00:42:12,695
Where do you shower??

581
00:42:12,815 --> 00:42:14,090
Swimming pool.

582
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,540
Like the old days?

583
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,410
Yes.

584
00:42:19,866 --> 00:42:21,881
Tell me Lucia.

585
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,440
- Can I ask you something?
- Whatever you want.

586
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:32,167
What about managing my restaurant?

587
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:33,858
As manager of Soul Kitchen.

588
00:42:33,978 --> 00:42:35,862
Where does it 
come from now? 

589
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:38,006
I need to go to Nadine.

590
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,533
What do I do with a restaurant? 

591
00:42:41,653 --> 00:42:43,912
I want to make my 
own way and painting. 

592
00:42:44,032 --> 00:42:45,401
I want to be free.

593
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,334
I can't manage a restaurant.

594
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,601
I will sell it then. 

595
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:52,335
No. Don't do it.

596
00:42:56,332 --> 00:42:58,218
Ask your brother.

597
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:06,486
Alo?

598
00:43:06,743 --> 00:43:07,786
Kazantsakis.

599
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:08,782
Neumann.

600
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:10,688
Yes it is. Tell me, 
what's up? 

601
00:43:10,808 --> 00:43:12,104
What is what?

602
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:13,902
Don't you sell your place?

603
00:43:14,022 --> 00:43:15,911
Ahhm..I can't talk
right now.

604
00:43:16,031 --> 00:43:18,415
- Line is disconnecting.
- What line man?

605
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:21,771
- I don't understand what you saying.
- Call me. It is important.

606
00:43:26,846 --> 00:43:28,496
It is tickling.

607
00:43:40,672 --> 00:43:42,491
Can I face down? 

608
00:43:43,391 --> 00:43:45,294
This exercise is 
important for you.

609
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:52,077
I am sorry.

610
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:53,464
I am so embarrassed.

611
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,331
You should be happy.

612
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:58,047
You are healthy.

613
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,537
What is happening here?

614
00:44:13,657 --> 00:44:16,312
I don't want stolen equipments in here. 
They are trouble.

615
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:19,040
What is wrong with you? She likes 
the music, and I like her. 

616
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,232
Take these back. You will 
take these back today.

617
00:44:21,352 --> 00:44:22,873
Goat, Milli! Take these back.

618
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,110
Immediately!

619
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,527
Who are these people Lucia
Where do they come from?

620
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:32,059
There is an opening of musical school 
across the street. They are celebrating 

621
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:33,898
Musical.

622
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:37,873
My prediction was true. They will even 
eat your hairs in your head. 

623
00:44:38,694 --> 00:44:41,108
Start the music. Quick.
Girls should dance.

624
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:43,112
Girls should dance!
I don't know about these records.

625
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:45,248
What is these buttons. 
What is these? 

626
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:47,943
Can it be this?

627
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,295
Play this! Play this!

628
00:44:51,415 --> 00:44:53,123
- Which song?
- three, three, three.

629
00:44:55,115 --> 00:44:56,721
Which button?
Which button?

630
00:44:56,841 --> 00:44:59,158
33! 33!

631
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,119
This is better.

632
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:05,416
- Good, right?
- Yes.

633
00:45:05,888 --> 00:45:07,610
Go on, semis up, semis up.

634
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:03,564
Stainless steel, stainless steel, 
stainless steel.

635
00:47:03,684 --> 00:47:04,951
Chiko?

636
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:06,135
Chiko.

637
00:47:31,576 --> 00:47:33,123
One second, let me pass.
Thanks.

638
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,298
Can I pass?
Thank you very much.

639
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:38,771
Thanks,
Thanks.

640
00:47:39,544 --> 00:47:41,630
I need to go to the 
table at front. Thanks.

641
00:47:42,814 --> 00:47:44,923
I am coming right now.

642
00:47:45,884 --> 00:47:49,083
Hey! Who made this?

643
00:47:56,635 --> 00:47:58,534
Get out!

644
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,397
Illias!

645
00:48:00,655 --> 00:48:03,596
Hey! The Count of Monte Cristo!
We need help in the bar.

646
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,932
- What did you say?
- We need help in the bar.

647
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,747
No. Before that?

Damn! I think
I pierce the bilis.

Fucking ass!
Take out your hands of it!

I don't believe. You 
messy bastard! Ratty!

655

It is impossible!
You idiot!

656
00:48:39,172 --> 00:48:41,540
Clean the place!

657

- Illias gone!
- What happened?

658
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:47,715
Prison thing, 
got out of my mouth.

659
00:48:48,934 --> 00:48:50,903
Sorry.

660
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:56,680
You will return.

661
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,321
Okay man.

662

Ali! Ali Davidson!
Run! Clean the kitchen!

Doesn't matter!

00:49:03,424 --> 00:49:05,917
- Neumann! - Why don't you call?
- Did you see my brother? 

665
00:49:06,037 --> 00:49:08,428
- What on earth do I know. 
We need to talk. - I will be right back.

666
00:49:08,548 --> 00:49:11,863
I liked old

I don't want to come here.

672

What are you saying?

673
00:49:29,872 --> 00:49:33,464
Next week, I need to fly 
to Lhasa, and report 
every week for 6 months. 

674
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:35,702
This means, I can't see you 
even if you come here. 

675
00:49:35,822 --> 00:49:37,847
Don't worry, 
I will handle it

676
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:40,249
Zinos, You don't know Chinese. 
It is not easy.

677
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:42,771
What is wrong with you?
You wanted me to come there. 

678
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:44,341
I did, but not now.

679
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:48,127
Listen. This project is 
very important and 
I can't get this chance again. 

680
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:49,580
One second.

681

Tell me a price.

685
00:50:13,614 --> 00:50:14,973
Work is good at restaurant.

686
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:16,309
Really good.

687
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:19,250
Look. I don't care about work. 
I will destroy the building anyway.

688
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,698
I am interesting for land.
Now... Okay, or not? 

689
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:25,569

What is your problem?

What is my problem? 
In fact, What is your problem?

699

Why did you tell 
her about prison ha?

Come on man. This 
was romantic for her. 

701
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:24,418
romantic?

702
00:51:26,968 --> 00:51:28,796
Do you know how romantic is it?

... 2.5 years with some bastards, 
sitting in the same cage?

When you out, noone 
will give a job to you...

705
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:37,207
...Do you know 
how romantic is that?

706
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,212
Telling lie to your own mother, 
working in a oil platform... 

707
00:51:40,332 --> 00:51:42,572
...do you know how 
romantic is that?

708
00:51:42,692 --> 00:51:44,438
It is not romantic 
at all, mate!

709
00:51:44,558 --> 00:51:48,399
I am ashamed, do you understand?
I feel ashamed!

- What?

711
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:57,297
I want you to be 
manager of Soul Kitchen.

712
00:52:13,044 --> 00:52:15,001
Man, could you give me
one more 20 bucks? 

713
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:16,067
Sure.

714
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:30,235
Which permissions do you 
want to give your brother? 

715
00:52:31,477 --> 00:52:32,884
Full permission.

716
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:34,055
Are you sure?

717
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,071
What kind of question 
is that "are you sure?"?

718
00:52:36,191 --> 00:52:38,274
Do I look like egg thief? 

719
00:52:38,394 --> 00:52:40,433
- No Mr...
- Kazantsakis.

720
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:43,609
Kazantsakis. You don't look 
like egg thief at all.

721
00:52:43,729 --> 00:52:45,882
But, why full permission?

722
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:46,890
Look.

723
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,389
I will fly to Shanghai tomorrow. 

724
00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:52,834
I don't want to fly for 15 hours
for every little problem.

Just for one sign, etc.

you can move here.

- Jacket? 
- Hmm.

01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:40,698
Thomas Neumann.

810
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:42,866
Neumann... Okay..

811
01:02:41,998 --> 01:02:44,119
- Good luck young man.
- Thanks.

812
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:06,291
Nadine?

813
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:14,218
What are you doing here? 

814
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:15,706
To Shanghai, I was coming for you.

815
01:03:18,401 --> 01:03:20,089
My grandma died.

816
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:21,261
What?

817
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:23,182
Died.

818
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:30,810
My mother is waiting outside now. 

819
01:03:31,419 --> 01:03:32,696
I have to go.

820
01:03:32,816 --> 01:03:35,511
Nadine wait. I will take my luggage
and come with you.

821
01:03:35,631 --> 01:03:37,316
By the way, I am Han. 

822
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:45,105
I changed my mind.

823
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:47,461
Take my luggage. 
I will stay in Hamburg. 

824
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:49,793
- Flying ticket? 
- Here.

825
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,280
- Can I get them?
- One minute pls.

826
01:04:11,316 --> 01:04:14,034
This is clearly 
a hernia situation. 

827
01:04:14,257 --> 01:04:15,089
What now?

828
01:04:15,209 --> 01:04:18,780
We open your back. Take the hernia, 
and finish the surgery. 

829
01:04:19,905 --> 01:04:22,319
Do you have private insurance? 

830
01:04:22,439 --> 01:04:24,687
- I have no insurance.
- It will be very expensive. 

831
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,198
I can tell this much. 

832
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:30,455
What if I don't take the surgery? 

833
01:04:31,296 --> 01:04:33,933
If not, hernia will get bigger and.. 

834
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:37,273
...you will have to use wheelchair.

835
01:04:38,463 --> 01:04:41,451
..This is Nadine's answermachine.
Your message...

836
01:04:47,657 --> 01:04:50,275
Yes ladies. Beer was for you, 
right? - Yes, thanks. 

837
01:04:50,395 --> 01:04:52,907
- Do you like it?
- Delicious. 

838
01:04:53,027 --> 01:04:56,086
- Ali Davidson. Dishes
- I'm going.

839
01:04:57,117 --> 01:05:00,422
- How can I help you?
- Liquor for lady.

840
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,261
- Hard one?
- Yes

841
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:06,178
- Kazantsakis' brother!
- Aaa. - Neumann.

842
01:05:06,298 --> 01:05:08,779
Neumann, right.
Do you want to drink something?

843
01:05:08,899 --> 01:05:11,592
- Break beer.
- Sure. Coming.

844
01:05:18,071 --> 01:05:20,321
Can I sit? 

845
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:23,028
You should play than.

846
01:05:23,148 --> 01:05:25,137
Sure, sure.

847
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:29,661
- How much money?
- 50 cent. We are coin people. 

848
01:05:29,781 --> 01:05:33,153
Here Shayn. Good work. 
Thanks.

849
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,640
Let's play.

850
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,082
By the way, I am Thomas.

851
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:39,886
- Milli.
- Goat.

852
01:05:40,718 --> 01:05:43,085
- Give money.
- Don't you have?

853
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:46,987
You owe me 10 bucks anyway. 

854
01:05:47,107 --> 01:05:48,991
You strip me.

855
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,893
Best one are these.
Once a day.

856
01:05:56,013 --> 01:05:58,928
- Can I get glass of water?
- These are for chew.

857
01:05:59,268 --> 01:06:00,592
I said one!

858
01:06:00,712 --> 01:06:04,260
..Nadine's answer machine.
Your message...

859
01:06:05,678 --> 01:06:07,343
- 15
- 15 right?

860
01:06:10,612 --> 01:06:11,714
All in.

861
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,788
I am leaving chief!

862
01:06:14,105 --> 01:06:15,769
I am in.

863
01:06:16,636 --> 01:06:18,183
I see.

864
01:06:18,303 --> 01:06:20,283
Lets open then.

865
01:06:20,694 --> 01:06:21,889
So?

866
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:25,862
Damn.

867
01:06:26,096 --> 01:06:27,163
Damn.

868
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,436
Great man, great!

869
01:06:29,556 --> 01:06:31,662
This is my night mates.

870
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:33,408
It was a good play...

871
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,482
wait, wait. Give me one more chance

872
01:06:35,602 --> 01:06:37,533
Just you and me.

873
01:06:39,689 --> 01:06:41,025
Thousand Avro.

874
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,709
- Are you crazy man? Fuck it.
- Fuck it man.

875
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:45,127
Stop, stop.

876
01:06:45,247 --> 01:06:46,111
Fuck it man.

877
01:06:46,231 --> 01:06:48,267
Hey! I am leaving.

878
01:06:48,856 --> 01:06:51,598
Let's go man, 
let's have fun at Dollhouse.

879
01:06:51,718 --> 01:06:54,669
Let's go. Are you crazy? 
That is enough.

880
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:55,749
Let's go.

881
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,753
Wait a second.

882
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:02,218
- Go on, thousand Avro.
- Wait, wait.

883
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:03,378
Lucia!

884
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:05,077
Hey Lucia!
Wait please.

885
01:07:05,197 --> 01:07:06,308
Wait!

886
01:07:06,428 --> 01:07:08,288
I don't want to wait.

887
01:07:08,408 --> 01:07:11,513
You have to be in prison in two hours, 
and instead of fucking me, 
you are playing gamble.

888
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:14,420
Look. I am on my lucky day.
I need to use it today. 

889
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,928
I don't like it.

890
01:07:17,185 --> 01:07:18,427
Come here.

891
01:07:18,547 --> 01:07:20,080
Come here.

892
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,791
Listen.

893
01:07:25,412 --> 01:07:28,166
I will enter inside and 
play one more hand. I will win. 

894
01:07:28,286 --> 01:07:31,377
I will make rich both of us 
and return to you. Okay? 

895
01:07:31,497 --> 01:07:34,017
- Okay. Don't wait me. Okay?
- Okay.

896
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:37,356
Thanks.

897
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:42,360
Guys, we are closed. 
You can fly by your planes now.

898
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:45,442
- We are friends of Neumann.
- Neumann's?

899
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,493
- All of you?
- All of us.

900
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,867
...I am out. Please leave 
message after sign...

901
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:54,363
Nadine?

902
01:07:54,715 --> 01:07:56,601
I am in front of 
your mother's home. 

903
01:07:56,721 --> 01:07:58,933
I am waiting you near ducks. 

904
01:08:08,356 --> 01:08:09,692
All in.

905
01:08:12,082 --> 01:08:13,489
I see.

906
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:15,196
Yes.

907
01:08:15,316 --> 01:08:16,184
Let's do.

908
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:19,103
- Take out trousers. Tak!
- Okay man.

909
01:08:24,882 --> 01:08:27,272
Great Neumann!

910
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:33,319
Depth became 50.000.

911
01:08:34,303 --> 01:08:36,401
Okay?
or continue? 

912
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,739
Give me one more 
50.000 credit!

913
01:08:49,122 --> 01:08:50,495
No problem.

914
01:09:11,645 --> 01:09:13,039
Nadine.

915
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,284
Hey Nadine!

916
01:09:22,714 --> 01:09:24,987
Hey! Wait me!

917
01:09:27,378 --> 01:09:29,440
When I was a child...

918
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,819
...speak like a child...

919
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:33,846
...think like a child...

920
01:09:34,072 --> 01:09:36,038
...decide like a child.

921
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,498
After becoming a man, 
I left my childhood behind. 

922
01:09:40,512 --> 01:09:45,106
Now, just like looking at the mirror, 
we look at a dark word

923
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:49,219
But, we look face to face. 

924
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:53,098
For now, I can just 
recognize pieces of a whole

925
01:09:53,218 --> 01:09:57,545
In due time, I will 
recognize how I am recognized.

926
01:09:58,577 --> 01:10:01,330
For now, I have 
these 3 things remained:

927
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:02,598
Faith...

928
01:10:02,718 --> 01:10:03,559
...hope...

929
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:04,954
...love.

930
01:10:05,188 --> 01:10:06,841
This three thing.

931
01:10:06,961 --> 01:10:08,610
But the biggest one is...

932
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,063
...love.

933
01:10:10,183 --> 01:10:14,226
Nooooo!

934
01:10:24,246 --> 01:10:25,007
Nadine!

935
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:27,961
Fucking pig!

936
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:51,083
Don't worry about
other things Mr. Neumann.

937
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:54,587
In couple of weeks, 
contract will be legal.

938
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:24,045
What the hell 
are you doing here? 

939
01:11:24,165 --> 01:11:25,616
I live here. 

940
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:27,303
Watch out!

941
01:11:30,737 --> 01:11:32,248
I will bring cloth.

942
01:11:49,209 --> 01:11:50,229
Quickly.

943
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:51,354
Quick.

944
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:56,498
Damn.

945
01:11:58,795 --> 01:12:00,388
Why aren't you in Shanghai?

946
01:12:00,658 --> 01:12:02,392
Why aren't you in prison?

947
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:06,248
Why aren't you in prison?

948
01:12:06,517 --> 01:12:09,840
I will tell you later. 
We need to leave here. Quick!

949
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:28,764
Who is watching the place!

950
01:12:28,884 --> 01:12:30,416
I am not.

951
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,984
Where are you going? 

952
01:12:46,104 --> 01:12:47,502
Restaurant.

953
01:12:47,622 --> 01:12:50,033
Wait. what will you do there? 

954
01:12:50,716 --> 01:12:52,497
Place is still mine, 
isn't it? 

955
01:12:52,617 --> 01:12:55,617
Leave me boat, 
you rats!

956
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,691
What are you doing, 
bastards?

957
01:12:57,811 --> 01:12:59,484
What you want
motherfucker?

958
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,873
I am the owner of this place!

959
01:13:02,993 --> 01:13:04,924
Neumann is the owner of this place!

960
01:13:05,044 --> 01:13:08,135
Corbie! you better 
fuck out of my face! 

961
01:13:09,645 --> 01:13:11,262
Go on.

962
01:13:11,661 --> 01:13:14,168
Situation was very difficult 
and cost me very expensive. 

963
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,489
I invest a lot of money. 

964
01:13:16,724 --> 01:13:18,809
Come to the point Mr. Neumann.

965
01:13:18,929 --> 01:13:20,450
The point is:

966
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,685
You are not the only buyer.
As you know.

967
01:13:23,805 --> 01:13:26,075
You need to increase your offer. 

968
01:13:26,395 --> 01:13:28,399
What is your offer? 

969
01:13:28,519 --> 01:13:31,715
- Where is that motherfucker?
- Right... Turn right.

970
01:13:35,335 --> 01:13:37,726
Personally, I don't 
want to talk about money. 

971
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:38,616
Here.

972
01:13:38,736 --> 01:13:41,769
What are you up to, Tommy? 
What are you up again?

973
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:43,858
Talk, trickster!

974
01:13:43,978 --> 01:13:45,651
"Good afternoon" should be said at first. 


975
01:13:45,771 --> 01:13:46,869
Good afternoon. What now?

976
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:50,901
A Psycho crowd claimed
that place is your's!

977
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:55,262
Your brother, didn't 
tell you anything?

978
01:14:08,731 --> 01:14:11,122
Sorry... I'm...

979
01:14:11,427 --> 01:14:14,802
but I am sick, sick!
Understand me? I am sick!

980
01:14:15,165 --> 01:14:18,400
I am not a thief or something! 
I just paid my gambling depth!

981
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,001
You judah iscariot! Traitor! 

982
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:22,759
Bastard traitor! 

983
01:14:22,879 --> 01:14:25,270
You are zero! Zero!

984
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,250
A huge zero!

985
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:28,551
Sorry.

986
01:14:28,671 --> 01:14:30,496
Zinos! Forgive me!

987
01:14:31,246 --> 01:14:33,824
Tell me something!
Tell me something.

988
01:14:46,473 --> 01:14:48,313
Ahhh! It was good!

989
01:14:49,984 --> 01:14:51,625
I am dying.

990
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,476
Tell me.

991
01:14:53,711 --> 01:14:55,539
Notary told that...

992
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:59,089
Place ownership will become 
legal after couple of weeks. 

993
01:14:59,209 --> 01:15:00,367
Will it?

994
01:15:00,487 --> 01:15:02,631
Ye... Yes. I think 
he did.

995
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:05,677
Did he or not? 

996
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:07,435
He did. He did.

997
01:15:10,561 --> 01:15:12,928
Neumaaaann!

998
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:16,291
We go to Neumann first.

999
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,897
Don't we go to the Notary first? 

1000
01:15:18,017 --> 01:15:20,194
Doesn't matter where we go. 

1001
01:15:20,314 --> 01:15:22,397
Why doesn't matter? 
I need to know where to drive! 

1002
01:15:22,517 --> 01:15:25,165
Stop! Which one is more important? 
Notary or Neumann? 

1003
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:27,087
Neumann! Neumann!

1004
01:15:27,207 --> 01:15:29,091
to Neumann! to Neumann!

1005
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:49,851
Right! Turn right!

1006
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:56,589
- Next door!
- Here? - Yes!

1007
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:58,031
Here it is!

1008
01:16:01,795 --> 01:16:03,799
Milli! Goat!
There! Let's go!

1009
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,393
Hey! Put them back!
We didn't agree on that!

1010
01:16:22,261 --> 01:16:23,820
I found it! Found it!

1011
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,519
Good! Let's get out!

1012
01:16:31,162 --> 01:16:33,230
Cops! Coops!

1013
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:34,379
Damn!

1014
01:16:34,499 --> 01:16:37,097
Go run! Ruun,
Fuck!

1015
01:16:39,749 --> 01:16:42,597
- Come one man! Move!
- I can't! My back! You run!

1016
01:16:43,335 --> 01:16:46,241
- Don't move!
- I can't anyway. I have hernia!

1017
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:48,866
Raise your hands, on head! 
Do it!.. Do it!

1018
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:55,369
We lifted some weight ha? 

1019
01:16:56,505 --> 01:16:59,060
- Walk!
- Don't be hard on me please. 

1020
01:17:08,723 --> 01:17:10,223
Hey! Hey!

1021
01:17:11,489 --> 01:17:13,246
I am on this robbery too!

1022
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:19,329
Good evening! 

1023
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,137
Drive!

1024
01:17:28,192 --> 01:17:30,617
What will I say to 
my mother and father now? 

1025
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,453
Tell the truth.

1026
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,559
They are too old 
to hear the truth. 

1027
01:17:41,632 --> 01:17:44,703
I think I will tell them 
that I extend my contract.

1028
01:17:44,984 --> 01:17:46,437
Which contract?

1029
01:17:47,093 --> 01:17:49,285
Oil Platform job contract. 

1030
01:17:54,701 --> 01:17:55,791
Kazantsakis?

1031
01:17:55,911 --> 01:17:57,338
- Which one?
- Which one? 

1032
01:17:59,272 --> 01:18:00,936
- Zinos.
- Him.

1033
01:18:01,217 --> 01:18:03,057
You can go.

1034
01:18:18,657 --> 01:18:20,942
prosecutor will let you know Mr. Kazantsakis.

1035
01:18:21,062 --> 01:18:22,501
Take care of my brother. 

1036
01:18:22,621 --> 01:18:24,916
Take care of yourself.

1037
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:33,048
Damn. Damned!
Everything is massed up!

1038
01:18:33,974 --> 01:18:34,841
Anna!

1039
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,493
- Zinos.
- My leg is paralysed, Anna!

1040
01:18:36,613 --> 01:18:39,027
- All my leg is paralysed!
- Hey. What is going on here?

1041
01:18:39,566 --> 01:18:41,418
Excuse me please.

1042
01:18:41,538 --> 01:18:42,915
Get the fuck out!

1043
01:18:43,035 --> 01:18:45,047
I can't argue about it, Anna! 

1044
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,382
Come. Come with me. 
I know what to do.

1045
01:18:47,502 --> 01:18:50,183
- Where are we going? 
- Trust me.

1046
01:18:50,303 --> 01:18:52,565
I want to know where 
are you taking me. 

1047
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:56,092
You will come with me to that man, 
or you need a surgery immediately. 

1048
01:18:56,212 --> 01:18:57,349
Which man?

1049
01:18:57,469 --> 01:19:00,478
A physiotherapist.
Alternative Medicine.

1050
01:19:00,598 --> 01:19:04,307
He learned this from his father. 
His father from his father, 
and his father from his father...

1051
01:19:04,427 --> 01:19:07,389
I got it, Okay.
What is the name of the man?

1052
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:10,486
Turkish people called him 
Bonebreaker Kemal. 

1053
01:19:10,606 --> 01:19:12,868
What they call?

1054
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:28,539
Thanks.

1055
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:31,082
Don't you have a german newspaper?

1056
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:44,090
Everything will be alright.

1057
01:19:59,204 --> 01:20:00,575
Next!

1058
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:01,642
Anna.

1059
01:20:02,347 --> 01:20:03,859
Can you come with me?

1060
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,035
I don't think I will like this. 

1061
01:20:10,155 --> 01:20:11,172
Hosht!

1062
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:15,086
Hoyt!

1063
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:19,522
- How do I fall in this situation? 
- Zinos, you need to relax.

1064
01:20:19,642 --> 01:20:21,842
If you make easy, you relax!

1065
01:20:21,962 --> 01:20:23,623
No talking.

1066
01:20:24,244 --> 01:20:25,815
When three.

1067
01:20:27,303 --> 01:20:28,768
One...

1068
01:20:29,729 --> 01:20:31,416
...Two...

1069
01:20:37,692 --> 01:20:39,204
...Three!

1070
01:21:34,185 --> 01:21:37,302
I made a mistake
Zinos. I am sorry.

1071
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:41,263
At least, I should call you, 
do you understand? But...

1072
01:21:42,588 --> 01:21:44,791
...I didn't have courage to tell you.

1073
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:47,580
When my grandma died...

1074
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,443
...I have been lockdown. I was in shock.

1075
01:21:49,563 --> 01:21:51,353
I didn't know what to do. 
Do you understand? 

1076
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,825
But, still I shouldn't 
behave you like that.

1077
01:21:54,945 --> 01:21:56,618
You don't deserve it.

1078
01:21:58,235 --> 01:22:00,461
Forgive me please.

1079
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:06,356
What now?

1080
01:22:07,446 --> 01:22:09,731
I need to take care of heritage. 

1081
01:22:10,317 --> 01:22:12,485
You became a rich woman, don't you? 

1082
01:22:18,206 --> 01:22:20,057
What about that man?

1083
01:22:22,225 --> 01:22:23,807
He returned there.

1084
01:22:25,096 --> 01:22:26,455
so, you?

1085
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:31,390
I will return, too. 

1086
01:22:37,472 --> 01:22:38,901
Here. Eat.

1087
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,390
Do you hear about Shayn?

1088
01:23:04,163 --> 01:23:06,472
He was talking about Honduras, wasn't he?

1089
01:23:08,557 --> 01:23:10,456
Is your salary good enough?

1090
01:23:10,678 --> 01:23:12,835
My children can sky for free, 
what do I need else?

1091
01:23:12,955 --> 01:23:13,842
It is all right.

1092
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:15,577
What about your band? 

1093
01:23:15,823 --> 01:23:17,757
We don't have place to practice. 

1094
01:23:18,108 --> 01:23:20,042
If I ever have a restaurant...

1095
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,327
...You can practice in it. 
- Okay!

1096
01:23:22,447 --> 01:23:24,178
- Okay?
- Okay!

1097
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:25,697
Thank you Chief.

1098
01:23:25,817 --> 01:23:26,641
Thank you.

1099
01:23:26,761 --> 01:23:27,757
Zinos.

1100
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:29,433
Do you hear about Shayn?

1101
01:23:29,553 --> 01:23:33,499
I heard that he is 
throwing knifes in a mobile circus. 

1102
01:23:33,619 --> 01:23:37,100
- He was a gypsy, right? 
- I guess so.

1103
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,244
What about Illias?

1104
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,775
You should visit him.

1105
01:23:42,526 --> 01:23:44,401
No need.

1106
01:23:44,521 --> 01:23:47,401
- Visit him..
- What for? It is nonsense.

1107
01:23:47,521 --> 01:23:50,451
- Lucia. You know...
- Yes, I know. "Visit him".
Go visit yourself. 

1108
01:23:50,571 --> 01:23:52,446
Two glass of champagne please.

1109
01:23:59,028 --> 01:24:01,079
Illias, want to play one hand? 

1110
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,674
I don't play anymore man.

1111
01:24:02,794 --> 01:24:04,432
- Fuck off.
- Fuck you.

1112
01:24:04,552 --> 01:24:07,775
- You still own me 35 bucks.
- You will get it, don't worry.

1113
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:11,091
Hey man. What about this dude?

1114
01:24:11,211 --> 01:24:14,536
He fucked revenue office, 
and revenue office fucked him now. 

1115
01:24:15,427 --> 01:24:17,068
Mr Neumann.
Walk forward please.

1116
01:24:17,188 --> 01:24:19,868
- Say hello to your brother. 
- I will.

1117
01:25:24,364 --> 01:25:27,997
"Voyager hasn't been reach his target. 
It is not over."

1118
01:25:30,153 --> 01:25:31,360
Shayn, Shayn, Shayn.

1119
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,270
Where are you bro?

1120
01:25:36,624 --> 01:25:38,865

01:25:59,626 --> 01:26:01,601
Maybe two hundred thousand Avro.

1127
01:26:02,439 --> 01:26:03,801
No.

1128
01:26:04,665 --> 01:26:07,199
