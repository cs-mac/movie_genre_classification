1
00:00:10,806 --> 00:00:12,057
<i>I am Ghost Agent K.</i>

2
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:15,245
<i>A shadow without a name or reputation.</i>

3
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,853
<i>Wasn't it your orders?</i>

4
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:19,105
<i>Fellow Ghost agent.</i>

5
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:20,941
<i>We must find the missing tapes.</i>

6
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:25,922
<i>Something the late Chairman Byung-do Mo
left only to Seung-jae Mo.</i>

7
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:27,656
<i>Everything, excluding myself,</i>

8
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,366
<i>The lonely hunter left behind</i>

9
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,785
<i>a riddle in his will.</i>

10
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:33,620
<i>I've solved it.</i>

11
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:35,747
<i>Byung-do Mo's dragon design.</i>

12
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:39,209
<i>Dong-hyun. Thank you for everything.</i>

13
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:22,919
<i>The picture Dong-hyun sent...</i>

14
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:25,145
The hunting rifle with a dragon on it...

15
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,763
The NIS director has the same one.
I have seen it.

16
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:35,848
Will and Testament.

17
00:01:43,398 --> 00:01:44,816
Why can't I reach Dong-hyun?

18
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,485
Where is he?

19
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,651
<i>I don't have any more assignments.</i>

20
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:34,449
In-soo Baek.

21
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,790
EPISODE 15

22
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,176
Why are you here?

23
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:59,141
What has this jerk been doing?

24
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,898
I said over and over, no hospitals or NIS.

25
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,691
How is Dong-hyun?

26
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,820
It's very bad.

27
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,535
We found the hit-and-run vehicle.

28
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:10,378
The hit-and-run driver drove
into a guardrail 10km away and died.

29
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:28,831
<i>He was drunk.
His blood alcohol level was 0.18.</i>

30
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:32,275
The police will likely write it off
as a simple drunk driving accident.

31
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:04,432
The tire marks go from dark to light
just before the site of impact.

32
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:09,479
Did he accelerate before the accident?

33
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,760
He accelerated on purpose
to hit Dong-hyun.

34
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,179
This wasn't an accident.

35
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,639
But then,

36
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,936
it's too clumsy for it
to have been the NIS director.

37
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:54,566
There must be someone else on the inside.

38
00:05:58,236 --> 00:05:59,362
It doesn't matter.

39
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,411
They are all going to die anyway.

40
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,153
<i>What are you doing?</i>

41
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:44,157
<i>Get over here and play a game with me.</i>

42
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:01,382
<i>Goodness.</i>

43
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,804
Why do you want to play
when you always lose?

44
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:07,554
Goodness.

45
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:11,017
I would win if you didn't play cheap.

46
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:13,245
Cheap? I'm just highly skilled.

47
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:16,064
I beat up plenty of kids in my hood
for playing like you.

48
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,920
- You can't fight.
- I have my face.

49
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:24,239
I looked older than most kids.
I hit them in the face.

50
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,598
- That's convincing.
- That's right.

51
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:30,996
- Block it. No.
- Yes.

52
00:07:32,414 --> 00:07:33,707
- Yes.
- Goodness.

53
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:35,267
Cheap move.

54
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,394
Damn it.

55
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:37,770
One more time.

56
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:39,921
I'm tired. Go home.

57
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,174
- Your wife is waiting.
- I'm working tonight.

58
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,903
I have to go on a stakeout later.

59
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:47,527
Why is a prosecutor going on a stakeout?

60
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:52,475
Is it that flasher?
Are you going to catch him?

61
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:57,731
I'm going to catch that punk soon.
I promise.

62
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,314
How?

63
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,901
Because I'm the prosecutor on the case.

64
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:05,697
What the hell?

65
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:06,864
Let's play.

66
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,160
Come on.

67
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:51,868
<i>Now we can get rid of
all the bad guys, right?</i>

68
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,204
It's all on the prosecutor.

69
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,500
By the law. By the rules.
I'll finish them all.

70
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,885
CONGRESSMAN IN-SOO BAEK

71
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:53,054
Why are you working with me?

72
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:58,143
I heard that unlike Chairman Mo,
who was a kingmaker,

73
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:02,313
you plan to enter into politics yourself.

74
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:05,441
You'll have to become the president.

75
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,613
You're not old enough
to run for president next year,

76
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,244
so you will need someone
to replace Congressman Baek.

77
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,249
You did this and fought Congressman Baek

78
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,377
out of your personal ambition?

79
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,631
I'll set the foundation for you.

80
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:33,052
You can take over afterward
and complete the reformation.

81
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:36,240
The first generation Ghost agents

82
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:39,559
want to maintain the relationship
with Songsan as well.

83
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,082
Your file is in there as well, right?

84
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,877
The records of illegal acts

85
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:09,797
you committed in your young,
Ghost agent days.

86
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,760
The past wrongdoings should be buried,

87
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:16,179
so that history can't remember.

88
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:21,684
What will you do about K?

89
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,815
Anyone who threatens national security

90
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,443
must be eliminated.

91
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:52,214
Search the place.

92
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:03,160
<i>It has been disclosed that the prosecutor,
Dong-hyun Lee, currently in a coma</i>

93
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:07,563
<i>after being hit in a hit-and-run accident,
was investigated by the NIS for espionage.</i>

94
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:11,776
<i>An NIS representative stated that Lee,
a former NIS agent, used his connections</i>

95
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:14,755
<i>to extract confidential information
and shared it.</i>

96
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,865
- What? What's going on?
<i>- With his spy ring.</i>

97
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:21,053
<i>Last night's accident
may not have been an accident,</i>

98
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,663
<i>and may have been an act by the spy ring.</i>

99
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:28,251
<i>If it is proved that he indeed is a spy,
it would have a massive effect.</i>

100
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,670
<i>Next, the weather forecast.</i>

101
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:34,507
That annoying old man.

102
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:37,552
He hid a safe behind his portrait.

103
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,511
He did?

104
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:43,474
Grandpa threw a sucker punch
at me from his grave,

105
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,935
so I have to return the favor.

106
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:50,148
I'll take my first step into politics,
which he was adamantly against,

107
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:51,649
in front of him.

108
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:53,985
At his memorial ceremony?

109
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:56,237
You have to go with me, so get ready.

110
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,196
I will.

111
00:12:58,823 --> 00:12:59,717
Right.

112
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:03,911
There will be a guest there today
that you'll be surprised to see.

113
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:06,247
Who?

114
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:27,327
<i>Why isn't Seol-woo answering his phone?</i>

115
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:28,352
<i>Where are you?</i>

116
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:30,437
I'm...

117
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:32,231
<i>at his studio.</i>

118
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:34,418
- Is he there?
<i>- No.</i>

119
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:39,614
Seol-woo isn't here, but it looks like
someone searched the place.

120
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,324
It's a mess.

121
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,743
Come to my house right now.

122
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,663
He left the third wood carving

123
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,666
and $5,000,000 here.

124
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:57,006
My goodness. Tae-ho!

125
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:59,026
What brings you here so early
in the morning?

126
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,426
I'll explain later.

127
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,638
It's urgent.
Can you get in touch with Mi-eun?

128
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,683
I haven't heard from K.

129
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:13,689
How is Dong-hyun doing?

130
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,818
He's still in surgery.
It doesn't look good.

131
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,156
The NIS director is working
with my husband now.

132
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,119
<i>I think they made
some sort of a deal last night.</i>

133
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:31,165
With both Robert Yoon's death
and Dong-hyun's accident,

134
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:33,268
if the NIS director is the traitor,

135
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,669
<i>it all falls into place.</i>

136
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,212
K knows already.

137
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:39,858
If K knows...

138
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:41,300
I don't know what he'll do.

139
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:42,885
We have to stop him.

140
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:46,805
Who are you?

141
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
We're with the NIS.

142
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Tae-ho.

143
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:53,330
We need to investigate something
regarding Dong-hyun Lee's espionage case.

144
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:54,354
Please come with us.

145
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:05,324
He got a call last night
and rushed off somewhere.

146
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:08,411
I think it was news about Mr. Lee.

147
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,498
What the hell is going on?

148
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,294
Something obviously went wrong.

149
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:18,296
I don't like it.

150
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:23,735
I've never seen that look in his eyes.

151
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,471
It was Dong-hyun, of all people,
who was attacked.

152
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,181
Hello?

153
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:30,724
This is Mi-eun Song.

154
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:39,859
BYUNG-DO MO

155
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,379
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

156
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:44,405
CHAIRMAN MO'S MEMORIAL CEREMONY

157
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,073
SONGSAN ELECTRONICS
SONGSAN PRODUCE

158
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,747
Everyone, bow.

159
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:00,838
Stand straight.

160
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:09,180
Please take your seats.

161
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,307
In order to clean out those involved
with the slush fund,

162
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:07,154
we worked with the NIS

163
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,700
and began
the "Make Songsan Upstanding" project.

164
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:13,012
Using that experience as a foundation,

165
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:16,247
<i>I plan to give my life</i>

166
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,252
<i>to begin a "Make Korea Upstanding" project
in using justice</i>

167
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:23,462
to create a powerful Korea.

168
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:27,717
I believe my grandfather,
the late Chairman Byung-do Mo,

169
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,679
<i>would support my decision today.</i>

170
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:36,642
<i>My companion and psychological mentor,</i>

171
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,230
<i>Mr. Suk-hoon Lim, the director of NIS,
will give his remarks.</i>

172
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:00,726
<i>First, I would like to thank you
for inviting me</i>

173
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,503
to the late Chairman Mo's
memorial ceremony.

174
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:09,759
<i>When I heard Mr. Seung-jae Mo,
the CEO of Songsan Group,</i>

175
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:14,489
<i>say he'll give his life to create
a just and upright Korea,</i>

176
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:16,033
<i>I was deeply...</i>

177
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:18,267
<i>What an incredible statement.</i>

178
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:21,437
<i>Look at this.
All the patriots are gathered here.</i>

179
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:48,463
Brother.

180
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:51,384
I know you're watching. Pick up.

181
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:57,473
Brother, let's talk.

182
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:26,544
Brother, pick up.

183
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,494
Step aside.

184
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:44,687
I want to kill

185
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:48,023
these dirty, conniving bastards
as much as you do.

186
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:51,819
But Dong-hyun is being investigated

187
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:54,947
for espionage.

188
00:19:58,659 --> 00:19:59,739
<i>If you finish it like this,</i>

189
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,912
what happens to Dong-hyun's honor?

190
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:11,129
<i>Seol-woo.</i>

191
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:15,885
You see me, don't you?

192
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,807
<i>You hear me, don't you?</i>

193
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:26,686
I...

194
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:30,357
trust you.

195
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:50,437
<i>I want to kill</i>

196
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:53,941
<i>these dirty, conniving bastards
as much as you do.</i>

197
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:58,279
If you finish it like this,
what happens to Dong-hyun's honor?

198
00:21:58,487 --> 00:21:59,655
I...

199
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:03,701
trust you.

200
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:17,941
What do you think about the NIS' claim
that he is a spy?

201
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:19,925
His fake ID was submitted as evidence.

202
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:21,692
Did you ever notice anything suspicious?

203
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:28,451
My husband is not a spy.

204
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:30,328
Then, do you deny the charges?

205
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:32,855
- Where did he say he was going last night?
- Those bastards.

206
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,190
What are they doing to the family?

207
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,650
Don't get worked up.

208
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:39,778
Excuse me.

209
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,576
You're apparently society journalists,

210
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:48,579
but you must know who I am.

211
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:52,559
Hollywood superstar, Dark Death.
I'm Un-gwang Yeo.

212
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,186
- Un-gwang Yeo?
- Why is Un-gwang Yeo here?

213
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,813
- Why is he here?
- What's his relationship?

214
00:22:56,837 --> 00:22:59,858
I would like to say something
about the prosecutor, Dong-hyun Lee.

215
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,762
- He wants to say something.
- What will he say?

216
00:23:05,638 --> 00:23:07,306
Dong-hyun Lee's charge of espionage

217
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:11,518
was completely fabricated and forged.
I'm sure of it.

218
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:13,937
What proof do you have?

219
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,649
You can tell after
being an actor for so long

220
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:21,153
whether someone's eyes are lying
or telling the truth.

221
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:26,659
The prosecutor Dong-hyun Lee that I know

222
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,161
is full of responsibility
and a sense of duty.

223
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:32,247
He's the most righteous prosecutor
in all of Korea.

224
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:54,412
Double the security.

225
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:57,648
Put the most experienced guards
on Jae-young.

226
00:23:57,981 --> 00:23:58,982
Yes, sir.

227
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:01,527
What's going on?

228
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:06,615
Un-gwang's bodyguard is
after the NIS director.

229
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:09,344
Is he? Why?

230
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:12,705
He's been charged with espionage
for working with foreign terrorists.

231
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,265
If you resigned,
you should just hike in the mountains.

232
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:33,141
Why did you come down?

233
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,812
Did you have to go that far
with Dong-hyun?

234
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:39,648
He's a suspect of espionage
who betrayed the country.

235
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:42,985
We're investigating
who caused the accident.

236
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,862
You're the traitor!

237
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:49,032
Have you been using us from the start?

238
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,246
The cameras are off,

239
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:56,498
so let's speak comfortably.

240
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:00,626
K.

241
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:03,088
Where is he?

242
00:25:04,298 --> 00:25:06,550
He won't get caught easily as I did.

243
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:07,967
Okay.

244
00:25:08,343 --> 00:25:09,343
Sure.

245
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:14,933
The person you're seeing right now...

246
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,686
Sharon Kim, right?

247
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:21,690
Well, it's late,
but if you plan to get married

248
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:24,067
and preserve your honor,

249
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:26,945
think very carefully.

250
00:25:27,863 --> 00:25:32,034
Whether your name will be included
among the ring of spies,

251
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:34,846
or whether you'll be on my side again.

252
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,330
Are you threatening me?

253
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:39,291
K is being openly searched for espionage.

254
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,085
Think carefully.

255
00:27:06,753 --> 00:27:08,422
You're not a doctor, are you?

256
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:19,308
My husband occasionally talked about

257
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:22,155
a junior agent who was a pain in the neck.

258
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,030
The doctors say...

259
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:37,326
he won't last three days.

260
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:40,203
But that's because they don't know him.

261
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,041
He will get up.

262
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:47,920
There are still too many bad people
that he needs to catch,

263
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:51,381
so he won't be able to leave like this.

264
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:58,138
Because he's an idiot who thinks
he has to catch every bad person himself.

265
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,645
By the law. By the rules.

266
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:07,438
He...

267
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:12,194
did what was right.

268
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:16,406
I left him alone
because he was doing what was right.

269
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:20,369
Had I known it was a losing battle,

270
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:25,123
I would have stopped him.

271
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:34,328
I should have tried to stop him.

272
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:43,934
It is not a losing battle.

273
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:54,194
I will take over from here.

274
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:57,738
By the law.

275
00:28:58,949 --> 00:28:59,949
By the rules.

276
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:26,643
Good work. Go home.

277
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:36,111
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's Dad.

278
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,839
Is it you, K?

279
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:07,893
You came in exactly
when I didn't expect you.

280
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:10,979
There's no way to stop you now.

281
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,359
However,

282
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:19,112
do not touch my family.

283
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:27,079
I will not kill you.

284
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:30,956
Instead,

285
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:35,587
I'll make your remaining days
a living hell.

286
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,761
I hope you live a long life.

287
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:08,870
This is the NIS director.

288
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:11,206
The spy Seol-woo Kim

289
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,708
must be shot on sight.

290
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:21,841
How could...

291
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:26,739
What is this espionage about?

292
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:30,892
The cops barged in this afternoon
and caused a huge scene.

293
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:33,854
Who the heck is this prosecutor,
Dong-hyun Lee?

294
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:37,816
Do you know you're number one trending
because of what you said in the hospital?

295
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,403
I didn't say anything wrong.

296
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:45,531
Un-gwang.

297
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:48,261
It's hard enough for me
to prevent scandals.

298
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:51,455
If you make the society page too,
when will we ever make our movie?

299
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:55,459
If that's the situation,
should I create a scandal?

300
00:31:56,418 --> 00:32:00,505
Something so big that it would
totally bury the espionage thing.

301
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:05,092
Un-gwang.

302
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,138
How can you make jokes right now?

303
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,016
Ms. Cha.

304
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:14,787
- Yes?
- Did you know Guard Kim was a spy?

305
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:16,491
You two were dating. You knew, didn't you?

306
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:19,917
Do you think Seol-woo is a spy?

307
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,318
Does what I think matter?

308
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:28,866
I don't think so.

309
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:31,703
He risked his life to save you.

310
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:36,625
He looks like someone who saves others,
not kills them.

311
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:43,297
So what?

312
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:45,091
Why does that matter right now?

313
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:48,738
See? I'm getting another call!
It's another reporter. Look!

314
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:51,806
Thank you so much!
I was about to call him myself!

315
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:55,185
Hello, Mr. Park. No. The thing is...

316
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:56,769
Anyway,

317
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,082
where do you think Seol-woo is?

318
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:03,485
Seeing how he left the third wood carving
and $5,000,000,

319
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,070
maybe he left.

320
00:33:06,488 --> 00:33:10,534
Is there really no way to contact him?

321
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:14,829
We don't know anyone other than Mr. Lee.

322
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:21,044
There is another person
connected to the NIS.

323
00:33:23,672 --> 00:33:26,800
- Who?
- The one who planted him as my bodyguard.

324
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:31,888
- Mi-eun?
- I need to confirm something anyway.

325
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,267
I have to see her.

326
00:33:45,944 --> 00:33:48,989
Mr. Jang is being investigated
by the NIS for espionage as well.

327
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,995
How is Dong-hyun doing?

328
00:33:58,415 --> 00:33:59,416
He's hanging in there.

329
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:06,339
Your husband is involved

330
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:08,466
with his accident.

331
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,513
The targets are the NIS director
and Seung-jae Mo.

332
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,351
Will you continue with the mission?

333
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,147
Yes.

334
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:24,982
Let's finish this.

335
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:27,986
No more sacrifices.

336
00:34:30,322 --> 00:34:32,442
We must find the missing material
on the NIS director.

337
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:36,387
He already destroyed them.

338
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,580
I'm sure your husband made a copy.

339
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,542
Look into it.

340
00:34:52,385 --> 00:34:54,846
You know things are crazy right now
because of the APB.

341
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:59,726
Did you see him?

342
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:04,230
I know these situations very well.

343
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:08,985
You need to listen carefully to me.

344
00:35:09,694 --> 00:35:11,488
Love doesn't feed you.

345
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,534
The more you're being chased unfairly,

346
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:18,745
the more you have to eat well.

347
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:22,749
If you see Seol-woo,

348
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,168
give him enough money...

349
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,714
to feed himself.

350
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:40,767
Those evil bastards.

351
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,561
Doing that to Mr. Lee...

352
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:46,439
They should all go to hell.

353
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,485
I'll look after Mr. Lee.

354
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:52,612
You look after Seol-woo.

355
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,490
Don't let people catch on.

356
00:35:58,785 --> 00:35:59,786
Dad.

357
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:03,872
Okay.

358
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,000
Be strong, my daughter.

359
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:10,672
Justice will surely prevail.

360
00:36:13,758 --> 00:36:14,758
Okay.

361
00:36:48,418 --> 00:36:52,797
Thank you for stopping this afternoon.

362
00:36:56,593 --> 00:36:59,095
You're alone again somewhere,

363
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:02,390
devising a tactic, aren't you?

364
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,563
But do you know something?

365
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:14,444
We still haven't ended our lovers tactic.

366
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:22,702
You said to hold onto it for one more day.

367
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:33,880
Please remember this one thing.

368
00:37:36,674 --> 00:37:38,885
You are not alone.

369
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,768
Thank you.

370
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,105
<i>VIP, it is time to wake up.</i>

371
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,358
Okay, Guard Kim.

372
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:21,696
I have to meet Mi-eun today and find you.

373
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:24,407
I have to get up...

374
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:28,035
Guard Kim?

375
00:39:32,665 --> 00:39:33,905
It's Jongro Coffee from Jongro.

376
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:38,981
How did you get in here?

377
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:41,090
The cops have been staking out.

378
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:43,676
I'm a very skilled agent.

379
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,057
It's good to see you safe.

380
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:54,145
Do-ha was very worried.
Did you contact her?

381
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:01,151
You did.

382
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:05,490
You contacted her before coming to me.

383
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,952
I was very worried too, you know.

384
00:40:11,204 --> 00:40:12,204
Hot.

385
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:22,756
I read the articles

386
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:24,949
about what you said about Dong-hyun

387
00:40:26,094 --> 00:40:27,094
at the hospital.

388
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:30,658
Are you okay?

389
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:33,059
Don't you worry.

390
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:36,270
Hollywood stars say what they need to.

391
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:39,607
Still, you cannot meet with Mi-eun.

392
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:43,611
If Seung-jae Mo finds out,
everyone will be in danger.

393
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:45,779
Sure.

394
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:47,573
That's true.

395
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,952
You're back, so it's okay.

396
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:55,373
Did you start a plan?

397
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:59,460
Let me know if you need anything.
We need to punish those bastards

398
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,460
who did that to Dong-hyun.

399
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:11,681
<i>You want the foundation?</i>

400
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,187
I don't like having old fogies interfere.

401
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:22,900
That money was theirs to begin with.

402
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,403
If you would appoint

403
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:29,407
a chairperson of their choice
as a formality,

404
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:34,245
you and I can run it in reality.

405
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,875
I'll give you half the seats on the board.

406
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:43,129
But my wife will continue on
as the chairperson.

407
00:41:44,297 --> 00:41:46,215
I guess you trust your wife a lot.

408
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:48,676
I trust her more than anyone.

409
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:51,804
You're more naive than you appear.

410
00:41:54,724 --> 00:41:58,019
You put your whole trust in the person
you should be most cautious of.

411
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:04,442
Did you know that your wife, Mi-eun Song,

412
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,907
was a secret agent
with the NIS in the past?

413
00:42:14,994 --> 00:42:16,287
I put her on you.

414
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:19,582
She was tasked to extract
information from you.

415
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:24,170
Think carefully.

416
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:30,736
Who do you think introduced K to Chewing

417
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,805
that he became Un-gwang Yeo's bodyguard?

418
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,607
If you don't believe me,
why don't you test her?

419
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:48,069
Based on what I know,

420
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:53,866
she seems to be helping K
with his mission.

421
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:42,999
What do you think of the NIS director?

422
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:47,545
He has an honest and upright image.

423
00:43:48,421 --> 00:43:52,133
He kicked out Congressman Baek's gang
and reformed the NIS,

424
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:54,343
so he seems to have skill and drive.

425
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:56,512
Then you think

426
00:43:57,722 --> 00:44:00,391
he's a good political companion.

427
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:03,768
I don't know.

428
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:07,231
I think you should be cautious with him.

429
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,919
Seeing how he joined you,
who was his enemy,

430
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,696
he'll betray you at any time
if it benefits him.

431
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:18,910
Don't worry too much.

432
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:24,165
I have a copy of the materials
which I could use against him.

433
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,501
It's in my safe.

434
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:30,004
Do you?

435
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:31,839
That's a relief.

436
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:44,560
I have a broadcast tomorrow,

437
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,480
so I can't have lunch with you.

438
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,481
It's a live broadcast,

439
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,609
so I can't change the time.

440
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,693
It's okay.

441
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:55,196
Good luck with the broadcast.

442
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,530
Thank you.

443
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,966
Are you doing okay?

444
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:17,885
You got rid of me

445
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:23,015
and became friends
with that kid Seung-jae.

446
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,019
All that rough talk tells me

447
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:29,814
you're adjusting well to prison life.

448
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,836
I found the tapes on you
and handed them over to the prosecutor.

449
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:38,364
A few more charges were tacked on,

450
00:45:39,115 --> 00:45:41,158
so you won't get out of here alive.

451
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,661
Be strong.

452
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:48,374
You think your file will never get out?

453
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:52,837
Don't you fret.

454
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:55,172
I destroyed them myself.

455
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,925
You don't think Seung-jae, that smart kid,

456
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:01,262
made a copy for himself?

457
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:18,571
Here is the copy.

458
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:37,673
I can get a copy of the documents
on the true identity of the foundation

459
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:39,045
formed from the slush fund.

460
00:46:40,426 --> 00:46:43,345
Also, a copy of the files
on the NIS director

461
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:46,807
is in my husband's safe.

462
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:52,021
Can you get it?

463
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:54,565
He has a live broadcast tomorrow.

464
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,526
That is the best time.

465
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:08,537
<i>Did you know that your wife, Mi-eun Song,</i>

466
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:13,334
<i>was a secret agent
with the NIS in the past?</i>

467
00:47:14,794 --> 00:47:16,170
If you don't believe me,

468
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,798
why don't you test her?

469
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,803
<i>She seems to be helping K
with his mission.</i>

470
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:32,394
<i>I have a copy of material
which I could use against him.</i>

471
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,270
<i>It's in my safe.</i>

472
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:36,732
That's a relief.

473
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:13,537
Is your investigation by the NIS over?

474
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:14,562
Not yet.

475
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,016
I'm being watched carefully.

476
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:21,944
I heard Dong-hyun still has a chance.

477
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:25,488
Yes.

478
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,576
If only I hadn't pulled
out of the mission,

479
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:32,246
it would have been me, not him.

480
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:35,229
As the one in charge of the mission,

481
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,585
it is all my fault

482
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,086
and my responsibility.

483
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:42,964
I'm sorry.

484
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:01,609
Of all the orders that I know,

485
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,653
saying "I'm sorry" is not one of them.

486
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:09,574
The mission

487
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:12,912
is not over yet.

488
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:44,025
Hello.

489
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:47,380
Hello. But who...

490
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:50,199
Well, to introduce myself,

491
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:53,869
I worked with Mr. Lee...

492
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:57,831
My goodness.

493
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,335
How did this happen...

494
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,380
Those bastards.

495
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,968
- Are you a fellow prosecutor?
- No.

496
00:50:09,802 --> 00:50:13,722
I was working with Mr. Lee,
whom I respect.

497
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:15,723
Well,

498
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:19,812
I was sort of a secret agent.

499
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:23,732
You must have gone through a lot.

500
00:50:24,566 --> 00:50:26,986
I know because I have a lot of experience.

501
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:31,949
But no matter how hard they hide it,
the truth always gets out.

502
00:50:33,534 --> 00:50:34,534
Okay.

503
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:36,245
Yes, well...

504
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:39,849
I'll take that.

505
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:42,102
- No, it's okay.
- No.

506
00:50:42,126 --> 00:50:44,044
You must be so upset.

507
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,297
You need to rest.

508
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,966
- But...
- Why don't you drink something?

509
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:50,175
Okay, then.

510
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:02,855
At least you aren't lonely.

511
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:13,699
Mi-eun is getting the documents
and handing them over to you.

512
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:19,163
With that, we can bury the NIS director
and Seung-jae, is that it?

513
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:24,251
But whom will you give those documents to?

514
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:30,132
True. Since Dong-hyun is the only one
we can trust, and he's unavailable.

515
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:35,179
Can't we post it online and distribute
them to all the media companies?

516
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:37,348
They do that often in the movies.

517
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:40,934
I don't like ending it that nicely.

518
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:46,774
Villains should be placed on a train
to hell and destroyed for good.

519
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:48,734
I have a plan.

520
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:55,031
Let's shoot a movie.

521
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:05,876
What happened?

522
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:07,211
Espionage?

523
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:11,340
I need your help.

524
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:16,970
A man being chased for espionage
is asking me for help.

525
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,057
That's a first.

526
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,143
Do you trust me?

527
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:27,564
If you are a spy,

528
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,172
something is wrong with the country.

529
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:33,404
If you say you aren't, I believe you.

530
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:39,910
What I'm about to tell you
is a matter of national security.

531
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,209
Hey.

532
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,607
What's this urgent matter?

533
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:55,426
I wanted to talk to you
about the next project.

534
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,009
Yes.

535
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:03,535
We didn't even finish the current movie.
Why do you want to discuss the next one?

536
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:04,726
Come on.

537
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,770
We can't lose out on this.

538
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:09,982
We read the scenario,
and it will be a blockbuster.

539
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:11,691
Look.

540
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:18,073
<i>HEARTS ON FIRE.</i>

541
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,010
SCREENPLAY AND PRODUCTION: DAE-SHIK MA

542
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:22,285
Director Ma?

543
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:27,177
Sure, it would be great
if we could get it.

544
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:31,378
But it's not like
he would even meet with me.

545
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:32,921
Come on.

546
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:34,381
Who am I?

547
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:36,967
I already found out where he'll be.

548
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:38,551
Today is our chance.

549
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:41,805
Go with Ms. Cha.

550
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,559
If Ms. Cha says we should do it,
we really should.

551
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:54,818
HIGH-QUALITY DRAMAS

552
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,490
Look.

553
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:01,950
Mr. Ji.

554
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:06,347
- Hello, Director Ma.
- Hi. How have you been?

555
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:08,475
- Good.
- Can we speak for a few minutes?

556
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:10,351
I have a broadcast to get to.

557
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:13,146
- It'll be a minute.
- Hello, Director Ma.

558
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,773
- Hi. How have you been?
- Hello.

559
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:18,550
Still, you have time for some coffee,
don't you?

560
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:21,529
Coffee? Shall we? Sure.

561
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:22,804
Let's go.

562
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:36,193
We're finishing it up now...

563
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:39,631
- I have your coffee.
- Thank you.

564
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:40,548
Here.

565
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:44,093
You like it sweet
with a lot of sugar, right?

566
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:47,037
How did you know I have diabetes?

567
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:48,789
Thanks.

568
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:57,047
It's not half bad. Thank you.

569
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:03,988
- Sir.
- Yes?

570
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,615
Where are you?

571
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:06,574
<i>Why aren't you here yet?</i>

572
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:09,268
My intestines feels like
they're drying up.

573
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:11,186
- I can't do it.
- Pardon?

574
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:12,205
<i>Hey.</i>

575
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:13,229
I need to go.

576
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:20,404
Why this old man...

577
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:23,991
How can he do this at a live broadcast?

578
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:26,909
Goodness.

579
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:28,035
Mr. Choi.

580
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:30,163
Did your guest flake on you?

581
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,208
That's terrible.

582
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:51,810
You're a wanted man.

583
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:54,228
Do you have it?

584
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:56,440
I do.

585
00:55:58,275 --> 00:55:59,635
But where do you plan to use this?

586
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:02,029
I need to blow them up.

587
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:23,175
I'll finish everything tonight.

588
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:43,862
So it was you.

589
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:47,199
You're the traitor
who got Robert Yoon killed.

590
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:52,204
You have to accept sacrifices
in running a country.

591
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:55,289
I'm sure.

592
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,212
I plan to leave.

593
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:02,089
Let's make a final deal.

594
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:05,342
Do you even have anything?

595
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:09,346
My husband has a copy of files on you.

596
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:13,475
I'll give it to you.

597
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:17,062
What do you want?

598
00:57:18,063 --> 00:57:21,858
A safe escape and new identities
for me and my child.

599
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,279
I guarantee it.

600
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,740
Don't think of doing anything to me

601
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:33,120
when I hand you the item as you did
to Robert and Dong-hyun.

602
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:37,040
I'll choose the time and place.

603
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,433
<i>PERSON TO PERSON.</i>

604
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,360
What are you doing?

605
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:10,824
I'm looking over
some foundation operation documents.

606
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:14,326
You are?

607
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:22,127
<i>Good luck with the broadcast.</i>

608
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:24,587
Okay.

609
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:26,339
See you later.

610
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,150
What is it?

611
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,195
We need to check your bag.

612
00:58:49,237 --> 00:58:50,237
My bag?

613
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:58,705
- Did you find it?
<i>- She didn't have anything on her.</i>

614
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:00,498
What?

615
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:02,959
That can't be.

616
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:07,196
It's ten minutes before we go live.

617
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:08,872
Please stand by in the studio.

618
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:15,387
Okay.

619
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:30,570
<i>Can you get it?</i>

620
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:35,283
He has a live broadcast tomorrow.

621
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:37,953
That is the best time.

622
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:44,042
But my husband is lying to me.

623
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,297
I saw suspicion in his eyes.

624
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:53,260
I'm sure there's a trap.

625
01:00:05,313 --> 01:00:06,313
Let's begin our deal.

626
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:10,026
<i>My husband is in the studio
filming a live broadcast.</i>

627
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:24,290
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

628
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:25,792
- He's here.
- Okay.

629
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:27,793
Mr. Mo.

630
01:00:27,919 --> 01:00:29,639
Thank you very much
for agreeing to do this.

631
01:00:30,046 --> 01:00:31,107
My pleasure.

632
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:34,217
But there was a problem
with the other guest,

633
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:35,969
so we had to get someone else.

634
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:38,263
I heard you know each other well.

635
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:41,182
There he is.

636
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:50,525
Hello, Mr. Mo.

637
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:54,779
It's been a while.

638
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:01,036
I have a feeling today's show
will be very interesting.

639
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:10,771
<i>PERSON TO PERSON.</i>

640
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:12,315
You totally saved me.

641
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:13,339
Come on.

642
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:16,317
We're in the same industry,
so we should have each other's backs.

643
01:01:18,386 --> 01:01:19,386
Have some.

644
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,642
We're in the same industry,
so I will buy dinner sometime.

645
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:26,871
Okay, let's test the cameras. Stand by.

646
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,606
<i>PERSON TO PERSON.</i>

647
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:33,777
<i>PERSON TO PERSON.</i>

648
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:36,964
What are you trying to do?

649
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:39,282
It's a talk show, so we talk, obviously.

650
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:42,744
Ask and answer.

651
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:58,677
Answer truthfully to the questions asked.

652
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:15,558
It's an assassination-use explosive
developed in Mossad.

653
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:25,447
With a press of this button,

654
01:02:26,037 --> 01:02:27,080
only your heart will go...

655
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:29,164
boom.

656
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,762
Don't try to run or do anything stupid.

657
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,557
Just answer truthfully.

658
01:02:57,235 --> 01:02:59,529
<i>PERSON TO PERSON.</i>

659
01:03:02,782 --> 01:03:06,244
Only the truth can save you.

660
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,240
<i>The final mission.</i>

661
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,888
<i>Why did you try to kill me twice?</i>

662
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:50,747
<i>All the truth will be revealed.</i>

663
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:53,184
<i>The world cannot take your side.</i>

664
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:56,169
<i>Once in a while,
the world flips upside down.</i>

665
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:58,272
<i>Today is that day.</i>

666
01:03:58,296 --> 01:03:59,899
<i>Blow it up now.</i>

667
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,925
My dear citizens, you must know the truth.

668
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,094
The person behind all of this...

669
01:04:04,677 --> 01:04:06,346
It's time for revenge.

670
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:09,825
<i>He left.</i>

671
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,577
<i>Guard Kim may have disappeared,</i>

672
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:14,145
<i>but Brother will be back.</i>
