(Episode 15)

2
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:35,617
Professor, I heard you
were going on a vacation.

3
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,317
It was a sudden change of mind.

4
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:41,947
I'm sorry for what happened.
You really need to get a rest.

5
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:43,917
By the way, where are you going?

6
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:45,917
I don't know yet.

7
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:23,077
That makes me...

8
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:26,047
a serial killer.

9
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:30,247
I visited the tunnel...

10
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:32,617
after a long time.

11
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:35,847
I found peace after 30 long years.

12
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:40,247
I thought no one knew who I was.

13
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,377
Keeping a secret...

14
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:49,047
was so exciting that it made me laugh.

15
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,847
I never thought he would
follow me all the way there.

16
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:05,747
- Thank you.
- Bye, Corporal Park.

17
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,247
Ma'am.

18
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:13,017
What is it?

19
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:16,917
Did you know that there was a
tunnel in this neighborhood?

20
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:18,617
- A tunnel?
- Yes.

21
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,377
I've been working here for three
years and yet I didn't know.

22
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:23,853
It looks really old.

23
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,217
I know that tunnel. It is old.

24
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:30,317
A woman was murdered there.

25
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,317
- What?
- It's been over 30 years.

26
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,977
I went to school with her.

27
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:39,247
I feel so sorry for her.

28
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:42,947
Why do you ask?

29
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,877
It's always people talking
about and remembering...

30
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:49,847
others' deaths that cause problems for me.

31
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,147
This is why...

32
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:12,077
I told you to leave me be.

33
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:14,647
Until then,

34
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:18,117
I just thought my peace was broken.

35
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:23,217
However, I realized today...

36
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:26,417
that everything that happened...

37
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:30,317
was destined for me.

38
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:33,177
I see a new face. Why don't we
at least exchange greetings?

39
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,317
I'm Detective Park Kwang... No.

40
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,277
- I'm Corporal Park Kwang Ho.
- I'm Mok Jin Woo.

41
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:42,417
My mother is also a victim of the
serial killing of 30 years ago.

42
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,917
How can that be?

43
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,377
I thought it was a relief
that I came to know...

44
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:51,417
Corporal Park is my father even
though it's a little late.

45
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:56,447
Destiny brought the three of them to me.

46
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:12,547
Yeon Ho, Yeon Ho?

47
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:14,947
Yeon Ho, Yeon Ho!

48
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:18,777
Yeon Ho!

49
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:36,947
What do you mean by that?

50
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,017
Professor Shin has gone missing?

51
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,877
She told me she'd come
to the police station.

52
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:43,917
She...

53
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:46,447
She told me...

54
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:50,417
Her cellphone was on the floor.

55
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,446
We don't really know what happened.

56
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:00,677
She said she'd arrive soon.

57
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:03,047
Sun Jae,

58
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:06,187
she'd never drop and leave
her things on the floor.

59
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:10,917
All right, I get what you are saying.

60
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:13,717
Let's check the CCTV first.

61
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:31,547
Wait. Go back to this part.

62
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:39,817
That scum.

63
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,477
I'll kill him.

64
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:50,347
What about the other CCTV? Can't
we check where his car went?

65
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,547
Wait a moment.

66
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:57,047
Let's go.

67
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:58,517
But Kwang Ho,

68
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,947
Professor Shin isn't there.

69
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,647
- No way.
- It can't be.

70
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,447
That scum.

71
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,317
She hasn't gone missing.
She has been kidnapped.

72
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:48,747
Put out an all-points
bulletin for the car...

73
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:50,917
and trace his phone's location.

74
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:53,677
What happened to the search warrant?

75
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,647
What? You need to get it no matter what!

76
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:58,547
Goodness.

77
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,717
- Did you get anything?
- He must have drugged her.

78
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,817
What is going on?

79
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:10,617
What would happen to Kwang Ho if
something has happened to her?

80
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:12,447
- Chief.
- Yes?

81
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:17,493
According to the assistant, she
left the office at 7:27pm.

82
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:20,416
The last phone call she made
to Kwang Ho was at 7:35pm.

83
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:24,193
The CCTV recording of his car
at the main gate was at 7:42pm.

84
00:07:24,217 --> 00:07:25,217
That scum.

85
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,677
It's been over an hour.

86
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:31,677
- Any witnesses?
- None. And that's the only CCTV.

87
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,176
What about Kwang Ho and Sun Jae?

88
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:37,477
They went to the control center to
track the movements of his car.

89
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,946
It's a race against time. We need to hurry.

90
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:42,947
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:50,647
Next.

92
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:55,117
No, the next one.

93
00:07:58,547 --> 00:07:59,647
Next.

94
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:02,777
Stop there.

95
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,877
(8:40pm)

96
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:13,647
He left through the Hwayang
Tollgate 40 minutes ago.

97
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,817
The car stopped here.

98
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:08,717
- The car stopped?
- Yes.

99
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,217
But after kidnapping her,

100
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,777
he went straight to the Hwayang
Tollgate from the parking lot.

101
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,577
According to the recorded time,

102
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:21,117
it took 20 minutes, meaning he didn't stop.

103
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,057
That means he has a destination.

104
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:27,717
He's right. He won't be carrying
her in his car everywhere.

105
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:29,747
He'd be exposed easily.

106
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:32,347
The fact that the tracks
stopped at the tollgate...

107
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:36,417
He might have used a national
highway to hide his destination.

108
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,553
Then our first priority is to
figure out his destination.

109
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,623
We should watch all the CCTVs of
every national highway as well.

110
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,453
We also need to step up the inspection.

111
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:44,517
All right.

112
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,253
(Hwayang University parking lot,
Hwayang University main gate)

113
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:52,576
Chief, why don't we start
an open investigation?

114
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:56,147
No. If it's exposed in the media,
everything we do will be exposed.

115
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:58,717
Nobody knows what he will
do to Professor Shin.

116
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:08,877
Where on earth is the fountain pen?

117
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,237
It's only Professor Shin who knows it.

118
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,447
We should find her first.

119
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,577
Mok Jin Woo was born in Seoul.

120
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:23,953
It's been long since his
grandmother's house was gone.

121
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,723
Is there any real estate under his name?

122
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:27,717
There is one he's living in.

123
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,687
I couldn't find any clue there.

124
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:31,877
Let's go to his previous houses.

125
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:34,197
He must have gone to a
place he's familiar with.

126
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,527
We should investigate areas he
provided volunteer medical services.

127
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:39,047
Most of them are islands,

128
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:41,887
and there are many empty houses,
which are good to hide.

129
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:46,247
Chief, Kwang Ho and I are going
to find his destination first.

130
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:47,917
Okay. Go ahead.

131
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,453
Tae Hee and Min Ha,
investigate his call history,

132
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:52,917
bank statement, credit card details,

133
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:55,817
and the internet search history.

134
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:59,717
I'll check the CCTVs of the national roads.

135
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,457
The top priority is to catch up with him.

136
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:04,947
Come on. Let's go.

137
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:23,777
It's done.

138
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:25,076
Thank you.

139
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:26,117
Okay.

140
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:53,217
Sir, is there any other
problem in the trunk?

141
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,147
No, What's wrong?

142
00:11:58,277 --> 00:12:01,077
I heard some sound from it.

143
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:32,777
Hello.

144
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:34,617
Yes, sir.

145
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:36,617
I'll be there shortly, sir.

146
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,646
Could you tell me again
where you are exactly?

147
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:40,847
Okay, I see.

148
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:44,747
I'm sorry. Drive safely, sir.

149
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:46,147
Thank you.

His call history of a month shows...

159
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:25,377
that he called only his
family and his office.

160

There's not a single unusual record.

161
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:30,517
He hardly used his credit cards.

162

He's beyond Jung Ho Young.

00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:42,717
You mean that customer?

166
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:45,217
There was a nail stuck in the wheel.
I patched it up.

167
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:46,977
Where was it?

168
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:49,747
It was 43 national highway in Yeonkyung.

169
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,007
Is it 43 national highway in Yeonkyung?

170
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,317
He's never lived in Yeonkyung.

171
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:55,947
Here it is.

172
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:59,347
He provided volunteer medical
service in Yeonkyung.

173
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:00,577
What?

174
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,997
Is there any other things to say about him?

175
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:05,547
Didn't you see a woman?

176
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:08,417
No, there wasn't a woman. He was alone.

177
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:14,077
Oh, right. There was some sound
coming out of the trunk.

178
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:16,517
What?

179
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,047
What is this? Gosh.

180
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:43,247
- Is this it?
- There doesn't seem to be a CCTV.

181
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:49,377
Come here.

182
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,947
It can't be a place we can easily find.

183
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,617
Mok Jin Woo took her to
a place only he knows.

184
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,047
Where on earth is that?

185
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,847
I'll ask where the fountain pen is...

186
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:09,617
three times only.

187
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:13,047
If you don't answer the question,

188
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:16,277
you will be dead.

189
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,597
You'll be given only three
chances to answer it.

190
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:23,417
Remember that.

191
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:29,577
Here goes the first one.

192
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,517
Where is the fountain pen?

193
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:47,077
You still have two chances left.

194
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,407
I'll ask the same question
for the second time...

195
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,017
and third time.

196
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:04,617
Where is the fountain pen?

197
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:17,777
Where on earth is it?

198
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:29,117
Are you going to answer it?

199
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:46,477
England.

200
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,647
It's in England.

201
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:51,717
What?

202
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:54,747
Do you expect me to believe that?

203
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,617
You know I was adopted.

204
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:04,717
Everything from my childhood is in England.

205
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,077
I just need to call.

206
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,387
You will have to pay for it...

207
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,177
if you're trying to fool me.

208
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:24,347
Answer me carefully.

209
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:27,887
Is it really in England?

210
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,317
(International call)

211
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:01,887
Hello?

212
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:07,047
It's me.

213
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:10,277
You mind checking the time
difference before calling?

214
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:14,947
Listen. I need you to do me a favor.

215
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:18,747
Remember the fountain pen I've always kept?

216
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:21,447
Do you think you can send it over here?

217
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,423
A fountain pen?

218
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:28,717
Yes, it should be in the bible
inside the third drawer of my desk.

219
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:31,747
The address is...

220
00:21:32,217 --> 00:21:34,047
Send it to the university.

221
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,747
You can send it to my
office at the university.

222
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:41,347
And please hurry.

223
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,017
How long will it take?

224
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:50,417
It could arrive within...

225
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:53,847
as early as three days.

226
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:57,977
Three days.

227
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:04,517
What should we do in the meantime?

228
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:17,177
What is it?

229
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,647
Did something happen to Professor Shin?

230
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:23,577
How did you know that?

231
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:24,846
Did something really happen?

232
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:27,877
She called her friend in England.

233
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,477
What?

234
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:31,593
She made a call?

235
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,047
What is this about?

236
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:36,376
Her friend called me saying
something was wrong...

237
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:37,777
and that her phone was turned off.

238
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,017
She wanted her to send a fountain pen.

239
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,517
A fountain pen?

240
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,777
What?

241
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:31,451
I thought something was weird.

242
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:34,821
The desk that Jae Yi used
doesn't have any drawers.

243
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,521
And none of her things are here either.

244
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:40,351
You don't think something
bad happened to her?

245
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,481
Don't worry. I'll make sure
that nothing ever goes wrong.

246
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:48,881
First, I need you to put any
of your pen inside the bible.

247
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:52,051
And send it over as soon as possible.

248
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,680
All right. I'll do that.

249
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,781
It'll probably arrive in three days.

250
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:00,951
Please contact me once again
when you're done sending.

251
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,481
- All right.
- Thank you. Bye.

252
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:07,121
- What did she say?
- It'll arrive in three days.

253
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:10,321
I think Professor Shin was
trying to buy time for us.

254
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,297
She must have thought that if she
called her friend in England,

255
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,451
I would be able to hear about it.

256
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:18,921
We should hide in Hwayang
University and catch Mok Jin Woo.

257
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:23,280
What if he finds out about her lying?

258
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:25,081
We need to get him before that.

259
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:29,181
She lied while risking her life.

260
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,051
She knows better than anyone...

261
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:33,281
that it's the only evidence.

262
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:38,881
Don't worry. We'll get him this time.

263
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,621
He won't do anything before
he checks the pen...

264
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:44,581
with his own eyes. As
Professor Shin told us,

265
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:47,441
it's the one thing Mok Jin Woo
wants to retrieve the most.

266
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,781
We need to prepare for stakeout
during these three days.

267
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:55,921
That's right, kiddo. It'll
all be over in three days.

268
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,321
These three days...

269
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,321
seem like 30 years to me.

270
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:31,581
I have a question.

271
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:38,051
That picture...

272
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:42,081
was drawn by you, right?

273
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:48,081
You lived here with your mother.

274
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:53,841
Do you want an interview or something?

275
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,421
Or is this profiling?

276
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:03,251
We have three days until the pen arrives.

277
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,551
It doesn't seem like a bad idea...

278
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,451
to chat in the meantime.

279
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:18,221
I asked Jung Ho Young once...

280
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,621
why he was obsessed with skirts...

281
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,881
and if his mother liked to wear them.

282
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:26,821
But that...

283
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:30,751
was your obsession.

284
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:35,321
It was not his mom, but yours.

285
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,081
Actually,

286
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:47,521
Jung Ho Young didn't have a type.

287
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:49,181
But...

288
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:51,621
you did...

289
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,351
because you saw your mother in them.

290
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:00,281
What was your mother like?

291
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:18,981
Don't lie! You didn't catch
the man behind the mask!

292
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,881
(Bridal Mask)

293
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:37,121
You are invaders! You are
bullies who tried to fight me.

294
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:38,381
Take that!

295
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:52,051
Mom, I finished reading the comic book.

296
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:54,720
- Right. I swear if you don't...
- Come back. Come inside.

297
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:57,551
- Mom, Mom!
- Please, wait!

298
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:10,051
What? What is wrong with you?

299
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:13,521
I just...

300
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:17,281
You told me to call you when
I finish the comic book.

301
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,851
I'm sorry, Mom.

302
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:31,121
Come down. Let's eat.

303
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:33,381
Okay.

304
00:28:33,382 --> 00:28:36,781
(Bridal Mask)

305
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:43,351
Did she wear a skirt and stockings...

306
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:45,951
and go out to see a man?

307
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:48,621
What?

308
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,450
You must've seen it every day until...

309
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:53,621
you were sent to your grandmother's.

310
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:56,921
You must've known that if your
mother wears a skirt and stockings,

311
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:59,081
it means she's going to work.

312
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:04,321
You probably waited alone in
this house until she came home.

313
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:07,921
There must have been many days
you fell asleep while waiting.

314
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,981
Then you suddenly...

315
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:13,781
started to resent your mother
for leaving you alone.

316
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,081
Hatred for someone deepens
as much as you love them.

317
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:21,451
You must've hated to see your mom go out.

318
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:23,121
Am I wrong?

319
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:44,151
Mom. Look at this.

320
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,781
Read the comic books and play alone, okay?

321
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:07,521
Gosh, darling.

322
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:12,021
Darling. Gosh, stop it.

323
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,521
What on earth is this?

324
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:25,681
This is the dress I got you yesterday.
Did you do this, Tiffany?

325
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,421
What on earth?

326
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,851
That's why you killed women
in stockings, right?

327
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:45,451
They reminded you of your mom.

328
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:49,321
It was you who was repeatedly
killing your mother,

329
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,781
not Jung Ho Young. It was you.

330
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,151
You don't know anything.

331
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:59,320
Those women had to die for a reason.

332
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:01,281
You killed them for a reason?

333
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:04,281
Don't be absurd.

334
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:07,821
You think you're different from Jung
Ho Young who killed women for sport.

335
00:31:08,851 --> 00:31:09,981
You're wrong.

336
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:13,020
You're just like him.

337
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:14,081
I'm different!

338
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:16,321
I'm different.

339
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:19,520
All of those women were guilty.

340
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:21,581
What was Yoon Da Young guilty of?

341
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:23,150
What about Nam Ju Hee?

342
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:25,151
They shouldn't have
wandered around at night.

343
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:27,551
They shouldn't have done that.

344
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,451
What about Lieutenant Kim's mother...

345
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:33,551
who went out to buy her husband's tie?

346
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,351
I saw her on the bus.

347
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:39,421
She smiled at another man.

348
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:42,021
How can a mother like that
raise a child properly?

349
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,651
He's better off without a mother like that.

350
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:48,951
You're wrong.

351
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:53,221
You killed those women just
because you wanted to.

352
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,651
You killed them instead of your mom...

353
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,821
whether they're ordinary or not.

354
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,451
I don't even know how you can tell
if a person is ordinary or not.

355
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:04,821
You just...

356
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:07,221
enjoyed murdering them.

357
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:10,421
Just like Jung Ho Young.

358
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:13,881
What?

359
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:16,051
Are you going to strangle me again?

360
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:20,781
See? You just want to kill someone.

361
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:23,421
Strangle me.

362
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:25,321
Kill me.

363
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:31,151
Kill me, you murderer!

364
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:07,380
- It will only take a second.
- Gosh.

365
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:08,750
Can I take you tonight?

366
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,980
- All right. Let's go somewhere.
- Do you want to have some fun?

367
00:33:10,981 --> 00:33:12,751
- You're so sexy.
- Honey.

368
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:14,050
- Come on.
- I'd love that.

369
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:15,080
Can you handle three guys?

370
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:17,080
- Baby, that's right.
- I won't charge you much.

371
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:18,850
- You can get the prettiest one.
- Me too.

372
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:20,681
- Don't worry about it.
- I got plenty.

373
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:23,121
It's a gift for entering middle school.

374
00:33:31,981 --> 00:33:33,220
- How are you doing?
- Come here.

375
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,250
You're looking good tonight.

376
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:35,451
It's my baptismal name.

377
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:39,850
I'd love that.

378
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,251
Can you handle three guys?

379
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:44,751
Be good to your grandmother.

380
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:46,481
I got plenty.

381
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,391
- Do this thing.
- Look at these ladies.

382
00:33:55,151 --> 00:33:56,181
Taxi.

383
00:33:58,321 --> 00:33:59,321
Let's go.

384
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:11,221
Kid. You shouldn't come
to a place like this.

385
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:22,891
Hello.

386
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:25,781
- Hello, honey.
- Hi.

387
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:28,951
Those filthy women.

388
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:39,151
Hey!

389
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:44,781
Hey!

390
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:53,721
My mom isn't that kind of a person.
She's not that kind of a person!

391
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:57,761
- She's not that kind of a person!
- Hey!

392
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:01,321
My mom...

393
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,421
isn't that kind of a person.

394
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:08,921
She's not that kind of a woman.

395
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,391
(Satellite map of Hwayang University)

396
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,251
Yes, this is Kim Sun Jae.

397
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:20,851
Hey, it's Kate.

398
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,920
I'm calling because I think the package...

399
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,891
will arrive some time tomorrow morning.

400
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:28,651
Professor Shin's office is here.

401
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:31,081
These two are the only
entrances to the building.

402
00:35:32,021 --> 00:35:34,351
Unit Two will stake out
near these entrances.

403
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:35,621
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

404
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:37,411
Where is the front gate of the school?

405
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:39,151
These are the front and back gates.

406
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:41,721
Her laboratory is nearer to the front gate.

407
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:44,921
Mok Jin Woo will probably use the
front gate to shorten the distance.

408
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:48,021
Tae Hee and Min Ha, you will wait
for him at the gate with me.

409
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,121
We have to catch him inside the building.

410
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:51,680
Otherwise, we might lose him.

411
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:54,481
You and I will wait for him near
Professor Shin's office and attack.

412
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:57,781
Do you think he will show up by himself?

413
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:59,351
I think he will.

414
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:03,391
It's too risky for him to take
Professor Shin here as the hostage.

415
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,321
Let's catch him first.

416
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:10,081
Sun Jae. When will the package arrive?

417
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:13,121
It'll arrive some time
between 10am and 11am.

418
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:16,621
Let's move now.

419
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:33,750
Be at the entrances of the
building where her office is.

420
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:34,781
Yes, sir.

421
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,681
Let's go.

422
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,841
(Hwayang Police Station promises our
citizens safety and happiness.)

423
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:16,851
Be on standby at your positions for now,

424
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:18,451
and we'll take our places at dawn.

425
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,021
Stay quiet.

426
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:01,921
Stay alert.

427
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:08,951
An express delivery truck just went in.

428
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:19,621
It just went in.

429
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:56,980
(Operating Systems Laboratory)

430
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:57,981
Who's that?

431
00:38:58,621 --> 00:38:59,651
What?

432
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:07,281
Excuse me. One moment.

433
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:13,557
By any chance, was there a package
delivered to Ms. Shin Jae Yi?

434
00:39:13,581 --> 00:39:14,821
Ms. Shin Jae Yi?

435
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:20,181
That's right. I remember. Someone
else received it for her.

436
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:22,521
What?

437
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:26,781
Thank you.

438
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:42,681
Chief. Mok Jin Woo's not here.

439
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:56,521
These are the front and back gates.

440
00:39:56,751 --> 00:39:58,890
Her laboratory is nearer to the front gate.

441
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:02,221
Mok Jin Woo will probably use the
front gate to shorten the distance.

442
00:40:02,391 --> 00:40:04,181
We have to catch him inside the building.

443
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:07,151
You and I will wait for him near
Professor Shin's office and attack.

444
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:29,081
This is driving me crazy.

445
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,050
He must've sensed something.

446
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:34,151
We were hiding out since last night.
There's no way he could've known.

447
00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:36,051
How could he have found out?

448
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:40,021
Also, how could he have known
Yeon Ho had the fountain pen?

449
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:42,651
That conversation was just
between Sun Jae and I.

450
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:53,221
Wait a minute.

451
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:59,151
Even if you've made a stupid move,

452
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:00,751
you shouldn't give up.

453
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:18,551
Why? What is it?

454
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,951
What is that? It can't be.

455
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:56,221
Gosh. Darn it.

456
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:00,451
That scumbag.

457
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,521
He was listening to everything.

458
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:08,251
If he dares to lay a finger on Yeon Ho,

459
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:10,281
I'll kill him.

460
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:18,021
Kwang Ho. Kwang Ho.

461
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:28,781
Did you fool me?

462
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:39,321
Why?

463
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:42,721
Did you think you'd be
able to earn some time?

464
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:54,221
It's not in England, is it?

465
00:42:58,351 --> 00:42:59,421
Where is it?

466
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:01,151
Where's the fountain pen?

467
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:06,081
Tell me where it is!

468
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,510
Yeon Sook.

469
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,950
Forgive me.

470
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,110
I promise I'll...

471
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,110
I'll...

472
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,610
protect our daughter.

473
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,050
No matter what it takes,

474
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,280
I'll make sure to save her.

475
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,249
Then I'll look into Mok Jin Woo.

476
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,879
I'll try to see where the
mode of operation leads to...

477
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,180
and whether there are any clues.

478
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,949
The daughter left Jin
Woo with her mother...

479
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:45,180
when he was around 11 or 12 years old...

480
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,610
saying she was going to go earn money.

481
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,050
Whenever she visited, she showed
up with a handful of gifts.

482
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,280
From time to time, I received
a pair of stockings myself.

483
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:00,050
Back then, stockings were
considered as luxury goods.

484
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,380
- Stockings?
- That's right.

485
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,110
She worked at a place
called "Town" or somewhere.

486
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,880
Then how did his mother pass away?

487
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,380
She died in a hospital. Apparently,
she suffered from alcoholism.

488
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,350
It could be somewhere
connected to his mother.

489
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,880
You're looking for Kim
Ji Hye from 1985, right?

490
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,010
It says here she died of alcoholism.

491
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,549
What is it you'd like to know?

492
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,950
Her address. Do you have the
address of her house at the time?

493
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,650
I'm not sure if this place still exists.

494
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,450
House number 58 of "New
York Town" in Mijucheon.

495

The old lady in Yeon Ho's tape
recording also mentioned "Town".

00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,250
Thank you for your help.

497
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,450
Chief. We found out where
Mok Jin Woo's hiding out.

498
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,350
I see. You're refusing
to answer, aren't you?

499
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,430
Does that mean it's my turn then?

500
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,180
The person you've been looking for...

501
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,110
is Park Kwang Ho, isn't it?

502
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:47,680
How does it feel to meet your
father who's younger than you?

503
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,780
Since you've revealed a secret that
I've had for the past 30 years,

504
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,610
it's only fair that I get
something from this, isn't it?

505
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,350
He killed the real Park Kwang Ho...

506
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,650
and he's using his identity
and acting as a policeman.

507
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,480
Who should I share this with?

508
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,110
The chief of the crime department?

509
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,580
The chief of police?

510
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,210
Or the press?

511
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,410
Please don't.

512
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,080
Tell me.

513
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,310
Where's the fountain pen?

514
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,910

515
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,050
Shall we hide it here?

516
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:40,450
Okay.

517
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:49,280

518

519

Really?

520
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,050
Of course.

521
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,210
You should never tell
anyone until he returns...

522
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,280
because this is a treasure hunt.

523
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,510
Okay.

Did you lose him?

I have the evidence. We just
have to find him again.

But...

556
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:40,880
why do you think Mok Jin Woo was so
obsessed with this fountain pen?

557
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:45,050
And why do you think he
didn't kill me right away?

no one would've ever found this pen.

meant something special to him?

It's been too long.

You know we can't charge
him with anything...

in the Hwayang District)

Mok Jin Woo mentioned this
during the Jung Ho Young Case.

597

You should focus on what happened
before rather than afterwards.

Focus on his identity.

599

Then I'm sure it'll lead you
to where the suspects headed.

If he meant what he said,

601

Mok Jin Woo is sure to
go after females again.

602
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,180
He won't stop committing murders.

603
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:58,210
The reason he killed elders while
volunteering medical service...

604
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,180
was a passive way to reduce
any potential risk factors.

605
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,210
Hold on. Then do you mean to
say he'll commit more murders?

When he was released from
the station last time,

607

he was bold enough to kill
another female right after.

608
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,826
According to Yeon Ho, Mok Jin Woo...

609
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,710
is bound to go after a female
that reminds him of his mother.

610
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,826
Like he did in the past,
he'll move by foot.

611

Only this time, the location will
be somewhere easier to find.

The victims that Mok Jin
Woo normally goes after...

are usually found in the downtown area.

614
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:26,049
Then is it possible he could commit
a murder in a different town?

615
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,010
No. He'll still be in Hwayang.

616
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,250
It's hard to break a habit.

617

Just like how he returned
to the crime scene,

618

he won't be able to leave this town
where he committed the crimes.

619

He has to be somewhere near by.

We need to know where his
next destination will be.

The place where he first met them?

629

In the past, he killed his victims
at the same place he abducted them.

630

But he couldn't have done that in Hwayang.

It's more developed and
there are more CCTVs.

Mok Jin Woo was so persistent
in finding that fountain pen?

didn't kill me right away?

(Tunnel)

655
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:32,909
Yeon Ho. Where are you? Are you all right?

656
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:36,380
There are still so many that
must be punished in this world.

657
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,509
It's all because you
went after Mok Jin Woo.

658
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,510
Thanks to you, we were
able to catch the culprit.

659
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:43,050
Thank you and forgive me.

660
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,650
You deserve to die, you scum!

661
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,650
We would like to express
our sincere apologies.

662
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,026
You're going back?

663
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,780
I think I've done my job here.

664
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,750
I'm really going this time.
