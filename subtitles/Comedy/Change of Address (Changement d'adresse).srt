1
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,858
What's the matter? You're quiet.

2
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,299
Can't we decline this assignment?

3
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:15,366
Why?

4
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:20,611
He's a serial killer. He won't hesitate to kill.

5
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,578
He is the one, who planned this strike.

6
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,850
That's a guarantee of safety.

7
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:34,252
And l'm sure he knows about us, too.

8
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,828
Huh? About what?

9
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:39,229
l'm going, Raye.

10
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,460
Hey, Naomi.

11
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,696
l'll be all right, Raye.

12
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:54,377
Do you know ''takami no kenbutsu''?

13
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,812
''Takami no kenbutsu.''

14
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:39,623
Watch an event unfold as a spectator.

15
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:45,124
My intention is to fight along with them.

16
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,929
Following the B.B. case,

17
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,264
this is the 2nd time you're assigning Naomi.

18
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:55,904
You must really trust Naomi.

19
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,279
She plans to quit the F.B.l. to get married.

20
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:02,678
At such a time,
she can prove to be most effective.

21
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,883
Just like this.

22
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,957
Do you think of quitting, too?

23
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,558
Me? Quit?

24
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,398
For me...this is everything.

25
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:28,432
Watari, l'll be happy as long as you're with me.

26
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:37,317
lsn't Miss Naomi in danger?

27
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,356
12 sec. earlier than l planned. She's very good.

28
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,031
You're very good, too.

29
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,028
Thank you very much.

30
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,638
Make arrangements to go to Japan.

31
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,401
To Japan?

32
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:09,941
With 97% probability,

33
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:13,814
Kira is in Japan.

34
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:26,591
l may not be able to come back here.

35
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,717
''The person whose name
is written in the notebook... will die.''

36
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,747
''Time of death, controlled by Death Note,
is 23 days.''

37
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:19,149

38
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:22,949
BANGNUM VlLLAGE, THAlLAND

39
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:09,597
You, over there.

40
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:10,771
Yes, Sir!

41
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:16,232
Take care of that.

42
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,586
We're finished here.

43
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:49,168
BOY!

44
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,807
We've got to get out of here!
This village is over.

45
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,575
Come on. Let's go.

46
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,843
This mission is accomplished.

47
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,455
Look, sir! They're here!

48
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:13,916
Wrap it up.

49
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,829
Come on! Move out!

50
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:21,753
Sir! There is a truck moving north.

51
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,800
We don't need any witnesses or survivors.

52
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,336
Yes, Sir!

53
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,543
We're being followed.

54
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,043
Drop you off.

55
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:52,352
Find a phone and call 0105928147218.

56
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:57,420
Shit! You need to write it down, don't you.

57
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:02,965
0105928147218

58
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:06,465
Well done. Listen!

59
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:12,312
Call that number, and say F1225, OK?

60
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:17,240
This is very important.
You must call that number.

61
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,451
Watari will protect you.

62
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,657
Good luck! BOY!

63
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,483
Light Yagami...

64
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:57,201
''F dead. Biomonitor's not responding''

65
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,045
Bad news?

66
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,349
F died in Thailand.

67
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,453
lt was in the line of duty,
so it couldn't be helped but...

68
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,363
That's Misa's notebook, isn't it?

69
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,992
Whose name did you write in? Light Yagami's?

70
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,721
This is the last name to be written...

71
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:54,929
in the Death Note.

72
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:56,364
''L. Lawliet - Will quietly die...

74
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:02,900
L...

75
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:08,605
Light Yagami will attempt to kill me
with the Death Note.

76
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,386
Determine my own fate.

77
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,514
lt's the one and only way to outwit Death.

78
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:24,755
To stop the enormous evil called Kira,

79
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,334
it's a small sacrifice.

80
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,040
So, it's 23 days later.

81
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:39,735
Bring Misa Amane here.
Kira and l have a score to settle.

00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,507
Do you check your temperature?

85
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,137
Of course. Every 4 hours.

86
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,846
You told me to, dad.

87
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,288

00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:38,666
l want to take you somewhere
on your next day off.

91
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:42,774

Virus weapon sent from Thailand.

101
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,618
Virus weapon...

102
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,124
Washington wants us to examine this.

103
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:23,234
l examined it,
and discovered 2 types of virus are its roots.

104
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:29,738
Highly infectious influenza virus

105
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:33,606
was crossed with the deadly Ebola genes.

106
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,675
lt is Death itself.

107
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:40,147
lnfection rate is 100 times that of Ebola.

108
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,664
Who in the world made this?

109
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:04,667
Many countries are secretly undertaking
the development of virus weapons.

110
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,039
Some countries succeeded.

111
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,239
No, this one is a failure.

112
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:11,349
What?

113
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,988
Virus weapon is a success,
only if it comes with an antidote.

114
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:18,625
Otherwise, the user will also be infected.

115
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:24,560
l'm sure there was antidote,
but it's of no use now.

116
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,089
What do you mean?

117
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:32,233
This virus has mutated in the past 20 hours.

118
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:45,882
Mr. Watari, are you Mr. Ryuzaki's father?

119
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:48,646
No, l'm...

Burning that won't change your lifespan.

C'mon...Wait.

126
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:18,675
Light said he could be
the god of a new world with that.

127
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,972
Doesn't that interest you?

128
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:31,085
The way Light died...

129
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,094

Sorry l kept you waiting, Prof. Kagami.

134
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,759
Though we act like the ruler of Earth,

135
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:28,426
mankind cannot even imitate the basics of nature.

136
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:35,839
10 years ago,
the planet's self-recuperative power

137
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,634
would have been effective.

138
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,971
But now it is no longer...

139
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:47,249
Yes, Earth is coming to its end.

140
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:55,025
All the more,
l looked forward to cleansing Earth, that is...

141
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:58,587
by reducing humans with the virus.

142
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,729
l'm aware of that.

143
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,368
lf you are, Matoba,

144
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:15,171
why seek a buyer for that virus?

145
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:17,844
Pardon?

146
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:22,077
Union of European companies,
the American establishment,

147
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,779
and Russia.

148
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,284
You're weighing their bids.

149
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,932
ls it money you want?

150
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,732
Such greed for personal gain...

151
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:42,438
has contaminated the wealth of Earth's nature.

152
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,910
Don't you understand that?

153
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:55,118
Get out of here.

154
00:25:56,356 --> 00:26:00,292
There is no place here for the likes of you.

155
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,593
There's no place for you here.

156
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,261
Prof. Kagami.

157
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:43,934
Are you really trying to sell the virus?

158
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:47,106
You heard the originator of this plan.

159
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:51,905
The virus must be scattered
simultaneously in various areas.

160
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:54,605
To enable that...

161
00:26:54,981 --> 00:27:00,283
we need to become partners with a group
which has a global network.

162
00:27:02,155 --> 00:27:07,525
We don't need any people hesitant
of our Earth Cleansing Plan.

163
00:27:10,597 --> 00:27:12,087
Are we clear on this?

164
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,646
We're all gonna die anyway.

He's the serial killer, murdering the clergymen.

168
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:08,142
This man?

169
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:10,179
Yes.

170
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:13,821
The probability rate is 86%.

171
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:18,430
lf he's the culprit,
he hides souvenirs in the crypt under the church.

172
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:19,723
Yes, sir.

173
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,769
Concerning Princess Joanne's death...

174
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,601
l have evidence that it was not accident
but assassination.

175
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:35,074
l see. Please send the data right away.

176
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:36,508
l will.

177
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,389
The leader of the arms syndicate, Rod Ross.

178
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:58,362
He deals with the mafia
at the Far East underground market once a month.

179
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:01,070
Most of the arms go to the Middle East.

180
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:04,607
Fifty AK47s. When is the next trade?

181
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:06,142
Next Saturday.

182
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:16,153
14 DAYS LEFT

183
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:37,909
You can't make a call unless you put in money.

184
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:22,649
Phone call from Chaiang Mai. lt's for Watari.

185
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,020
l, L will take that call.

186
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:37,202
F1225... F1225...

187
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:39,530
A gift from F.

188
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,938
l'll accept the gift.

189
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:29,351
12 DAYS LEFT

190
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:15,430
Although he's scared, he's physically sound.

191
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:18,195
Why was he the only one not infected?

192
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:21,099
l don't know.

193
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:26,704
Unless we find a countermeasure,
the virus will be used again.

194
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:30,211
And in the near future.

195
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:34,778
10 DAYS LEFT

196
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:08,315
8 DAYS LEFT

197
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,174
This Room...

198
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,013
is only for Watari and l.

199
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,519
May l take a look?

200
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:43,315
My first babysitting experience...

201
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:49,420
doesn't seem to work out.

202
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:31,446
Maki, welcome home. Did you have a good day?

203
00:36:47,974 --> 00:36:50,033
Mom.

204
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,145
Maki.

205
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,179
l need a favor.

206
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:04,056
What?

207
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,350
Please deliver this to him.

208
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,358
The address is in here.

209
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,400
Him? Who is it?

210
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:25,704
He's the answer to this.

211
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:28,514
Homework was well done.

212
00:37:30,149 --> 00:37:31,741
Naturally.

213
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:40,283
And...This is your new homework.

214
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:44,256
Again?

215
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:46,726
l'm well aware.

216
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:52,370
that ''if it's difficult,
it's worth the challenge.''

217
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,579
Now, off with you.

218
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,477
Dr. Kujo.

219
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,212
Yes?

220
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:39,217
Can you stay? l'd like to talk to you.

221
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,443
Fine with me. What is it?

222
00:38:41,854 --> 00:38:43,151
Meet me in P-4.

223
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,453
Yes, l will.

224
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:57,601
Mr. Matoba, please.

225
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:21,452
Watari.

226
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:25,488
While l was working undercover
on the bio-terrorism attack in the village.

227
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:28,790
l met a boy who doesn't seem to be affected
by the virus.

228
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:31,626
The virus is devastating this village.

229
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,899
lt is extremely dangerous and fatal.

230
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:45,379
l am going to give the boy the contact information
for Wammy's headquarters.

231
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:49,384
The attack is connected
with the global terrorist network.

232
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:54,686
This Japanese man ''Matoba'' is a key person
to this investigation.

233
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:05,828
VlRl AND BACTERlA lNFECTlONS

234
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,481
May l help you?

235
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:08,198
Sorry to bother you at this hour, but we're...

236
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,898
such people.

237
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:36,588
Why are you here?

238
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:09,652
Dr. Kujo.

239
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,693
How can l help you?

240
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:19,168
Oh, it's you.

241
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,969
Examined the culture fluid of that virus.

242
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:26,869
The ingredients matched those l mixed.

243
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:31,277
ln other words,
that virus was created in this lab.

244
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:37,851
What is this? Who are you? Why're you doing this?

245
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,591
We are people who grieve the future of Earth.

246
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:45,230
Earth's ecosystem will be destroyed.

247
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:50,328
The human specie has increased excessively.

248
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:55,838
Don't you understand?

249
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:01,939
lf there are too many,
all we do is decreasing that number.

250
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:06,951
Virus weapon for that? That is so foolish!

251
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,785
Dr. Kujo, don't tell me you agree with him.

252
00:43:14,994 --> 00:43:17,622
You're intelligent and decent.

253
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:21,863
l am...the originator of this plan.

254
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:29,768
By the excessive increase of humans,
earth is now at peril.

255
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:34,243
l will eliminate useless human beings

256
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:38,515
to create a new world and its ecosystem.

257
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,347
How could you...?

258
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:47,926
Prof., l didn't intend to tell you so soon.

259
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:51,993
l wanted you to concentrate on developing
the antidote for that virus.

260
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:00,397
What's the matter?

261
00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:04,405
l knew it.

262
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:08,445
You've succeeded.

263
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:01,132
This is the only antidote.

264
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:05,861
l've deleted all the data.

265
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,609
l'm going to incinerate this, too.

266
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:16,872
Professor.

267
00:45:26,258 --> 00:45:29,091
Without this, you can't spread the virus.

268
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:30,885
Prof. Nikaido.

269
00:45:31,864 --> 00:45:32,990
Hand it over.

270
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:33,823
No.

271
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:35,625
Prof., don't do it.

272
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,071
Bring the professor's daughter.

273
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,782
Why my daughter?

274
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:59,655
Which is more precious?
Your daughter or antidote data?

275
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:07,558
Go.

276
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:17,397
Wait!

277
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:31,215
l guess there's no alternative.

278
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:26,940
Why that virus?

279
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:39,481
Professor!

280
00:47:46,665 --> 00:47:50,192
Dr. Kujo.

281
00:47:52,104 --> 00:47:56,768
You have overcome the weakness
of the virus weapon.

282
00:47:59,578 --> 00:48:03,105
Virus will not onset immediately.

283
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:08,615
Because of this,
it was said that virus cannot be a weapon.

284
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,647
But you have...

285
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:15,791
The new world needs people like you, professor.

286
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,992
Need?

287
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:29,869
l do not want to be chosen by people like you.

288
00:48:36,715 --> 00:48:38,444
Have P-4...

289
00:48:40,252 --> 00:48:46,555
incinerated in the plasma furnace.

290
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:49,689
This virus...

291
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:54,964
eats through the epidemic prevention filter.

292
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:38,261
Thank you!

293
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:51,745
- Hey, what's up?
- Please. Drive.

294
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,518
Where to?

295
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,066
Go to all these addresses.

296
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:28,777
You said the antidote data is here.

297
00:51:28,987 --> 00:51:30,420
Please look for it.

298
00:51:32,524 --> 00:51:35,550

299
00:51:47,406 --> 00:51:48,600

00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:04,848

00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:16,193
''HOPE''

Maki, welcome home. Did you have a good day?

308
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:07,347
Maki, welcome home.

309
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:13,919
Clear these.

310
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:20,325
- Mustn't communicate now.
- Get back.

311
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,670
l'm K. How do you do? You're L?

312
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,937
Yes, you're right.

313
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:45,088
l'm L. How do you do?

314
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:50,387
Thank you for letting me know about Watari.
You surprised me.

315
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:53,257
ls anything wrong?

316
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:56,395
l'm working on infectious disease.

317
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:03,797
Something happened, and l need your help.

318
00:54:04,276 --> 00:54:05,709
My help? Why?

319
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:09,703
A new, devastating virus was discovered.

320
00:54:10,015 --> 00:54:14,384
But my partner who developed
the antidote was murdered.

321
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:19,250
The data is missing, and l want you to find it.

322
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:25,128
Mankind must be saved.

323
00:54:26,398 --> 00:54:30,232
l see. You must provide me with the details.

324
00:54:30,535 --> 00:54:33,060
Please come over at noon tomorrow?

325
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:36,300
Yes, l will. Tell me where to go.

326
00:54:37,175 --> 00:54:38,870
l'll send you a map.

327
00:54:47,185 --> 00:54:48,482

00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,548
A formidable foe.

331
00:55:56,488 --> 00:55:58,456
Maki took the data with her.

332
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:01,050
The data will come here.

333

00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,566
Ah...Excuse me.

335
00:56:14,673 --> 00:56:15,731
Can l help you?

336
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:22,042
l was told to show you this.

337
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,205
l have no idea what that is.

338
00:56:27,352 --> 00:56:30,219
So this isn't it, either. Darn.

339
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:32,679
What's the matter?

340
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:39,260
l've been driving all night from yesterday.
l've really had it.

341
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:44,093
Only talks to her bear. l give up.

342
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:45,593
Bear?

343
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:50,273
A teddy bear. The passenger is a girl.

344
00:56:52,644 --> 00:56:55,442
She's looking for a man named Watari.

345
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:57,781
l guess this isn't it, either.

346
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,145
Thank you for your time.

347
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,621
Would you please let that girl in?

348
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,631
What is that?

349
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,230
Some medicine?

350
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:23,434
No, this is a virus.

351
00:57:24,209 --> 00:57:25,107
A virus?

352
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,277
Yes.

353
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:32,479
At all costs, no one must possess the antidote.

354
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:37,519
One who possesses
it will be invincible to the virus weapon.

355
00:57:37,722 --> 00:57:43,285
That's why Prof. Nikaido
entrusted Watari with this virus

356
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:46,764
and destroyed the only antidote he developed

357
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:51,131
along with himself.

358
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:27,965
Have a bite.

359
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:51,054
What time is it?

360
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:54,161
lt's 8:00.

361
00:59:14,686 --> 00:59:16,620
My dad's orders.

362
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:25,850
lt's unlocked.

363
01:00:27,558 --> 01:00:28,354
Good.

364
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:17,798
Maki!

365
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:21,938
What your dad confided in you...

366
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:24,137
was the wrong item.

367
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:27,477
He needs that badly. Can you give it back?

368
01:01:30,555 --> 01:01:31,544
So, that's it.

369
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:32,949
K...

370
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:38,720
Or shall l call you Dr. Kimiko Kujo.

371
01:01:39,497 --> 01:01:41,727
The appointed time is noon.

372
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:46,332
You seem to have found out my name.

373
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:49,901
Then, l want you to show your face.

374
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:55,936
Watari was very proud of you.

375
01:01:57,348 --> 01:02:00,715
l'm sure he still feels that way.

376
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:39,385
Don't think he can save you.

377
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:42,555
He has his weak points, too.

378
01:02:43,394 --> 01:02:46,727
Some things can't be solved up here.

379
01:02:52,904 --> 01:02:54,303
Let me go.

380
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,165
Let me go.

381
01:03:19,664 --> 01:03:20,824
Maki.

382
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:26,896
What the hell...

383
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:41,885
Murderer!

384
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,580
l saw it all.

385
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:53,723
You should bleed and die like my dad.

386
01:04:07,712 --> 01:04:10,579
lndeed, that is my weak point.

387
01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:14,709
Let me go. You'll be infected.

388
01:04:15,253 --> 01:04:16,584
Let me go.

389
01:04:19,323 --> 01:04:20,915
Let me go.

390
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:23,487
Let me go.

391
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:44,241
l'll kill her. l'll kill her with the virus.

392
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:54,554
Let me go.

393
01:05:24,155 --> 01:05:25,554
F.B.l, Suruga.

394
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:29,117
After Watari's death, we'll protect you.

395
01:05:32,363 --> 01:05:33,921
That's encouraging.

396
01:05:34,465 --> 01:05:36,296
- This way.
- No!

397
01:05:38,603 --> 01:05:41,003
The Countermeasure Transfer Room is in here.

398
01:05:50,181 --> 01:05:52,672
What in the world is this?

399
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:55,409
Crepe...

400
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:07,528
Please drive.

401
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:22,671
Didn't the girl have the virus?

402
01:06:24,015 --> 01:06:26,245
What happened to the antidote data?

403
01:06:32,423 --> 01:06:34,618
Don't tell me it doesn't exist.

404
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:37,721
What's our next move?

405
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:40,889
You're the developer. We can make the virus.

406
01:06:41,499 --> 01:06:44,468
But it's useless without the antidote.

407
01:06:45,569 --> 01:06:46,729
You're right.

408
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:24,841
He's ahead of us.

409
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:28,668
Shut down all L's access from the outside.

410
01:07:29,347 --> 01:07:30,279
Yes, ma'am.

411
01:07:39,657 --> 01:07:43,889
l can kill anyone l want now...

412
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:50,798
Do you think your dad sent you
to Watari for that purpose?

413
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:59,000
Dad is...dad is dead.

414
01:08:27,638 --> 01:08:31,301
You know this Watari person, don't you?

415
01:08:31,509 --> 01:08:34,603
Yes. l am L.

416
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:37,575
L...

417
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:50,155
They call themselves ''Blue Ship''...

418
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:53,263
an environmental group.

419
01:08:53,898 --> 01:08:58,665
That man with a scar is an extremist
using that as his cover.

420
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:02,402
But K is not a group member.

421
01:09:04,008 --> 01:09:05,566
- Mr. Suruga.
- What?

422
01:09:05,776 --> 01:09:08,711
Turn left 30m ahead. We're getting out.

423
01:09:08,913 --> 01:09:11,347
- 30m...
- Over here.

424
01:09:11,549 --> 01:09:13,244
Here?

425
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:24,025
Let's go.

426
01:09:30,968 --> 01:09:32,765
Let's meet here 2 hours later.

427
01:09:33,471 --> 01:09:36,031
Drive on as fast as you like.

428
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,036
That means...

429
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:44,845
Am l a decoy?

430
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:49,971
Damn! They're persistent.

431
01:10:57,922 --> 01:10:59,549
What the hell are you doing?

432
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,247
This is a one-way street. Stop.

433
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:10,757
What're you doing?
l told you to stop, you bastard.

434
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:23,710
l said it's a one-way street. Stop.

435
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:28,579
l said it's a one-way street. Stop.

436
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,649
Let me through. F.B.l. business.

437
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:38,157
So what? Get out. You're Japanese, aren't you?

438
01:11:38,362 --> 01:11:39,886
Look. F.B.l.

439
01:11:40,097 --> 01:11:42,998
You're Japanese. You can't fool me.

440
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:57,637
Welcome, master.

441
01:11:57,948 --> 01:11:59,609
Sorry l kept you waiting.

442
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,479
Please enjoy, master.

443
01:12:14,932 --> 01:12:16,160
He's strange.

444
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:20,895
Easy to call him that.

445
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:29,870
They're Fibonacci Numbers.
He's a mathematical genius.

446
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:33,338
He's F's...

447
01:12:34,752 --> 01:12:36,686
A gift Watari left me.

448
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:46,024
By the way, the virus you had seems to be...

449
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:48,097
a fake.

450
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:49,826
That's impossible.

451
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:54,432
Your dad was infected right after contact.

452
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,939
Your body temperature shows no change.

453
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:00,703
Body temperature?

454
01:13:12,122 --> 01:13:16,525
That might be the reason.

455
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,228
Maki received an injection every 10 days.

456
01:13:27,938 --> 01:13:31,430
Dad didn't tell me what the injection was.

457
01:13:32,509 --> 01:13:34,409
l see. You're saying the virus is restrained

458
01:13:35,112 --> 01:13:36,841
because of the injection.

459
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:40,946
lt can't be anything else.

460
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,818
Does it mean Maki's body has both...

461
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:49,649
the virus and the hint to restrain the virus?

462
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,159
All the more, we must get her.

463
01:13:54,665 --> 01:13:56,326
- You go, too.
- Wait.

464
01:13:57,501 --> 01:13:59,128
Let's change our plan.

465
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,162
We don't have much time.

466
01:14:02,573 --> 01:14:05,542
lt seems we don't have much time.

467
01:14:13,016 --> 01:14:15,041
Don't worry about it.

468
01:14:16,086 --> 01:14:18,884
l, too, need to settle this in 6 days.

469
01:14:23,694 --> 01:14:26,390
Did she inject the virus by herself?

470
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,894
Yes, she did.

471
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,028
Don't worry. ln the dormant stage,

472
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:36,497
no virus will be a threat.

473
01:14:38,776 --> 01:14:39,800
l see...

474
01:14:41,011 --> 01:14:43,912
But before the virus takes effect,

475
01:14:44,782 --> 01:14:47,012
we need to travel a bit far.

476
01:14:47,751 --> 01:14:49,150
With her?

477
01:14:50,387 --> 01:14:53,845
lf the virus awakens, we'll be infected first.

478
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:57,154
We probably will.

479
01:14:59,363 --> 01:15:00,125
''L. Lawliet - Will quietly die...''

480
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,059
''of heart attack 23 days later.''

481
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:08,662
Perhaps it won't be as ''quietly'' as l hope to.

482
01:15:12,943 --> 01:15:17,277
Leave the rest to the F.B.l.

483
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,754
Thank you. ln that case, Mr. Suruga,

484
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:28,847
l need a favor.

485
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:33,056
Anything for you.

486
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:43,233
Damn.

487
01:15:43,674 --> 01:15:45,801
Made me a decoy again.

488
01:16:06,263 --> 01:16:07,560
Where're we going?

489
01:16:08,799 --> 01:16:11,893
To a man named Koichi Matsudo.

490
01:16:13,704 --> 01:16:14,932
Prof. Matsudo?

491
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:20,834
l've met him before. But why do you know him?

492
01:16:23,647 --> 01:16:28,846
When l looked at the book on
lnfectious Disease Center, his name and...

493
01:16:29,653 --> 01:16:32,178
your dad's were there as co-writers.

494
01:16:33,624 --> 01:16:35,649
''KOlCHl MATSUDO'' ''KlMlHlKO NlKAlDO''

495
01:16:41,131 --> 01:16:45,693
We interrupt this program for emergency news.

496
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:49,663
A girl infected by a dangerous virus.

497
01:16:49,873 --> 01:16:53,934
has escaped from a hospital.

498
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:59,415
We have Dr. Kujo of the
lnfectious Disease Center here.

499
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:02,717
Dr. Kujo, what kind of a virus is this?

500
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:07,254
This virus is extremely infectious and...

501
01:17:07,591 --> 01:17:11,186
there is no effective vaccine yet.

502
01:17:11,528 --> 01:17:14,622
lf symptoms appear, recovery is impossible.

503
01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:17,365
l can say the virus is lethal.

504
01:17:17,668 --> 01:17:22,128
This is Maki Nikaido, who is currently missing.

505
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:27,373
She is 12 years old
and goes to a school in Saitama.

506
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:30,074
Body height 150cm.

507
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,508
lmpossible.

508
01:17:31,715 --> 01:17:36,482
She was last seen wearing
a navy blue school uniform.

509
01:17:49,566 --> 01:17:52,592
Let's get off.
Can't use public transport anymore.

510
01:18:22,733 --> 01:18:28,535
A girl infected by a lethal virus
got off the train at this station.

511
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:31,766
The virus could be airborne.

512
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:35,374
We are undertaking an infection test.

513
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:40,182
Please cooperate to prevent the virus
from spreading.

514
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:43,114
Please. We need your cooperation.

515
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:49,115
We are looking for this girl.

516
01:18:49,326 --> 01:18:51,590
Witness reports on the girl
infected by the virus.

517
01:19:19,656 --> 01:19:21,624
Approximately 30,000.

518
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,719
We need some time to verify them.

519
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:12,635
L...

520
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:18,347
l'm really tired, L.

521
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:16,199
lt's ok. l knew this would happen

522
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:36,484
Suruga, haven't you recovered Death Note yet?

523
01:21:36,693 --> 01:21:39,685
L and l are moving separately now.

524
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:42,660
Separately? What do you mean?

525
01:21:42,933 --> 01:21:45,026
To gain L's trust.

526
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:47,429
Why moving separately for that?

527
01:21:47,637 --> 01:21:52,301
But l promise to accomplish my mission.

528
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:01,983
5 DAYS LEFT

529
01:23:13,356 --> 01:23:14,618
You bastard.

530
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:20,287
Move around with a virus infected person?

531
01:23:21,698 --> 01:23:26,465
lt's common sense to avoid
densely populated areas.

532
01:23:28,305 --> 01:23:30,296
lf the symptoms appeared?

533
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:39,373
Not just Maki,
but everybody around her will be involved.

534
01:23:43,253 --> 01:23:47,155
Are you listening?

535
01:24:03,273 --> 01:24:05,138
Absolutely irresponsible.

536
01:24:10,013 --> 01:24:11,139
What is it?

537
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,685
Quarantine me.

538
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:32,863
Have the symptoms...?

539
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,878
You're all right.

540
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:47,115
You must've run through the woods.

541
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:50,610
lt's a tick bite.

542
01:24:56,459 --> 01:24:57,926
Come with me.

543
01:25:03,032 --> 01:25:04,624
What d'you plan to do?

544
01:25:05,535 --> 01:25:07,503
Maki is fighting that horror.

545
01:25:07,704 --> 01:25:13,040
That's why we need someone
who can make the antidote.

546
01:25:13,877 --> 01:25:14,809
l can't.

547
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:17,377
Prof. Nikaido could, though.

548
01:25:19,516 --> 01:25:20,847
l'm...

549
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:24,411
l'm scared.

550
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,288
The vaccine l developed killed people.

551
01:25:31,428 --> 01:25:33,760
So, l'm scared.

552
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:38,931
There are lives l have sacrificed, too.

553
01:25:40,103 --> 01:25:41,468
But now,

554
01:25:43,106 --> 01:25:45,506
l can't abandon the life before me.

555
01:25:55,752 --> 01:25:56,912
Hi, Mr. Noda.

556
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,384
Oh, hi, Prof. Matsudo.

557
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:10,790
l'll be using the lab again.

558
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,664
l hope you have permission from the professor?

559
01:26:55,411 --> 01:26:59,074
4 DAYS LEFT

560
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:23,658
3 DAYS LEFT

561
01:28:29,739 --> 01:28:31,604
Find out anything?

562
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:42,550
lt's energy source is sugar.

563
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:45,277
lt likes sugar, but not fruit sugar.

564
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,057
Sugar?

565
01:28:51,594 --> 01:28:54,028
Maki basically has low blood sugar.

566
01:28:56,666 --> 01:29:01,103
The virus probably wasn't active inside her

567
01:29:02,872 --> 01:29:04,669
because of that.

568
01:29:05,808 --> 01:29:08,709
Not because of her dad's injection?

569
01:29:10,213 --> 01:29:13,478
The injection was probably for her
low blood sugar.

570
01:29:16,753 --> 01:29:22,020
Does determining the energy source
help in developing the antidote?

571
01:29:23,593 --> 01:29:24,582
No.

572
01:29:26,996 --> 01:29:31,160
Destroying the sugar in the body
will kill the virus,

573
01:29:33,069 --> 01:29:36,664
but that would stop the body activity.

574
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,243
13:11

575
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:48,475
What?

576
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,790
Please be quiet for a while.

577
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:22,178
What is that?

578
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,455
M... K

579
01:30:33,529 --> 01:30:34,860
So, what is it?

580
01:30:35,565 --> 01:30:36,589
lt's a code.

581
01:30:36,799 --> 01:30:39,427
But where did you see this?

582
01:30:39,702 --> 01:30:43,502
That's the homework my dad gave me.

583
01:30:53,382 --> 01:30:56,180
lt's a message from Prof. Nikaido.

584
01:30:58,888 --> 01:31:01,152
What could MK mean?

585
01:31:08,798 --> 01:31:10,322
Prof. Matsudo. Tell me if any word

586
01:31:10,533 --> 01:31:12,091
draws your attention.

587
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,347
... Midkine

588
01:31:26,115 --> 01:31:27,207
That's it.

589
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:33,755
Midkine may be able to suppress the virus.

590
01:31:34,123 --> 01:31:36,819
So that's what it is.

591
01:31:37,026 --> 01:31:40,120
lt's a protein, which creates and breeds cells.

592
01:31:40,396 --> 01:31:43,854
Restores broken cells
and stops cancer from progressing.

593
01:31:44,066 --> 01:31:49,197
Restores nerve cells,
so it may be a wonder drug for Alzheimer.

594
01:31:52,942 --> 01:31:57,538
ls it possible to artificially synthesize Midkine?

595
01:31:58,381 --> 01:32:02,943
Yes, with 10 billion yen research fee and 5 years.

596
01:32:05,488 --> 01:32:07,183
5 years...

597
01:32:09,225 --> 01:32:12,888
But l'll think of some ways to do that.

598
01:32:15,064 --> 01:32:16,588
For example,

599
01:32:18,901 --> 01:32:22,234
Midkine is abundant in a fetus.

600
01:32:30,246 --> 01:32:31,873
lt has to be a fetus.

601
01:32:35,451 --> 01:32:39,945
He's a survivor of the village
destroyed by that virus.

602
01:32:43,092 --> 01:32:44,252
He was examined,

603
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:49,227
but not for MK proteins.

604
01:32:57,907 --> 01:33:01,343
Let me take some of your blood.

605
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:18,922
Ah, that feels good.

606
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:25,164
There will be a series of tests from tomorrow.

607
01:33:27,303 --> 01:33:28,634
l know that.

608
01:33:38,714 --> 01:33:40,272
C'mon. Let's eat.

609
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:41,708
Wait.

610
01:34:08,878 --> 01:34:10,402
Let's eat.

611
01:34:10,846 --> 01:34:12,040
Let's eat.

612
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:25,416
Why do you only eat sweets?

613
01:34:26,529 --> 01:34:30,932
Sugar is an essential energy source
of the brain and...

614
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:32,657
Over eating is bad.

615
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:35,667
You'll die.

616
01:34:39,976 --> 01:34:41,568
You may be right.

617
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:44,507
You should...

618
01:34:45,915 --> 01:34:48,145
straighten your back, too.

619
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:02,919
l'm going to the bathroom.

620
01:37:48,297 --> 01:37:49,491
Maki.

621
01:37:52,601 --> 01:37:54,000
Thanks for the call.

622
01:38:18,994 --> 01:38:19,983
l'll kill you.

623
01:38:21,897 --> 01:38:24,730
Can't kill you when the antidote is made.

624
01:38:26,168 --> 01:38:27,658
l'll kill you before that.

625
01:38:36,579 --> 01:38:41,016
Sorry. l broke the promise to come alone.

626
01:38:44,019 --> 01:38:45,316
You coward!

627
01:39:35,271 --> 01:39:40,368
They are searching for the reason
why symptoms don't appear on Maki

628
01:39:41,377 --> 01:39:43,538
to develop the antidote.

629
01:39:43,846 --> 01:39:45,177
No, Dr. Kujo's aware...

630
01:39:45,914 --> 01:39:49,645
Maki's symptoms can appear any time.

631
01:39:50,686 --> 01:39:53,018
Then, why take Maki?

632
01:39:54,123 --> 01:39:58,457
Maki is a perfect vessel
for secretly carrying the virus.

633
01:40:03,632 --> 01:40:07,090
Please continue to work on the antidote.

634
01:40:09,038 --> 01:40:10,938
We'll need a lot of it.

635
01:40:21,183 --> 01:40:22,445
You know what to do?

636
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:28,782
Wait a minute.

637
01:40:48,744 --> 01:40:50,473
ls it finished?

638
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,672
Hasn't been tested yet.

639
01:40:55,584 --> 01:40:56,949
You're incredible.

640
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,817
l'll get to work.

641
01:41:01,557 --> 01:41:03,525
and make as much as l can.

642
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:10,529
Please do so.

643
01:41:23,345 --> 01:41:28,009
l didn't expect a child
to stake her life for revenge.

644
01:41:31,253 --> 01:41:33,778
Her dad was killed before her eyes.

645
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:36,655
Can't blame her.

646
01:41:42,464 --> 01:41:44,227
You may be right.

647
01:41:53,742 --> 01:41:56,176
lf Kujo is escaping from Japan,

648
01:41:57,079 --> 01:42:01,345
does that mean they've developed the antidote?

649
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:03,848
No. By taking Maki,

650
01:42:04,153 --> 01:42:09,022
she deceives the Blue Ship members
that the antidote is completed.

651
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:15,423
How does Kujo intend to scatter the virus?

652
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:20,559
They could disguise as a emergency patient
and medical staff.

653
01:42:20,869 --> 01:42:23,235
lt has less procedure to clear the
boarding procedure. They can easily board a plane.

654
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:26,033
Then, hijack the plane.

655
01:42:26,842 --> 01:42:28,901
- To where?
- Probably to the U.S.

656
01:42:30,045 --> 01:42:31,307
To the U.S.?

657
01:42:31,513 --> 01:42:34,209
Matoba may have chosen the destination.

658
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:39,553
As you said,
Matoba uses the ecology group as his front.

659
01:42:40,322 --> 01:42:43,416
Matoba has no principles, just greed.

660
01:42:44,326 --> 01:42:49,389
People with greed will head
for the most profitable country.

661
01:42:50,566 --> 01:42:54,400
2 DAYS LEFT

662
01:42:57,873 --> 01:42:59,932
Please.

663
01:43:02,544 --> 01:43:04,409
JNA flight 204, right?

664
01:43:05,481 --> 01:43:09,247
Attending personnel are Dr. Kimiko Kujo...

665
01:43:09,451 --> 01:43:11,976
And myself, Daisuke Matoba.

666
01:43:12,588 --> 01:43:13,953
Let me see the papers.

667
01:43:25,701 --> 01:43:27,931
ls she Mayumi Honda?

668
01:43:28,136 --> 01:43:29,000
Yes.

669
01:43:30,072 --> 01:43:32,336
l wish for a successful operation.

670
01:43:47,723 --> 01:43:50,886
Good morning.
Thank you for boarding JNA flight 204.

671
01:43:54,196 --> 01:43:57,996
l burned Death Note. l no longer have it.

672
01:43:58,634 --> 01:44:01,899
l'm sorry l couldn't help your mission.

673
01:44:02,704 --> 01:44:03,693
l see...

674
01:44:08,443 --> 01:44:09,671
But l...

675
01:44:10,712 --> 01:44:11,679
L

676
01:44:13,248 --> 01:44:15,580
l want to help you.

677
01:44:49,051 --> 01:44:51,144
Good morning, passengers.

678
01:44:51,486 --> 01:44:55,752
This is your captain, Saito.
A message from Control Room.

679
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:59,728
We are ready to take off,

680
01:44:59,728 --> 01:45:00,922
but have just received...

681
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:02,460
a report from the control tower.

682
01:45:02,898 --> 01:45:05,890
A suspicious vehicle is in the runway.

683
01:45:06,635 --> 01:45:11,436
We have been requested to be on standby
at this location.

684
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:14,734
We will inform you of any further development.

685
01:45:14,943 --> 01:45:16,501
We appreciate your patience.

686
01:45:17,245 --> 01:45:18,803
Thank you for your cooperation.

687
01:45:28,457 --> 01:45:30,721
- What're you doing?
- Make way.

688
01:45:32,194 --> 01:45:33,161
Make way.

689
01:45:40,502 --> 01:45:41,833
Anything wrong?

690
01:46:02,891 --> 01:46:03,823
Don't move.

691
01:46:05,494 --> 01:46:06,825
What's going on?

692
01:46:07,195 --> 01:46:10,130
We only take action above the U.S.

693
01:46:10,465 --> 01:46:11,659
Don't be so rigid.

694
01:46:13,168 --> 01:46:14,760
Change in schedule.

695
01:46:26,815 --> 01:46:28,942
We'll be safe, right?

696
01:46:29,851 --> 01:46:31,443
You'll soon find out.

697
01:46:33,822 --> 01:46:35,221
What d'you mean?

698
01:46:38,026 --> 01:46:39,960
Didn't we have an injection?

699
01:46:41,463 --> 01:46:44,023
l didn't make any antidote.

700
01:46:49,037 --> 01:46:51,028
You tricked us?

701
01:46:51,573 --> 01:46:55,373
A buyer's paying $10 million
for the virus and the antidote.

702
01:46:55,911 --> 01:46:57,572
Your true aim.

703
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:03,312
Wait a minute. We'll all die.

704
01:47:03,518 --> 01:47:06,146
lf you're gonna die, die alone.

705
01:47:16,364 --> 01:47:17,831
We'll all die.

706
01:47:23,305 --> 01:47:25,603
l don't wanna die. Help me.

707
01:47:25,807 --> 01:47:32,804
Dr. Kujo, help me. Help me.

708
01:47:49,231 --> 01:47:49,925
Captain.

709
01:47:52,834 --> 01:47:56,235
Oh, no. The girl on TV is on this plane.

710
01:47:56,505 --> 01:47:57,529
What's wrong?

711
01:48:15,023 --> 01:48:15,955
All right?

712
01:48:17,058 --> 01:48:17,990
Be quiet.

713
01:48:24,065 --> 01:48:26,590
Earth is finished anyway.

714
01:48:30,806 --> 01:48:32,034
Take off.

715
01:48:32,541 --> 01:48:34,668
Finished...Damn.

716
01:48:36,945 --> 01:48:38,105
So, we're finished.

717
01:48:39,047 --> 01:48:40,537
Don't move.

718
01:48:47,189 --> 01:48:48,121
Stop it.

719
01:49:04,372 --> 01:49:05,532
lt's moving.

720
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:27,217
Hey, hang on.

721
01:50:30,926 --> 01:50:32,393
Don't mind them.

722
01:50:33,028 --> 01:50:37,226
lt's merely a minor sacrifice for a big purpose.

723
01:50:38,166 --> 01:50:38,962
Whatever...

724
01:50:40,368 --> 01:50:44,896
the reason may be, murder is always a bad thing.

725
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:53,510
Too bad. lt's too late now.

726
01:50:53,715 --> 01:50:55,148
lt's not too late.

727
01:50:58,653 --> 01:51:00,348
The antidote.

728
01:51:03,391 --> 01:51:05,382
We've succeeded.

729
01:51:05,927 --> 01:51:09,021
We can save them all.

730
01:51:42,464 --> 01:51:44,728
lnject this to everyone.

731
01:51:49,571 --> 01:51:51,095
You've done enough damage.

732
01:51:56,611 --> 01:51:58,272
We don't need that.

733
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:02,610
This girl and everyone else here can die.

734
01:52:13,895 --> 01:52:18,059
Like she said, we'll all die.

735
01:52:19,734 --> 01:52:24,694
Mankind, which destroys environment
and wages war, should die.

736
01:52:25,073 --> 01:52:28,008
Correct ecosystem will save the world.

737
01:52:28,276 --> 01:52:32,679
ls this what Watari hoped for?

738
01:53:00,608 --> 01:53:03,042
He said: ''Make the world better.''

739
01:53:03,311 --> 01:53:08,374
So, destroy mankind. You must take over this plan.

740
01:53:08,616 --> 01:53:09,913
l decline.

741
01:53:10,819 --> 01:53:14,983
Mankind must have the power to change its future.

742
01:53:20,161 --> 01:53:21,628
lt's too late.

743
01:53:22,497 --> 01:53:26,524
The plane will fly. Everybody dies,
and the virus will scatter.

744
01:53:26,734 --> 01:53:27,701
No.

745
01:53:29,871 --> 01:53:33,773
The magnetic wave of
this is enough to crash the plane.

746
01:53:34,008 --> 01:53:37,569
The virus will fall into the sea
and become harmless.

747
01:53:38,179 --> 01:53:39,806
lt's checkmate.

748
01:53:43,284 --> 01:53:46,549
lf you're alive, you can start over.

749
01:53:46,754 --> 01:53:51,054
No one has the right to take that away.

750
01:53:52,961 --> 01:53:54,724
Start over...

751
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:08,907
By my contract with Death, l'll die 2 days later.

752
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:10,941
Death...

753
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,507
You must live on.

754
01:54:13,982 --> 01:54:17,076
lt's Watari's wish.

755
01:54:41,809 --> 01:54:43,106
lnject these to everyone.

756
01:54:43,311 --> 01:54:44,278
OK.

757
01:54:48,416 --> 01:54:49,405
All right?

758
01:54:51,186 --> 01:54:53,381
Enough antidote for everyone.

759
01:54:54,856 --> 01:54:55,686
OK.

760
01:54:56,357 --> 01:54:57,688
Hurry. Take these.

761
01:56:20,875 --> 01:56:21,933
What will you do?

762
01:56:51,539 --> 01:56:52,801
l'm okay.

763
01:56:57,578 --> 01:56:59,011
l'm okay now.

764
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:09,381
You're a good girl. l believed in you.

765
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:30,635
l am honored to work under

766
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:35,673
the command of the legendary L.

767
01:58:37,845 --> 01:58:39,745
l was not in command.

768
01:58:42,283 --> 01:58:44,877
Mr. Suruga, l'm glad l trusted you.

769
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:47,711
Thank you very much.

770
01:58:58,599 --> 01:59:01,591
l still have 2 more days.

771
01:59:43,544 --> 01:59:45,341
This is from L.

772
01:59:56,491 --> 01:59:58,959
Maki, welcome home.

773
02:00:00,328 --> 02:00:02,125
Did you have a good day?

774
02:00:10,938 --> 02:00:12,166
Yes.

775
02:00:14,141 --> 02:00:16,166
The 5 days were good.

776
02:00:17,311 --> 02:00:19,575
Maki, welcome home.

777
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:25,312
Make tomorrow a good day, too.

778
02:00:36,831 --> 02:00:38,526
Same to you.

779
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:41,666
L...

780
02:01:14,902 --> 02:01:18,269
1 DAY LEFT

781
02:01:18,873 --> 02:01:20,135
ls this him?

782
02:01:20,441 --> 02:01:21,237
Yes.

783
02:01:25,146 --> 02:01:29,674
There is one thing l want you to remember.

784
02:01:31,752 --> 02:01:33,583
No matter how gifted,

785
02:01:33,955 --> 02:01:36,788
you alone cannot change the world.

786
02:01:39,727 --> 02:01:44,460
But that's the wonderful thing about this world.

787
02:01:48,135 --> 02:01:50,569
l will give a name to this boy.

788
02:01:51,038 --> 02:01:54,007
Watari would've wanted you to do so.

789
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:06,151
''Near'' is a good name.

790
02:02:07,088 --> 02:02:10,922
You will always be near when someone is saved.

791
02:02:31,345 --> 02:02:34,678
Find happiness, ''Near''.

792
02:03:18,492 --> 02:03:19,618
Watari.

793
02:03:20,695 --> 02:03:22,094
l want to live

794
02:03:23,664 --> 02:03:27,794
a little bit more in this world.

795
02:08:27,167 --> 02:08:30,227
''RESTS lN PEACE''
