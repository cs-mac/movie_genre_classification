1
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,512
- <i>So, why do it?
- 'Cause it's dangerous.</i>

2
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:38,401
<i>Like you can sprain
a tit or something.</i>

3
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,975
<i>This is the most dangerous sport
in American high school, bitch.</i>

4
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:44,177
<i>More dangerous than football?</i>

5
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:47,845
<i>More catastrophic
injuries per student.</i>

6
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,350
<i>- How do I look?
- Dangerous.</i>

7
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,486
<i>Duh.</i>

8
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,662
<i>Take me through a typical Thursday.</i>

9
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,298
<i>Well, first I get up at
the ass crack for my run.</i>

10
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:08,134
<i>I mean, obviously staying in
shape is a part of the gig.</i>

11
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,104
<i>It's called cheerleading. You
know, I have to be a leader.</i>

12
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,172
Oh, Marvin.

13
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,506
<i>And diplomatic.</i>

14
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,574
Proactive.

15
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,309
Seriously, hon.

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,011
<i>Come to the realm, boys!</i>

17
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,647
<i>My bitches do not disappoint.</i>

18
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,548
<i>So why do you call
yourselves bitches?</i>

19
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,553
<i>Blackfoot Bloodhounds, yo.</i>

20
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:30,322
<i>Boys be dogs, girls
be bitches. Gangster.</i>

21
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,593
<i>Not now, Leena.</i>

22
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,528
<i>Maddy!</i>

23
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,740
<i>After that, I track
down Terry and, um...</i>

24
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,508
<i>Blue up his balls.</i>

25
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,279
God, Terry charges
my bones. For real.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,682
<i>Next year, he's captain of
the football team and...</i>

27
00:01:55,683 --> 00:02:01,187
<i>I'm captain of the squad, so it's pretty
much gonna be the best year ever.</i>

28
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,289
<i>MMS class.</i>

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,925
<i>I avoid taking honors classes,
so I can maintain all A's.</i>

30
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,994
<i>Overheard that from a senior
bitch, freshmen year.</i>

31
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,230
<i>Take basic classes, show up on time</i>

32
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,665
and always look hot!

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,902
And he's married!

34
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:19,105
<i>Hey, Trace. K-Mads is making me
the star of her little class video.</i>

35
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,474
<i>Please, call me Maddy. Not K-Mads.</i>

36
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,411
<i>Hey! Each day this week, I'm
filming a different student.</i>

37
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,780
<i>Getting school from their
perspective. So...</i>

38
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:29,716
Well, oh! Hi!

39
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,452
<i>Easy to judge everyone else
from behind this thing, huh?</i>

40
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,720
<i>Yeah, can I?</i>

41
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,321
<i>Thank you!</i>

42
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,924
<i>Do you wanna show
me some action now?</i>

43
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,860
<i>Bitch, I thought you
would never ask.</i>

44
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,529
<i>- Where's Hanna?</i>
<i>- Here!</i>

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,730
- Sorry, Lexi, the head got stuck and...
- Put it on.

46
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,089
- Well?
- Magical.

47
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,326
All right, smart ass.

48
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,197
Check this shit out.

49
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,837
Oh, my God!

50
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,472
Get up, Alexis!

51
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,405
Alexis!

52
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,188
Bomb Vik. Get that arm warm, cuz.

53
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,101
Oh, poor Hanna. Still a
prisoner to child lock.

54
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,443
Thank you, Manny.

55
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,685
Hanna!

56
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,224
Seriously?

57
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,659
Not in front of my little sister.

58
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,761
Okay.

59
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,129
Yeah.

60
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,464
Okay.

61
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,669
- Cheetos.
- Goddamn, dude.

62
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,604
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,573
I would've eaten those.

64
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:07,740
Nah, it taste like shit.

65
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,043
Listen up, chiquitas.

66
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,011
I got one spot open.

67
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,314
But, I don't have
to take any of you.

68
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:17,917
I'd rather be one bitch
short, than have a weakling.

69
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,753
When I say your name,
line up in front of me.

70
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,855
And girls...

71
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,191
Don't waste my time.

72
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,928
Corra.

73
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,564
Jen.

74
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,532
Bonnie.

75
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,734
Megan.

76
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,371
Vanessa.

77
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,038
What the f?

78
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,508
Maddy?

79
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,180
Dang, man. Who is that?

80
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,715
Maddy.

81
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,196
Goddamn, somebody gave
that bitch a credit card.

82
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,553
What do you think you're doing?

83
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,755
Uh, there's a spot
open and I want it.

84
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,524
This isn't easy for
us, okay, Maddy?

85
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,794
We put it off as long as possible,
out of respect to Lexi.

86
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,496
God rest her soul.

87
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, well, Alexis
was my friend, too.

88
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:10,136
Did you guys know that we did
gymnastics together, 7th grade?

89
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,504
I guess, she went one way
and I went another and...

90
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:18,745
I don't know, I guess
with everything...

91
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:22,881
Look, I uh, I just know that she was
happier than me and I wanna find out why.

92
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,586
I'm not asking for any favors.

93
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,419
You won't get any.

94
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,104
Keep it up. Let's go, let's go.

95
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,906
Hey, why don't you kiss George.

96
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,874
Come on, take what you
want like a goddamn pro.

97
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,616
Come on!

98
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,888
Ow!

99
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,667
Welcome to the squad, bitch.

100
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,579
<i>Check this shit out.</i>

101
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,156
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

102
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,457
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

103
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,791
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Alexis!</i>

104
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,633
<i>So, uh, here is the new wardrobe.</i>

105
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,771
<i>Ta da!</i>

106
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:28,040
<i>You cannot believe the kind of money
these chicks drop on clothes.</i>

107
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,810
<i>Physical stuff, I can handle.</i>

108
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:35,346
<i>The hard part is going to be, pretending
that I actually like those dumb bitches.</i>

109
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,784
<i>Like that dipshit, Tracy.</i>

110
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,954
<i>Acts like she's all sad</i>

111
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,623
<i>but then, jumps on Terry's jock</i>

112
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,292
<i>before Alexis is
even in the ground.</i>

113
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,459
<i>That's classy.</i>

114
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,063
<i>And Terry...</i>

115
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,200
<i>Mr. big bad wolf himself.</i>

116
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,341
<i>I'm gonna ruin your perfect
little senior year, dog.</i>

117
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,994
Jesus Christ!

118
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,463
Leena, what do you want?

119
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:26,097
Wow, you look, uh...

120
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,167
Uh...

121
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,003
You... you have a lot of makeup on.

122
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,271
- So?
- Can we talk?

123
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,339
No.

124
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,441
Uh, please?

125
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,110
Look, I'm sorry things
got so intense.

126
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,581
And I'm trying to respect that you
want to be alone and everything,

127
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,850
- but, we really need to talk.
- About what?

128
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,018
About you and... and...

129
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,653
Well, Little Madeline here.

130
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,424
Oh, hell no, you did not
name the kitten after me.

131
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,866
- Oh, fuck, Leena.
- I know it's pathetic and...

132
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:03,169
I was lonely and it
doesn't matter, okay?

133
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,872
She was in perfect health when I got
her and then, I gave her your name

134
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,974
and she got sick, just
like that out of nowhere.

135
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,376
And I suppose, you want me to think
it's one of your signs, am I right?

136
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,810
Well, yeah. I mean...

137
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,915
Look at yourself.

138
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,117
You're like a different person.

139
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,918
Something is going on, right?

140
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,025
Can you just listen?

141
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,560
She didn't just get sick, okay?

142
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,262
- She died.
- Leena!

143
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:30,663
It's over.

144
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,497
What's up, bitch?

145
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,636
Sick threads. Make 'em yourself?

146
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,341
Yeah.

147
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,944
Did Mads tell you the
news? It's official.

148
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,946
She's a cheer... leader.

149
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,149
Later.

150
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,283
Blackfoot Bloodhounds, bitches.

151
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,085
Ow!

152
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,886
I'm sorry, sis.

153
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,156
Hey, this really
brings out your face.

154
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,725
- Really?
- You look so beautiful, yeah.

155
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,025
- Really?
- Totally.

156
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,697
You okay?

157
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,969
Do you think Lexi
would be mad at me?

158
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,738
Why?

159
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,539
- 'Cause of me and Terry.
- Oh.

160
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,945
- I'm rotten.
- No, you're not rotten.

161
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:29,780
- Tracy, you're just... You're living.
- Hmm.

162
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,483
Did you like him before?

163
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,389
Uh, before Alexis died, I mean.

164
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,956
I wasn't going to do
anything about it.

165
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:44,128
I mean, Lexi and I always liked the same
things that's why we were best friends.

166
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,000
Mmm.

167
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,303
Well, don't look at me like that.

168
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,139
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- No, I'm...

169
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,874
Damn it, seriously, okay?

170
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,341
Dogs are coming over.

171
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,653
You know the rules.

172
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,122
It's bitches only, tonight. Okay?

173
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,290
So, run along.

174
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:18,062
And Mr. Man. Yeah, don't even
think about calling me tonight.

175
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,034
Martha, my dear?

176
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,908
We would never consider
breaking Blackfoot tradition.

177
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,345
Which is why,

178
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:37,581
we are on our way to break into the
school for our annual pool party.

179
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,286
Dogs, only.

180
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,688
I just came to drop
something off for my gal.

181
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,819
Oh, man, I wanted to
piss in their pool.

182
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,127
Bye, Martha!

183
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,265
We were just talking about you.

184
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,166
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

185
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,338
Here.

186
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,878
I found it. It's broken. But,
it's still kinda cool, right?

187
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,145
Aw! You're so sweet.

188
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,117
It's just a broken clasp,
I can make it work.

189
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,453
Where'd you find it?

190
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,331
Oh, my God!

191
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,166
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

192
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,933
Look!

193
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,168
Look, so sweet!

194
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,972
Yeah, it is.

195
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,408
What's wrong?

196
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,581
I don't know, I...

197
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,216
I feel like I should
tell you something

198
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,952
but, you just seem so happy.

199
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,321
Jesus. Okay, now you
have to tell me.

200
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,528
Okay, will you...

201
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,596
You said that you and
Terry got together

202
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,131
on the last day of school, right?

203
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Yeah, why?

204
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,005
It's just...

205
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,973
I saw him and Cassie
Decker together...

206
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,876
At the lake, fourth
of July weekend.

207
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,479
Cassie Decker?

208
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,388
What's wrong with her? Can't she
just find some college guys.

209
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,490
Tracy, there's only one
person to blame for this.

210
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,192
- I just think that...
- No buts.

211
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,395
He cheated on you. He's an asshole!

212
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,837
- Give it to me, please.
- Well, say it. No!

213
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:39,703
Say it!

214
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,273
Terry's an asshole!

215
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,074
Yeah.

216
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,352
- He's gonna freak.
- Fuck him.

217
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,689
- Tracy, stop!
- No.

218
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,227
It's okay.

219
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,497
Look at you.

220
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,435
- Maddy?
- Hmm?

221
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,841
Is the rumor about you
and Leena Miller true?

222
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,741
What's the rumor?

223
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,777
- You okay?
- Hmm.

224
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,083
Hmm.

225
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,252
Was that weird?

226
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,454
Was what weird?

227
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,699
Oh, wait. Here.

228
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,971
Take my car, pick me up
tomorrow before practice.

229
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,473
No, it's fine, I'm gonna walk.
We're practically neighbors.

230
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,607
- You sure?
- Yeah.

231
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,280
Thanks, Mads.

232
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,549
No problem.

233
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,256
Get some sleep. You wanna look
hot for the rally, tomorrow.

234
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,490
That's right, bitch.

235
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,736
What do you think my chances
are tonight with Martha?

236
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,507
The chances of you striking
out? Pretty goddamn good.

237
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,675
Come on, man. It's rally night.

238
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,845
- Something could happen.
- She even let you smell it?

239
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,450
Hey, guys.

240
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,319
I snagged a couple of bottles of kank
out of my dad's garage last night.

241
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,256
- Shit, you guys smoke?
- Enough to kill a horse, yo.

242
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,124
Do we keep this party
exclusive enough?

243
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,761
Yo, if we ain't hung the fuck
over for the first day tomorrow.

244
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,163
We just ain't dogs. Woof!

245
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,438
Terry?

246
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,673
Hey, man.

247
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,908
You mind not slamming every
single weight down like that?

248
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,011
It's a weight room. Get over it.

249
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,683
Whatever, dude.

250
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,268
So, you really think
I did good tonight?

251
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,803
Are you kidding?
You are a natural, okay?

252
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:15,045
It's a rush, huh? Getting the
whole school fired up like that?

253
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,441
It's real fun.

254
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,648
Need another brew, Manny?

255
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,623
- Oh!
- What's that, it sprayed in my mouth.

256
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,925
Hi.

257
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,059
- How are you doing?
- Good.

258
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,827
I got a...

259
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,494
Ooh!

260
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,104
Don't mention it.

261
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,585
Hey, Tracy. Do you
know where Terry is?

262
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,320
He wasn't at the rally and
he's not answering me.

263
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:05,624
Probably eating dick somewhere.
Wait, what? What's going on?

264
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,727
I'm gonna go get a drink. That's
what's going on. Want one?

265
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,494
Yeah.

266
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,664
So, uh, do you know what's up?

267
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,032
Well, that's between
Terry and Tracy.

268
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,067
You sure?

269
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,271
What do you mean?

270
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:21,572
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

271
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:28,679
But, I'm glad you're hanging
out with us, tonight. It's cool.

272
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,018
What are those?

273
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:40,392
- You'll just make fun of me.
- No, I wouldn't.

274
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,827
These stones put out special energy,
all I'm doing is focusing it.

275
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,398
On what?

276
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,867
- Protecting someone.
- Who?

277
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,540
Oh.

278
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,427
Look, Hanna. I'm kinda
doing my own thing here.

279
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,973
Okay, sorry.

280
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,013
Hanna?

281
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,517
Come on, I'll show you.

282
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,364
Okay.

283
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,634
This is you.

284
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,838
This is somebody close to you.

285
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,478
This is somebody close to them.

286
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,981
Does this sound right to you?

287
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,053
What do I do now?

288
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,856
Uh...

289
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,894
Clear your mind and
focus on what you want.

290
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,033
Anything I want?

291
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:58,735
As long as you're prepared to
deal with the consequences.

292
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,073
Consequences like what?

293
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:11,516
Okay. Say um, the mother
of a soldier makes a wish

294
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,918
that she wants her son
back from the war.

295
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,554
And she gets her wish.

296
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,391
But, her son comes
back in a body bag.

297
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,564
Consequences.

298
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,566
Exactly, so...

299
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,518
- You think I should text Terry?
- No.

300
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,487
It's not like him to bail on a
rally, he lives for this shit.

301
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,490
- Cassie Decker.
- Fucker.

302
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,156
Gee.

303
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,400
Oh, my God!

304
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,412
- Come here.
- What?

305
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,145
Just, come here.

306
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,679
- What?
- Why are you so nice to me?

307
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,010
Uh...

308
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,114
It's kinda new to me.

309
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,984
Is it okay?

310
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,863
- What's wrong?
- Fuck off.

311
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,066
Leena!

312
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,913
Manny! Come here! I need
to talk to you for a second.

313
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,281
Yeah.

314
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:32,048
Threesome, bro.

315
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,288
- She's really, really pissed of...
- What's up, brother?

316
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:38,857
- What's left to drink.
- Uh, we've still got a few beers left.

317
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,927
- Do I look like I want a beer?
- No, man.

318
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:45,463
Oh, there he is, yo. I haven't
seen you in forever, dog. Oh, yo.

319
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,531
Give the man a swig, yo.

320
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,566
Hey, you want some smoke?

321
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,235
- Oh, okay.
- No, no, no. Not you, man.

322
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,372
Give me a smoke.

323
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,207
No, you can't have any, dude.

324
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,642
Goddamn, Manny.

325
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,010
Give me a fucking hit.

326
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,616
You good, man?

327
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:07,252
You want to waste your senior
year chasing a Jesus freak

328
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,521
who's never gonna put out?

329
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,890
That's fine with me, cuz.

330
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,058
What?

331
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,560
But, if that's how it's
going to be, Manchester,

332
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:19,596
your ass is going to be
warming the bench all season.

333
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,772
Mmm. My dogs!

334
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:35,680
I've been thinking. If we're
gonna go all the way, this year.

335
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:40,150
We gotta shake things up. So, I'm
instituting a new team rule.

336
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,157
No fraternizing with cheerleaders.

337
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,193
Effective immediately.

338
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:52,395
It's good enough for the NFL. It's good
enough for Blackfoot fucking high.

339
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,300
Come on, fellas.

340
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,202
Sack up.

341
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,141
You're gonna realize,
I'm doing you a favor.

342
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:07,010
There's a whole world
of pussy out there.

343
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,680
Drama chicks.

344
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,315
- Stoners.
- Mmm.

345
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,917
Goths, smart bitches.

346
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:17,020
Hell, even fat bitches got
their charms, brothers.

347
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:21,591
And tomorrow, first
day of school...

348
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,864
You're eyes are gonna be
open to a fucking gold mine.

349
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,368
Just waiting there.

350
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,570
Freshmen.

351
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:39,177
You ain't gonna remember that cunt's
name when your balls deep in a puppy

352
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,913
that was blowing bubbles in
the eighth grade, last spring.

353
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:45,550
Fucking A, boss. That's
what I'm talking about.

354
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:49,087
- All right, girls, we're leaving.
- Hell, yeah.

355
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,222
Grab me that smoke.

356
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:52,390
You're gonna let him talk to
your bitches like that, Tracy.

357
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,026
This will stop, right
fucking now. Go!

358
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,394
- Go.
- You know...

359
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,829
Tracy.

360
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,665
I'm not gonna say you
have a small dick, Terry.

361
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,168
'Cause that would
just be predictable.

362
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,604
I mean, it's not big,
and that's fine.

363
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,406
But for the sake of the puppies,

364
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,409
I just wanna make sure
you know how to use it.

365
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,879
Three people in my 17
years have made me come.

366
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,815
Myself, of course.

367
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:20,051
This really sweet boy at summer camp
the summer after freshmen year.

368
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,020
Lovely fingers on that boy.

369
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,255
And then, not 10 minutes ago,

370
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:29,059
I got my freaking socks
rocked off by Maddy.

371
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,999
But, never... by you, Terry.

372
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,836
So, you don't wanna hang
with us, this year?

373
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,672
Well, freaking fine with me.

374
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:44,109
No, no, no, no. You
can have the puppies.

375
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,644
We'll find us some college dogs.

376
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,816
- Get her out of here.
- Fuck you.

377
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:56,254
Is a big tough guy like you scared
of a sweet little thing like me.

378
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,456
What do you think, Maddy?

379
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:02,594
Do you think I hurt Mr. Tiny
Peepee's little feelings?

380
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:05,930
Oh, are you gonna cry, Terry?

381
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,298
Huh? Are you gonna cry?

382
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,338
Oh, my goodness! Tracy! Are you okay?

383
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:27,117
You can kiss your precious
football season, goodbye, Terry.

384
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,120
Which one of you is
gonna kick his ass?

385
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,226
You fucking pussies!

386
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,661
He punched Tracy.
He hit a fucking girl.

387
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,165
Manny?

388
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,066
Manny, do something! You asshole!

389
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,268
Do something!

390
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,904
Oh, my God. I'm calling the cops.

391
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:49,040
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Give it back! Give it back!

392
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,609
Hey! Hey, Terry, Terry!

393
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,111
Are you fucking stupid?

394
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:54,412
We should go.

395
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,079
You fuck!

396
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,669
What are you doing?

397
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,493
What the fuck are we doing, huh?

398
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,610
- You gotta stop.
- You worry too much, Vik.

399
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,681
Come on, you're kidding me.

400
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,784
Go!

401
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,823
What the fuck are you doing?

402
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,461
Oh, my God!

403
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,670
Martha, you need to slow down.

404
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,407
Fuck.

405
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,677
There.

406
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,821
Oh!

407
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,138
Come on, come on.
We gotta get them out.

408
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,878
Come on, come on!

409
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,013
We gotta get 'em out.

410
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,781
Oh, God! What are you doing, man?

411
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:39,916
- You can't pull them out.
- We gotta get 'em out.

412
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,221
They're gonna drown.

413
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,225
Let go of me!

414
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,460
Let's get in the car. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

415
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,423
Maddy!

416
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,246
Maddy!

417
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,961
God!

418
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,004
Maddy! Maddy!

419
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,839
Maddy!

420
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,183
Maddy!

421
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,791
No!

422
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,895
Don't die!

423
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,747
Don't die!

424
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,787
Come back to me, please.

425
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,600
Maddy!

426
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,939
Maddy!

427
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,893
What are you doing?

428
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,762
Oh, shit!

429
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,068
What happened last night?

430
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,906
The girls, they're okay?

431
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,110
Jesus!

432
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,916
You don't feel anything about this?

433
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,517
Is it our fault, chicks
can't drive for shit?

434
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,688
Fuck, Tracy.

435
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,157
Oh, crazy fucking dream.

436
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,391
Well, you killed Madeline.

437
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,761
Who's Madeline?

438
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,432
Who's Madeline?

439
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,138
Ugh, what are we doing here?

440
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,711
No way!

441
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,147
Oh, dude, your cheek.

442
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,951
No, other cheek.

443
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:49,320
Ah, don't touch it.

444
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:52,523
Wait, did I break up with Terry?

445
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,657
He punched you in the face.

446
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,263
Oh, no, no, no.

447
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,465
Tracy?

448
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,026
Oh, gross!

449
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,693
Oh, gross!

450
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,368
Martha?

451
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,938
- Martha?
- What?

452
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,674
Uh, she's...

453
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,276
I'm with...

454
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,810
We've kinda...

455
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,688
What is, uh, happening?

456
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,393
Where's my phone? Where's my phone?

457
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:05,474
Hanna, if you could just shut
the fuck up for 2 seconds.

458
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,197
I'm not Hanna.

459
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,634
Think. Gotta wake up. Okay.

460
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,770
I just gotta...

461
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,974
Eat.

462
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,483
Friggin' goat milk.

463
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,310
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

464
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,391
Um, hello?

465
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,227
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

466
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,596
I'm Larry.

467
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,184
God, I'm freaking starving, Larry.

468
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:35,786
- Uh...
- What's for breakfast?

469
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,522
So you told me to focus on
what I wanted, and I did.

470
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:40,090
I couldn't get you to stop
panicking behind the wheel.

471
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,258
It was Manny.

472
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,194
- I remember that and then...
- So, now...

473
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:44,662
Now I can be with Manny.

474
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46,297
And the car was full of water
and everything is upside down.

475
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,766
I mean, I'm sure the stones are
just trying to get us back,

476
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,301
- right?
- I'm trying to get us out, but I can't

477
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:51,869
- Right?
- because of the fucking child locks.

478
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,736
It was my fault.

479
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,443
I crashed us and now,
God is punishing me.

480
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,712
Martha was driving.

481
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,080
- I was.
- She was.

482
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,449
Oh, my God. I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

483
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,951
I'm the only one you could
kill at this point, Maddy.

484
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,355
Because you died last night.

485
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,760
All 4 of you died.

486
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,166
Uh...

487
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,568
Real milk.

488
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:29,039
The bitches think I'm crazy, but,
I drink like half a gallon a day.

489
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,177
I've kept my mouth shut about you
and your mom's crazy wicca bullshit

490
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,746
for as long as I
possibly can, Leena.

491
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:38,949
- What's a wicca?
- No, it's not exactly as wicca.

492
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,759
- Leena's a witch.
- That's not nice, Maddy.

493
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,354
- You shouldn't call people names.
- No, she's right.

494
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,724
- I am a witch.
- At least she thinks she is.

495
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,504
Are you okay?

496
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,248
- I feel good.
- Maybe, maybe...

497
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,552
You should go lay down.

498
00:44:14,553 --> 00:44:17,753
At your own house. I mean, you
should lay down at your own house.

499
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,490
My head's hot.

500
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,729
It is hot.

501
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,400
The rest of you is cold.

502
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,437
And then you start stalking me?

503
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:36,473
When you have no idea
the shit that I'm up to.

504
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:39,043
No idea what I'm going through.
You think everything is about you.

505
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:42,379
That is your problem, Leena. You
think everything I do is about...

506
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,615
What are you doing?

507
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:46,116
You feel mine, right?

508
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,617
Oh, what? Your broken
heart? Give me a break.

509
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,822
What do you feel now?

510
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,361
We can hear the sound
of your heart.

511
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,135
You can...

512
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,503
What?

513
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:08,470
What did you do?

514
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,539
I saved you.

515
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,248
Wait a minute.

516
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,252
Leena!

517
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,090
Leena!

518
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,192
I'm sorry, Larry.

519
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,127
I think, my friends are hungry.

520
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,894
What?

521
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:08,030
Are you kidding me?

522
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,069
This is... This is, uh...

523
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,581
I feel freaking fantastic.

524
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,584
Do you, um...

525
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,188
All feel better?

526
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,090
Stronger?

527
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:13,996
Yes! Oh, my God! Yes!

528
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,266
It worked!

529
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,402
What works, this?

530
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:20,804
My crazy wicca bullshit, it works!

531
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,106
These work.

532
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:24,341
Then why am I in my
sister's body, Leena?

533
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,642
Why would you do that to me?

534
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,377
I don't know, I wasn't
trying to, Martha.

535
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:30,047
You can change us back, right?

536
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:31,281
I don't know.

537
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:34,451
Chop, chop, girls. School's, like, in
a half hour, we totally got to go.

538
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:35,953
Who's driving?

539
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,055
My car broke down last
night, we walked here.

540
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:41,959
Shit! I can't be seen walking
to school on the first day.

541
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,862
Fuck school. Look at what we
just did to Leena's neighbor.

542
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:47,464
Whatever. We can sit
around and sing Kumbaya

543
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:48,999
if it's gonna make you
feel better, but...

544
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,969
- Tracy, shut the fuck up.
- Sure, I'll shut the fuck up

545
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,404
as soon as someone tells me
who's driving me to school.

546
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,039
Uh, what about his car?

547
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,859
You weren't wrong about the hot
young tail up in this bitch, huh?

548
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,339
Ladies...

549
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,275
Let me the first to welcome
you to Blackfoot High.

550
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,512
I'm Terry.

551
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:38,816
- We know who you are.
- Yeah, we do.

552
00:48:38,817 --> 00:48:42,686
This here is the star
quarterback, Mr. Vik De Palma.

553
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:46,190
Go ahead. Feel the arm,
girls. Don't be shy.

554
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:48,192
There's more than
enough to go around.

555
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:49,958
It's so hard.

556
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,131
Can you give some
love to my boy, Manny

557
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,434
And Ben.

558
00:48:58,535 --> 00:48:59,603
Hi, guys!

559
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:00,671
Hey.

560
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:02,272
Give them some love.

561
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,808
My dogs bleed on the field
every day for this school.

562
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:06,508
Wow.

563
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,625
- Do you have Facebook?
- So, how's the...

564
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,383
Fuck!

565
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,317
I like your shirt.

566
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,453
So, let's talk soon.

567
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,292
Hi, Vik!

568
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:26,995
Are you okay?

569
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,798
No.

570
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,236
Can I talk to you for a second?

571
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:36,740
Yeah, of course. Come on.

572
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:38,308
Clear the road, puppies.

573
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,244
Bloodhound bitches
in the house, ya'll.

574
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,557
Vik?

575
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,968
Look at her in that suit,
she looks like such a slut.

576
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:12,102
Mmm-hmm.

577
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:14,369
Psst! Yo, bitch!

578
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,160
Cell phones off, people.

579
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,895
What are the odds, Ben.
We're table mates.

580
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,601
It sounded like...

581
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,002
You're speaking my language.

582
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,640
You guys are okay?

583
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,811
Sure.

584
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:58,125
We tried to help you guys,
we just... We... You know,

585
00:51:58,126 --> 00:52:01,117
- we couldn't get down there...
- Hey, hey, hey.

586
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,518
No harm, no foul, right?

587
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,124
Get me high after class,
we'll call it even.

588
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,939
Oh, shave my ball sack.

589
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,641
- Leena. Leena Miller.
- Who?

590
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,510
Leena Miller. I'm not
fucking with you, dude.

591
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,745
She was making these little
stones float in the air.

592
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,415
- It was fucking magic, dude.
- Oh, it's fucking magic, dude.

593
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:34,549
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you.

594
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,187
What's up, Terry?

595
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:21,063
Wow, Hanna. Didn't
know you had tits.

596
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,732
If she's a dog.

597
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:26,001
She must have 6 more
hidden somewhere, dude.

598
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,811
So, there's two things you
gotta know about George's van.

599
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:40,016
1, there's always a weed stash.

600
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:43,318
And 2, it's never locked.

601
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,292
And 3, it smells like dick.

602
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,474
Hi, guys! Terry, how's your hand?

603
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,279
Punched his girlfriend in the
face. I mean, you know.

604
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,481
That shit can hurt the puncher
as much as the punchee, so...

605
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,219
Maddy and I had a little
fling over the summer.

606
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,189
I guess she's still
a bit sore from it.

607
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:28,563
All right, we're gonna go.
We'll see you guys later.

608
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:33,235
Remember the buddy system, girls.

609
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,310
There's only one outcome when
people play games with me, Maddy.

610
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:45,981
- They lose.
- Playtime's over, Terry.

611
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,518
What happened last night?

612
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,656
You know, before last night,

613
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,958
I was just gonna ruin
your senior year.

614
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:58,693
But now... I'm gonna
have to kill you.

615
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,096
Just watch your mouth, dyke.

616
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,565
Oh!

617
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,502
Oh!

618
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,238
Ah!

619
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,242
Ah!

620
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:20,215
Ah!

621
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,617
Let's go, man.

622
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,086
Let's go!

623
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,374
Uh, what the fuck is going on?

624
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:47,876
Somebody got fucked, somebody
got killed and I'm going to PE.

625
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,450
Come on.

626
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:01,656
Martha! I'm so, so
happy you're okay.

627
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:06,561
I was drunk and I was stoned,
I didn't know what to...

628
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,326
For real?

629
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,674
- Right.
- Mmm-hmm.

630
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,346
Whoa!

631
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,816
Wow!

632
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,555
Oh, my goodness.

633
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:10,894
What?

634
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:11,961
Jesus Christ, Martha.

635
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:13,496
Shit, I didn't mean
to say his name.

636
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:15,699
I know you hate that.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

637
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,866
Did I do it again?

638
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:18,401
Oh, Jesus Christ.

639
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:20,201
Wanna see something?

640
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,105
Yeah.

641
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,873
You sure you want our
first time to be here?

642
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,675
- In the handicap bathroom?
- Mmm-hmm

643
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:27,777
- Yeah.
- I love you, Martha.

644
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,780
- I want you to call me Hanna.
- What?

645
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,714
Check this out.

646
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,420
Oh, shit!

647
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,690
Tracy, that...

648
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:43,491
Fucking disgusting.

649
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,429
Please, just call me Hanna.

650
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,432
Okay. Hanna.

651
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,001
Okay.

652
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,302
- Okay.
- Oh, I love you Hanna!

653
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,242
Oh.

654
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:02,677
Uh, are you okay?

655
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,347
- Yeah!
- Oh, it's cold.

656
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,182
Ugh!

657
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,984
It's cold.

658
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,991
Oh, it's cold.

659
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,152
Oh, help me, Jesus.

660
00:58:42,153 --> 00:58:43,453
Oh, help me, Jesus.

661
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,862
- There you go.
- Yeah, you can do it. It's nice.

662
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:29,130
- So, how are you feeling? It's all right.
- Feeling good?

663
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,367
Oh, shit.

664
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,356
Uh, what the fuck is going on?

665
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:57,125
Somebody got fucked, somebody
got killed and I'm going to PE.

666
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,996
We should never have
come to school.

667
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:02,265
Hey, bitches!

668
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,033
- Who was it?
- What do you mean?

669
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,472
Ben.

670
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:13,009
At least it's not more
innocent blood on our hands.

671
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,243
No more feeding at school.

672
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,755
Don't do that.

673
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,566
Anyone else seen this?

674
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,635
No.

675
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:43,271
Let's keep it that way.

676
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,850
- Sorry, Nicholas.
- Asshole!

677
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,997
I've been waiting for
this for so long.

678
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,644
- Vik. Dude, it happened.
- What's up?

679
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:25,014
- What happened?
- Dude, me, Martha, the handicap bathroom.

680
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:28,685
Dude, I was all up in that
sweet, sweet freezer.

681
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,320
What freezer? What are
you talking about?

682
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,954
- Hey, I didn't even know.
- Know what?

683
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,593
That it's cold in there.

684
01:01:36,594 --> 01:01:38,594
Uh... I don't even...

685
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,622
It's supposed to be
cold in there, right?

686
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,667
Manny...

687
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,070
Oh, hey, Hanna.

688
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,272
Come with me.

689
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,608
No, I got trig. I gotta go.

690
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:53,969
But, Martha asked me
to bring you to her.

691
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,646
- Where is she?
- The sticks.

692
01:01:56,647 --> 01:01:59,875
- Said she wanted to see you in private.
- Really?

693
01:01:59,876 --> 01:02:02,218
But I'll just tell her
you've got trigonometry.

694
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,485
What? No. Are you serious?

695
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,318
Uh.

696
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,422
Martha?

697
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,089
How could you do it?

698
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:46,060
How could you have sex...

699
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,063
With my sister.

700
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,200
She's my girlfriend.

701
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:53,069
No, I'm your girlfriend.

702
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,288
Um, I can't miss class for
whatever this is, Hanna,

703
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:59,841
- so why don't you...
- No, you stop right there, Mr. Man.

704
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,180
Hanna, you're a...

705
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:10,520
You're a sweet kid. But, you don't
need to be like your sister.

706
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:14,455
I love her, but everybody hates it

707
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:19,627
when she pulls that
prissy, bossy bullshit.

708
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,552
Ahhh!

709
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,572
Close your eyes.

710
01:04:46,783 --> 01:04:48,050
Fuck!

711
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,019
Shit, Maddy, my stones are gone.

712
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,021
Somebody stole them.
Do you think it was Terry?

713
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,956
Well, who else?

714
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:00,630
- You okay?
- No. I'm sluggish.

715
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:04,332
- And that sucks.
- It's okay, you just need blood.

716
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,100
Leena.

717
01:05:07,805 --> 01:05:09,871
Here, drink from me.

718
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,684
Come on. Let's find the
others and get out of here.

719
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:56,285
- Practice time, bitches.
- What?

720
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,955
We're not slacking on my
watch, big game Friday night.

721
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:00,656
Okay, did you feed again?

722
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:02,992
No, you said not to.
I'm a team player.

723
01:06:02,993 --> 01:06:04,861
Somebody did and...

724
01:06:04,862 --> 01:06:07,530
- Terry stole my stones.
- Okay, enough already.

725
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,031
Bitches and I got work to do.

726
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:10,965
Come on, Mads.

727
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,839
- You've seen Vik?
- No.

728
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,276
- What about Manny?
- No, not since lunch.

729
01:06:20,277 --> 01:06:23,646
- You thinking what I'm thinking, boss?
- What are you thinking, Shank?

730
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:26,781
That voodoo dyke and her bitches
are picking us dogs off.

731
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,718
One by one.

732
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:31,786
Bitches glowing like Lite-Brites
and shit. You saw it.

733
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,789
Look, I've been thinking a lot.

734
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,993
- About borrowing your sister's clothes?
- Don't be an asshole, Vik.

735
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:38,561
- No, fuck you guys.
- You're being a pussy.

736
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:39,662
- Find yourself a new quarterback.
- You're being a pussy.

737
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,462
- Fuck you.
- Pussy.

738
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,204
You think I'm gonna let you quit?

739
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,853
Hey, Dad. Me and the
bitches, the girls,

740
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:07,323
um, we are going to be staying
at Maddy's house tonight,

741
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:10,092
because we have a
whole lot of cheers

742
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:12,228
that we have to go over and
practice and everything.

743
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:15,631
So, I guess we'll be
seeing you tomorrow.

744
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:20,201
Uh, don't work too hard. We
love you. Okay, bye, Dad. Bye.

745
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:26,774
So, I just have to do
this all the time now.

746
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,479
- Where did you get that?
- None of your beeswax.

747
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,681
Can I use it a minute?

748
01:07:31,682 --> 01:07:33,149
I'm just gonna keep
killing innocent people.

749
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:36,118
Am I the only one that
gives a shit about that.

750
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:36,770
Come on, Martha,

751
01:07:36,771 --> 01:07:38,321
- I need to check Facebook.
- No.

752
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:40,790
You don't have to kill,
we can do it this way.

753
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,124
- Martha!
- Leave me alone!

754
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,726
Martha, chill!

755
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:45,128
Tracy, you can use my computer.

756
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:48,798
Hanna, Leena, look after these
bitches. I gotta go take a shower.

757
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:51,801
We're family now. Like it
or not, families fight.

758
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:54,403
Yeah, well, I don't really
need a family, so...

759
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,604
Well, what if we need you, Maddy?

760
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:03,477
Goddamn, boss.

761
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,180
Taking it to the next level.

762
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:12,954
Let's get Vik.

763
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:56,065
Why do you have Manny's phone?

764
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:57,733
Because Manny was a jerk.

765
01:08:57,734 --> 01:08:59,902
You should see what these
texts say about me.

766
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:03,104
Okay, what do you
mean he was a jerk?

767
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:08,075
What do you think I mean?

768
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,715
You shouldn't have
done that, Martha.

769
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:15,251
Shut up, Leena. You
don't even know me.

770
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:16,752
Oh!

771
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:18,921
Hanna, no. Wait. You need
blood, you're weak right now.

772
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:20,823
Okay, Hanna is a little weakling.

773
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:24,024
- No, I wasn't saying that.
- Fuck off, witch.

774
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,796
God!

775
01:09:26,797 --> 01:09:30,297
Sorry, Leena. I just
need to be alone, okay?

776
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,334
- I have to go.
- Hanna!

777
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:35,469
Bonus, K-Mads keeps a video diary.

778
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:48,284
Vik's gone, his bike's gone.

779
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:50,519
I told you he'd queef and run.

780
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,555
<i>The hard part is going to be, pretending
that I actually like those dumb bitches.</i>

781
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:59,261
<i>Like that dipshit, Tracy.</i>

782
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:02,264
<i>Acts like she's all sad but
then, jumps on Terry's jock</i>

783
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:06,133
<i>before Alexis is even in
the ground. That's classy.</i>

784
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,303
<i>And Terry.</i>

785
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:13,476
<i>Mr. big bad wolf himself.</i>

786
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:18,247
<i>I'm gonna ruin your perfect
little senior year, dog.</i>

787
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:22,084
<i>But, right now. I have to go and
paint my face up like those whores.</i>

788
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:25,019
<i>So, uh... Maddy Killian, out!</i>

789
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,527
Tracy.

790
01:10:31,528 --> 01:10:35,663
Tracy, that was like a week
ago. I didn't know you then.

791
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,369
I'm taking Larry's car.

792
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,637
No, we have to stay together.

793
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,839
I'm not asking.

794
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:47,143
Give me a ride.

795
01:10:47,144 --> 01:10:50,679
You don't let me borrow your phone but,
you expect me to give your ass a ride?

796
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,816
- No, no. You have to listen.
- Cassie Decker.

797
01:10:53,817 --> 01:10:55,950
Is that true?

798
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:01,822
- Wait.
- No!

799
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:08,335
I thought you were being nice
to me because you liked me.

800
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,504
This is all your fault.

801
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:18,205
Tracy, wait. You can use my phone.

802
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,218
What did he do to you?

803
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,420
Tracy!

804
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,255
Tracy!

805
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,757
After Lexi died...

806
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:41,128
I felt like I needed to do
something nice for her.

807
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,901
So, I started to make
her a tribute video.

808
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:49,003
I wanted to interview
all of her friends.

809
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:53,007
Terry always seemed
kind of pompous, but...

810
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,712
All of a sudden, he was
just a regular guy.

811
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:02,351
<i>I felt sorry for him.</i>

812
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:06,053
That's why I didn't think twice
about going to his place to talk.

813
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,458
Martha?

814
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,737
Just kinda laughed it off at first.

815
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,073
I said no thanks.

816
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,810
Then his eyes changed.

817
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,014
How could someone like me

818
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:36,851
turn him down.

819
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,026
Grab her! Grab her! The other side!

820
01:12:44,995 --> 01:12:47,194
Punched me in the stomach.

821
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:49,897
And then he...

822
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,810
I think you need to say it.

823
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,751
He raped me.

824
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,167
Hanna!

825
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,090
She's got me, boss. She's got me.

826
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,193
You killed Hanna!

827
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:52,421
- Just forget about them.
- Leena, they're our friends.

828
01:14:52,422 --> 01:14:54,022
Martha! Tracy!

829
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:57,057
You need blood, you're not
strong enough for this.

830
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,431
- Maddy, are you okay?
- What did you guys do?

831
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:04,266
What are you talking about?

832
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:06,535
I didn't do anything. I'm not
with Terry, I came here for you.

833
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:08,902
I don't need you to rescue me, Vik.

834
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,147
Maddy! No, no!

835
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,421
Let her go.

836
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,125
Whoo!

837
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,527
I can't move.

838
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:37,297
I never understood why you
had the hots for her, Viky.

839
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,267
Till I fucked her, this summer.

840
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:42,903
She puts up a good fight.

841
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,141
Who are you, man?

842
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:48,342
I'm your best friend, bud.

843
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,512
I broke her in for
you and everything.

844
01:15:50,513 --> 01:15:52,212
Vik?

845
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,816
Hey, Vik, I need your help.

846
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,352
Yeah.

847
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:11,233
Oh, you are such a
little bitch, Vik.

848
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,367
I owe it to you, too, cuz.

849
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:18,105
You want her? Come and get her.

850
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,109
You girls got your seatbelts on?

851
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,845
Oh!

852
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,014
Whoa!

853
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,888
Tastes like jellybeans.

854
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:15,223
I'm like the Cookie
Monster up in this bitch.

855
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:18,091
Oh, I hope that shit
was gluten free.

856
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,334
Come on, bitches.

857
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:28,971
- Terry!
- Maddy!

858
01:18:28,972 --> 01:18:31,506
<i>I don't know but I've been told</i>

859
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:34,476
<i>Killing pussies, going home</i>

860
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:38,545
Mad, we have to do this together!

861
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,815
Whoa!

862
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,749
Maddy! Maddy!

863
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,584
Maddy!

864
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,865
No!

865
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,105
Oh, my God!

866
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:04,938
Terry!

867
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,622
No, no, no, no.

868
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:23,790
Maddy!

869
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:33,433
Come on, Leena. We gotta talk.

870
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:41,275
You're gonna tell me
how to use these.

871
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,915
She just died, didn't she?

872
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,483
Again.

873
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:51,785
Trap must've ripped that
stone right out of her.

874
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,989
And you feel it.

875
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,656
Is that it?

876
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,992
But I feel fucking great.

877
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,296
Why is that?

878
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:02,898
Because you're an interloper.

879
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:05,565
- Like a free agent?
- More like a leech.

880
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,911
I'm so sorry.

881
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:25,152
What can I do with these?

882
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,854
You wanna show me?

883
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,825
Or...

884
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:34,629
I can see what happens...

885
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,364
When I carve that one
out of your throat.

886
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,100
No.

887
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:46,773
- It's your call.
- No, you...

888
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,678
Holy shit!

889
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:58,085
I've never done that before.

890
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,066
Ah!

891
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:14,870
This is a new and improved Terry.

892
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:19,007
Oh, it's gonna be a hell
of a season thanks to you.

893
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:22,843
You know, I never did get
a straight answer on that.

894
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,013
Girlfriend?

895
01:21:25,014 --> 01:21:27,180
Ex-girlfriend?

896
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:32,886
Girlfriend, bitch!

897
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,165
No!

898
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,667
No!

899
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,972
No!

900
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,650
Ah, no!

901
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:51,331
Maddy!

902
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,500
No, no!

903
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,939
No! No!

904
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:02,010
No! You're not leaving me.

905
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:04,512
I won't let you go.

906
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,003
Crazy wicca bullshit.

907
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,730
Leena!

908
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,834
Oh, shit!
