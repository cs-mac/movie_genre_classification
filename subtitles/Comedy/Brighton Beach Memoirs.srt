1
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:07,536
 Good morning, glory

00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:09,734
 Say there,
stop that yawning 

3
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,142
 A brand-new day
is dawning 

4
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:14,646
 Pull up the shade,
and let the sun come through 

5
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:16,614
 Good morning, glory 

6
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:18,116
 Spend about an hour 

7
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:20,676
 Underneath the shower 

8
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:23,120
 And keep on singin'
like the birdies do 

9
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,021
 Ho-hum, ho-hum 

10
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,286
 While you're waiting
for your toast 

11
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,555
 Call the one
you love the most 

12
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:32,029
 Pick up the phone
and start in saying 

13
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:33,793
 Good morning, glory 

14
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,028
 Were you
dreaming of me 

15
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:38,832
 And do you
still love me 

16
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:40,805
 Well, baby,
here's a kiss for you 

17
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,671
 Good morning, glory 

18

 Good morning, glory

 Well, baby,

37
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,649
Elbows up.

00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,880
And 2...

00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:33,585
<i>And plie...</i>

3...

44
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,390
open, and...

45
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:54,373
The crowd is hushed
at Yankee Stadium...

46
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,375
The House
that Ruth Built...

47
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:58,377
As the early autumn shadows...

48
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:01,380
cast itself
over the right field fence.

49
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:04,383
The flags flap wildly
in the breeze.

50
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,148
As we move into
the top of the seventh inning,

51
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:11,122
with one strike
on JoJo Moore,

52
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,624
Red Ruffing pitches.

53
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:17,195
I thought
it was a gunshot.

54
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:19,891
Yeah, I'll give
him a gunshot.

55
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,059
One out,
a man on second,

56
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:26,071
top of the seventh,
two strikes on JoJo Moore.

57
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,572
What did I tell you about
banging the ball?

58
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,006
Aunt Blanche
has a headache.

59
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:32,567
I can't stop. It's a crucial moment
in World Series history.

60
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:35,080
The Yanks are
playing the Giants.

61
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,173
<i>I'm not gonna tell you again!
Do you hear me?</i>

62
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,276
I don't want him
to stop playing.

63
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:41,786
It's just the banging.

64
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:44,653
He always does it
when I'm studying.

65
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:46,248
One more pitch.
I can get him to pop up.

66
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,055
I've got my stuff today.

67
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,494
Your father will
give you his stuff
when he gets home.

68
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:53,691
Get in here and put out
the water glasses! Now!

69
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:57,202
I'll put out
the glasses.

70
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,204
Why, is
his arm broken?

71
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:02,070
I've told him
109 times about
making noises.

72
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:03,234
[Bang]

73
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,444
Don't yell
on my account.

74
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:10,278
I'm through.

75
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,477
<i>I got him out.
I knew I had my stuff.</i>

76
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:13,951
Wash your hands.

77
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,715
They're clean.
I'm wearing a glove.

78
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,723
Don't talk
back to me!

79
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:24,029
I wasn't talking back,
I was answering.

80
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:25,530
Who asked you
anything?

81
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,964
And don't answer
under your breath
when I walk away.

82
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:28,762
Oh, sh...

83
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:30,234
What?

84
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:31,861
I hear you!

85
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,372
If they cut
my ears off,

86
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:37,376
I would still hear her
through my nose.

87
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,627
That's enough sewing
for today.

88
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,536
All I need is
for you to go blind.

89
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,700
[Cough]

90
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,176
Is your throat
sore again?

91
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:15,339
No. It's
the same one
from before.

92
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:18,407
What are you
doing in there,
Eugene?

93
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:22,285
<i>"What... are... you...</i>

94
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:25,324

<i>"Eugene?</i>

96

She bellowed
in her loud voice."

97
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:33,966
<i>Eugene!</i>

98
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:36,568

<i>I'm coming!</i>

100
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,406
I'm coming.

101
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,310
I hate my name.

102
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,974
Eugene Morris Jerome.

103
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,813
How will I ever play
for the Yankees...

104
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,786
with a name like that?

105
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:58,312
<i>- [Boys Chattering]
- Yeah! Hey, catch the ball!</i>

106
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:02,225
<i>[Eugene Narrating]
You have to beJoe, Tony, or Frankie.</i>

107
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,729
All the best Yankees
are Italian.

108
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:07,232
My mother makes spaghetti
with ketchup.

109
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,632
What chance do I have?

110
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,839
[Sighs]

111
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,340
Actually...

112
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:18,343
I think I'm going
to be a writer.

113
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:22,472
I want to write books
or plays or movies.

114

<i>[Narrating] That is, if things don't
work out with the Yanks.</i>

Yeah.

116
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,428
I'll definitely
be a writer.

117

Hello! Eugene!

120
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,103
Oh, hello,
Mrs. Laski.

121
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:55,780
I thought you promised...

122
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,784
to help me
clean out my basement.

123
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,547
Oh, I am, I am.

124
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,178
Not for nothing.

125
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:03,950
I'll give you something.

126
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,924
[Thinking] Is she thinking
what I'm thinking?

127
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:22,237
You have better color today,
sweetheart.

128
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,105
Did you get a little sun?

129
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:25,906
I walked down
to the beach.

130
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,412
Very slowly,
I hope.

131
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,913
Yes, Ma.

132
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:32,509
She always does
what she's told,
that one.

133
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,449
Eugene!

134
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,680
<i>Pick up
those magazines.</i>

135
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,028
[Narrating]
She gets special treatment...

136
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:47,533
because the doctors say
she has a flutter in her heart.

137
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,535
So I have to do
all her work.

138
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:53,037
<i>She'd better have
a bad heart,</i>

139
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:56,564
<i>or I'm going
to kill her one day.</i>

140
00:09:58,578 --> 00:09:59,840
What's this?

141
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:01,847
Isn't it
a roller skate?

142
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,348
On the
kitchen floor?

143
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,350
I didn't
leave it there.

144
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:08,353
No? Who skates
in the kitchen,
Laurie? Blanche?

145
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,446
How many times
have I told you...

146
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,423
not to leave your things
around the house?

147
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:13,424
109.

148
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:14,755
What?

149
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:16,260
<i>You said yesterday,</i>

150
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:19,765
<i>"I told you 109 times, not to leave

151
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:21,265
Don't be fresh, Eugene.

152
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:24,269
Go upstairs. Put it
in the closet.

153
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:31,066
[Thinking] I'm putting all this down
in my memoirs...

154
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:34,011
so if I grow up
twisted and warped,

155
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,877
the world will know why.

156
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,584

159
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:47,191
I've got the most
incredible news.

160
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,524
I'll tell you tomorrow!

161
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:57,135
What's this?

162
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:58,636
My hockey puck.

163
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:00,138
On the kitchen floor.

164
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,639
I almost
killed myself.

165
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,141
Suppose father came home,

166
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,144
and I was dead
on the kitchen floor?

167
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,180
I'd say, "Don't go
in the kitchen, Pa."

168
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:09,646
Ooh!

169
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:11,650
Hey, shoes on the bed.

170
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:14,653
That's bad luck
in a Jewish house.

171
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,155
It's notJewish.
Italians built it.

172
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,157
You're looking
to get it.

173
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:22,160
I need Swiss cheese.
Go to Greenblatt's.

174
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,320
Now?

175
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,830
No. Next year
when I'm dead.

176
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:27,729
Tell him
four thin slices.

177
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,732
You hear?

178
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:29,927
Very thin!

179
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:32,062
The kind
you see through.

180
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:35,574
Don't forget the deposit
on the empty milk bottle.

181
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,575
Don't climb
so fast, sweetheart.

182
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:39,076
You'll get overheated.

183
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:44,349
Sid Luckman of Columbia
awaits the snap from center.

184
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,352
The snow falls
in a near blizzard.

185
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,853
He fades back.

186
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,582
He passes...

187
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:53,324
and Luckman's got it!

188
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,520
Luckman catches
his own pass!

189
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:00,498
Hey, watch it!

190
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,295
<i>He's on the 50...
[Car Horn Honking]</i>

191
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:03,460
The 40...

192
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:04,628
<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

193
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:06,228
The 35...

194
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:07,738
the 30...

195
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,603
the 25...

196
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,301
Oh, my God!

197
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,106
Sorry, Eugene.

198
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,238
My mother
will kill me.

199
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,747
It wasn't
your fault.

200
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,250
She'll charge me
for dessert tonight.

201
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,616
How much is the deposit?
Three cents.

202
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:22,984
Here. Here.

203
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:24,683
Here's a dime.

204
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:25,951
A dime?

205
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,822
That was
a great run.

206
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:30,294
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Murphy.

207
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,290
<i>Oh, uh...</i>

208
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:34,390
say hello
to your Aunt Blanche
for me, huh?

209
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,332
I will.

210
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:40,731
He'll do anything to get in good
with Aunt Blanche.

211
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:42,968
That's why I purposely
dropped the bottle.

212
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,979
What am I gonna do
about him, Blanche?

213
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:50,982
I found lima beans
in his closet.

214
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,484
They would've grown
into a tree.

215
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:55,487
He'll grow
out of it.

216
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,988
Think Nora's
any better,

217
00:12:57,056 --> 00:13:00,685
the way she leaves
her clothes around?

218
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,250
Girls are different.

219
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:05,195
The day Mama left
the house in Russia,

220
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:07,698
she cleaned
from top to bottom.

221
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:11,203
She said, when the Cossacks
broke into her house,

222
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,932
[Together] "They would have respect
for theJews."

223
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:16,372
Who were the Cossacks?

224
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,675
The same filthy bunch that
lives across the street.

225
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:22,680
You mean the Murphys?

226
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:24,511
All of them.

227
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:28,619
The mother is nice.

228
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:31,987
She's been
very sweet to me.

229
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:33,992
Her windows
are so filthy,

230
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,221
I thought
she had black curtains.

231
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:39,958
I think Frank Murphy's
sweet on Mom.

232
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:43,365
<i>You mean that
drunken son ofhers?</i>

233
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,700
Kate, stop it.

234
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,739
Listen, he knows
your situation.

235
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,537
<i>I know their kind.</i>

236
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,170
Remember what
Mama used to say.

237
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:56,181
<i>"Stay on your own side
of the street.</i>

238
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,183
That's what they have gutters for."

239
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,556
Is that thin enough?

240
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,151
A little thinner.

241
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,492
Ma likes it
when it floats.

242
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,601
That's better.

243
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:41,755
Who died?

244
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,089
Mr. Nunzio.

245
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,424
The shoemaker?

246
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:45,930
Wow, what happened?

247
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,193
He had [Whispers] cancer.

248
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,704
Why do old people
always whisper...

249
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:55,206
what someone dies from?

250
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,265
Like my Uncle Dave,
Aunt Blanche's husband.

251
00:14:57,343 --> 00:15:00,210
He died from a
[Whispers] coronary.

252
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,213
People from the old country...

253
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:04,272
think it's bad luck
to say a disease out loud.

254
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,580
Like if God hears you,
he'll give it to you.

255
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,712
My grandfather died from
[Whispers] diphtheria.

256
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,848
Anyway, after Uncle Dave died,

257
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:15,325
he left Aunt Blanche with no money...
not even insurance.

258
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:18,830
She couldn't support herself
because she has [Whispers] asthma.

259
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:21,765
<i>[Eugene Narrating] Mother
took her in with her two daughters.</i>

260
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:24,766
<i>My father had to take
anotherjob...</i>

261
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,270
<i>to support us all.</i>

262
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,772
<i>Besides cutting raincoats,</i>

263
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,274
<i>he sells party favors
to nightclubs.</i>

264
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:33,278
<i>I think it's getting to him
because I heard Mom say...</i>

265
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:38,181
<i>Pop was developing
[Whispers] high blood pressure.</i>

266
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:40,777
Eugene!

267
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:43,344
Eugene!

268
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,356
My sweet, adorable,
handsome cousin.

269
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:49,793
Wait till you hear
what's happened to me!

270
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:51,887
You won't believe
this, Mama.

271
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:53,898
You just
won't believe it.

272
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,935
<i>[Laurie] Well, tell us already.
The suspense is killing me.</i>

273
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:59,130
Don't say things
like that.

274
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,696
What is it, Nora?
What happened?

275
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,174
Shh!

276
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:05,267
<i>[Laurie] She takes so long.</i>

277
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:08,779
I'm going to be
in a Broadway show.

278
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:13,785
<i>It's a musical called
Abracadabra.</i>

279
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,878
This man, Mr. Beckman...

280
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,388
He's a producer...

281
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:20,391
Came into our dancing class
this afternoon,

282
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,893
and he picked out
three girls.

283
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,897
<i>We start rehearsing
a week from Monday.</i>

284
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:27,899
<i>Then it goes
to Philadelphia,</i>

285
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,229
<i>Wilmington, Washington.</i>

286
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,930
Then it comes
to New York...

287
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,938
the second week
in December.

288
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:36,440
There are nine
big musical numbers.

289
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:39,103
There's going to be
a glass tank...

290
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,440
you can see through,

291
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:43,573
and the big finale
all takes place...

292
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,550
with the entire cast
all underwater.

293
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,220
<i>I mean,
can you believe it?</i>

294
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:56,625
I'm going to be in
a Broadway show, Mama!

295
00:16:58,264 --> 00:16:59,697
What's she
talking about?

296
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:01,198
Do I know?

297
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:02,700
Am I her mother?

298
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:06,204
How can you be in a show?
Don't you have to sing and act?

299
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:07,534
I can sing.

300
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:08,595
No, you can't.

301
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:09,606
A little.

302
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:10,539
No, you can't.

303
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,668
I can carry a tune.

304
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,939
No, you can't.

305
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:15,571
I probably won't have to.

306
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:16,945
They're just
looking for dancers.

307
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:21,715
<i>[Blanche] Did you tell him
how old you were?</i>

308
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,345
He didn't ask me.

309
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:26,357
<i>He didn't ask
if you were 16?</i>

310
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:29,053
He just asked me
to audition.

311
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:32,564
<i>My God, isn't
anybody excited?</i>

312
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:36,362
I am. It's the most
fantastic thing I ever heard.

313
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,868
Thanks, Eugene.

314
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:40,132
I'm glad
somebody's
excited.

315
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,640
How can you
go to Philadelphia?

316
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,141
What about school?

317
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,643
It's
a Broadway show.

318
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,145
It's what
I want to do.

319
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:51,149
Algebra and English
isn't going to help me
on the stage.

320
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,309
<i>[Laurie] Aren't.</i>

321
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,319
You stay out of this!

322
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:57,322
<i>[Blanche] Forget about school.
Do you know how hard it is...</i>

323
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,325
for a girl
to get a good job...

324
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:02,327
without
a high school diploma?

325
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:03,726
Tell her, Kate.

326
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,957
It's very hard.

327
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,767
Then I'm asking
something else.

328
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,235
Let me do something
for you now.

329
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:16,764
I could be making
almost $60 a week,
maybe more.

330
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:19,276
I wouldn't make
that much today...

331
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:20,778
with
a college diploma.

332
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:23,815
[Narrating] It was a tense moment
for everybody.

333
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:25,350
I love tense moments,

334
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:29,320
especially when I'm not
the one they're tense about.

335
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,524
UncleJack
will be home soon.

336
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:35,526
We'll discuss it
at dinner.

337
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:44,669
Can you believe it?
16 years old.

338
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:47,672
I have to call
Mr. Beckman now...

339
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,674
about the audition
on Monday.

340
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:52,176
Please don't say no
until Monday.

341
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:55,179
We'll leave it
up to UncleJack.

342
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:57,977
We'll let him
make the decision.

343
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,313
Why, Mama?

344
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:03,321
I love him,
but he's not my father.

345
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:04,822
Because I need help.

346
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,328
I don't always know
what the right thing
to do is.

347
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:11,488
Because...

348
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:12,997
I say so!

349
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:14,327
That's why.

350
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,573
You have nothing
better to do?

351
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,074
I need bread.

352
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:25,576
What?

353
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:29,080
Run over to Greenblatt's
and get fresh rye bread.

354
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:35,119
I just came back
from Greenblatt's.

355
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,620
So you'll go again.

356
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,759
I'm always going
to the store!

357
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,762
When I grow up,
that's all I'll know.

358
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,263
Never mind. I'll go.

359
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:47,765
Don't do that.

360
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,767
Don't make me
feel guilty.

361
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:52,599
And get a quarter
pound of butter.

362
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,765
I bought a quarter pound
this morning.

363
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,832
You should buy
half pounds.

364
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,902
Suppose the house
burned down this afternoon.

365
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,006
Why do I need
an extra quarter pound
of butter?

366
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,779
If mother taught logic
in high school,

367
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:09,218
this would be
some weird country.

368
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,300
[Thinking] If I had my choice...

369
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,802
between a tryout
with the Yankees...

370
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,304
and actually seeing
Nora's bare breasts...

371
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:28,806
for 21/2 seconds,

372
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:31,536
I would have some
serious thinking to do.

373
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,305
<i>[Man] Hey, Eugene.</i>

374
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,313
Did Pop get home yet?

375
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:37,815
No. You look terrible.

376
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,316
What's wrong?

377
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,818
I'm in trouble,

378
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:42,319
really big trouble.

379
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:43,821
What kind of trouble?

380
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,153
Not here.
Pop could pass by.

381
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:47,658
Down at the beach.

382
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:48,954
I got fired today.

383
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:50,325
Fired?

384
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:51,829
You mean
for good?

385
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:53,831
You don't get
fired temporarily.

386
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,833
It's a permanent
lifetime firing.

387
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,339
It was on account
of Andrew,

388
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,842
the colored guy
who sweeps up.

389
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,311
Well, he lays his broom
against the table.

390
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,847
The broom slips,

391
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:12,850
knocks a can
of linseed oil over,

392
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:15,352
and ruins three
brand-new hats,

393
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:16,854
$9.00 Stetsons.

394
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:18,514
It wasn't his fault.

395
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:21,185
He didn't put
the linseed oil there.

396
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,625
Mr. Stroheim gets crazy.

397
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:26,859
He tells Andrew the hats
come out of his salary... $27.

398
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,866
Andrew starts to cry.

399
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,367
He cried?

400
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:33,530
42 years old,
he's bawling all over.

401
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:36,871
I said to Mr. Stroheim that it wasn't fair.
It wasn't Andrew's fault.

402
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,638
So Mr. Stroheim
screams at me...

403
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,045
When I tell you something,
you listen to me!

404
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:46,209
<i>Want to pay
for the hats, bigmouth?</i>

405
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:47,718
No, I don't want to pay
for the hats.

406
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:49,651
<i>Then mind your own business,
bigmouth.</i>

407
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:52,885
Bring the hats
back to the factory.

408
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,391
Know where it is?

409
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,893
The f-f-factory?

410
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,394
That's my job.

411
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,397
Am I speaking
to you, bigmouth?

412
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:00,898
Ask Mrs. Ludvig.

413
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:03,901
She will tell you
where the factory is.

414
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,960
They'll give you
three new hats.

415
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:09,064
If I see a finger mark on them,
you'll pay for them, too.

416
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:12,008
Understand?
Hmm?

417
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:13,408
Y-Y-Yes, sir.

418
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,175
Don't stand around.
You've wasted enough time.

419
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:18,910
Back to work.

420
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:21,919
This is not
the lunch hour.

421
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:33,362
You.

422
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:35,263
<i>Take the broom.</i>

423
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:37,598
<i>You'll sweep up
this week.</i>

424
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,604
<i>You are
the cleaning man.</i>

425
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,442
Again this account.

426
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:46,603
Enid, Enid, Enid.

427
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,273
<i>I told you 50 million
hundred thousand times...</i>

428
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:50,406
Mr. Stroheim!

429
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,885
I don't think
you're being fair.

430
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:07,464
You sweep that up,

431
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,297
or today
is your last day here.

432
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:14,972
You want me
to sweep it up?

433
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,803
I'll sweep it up.

434
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:24,713
Inside.

435
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,484
<i>You hear me?</i>

436
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:30,313
Inside!

437
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:53,010
Tonight
you will go home,

438
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:57,014
and you will write me
a letter of apology...

439
00:23:57,082 --> 00:24:00,017
which I will put
on the wall...

440
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:01,518
for everyone to see.

441
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,518
On my desk...

442
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,024
9:00 tomorrow morning.

443
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:09,026
Otherwise,
don't bother coming in.

444
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:10,527
Understood?

445
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,532
I understand,
Mr. Stroheim.

446
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:19,037
That's something
I'll just have to
think about tonight.

447
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:24,041
I'll finish
sweeping up the floor.

448
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:31,181
<i>[Waves Breaking]</i>

449
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,718
I don't know why I did it,
but I got so mad.

450
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:38,188
If you give in
when you're 181/2,

451
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:41,784
you'll give in for
the rest of your life,
don't you think?

452
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,555
I suppose so.

453
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:46,291
Are you going
to write the letter?

454
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:49,122
No.

455
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,070
Positively?

456
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:54,571
Positively.

457
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:59,076
Except I'll have
to discuss it with Pop.

458
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:01,578
I know we
need the money,

459
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:03,080
but he told me once,

460
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:06,083
you have to do
what you think is right...

461
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:08,585

a cake in the oven.

[Whispering]
I never understand
why we have to whisper.

466
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:28,105
Is the cake
afraid of people?

467
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:29,606
Go wash your face.

468
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:31,108
Give me the bread.

469
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:34,611
Hi, Mom!

470
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,944
[Whispering]
Shh! The cake
is sleeping.

471
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,446
Eugene! He purposely
does this to aggravate me!

472
00:25:42,521 --> 00:25:43,954
Shh!

473
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,952
I don't get
a kiss hello?

474
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:50,221
That's what
I wait for
all day.

475
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,490
Oh, a hug, too.

476
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:55,624
When do I ever get a hug?
You must have done
something wrong.

477
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,693
You're just
a cute lady, Mom.

<i>I can't help myself.</i>

479
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:01,638
Think I'll wash up.

480
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:07,144
Don't forget to ask your boss
to get paid tomorrow.

481
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:08,645
Saturday's a holiday.

482
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:10,147
I won't.

00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,149
Eugene! I hear the train.

484
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,650
Go meet your father.

485
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:16,654
Laurie! It's time
for your medicine!

486
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:18,155
Oh!

487
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,157
I'm so tired suddenly.

488
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:21,157
Mmm!

489
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:23,660
Oh!

490
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,162
Oh!

491
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,666
If you drink
my medicine,
I'll eat your liver.

492
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:30,167
What liver?

493
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:33,170
We're having liver
and cabbage for dinner.

494
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:34,671
Oh, my God!

495
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,174
Liver and cabbage...

496
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:40,006
AJewish
medieval torture.

497
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:43,180
My friend Marty Gregorio,

498
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:46,183
an "A" student in science,

499
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:48,549
told me that cooked cabbage
can be smelled...

500
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,111
farther than sound
traveling for seven minutes.

501
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:56,193
[Gasping]

502
00:26:56,261 --> 00:27:00,698
<i>Didn't I tell you
to get out of
that hot kitchen?</i>

503
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,199
I'm all right.
Come here.

504
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:04,201
[Gasping] Let me sit.
You sit down.

505
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,203
I can't breathe
in there,

506
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:08,205
and I don't
have asthma.

507
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,207
I'm sick
about your pitcher.

508
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:13,210
Your good crystal,
Kate.

509
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,212
Stop it.

510
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,713
I'll replace it.

511
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:18,716
Please don't
worry about it.

512
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,718
I can always
get pitchers.

513
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:22,720
Sisters, I can't
always find.

514
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,221
I'll clean it up.

515
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:25,722
You sit
right there!

516
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,055
Eugene will
clean it up
when he gets back.

517
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:41,238
Let me help you, Pop.

518
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:43,240
Be careful.
You'll hurt yourself.

519
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:44,741
No. No trouble.

520
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:49,747
How you doing, Pop?

521
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:51,248
Good.

522
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:54,251
I don't know
how you do it, Pop,

523
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,753
carrying these boxes
around every day.

524
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:58,756
King Kong
couldn't lift these.

525
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:01,759
You do what
you have to do.

526
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:05,158
[Honking]

527
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,266
Why you walking funny?

528
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:12,269
Oh, it's my sneakers.
The soles wore off.

529
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:15,773
I have to clench
my toes when I walk.

530
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,275
Can't you wear
Stanley's old pair?

531
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:20,277
Stanley's wearing
Stanley's old pair.

532
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,279
I walk on my heels...

533
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:25,578
because there's no skin
left on my toes.

534
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:29,786
Feeling better, Mom?

535
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:31,789
Much better, dear.

536
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:34,791
Feeling better, Mom?

537
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,293
Much better, dear.

538
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:42,557
<i>[Kate]Jack,
what's the matter?</i>

539
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,271
What's wrong?
Eugene said you were
holding your chest.

540
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,308
I wasn't
holding my chest.

541
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,570
Carrying those boxes
back and forth every day.

542
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:54,805
You're getting older, Jack.
Don't you work hard enough?

543
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,314
You want the boxes?
They're yours.

544
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:59,316
I don't need them
anymore.

545
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:00,817
What do you mean?

546
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:03,650
Del Mar Party Favors
went out of business.

547
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:06,987
<i>They closed him out.
The man's bankrupt.</i>

548
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,892
Never even warned me
it was coming.

549
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:12,987
You told me he lived
up on Riverside Drive.

550
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:15,795
A $300-a-month
apartment, he had.

551
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:18,335
Who do you think
goes bankrupt?

552
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:20,837
You live in
a cold-water flat,

553
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:23,841
bankruptcy is
the one thing
God spares you.

554
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,358
What are you doing?

555
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:42,324
<i>Astronomy.</i>

556
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:45,795
I have to bring in
a report tomorrow.

557
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:51,368
<i>[Stanley] Let me know
when she gets
to the Milky Way.</i>

558
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:52,869
<i>[Eugene] Damn.</i>

559
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:58,706
That dirty little pig.

560
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:01,143
He's watching Nora
getting undressed.

561
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,382
<i>I wonder ifhe'd
let me come over.</i>

562
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:09,750
I can't get by without
that extra $25 a week.

563
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:11,880
Stop it, Jack. You'll
make yourself sick.

564
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:14,892
He didn't even
pay me for the week.

565
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,052
The bastard.

566
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:17,891
Five salesmen
are laid off,

567
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:20,056
he's going to
a Broadway show tonight.

568
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:24,330
I stuffed every hat and noisemaker
I could carry into those boxes...
walked out of there.

569
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:28,896
At his funeral,
I'll put on a pointy hat
and blow a horn.

570
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:31,404
Something will come up.

571
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:34,639
Go to Temple and pray
all day Saturday.

572
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:37,409
Men have been praying
there for 40 years.

573
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:40,417
Know how many prayers
before my turn comes up?

574
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:41,884
Your turn
will come up.

575
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:44,217
God has time
for everybody.

576
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:49,555
Stanley!

577
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:50,890
Eugene!

578
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:52,361
Time to eat!

579
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:57,233
If you see a chance
to help me with Pop,

580
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:58,860
will you do it?

581
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:01,235
I was waiting
to get in the game.

582
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:03,399
Just give me
the ball, coach.

583
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:07,241
Don't say anything
about the Broadway show
to UncleJack.

584
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:09,246
Let me introduce
the subject.

585
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:12,613
I'm not allowed to talk
while I'm eating anyway.

586
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,585
Please don't
think about this
during dinner.

587
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:17,246
You'll give yourself
heartburn.

588
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:19,256
<i>[Blanche]Jack, Kate!
Everything's hot!</i>

589
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:20,757
We're coming!

590
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:23,760
Do you think
she'll ever get married?

591
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:24,920
Blanche?

592
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:26,429
She's not unattractive.

593
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:27,931
I see men look at her
on the beach.

594
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:29,762
What does she want
to waste her life in this house for?

595
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,803
Blanche
isn't the type
to get married.

596
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:34,304
She was married once.
Those are the type.

597
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:35,805
It was different.

598
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:38,308
<i>She isn't interested
in other men.
[Car Horn Honking]</i>

599
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:41,311
What about
that Murphy fellow
across the street?

600
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:42,812
He's plenty interested.

601
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,314
That drunk?

602
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:48,318
He can't find his way
into the house at night.

603
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:51,822
He slept in the doorway
once in the rain.

604
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,324
Shh. He's got a good-paying job.
Lives with his mother.

605
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:57,327
So he takes a drink
on a Saturday night?

606
00:31:57,395 --> 00:32:00,330
Maybe what he needs
is a good woman.

607
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:01,831
Not my sister.

608
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,333
<i>[Blanche]Jack! Kate!</i>

609
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:06,837
Let him meet
someone lying
in the next doorway.

610
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:15,098
<i>Chapter seven:
"The Infamous Dinner."</i>

611
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:31,989
<i>[Narrating] It started out
like a murder mystery.</i>

612
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:34,958
<i>No one said a word,</i>

613
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,119
<i>but everyone
looked suspicious.</i>

614
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,466
<i>Everyone had
one eye on their plate...</i>

615
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,798
<i>and the other eye
on Pop.</i>

616
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:46,029
Pickles!

617
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:53,476
<i>Except me.</i>

618
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:55,479
<i>I sat opposite Nora.</i>

619
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,642
Relish.

620
00:34:02,954 --> 00:34:05,479
<i>I kept dropping
my napkin a lot,</i>

621
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:07,491
<i>so I could bend down...</i>

622
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,494
<i>and look at those virginy,
creamy white legs.</i>

623
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:11,654
Ketchup.

624
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,195
<i>She was really
deep in thought...</i>

625
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:21,067
<i>because she left herself
unguarded a few times,</i>

626
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,506
<i>and I got to see
halfway up her thighs...</i>

627
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:28,012
<i>that led to the golden palace
of the Himalayas.</i>

628
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,312
Eugene.

629
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:39,121
Keep your napkin
on your lap.

630
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,189
<i>Stanley knew
what I was doing...</i>

631
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:46,526
<i>because he's the one
who taught it to me.</i>

632
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:52,069
<i>You could hear the clock
ticking in the kitchen.</i>

633
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:55,072
<i>The tension in the air
was so thick...</i>

634
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,075
<i>you could cut it
with a knife...</i>

635
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:02,079
<i>which is more than
I could say for the liver.</i>

636
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,601
I'll help
with the dessert.

637
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,102
Finish your liver.

638
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:29,106
I finished. Do you
see any liver?

639
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:31,608
You buried it
under your potatoes.

640
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:33,837
Look how Laurie
ate hers.

641
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:37,609
<i>One more bite,</i>

642
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:40,515
<i>and I would have
thrown up on the table,</i>

643
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:43,053
<i>a sight Nora would have

645
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:54,631
So how are things down
at Stroheim's, Stanley?

646
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,294
Yech.

647
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:03,132
<i>I felt bad about that.</i>

648
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,142
<i>But for the moment,</i>

649
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,146
<i>attention had shifted
away from my liver.</i>

650
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:12,149
How long you been
working there now?

651
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:13,479
Where?

652
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:14,984
At Stroheim's.

653
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,486
At Stroheim's?

654
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:17,987
Ayear and a half.

655
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:19,489
And he likes you?

656
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:20,649
Who?

657
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:24,160
Stroheim.

658
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:26,663
Yeah. Usually
he likes me.

659
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:28,198
Come in on time?

660
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:29,358
Always.

661
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:30,867
You do your work?

662
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:32,368
Get along
with people?

663
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:33,665
Why shouldn't
he like you?

I think I have
a bone in my throat.

So, what's new
at dancing school,
Nora?

674
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:10,740
Nothing's new.

675
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:12,435

<i>Just trying

What happened
at dancing school?

678
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:24,248
Nora received a very nice
compliment from Mr. Beckman.

679
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:29,255
He, uh... said
that she had, uh...

680
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,488
professional talent.

681
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,991
Mr. Beckman
is your teacher?

682
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:39,093
No. Mr. Beckman is
one of the most widely known...

683
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,263
and respected
producers on Broadway.

684

<i>[Jack] Broadway?
Imagine that.</i>

685
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:46,274
Isn't that
the same Mr. Beckman...

686
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:49,780
who's producing the great
Broadway extravaganza,

687

<i>Abracadabra?</i>

688
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,284
I hear if a girl
gets a part...

689
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:57,287
for the chorus
of a show like that,

690
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:59,289
not only is her career
practically guaranteed,

691
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:03,293
but the experience she gains is equal
to a four-year college education.

692
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,659
Eugene,
that's enough.

<i>[Kate] Boys, let your father

This is

What a great idea
for a radio show.

<i>The Family Hour.</i>

discussing their problems,

702
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:34,858

and featuring
tonight's specialty,

706
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:44,867
liver and cabbage.

707

Eugene,
sit down!

709
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:51,875
Nothing more
to discuss, anybody?

710
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:54,571
Otherwise,
I'll turn on the news.

711
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:57,877
Finish your liver,
I said.

712
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:59,382
I can't swallow it.

713
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,883
Eat half.

714
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:02,886
Which half?
They're both terrible.

715
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:04,387
Just one bite.

716
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:07,390
If I take one bite,
you'll make me take two bites.

717
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:10,985
I'll take it to my room.
I'll eat it tonight.

718
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:13,428
If nobody likes liver,
why do you make it?

719
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:16,899
Because we can't afford
roast beef for seven people.

I didn't take it.
They gave it to me.

723

<i>It's something
really important.</i>

726
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:38,188
More important than

I have to know tonight, Mother.

736
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:03,780
I have to tell
Mr. Beckman...

737
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:06,282
if I can
do the show.

738

It's not the time.

739

It's never the time.

740
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:11,321
You won't
make a decision.

741
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:13,823
I can't talk
to anyone else.

00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,825
I'll make
my own decisions...

743
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:18,327
if no one else
is interested.

744

You really think there
will be a war, Pop?

I mean, America, too?

749
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:31,902

00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:39,382
Yes. My cousin

754
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:42,249

<i>God knows what will

Jack, talk to Nora.

You're the only one
she'll listen to.

758
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:51,760
What if they all
got to America, Pop?

759
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,194
Where would they live?

760
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:55,095
Would we take them in?

761
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:58,101
What God gives us to deal with,
we deal with.

762

Where would we put them
if they got off the boat?

763
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:05,101
How would we feed them?
The boat didn't get here yet.

764
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:08,304
I can't deal
with boats that
haven't landed yet.

<i>[Stanley]

Where are you going?

767
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:14,782
To the drugstore.

768
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:16,649
I'm getting

<i>I'll get it.
You shouldn't

770
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,281
Kate, you have got
to stop thinking...

771
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,658
everybody is
your responsibility.

772
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:32,169
Stan, who has
the best boobs
in the neighborhood?

773
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:35,672
Is sex the only thing
you ever think about?

774
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,173
I think Mrs. Laski has.

775
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:41,177
Boy, would I love
to wrap my hands
around them.

776
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,678
She's jumbo-size.

777
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:44,681
Your hands
aren't big enough.

778
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:48,185
If I wore two
baseball gloves,
they would be.

779
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:58,819
Can I give you a lift home,
Mrs. Morton?

780
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:01,228
Oh, hello, Mr. Murphy.

781
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:02,732
It's only two blocks.

782
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,199
<i>It's not the distance.</i>

783
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:05,735
It's the company.

784
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:08,802
All right. Thank you.

785
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,908
Ooh. Is this your car?

786
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:13,910
Mine? No.
Cars are luxuries.

787
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:16,412
I have no aspirations
for luxuries.

788
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,914
I do, however,
have a weakness...

789
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:21,816
for friends who have
aspirations for luxuries.

790
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:23,979
Well...

791
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:28,057
You've an Irish smile,
you know.

792
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,389

Uh...

00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:33,563
Oh, I don't at all.

795
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:37,734
Is that what they call
blarney, Mr. Murphy?

796
00:42:37,802 --> 00:42:39,235
Yes, it is, definitely.

797
00:42:39,303 --> 00:42:42,238
But it's a handy way
of getting attention...

798
00:42:42,306 --> 00:42:45,742
from someone you want
to take notice of you.

799
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,244
I've taken notice
of you, Mrs. Morton,

800
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:49,745
for many months now.

801
00:42:49,814 --> 00:42:52,248
Yes, Mr. Murphy,
I've taken notice.

802
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:00,423
I had a dream last night.

803
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,459
It was about a girl.

804
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:04,960
I can't tell you
her name,

805
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:06,462
but she was gorgeous.

806
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,464
We were really
kissing hard...

807
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:12,195
and rubbing up
against each other.

808
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:17,139
And I felt this
tremendous build-up coming.

809
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,768
And suddenly...

810
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:22,938
there was
this explosion...

811
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:26,649
like a dam broke.

812
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:29,652
And suddenly,
everything rushed...

813
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,654
and flowed out to sea.

814
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:36,159
It was
the greatest feeling...

815
00:43:36,227 --> 00:43:38,661
I ever had in my life.

816
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:41,755
And when I woke up,
I was...

817
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:42,856
<i>All wet?</i>

818
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:44,902
It was a wet dream.

819
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:47,665
I have them
all the time.

820
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:49,035
<i>You do?</i>

821
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:52,166
You mean, there's
nothing wrong with you...

822
00:43:52,243 --> 00:43:53,676
if it happens?

823
00:43:53,744 --> 00:43:55,177
You never had one?

824
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:57,680
Yeah, but I slept
through it.

825
00:43:57,748 --> 00:44:01,184
Didn't you ever try
to do it by yourself?

826
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:06,355
What do you mean?

827
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:10,124
Didn't you ever
diddle with yourself?

828
00:44:10,194 --> 00:44:11,126
No!

829
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:12,219
Never!

830
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:13,627
Baloney. I've heard you.

831
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:15,893
You diddle three, four
times a week.

832
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:17,696
You're crazy!

833
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:23,639
You've gone five blocks
out of your way.

834
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:28,145
Eight. I know
a short cut
that can add six.

835
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:36,144
<i>[Blanche] Oh, my God.</i>

836
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,209
<i>[Murphy] What's wrong?</i>

837
00:44:37,288 --> 00:44:38,880
Uh, it's my sister.

838
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:40,423
Please stop the car.

839
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:41,890
I have to get out.

840
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:44,951
Because
you'd rather not
be seen with me?

841
00:44:45,029 --> 00:44:46,121
No, honestly.

842
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:50,300
She doesn't
care for me.
I know that.

843
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:51,767
She's never said that.

844
00:44:51,836 --> 00:44:53,997
Some people think
I'm too carefree,

845
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:57,165
but I'm an honest man
and I would never show you
any disrespect.

846
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:58,674
I'm sure of that.

847
00:44:58,743 --> 00:45:02,679
Then will you
have dinner with me
Wednesday at Chardhov's?

848
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:05,181
It's a very respectable
family establishment.

849
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:08,417
Yes, I will.

850
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:13,484
Uh, thank you
for the ride.

851
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:25,201
Kate, what are you
doing out?

852
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:28,204
I told Laurie I'd
get her some licorice.

853
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:30,706
She woke up drenched
in perspiration.

854
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:33,471
Come on. I'm dying
for something sweet.

855
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:39,640
There's nothing
wrong with it.

856
00:45:39,717 --> 00:45:42,652
Everybody does it,
especially at our age.

857
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,982
It's natural.

858
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:46,819
I can't believe I'm
having this conversation.

859
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:49,655
You can't grow up
without doing it.

860
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:51,194
Your voice won't change.

861
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:57,166
Where do you
get this stuff from?

862
00:45:57,234 --> 00:46:00,169
Is it in a medical book
or something?

863
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:01,329
It's puberty.

864
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:02,838
It's what?

865
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:05,842
Puberty.
You never heard
that word before?

866
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,844
Don't you
read books?

867
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:10,346
<i>Yeah. The Count
of Monte Cristo.</i>

868
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:12,006
It never
mentioned puberty.

869
00:46:16,754 --> 00:46:18,312
Even Pop did it.

870
00:46:19,557 --> 00:46:20,649
Pop?

871
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:23,590
Our Pop?

872
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:28,499
You know, Stanley,
I think you're
full of shit.

873
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:30,467
Don't use that language.
You're just a kid.

874
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:32,764
Never let me hear you
say that word again.

875
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:34,395
It's okay for you
to say puberty,

876
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:35,905
but I can't say shit?

877
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:37,838
<i>"Puberty"
is a scientific word.</i>

878
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:41,036
<i>"Shit" is for guys who
hang around the beach.</i>

879
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:44,206
Well, what do you
expect me to say...

880
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,216
when you tell me
that Pop whacks off?

881
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:50,219
I don't mean he still does,
because he's married now.

882
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,847
But when he was a kid,
14, 15...

883
00:46:54,058 --> 00:46:56,117
The whole world
whacks off.

884
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,468
President Roosevelt, too?

885
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:08,772
Sometimes I forget
his birthday,

886
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,774
but the day he died
I'll never forget.

887
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:14,276
You talk
like life is over.

888
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:17,280
You're still
attractive, if you'd
only stop squinting.

889
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:20,283
You got to get out
of the house.

890
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:21,579
I'll get out.

891
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:24,280
Jack's company's having
their annual affair...

892
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:26,789
next Wednesday
at the Commodore Hotel.

893
00:47:26,857 --> 00:47:29,655
Jack wants you
to come with us.

894
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:31,558
He told me to ask you.

895
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:36,132
Me? Who do I know
in Jack's company?

896
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,633
You'll be with us.

897
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:39,134
You'll meet people.

898
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:41,637
Max Green will be
at our table.

899
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:44,105
He's their
number one salesman.

900
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:45,642
He's a riot.
You'll love him.

901
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:47,142
He's a widower.

902
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:49,145
His wife died
last year.

903
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:50,339
[Whispers] Tuberculosis.

904
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:52,473
I appreciate it, Kate,

905
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,814
but I've, um...

906
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,089
I've made plans
for next Wednesday night.

907
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:00,248
More important
than this?

908
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:02,758
They have this
once a year.

909
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:04,384
I'm having
dinner with...

910
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:06,758
someone.

911
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:10,266
You're having dinner
with a man?

912
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:11,596
That's wonderful.

913
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,728
Why didn't you tell me?

914
00:48:13,804 --> 00:48:14,998
With Mr. Murphy.

915
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:16,369
Who is Mr. Mur...

916
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,706
Oh, my God.

917
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:24,380
You're having dinner
with that man?

918
00:48:24,448 --> 00:48:27,383
He'll take you
to a bar and grill.

919
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:30,386
We are going
to Chardhov's,
the Hungarian restaurant.

920
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:31,887
You've never met him.

921
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:34,390
How can you
dislike him so?

922
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,585
I don't have to
meet that kind.

923
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,151
I just have to
smell his breath...

924
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,289
when he opens
the window.

925
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:44,901
Do girls whack off, too?

926
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:47,403
Five times
as much as boys.

927
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:49,405
Five times as much.

928
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:52,909
Is that an actual figure?

929
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:55,912
Where do you know
all this from?

930
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,413
You pick it up.

931
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:58,914
You learn it.

932
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:01,918
It's handed down
from generation
to generation.

933
00:49:01,986 --> 00:49:03,920
That's how our
culture spreads.

934
00:49:03,988 --> 00:49:06,422
Five times
as much as boys.

935
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,424
Some don't even
say hello,

936
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:11,427
and they're home
all night whacking off.

937
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:13,429
They're human
like we are.

938
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:16,591
They have the same
needs and desires.

939
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:20,501
 Two arms
that held me 

940
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:23,734
<i> Two lips
that thrilled me </i>

941
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,468
<i> Two eyes met mine 떰</i>

942
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:27,476
How do girls do it?

943
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:30,145
I can't explain it.

944
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:36,275
I'll buy you
an ice cream.

945
00:49:37,388 --> 00:49:40,653
Please,
I'll be your slave
for a month.

946
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,555
Tell me
how they do it.

947
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:44,651
Eugene, I have a
major problem in my life.

948
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:46,161
I haven't got time...

949
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,663
to describe
girls masturbating.

950
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:49,164
Draw me a picture.

951
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:50,666
I brought a pencil.

952
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:54,670
Ooh!
You want crayons?
Maybe you should do it in color.

953
00:49:54,738 --> 00:49:56,171
Hey, I'll race you.

954
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,707
Hey!

955
00:49:59,243 --> 00:50:02,178
What do you think
he's looking for, hmm?

956
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:05,181
We grew up
with their kind
on Avenue A.

957
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:08,184
How many times
have Stanley and Eugene
come home black and blue...

958
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:10,686
from the beatings
from those Irish hooligans?

959
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:12,187
You're not being fair.

960
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:14,690
We walked along
the beach Thursday.

961
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,191
He was extremely polite.

962
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,195
He told me where his parents
came from in Ireland.

963
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,198
Their life wasn't easier
than Mama's and Papa's.

964
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:25,201
Nobody had it
like they did in Russia.

965
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:27,203
He has a decent job.

966
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:29,205
He didn't
smell of liquor.

967
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:31,707
He behaved like
a perfect gentleman.

968
00:50:31,775 --> 00:50:35,211
That was on the beach.
They're different when the sun goes down.

969
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:36,610
Do what you want.

970
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:40,282
I'll bet Nora
doesn't do it.

971
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:42,785
Could I win money
from you.

972
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:44,787
Think she's
in the bathroom...

973
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:47,289
seven times a day
taking showers?

974
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:48,791
I don't believe it.

975
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:51,293
She the one
you dreamed about?

976
00:50:51,362 --> 00:50:54,297
No. It was somebody
else... a beach girl.

977
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:57,300
It was Nora. I see
what's going on.

978
00:50:57,368 --> 00:51:00,303
That's why you dropped
your napkin at dinner.

979
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:01,804
She drives me crazy.

980
00:51:01,872 --> 00:51:04,864
I think I'm in love
with her.

981
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,644
Well, forget it.
She's your cousin.

982
00:51:08,712 --> 00:51:11,647
What's wrong with being
in love with her?

983
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:14,183
It's against
the laws of nature.

984
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:16,685
You can't marry
your first cousin.

985
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:19,154
You get babies
with nine heads.

986
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:25,127
One dinner
with Frank Murphy
at Chardhov's...

987
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:27,629
isn't the end
of the world.

988
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:30,633
I just don't want
to see you hurt.

989
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:32,635
I never mean you harm.

990
00:51:32,703 --> 00:51:34,136
I can take anything,

991
00:51:34,204 --> 00:51:38,140
except when someone
in the family
is mad at me.

992
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,644
Oh, I could never
be mad at you, Kate.

993
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:44,681
That I promise you
to my dying day.

994
00:51:46,116 --> 00:51:49,051
Don't expect me
to be too friendly.

995
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,714
I'll put out nuts,
but not beer.

996
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:01,595
Can I see
Mr. Beckman tomorrow?

997
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:03,326
Yes or no?

998
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:07,196
Did you talk to
your UncleJack?

999
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:10,297
It doesn't matter.
It's your decision
or mine.

1000
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:12,239
Who's going
to make it?

1001
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:15,301
I said if I were
her father,

1002
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:17,813
I'd have her
finish high school.

1003
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:19,815
There will
be other shows.

1004
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:20,975
Be patient.

1005
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:22,450
Don't shut me in.

1006
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:24,885
Don't shut me in
for life.

1007
00:52:24,955 --> 00:52:28,914
You promised you'd do
what UncleJack said.

1008
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:31,586
He doesn't
make decisions.

1009
00:52:31,662 --> 00:52:32,993
He offers advice.

1010
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:36,089
I want a decision,
Mama, from you.

1011
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,326
Please?

1012
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:42,262
You finish high school.

1013
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:45,274
You tell Mr. Beckman
you're too young.

1014
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:48,641
You tell him
your mother said...

1015
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:49,770
no.

1016
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:53,505
That's my decision.

1017
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:56,411
I see.

1018
00:52:57,988 --> 00:53:00,479
Thank you, UncleJack,
for your advice.

1019
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:07,263
I'll let you know
in the morning...

1020
00:53:07,331 --> 00:53:08,764
<i>what my decision is.</i>

1021
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:12,928
I would love
to see Nora naked
just once, wouldn't you?

1022
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:15,870
I have.
Plenty of times.

1023
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:20,900
<i>[Honking]</i>

1024
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:25,275
You've seen Nora naked?

1025
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:26,441
Sure.

1026
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:30,619
I fixed the lock
on the bathroom door,

1027
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:34,123
then opened it,
pretending I didn't know
anyone was there.

1028
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:35,624
What a disgusting pig!

1029
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:38,627
Will you show me
how to work it?

1030
00:53:38,695 --> 00:53:39,787
Hello, boys!

1031
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,626
Oh, hello,
Mr. Murphy.

1032
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:43,131
Lovely night, hmm?
Lovely night, indeed.

1033
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,998
Yes, indeedy.

1034
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:48,264
Yes, indeedy.

1035
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:51,637
<i>[Stanley] I think that guy
thinks he's in
a Shakespeare play.</i>

1036
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,506
<i>[Eugene] He had a couple
in there, I bet.</i>

1037
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:59,114
You think he
and Aunt Blanche do it?

1038
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:00,615
Nah. She's a widow.

1039
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:02,618
Widows don't
do those things.

1040
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:06,122
Don't hate me for what
I'm going to say.

1041
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:07,622
What is it?

1042
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:10,626
I think Aunt Blanche
has a great ass.

1043
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:13,629
They'll lock you up
in a sex asylum.

1044
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:15,631
If I was
your sister,

1045
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:17,633
I wouldn't sleep
on the same block with you.

1046
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:19,635
What if they
showered together?

1047
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:21,603
If I could see that,

1048
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:24,607
I would thank God
and become a rabbi.

1049
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,267
Come on.

1050
00:54:29,112 --> 00:54:31,080
When does it get
easier, Kate?

1051
00:54:31,148 --> 00:54:34,584
When you get
seven good hours
sleep a night.

1052
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,051
That's the easiest
it ever gets.

1053
00:54:49,299 --> 00:54:50,391
He's home.

1054
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:53,402
You going
to talk to him now?

1055
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:54,903
It's now or never.

1056
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:57,231
Good luck.

1057
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:03,412
Hi, Pop.

1058
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,415
You think we could
have that talk now?

1059
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:07,916
You fixed the radio?

1060
00:55:07,985 --> 00:55:09,418
Works better than new.

1061
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:10,953
It's almost 10:00.

1062
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:13,512
<i>I can get
the late news.</i>

1063
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,922
I'm going to finish my homework.
Good night.

1064
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:18,427
<i>[Kate] Put the cookie
on the table.</i>

1065
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:20,888
What cookie?

1066
00:55:20,964 --> 00:55:23,524
The oatmeal cookie
in your pocket.

1067
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,227
Put it on the table.

1068
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:30,171
You can smell
an oatmeal cookie
from 10 feet away?

1069
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:34,435
I heard the jar moving
in the kitchen.

1070
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:37,446
Suddenly, everybody
is doing what they want.

1071
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:39,778
Your father's upset,
Aunt Blanche is upset,

1072
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:40,942
Nora is upset.

1073
00:55:41,018 --> 00:55:43,282
Put the cookie
on the table!

1074
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:01,970
Could we
sit outside?

1075
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:03,973
Everyone's
always coming
through here.

1076
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:06,475
But the news
is coming on.

1077
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:07,976
Talk wherever you want.

1078
00:56:08,045 --> 00:56:09,512
I'm going to bed.

1079
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:12,576
Five minutes. That's all.

1080
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,798
Eugene!

1081
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:30,391
What?

1082
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:33,334
Give me that cookie.

1083
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:41,136
Why don't you
sit down, Pop?

1084
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:42,872
Some build-up this is.

1085
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:48,040
[Sighs]

1086
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,010
Pop, I have
a problem.

1087
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:54,114
If you didn't,
you wouldn't live
in this house.

1088
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:01,019
Close the door!

1089
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:02,087
Close the door!

1090
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:03,097
I'm sorry!

1091
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:05,191
Something must be
wrong with the lock.

1092
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:10,798
It must be tough
being a father.

1093
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:12,432
Everybody comes to you
with their problems.

1094
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:15,945
You have to have
all the answers.

1095
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:19,072
Stop trying to win me over.
Just tell me the problem.

1096
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:20,343
I got fired today.

1097
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:21,748
What?

1098
00:57:21,818 --> 00:57:23,251
Don't get excited.

1099
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,753
I'll explain
what happened.

1100
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:27,346
What did you do? You came in late?
You were fresh to somebody?

1101
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:30,188
Were you fresh?
I could still get my job back.

1102
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,592
Just help me
make a decision.

1103
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:34,289
Take the job back.
I don't care what it is.

1104
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:35,797
This isn't the time...

1105
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:38,960
for anybody
in this family
to be out of work.

1106
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,838
She saw me
on the crapper.

1107
00:57:43,907 --> 00:57:46,341
Nora saw me
on the crapper.

1108
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:48,877
I might as well
be dead!

1109
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:54,883
Be careful when you go
into the bathroom.

1110
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:56,384
The lock's broken.

1111
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:57,385
Who cares?

1112
00:57:57,454 --> 00:57:59,888
Nobody wants
to see me showering.

1113
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:01,389
What do you mean?

1114
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:05,894
I mean, some people
in this house...

1115
00:58:05,962 --> 00:58:07,896
are very handy
with screwdrivers.

1116
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:15,404
<i>[Stanley] When I was 12 years old,
you talked to me about principles.
Remember?</i>

1117
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:18,908
<i>[Jack] Principles are one thing,
losing yourjob is another.</i>

1118
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:20,909
<i>Can't I explain

01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:47,141
Jesus, I think
I'm going to throw up.

1271
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:48,336
[Coughs]

1272
01:07:57,754 --> 01:07:59,688
Well! You must've
been hungry.

1273
01:07:59,756 --> 01:08:00,586
That's a good sign.

1274
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:04,649
I was bored. I had
nothing else to do.

1275
01:08:06,262 --> 01:08:08,196
Blanche will
come into see you
before she goes.

1276
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:10,323
Tell her
she looks beautiful.

1277
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,698
<i>You know she's got
no confidence.</i>

1278
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:15,829
When did I last tell you
you were beautiful?

1279
01:08:15,905 --> 01:08:19,341
Why do you
bring that up now?

1280
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:24,369
I realize sometimes
I forget to tell
people how I feel.

1281
01:08:29,786 --> 01:08:30,718
Get better.

1282
01:08:30,787 --> 01:08:33,722
Take me to the affair
next year.

1283
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:35,223
Then I'll be beautiful.

1284
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:51,467
If he wasn't so sick,
I'd tell him the truth.

1285
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:53,975
If he dies,
I'll hang myself.

1286
01:08:54,043 --> 01:08:56,477
Just say
you lost the money.

1287
01:08:56,546 --> 01:08:58,912
I already used
that one.
When?

1288
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:02,883
November, when I lost $5.00.
He said, "Check your pockets
every morning."

1289
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:05,250
Did you gamble
the $5.00, too?

1290
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:07,619
No, I gave it to a girl,
a pro.

1291
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:08,816
A pro what?

1292
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:11,825
A prostitute?

1293
01:09:11,894 --> 01:09:15,830
You went to one of those places?
Holy shit!

1294
01:09:15,898 --> 01:09:17,866
Don't say
that word again.

1295
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,367
It costs $5.00?

1296
01:09:19,435 --> 01:09:21,369
$2.50. This guy
still owes me.

1297
01:09:21,437 --> 01:09:23,905
What was she like?
Was she pretty?
How old was she?

1298
01:09:23,973 --> 01:09:25,133
Don't start in
with me.

1299
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:26,937
Did she get
completely naked?

1300
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:30,206
Every time I get in trouble,
I have to tell you what a naked girl
looks like?

1301
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,873
Do me a favor.
Go in the bathroom,
whack off,

1302
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:34,883
and grow up
by yourself.

1303
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:42,118
I'm going out.

1304
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:45,126
<i>I'll be home late.
Good night.</i>

1305
01:09:45,194 --> 01:09:46,126
Going where?

1306
01:09:46,195 --> 01:09:49,824
I have a date
with Larry Clurman.

1307
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:52,697
Don't you want to see
how your mother looks?

1308
01:09:52,768 --> 01:09:55,965
I'm sure she looks beautiful.
She doesn't need me to tell her.

1309
01:09:56,038 --> 01:09:58,336
I think your mother
would be very hurt...

1310
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:00,773
if you didn't wait
to say good-bye.

1311
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:04,210
I know exactly how
my mother feels, UncleJack.

1312
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,340
I'm not sure
she knows how I feel.

1313
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:10,614
Nora!

1314
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:17,292
Nora!

1315
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,295
Do you want to
come help me?

1316
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:26,767
Nora!

1317
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:42,783
Will you cut it out?
I'm trying to think.

1318
01:10:42,852 --> 01:10:44,285
Don't get sore.

1319
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:46,787
It's not my fault
what happened.

1320
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:49,290
I never had
an older brother...

1321
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:51,292
to help me
with problems.

1322
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,261
You're lucky
to be the younger one.

1323
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,298
You don't have
my responsibilities.

1324
01:10:56,365 --> 01:10:59,300
You're still in school
looking up girls' dresses.

1325
01:10:59,368 --> 01:11:01,802
I work plenty hard
in school.

1326
01:11:01,871 --> 01:11:02,803
Yeah?

1327
01:11:02,872 --> 01:11:03,804
Yeah.

1328
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:06,307
Well, let me see
your report card.

1329
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,809
Yesterday was
the first of the month.
I know you got it.

1330
01:11:08,878 --> 01:11:11,312
I don't have
to show you.

1331
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,813
You're not
my father.

1332
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:15,817
As long as Pop
is sick, I am.

1333
01:11:15,885 --> 01:11:18,547
I'm the only one
in the family working.

1334
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:21,818
Really? Well,
where's your salary
this week, Pop?

1335
01:11:21,891 --> 01:11:23,290
I hate you sometimes.
I always help you,

1336
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,295
and you never help me
without wanting
something for it.

1337
01:11:27,363 --> 01:11:29,297
I hate
your disgusting guts!

1338
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:30,798
Not as much
as I hate yours.

1339
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:32,299
You snore at night,

1340
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:33,801
you pick
your toenails,

1341
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:35,803
you smell up
the bathroom.

1342
01:11:35,871 --> 01:11:37,805
Give me
your report card.

1343
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:39,306
I'll beat your face.

1344
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,808
You want it?

1345
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:41,968
Yeah.

1346
01:11:42,044 --> 01:11:44,808
Here's my lousy
report card!

1347
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,313
You fuck!

1348
01:11:52,355 --> 01:11:54,289
Four A's and a "B"?

1349
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:57,784
Jack? Jack?

1350
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:01,796
What are you doing
down here?

1351
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:03,798
I want
to meet Murphy.

1352
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:07,996
A stranger comes in,
he likes meeting
another man.

1353
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,537
<i>It makes him feel
comfortable.</i>

1354
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:12,836
I got so scared
when I didn't see you
in your room.

1355
01:12:12,908 --> 01:12:16,105
You don't look it.
You look beautiful.

1356
01:12:16,178 --> 01:12:19,409
Here. Wear these.

1357
01:12:19,482 --> 01:12:20,972
Don't say no to me.

1358
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,985
Just let me
put them on.

1359
01:12:24,053 --> 01:12:26,487
Kate, your pearls.
Your good pearls.

1360
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:27,988
What would they do,

1361
01:12:28,057 --> 01:12:30,491
sit in a drawer
all year?

1362
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:31,992
Pearls are like people.

1363
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:35,519
They like to go out
and be seen occasionally.

1364
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:39,534
Oh, you were going
to wear these to
tonight's affair.

1365
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:42,537
I got so wrapped up
in myself,

1366
01:12:42,605 --> 01:12:45,540
I forgot you were
missing the affair.

1367
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:47,269
<i>I'm afraid
I'll lose them.</i>

1368
01:12:47,343 --> 01:12:49,811
Let's see
how they look, Mom.

1369
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:52,746
Laurie, go up
and get Nora.

1370
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:55,750
I want to show
them to Nora.

1371
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:58,519
<i>[Laurie] She's not here.</i>

1372
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:03,381
She left.

1373
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:08,028
What do you mean,
she left?

1374
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:09,530
Without saying
good-bye?

1375
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,532
She had
to meet somebody,

1376
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,398
so you'll see her
when she comes home.

1377
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,938
She could've come to my room.
She knew I wanted
to see her.

1378
01:13:17,006 --> 01:13:20,373
You're going out
to have a good time.

1379
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:22,343
You'll deal
with this later.

1380
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:25,346
She's making me
pay for it, isn't she?

1381
01:13:25,414 --> 01:13:29,350
She knows how she can
get to me so easily.

1382
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:32,854
That's what I get for
trying to make decisions.

1383
01:13:32,922 --> 01:13:37,518

[Sobbing]

1386
01:13:59,582 --> 01:14:02,517
I feel like ice cream
for dessert.

1387
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:05,918
Laurie, do you feel
like ice cream?

1388
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:07,387
Butter pecan?

1389
01:14:07,456 --> 01:14:10,482
Butter pecan for you,
maple walnut for me.

1390
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,050
<i>Go up and tell Eugene...</i>

1391
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:15,962
<i>I want him
to go to the store.</i>

1392

<i>[Eugene] She's doing it.</i>

1393
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:26,631
<i>She's taking
everything off.</i>

1394
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:29,240
<i>Today's the day.</i>

<i>Please, God,
don't let it get foggy.</i>

01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,618
<i>to go to the store.</i>

1399
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:38,550
<i>Damn.</i>

1400
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,714
Tell him I'm sick.

1401
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,724
Tell him
I have diarrhea.

1402
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:45,226
<i>You don't want
any ice cream?</i>

1403
01:14:45,294 --> 01:14:47,990
Ice cream?
Wait a minute.

1404
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:52,366
You want
some ice cream, Stan?

1405
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:53,560
<i>No.</i>

1406
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:55,570
I have no will power.

1407
01:14:55,638 --> 01:14:59,074
How will I be a writer
unless I suffer?

1408
01:14:59,141 --> 01:15:01,075
Actually,
I'd give up writing...

1409
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:04,078
if I could see
a naked girl...

1410
01:15:04,146 --> 01:15:05,579

1413
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:17,925
Laurie will tell you
what to get.

1414
01:15:17,993 --> 01:15:19,255
I need money.

1415
01:15:19,328 --> 01:15:21,762
I just paid
the doctor $15.

1416
01:15:21,831 --> 01:15:23,264
Stanley got paid today.

1417
01:15:23,332 --> 01:15:25,266
Ask him for his salary.

1418

Here's a dollar.

1419

Hurry back so Laurie
can meet Mr. Murphy.

1420
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:35,337
I'll race you.
I'll hop on one leg.

1421
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:37,106
I'm not allowed
to run.

1422
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:39,147
I'll hop on one leg

1425
01:15:46,622 --> 01:15:49,056
<i>[Eugene] I think
she's calling you.</i>

1426
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:50,682
What does she want?

1427
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:53,728
She wants you to taste
her spider soup.

1428
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:55,058
Stop that!

1429
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:57,064
You think I should go?

1430
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:59,157
Sure. She's okay.

1431
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:01,430
I'll get
the ice cream.

1432
01:16:01,503 --> 01:16:03,937
Don't stay
in there too long,

1433
01:16:04,006 --> 01:16:05,837
or else
you'll become Irish.

1434
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:19,052
[Sniffling]

1435
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:22,046
Maybe she's
not coming back.

1436
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:25,287
Maybe she's...
she's run off to Boston...

1437
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:28,421
and then, uh,
Washington...

1438
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:30,260
or God knows where.

1439
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:33,631
Is that what
you'll talk about
on your date?

1440
01:16:33,702 --> 01:16:36,136
He'll start drinking
in five minutes.

1441
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:37,536
Oh, you think so?

1442
01:16:37,606 --> 01:16:40,507
What will I do
if he gets drunk?

1443
01:16:40,576 --> 01:16:42,009
You come right home.

1444
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:44,511
Do you have money
for carfare?

1445
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,105
No, I didn't
take anything.

1446
01:16:47,182 --> 01:16:48,649
Wait. Wait here.

1447
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:50,651
I'll get $5.00
from Stanley.

1448
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,654
Now I have
something else
to worry about.

1449
01:16:57,059 --> 01:16:58,993
Stanley,
are you in there?

1450
01:17:00,396 --> 01:17:01,658
Open the window.

1451
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:04,665
You never get air
in this room.

1452
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:07,497
I need $5.00
for Aunt Blanche.

1453
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:10,003
Stanley. Did you
get paid today?

1454
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:11,505
Yeah, I got paid.

1455
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:14,508
Well, take out
the money for the week.

1456
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:16,009
Give me the envelope.

1457
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:17,443
I don't have it.

1458
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:19,447
You don't have
the envelope?

1459
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:21,278
I don't have
the money.

1460
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,079
You don't have
the money?

1461
01:17:23,152 --> 01:17:25,985
I don't have the money.
It's gone.

1462
01:17:26,055 --> 01:17:27,579
<i>It's gone.
Gone where?</i>

1463
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,222
It's just gone.

1464
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:33,556
I don't have it.

1465
01:17:33,629 --> 01:17:35,392
I can't get it back.

1466
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:38,228
There's nothing
I can do about it.

1467
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,098
Just don't ask me
any more questions?

1468
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,661
Don't ask you
any more questions?

1469
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:45,673
What happened
to $17, Stanley?

1470
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:48,642
If I tell you,
you'll tell Pop.

1471
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:51,145
Why shouldn't I tell
your fa...

1472
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:56,751
Stanley,
I want to know...

1473
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:58,844
what happened
to that money.

1474
01:18:00,155 --> 01:18:01,520
I gambled it.

1475
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,059
<i>I lost it playing pool.</i>

1476
01:18:06,762 --> 01:18:08,161
All right?

1477
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,323
You happy?

1478
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,731
<i>You satisfied now?</i>

1479
01:18:15,137 --> 01:18:17,571
I won't think
about this now.

1480
01:18:19,141 --> 01:18:21,075
I'll have
your Aunt Blanche...

1481
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:23,509
get out
of the house first.

1482
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:26,514
I have
your father's health
to worry about.

1483
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:29,517
You'll sit here and
think up a story.

1484
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:30,847
You were robbed.

1485
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:33,854
Tell your father
somebody stole
the money.

1486
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:36,823
Because if you
tell him the truth,

1487
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:38,154
you'll kill him.

1488
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:40,858
Oh. I don't...

1489
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,124
Why am I so nervous?

1490
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:46,133
I guarantee you
he's twice as nervous.

1491
01:18:46,201 --> 01:18:47,759
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

1492
01:18:47,836 --> 01:18:50,134
Ooh. [Laughs]
He's at the door.

1493
01:18:50,205 --> 01:18:52,537
Stay here. Stay here.

1494
01:18:52,608 --> 01:18:54,269
I'll... Don't...

1495
01:18:54,343 --> 01:18:55,640
Don't get up.

1496
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:02,206
Oh, I thought
I heard someone.

1497
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:07,887
Kate!

1498
01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:10,288
What is it?

1499
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,023
What's wrong?

1500
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:14,357
Oh, it's nothing.

1501
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,364
I'm just
all nerves today.

1502
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:17,865
You're worried
aboutJack.

1503
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:20,925
He shouldn't
have come
down those stairs.

1504
01:19:21,003 --> 01:19:24,939
He knows
he's not supposed
to get out of bed.

1505
01:19:25,007 --> 01:19:28,272
I shouldn't have
asked Mr. Murphy
to come over.

1506
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:30,208
That's why
Jack came down.

1507
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:32,008
It's not
just Mr. Murphy.

1508
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:33,514
It's Stanley,
Eugene, everybody.

1509
01:19:33,582 --> 01:19:35,516
Everybody has
a problem here.

1510
01:19:36,952 --> 01:19:39,921
Did Nora say something
to hurt you, Kate?

1511
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:42,855
Get your purse.
He'll be here any minute.

1512
01:19:42,925 --> 01:19:44,859
I know
she's been difficult...

1513
01:19:44,927 --> 01:19:46,394
these last few days.

1514
01:19:46,462 --> 01:19:48,396
Why is it
always Nora?

1515
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:49,897
It's always
your problems.

1516
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:52,866
You're not
the only one who
has troubles.

1517
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:54,300
We all
have troubles.

1518
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:58,436
Well... forgive me.
I'm sorry, Kate.

1519
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:00,702
I... I understand.

1520
01:20:00,776 --> 01:20:02,038
Yes? What?

1521
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:05,046
I have just been
in the creepiest place...

1522
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:06,775
in the whole world.

1523
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:08,749
Not now, Laurie.

1524
01:20:08,817 --> 01:20:11,251
Aunt Kate and I
are talking.

1525
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,788
I was in
Mrs. Murphy's house.

1526
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:15,790
She asked if you
could come over now.

1527
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:17,655
She said
it was important.

1528
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,261
What is it?

1529
01:20:23,332 --> 01:20:26,665
She didn't tell me.
I just wanted
to get out of there.

1530
01:20:26,735 --> 01:20:29,966
Then she gave me
a green cookie. Yech.

1531
01:20:32,274 --> 01:20:34,708
Maybe he has
to work late.

1532
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:36,209
I'll be right back.

1533
01:20:36,278 --> 01:20:37,540
We'll finish
talking.

1534
01:20:43,952 --> 01:20:46,386
I would have
come over myself,

1535
01:20:46,455 --> 01:20:49,424
but I have trouble
crossing streets
these days.

1536
01:20:49,491 --> 01:20:51,584
Too many
motorcars now.

1537
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,525
Of course.

1538
01:20:55,998 --> 01:20:57,488
I'm sorry to say...

1539
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:01,127
I have regrets
from my son Frank.

1540
01:21:04,306 --> 01:21:08,743
He'll not be able
to keep his dinner
engagement with you.

1541
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:11,643
Frank's
in the hospital.

1542
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:16,083
Dear God,
is he all right?

1543
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:19,086
His injuries,
thank the Lord,
are not serious...

1544
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:22,017
but the consequences
are.

1545
01:21:24,493 --> 01:21:28,293
He was driving
a friend's motorcar...

1546
01:21:29,998 --> 01:21:31,693
while intoxicated.

1547
01:21:34,336 --> 01:21:36,770
He'll have to face
police charges.

1548
01:21:38,006 --> 01:21:39,496
I'm sure of that.

1549
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:44,278
<i>As soon as Frank
can get out...</i>

1550
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:45,779
<i>ofhis difficulties
here,</i>

1551
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:48,782
<i>we've decided to move
upstate New York...</i>

1552
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:51,785
<i>where there's a clinic
that can help him...</i>

1553
01:21:51,853 --> 01:21:53,616
<i>and where
we have relatives...</i>

1554
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:55,623
<i>with whom we can stay.</i>

1555
01:21:57,025 --> 01:21:58,617
Uh, Mrs. Murphy...

1556
01:22:00,028 --> 01:22:03,486
I'm so, uh,
terribly sorry.

1557
01:22:03,565 --> 01:22:08,593
<i>Please tell Frank
that I wish him
only the best.</i>

1558
01:22:21,717 --> 01:22:25,153
It could've been you
in that car with him.

1559
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:28,678
I warned you the first day
about those people.

1560
01:22:28,757 --> 01:22:30,657
<i>Stop calling them
"those people."</i>

1561
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:33,490
She's a mother
like you and me.

1562
01:22:33,562 --> 01:22:35,291
And what is he?

1563
01:22:35,364 --> 01:22:37,059
He's someone
in trouble.

1564
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:39,532
He's someone
who needs help.

1565
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:42,866
For God's sake,
you don't even
know the man.

1566
01:22:42,938 --> 01:22:46,305
I know him. I know
what they're all like.

1567
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:50,344
Who are you to talk?

1568
01:22:50,412 --> 01:22:51,845
Are we any better?

1569
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,847
Are we something
so special?

1570
01:22:53,915 --> 01:22:55,849
We're all poor
around here.

1571
01:22:55,917 --> 01:22:58,181
At least we can
be charitable.

1572
01:22:58,253 --> 01:23:01,188
Why? What can I
afford to give away?

1573
01:23:01,256 --> 01:23:04,692
Did I get you
all dressed up
for nothing?

1574
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,194
Did I get
your hopes up?

1575
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:09,696
I just tried
to help you.

1576
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:13,201
Nobody cares
for their family
more than you do,

1577
01:23:13,268 --> 01:23:15,202
but at least
be sympathetic...

1578
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,204
to someone else
in trouble.

1579
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:19,570
Who should I care about?
Who's watching over me?

1580
01:23:19,641 --> 01:23:22,132
I did enough in
my life for people.

1581
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:24,644
Ooh. You know what
I'm talking about.

1582
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:25,975
No, I don't.

1583
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:27,982
Say what's on your mind.

1584
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,312
What people?

1585
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:30,646
You! Celia! Papa!

1586
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,153
How many beatings
did I get...

1587
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:34,984
for things
that you did?

1588
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:37,821
How many dresses
did I go without...

1589
01:23:37,893 --> 01:23:40,157
so you could look
like somebody?

1590
01:23:40,228 --> 01:23:42,992
I was the workhorse,
you, the pretty one.

1591
01:23:43,065 --> 01:23:46,523
You have no right
to talk to me
like that.

1592
01:23:59,114 --> 01:24:00,376
This is aboutJack.

1593
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:03,213
You're blaming me
for what happened
toJack.

1594
01:24:03,285 --> 01:24:06,083
Why do you think
he's sick today?

1595
01:24:06,154 --> 01:24:09,715
Why did a policeman have to
carry him home at 3 A. M?

1596
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:14,125
So Nora could have dancing lessons?
So Laurie could see a doctor?

1597
01:24:14,196 --> 01:24:15,925
You worry about your friend
across the street,

1598
01:24:15,997 --> 01:24:17,760
not those
being dragged home...

1599
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:20,495
to keep a roof
over your head.

1600
01:24:20,569 --> 01:24:22,469
<i>[Blanche] Why didn't
you tell me...</i>

1601
01:24:22,537 --> 01:24:24,471
<i>how you felt
about this?</i>

1602
01:24:24,539 --> 01:24:28,134
<i>[Kate] I was too busy
taking care of everybody.
[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

1603
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:29,438
<i>[Blanche] My God...</i>

1604
01:24:29,511 --> 01:24:32,674
<i>[Laurie] Shh. Your mother
and my mother are fighting.</i>

1605
01:24:32,748 --> 01:24:34,010
About what?

1606
01:24:34,082 --> 01:24:36,050
Your mother was
the workhorse,

1607
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:38,052
mine was
the pretty one.

1608
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,212
What?

1609
01:24:39,287 --> 01:24:41,050
<i>[Blanche] I'd pack
Nora and Laurie...</i>

1610
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:43,182
out of the house
tonight if I could,

1611
01:24:43,258 --> 01:24:46,853
<i>but I have no place
to take them.</i>

1612
01:24:46,928 --> 01:24:49,829
If they
could stay here
another few weeks,

1613
01:24:49,898 --> 01:24:51,923
I would
appreciate it.

1614
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,025
<i>Until I find a place.</i>

1615
01:24:54,102 --> 01:24:55,933
<i>Then I'll send
for them.</i>

1616
01:24:56,004 --> 01:24:57,767
Blanche,
don't talk like that.

1617
01:24:57,839 --> 01:24:59,101
The ice cream.
Not now!

1618
01:24:59,174 --> 01:25:01,938
I know a woman
in Manhattan Beach...

1619
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:03,773
who I can stay with.

1620
01:25:03,845 --> 01:25:05,608
Then I'll
find a job.

1621
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,944
I'll do anything
anybody asks me,

1622
01:25:08,016 --> 01:25:11,110
but I will never be
a burden to anyone...

1623
01:25:11,186 --> 01:25:13,518
as long as I live.

1624
01:25:13,588 --> 01:25:15,021
Blanche, stop this!

1625
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:18,150
[Sighs]

1626
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:22,162
What the hell
is going on here,
for God's sakes?

1627
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:25,499
Two sisters
having a fight...

1628
01:25:25,567 --> 01:25:27,933
they should've had
25 years ago.

1629
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:30,301
<i>Tell her, Kate,
what it is...</i>

1630
01:25:30,372 --> 01:25:32,135
<i>to be an older sister.</i>

1631
01:25:32,207 --> 01:25:33,504
<i>Call her names, Blanche.</i>

1632
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:35,839
<i>Tell her
to go to hell...</i>

1633
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:37,435
<i>for the first time
in your life.</i>

1634
01:25:37,512 --> 01:25:40,970
When you both get it
out of your system,

1635
01:25:41,049 --> 01:25:44,018
hug each other
and go have dinner.

1636
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:47,282
My lousy ice cream
is melting, for God sakes.

1637
01:25:49,925 --> 01:25:52,860
No matter what
Kate says to me,

1638
01:25:52,928 --> 01:25:55,362
I will never
stop loving her,

1639
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,864
but I have to get out.

1640
01:26:01,269 --> 01:26:03,533
If I don't do it now,

1641
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:06,870
I'll lose what little
self-respect I have left.

1642
01:26:06,942 --> 01:26:08,705
And when I grow old,

1643
01:26:08,777 --> 01:26:11,712
I wish I have
as much self-respect...

1644
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,247
as Mrs. Matthew Murphy.

1645
01:26:20,622 --> 01:26:23,557
Something happened
for you to behave
like this.

1646
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:24,887
It wasn't Blanche.

1647
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,393
It was
something else.

1648
01:26:26,461 --> 01:26:27,621
What?

1649
01:26:30,966 --> 01:26:34,402
Tell the kids we're eating
in the kitchen tonight.

1650
01:26:44,646 --> 01:26:46,671
[Whispers]
Hey, Stan.

1651
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:48,340
[Whispering]
Hey, Stan, did you...

1652
01:27:36,932 --> 01:27:38,456
Stan!

1653
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:41,699
Stanley, wait!

1654
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:49,977
Why are you doing this?

1655
01:27:50,045 --> 01:27:52,980
You always told me
never to run away.

1656
01:27:53,048 --> 01:27:55,482
I'm leaving.
Only kids run away.

1657
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:57,984
Does Pop know
about my salary?

1658
01:27:58,053 --> 01:27:59,987
You told Mom that. Why?

1659
01:28:00,055 --> 01:28:01,989
I had
12 terrific lies.

1660
01:28:02,057 --> 01:28:03,991
I have $1.12 for you.

1661
01:28:04,059 --> 01:28:05,549
It's my life's savings.

1662
01:28:05,627 --> 01:28:06,889
I'll make it okay.

1663
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:08,259
Please, Stan.

1664
01:28:11,066 --> 01:28:12,328
Take the money.

1665
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,662
I'll pay you back.

1666
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:16,499
If there's a war,
I'll become a sergeant.

1667
01:28:16,571 --> 01:28:17,833
They make good dough.

1668
01:28:17,906 --> 01:28:20,670
If it lasts long enough,
I could join.

1669
01:28:20,742 --> 01:28:24,303
Don't go in the army
unless they come get you.

1670
01:28:24,379 --> 01:28:26,847
Promise me
you'll go to college.

1671
01:28:26,915 --> 01:28:28,849
Don't leave, Stan.

1672
01:28:28,917 --> 01:28:30,350
They'll get over it.

1673
01:28:30,418 --> 01:28:33,182
They won't stay mad
at you forever.

1674
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:36,052
I got over
being mad at you.

1675
01:28:36,124 --> 01:28:37,591
I'm nothing but trouble.

1676
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:40,560
Don't turn out
to be like me.

1677
01:28:42,063 --> 01:28:44,998
I don't see what's
so bad about you.

1678
01:28:47,402 --> 01:28:49,495
Take care
of yourself, Euge.

1679
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:01,347
<i>Hey, Euge.</i>

1680
01:29:01,416 --> 01:29:05,182
If you ever write
a story about me,
call me Hank.

1681
01:29:05,253 --> 01:29:07,653
<i>I always liked
the name Hank.</i>

1682
01:29:29,477 --> 01:29:32,913
<i>[Eugene Narrating] I guess there
comes a time in everyone's life...</i>

1683
01:29:32,981 --> 01:29:34,414
<i>when you say,</i>

1684
01:29:34,482 --> 01:29:38,282
<i>"This very moment is
the end of my childhood. "</i>

1685
01:29:39,988 --> 01:29:42,582
<i>When Stanley
got on that train,</i>

1686
01:29:42,657 --> 01:29:45,592
<i>I knew that moment
had come to me,</i>

1687
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,389
<i>and I was scared.</i>

1688
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:50,297
<i>I was lonely...</i>

1689
01:29:51,499 --> 01:29:54,434
<i>and I hated
my mother and father...</i>

1690
01:29:54,502 --> 01:29:56,402
<i>for making him so unhappy.</i>

1691
01:29:56,471 --> 01:29:58,905
<i>I even hated Stanley
a little...</i>

1692
01:29:58,973 --> 01:30:02,909
<i>because he left me there
to grow up by myself.</i>

1693
01:30:15,824 --> 01:30:19,760
<i>I tried to hold out
as long as I could,</i>

1694
01:30:19,828 --> 01:30:22,763
<i>but I knew
they'd find out sometime.</i>

1695
01:30:22,831 --> 01:30:24,765
<i>So I just said it.</i>

1696
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:28,769
<i>I said that Stanley
had left tojoin the army.</i>

1697
01:30:28,837 --> 01:30:30,099
What army?

1698
01:30:31,339 --> 01:30:32,772
The U.S. Army.

1699
01:30:32,841 --> 01:30:34,775
How many armies
are there?

1700
01:30:34,843 --> 01:30:37,812
Never. Not without
talking to me first.

1701
01:30:37,879 --> 01:30:39,005
Ketchup.

1702
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:42,015
I saw him leave
on the train.

1703
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,449
He won't
be back tonight.

1704
01:30:44,519 --> 01:30:47,079
He's walking around
in New York.

1705
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:50,249
He's upset because
we had a fight.

1706
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:53,226
A fight about what?

1707
01:30:56,664 --> 01:30:59,098
A fight about what?

1708
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:00,600
He lost his salary.

1709
01:31:00,668 --> 01:31:02,932
He gambled
in a pool hall.

1710
01:31:03,004 --> 01:31:04,369
He lost the $17.

1711
01:31:06,207 --> 01:31:09,005
He just tried
to make back the money...

1712
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:11,045
Pop lost by not working.

1713
01:31:11,112 --> 01:31:13,637
That's why
he joined the army.

1714
01:31:13,715 --> 01:31:15,649
He should've
talked to me.

1715
01:31:19,254 --> 01:31:20,516
<i>I'm his father!</i>

1716
01:31:20,588 --> 01:31:23,523
<i>What, is he afraid
to talk to me?</i>

1717
01:31:23,591 --> 01:31:28,221
<i>[Kate] He loves you so much
he didn't want to tell you.</i>

1718
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:31,164
<i>[Eugene Narrating]
From the sound of it,</i>

1719
01:31:31,232 --> 01:31:34,167
<i>I figured Stanley should
forget about the army...</i>

1720
01:31:34,235 --> 01:31:36,169
<i>andjoin
the Foreign Legion.</i>

1721
01:31:56,257 --> 01:31:59,249
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

1722
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,193
I wanted to talk to you.

1723
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:11,497
How was your dinner?

1724
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:15,304
I didn't go.
Mr. Murphy was
in an accident.

1725
01:32:15,376 --> 01:32:16,741
I'm sorry.

1726
01:32:16,811 --> 01:32:18,176
Is he all right?

1727
01:32:18,246 --> 01:32:19,770
<i>He has his problems,</i>

1728
01:32:19,848 --> 01:32:21,907
like the rest of us.

1729
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:34,487
I was very upset
that you left tonight...

1730
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:35,824
without saying good-bye.

1731
01:32:35,897 --> 01:32:38,229
You have never
done that before.

1732
01:32:38,299 --> 01:32:40,199
Could we talk about this
in the morning?

1733
01:32:40,268 --> 01:32:42,964
I'm leaving, Nora.
I'm moving out
in the morning.

1734
01:32:43,037 --> 01:32:45,904
What are you talking about?

1735
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:49,777
Aunt Kate and I
had a fight.

1736
01:32:49,844 --> 01:32:53,245
We said some terrible
things to each other.

1737
01:32:53,314 --> 01:32:55,805
I'm going to stay
with my friend Louise...

1738
01:32:55,884 --> 01:32:57,181
in Manhattan Beach...

1739
01:32:57,252 --> 01:32:59,083
until I find work.

1740
01:32:59,153 --> 01:33:02,316
<i>Then I'll send
for you and Laurie.</i>

1741
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:03,914
I can't believe it.

1742
01:33:07,662 --> 01:33:10,927
You mean it's okay
for you to leave us,

1743
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:12,899
but not for me
to leave you?

1744
01:33:12,967 --> 01:33:16,368
I wasn't concerned
about your leaving.

1745
01:33:16,437 --> 01:33:18,769
It's your future
I was worrying about.

1746
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,775
So I have to give up
the one chance...

1747
01:33:21,843 --> 01:33:24,277
I may never get again.

1748
01:33:24,345 --> 01:33:26,905
<i>I have to pay
for what you couldn't do...</i>

1749
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:28,346
<i>with your own life?</i>

1750
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:32,147
What right do you have
to judge me like that?

1751
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,051
<i>Judge you?</i>

1752
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:36,249
I can't even talk to you.

1753
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:38,155
I don't exist to you.

1754
01:33:38,226 --> 01:33:40,786
I've tried
to get close to you,

1755
01:33:40,862 --> 01:33:42,693
but there was never room.

1756
01:33:42,764 --> 01:33:45,460
Whatever you had to give
was Daddy's.

1757
01:33:45,533 --> 01:33:49,833
When he died, whatever
was left you gave to...

1758
01:33:49,904 --> 01:33:52,873
Finish what you
were going to say.

1759
01:33:52,941 --> 01:33:55,569
I've been jealous
my whole life of Laurie.

1760
01:33:55,643 --> 01:33:58,771
She was lucky enough
to be born sick!

1761
01:33:58,846 --> 01:34:01,280
<i>I prayed I'd get
some terrible disease...</i>

1762
01:34:01,349 --> 01:34:03,510
or get hit by a car...

1763
01:34:03,584 --> 01:34:07,020
so I'd have a leg
all twisted and crippled.

1764
01:34:07,088 --> 01:34:08,453
Then once, just once,

1765
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:11,458
I could crawl
into bed with you...

1766
01:34:11,526 --> 01:34:12,959
on a cold, rainy night...

1767
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:15,461
and talk to you,
hold you,

1768
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:18,363
until I fell asleep
in your arms.

1769
01:34:18,433 --> 01:34:20,560
Just once.

1770
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:28,667
My God, Nora.

1771
01:34:31,746 --> 01:34:35,079
Is that what you
think of me?

1772
01:34:35,149 --> 01:34:38,846
Is it any worse than
what you think of me?

1773
01:34:40,088 --> 01:34:43,353
<i>I am not going
to let you hurt me!</i>

1774
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:45,984
I'm not going to be
a doormat...

1775
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,426
for all the frustrations
and unhappiness...

1776
01:34:48,496 --> 01:34:51,294
that you or Aunt Kate
or anyone else...

1777
01:34:51,366 --> 01:34:53,357
wants to lay at my feet.

1778
01:34:54,435 --> 01:34:56,801
I did not
create this universe.

1779
01:34:56,871 --> 01:34:59,669
I do not decide
who lives or dies,

1780
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:01,572
or who's rich or poor,

1781
01:35:01,642 --> 01:35:04,440
or who feels loved
and who feels deprived.

1782
01:35:04,512 --> 01:35:07,310
If you feel cheated
that Laurie gets more,

1783
01:35:07,382 --> 01:35:10,715
I feel cheated that
my husband died at 36!

1784
01:35:10,785 --> 01:35:13,310
I'm sorry that you
feel unloved, Nora,

1785
01:35:13,388 --> 01:35:16,824
and I'll do everything
I can to change it,

1786
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:19,519
<i>but I will not
go back to being...</i>

1787
01:35:19,594 --> 01:35:21,027
<i>that frightened,
helpless woman...</i>

1788
01:35:21,095 --> 01:35:23,791
<i>that I created.</i>

1789
01:35:28,302 --> 01:35:30,668
I already buried
someone I love.

1790
01:35:30,738 --> 01:35:34,105
Now it's time to bury
someone I hate.

1791
01:36:02,503 --> 01:36:04,869
<i>You belong
to Uncle Sam now.</i>

1792
01:36:04,939 --> 01:36:07,430
You'll hear from us
in three weeks.

1793
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:13,571
Don't look
so worried, son.

1794
01:36:13,648 --> 01:36:15,673
<i>We'll make you
into a man.</i>

1795
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:17,274
I'll carry my load.

1796
01:36:17,351 --> 01:36:19,751
Okay, soldier. Sign here.

1797
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,953
<i>Something wrong?</i>

1798
01:36:28,029 --> 01:36:29,462
What?

1799
01:36:42,543 --> 01:36:44,272
Well, I'm going.

1800
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,478
I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

1801
01:36:48,549 --> 01:36:49,982
Blanche.

1802
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:52,644
Don't go.

1803
01:36:54,722 --> 01:36:57,657
I feel bad enough
for what I said.

1804
01:36:57,725 --> 01:37:00,319
Don't make me feel
any worse.

1805
01:37:00,394 --> 01:37:02,225
As God is in heaven,

1806
01:37:02,296 --> 01:37:04,856
there will never be
an angry word...

1807
01:37:04,932 --> 01:37:06,763
between you and me again,
Kate,

1808
01:37:06,834 --> 01:37:09,394
but I'm afraid of
being comfortable here.

1809
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:12,337
If I don't go now,
when will I?

1810
01:37:12,406 --> 01:37:15,705
The door is open.
Go whenever you want.

1811
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,539
Get a job first.

1812
01:37:17,612 --> 01:37:20,012
Get your apartment
first.

1813
01:37:20,081 --> 01:37:22,675
I'll find out about
the Murphy place.

1814
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:24,115
Couldn't be
very expensive.

1815
01:37:24,185 --> 01:37:25,812
She never cleaned it.

1816
01:37:25,887 --> 01:37:28,014
How independent
can I become...

1817
01:37:28,089 --> 01:37:31,855
if I live right across
the street from you?

1818
01:37:31,926 --> 01:37:35,692
Far enough away for you
to close your own door.

1819
01:37:35,763 --> 01:37:39,130
Close enough for me
not to feel so lonely.

1820
01:37:40,668 --> 01:37:45,469
[Eugene] Okay. 29 to 7.
Let's go! Come on!

1821
01:37:47,675 --> 01:37:50,007
Come on, Tony!
Make him hit it!

1822
01:37:50,945 --> 01:37:52,378
<i>Do better in there.</i>

1823
01:37:53,548 --> 01:37:55,846
<i>[Boy] I got it! I got it!</i>

1824
01:37:57,451 --> 01:37:58,713
Stan!

1825
01:37:58,786 --> 01:37:59,878
Hi.

1826
01:37:59,954 --> 01:38:01,216
Well, what happened?

1827
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:02,654
Did you join up?

1828
01:38:02,723 --> 01:38:04,088
I came pretty close.

1829
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:05,523
I passed the physical,
one-two-three.

1830
01:38:05,593 --> 01:38:06,958
I knew you would.

1831
01:38:07,028 --> 01:38:09,394
As I was about to sign,

1832
01:38:09,463 --> 01:38:11,328
I stopped cold
and walked out.

1833
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:12,491
How come?

1834
01:38:12,567 --> 01:38:15,058
Couldn't do it to Pop.

1835
01:38:15,136 --> 01:38:19,072
Right now he needs me
more than the army does.

1836
01:38:21,209 --> 01:38:24,645
I thought you'd be
at training camp by now,

1837
01:38:24,712 --> 01:38:27,237
but I'm real glad
you're home, Stan.

1838
01:38:34,655 --> 01:38:35,917
<i>Hi, Ma.</i>

1839
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,422
Stanley's home.

1840
01:38:43,497 --> 01:38:44,862
Go back to Greenblatt's.

1841
01:38:44,932 --> 01:38:47,765
I need sweet cream
and some more sugar.

1842
01:38:47,835 --> 01:38:49,166
Get a 2-pound bag.

1843
01:38:49,237 --> 01:38:51,671
I want to make
a chocolate cake.

1844
01:38:51,739 --> 01:38:54,105
A 2-pound bag
from Greenblatt's?

1845
01:38:54,175 --> 01:38:56,268
I'll need
identification.

1846
01:38:58,346 --> 01:38:59,904
How are you, Ma?

1847
01:39:00,815 --> 01:39:02,612
Are you staying
for dinner?

1848
01:39:02,683 --> 01:39:06,084
I'm staying as long
as you'll let me.

1849
01:39:06,153 --> 01:39:07,814
Why shouldn't I let you?

1850
01:39:07,888 --> 01:39:09,446
This is your home.

1851
01:39:10,524 --> 01:39:12,389
Your father's been
very worried.

1852
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:15,122
I think you owe him
an explanation.

1853
01:39:18,332 --> 01:39:21,631
<i>[Announcer] Acrid, yellowish smoke
billowed yesterday...</i>

1854
01:39:21,702 --> 01:39:23,795
<i>around
the Hindenburg Palace.</i>

1855
01:39:23,871 --> 01:39:26,704
<i>Bombing planes,
chased by pursuit ships,</i>

1856
01:39:26,774 --> 01:39:28,799
<i>streaked across the sky...</i>

1857
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:31,538
<i>as Adolf Hitler
prepared for a visit...</i>

1858
01:39:31,612 --> 01:39:33,807
<i>by Benito Mussolini.</i>

1859
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:36,315
<i>Their fascist-Nazi mission,
they proclaim...</i>

1860
01:39:36,384 --> 01:39:38,818
Hi, Pop.
How you feeling?

1861
01:39:38,886 --> 01:39:40,979
<i>[Announcer Continues]
... Communism indications were...</i>

1862
01:39:41,055 --> 01:39:44,320
<i>that neither Mussolini
nor Hitler wanted to...</i>

1863
01:39:45,726 --> 01:39:48,820
I'm sorry about
not coming home last night.

1864
01:39:50,064 --> 01:39:51,895
I just didn't know how...

1865
01:39:51,966 --> 01:39:54,560
to tell you
about the money.

1866
01:39:56,637 --> 01:39:58,628
[Sighs]

1867
01:39:58,706 --> 01:39:59,900
Don't you know, Stanley,

1868
01:39:59,974 --> 01:40:02,340
there's nothing
you could ever do...

1869
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:05,004
that was so terrible
I couldn't forgive you?

1870
01:40:05,079 --> 01:40:07,570
<i>I know why you gambled.</i>

1871
01:40:07,648 --> 01:40:10,014
<i>I know how miserable
you feel.</i>

1872
01:40:10,084 --> 01:40:13,520
<i>I lost money gambling.
I know what it's like.</i>

1873
01:40:13,587 --> 01:40:14,918
You did?

1874
01:40:14,989 --> 01:40:16,013
You're so surprised?

1875
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,888
You think your father's
a perfect human being?

1876
01:40:18,959 --> 01:40:21,757
You go through life
thinking I was perfect,

1877
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:24,627
you'll hate yourself for
every mistake you make.

1878
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:27,031
Don't be
so hard on yourself.

1879
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:29,035
You're a good son,
Stanley.

1880
01:40:30,104 --> 01:40:31,469
I gambled away $17,

1881
01:40:31,539 --> 01:40:34,474
and you're telling me
how terrific I am.

1882
01:40:34,542 --> 01:40:35,702
Hey, wait a minute.

1883
01:40:35,776 --> 01:40:37,641
Don't get
the wrong idea.

1884
01:40:37,712 --> 01:40:40,044
If you were home
last night,

1885
01:40:40,114 --> 01:40:43,880
I would've thrown
you and your clothes
out the window.

1886
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:46,381
Today I'm calmer.

1887
01:40:46,454 --> 01:40:48,649
Today I heard
the radio.

1888
01:40:48,723 --> 01:40:51,851
Today I'm afraid
for all of us.

1889
01:40:52,727 --> 01:40:54,558
I understand.

1890
01:40:55,463 --> 01:40:57,556
All right.

1891
01:40:58,432 --> 01:41:01,162
<i>After lunch, apologize
to your mother,</i>

1892
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:03,066
<i>and apologize
to Aunt Blanche...</i>

1893
01:41:03,137 --> 01:41:04,502
<i>because she
was worried, too.</i>

1894
01:41:04,572 --> 01:41:05,732
<i>[Stanley] I will.</i>

1895
01:41:05,806 --> 01:41:07,671
Thank your brother, too.

1896
01:41:07,742 --> 01:41:11,405
He came into my bedroom
and explained how you felt.

1897
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:13,276
The way he pleaded your case,

1898
01:41:13,347 --> 01:41:15,815
I thought I had
Clarence Darrow in the room.

1899
01:41:15,883 --> 01:41:17,874
<i>[Kate] Are you
coming to eat?</i>

1900
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,385
Lunch is getting cold.

1901
01:41:19,453 --> 01:41:23,253
<i>I want to wash up.
Can I talk to you
after lunch, Mom?</i>

1902
01:41:23,324 --> 01:41:25,758
Where am I going,
to a nightclub?

1903
01:41:31,499 --> 01:41:33,296
It's all right!

1904
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:34,766
Everything
is all right!

1905
01:41:34,835 --> 01:41:36,200
Who said it wasn't?

1906
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:39,239
Didn't I say
he'd be home?

1907
01:41:55,156 --> 01:41:57,590
4 minutes, 22 seconds.

1908
01:41:57,658 --> 01:42:01,526
An Olympic record for
going to Greenblatt's.

1909
01:42:04,498 --> 01:42:06,591
Where's Stanley?

1910
01:42:06,667 --> 01:42:08,294
Upstairs.

1911
01:42:09,703 --> 01:42:12,638
Here's some mail
for you, Pop.

1912
01:42:12,706 --> 01:42:16,403
My God! He ate
11/2 pounds
of sugar!

1913
01:42:19,814 --> 01:42:22,715
Hear you're back
in the family.

1914
01:42:22,783 --> 01:42:23,875
<i>Everything's great.</i>

1915
01:42:23,951 --> 01:42:26,749
<i>Pop told me
you stuck up for me.</i>

1916
01:42:26,821 --> 01:42:28,914
Yeah. I was brilliant.

1917
01:42:28,989 --> 01:42:30,217
To show
my appreciation...

1918
01:42:30,291 --> 01:42:32,486
I brought you
a present.

1919
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,993
What kind of present?

1920
01:42:34,061 --> 01:42:36,427
<i>Promise you'll keep it
someplace safe.</i>

1921
01:42:36,497 --> 01:42:37,896
I will. I will!

1922
01:42:37,965 --> 01:42:39,193
What's my present?

1923
01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:41,598
Here. Use it
in good health.

1924
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:42,931
What is it?

1925
01:42:43,003 --> 01:42:44,265
Close your eyes!

1926
01:42:47,741 --> 01:42:49,504
Now look.

1927
01:42:51,579 --> 01:42:53,342
Oh, my God!

1928
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:02,021
She's naked.

1929
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,251
You can see everything.

1930
01:43:09,330 --> 01:43:12,026
Don't get caught
with a thing like that.

1931
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:14,533
<i>Who is she?</i>

1932
01:43:14,602 --> 01:43:15,694
She's French.

1933
01:43:15,769 --> 01:43:18,636
That's how all
the women are in Paris.

1934
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:23,676
You mean some girl
actually posed for this?

1935
01:43:23,744 --> 01:43:27,874
She just laid there and
let some guy take a picture?

1936
01:43:27,948 --> 01:43:31,008
It belongs to the guy
who owes me $2.50.

1937
01:43:31,085 --> 01:43:33,451
It's mine
until he pays me.

1938
01:43:33,521 --> 01:43:36,354
Don't take the money.
Let him owe you.

1939
01:43:36,423 --> 01:43:38,618
Put it in a safe spot.

1940
01:43:39,426 --> 01:43:40,859
<i>Come on. It's lunch.</i>

1941
01:43:42,096 --> 01:43:43,688
In a minute.

1942
01:43:45,799 --> 01:43:48,233
I'll be down
in a minute.

1943
01:43:50,571 --> 01:43:52,971
<i>[Kate] I got more
for who wants it.</i>

1944
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,302
Ta-da!

1945
01:43:54,375 --> 01:44:00,075
Oh! I'm so glad to
see you home, Stanley!

1946
01:44:00,147 --> 01:44:02,479
I was so worried
about you.

1947
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:05,713
I'm glad to see you here,
too, Aunt Blanche.

1948
01:44:05,786 --> 01:44:06,912
Oh!

1949
01:44:08,989 --> 01:44:10,183
Hi, Stan!

1950
01:44:10,257 --> 01:44:12,088
Hey, squirt!
Got your nose!

1951
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,922
You're so funny.

1952
01:44:18,165 --> 01:44:19,598
Oh, God!

1953
01:44:19,667 --> 01:44:20,929
Oh, my God!

1954
01:44:21,001 --> 01:44:22,263
<i>What is it?</i>

1955
01:44:22,336 --> 01:44:24,099
What's wrong, Jack?

1956
01:44:24,171 --> 01:44:26,071
It's a letter from London.

1957
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:27,971
My cousin Sholem got out.

1958
01:44:28,042 --> 01:44:29,907
They got out of Poland.

1959
01:44:29,977 --> 01:44:31,239
They're free, Kate.

1960
01:44:31,312 --> 01:44:32,609
Oh, thank God!

1961
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:35,274
His wife, his mother,
all six children.

1962
01:44:35,349 --> 01:44:37,715
They're sailing for
New York tomorrow.

1963
01:44:37,785 --> 01:44:40,151
They'll be here
in a week.

1964
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,619
Do they
speak English?

1965
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:44,021
I don't think so.
A few words, maybe.

1966
01:44:44,091 --> 01:44:45,888
Somebody wrote
this for him.

1967
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,393
They had to sell
everything.

1968
01:44:47,461 --> 01:44:49,793
They took what
they could carry.

1969
01:44:49,863 --> 01:44:51,262
Where will
they stay?

1970
01:44:51,332 --> 01:44:54,096
Well, I'll have to
discuss it with the family.

1971
01:44:54,168 --> 01:44:55,533
Some with Uncle Sol.

1972
01:44:55,603 --> 01:44:56,968
Uncle Eddie.
With us.

1973
01:44:57,037 --> 01:44:59,562
We'll put beds
in the dining room.

1974
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,938
I like eating
in the kitchen.

1975
01:45:02,009 --> 01:45:04,341
The kids could
stay with Laurie.

1976
01:45:04,411 --> 01:45:06,743
Nora can sleep
with me, right?

1977
01:45:06,814 --> 01:45:07,746
Of course!

1978
01:45:07,815 --> 01:45:09,214
Don't worry
about money, Pa.

1979
01:45:09,283 --> 01:45:11,114
I'll hit Mr. Stroheim
for that raise.

1980
01:45:11,185 --> 01:45:13,551
They got out!
That's all that's important.

1981
01:45:13,621 --> 01:45:14,883
They got out!

1982
01:45:14,955 --> 01:45:16,320
Where's that boy again?

1983
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:19,120
Eugene! We're all
waiting for you!

1984
01:45:20,194 --> 01:45:21,286
<i>Be right there!</i>

1985
01:45:21,362 --> 01:45:23,296
<i>I'm doing something!</i>

1986
01:45:26,233 --> 01:45:29,828
[Eugene Thinking]
October the 2nd, 1937,

1987
01:45:29,903 --> 01:45:31,495
an historic moment...

1988
01:45:31,572 --> 01:45:35,269
in the life
of Eugene Morris Jerome.

1989
01:45:35,342 --> 01:45:38,004
<i>I havejust seen...</i>

1990
01:45:38,078 --> 01:45:41,514
<i>the golden palace
of the Himalayas!</i>

1991
01:45:41,582 --> 01:45:44,676
<i>Puberty is over!</i>

1992
01:45:44,752 --> 01:45:48,153
<i>Onwards and upwards!</i>
