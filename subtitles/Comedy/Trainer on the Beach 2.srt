1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,860
My name is Richard.

2
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,220
So what else
do you need to know..

3
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,100
stuff about my family
or where I'm from?

4
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,660
None of that matters..

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,780
not once you cross the ocean
and cut your self loose

6
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,060
looking for something
more beautiful,

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,020
something more exciting..

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,580
and, yes, I admit..

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,100
something more dangerous.

10
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,420
So after 18 hours
in the back of an airplane,

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,980
3 dumb movies,
2 plastic meals, 6 beers,

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,820
and absolutely no sleep..

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,260
I finally touched down..

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,260
Hey, you!
How about you?

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,220
In Bangkok.

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,340
Want to go to
the waterfall?

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,580
Come on!
Floating market!

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,060
1,500!
Cheap for you!

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,100
Come on! Hey!

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,260
Hey, you need
somewhere to stay?

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,380
No. I'll be fine.

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,500
I'll find my own place.
Thanks.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,580
What do you want,
man?

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,540
And this is it..

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,180
Bangkok:

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,780
good-time city,

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,860
gateway to southeast Asia,

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,620
where dollars
and deutschmarks

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,500
get turned into
counterfeit watches

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,980
and genuine scars.

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,940
Good time!

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,380
Boy, girl, fucking.
No problem.

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,300
This is where the hungry
come to feed.

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,180
You want to drink
snake blood?

35
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,180
Wait a minute.

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,260
Did you say snake blood?

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,340
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,100
No, thanks.

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,660
What is wrong
with snake blood?

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,780
I just don't like the idea.

41
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,620
Oh, maybe
you're scared.

42
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,780
Afraid of somethin' new?

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,820
No. I just don't like
the idea, that's all.

44
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
Ha! Like every tourist..

45
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,580
you want it all be safe,
just like America.

46
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,540
Richard: So never
refuse an invitation.

47
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,740
Never resist the unfamiliar.

48
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,740
Uhh!

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Never fail
to be polite..

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,100
Gentlemen..

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,860
that was excellent.

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,740
And never
out stay your welcome.

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,900
Just keep your mind open
and suck in the experience,

54
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,900
and if it hurts..

55
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,460
it's probably worth it.

56
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,620
Hey.

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,660
Good evening.

58
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,700
Hi.

59
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,900
Can I get a room, please?

60
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,860
Yes.

61
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,020
Man: Roger. They need
some napalm down there

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
at tree line.

63
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,020
Can you try
and put it down there?

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Richard: The only downer

65
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,260
is everyone's
got the same idea.

66
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,180
We all travel thousands
of miles just to watch TV

67
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,220
and check into somewhere
with all the comforts of home.

68
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,540
And you gotta
ask yourself..

69
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,620
Don't worry, man!

70
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,780
We'll have this place
cleaned up and ready

71
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,380
for us in a jiffy,
so don't you worry!

72
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,380
What is the point of that?

73
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,060
Ahem!

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,820
Et voila.

75
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,780
Thank you.

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,220
Bonsoir.

77
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,860
Bonsoir.

78
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,460
Good night.

79
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,580
And as for traveling alone,

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,740
fuck it.

81
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,140
If that's the way
it has to be,

82
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,900
then that's the way it is.

83
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,740
Everybody happy!

84
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Man: Everybody havin'
a good time, eh?

85
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,140
Fuckyou!

86
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,260
Fuckyou!

87
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,060
Woman: Please
shut up, okay?

88
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,980
Bastard parasites!

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,940
Parasites!

90
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,980
Yeah. That's fucking great!

91
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,140
Cancers! Bastard cancers!

92
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,140
Whoo..

93
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,180
Waah!

94
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,140
Woman: Ah!

95
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,580
Man: Waah!

96
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,100
The big, chunky charlie

97
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,780
is eatin' up
the whole fuckin' world!

98
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,820
Man: Hey!

99
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,300
Hey, you!

100
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,460
You got anything
to smoke?

101
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,500
No, I don't have
anything to smoke.

102
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,300
That's no problem,
pal, 'cause, uh..

103
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,540
I've got loads
of the fucking stuff.

104
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,460
Oh!

105
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,980
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

106
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
Yeah.

107
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,340
No, you don't.

108
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,940
No, you're right.
I don't.

109
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,500
Ah!

110
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,300
That's better!

111
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,420
Thanks.

112
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,500
It was the beach..

113
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,100
you understand?

114
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,700
The beach?

115
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,660
It was too..

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,500
beautiful, too much input,
too much.. sensation.

117
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,740
I tried to keep it
under control,

118
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,940
but it just
keeps spilling out

119
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,420
and spilling out
and spilling out.

120
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,020
Right.

121
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,420
You see, um..

122
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,620
she's on an island..

123
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,780
and that island is..

124
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,980
is perfect. I mean..

125
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,780
I mean real perfection,
you know?

126
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm not just talkin' about..

127
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,100
"Oh, that's nice."

128
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,620
it's the real
fucking deal, okay?

129
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,980
Perfect.

130
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,900
It's just like a..
a lagoon, you know,

131
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,540
A tidal lagoon

132
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,500
that's sealed in
by cliffs,

133
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,420
totally fuckin' secret,
totally fuckin'..

134
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,340
forbidden.

135
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,180
And nobody can ever,
ever, ever, ever go there.

136
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,100
Ever.

137
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,540
But a few people went..

138
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,780
once upon a time..

139
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,540
men and women with ideals,

140
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,820
you understand?

141
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,300
I'm not just talkin'
about the usual travelin',

142
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,060
fucking wanks.

143
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Do you believe
in that place?

144
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,500
No.

145
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,020
But I guess
you're gonna tell me

146
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,540
that I should, right?

147
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,340
It doesn't even fucking matter
what I think anymore.

148
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,300
It's up toyou.

149
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,860
Ideals, eh?

150
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,180
We were just
fucking parasites!

151
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,540
The big, chunky charlie!

152
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,100
See, I was the one that
was tryin' to find the cure.

153
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,100
Procurer of the cure.

154
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,580
And I said to them,
"You've got to leave.

155
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,300
You've got to leave
this place."

156
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,860
But they wouldn't listen.

157
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,300
No offense and all,

158
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
but..

159
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,180
you're fucked
in the head, right?

160
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,900
There, Richard.

161
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,300
It's been nice
knowin' ya, man.

162
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,860
Yeah. You, too.

163
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,900
Be careful!

164
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,860
Electric..
Electricity!

165
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,060
Ma'am!

166
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,020
Ma'am!

167
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Bzzzz!

168
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,220
Chill, man. No worry.

169
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,500
Hey, man,

170
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,580
there is a letter
for you.

171
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,460
A what?

172
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,260
Letter on your door.

173
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,260
No fuckin' way.

174
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,780
Doyou..

175
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,060
Hello?

176
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,940
Richard: You hope..

177
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,180
and you dream.

178
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,380
But you never believe

179
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,980
that something's
gonna happen for you,

180
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,820
not like it does
in the movies.

181
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,780
And when it actually does..

182
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,580
you want it
to feel different..

183
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,380
more visceral..

184
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,780
more real.

185
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,500
I was waiting for it
to hit me..

186
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,860
but it just wouldn't happen.

187
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,660
A name
of Mr. Daffy Duck.

188
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,620
Birthplace..
Never-Never Land?

189
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,900
Gonna fuck up
all the paperwork.

190
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,420
The police were pissed

191
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,460
because he was traveling
under a false passport.

192
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,980
Go ahead.
Sign the statement.

193
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,460
It's okay.

194
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,540
It just say
he cut his wrists,

195
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,580
already dead
when you found him.

196
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
But they didn't ask me
about the map, so..

197
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,460
No problem.

198
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,340
I didn't tell 'em.

199
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,020
You have a nice day.

200
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,980
Good luck.

201
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,020
Excuse me.

202
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,380
Look, I mean..

203
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,900
this island may not
actually even exist,

204
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,020
and even if it does,

205
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,620
I don't even know
if we can get there or not.

206
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,820
I just wondered if you
wanted to come with me.

207
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
That's all.

208
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,980
Hey, you wanna take a hike?

209
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,820
Uh, a trip, a journey..

210
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,540
with your girlfriend

211
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,540
and me?

212
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,860
I mean, the two of you
and me, together?

213
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,220
I'm talking about
the secret island.

214
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,220
I just feel like everyone

216
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
tries to do
somethin' different,

217
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,300
but you always wind up
doin' the same damn thing.

218
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,620
I realized that I
had absolutely no idea

219
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,020
of how I was
gonna get there.

220
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,660
But Etienne..

221
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,580
and I have to hand it
to the guy..

222
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,100
was great.

223
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,900
I mean, he organized
the whole thing:

224
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,540
tickets, timetables,
the whole damn trip..

225
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,460
Bangkok to Surat Thani,

226
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,140
Surat Thani to Na Thon,

227
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
Na Thon to Chawang..

228
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,540
500 miles in 24 hours

229
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,740
at less than 400 baht.

230
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,620
Trust me, it's a very good deal.

231
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,620
We were headed
for the great unknown,

232
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,020
but to get there,

233
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,660
we had to follow
the regular tourist trail.

234
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,740
We are fine.
It's arranged.

235
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,100
Tomorrow morning.

236
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,140
1,800 baht.

237
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,020
Oh, great, man.
Nice work.

238
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,020
There's one problem.

239
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,980
He will not take us
to the island.

240
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,340
It's in
the National Park,

241
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,540
and it's forbidden
to go there.

242
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,420
But we are allowed
to travel to this one

243
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
to stay for one night.

244
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,700
Yeah, yeah. No.
See, that's the wrong one.

245
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,060
Yeah, I know that.

246
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,100
Right, but how do we
get from there to there?

247
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,220
We swim.

248
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,860
We swim?

249
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,820
Yeah.

250
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,380
We leave our rucksacks
on this island,

251
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,540
and then we swim.

252
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,420
You can swim,
can'tyou, Richard?

253
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,460
Of course I can swim.

254
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,300
So, no problem.

255
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,860
Okay, so how far
is it, though?

256
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,020
I don't know.
One or 2 kilometers?

257
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,460
Cool. Cool.

258
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,660
Not far at all.

259
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,060
Stop it, Richard.
It will be worth it.

260
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,620
An adventure,

261
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,660
and just the 3 of us!

262
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,060
Uh-oh.

263
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,700
"Can you swim?"

264
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,420
Of course I can swim.

265
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,580
"Oh, yeah, I am french,

266
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,620
and I have zee beautiful
girlfriend, too, eh?"

267
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,180
Great!

268
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,420
God damn it!

269
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,860
Locked out, huh?

270
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,700
Yeah.

271
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,900
Lost your key?

272
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,020
Uh-huh.

273
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,580
Bummer.

274
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,820
Yeah, bummer.

275
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,060
Soyou wanna
grab a beer or somethin'?

276
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,420
You're probably better off
without her, anyway, bro.

277
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,900
Sammy, how the fuck
would you know

278
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,340
if he's better off
without her or not?

279
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,420
You've never even met her!

280
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,220
I'm just tryin'
to help the guy

281
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,500
through the dark times.

282
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,340
It's not a problem.

283
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,580
You see, Zeph?

284
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,780
It's not a problem.

285
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,780
Change the fuckin' subject.

286
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,060
All right. Let's talk about
how you spend an hour

287
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,660
in front of the mirror
every day.

288
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,260
Oh, that's nice.
You know this guy?

289
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,420
He likes to wipe his ass
with tree leaves.

290
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,780
He thinks he's some sort
of jungle commando.

291
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,540
- I swear to God.
- Whatever.

292
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,180
Damn. Ha ha ha.

293
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,380
I presume
you know the story

294
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,780
of the Kentucky-fried
mouse.

295
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,900
Yeah.

296
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,940
A woman bites
into a chicken leg,

297
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,900
and it turns out
to be a..

298
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,860
a mouse..

299
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,820
right?

300
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,940
- Right.
- A mouse.

301
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,100
It's an urban myth.

302
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,580
Exactly. it always happened
to a friend of a friend

303
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,340
of someone else.

304
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,340
So?

305
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,780
So, I guess
there's this urban myth

306
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,220
goin' around here
at the moment.

307
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,140
It's about a beach.

308
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,900
Yeah?

309
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,020
Uh-huh.

310
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,140
Huh.

311
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,180
And this beach
is perfect, man.

312
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,260
It's on an island, right?

313
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,220
Hidden from the sea.

314
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,540
Now, imagine, you got..

315
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,780
pure white sand..

316
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,780
crystal-clearwater..

317
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,820
palm trees.

318
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,380
Yeah. With coconuts
and shit.

319
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,820
Yo, tell him
the best part, dawg.

320
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,820
Plus..

321
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,020
enough dope, Richard,

322
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,620
to smoke all day
every day

323
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,820
for the rest of
your goddamn life!

324
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,500
Yeah! Mad weed!

325
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,820
There's only a few people

326
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,420
who know
exactly where it is,

327
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,660
and they keep it
absolutely secret.

328
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Of course, no one's actually
ever met any of these people,

329
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,300
only met somebody who has.
You know what I mean?

330
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,700
Exactly. it's
a Kentucky-fried mouse.

331
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,700
Hmm.

332
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,940
Although, I must say,

333
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,540
ifi had a key
to a place like that,

334
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,020
I'd keep it to myself,

335
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,020
'cause you don't want
every fucking asshole

336
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,340
in Thailand turnin' up.

337
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,420
Boop-boo!

338
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,540
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,460
So what do you think
about that story, Richard?

340
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,780
It's good.

341
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,380
It's a good story.

342
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,580
- Hey, you!
- Sammy: Jesus.

343
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,140
I got your key!

344
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,380
Richard: Now, I know it wasn't
a part of the plan,

345
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,580
but I made a decision
to leave a copy of the map.

346
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,060
I'm not gonna say it was
the best decision I ever made.

347
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,860
I told myself
that spreading news

348
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,740
was a part
of a traveler's nature,

349
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,140
but if I was being
completely honest,

350
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,740
I was just like
everybody else..

351
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,620
shit-scared
of the great unknown..

352
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,980
desperate to take
a little piece of home with me.

353
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,820
Etienne: Richard!

354
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,260
Are you ready?

355
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,380
Yeah, yeah. I'm comin'.

356
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,460
Let's go.

357
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,900
Francoise?

358
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,860
Shht!

359
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,540
Etienne will be angry
if I wake him.

360
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,780
He thinks I waste time

361
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,740
taking photographs
of the sky.

362
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,740
Oh, God.

363
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,060
I think so, too.

364
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,140
Yeah?

365
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,380
Have a look.

366
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,860
One night, I will get
the perfect photograph.

367
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,700
Hi.

368
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,140
Whoa! Ha ha ha!

369
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
You realize that..

370
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,180
in the eternity of space..

371
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,060
there's probably a planet
out there, right..

372
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,900
just like this one..

373
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,900
where another you

374
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,020
is photographing
back down towards us.

375
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,580
I mean, essentially,
you are photographing yourself

376
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,900
in a parallel universe.

377
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,540
Incredible.

378
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,180
Yeah.

379
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,700
I mean, there are
infinite worlds out there,

380
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,660
you know?

381
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,860
Where anything
you want to happen..

382
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,140
does happen.

383
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,820
Richard,
you know something?

384
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,940
Hmm?

385
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,260
This is just the kind
of pretentious bullshit

386
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,460
that Americans always
say to French girls

387
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,540
so they can sleep
with them.

388
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,260
Oh, God..

389
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,380
sorry.

390
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,300
I thought
I was doin' pretty good.

391
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,980
It's just the sky,
Richard.

392
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,980
Let's try.

393
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,260
Yeah.

394
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,700
Idiot.

395
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,140
Un, deux, trois..

396
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,340
quatre.

397
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,500
Richard: When you develop
an infatuation for someone,

398
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,740
you always find
a reason to believe

399
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,500
that this is exactly
the person for you.

400
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,860
It doesn't need
to be a good reason.

401
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,380
Taking photographs of
the night sky, for example.

402
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,140
Now, in the long run,

403
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,580
that's just the kind
of dumb, irritating habit

404
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,460
that would cause you
to split up.

405
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,700
But in the haze of infatuation,

406
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,180
it's just what you've been
searching for all theseyears.

407
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,900
One kilometer.

408
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,340
2.

409
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,540
Richard?

410
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,380
I don't know. I'm American.

411
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,340
So?

412
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,660
I think in miles,
not kilometers.

413
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,860
Okay, so
how many miles

414
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,980
do you think
it is?

415
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,540
I don't know, but it
looks like a long way away.

416
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,140
If it's too far,
we're gonna drown.

417
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,980
But if we don't try, then
we'll never know, right?

418
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,700
Right.

419
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,780
So let's go.

420
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,700
Whoo!

421
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,980
You guys all right?

422
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,940
Yeah. We're okay.

423
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,860
Yeah.

424
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,020
I think we're about halfway.

425
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,300
Oh, fuck!

426
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Richard!

427
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,580
Fuck!

428
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,060
What?

429
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,820
I saw a fin.

430
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,700
What? Are you joking?

431
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,740
No, no, no!

432
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,340
A fin.

433
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,820
Okay, a shark fin?

434
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,380
I don't know.
Just a fin

435
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,620
over there,
about 100 meters.

436
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,300
Well, was it big?

437
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,860
Yes.

438
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,700
Well, what the fuck
do you expect me

439
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,020
to do about it?

440
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,580
Nothing. I just thought
you should know!

441
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,780
Well, to be honest, Etienne,

442
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,820
I'd rather
you hadn't told me!

443
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,820
Okay, I'm sorry.

444
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,740
It's a bit fucking
late now, isn't it?

445
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
Francoise!

446
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Francoise!

447
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,700
She's gone!

448
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,340
Oh, my God!

449
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,460
Oh, my God!
Okay, what happened?

450
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,580
I don't know.

451
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,140
She just
went underwater!

452
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,620
She was pulled under!

453
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,020
Francoise!

454
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,820
Where did you go?
Francoise!

455
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,980
I don't see her!

456
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,700
Oh, fuck! it's her bag!

457
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,020
Okay, was there a shark?

458
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,300
Did you see a shark,
Etienne?

459
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,700
I don't know!

460
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,060
I don't know!

461
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,180
Oh, fuck.

462
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,540
Oh, fuck, man.

463
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,660
Aah!

464
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,580
Aah!

465
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,420
Aah! Oh!

466
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,100
Ha ha ha!

467
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,660
Oh, fuck you! Oh!

468
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,660
Ha ha ha.

469
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
Ah ha ha ha ha.

470
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Ah ha ha ha ha.

471
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,940
Oh ho-ho, yeah!

472
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,340
Oh, you Europeans
are so funny, huh?

473
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,380
You have such
a playful sense of humor.

474
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,340
No wonderyour comedies
conquered the world.

475
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,100
Ha ha!
What about Molière?

476
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,300
Who?

477
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,220
Oh, fuck off.

478
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,860
Come on.

479
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,100
Etienne: Wow.

480
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,780
Oh. Now, this is what
I call a lot of dope.

481
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,220
Huh.

482
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,940
Hey.

483
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,420
We're gonna go this way.

484
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,740
Okay? Shut up. Shut up.

485
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,380
Come on.

486
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,500
Aah.

487
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,140
Ay.

488
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,740
Richard: Sure,
we should've turned back,

489
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,100
but I wasn't going to,

490
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,980
not now.

491
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,340
I just kept telling them
we'd get there.

492
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,340
Trust me.

493
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,740
It's paradise.

494
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,340
If we take this down,

495
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,260
it should lead us
all the way.

496
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,940
Come on.

497
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,540
Etienne: Fuck.

498
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,820
Richard: Oh, God.

499
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,580
Merde.

500
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,340
Etienne: Well?

501
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,300
Richard: Well, what?

502
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,580
How do we get down?

503
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,980
How do we get down?

504
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,220
How am I supposed to know?
Do I have to decide everything now?

505
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,260
We'll jump.

506
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,060
Fuck. You wanted to be
in command, Richard.

507
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,340
I only took command

508
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,580
because you lost
your nerve, French boy!

509
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,940
Yeah, and look where
you've taken us!

510
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,220
We'll jump.

511
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,820
If you're not happy
with the way things are going,

512
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,420
you can just take over.
All right, sir?

513
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,420
All right. I will.

514
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,020
There. We'll
climb down there.

515
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,780
We can jump.

516
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,460
Francoise, look.

517
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,820
We're not gonna jump,
all right?

518
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,340
So just can it.

519
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,940
And as for
climbing down there,

520
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,940
that is just
an asshole suggestion!

521
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,060
You calling me
an asshole?

522
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,220
Yeah, and that's
just the start of it.

523
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,980
All right, fuck-face,
let's do it.

524
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,580
All right, motherfucker.

525
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,820
Etienne: Francoise!

526
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,340
Shit.

527
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,300
Francoise!

528
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,140
Francoise: Come on, guys.
It's okay.

529
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,980
It's not dangerous.

530
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,980
Come on.

531
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,420
Drop the bags down.
Come on!

532
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,140
All right.
So we'll jump.

533
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,820
Oh, fuck.

534
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,220
Both: Aah!

535
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,460
Etienne: Oh, fuck!

536
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,180
Waah!

537
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,180
Wahoo!

538
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,460
Did you see that shit?

539
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,820
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

540
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,700
Richard: Oh, my God!

541
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,340
Congratulations!

542
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,260
Took me the best part
of an hour

543
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,860
to work up the balls
to do that.

544
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,620
Mind you,
I was on me own.

545
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,100
So you have to
make allowances.

546
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,620
You know what I mean?

547
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,580
I think maybe
you better meet up with Sal.

548
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,500
Jesus Christ!
We're fucking here!

549
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,660
Do you realize that?

550
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,980
Don't you go anywhere!

551
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,980
All right.
Doing well.

552
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,140
Ciao, Sonja.

553
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,380
Hi.

554
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,940
Noisy kitchen.

555
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,420
Howyou doing?

556
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,420
What's for dinner?

557
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,780
Man: One guess. Fish.

558
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,460
Richard: I don't know
what we expected,

559
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,860
people living in a cave?

560
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,340
Maybe even
a few guys in tents..

561
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,580
Gregorio.

562
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,940
But nothing like this.

563
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,060
How are you, Keaty?

564
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,340
Roll 'em.
Don't smoke 'em.

565
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,300
It was like we arrived
into a lost world,

566
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,620
a full-scale community
of travelers,

567
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,620
not just passing through,

568
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,780
but actually living here.

569
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,780
I suddenly became aware

570
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,940
that we weren't
even invited.

571
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,060
Richard:
The guy who drew it..

572
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,180
Daffy.

573
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Yeah. Yeah. He's dead.

574
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,420
Man: What?

575
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
Second man: No way.

576
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,620
Yeah. He cut his wrists
open in a hotel room

577
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,180
on the Khao San Road.

578
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,380
You have seen this?

579
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Well, I came afterwards.

580
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,460
Well, that's sad news.

581
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,060
He was one of the founders
of our community.

582
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,940
Oh.

583
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,900
But he became depressed.

584
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,260
Woman:
This is crazy.

585
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,420
The police didn't know
what to do with the body,

586
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,180
so I guess they're gonna,
like, incinerate him

587
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,460
or something.

588
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,340
Doyou think he gave
a map to anybody else?

589
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,220
I.. i, no.
I don't think so.

590
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,580
And you, have you shown
this map to anybody?

591
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,100
No.

592
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,980
No.

593
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,820
No.

594
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,860
Good.

595
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,060
We value our secrecy.

596
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,980
Man: Yeah, burn!

597
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,660
Let's gag one.

598
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,900
You hear that?
You hear that?

599
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
C'est magnifiique.

600
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,860
Oh. it's so fucking
beautiful, man.

601
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,340
Neighbors.

602
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,260
Hey. I've got
your oils, man.

603
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,500
Here. I want to
give you something.

604
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,100
Listen up, everybody.

605
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:16,860
Okay. Tomorrow I will travel
for many miles on a bicycle.

606
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,140
Um, Vicki.

607
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,660
Uh, uh,
sutra cuputovati

608
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,580
mnogomillja biciklom.

609
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,060
Great. Very good. Helene.

610
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,620
Very good.

611
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,940
Sutra cuputovati
mnogomillja biciklom.

612
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,300
Sonja: Very good. Keaty?

613
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,260
All right.
It's far too easy, though.

614
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,700
Yes. Okay. Sutra cuputovati
mnogomillja biciklom.

615
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,980
There's more, you know.

616
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,300
He knows everything.

617
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,100
Richard!

618
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,020
Ahem.

619
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:04,660
Sutra cuputovati
mnogomillja biciklom.

620
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,340
Yes, Richard!

621
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,300
You're represented, man.

622
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,660
Sutra cuputovati
mnogomillja biciklom.

623
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,180
This became ourworld,

624
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,140
and these people,
our family.

625
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,580
Back home was
just one more place

626
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,620
we didn't think about.

627
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,380
I settled in.

628
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,380
I found my vocation:

629
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,020
the pursuit of pleasure.

630
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,340
Sal was the leader,

631
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,940
but it wasn't a big deal.

632
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,540
I mean, there wasn't
any ideology or shit like that.

633
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,500
It was just a beach resort

634
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,180
for people who don't like
beach resorts.

635
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,420
And some of us build.

636
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,340
Even paradise
takes a little shaping.

637
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,540
Richard: For years,
they kept this place a secret.

638
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,660
They didn't need
to tell anyone.

639
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,780
They were practically
self-sufficient.

640
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,820
The only thing
they had to do

641
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,740
was sail back
once in a while

642
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,780
to trade a little marijuana
and buy some rice.

643
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Whoa!

644
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,900
We grow our own,
which means no stealing

645
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,740
from the farmers
on the other side.

646
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,620
And do they know that
you're living here?

647
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,340
Oh, yeah, but they
keep to their side,

648
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,380
and we don't trespass
on their turf.

649
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,300
A couple of years ago,
they came to us,

650
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,580
and they said
that we could stay.

651
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,380
That was all right, but
nobody else should come.

652
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,500
Which kind of
suits us as well.

653
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,860
So, you was lucky,
you know? Very lucky.

654
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,100
Richard: There was Keaty,

655
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,620
who only cared
about 2 things..

656
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,580
Thank you, Lord,

657
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,020
for the twin pillars
of civilization:

658
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,620
Christianity and cricket.

659
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,220
There were the Swedes..

660
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,500
Christo, Sten, and Karl.

661
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,460
We like fishing.

662
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,220
Fishing. Yeah.

663
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,020
And in the winter,
we like skiing.

664
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,220
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

665
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,860
Of course, in Thailand,
there is no skiing.

666
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,380
We wait, okay?

667
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,500
We wait until
the fish come.

668
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,380
Get it?

669
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,140
Shit. No way!

670
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,180
Whoo!

671
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,620
And I said unto thee,
"I shall provide!"

672
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,980
Yeah!

673
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,940
- Stop it.
- What?

674
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,540
Richard: our resident chef
was known as Unhygenix..

675
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,820
Let's cook.

676
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,260
On account of
his obsession with soap.

677
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,300
Fish, fish, fish.

678
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,980
Still I smell fish.

679
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,060
Richard: There was
a range of sporting

680
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,700
and leisure activities
to suit all tastes.

681
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,500
Etienne is
good at soccer.

682
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,860
I could do that
if I wanted to.

683
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,060
I just
don't want to.

684
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,500
What are you talking about?

685
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,260
Making conversation.

686
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,820
Do you have a girlfriend?

687
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,420
Here?

688
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,180
Anywhere.

689
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,180
No. Why?

690
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,060
Just making conversation.

691
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,340
Right arm overwicket,
3 balls remaining.

692
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,300
Is there anyone who
still does not understand?

693
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,340
The only person
I didn't like

694
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,700
was Sal's boyfriend Bugs,
our on-island carpenter.

695
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,620
Hey, Richard.
Can you do this?

696
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,660
Can you make anything?

697
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,820
A man should have
a talent in his hands.

698
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,060
Here we go, people!

699
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,100
Whoo!

700
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,660
So every community
has its rituals.

701
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,140
Well, ours was simple.

702
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,900
The last one to arrive
tattoos the next.

703
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,260
It fucking hurts,
okay?

704
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,540
What did he say?

705
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,740
Aah!

706
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
Aah!

707
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,780
Andy,
bring yours closer.

708
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,460
Come on, Richard.

709
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,940
Oh, God!

710
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,780
Oh, God!

711
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,460
Oh, Jesus!

712
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,900
That fucking hurt!

713
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,740
All in all,
this really was paradise.

714
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,540
Except for one thing:

715
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,980
desire is desire
wherever you go.

716
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,740
The sun will not bleach it,

717
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,620
nor the tide wash it away.

718
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,500
Francoise.

719
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,100
One.. she's
just teasing you.

720
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,220
What are you
talking about?

721
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,620
2.. you don't
speak french.

722
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,180
3.. he speaks French.

723
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,180
In fact, even
better than that..

724
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,020
4.. he is French.

725
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,980
5.. he's much better
at football..

726
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,980
sorry, sorry..

727
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,980
soccer than you.

728
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,140
And 6.. you're
a bit strange, rich.

729
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,740
Some girls
like that in a man,

730
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,180
but not usually
the sort of girls

731
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,180
you want to be with.

732
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,260
Is that right?

733
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,020
Come on. Your last
girlfriend chucked you.

734
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,980
There must've
been a reason.

735
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,180
Well,
it was not my fault.

736
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,020
And 7.. look at, look
at your thumbs, man.

737
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,300
They're well defined.

738
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,820
What is that
supposed to mean?

739
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,820
You play
a lot of video games.

740
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,580
That is a powerful index
of incompatibility.

741
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,340
Well, why do I
get the feeling

742
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,100
like you're trying to tell
me something here, Keaty?

743
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,260
You haven't a hope,
mate,

744
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,660
not a bleeding chicken's
chance in Thailand.

745
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,060
Know what I mean?

746
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,980
Thank you.

747
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,020
So, enjoy the beach
and cut the bullshit.

748
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,340
Thank you very much.

749
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,420
It's my pleasure.

750
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,780
No. no.
You, no.

751
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,220
You cannot.. no. No! No.

752
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,660
Please leave me.
Leave me!

753
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,980
Hey,
that's my bed.

754
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,940
No!

755
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,900
I can
deal with it.

756
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,260
I don't want you
to deal with it!

757
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,740
It won't take
a minute, Gregorio.

758
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,220
No! Really, no.

759
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,140
No. I must
go to mainland!

760
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,780
I'm sick.
I've got to. Sal!

761
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,380
What's this?

762
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,380
You want to go to the mainland
to see a dentist?

763
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,940
Yes.

764
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,100
It's out of the question.

765
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,060
Come on.
It'll be fun.

766
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,260
I'll be the nurse.

767
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,780
It won't hurt. Be brave.

768
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,220
How's it going,
Richard?

769
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,580
Fine. Fine.

770
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,900
You okay with this?

771
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,980
- Yeah.

772
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,980
I mean, we have
a secret here, right?

773
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,540
Sometimes people need
to take a little pain

774
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,020
to keep it that way.

775
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,700
Excellent.
Excellent attitude.

776
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,220
No problem.

777
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,380
You'll be okay.

778
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,220
Oh, shit!

779
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,500
Good work!

780
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,980
Kill the pain, boy.

781
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,900
Okay.

782
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,940
Take the drink.

783
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,060
Take a drink.

784
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,020
Bugs.

785
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,980
Thank you, Bugs.

786
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,300
Thank you.

787
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,580
Richard?

788
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,260
Yeah.

789
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,580
Would you like to come
to the beach with me?

790
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,900
Come on, Etienne.

791
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,860
Just throw one, man.

792
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,100
Okay.

793
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,220
Seven of diamonds.
All right, man.

794
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,820
Sure. Yeah.

795
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,020
Francoise:
Areyou happy, Richard?

796
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,220
Richard: Happy?

797
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I guess.

798
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,900
I mean, the beach,
you know,

799
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,060
is just perfect.

800
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,660
Do you think
that I ignoreyou?

801
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,580
No.

802
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,100
But I do.

803
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,660
It's because
I'm with Etienne.

804
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,860
It's difficult for me
to spend time with you.

805
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,020
I don't suppose that
there's any, you know,

806
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,940
special reason
thatyou should..

807
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,780
spend time with me,
that is.

808
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,500
Of course there is.

809
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,500
I like you a lot.

810
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,300
Have you told
this to Etienne or..

811
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,380
No.

812
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,620
It's our secret.

813
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,740
Okay.

814
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,380
Look! There.

815
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,820
The plankton. Shrimps.

816
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,940
When they're disturbed,
they glow.

817
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,260
Come on.

818
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,620
That night,
we promised ourselves,

819
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,260
and we honestly believed,

820
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,420
that no one would ever know.

821
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,700
I want to talk.

822
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,100
About what?

823
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,780
Aboutyou and Francoise.

824
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,940
What do you mean,
me and Francoise?

825
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,180
I mean, Richard..

826
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,180
that I want her
to be happy.

827
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,860
Yeah.
I mean, of course.

828
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,380
We all do, right?

829
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,540
Shut up!

830
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,620
Please
shut the fuck up.

831
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,860
And if happy
is with you,

832
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,420
then I will not
stand in her way.

833
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,060
Etienne, man, I re..

834
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,820
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

835
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,100
Fuck you, Richard!

836
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,300
I know! Okay? I know.

837
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,420
Everybody knows!

838
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,220
The problem
is seeing the fish.

839
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,900
With the heavy rain
and the bad light,

840
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,580
it's very difficult
to catch them.

841
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,020
It could last for days.

842
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,460
Sometimes..

843
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,740
we get really hungry.

844
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,340
Give me that.

845
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,500
Richard!

846
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,580
Richard! Richard!

847
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,900
Richard!

848
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,980
I can't hear you!

849
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,460
You can't hear me.

850
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,380
- Shark!
- Shark!

851
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,140
Shark!

852
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,460
- Shark!
- Shark!

853
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,060
Nnhh!

854
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,220
All right. All right.

855
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,060
All right.

856
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,900
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

857
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,180
Now, before I start,
there's..

858
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,020
there'sjust a couple of things
you have to remember.

859
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,820
Number one,
you have to remain calm.

860
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,420
Right?

861
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,300
And number 2,
you have to show no fear.

862
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,340
Teach it. Teach it.

863
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,220
Because the sharks..
you see, the sharks,

864
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,700
they can sense that fear..

865
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,620
just as easily as they
can sense blood.

866
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,980
And so it went for me..

867
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,420
just as I knew it would,

868
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,380
just as nature
had ordained.

869
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,100
It's.. jaw..
wide open.

870
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,780
Row upon row
of these razor-sharp teeth,

871
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,300
glinting underwater
like jagged diamonds.

872
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,300
Its tail fin sweeping
back and forth as it

873
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,580
surged in for the kill.

874
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,100
I swear to God..

875
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,100
my whole life

876
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,820
Really. I had nothing
left to offer

877
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,740
except for pure reflex,

878
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,860
pure reflex and mankind's
basic drive for survival

879
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,540
that somehow shouts, " No!"

880
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,300
I will not die today!"

881
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,940
And at that instant, man,

882
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,660
I knew it was
either the shark or me.

883
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,900
The shark knew it.

884
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,500
I knew it.

885
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,700
But, jeez, God..

886
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,100
it it's nothing personal,
right?

887
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,540
You know, it's just
the way the world works.

888
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,500
Right? it's nature.

889
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,380
But if I remember
correctly..

890
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,060
in that last glimmer
of its eyes,

891
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,820
there was a moment between us..

892
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,300
where he said,
" Hey, Richard, man.."

893
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,700
"enjoy your dinner."

894
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:22,940
Uhh!

895
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,900
Aah!

896
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,140
Strange thing,
killing a shark.

897
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,300
Isn't it, Richard?

898
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,620
Just a big fish, Bugs.

899
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,900
Just a big fish?

900
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,140
Yeah, maybe.

901
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,100
Maybe when it's
just a baby

902
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,900
and it hasn't really learned
to kill yet,

903
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,860
then maybe
it's just a big fish.

904
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,740
But when it's
a great white angry mother

905
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,820
with a taste of human blood
on its tongue,

906
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,500
now, that's a different story.

907
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,660
Oh, God, jeez..

908
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,100
I'm.. i'm sorry, bugs.
Is it just me,

909
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,900
or does this wet weather
make everyone so damn tired?

910
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,020
Jeez, maybe we can hear
your very different,

911
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,620
and I'm sure
very interesting,

912
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,260
story some other time, huh?

913
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,740
Very interesting.
Keaty.

914
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,020
Vero interessanto.

915
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,980
Tim.

916
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,300
Hygie.

917
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,900
Molto interessante.

918
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,940
Good night,
young lovers.

919
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:27,900
Shut up.

920
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,860
Good night.

921
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,980
For a while,

922
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,020
we were untouchable
in our happiness.

923
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,140
All right, everybody.

924
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,900
Quiet.

925
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,340
We have a situation.
It's not a disaster,

926
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,820
but as some of you
may have heard,

927
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,180
a couple of sacks
of rice have become

928
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,980
contaminated
by a fungus.

929
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,260
That's 'cause we
keep it in that shack.

930
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,780
How many more times does
this have to happen?

931
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,940
Rice run.

932
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,780
Which means that someone
will have to come

933
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,940
to Koh Pha Ngan with me
to buy some more rice.

934
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,900
So don't all
volunteer at once.

935
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,860
Richard?

936
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,180
Yeah?

937
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,900
Are you gonna come
to Koh Pha Ngan with me?

938
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,340
I don't know.
I mean..

939
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,940
I'll go with you.

940
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,940
Don't worry, Bugs.

941
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,340
Richard's gonna come,
aren'tyou?

942
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,100
Am I?

943
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,420
Who thinks Richard
should come?

944
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,100
All right. Then I'll go
to Koh Pha Ngan with you.

945
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,500
Good.

946
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,180
I want a toothpaste and..
and a toothbrush, yeah?

947
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,260
All right.

948
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,940
Ahem. A new pair
of swim trunks

949
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,380
and a new hat.

950
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,300
Richard..

951
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,060
100 aspirin,
100 paracetamol,

952
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,580
6 packs of tampons..

953
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,940
and 4 double a batteries
and 20 condoms.

954
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,300
Make it 40 condoms.

955
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,780
And a bottle
of vodka.

956
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,180
6 bars
of chocolate..

957
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,260
Oh, fuck this.

958
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,700
4 boxes of tampons,
assorted sizes.

959
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,420
Smell it.
It's a part of me.

960
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,740
I am becoming a fish,
Richard.

961
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:14,020
Ordinary soap for ordinary
people is a waste of time.

962
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,300
I need something toxic,
something industrial. okay?

963
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,300
Okay.

964
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,460
A tin of beef curry.
Yummy.

965
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,580
Yummy.

966
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,300
As many triple-a batteries
as you can find, right?

967
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,820
And a copy of..

968
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,260
the Daily Telegraph.

969
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,860
Just for the cricket,
you know?

970
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,940
Oh.

971
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,380
Please fill this bag
with a soft bog roll.

972
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,980
Soft bog roll?

973
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,940
Jasmine tea, tiger balm,
lip balm, tea tree oil..

974
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,580
a big box of bleach.

975
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,220
Hair conditioner,
skin conditioner..

976
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,460
anything based on sugar.

977
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,620
12 packs of rizla..

978
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,380
cumin, saffron, cinnamon..

979
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,900
antiperspirant,
and makeup remover.

980
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,380
Ahem.
What do you want?

981
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,020
Aah! Oww!

982
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,980
When you get to Koh Pha Ngan,

983
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,420
keep your hands to yourself
and your dick in your pants.

984
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,660
Haah, haa haa,
haah..

985
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,020
Ohh.. shit.

986
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,500
Oh, shit.

987
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,700
I'd really
been looking forward

988
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,420
to air conditioning
and some cold beer,

989
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,660
but when we got
to Koh Pha Ngan..

990
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,900
I just wanted
to leave again.

991
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,220
And in one moment, I understood
more clearly than ever

992
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,660
why we were so special..

993
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,100
why we kept our secret..

994
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,860
because if we didn't,

995
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,420
sooner or later,
they'd turn it into this.

996
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,180
Cancers..

997
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,660
parasites..

998
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,420
eating up the whole
fucking world.

999
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,780
A couple months.

1000
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,340
Maybe a year, even.

1001
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,780
Yeah, really.

1002
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,940
No. I like it out here,
you know?

1003
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,180
Things are different.

1004
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,780
Are different!

1005
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,660
Yeah.

1006
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,180
No. I'll call again.
I'll call again.

1007
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,860
I promise.

1008
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:32,860
Okay.

1009
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,140
All right, I miss you, too.

1010
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,220
All right.

1011
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,460
Okay.

1012
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,580
All right, bye.

1013
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,700
Bye.

1014
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,420
So, how does it feel to be
back in the real world?

1015
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,700
It's not
like I remembered it.

1016
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,980
It gets worse
every time.

1017
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,740
It is Richard!
Damn!

1018
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,820
God! How ya
doing, man?

1019
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,780
Good to see ya.

1020
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,540
Oh, Sammy,
come on over, man!

1021
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,300
Yo, Ricardo.
What's up, bro?

1022
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,820
Girls, I want you
to meet the man!

1023
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,380
He's the man.

1024
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,940
Hil und Eva,
deisem is Richard.

1025
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,980
The man
with the map.

1026
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,660
Dermensch mit
den wanderkarte?

1027
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,860
Yo, yo, rich.

1028
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,460
They're gonna
come with us, bro.

1029
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,420
They're coming
with us.

1030
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,860
Sorry it's been
so long,

1031
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,380
but, you know, we're
just chillin' out.

1032
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,500
You know how it is,
right?

1033
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,540
Listen, guys.
I.. i made a mistake.

1034
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,500
Mistake?
What mistake?

1035
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,460
What are you
talking about?

1036
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,380
No. Listen to me.

1037
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,300
There is no beach.

1038
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,020
I can't believe
to see you, dude.

1039
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,300
There's no beach?

1040
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,260
Yeah. No. Seriously,
the map thing?

1041
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,380
It was.. it was fake.

1042
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,660
It was just like
you said, dude.

1043
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,940
- It was a story.
- Right.

1044
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,620
No! it's.. it's a myth.
Really.

1045
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,780
I-it doesn't exist.

1046
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,100
- Come on.
- The map,

1047
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,340
- it was a fake.
- Yeah, yeah.

1048
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,340
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1049
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,620
You wouldn't be
holding out on us,

1050
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,620
would ya?
Let me guess.

1051
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,420
It's a fucking
paradise!

1052
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,380
It doesn't exist.

1053
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,460
Oh, man..

1054
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,540
what are you
talking about?

1055
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,620
I think,
you know, Zeph,

1056
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,780
he'sjust tryin'
to fuckwith..

1057
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,100
I'm trying to tell you
to forget it!

1058
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,140
All right, asshole!

1059
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,780
Well, that's the last time
I buy you a fuckin' beer.

1060
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,020
So you told them
where you were going?

1061
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,140
Yeah.

1062
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,660
And they saw the map?

1063
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,340
Mm-hmm.

1064
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,620
Do they have a copy?

1065
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,300
No.

1066
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,380
Okay.

1067
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,660
Well, we can relax for a bit.

1068
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,060
I doubt they have it in them
to get there, anyway.

1069
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,580
But, Richard, I don't think we
should tell anybody about this.

1070
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,700
Okay?

1071
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,100
I think we should keep it
between you and me.

1072
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,340
Thanks.

1073
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,460
Don't mention it.

1074
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,260
Whew.

1075
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,180
Well, I'm going
to go and play

1076
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,260
a couple of games of pool
with Sumet.

1077
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,980
Sumet? Snook?

1078
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,460
So, why don'tyou go
and warm the bed?

1079
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,300
Come on.

1080
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,860
Sal?

1081
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,660
Sal?

1082
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,620
Mm-hmm?

1083
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,740
I just have a question.

1084
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,460
It was very nice.

1085
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,340
No. That's not it.

1086
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,020
It's about Bugs.

1087
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,700
Okay.

1088
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,140
It's like this.

1089
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,940
Bugs is my boyfriend..

1090
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,340
my partner.

1091
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,340
Okay?

1092
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:27,820
And you are someone
I just had sex with.

1093
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,300
All right?

1094
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,140
Oh, th-that's fine.

1095
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,900
That's absolutely fine.

1096
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,180
Good.

1097
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,460
Now get some sleep.

1098
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,300
I maywish to have sex again
before we eat breakfast.

1099
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,300
It was a deal.

1100
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,300
She wouldn't tell anyone
about the map.

1101
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,780
I had paid for her silence
and bought my ticket back.

1102
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:15,140
But I didn't even want to
think about the real price.

1103
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,220
All right, Rich,
we're ready to heave!

1104
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,620
Okay!

1105
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,380
Got it, Keaty?

1106
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,500
Yeah!
No probs.

1107
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,060
Problem solved.

1108
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,460
All right,
here's your bleach.

1109
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,180
Who got
the makeup remover?

1110
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,980
I have 2 of'em.

1111
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,220
Extra! Extra!

1112
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,780
Oh, Richard, man!
I love you!

1113
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,540
One pretty little
pink bag for you.

1114
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,060
Oh, great!
Lovely.

1115
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,060
Did you get
batteries?

1116
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,020
Right here.

1117
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,020
Yes!

1118
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,700
Richard:
That's all for you.

1119
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,580
Hey, Ricardo!
Grazie.

1120
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,140
One tin of beef curry!

1121
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,900
One..

1122
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,620
disposable camera.

1123
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,300
I know it's not as good
as the one you left behind,

1124
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,820
and you'll probably have to
wait a while for the prints,

1125
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,500
but what the hell, right?

1126
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,220
No, it doesn't matter.
I like it.

1127
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,420
What's wrong?

1128
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,900
How was it?

1129
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,260
The rice run? Fine.

1130
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,500
No problem.

1131
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,580
I mean being with Sal.

1132
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,740
Fine. I mean,
we got along okay.

1133
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,460
Some people say
she's attracted toyou.

1134
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,180
Shit. I..

1135
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,020
I really wouldn't
have noticed that.

1136
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,540
Nothing happened?

1137
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:13,300
No, of course not.

1138
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,500
You promise?

1139
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,020
Richard:
I was so happy to be back

1140
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,900
that I couldn't bear
to spoil the moment.

1141
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:24,900
Yes. Yes, I promise.

1142
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,980
I missed you.

1143
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,460
Okay, come on, everybody!

1144
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,700
Come on, please!

1145
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,700
Come on, please.

1146
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,020
All together.
Close together.

1147
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,500
Please.

1148
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,740
Okay, close together.

1149
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,940
Okay, stand back there,
please.

1150
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,660
Okay.

1151
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,900
So 1 ..2..3!

1152
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,020
Richard: so I started
just where I'd left off.

1153
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,340
It was almost like
my trip to Koh Pha Ngan

1154
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,260
never happened.

1155
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,460
Almost.

1156
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,660
Shark!

1157
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,540
Shut up, you fucker!

1158
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,700
My leg.

1159
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,660
My leg.

1160
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,500
We can take you to
the hospital, all right?

1161
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,580
We can do that.

1162
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,060
But when you're there,

1163
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,020
you mustn't tell anybody
where this happened.

1164
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,020
All right? We have
to keep our secret.

1165
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,180
What's he saying?

1166
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,980
He says that we
are to bring help

1167
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,940
here for him.

1168
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:20,820
He won't go
near the water.

1169
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,100
Yeah, well,
I understand that,

1170
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,700
but we can't
bring anybody here.

1171
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:24,660
We can't do that.

1172
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,300
Bring help!
You gotta bring help!

1173
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,700
We can't, Christo!

1174
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,140
You have to go,

1175
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,500
oryou stay here
and take your chances.

1176
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,100
Anyone disagree?

1177
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,820
What is he
saying?

1178
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,860
He wants to know
what happened to his friend.

1179
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,100
Keaty: We're gathered
here today

1180
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:55,220
to say our last respect
to Sten.

1181
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,660
May God take your soul,

1182
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:01,340
and you will rest
forever in peace, mate.

1183
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,420
We'll miss ya.

1184
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,260
Yorgesca de from
Christo and me.

1185
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,460
Repost I im pace,

1186
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,380
from Lorenzo.

1187
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,500
Richard: After the funeral,

1188
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,820
we all tried to get
back to normal..

1189
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,460
But it just
didn't seem right.

1190
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,940
Pretty soon, it became clear

1191
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,460
that the problem
was Christo.

1192
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,580
Man: Shut up!

1193
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,580
You see,
in a shark attack,

1194
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,620
or any other major tragedy,
I guess,

1195
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:05,340
the important thing
is to get eaten and die..

1196
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,100
in which case,
there's a funeral,

1197
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,420
and somebody makes a speech,

1198
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,940
and everybody says
what a good guy you were..

1199
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:14,220
or get better,
in which case,

1200
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,660
everyone can
forget about it.

1201
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,820
I can't take this.

1202
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,940
Please.

1203
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,820
Get better or die.

1204
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,460
It's the hanging around
in between

1205
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,500
that really
pisses people off.

1206
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,460
Listen to me.

1207
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,620
You can't do this.
This is disgusting.

1208
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,380
Take him back.

1209
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,740
Fucking animals.

1210
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,780
What are you
doing this for?

1211
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,780
Huh? Tell me.

1212
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:52,900
How can you do this?

1213
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,740
Richard?

1214
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,100
Fucking bastards!

1215
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,620
Bastards.

1216
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,020
It would be
a lot easier

1217
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,420
to condemn our behavior

1218
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,820
if it hadn't been
so effective,

1219
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,820
but out of sight

1220
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,300
really was out of mind.

1221
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:21,620
Once he was gone,
we felt a whole lot better.

1222
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:25,460
On the beach, it's easy
to turn your back,

1223
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:28,300
but not always
so easy to forget.

1224
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,900
Pay them in dollars,
fuck their daughters,

1225
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,260
and turn it into wonderland,
Richard.

1226
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,860
Richard, come with me.

1227
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,820
Sal: is that
or is that not

1228
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:35,620
a map she's holding?

1229
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:40,380
And did you
or did you not

1230
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,060
make that copy?

1231
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:47,460
You know, the lying
doesn't bother me,

1232
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,660
but that map
is trouble.

1233
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,220
The farmers, right?

1234
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,300
You remember,
those men with guns.

1235
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,740
They said to us..
They told us..

1236
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,260
no more people.

1237
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,660
And now it looks like
we're handing out

1238
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:03,900
fucking tour guides.

1239
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:06,940
Sal, I mean..

1240
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,340
we could explain,
right?

1241
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,420
I mean, we could tell 'em
it was Daffy.

1242
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,900
"We could explain."

1243
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:19,540
I want you up here
every day

1244
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:20,980
until those people come.

1245
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,340
- Here?!
- Yes, here.

1246
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,620
And when they come,

1247
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,740
I want you
to get the map back.

1248
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,420
Okay? Whatever happens,
you get the map back.

1249
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,740
W-w-wait, Sal.

1250
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,020
Wait. Sal,
take a look at this.

1251
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,620
I mean, they could
be there forweeks.

1252
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,060
That's right, and you'll
be here waiting for them.

1253
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,940
W-what am I supposed to do
when they actually get here?

1254
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,500
Get the map!

1255
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,460
You drew it.
You handed it out.

1256
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,980
Now you get it back
and turn them away!

1257
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,020
Sal! Sal!

1258
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,740
Are you gonna tell
everyone else what I did?

1259
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,180
Now, this was truly
a pain in the ass.

1260
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,980
I mean, I didn't want
these people to come here

1261
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,500
any more than Sal did,

1262
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,620
but what exactly
did she expect me to do?

1263
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,100
Chase them away?

1264
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,180
Threaten them?
I mean, with what?

1265
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,620
By the time
these kids got here,

1266
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,060
I'd probably
have starved to death.

1267
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,580
Sal?

1268
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:19,540
Sal, is that you?

1269
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,540
Get that light
out of my..

1270
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,780
You're a pig!

1271
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,780
Damn it!

1272
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,900
What the fuck
was that for?

1273
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:24,980
Look, there's
nothing I could do.

1274
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,460
I have to
stay up here!

1275
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,660
Not that, okay?

1276
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:29,660
What is it, then?

1277
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,420
You and Sal
in Koh Pha Ngan.

1278
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,420
Oh, that.

1279
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,900
Yes, that!

1280
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,340
She has told everyone,

1281
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,460
and me, I'm the last one
to find out!

1282
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:42,860
At least she believes
in honesty, not like you.

1283
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,100
I mean, Francoise, I..

1284
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,740
Wh-what can I say?

1285
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,980
Nothing.
There is nothing you can say.

1286
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,420
Thank you.

1287
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,780
Thank you for making my life
just perfect!

1288
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,300
Super!

1289
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,100
God damn it!

1290
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,060
Shit!

1291
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,700
You are
such an idiot!

1292
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:23,660
Even though I knew
it would happen,

1293
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,740
I was crushed.

1294
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:27,900
And I guess I deserved it.

1295
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,340
I mean, I could have
given her

1296
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,180
all the excuses she wanted,

1297
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,140
but it still wouldn't have
made any difference.

1298
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,580
Great! Great!

1299
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,580
At first, I thought
I was gonna die up here,

1300
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:45,300
that my entire world
was gonna end.

1301
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:51,060
But it didn't.

1302
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,620
In fact,
pretty soon, I found

1303
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,180
that there were
plenty of other things

1304
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,460
to keep me occupied,

1305
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,740
and before I knew it,

1306
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,700
I found that love..
like grief..

1307
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,540
tends to fade away

1308
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,620
and be replaced
by something more exciting.

1309
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,100
And life up on the hill

1310
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,260
turned out to be
a big improvement.

1311
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,700
I mean, up here, I could do
whatever I wanted.

1312
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,020
There was no fishing duty,
no gardening shit,

1313
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,180
no hassle from Bugs
or Etienne or Francoise.

1314
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,060
I was playing
my own game now,

1315
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,780
and I had absolutely
no reason to go back.

1316
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,180
Okay, so I was just
foolin' around..

1317
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,340
but the longer I stayed away
from the community,

1318
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,700
the less I missed them.

1319
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:47,860
And I found new players,

1320
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,060
even if they
didn't know it yet.

1321
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,140
This forest
was my territory..

1322
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:50,900
retrieving the map,
my mission..

1323
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,620
and these, my defenders.

1324
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,580
I was the only one
with the overview

1325
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:08,420
ofhow it all
fitted together:

1326
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:13,060
the island..

1327
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,860
me..

1328
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,580
them..

1329
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,460
the invaders.

1330
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,260
All connected,

1331
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:34,860
all playing the same game.

1332
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,780
And at the center of it all,

1333
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:41,740
one man.

1334
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,180
Daffy.

1335
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,500
Inside!

1336
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,740
Take a look, Richard!

1337
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:15,900
Viruses, Richard!

1338
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,300
Cancers!

1339
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:20,460
The big, chunky charlie's
eating up the whole world!

1340
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,580
Right there!

1341
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,020
Down on the beach!

1342
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,500
Down on the street!

1343
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,060
Pay them in dollars
and fuck their daughters!

1344
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,780
It starts with 4,
Richard!

1345
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,460
4, but they multiply!

1346
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,060
They multiply!
It's time to stop them!

1347
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:42,180
Year zero, kiddo!

1348
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,940
Year zero!

1349
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:47,140
Areyou with me
or against me?

1350
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,340
I'm with you
all the way, Daffy!

1351
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:55,700
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah! Yeah!

1352
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,380
Richard?

1353
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,980
Yeah.

1354
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:15,260
Where you been, man?

1355
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:20,740
What are you doing
sitting in the dark?

1356
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,860
Improving
my night vision.

1357
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,980
What for, man?

1358
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:29,500
You know who
I think about a lot?

1359
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:31,900
I have no idea.

1360
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:37,140
Daffy.

1361
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,900
Daffy?

1362
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,260
Uh-huh.

1363
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,180
I admire him.

1364
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,580
You hardly knew him.

1365
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,540
True..

1366
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,860
but he had
a certain style.

1367
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,340
Come here.

1368
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:04,940
- Now.

1369
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,900
Fucking come here!

1370
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,860
Get in there.

1371
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,420
They're talking
about you.

1372
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,300
He does
no work in the garden.

1373
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,380
But he
steals our food.

1374
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,420
I'm sure of it.

1375
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,780
You hear that? You hear
what they're saying?

1376
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:35,020
Idle, sponging,
useless prick!

1377
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,060
Now get your fucking act
together, Richard, man.

1378
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,020
You can't do this.

1379
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,140
You can't run around
in the dark

1380
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,180
not talkin' to nobody.

1381
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,380
What you think
you're playin' at, man?

1382
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,700
What's happened toyou?

1383
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,940
You was all right.

1384
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,420
Just a couple of weeks ago,
you was fine,

1385
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,060
and now
what the fuck is going..

1386
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,740
Look at you.

1387
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,700
And you're
talking about Daffy?

1388
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:54,380
Daffy was a nutter,
right?

1389
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,540
He went up there,
and he lost it.

1390
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:56,780
He's gone.

1391
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:01,700
Richard. Richard.

1392
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,420
Do you hear
what I'm saying toyou?

1393
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,900
Don't lose it like him.

1394
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,340
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1395
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:08,900
Don't go there.
Stay with us.

1396
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,580
Co-come back, Rich.

1397
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,940
These are good people.

1398
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,180
They don't talk about people
all the time.

1399
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,780
They're talking about you
because you're fucked up.

1400
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,580
All right?
Don't do this, man.

1401
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,060
I got it under control.

1402
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:44,300
And now it looks like we're
handing out fucking tour guides!

1403
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:04,940
Mushroom, Richard?

1404
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,620
No, thank you,
Daffy.

1405
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,060
I don't need
any help

1406
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,820
to see the writing
on the wall.

1407
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,620
I'm very glad
to hear that, Richard.

1408
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:13,620
Got to keep
my head clear.

1409
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:14,580
You know what I mean?

1410
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,100
Getting closer.
Any day now.

1411
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,060
Year zero?

1412
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,500
That's the spirit,
kiddo.

1413
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,980
You know something?

1414
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,900
You led the way,
Daffy.

1415
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:27,180
You showed me
the truth.

1416
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,140
But it doesn't matter
what I think anymore.

1417
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,100
It's up to you now.

1418
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,820
I won't
let you down.

1419
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,540
Hey, Richard.

1420
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,540
No offense, but, uh..

1421
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:43,500
You're fucked in the head,
right?

1422
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,060
It's been real nice
knowing you, Daffy.

1423
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,820
We're on patrol
in the delta.

1424
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,820
Search and destroy.

1425
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,300
We're not making
any contact.

1426
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,820
So the lieutenant,
he says to me:

1427
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:24,060
You get out there
and draw their fire!

1428
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:27,140
It's never
gonna happen, sir.

1429
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,620
Are you refusing
an order, son?

1430
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,500
It certainly
looks that way, sir.

1431
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:36,820
Yeah, it looks
that way, sir!

1432
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:40,660
My M-16just went off, man.

1433
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:41,980
It just went off.

1434
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:50,220
What are we
waiting for? Let's go!

1435
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,380
Whoo-hoo!

1436
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,260
There's no other
explanation, man!

1437
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,700
We're in dope heaven!

1438
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:47,740
Hi.

1439
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:48,820
Oh, shit.

1440
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:51,980
We're Americans.

1441
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:54,780
Tourists.

1442
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,780
American.

1443
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,980
We, uh,
we.. we had a map,

1444
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:00,700
and we..
we came here,

1445
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,700
but we made
a mistake.

1446
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,660
We made a mistake,

1447
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,060
and.. and
we're sorry.

1448
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,820
We'll go now.

1449
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:13,580
Come on.

1450
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,820
Um, we just want..
we just want to go.

1451
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,060
Give 'em
something, dude.

1452
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,980
Give them some money.

1453
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,540
Look!
American dollars!

1454
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,620
I've got
American dollars.

1455
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,020
You want American money?

1456
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:35,100
Here. You can have them.

1457
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:36,380
Hey, hey, hey.

1458
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,300
Um..

1459
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,300
I've got..
i've got my watch.

1460
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,260
It plays a tune.

1461
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:15,380
This is
our sixth year.

1462
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,580
Yeah!

1463
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,620
I want
to look ahead..

1464
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:27,540
because I see that
beyond any problems

1465
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:30,620
that we might have had,
right..

1466
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:35,380
beyond any problems
that we might have..

1467
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:39,060
that we have so much
here to inspire us.

1468
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:44,540
And I'm not just talking
about the island.

1469
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:48,020
I'm talking about you.

1470
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:51,660
You are what
makes this place work.

1471
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:54,300
And it does.

1472
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:00,860
I tried to remember
the person I used to be,

1473
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,180
but I just couldn't do it..

1474
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:05,020
To the island!

1475
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,140
To you!

1476
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:07,980
And so long
as I stayed here..

1477
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,900
to the future!

1478
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,980
I'd never find him again.

1479
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:30,780
Come with me.

1480
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:31,860
I've got to
talk to you.

1481
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,340
Listen, I've got
to talk to you!

1482
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,300
Stop!

1483
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,620
Listen to me!
I've got..

1484
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,140
I've got to talk
to you! Stop!

1485
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:40,340
Francoise, listen!
I've got to talk..

1486
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:43,180
Stop!
God damn it! Stop!

1487
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,180
Stop it!

1488
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:46,460
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop!

1489
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,780
I'm not gonna hurt you!
All right?

1490
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:52,340
It's just me.
It's just me.. Richard.

1491
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:53,940
Remember?

1492
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:57,180
The guy who can't
play soccer.

1493
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,980
The guy without
a girlfriend.

1494
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,180
Remember?

1495
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,620
I've just been away
for a while.

1496
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:11,820
That's all.
That's all.

1497
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:23,140
Listen. Etienne,
I really fucked up.

1498
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,580
4 people are dead.
I don't know what else they're gonna do,

1499
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,020
but we have
to leave now.

1500
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,940
That's it.
Just the 3 of us.

1501
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,780
Just like before.

1502
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:31,740
Richard..

1503
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:36,140
I can't leave him.

1504
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:38,500
Then, we'll
take him with us.

1505
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:39,980
But look at him.

1506
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,340
Look at him, Richard.

1507
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:44,580
We can't move him.
It's gangrene.

1508
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:47,500
It's spreading.

1509
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,020
He's gonna die.

1510
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,140
Wait for me
at the boat.

1511
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,460
Christo had suffered

1512
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:48,700
because we wouldn't
let anything spoil our fun.

1513
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,540
In the perfect
beach resort,

1514
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:55,860
nothing is allowed
to interrupt

1515
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:57,500
the pursuit of pleasure.

1516
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:00,740
Not even dying.

1517
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,940
Do you think
I want to hurt you?

1518
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:18,620
I'm a farmer.
That's all. Understand?

1519
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,860
I work.

1520
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:24,300
I send the money
to my family.

1521
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:30,980
If too many people
come to this island,

1522
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:32,740
it's trouble for me.

1523
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:36,100
I can't work,

1524
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,900
I can't send the money,

1525
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:40,660
and my family don't eat.

1526
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:46,340
I said no more people,

1527
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,500
but more people come.

1528
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,660
And you.

1529
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,780
You give them the map!

1530
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:04,700
Now, you all go home.

1531
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:08,540
Forget this island.
Forget about Thailand.

1532
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:10,660
Understand? Huh?

1533
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:11,620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1534
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,860
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1535
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:15,820
No.

1536
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:17,180
What?

1537
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,140
No.

1538
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:22,500
We're not leaving.

1539
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:25,860
This is
our home, too.

1540
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:27,740
This is our house.

1541
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:29,900
We built it
with our own hands,

1542
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,620
and we are not
leaving.

1543
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:35,500
Oh, Sal. Sal.

1544
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:36,740
I think..
i thinkyou're making

1545
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,820
a big mistake here.
Really.

1546
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,940
If he says
that we should leave..

1547
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,580
Richard, shut up!

1548
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,060
This is all
your fault, anyway.

1549
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,540
You copied the map,
Richard.

1550
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:10,980
You are a clever boy.
The one who sneak around.

1551
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,140
You steal from us,

1552
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:13,420
Let him go! Ugh!

1553
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,500
Play with guns,

1554
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:18,940
and you bring
people here.

1555
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,780
If you want to stay.

1556
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,820
If you want to stay.

1557
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,660
Sal. Sal.

1558
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:15,180
Fuck. Sal, no!

1559
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,940
Sal. Listen.

1560
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:18,500
Don't be crazy, okay?

1561
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:19,500
You can't!

1562
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,580
Don't be crazy, Sal.
Put the gun down.

1563
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,220
You let us down,
Richard.

1564
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:24,380
You brought us
trouble.

1565
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,300
You can't, Sal.

1566
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:29,340
Make her stop!
Make her stop!

1567
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,180
You need to help!

1568
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:34,900
You need to help me!

1569
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,660
You fucking bastards!

1570
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,460
Come on, Sal.
Please, Sal.

1571
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:52,420
You can't do it.
You can't do it, Sal.

1572
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,540
Fuck!

1573
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:55,180
'Cause if you
pull that trigger, Sal..

1574
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:56,260
if you pull
that trigger,

1575
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,220
it's all fucking over,
and you know it.

1576
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,340
Come on.

1577
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:01,300
'Cause this time..

1578
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,500
This time,
it's not like Christo

1579
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,580
rotting out in the woods
where no one could see.

1580
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:05,900
It's not like
the 4 people

1581
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:07,900
that I saw killed today.

1582
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:12,700
This time, everyone
has to watch, Sal.

1583
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:15,340
Everyone has to see
what it takes

1584
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:18,060
to keep our little
paradise a secret.

1585
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:20,500
Come on, everyone,
watch!

1586
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:21,460
Shut up.

1587
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:22,700
Everyone watch Sal
do this.

1588
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,140
Yeah, go on, Sal, do it.

1589
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:25,260
- Come on.
- Do it.

1590
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,300
Come on, do it, yeah.

1591
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,060
Let 'em see the blood
this time, huh? Huh?

1592
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:30,300
Let's see
if they can take it.

1593
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:31,460
God!

1594
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,540
They can take it.

1595
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:14,500
No! No! No! No!

1596
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:17,220
No! No! No!

1597
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:22,660
Come on.
Hold on to me.

1598
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:39,180
Game over,

1599
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:43,180
but she was never
gonna leave.

1600
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:46,340
She believed in it all
way too much to ever change,

1601
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:49,340
so that's exactly
where we left her.

1602
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,140
And as for the rest ofus..

1603
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:23,540
we carried away our sins
and made ourway back

1604
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:26,660
to wherever it was
that we called home..

1605
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:29,580
to pick up the pieces
of what ever was waiting.

1606
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:41,180
Of course, you can never
forget what you've done.

1607
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,580
But we adapt.

1608
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:45,220
We carry on.

1609
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,180
Can I getyou
anything?

1610
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:27,140
No, thanks.

1611
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,660
And me?

1612
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:32,940
I still believe
in paradise.

1613
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:35,860
But now at least I know it's
not some place you can look for.

1614
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:40,460
Because it's not
whereyou go.

1615
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:42,580
It's how you feel
for a moment in your life

1616
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:44,300
when you're a part
of something.

1617
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,700
And if you find
that moment..

1618
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,300
it lasts forever.
