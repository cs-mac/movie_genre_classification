1
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:44,305
Things have been going well.

2
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:47,405
I've been working
with these sick kids,

3
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:50,205
kids who've been
diagnosed with cancer.

4
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:53,604
And chemo when you're
twelve, like, sucks.

5
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:58,138
But... I mean, chemo
sucks in general,

6
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:00,705
but twelve sucks, it's
when it happens.

7
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:02,238
When what happens?

8
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,839
Are you girls ready to order?

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,738
Oh, I'll get the Cobb
salad, with the... oh,

10
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,271
no chicken, no bacon, no
cheese and no avocado.

11
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:15,437
Mm... I'll get the
burger and fries.

12
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,237
but maybe with her
bacon and her cheese,

13
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:20,671
and do not bring
me a dessert menu.

14
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:22,638
I already know I
want the cheesecake,

15
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:24,504
the brownie cheesecake.

16
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:27,604
I'm so glad you're not on
that stupid diet anymore.

17
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:30,237
It was making me
a miserable person.

18
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:32,772
So, I have some news.

19
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,598
What are you doing right now?

20
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,437
Just like your
typical sunday morning.

21
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,869
It's monday and it's
like noon in L.A.

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,603
Uh, how do you know that?

23
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,368
You don't even
fuckin' live here.

24
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,704
Okay. Well... you don't
even know my day right now.

25
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,470
I was having lunch with Becky.

26
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,469
We went to that place,

27
00:01:58,505 --> 00:01:59,735
Fucker!

28
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:00,838
I haven't started the story yet.

29
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,436
No. Ugh.

30
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:05,436
I just realized that the
guy I slept with sucks.

31
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:06,804
Would you stop thinking
about yourself

32
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:09,502
and your weird little
life for five seconds?

33
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:12,336
I was having lunch with Becky...
I have some news.

34
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:16,735
My point is, imagine
chemo on top of twelve.

35
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,168
It really makes you
appreciate what we have.

36
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,702
Yeah, it does.

37
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:24,468
So, things have been
getting pretty serious

38
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,868
with Dale and I, and I
haven't really told anyone

39
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:27,835
Can I say something?

40
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:28,867
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

41
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:30,102
I gotta conference in Katie.

42
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:31,503
Oh, for Chris sakes!
Tell her later.

43
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,268
No.

44
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,433
This story is so
fucking long already,

45
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:35,568
I'm not gonna
remember any of it.

46
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:36,670
So just hold on.

47
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:38,535
Welcome to club Monaco.

48
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,836
That's totally cute.

49
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:42,368
We don't have like anything
that cute in the store.

50
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:43,568
Okay.

51
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,335
Well um, hey, why don't
we try folding stuff?

52
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:48,635
Hello?

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,701
Katie!

54
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,582
Oh. I gotta take this.

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,135
It's work.

56
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,101
You're at work.

57
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:54,167
Hey, what's up?

58
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,103
I don't know. It's like...
some drama with Becky.

59
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,869
Tell me everything.

60
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:00,304
I haven't really told anyone...
Can I say something?

61
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:03,434
And I'm only saying this because

62
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,603
you're my friend and
I really care about you.

63
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:06,735
Do I have something on my face?

64
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,700
Guys like Dale,
born wealthy guys,

65
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:13,202
they hate going public

66
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:15,168
And if he doesn't
want to be with you,

67
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:17,402
it's because he's an asshole,

68
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:20,101
not because you're...
..one-eighth Jewish.

69
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:21,734
I mean, she's our friend.

70
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,334
I love her.

71
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:24,401
She has a pretty face.

72
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,135
Do you remember in high school,

73
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:28,401
all the boys used
to call her Pig Face.

74
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,368
Everybody called her
Pig Face in high school.

75
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,868
I mean, behind her back.

76
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,802
We've been friends since we
were little girls, Becky.

77
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:37,267
I want you to be with someone
who shouts it from the rooftops.

78
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:39,200
I know.

79
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:43,233
That's why I can't really
keep it a secret anymore

80
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:45,873
Dale asked me to marry him.

81
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,868
Oh... - That's insane.
- That's insane.

82
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,833
Okay. Back me up here.

83
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,400
I like, was...
totally gonna be the

84
00:03:58,401 --> 00:03:59,631
one to get married first.

85
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:02,234
Yeah. He's also like
super good-looking.

86
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:04,500
I googled him like
a-a few months ago.

87
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,201
Like, it's alarming.

88
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:07,482
I wanna date a
guy who has a job.

89
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:09,431
You know, we're all gonna have

90
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,835
to be in this wedding now.

91
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:12,333
Silver lining.

92
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,665
We're gonna get to throw
a bachelorette party

93
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,264
We're gonna get to
dress up and be cool.

94
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:16,499
It's gonna be just like prom.

95
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,398
I don't need to parade
around a bunch of people

96
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,632
that I used to know.

97
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,833
Clyde's gonna be there.

98
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,395
I'll probably go.
I've gotta go to work.

99
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:23,600
Yeah, shit.

100
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm fired by now.

101
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:27,199
I've gotta go read some
books to these cancer kids.

102
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,534
Love you Beeeeees!

103
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:31,515
ah-ah-ah-ah

104
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,498
deaf chords, dead ends

105
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:51,598
sling set can't
meet their demands

106
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,598
devil horns, best friends

107
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,499
infinity guitars, go head

108
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,665
ah-ah-ah-ah

109
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,632
street wars, straight men

110
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,733
cowboys, indians

111
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:06,432
red souls, red friends

112
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,132
infinity guitars, your heart

113
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,631
ah-ah-ah-ah

114
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:12,431
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

115
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:15,466
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

116
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:18,566
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

117
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,733
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

118
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,431
Are you so excited
for your big night?

119
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:27,497
I'm so excited.

120
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:30,399
I've been waiting for this for like...
...six months.

121
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,531
No... longer.

122
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,630
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

123
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:34,699
I've just been wanting
something to happen,

124
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,233
and now it is, and
all the Bee-Faces

125
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:38,731
are gonna be back
together again!

126
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,198
And I had a spray tan!

127
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,798
Ooh!

128
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,565
So excited! Hey!

129
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:44,831
Hey.

130
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,330
Um, do you think I
can get away with this,

131
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:48,299
or do I look like I'm
just one of the help?

132
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,267
No, you look really cute.

133
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,201
Did you just make a face?

134
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,732
Uh, no. No, she-she's retarded.

135
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,198
Uh, I mean sh-she

136
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,196
uh, Asper-Asperger's.
She has Asperger's.

137
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:01,432
She can't control her face.

138
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:02,930
LooVery fucking professional.

139
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,431
Okay. Now, I gotta
get on the train.

140
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,162
You got the deets for the
Bachelorette party?

141
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:08,163
Affirmative.
Deets, check.

142
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:11,831
Oh... Just in case.

143
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,330
Mm, you think of everything.

144
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,197
I do.

145
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:15,164
Wish me luck!

146
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,330
Good luck!

147
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:17,564
The dress is really nice!

148
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:19,363
Fuck you!

149
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:20,496
Now don't wear boots.

150
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,165
Fucking cogs!

151
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,362
Just get it together fast, okay.

152
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:24,643
Don't you dare miss this flight.

153
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,564
God, stop yelling at me, okay?

154
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:28,129
I'm not the one
getting fucking married.

155
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,596
What are you even
doing right now?

156
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,631
You're such a competent and

157
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:32,464
calming maid of honor, Regan.

158
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:33,386
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

159
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:35,163
Easy on the sugar.

160
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:35,666
She still has to fit
in her dress tomorrow.

161
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:37,226
Oh, Chinatown,

162
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,830
I need a limo to JFK.

163
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,864
Do you understand that?

164
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:42,664
And I need um, champagne
sent up to my suite.

165
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:44,198
Wait,

166
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:45,430
No.

167
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,130
Plans have changed, okay?

168
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:47,829
The bride wants a
bachelorette party now.

169
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,663
Oh, okay... Well, why
am I the last to know?

170
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,429
I can't believe you
get paid for this,

171
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,765
and I'm just a good friend.

172
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:58,229
about blowjobs,

173
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,630
if you want to hear it.

174
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,129
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

175
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,211
Yeah?
It's very interesting.

176
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:04,763
All right.

177
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:05,862
I-I personally think
that blowjobs are

178
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,161
an extremely delicate thing.

179
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:08,527
You know, like if you're..

180
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,694
if you're ranking them
on a scale of 1 to 10,

181
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,162
1 being I'm blowing it kisses

182
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:14,428
and 10 being I'm, you know,
choking on just semen,

183
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:17,361
vomit just everywhere.

184
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:21,395
I think you gotta start
off with 4s and with 5s.

185
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:24,195
Like just enough so the...
so that you know that

186
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,862
I know exactly what I'm doing,

187
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,696
but with zero enthusiasm.

188
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,728
I'm giving you nothing,

189
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,160
because then you're
gonna be like

190
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:32,861
all right, fine. I'll
just fuck her, you know?

191
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:34,861
'Cause if I start off with
a 10, I got nowhere to go.

192
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,861
I mean, why are you gonna
spend any time fucking me?

193
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,127
You just came all over my face.

194
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:38,727
So you start off small, right?

195
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:39,628
But you build.

196
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:40,729
I'll give you a 6

197
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,362
after a fight, when
we're making up.

198
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,762
And then an 8

199
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,761
when you spend a
shitload of money on me,

200
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:49,295
or get me something
that's like a sweet...

201
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:51,761
gift or whatever,
I'll do full 8.

202
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,095
But then, I circle it back.

203
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:57,694
Back to the 3s, the 4s, and
the 5s, because that shit,

204
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,096
every time, without fail,

205
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:01,395
makes the guy's
dick alarm go off.

206
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,696
You know what I mean
when I say dick alarm.

207
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:05,761
Right?

208
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,159
And you're gonna be like,

209
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,830
"Hey, baby.
What's wrong with you?

210
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:09,128
You're acting funny.

211
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,395
Why so sad?"

212
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:12,360
When really what you're
telling me is, "God dammit,

213
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,698
just like suck my dick harder."

214
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:21,594
So... um... let's just
say um, like, what...

215
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:23,428
what would merit a 10?

216
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:24,294
What's an example?

217
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,495
I don't know,
you're like on a...

218
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,127
on an airplane, you're going
to a wedding of this girl

219
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:33,093
that you went to
high school with.

220
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:33,795
Uh, two more?

221
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,327
Sure.

222
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,361
And your ex-boyfriend uh...

223
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:41,228
Your ex-boyfriend who
ruined your fucking life

224
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,394
is gonna be there.

225
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,394
That jerk.

226
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:46,259
All this pent-up frustration,

227
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,259
sitting next to some dude
you're never gonna see again.

228
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,559
That would warrant a 10.

229
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:57,160
Well... How about this guy?

230
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,527
Oh, no. I feel like I'll
definitely see you again.

231
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:16,827
Oh, my goodness.

232
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:17,659
Bee!

233
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
Look at her!

234
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,826
Bee-Face.

235
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,092
Aw, Bees!

236
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,125
We're together again!

237
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,247
Everything's okay, you guys.

238
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:24,560
All right.

239
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:26,560
How are we gonna get through
the next twelve hours?

240
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:27,860
Gena brought cocaine!

241
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:28,461
Oh, my god.

242
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,792
Let's use our indoor voices, about it...
you know...

243
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:33,825
Here's the deal, though.

244
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:35,859
We need to do some before
the bachelorette party.

245
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,760
Uh, it's not that
kind of a party.

246
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,293
Hear me out.

247
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:42,125
We don't want to share our
coke with rando bridesmaids.

248
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:43,159
It's for us.

249
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,125
It's true.

250
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,126
Bee-yatch-faces!

251
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,392
Ah-hah!

252
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:52,192
Woo!

253
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:55,326
I'm so excited, I
could buy a gun.

254
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:59,126
You guys are all
here, at my wedding.

255
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:01,791
Me... Isn't it just crazy?

256
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,358
Did Regan tell you guys
just how excited I am?

257
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,393
Yeah.

258
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:06,394
I see Regan all the time.

259
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:07,067
I'm sick of her.

260
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,326
Yeah. Feeling's mutual.

261
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:10,158
I'm so sick of you.

262
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,460
I'm sick of you, too.

263
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,492
There's my sick, running
down your shoulder.

264
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:15,392
Yuck!

265
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:17,560
You are the first
Bee-Face to get married.

266
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,596
Oh.

267
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:23,591
I'm gonna cry.

268
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:26,291
No, don't cry, 'cause
then I will cry too.

269
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,792
Like when we all watched

270
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,525
Princess Di's funeral
together, you remember that?

271
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:30,691
Too soon.

272
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:32,259
That was like fifteen
years ago, pal.

273
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,292
Uh, that was like
four years ago.

274
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:36,224
It was fifteen
years ago, Katie.

275
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:37,759
It was five years ago.

276
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,160
I think I know
when Lady Diana died.

277
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:41,858
Did Regan explain to you
about the par-tay tonight?

278
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:44,258
I was just trying to
tell them that, yes...

279
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,291
Well, okay. It's a little
last-minute,

280
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:50,858
- but... We are having champagne...
- Ooh!

281
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,357
and ice cream,

282
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:54,790
in our suite after
the rehearsal dinner.

283
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,857
Great!

284
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,625
And then we're gonna
like, party, right?

285
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:59,592
Like ah... like woo!

286
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,657
Like mm... Oh.

287
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:03,558
I know.

288
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,224
Yeah, boring.

289
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:05,826
Right.

290
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,790
Old, boring, almost-married
lady right here.

291
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,458
Yeah, it's just that uh,
a lot of the bridesmaids

292
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:13,757
came from out of town,

293
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:16,257
so I just had to keep
it really low-key.

294
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,156
And besides, I'm not a
big partier anymore.

295
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:20,726
Not like some people.

296
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,424
These two.

297
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:25,690
So... all right, well... I
think our car is waiting,

298
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:26,624
so let's all go.

299
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,690
Oh. Let's go.

300
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:33,124
Byeee... We're totally gonna
keep it low-key, too.

301
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,456
That's what we
were talking about.

302
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:35,791
Just keeping it low-key.

303
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,825
That's the kind
of girls we are.

304
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,091
Let's do some coke.

305
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,224
Yes!

306
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:48,356
Look at these people,

307
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:52,091
just desperate,
terrible, all of them.

308
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:54,555
They want to be like, in
what, legalized slavery?

309
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:55,823
That's what it is,

310
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,591
it's like a Jane
Austen novel on crack.

311
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,223
That's exactly right.

312
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:00,391
Should we do some more coke?

313
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:01,324
If you do anymore coke,

314
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:04,089
somebody's dick is
gonna get sucked.

315
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,590
Oh...

316
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,123
Here we go.

317
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,121
To you and your
beautiful daughter.

318
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:15,756
Yes, indeed.

319
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:17,190
Victoria,

320
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:18,488
are you feeling
confident about tomorrow?

321
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,223
Your walk down the aisle
was a little bumpy.

322
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:21,222
Was it bumpy?

323
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:21,291
I don't remember it being bumpy.

324
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:22,290
Are you kidding? Best man,

325
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,088
mother of the bride?

326
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,322
We got this on lockdown,
don't we, Victoria?

327
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,656
He's handsome and funny.

328
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:28,790
Are you married, Trevor?

329
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,456
No.

330
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:31,353
Oh. Yeah. No, no.

331
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:32,353
I'm trying, though.

332
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:33,454
I'm just, you know...

333
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:34,490
haven't found the
right girl yet.

334
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:35,855
Hey.

335
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:36,523
You know how Becky
wanted to keep it low-key?

336
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:40,555
Well... I got a stripper for
the bachelorette party.

337
00:12:40,556 --> 00:12:41,590
Stop your lies.

338
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:44,255
You don't know any strippers.

339
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:45,355
I do.

340
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:48,289
I know a freelance stripper.

341
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,826
That sounds amazing.

342
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,389
What's going on?

343
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:23,521
I just don't know...
how to do it.

344
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:26,188
Like in a bathtub,
with rope... I just

345
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:27,089
I gotta go do something.

346
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,187
Okay.

347
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,288
Please don't leave me alone.

348
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:30,258
Now honey, why can't you...

349
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,739
- ...find a nice man like this?
- Hmm?

350
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:33,354
Oh, come on.

351
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,288
Frank is never
gonna commit to you.

352
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,154
Frank? Who's Frank?

353
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:37,186
Her boyfriend.

354
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:38,353
He's doing his residency.

355
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:39,520
He'll be here tomorrow.

356
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:40,453
Yeah... Wow.

357
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:41,420
I bet he's busy a lot.

358
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,686
Tough to commit that way.

359
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:43,689
Let's just say
hi to aunt Janey, okay?

360
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,454
You don't want to be rude.

361
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:47,461
If you get bored,
I'll be right here.

362
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,388
Can I get you anything?

363
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:55,221
I'm-I'm good, actually.

364
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:56,460
- Hey.
- Hey.

365
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:01,590
Joe.

366
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:06,153
Joe... Barnes?

367
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:08,587
From back in the...
we went to...

368
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:09,452
high school together...
Do you...?

369
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:10,453
Do you have a job?

370
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:11,652
A job? Like out-like a...

371
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:13,418
yeah, I have a job um,
uh, in the world.

372
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,788
computer programming, actually.

373
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,587
Like a Steve Jobs
kind of thing?

374
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,419
Uh, hmm, kind-err, no.

375
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,787
Not at all, actually.

376
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,252
I didn't found Apple.

377
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:22,321
You don't remember me, do you?

378
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,685
Ah... The honeymoon
is a total surprise.

379
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:28,453
I haven't told her yet, but
I'm gonna blow her mind.

380
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:29,519
Boar hunting?

381
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,555
We're going to central Germany.

382
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:33,425
It's incredible. We should...
Gena?

383
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,154
Hi...

384
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:41,187
Hi, Clyde.

385
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:44,786
I haven't seen you since...
...that thing.

386
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:47,753
since that thing I
grew up next to Becky,

387
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,586
so I was kind of around a lot.

388
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:51,417
We would hang out
a little bit, and then

389
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:52,397
into high school, we were

390
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:53,454
in french class together.
Wait. I took french?

391
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:54,717
Yes.

392
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,321
You actually used to
copy my homework.

393
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,719
But no, it's-it's good.

394
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,586
I just wanted to say hi, and...
and uh...

395
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,219
say the hellos.

396
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,618
I-I sold you pot.

397
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,753
Oh, Joe!

398
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:08,785
That's-that's me.

399
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:09,686
You've got bangs!

400
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:11,252
Yeah, new bangs.

401
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:12,719
Do you have some?

402
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,654
Remember how I was telling you
about the Bee-Faces,

403
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:15,952
Becky's friends?

404
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,553
This is Gena Myers,
she's one of them.

405
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:18,684
Oh, hi.

406
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,486
Gena, this is my
sister, Stefanie.

407
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,151
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Myers.

408
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,454
Oh, no. I'm not married.

409
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,718
And um, I'm not an
adult, either, so...

410
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,820
Excuse me for a second.

411
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:29,419
The natives are
getting restless.

412
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,685
Oh... You two know each other from...
...high school.

413
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:34,984
since I was your age.

414
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,551
All right. I'm gonna go
sit down, but um... Okay.

415
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:41,518
will you come sit next to me?

416
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,219
Uh, well, whatever those
little place-cards say, okay?

417
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:46,455
Bye...

418
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:50,119
What?

419
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,251
I didn't say anything.

420
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,851
That is a... dress?

421
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:56,552
No, this is a t-shirt.

422
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,218
I'm glad to see you're still
fighting the good fight

423
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,184
against the tyranny of pants.

424
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,350
I also thought maybe

425
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,849
this would help you
get a head-start.

426
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,685
Maybe I'm looking
for a challenge.

427
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:07,683
Oh... is that why...

428
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:10,184
you're trying to
fuck a small child?

429
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:11,318
Good one.

430
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,650
You know what you should do?

431
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:14,751
Save the zingers for
the speeches, Genny.

432
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,117
Okay.

433
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:21,317
Our seventh-grade field trip

434
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:22,583
to Six Flags is
coming to a close.

435
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:23,819
We're all piling on
the bus to go home.

436
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,551
Dale lags behind,

437
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,485
'cause he just has
to ride the Freefall

438
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,851
at the last minute.

439
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:30,418
So he's running like
hell to catch up to us,

440
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:32,150
and he just bites it.

441
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:35,384
Wipes out completely, spills
what must be two liters

442
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,585
of Dr. Pepper all over his shorts,

443
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:38,717
just epic.

444
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:41,348
So later, he and I are sitting
in the back of the bus,

445
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:45,551
and I get a whiff of
Dr. Pepper and piss.

446
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:48,317
And I say, "You know,
it'd be pretty funny

447
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:52,083
if you pissed your
pants riding Freefall,

448
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:53,851
and then spilled Dr. Pepper
all over yourself

449
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:56,184
to try, cover it up."

450
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:59,451
And he turns to me, and he
goes, "Yes, it would be.

451
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,250
But it would also
be kinda genius.

452
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:04,149
Classic Dale.

453
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,549
Classic Dale.

454
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,183
Thank you, Trevor.

455
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:09,250
You weren't supposed
to make your speech

456
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:12,616
'til tomorrow, but... it's fine.

457
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,483
Now we have a special surprise

458
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:15,617
from the bride's cousins.

459
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,219
This is gonna be good.

460
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,116
Yo, Becky?
Say what?

461
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:28,681
Yo, Dale?

462
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:29,649
Say who?

463
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,450
Guess what?

464
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:31,515
What who?

465
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,449
You getting married!

466
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:40,115
United you stand,
divided you fall!

467
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:43,816
Becky and Dale,
you only get one shot!

468
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:49,582
Magic.

469
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:52,583
Okay, now

470
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,817
how about we hand it over

471
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:56,649
to one of our bridesmaids Gena?

472
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,821
Why don't you start us off?

473
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,482
Hey, welcome to the wedding.

474
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,347
Right?

475
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:10,682
Hey... Um... so, Becky.

476
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:12,348
I love you.

477
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:16,248
Uh, we met in the
high school bathroom.

478
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:17,209
You remember that?
Woo...

479
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:18,848
Yeah.

480
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,248
Yeah, I was in there um,
like, eating my lunch,

481
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:21,249
'cause I was kind of a loser.

482
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:25,182
And uh, she was in there...

483
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:31,646
That was just for like a-a...

484
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:34,450
she did that for like a w-...
a week.

485
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,852
Gena...

486
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:40,349
You guys...

487
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:45,347
I just want to make, actually,

488
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:48,848
a really important announcement.

489
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,713
I've lost my cell phone,

490
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,382
and last time I saw it,
actually it was...

491
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,814
it was back there, and I
feel like somebody took it.

492
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:57,547
All right.

493
00:18:57,548 --> 00:18:58,248
Thank you.

494
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,280
Wow.

495
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:02,827
Gena and Katie.

496
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:16,648
Having fun?

497
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:18,680
Yes.

498
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,614
Nice, isn't it?

499
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:20,814
Yeah.

500
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:27,246
Um, Katie and Gena... seem a little...
or... No... No.

501
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:28,180
Oh, your mom's
gonna give a speech.

502
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:31,313
Ladies, I would
like to give a toast.

503
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:33,212
So if you'd all
just gather 'round.

504
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,413
I want some fucking champagne.

505
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:38,113
I'd like to make
a toast to my little girl.

506
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:39,681
To Becky.

507
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,546
To Becky! And Dale!

508
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,678
To Becky and Dale!

509
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,714
To Becky and Dale!

510
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,345
I'm sorry, but you
aware of the complaints

511
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,281
we've been getting
about the noise

512
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:57,580
coming from this room?

513
00:19:58,314 --> 00:19:59,612
Uh, I'm so sorry.

514
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:02,512
We're just uh, we'll
keep it down.

515
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:05,577
I just... I'm getting
married in the morning.

516
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:08,078
Oh, I'm sorry, but... I'm
gonna have to search you.

517
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,247
Hey, wait a minute here.

518
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:10,649
What's going on?

519
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:14,712
He's not a real cop.

520
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,353
He's not a real cop.
Show me what you got,

521
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:17,578
breeders!

522
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:39,112
Come on, Pigface.

523
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:41,145
Let's get crunk!

524
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:42,212
No. Whoa.

525
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:43,617
What did you just call me?

526
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,714
What happened?

527
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:55,577
Why would he say that?

528
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:59,277
Because... because
it was just a j-... I mean,

529
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:00,309
he was joking around, you know.

530
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,410
It's fine, it's fine.

531
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:02,443
you're not Pigface, Becky.

532
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,410
Yeah... Nah.

533
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:05,243
Nobody calls
you Pigface anymore.

534
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:06,310
We're all having a good time.

535
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:07,610
Yeah, it's really funny.

536
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:08,579
Like how you told
everyone I was bulimic.

537
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,544
What the hell was that?

538
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:11,277
No.

539
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,678
Not like... not like that. Um...

540
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,277
not like that at all,
because that wasn't funny.

541
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:18,711
How would you like it,

542
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,412
if I just told everyone
some of your shit.

543
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,344
Yeah, that would be awesome.

544
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:24,245
You know what,
how about everyone goes,

545
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:27,511
you know? Like let's just...
take a rest

546
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:28,814
No. No. You know what?

547
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:34,478
Don't bother coming tomorrow,

548
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:37,577
unless you're gonna
act like normal people.

549
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:40,344
Of course.

550
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:40,847
Done.

551
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,111
Have a good night.

552
00:21:45,112 --> 00:21:46,843
It was nice to meet you.

553
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:49,221
Come on, sweetie.

554
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,245
What do you call a bachelorette
party without a bride?

555
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:04,744
Friday?

556
00:22:06,811 --> 00:22:09,778
Man... I really hate weddings.

557
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:12,581
I'm so glad you're here.

558
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:16,244
All right.

559
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:19,210
So like, let's assess
the situation.

560
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,144
Me! Me!

561
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:23,409
Becky's vagina's magic,
and she used it to

562
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,310
nab a perfect human being.

563
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,407
Magic's not real, right?

564
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:27,476
Magic is not real.

565
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,109
Yeah? How do you think I feel?

566
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,141
I've been planning this shit
for six months straight.

567
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,178
I'm ready to murder someone.

568
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:33,275
I believe it.

569
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:34,308
But wait,
what's her dress like?

570
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,276
I bet she looks beautiful.

571
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:36,377
Oh, my god.

572
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:38,442
Go get it.

573
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,442
Go get it!

574
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:41,274
Your mind's gonna be blown.

575
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,077
It's in there, it's
in the closet.

576
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:44,076
Bust it out.

577
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:47,543
You know what I
just keep thinking?

578
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:48,342
What?

579
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,775
I did everything right.

580
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:52,575
Yeah.

581
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,211
I went to college.

582
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,075
I exercise, eat like
a normal person.

583
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,176
Yeah.

584
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,417
I got a boyfriend
in med school.

585
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:07,412
And nothing... is happening...
to me.

586
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,310
Are you all right?

587
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:12,375
No! I just told you.

588
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:13,841
I'm fucking miserable.

589
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,541
Yo, coke whores.

590
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,709
Pippa Middleton is here.

591
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,542
Ah!

592
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,141
She put it on her body!

593
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:21,340
Oh, my god!

594
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,107
Guys, two people
could fit in this.

595
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,140
You know what you should do?

596
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,173
You guys should both get in it,

597
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:26,774
and then I'll take a picture
and put it on facebook.

598
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:27,809
We can tag Becky.

599
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,108
Oh, my god.

600
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:30,470
That's a genius idea.
Do it! Do it!

601
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:32,407
Do it! Oh god!

602
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:33,741
Take the picture.

603
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:35,208
Oh, my god!

604
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,476
If we fit in this,
I am gonna pee my pants.

605
00:23:36,477 --> 00:23:38,175
You know I'm gonna fit in it.

606
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:39,308
No, we're not.

607
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:40,478
We're gonna fit in it.

608
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:44,542
Oh, god.

609
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:46,408
It's like we're one person.

610
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:47,707
Yeah.

611
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,640
Oh, now we're in the circus!

612
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:50,441
Oh!

613
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:54,374
It-it's totally ruined.

614
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,408
Oh, my god!

615
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,741
Take it off... Just take it off.

616
00:23:57,742 --> 00:23:59,108
Oh, my god!

617
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:00,674
Just... step out slowly.

618
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:04,575
Oh, my god.

619
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:06,675
Tell me this is okay.

620
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:08,706
Tell me she can
still wear that.

621
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:09,773
It's okay.

622
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:11,206
She can still wear it.

623
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:11,768
It's not okay.

624
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:13,607
that's unfixable!

625
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,306
We're fucked!

626
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:16,607
Okay. We-you know what?

627
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:18,206
We're just gonna hide it.

628
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,287
We're gonna have to make it
look as if somebody just,

629
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:21,672
you know, they broke
in and they stole it.

630
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:23,672
No... We're gonna make it look

631
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:24,739
as if the place is ransacked.

632
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,675
What are you doing?

633
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:27,107
Watch out!

634
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:27,806
What the fuck are you doing?

635
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:28,609
Stop!

636
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:30,642
Burglars!

637
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:32,239
Stop it! Stop it.

638
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,475
Everybody just calm down.

639
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,308
Okay?

640
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,475
We need to fix this.

641
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,673
All right?

642
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:37,674
I thought you said
that was unfixable?

643
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,807
Well... I have done so much coke

644
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:42,340
that I should be dead, okay?

645
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,074
I should have died
like ten minutes ago,

646
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:46,740
so perhaps we should get a
second opinion.

647
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:48,173
This is an emergency.

648
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:49,138
It's an emergency.

649
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:50,139
An emergency.

650
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,140
I'm sorry,
but I can't help you.

651
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:53,504
Well, what are we
paying you for?

652
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:54,674
We're not paying her, Katie.

653
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:56,138
Somebody is paying her.

654
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:57,105
That's true.

655
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:57,704
Somebody is paying you.

656
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,838
Woo! Not enough.

657
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,072
You're supposed to
help the guests of the hotel

658
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:02,272
Are you a volunteer?

659
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:03,405
What kind of false
economy is this?

660
00:25:03,406 --> 00:25:04,607
Are y'all high?

661
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,573
Come over here.

662
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,306
Yeah.

663
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,540
I don't think she speaks
English that well.

664
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,273
You're not coming
to the wedding?

665
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:14,639
Oh, my god.

666
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,306
Your residency,
my ass, fuckface!

667
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,338
You knew about this for months!

668
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:19,305
Shit is going down!

669
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:20,108
I need you here.

670
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:25,639
Frank... Frank... Frank...

671
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:27,538
Regan!

672
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,837
We have a bit
of a catastrophe here.

673
00:25:28,838 --> 00:25:30,918
You wanna help us fix the fucking dress?
How's Frank?

674
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,276
Fuck Frank!

675
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:38,139
Okay... please?

676
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,706
There's gotta be
something you can do here.

677
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:43,539
This is housekeeping, not
project Runway.

678
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,137
You need a tailor.

679
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:47,238
Tailors don't work
in the middle of the night.

680
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,603
Okay. Girlfriend to girlfriend,

681
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:50,538
you gotta be able
to work this out. Come on.

682
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,171
Bring it back first
thing in the morning,

683
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:53,138
and I can clean it for you.

684
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:54,271
Clean it?

685
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:55,705
It doesn't need to be cleaned.

686
00:25:55,706 --> 00:25:56,837
Oh, my god!

687
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:58,337
Who's bleeding?

688
00:25:58,338 --> 00:25:59,605
Wait... I'm not...
Am I bleeding?

689
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:01,205
Am I bleeding?

690
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:02,171
Oh, my god!

691
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:03,104
You're bleeding!

692
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,171
You're bleeding!

693
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:05,471
What, I'm bleeding?

694
00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:06,804
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

695
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:08,705
Girl, you bled on the
dress, you moron!

696
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:10,373
Oh, god!

697
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:12,672
Okay. What we need right now

698
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:14,738
is like an epically
brilliant plan, you know?

699
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,104
That's what we need.

700
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:17,071
So are you ready?

701
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:18,103
One, two, three, go!

702
00:26:18,104 --> 00:26:19,170
Leave the country!

703
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:21,371
I'm gonna call Melissa, the
girl we got the dress from.

704
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,702
Jesus H. Macy, that's a
brilliant fucking plan!

705
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:24,836
How much cash you have?

706
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:26,503
I got five maxed
out credit cards.

707
00:26:26,504 --> 00:26:27,984
I have a twenty-dollar...
I ripped it.

708
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:29,235
I got nothing.

709
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:30,196
That sums up your lives.

710
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:37,470
Whoa!

711
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,705
Caught in the act.

712
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:40,136
Oh, shit.

713
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:42,304
Busted. Hah-hah.

714
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:42,405
Looks like you guys caught us

715
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:44,736
in route to a gentleman's club.

716
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,203
Are you sure you're
gonna get in,

717
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,684
'cause I don't see
any gentlemen here.

718
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:52,437
Becky, I-I uh... I know
it's a little on the nose

719
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:53,469
that I'm going to strip club

720
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,571
the night before my wedding,

721
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,103
but you know, I'm fine with it

722
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:57,436
because the commitment
we're about to make,

723
00:26:57,437 --> 00:26:58,668
that's what it's about.
Look... you're okay.

724
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,269
I want you to see me,
warts and all,

725
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,336
and yeah I'm going
to a strip club...

726
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:02,204
Becky's not here.

727
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,570
She's not here. Okay?

728
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,138
And nobody blames the
dude with the blindfold,

729
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:06,369
so relax.

730
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,704
I am also not really into this.

731
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:09,270
Yeah, you weren't blindfolded,

732
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:10,669
so that's hard to believe.

733
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,804
Where's your mascot?
Sick. She's dead.

734
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:15,769
Is that what we call Kate where is Katie?
She is dead. Sick.

735
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:17,071
Would you ladies be interested

736
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:19,537
in joining our little soiree?

737
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,169
That was not part
of the deal, Trevor.

738
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,403
No, because we gave up
strip clubs for lent, so...

739
00:27:23,404 --> 00:27:25,436
And we have
bridesmaid's duties...

740
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,702
In the middle of the night?

741
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:27,568
That's interesting.

742
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:28,471
All right. Let's go.

743
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:29,803
Limo's waiting.

744
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:30,570
I'll text you.

745
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:31,736
Please don't.

746
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:33,204
Um, if you guys
do see Katie though,

747
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:35,235
let her know that I have pot,

748
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,801
'cause we had talked
about it at the thing,

749
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:39,341
but there were adults...
Your limo's waiting.

750
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:45,705
Oh hey, Clyde...

751
00:27:47,703 --> 00:27:51,135
I just wanted to tell you that

752
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,769
if you strike out
with the pros,

753
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,672
you know you can
always call me, right?

754
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,069
Right.

755
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,103
Well... I deleted your number.

756
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:04,902
Right.

757
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:10,102
That's impressive.

758
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:11,303
In the middle of
all this chaos,

759
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,135
you had time for a crotch rub?

760
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:14,835
Paid off, though!

761
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,068
Ba-bam!

762
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:21,069
Oh, my god!

763
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,334
You guys?

764
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:25,102
I know I'm on
drugs, but I swear,

765
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,803
that room you
just pushed me into?

766
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,201
It was moving.

767
00:28:28,202 --> 00:28:32,269
we don't need not
wookie tokie

768
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,334
Objectifying?

769
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:34,567
We're paying their rent!

770
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:35,667
I feel like I'm
travelling backwards.

771
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:36,501
Can I take the blindfold off?

772
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:38,499
Joe's never...
you've never been

773
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,600
to a strip club, have you?

774
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:40,369
Have I been to a strip club?

775
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,169
Yes.

776
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:42,201
You have.

777
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:42,301
Joe's never been
to a strip club.

778
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:44,201
I have been.

779
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:45,581
Hence why I know
that for a fact,

780
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:47,499
once you get in there.

781
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,566
You never know what
exactly to do.

782
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:49,734
It's weird getting a lap dance

783
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:50,835
in front of other people.

784
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:52,134
Oh, my god.

785
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,133
There's no reason
to get outraged

786
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:54,100
and use words like "hence."

787
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:55,101
I'm with Joe on this one.

788
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,769
Oh. Dale,

789
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,533
I will not let you kill fun
on your own bachelor party.

790
00:28:58,534 --> 00:28:59,802
This is like negative fun.

791
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:01,233
You don't get it.

792
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:02,599
When you meet the right girl,

793
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,040
you don't do anything
to screw it up.

794
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:05,132
You're adorable.

795
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:06,100
Uh, I beg to differ.

796
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:08,533
I met the right girl, I did
everything to screw it up.

797
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:10,500
So why don't you
do something about it?

798
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,768
Like apologize?

799
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:14,101
Well, never got the chance.

800
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:16,833
Oh, I smell a new profile pic.

801
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,833
You know what I want to smell?

802
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:20,114
I want to smell
that burning bush

803
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,700
I want to smell that
fucking red snapper,

804
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:24,067
what's her name?

805
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:24,666
Is he talking
about Katie again?

806
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,800
Katie'd be like shooting
a helpless animal.

807
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:27,501
Exactly.

808
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:29,499
Guys... Joe has a decade-long

809
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,499
hard-on for the prom
queen, so take it easy.

810
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,466
Oh, what about
the maid of honor?

811
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:33,300
I'll take her down, then.

812
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:36,167
Mm... It's not a good idea.

813
00:29:36,168 --> 00:29:37,166
Why, what do you mean?

814
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,434
So you know how there are
like serial killers,

815
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:41,067
and then there's
Hannibal Lector?

816
00:29:41,068 --> 00:29:42,133
Yeah?

817
00:29:42,134 --> 00:29:45,400
There are girls,
and there's Regan.

818
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:48,133
Hide it.

819
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:49,766
Hide it in the bag.

820
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:52,566
After tonight, no more coke.

821
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,100
None. No more coke.

822
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,133
I'm having like one of those

823
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:56,666
moments of clarity right now.

824
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:57,765
Yeah.

825
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:58,599
You know what I'm saying?

826
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,732
Yeah.

827
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:00,532
Where is this
Melissa chick, Regan?

828
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,631
I'm calling her.

829
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:02,799
I've got it
under control, okay?

830
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,099
Go back to your
little intervention.

831
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,831
It's not an intervention.

832
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:05,699
We're gonna get a dress.

833
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,331
A whole new dress!

834
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:08,731
What are you talking about?

835
00:30:08,732 --> 00:30:09,666
Why don't we
fix this dreThat's a great idea!

836
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:10,701
Hey, Melissa!

837
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:13,465
Hi.

838
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:15,667
Yeah, we're out... we're just
outside the bridal shop.

839
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:16,733
Melissa!

840
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:18,168
Melissa!

841
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,298
Hello.

842
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:22,364
Oh, look. Look.

843
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:23,633
It's the maid of honor from hell

844
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:25,331
that has landed on my doorstep.

845
00:30:25,332 --> 00:30:26,732
No, I'd much rather
be here with you

846
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,499
and your skanky friends

847
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,364
than maybe getting
touched by my husband

848
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:31,267
Thanks. I can't wait.

849
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,332
Chill out.

850
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,700
You're beautiful.

851
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:39,632
Okay. You're being nice,
and it's scaring me. Stop.

852
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:40,833
What do you need?

853
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,831
Well, our lovely bride decided

854
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:44,466
she didn't want
to wear her dress.

855
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,465
I'm sorry.

856
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:46,663
I was just in my brain,

857
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:47,985
and I was just
really hurting you.

858
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,597
What did you just say?

859
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,436
Ba-bam!

860
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:56,565
If I am still working in retail

861
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:59,798
by the time I'm 40,
I will kill myself.

862
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:03,330
I know you guys think I'm
joking, but I'm not.

863
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:06,396
I will take a shotgun,
and I will blow...

864
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,677
Woman... chillax.
my... head off.

865
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:08,766
Please.

866
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:10,064
Seriously, you guys.

867
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:11,197
Okay.

868
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,397
All right.

869
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:13,366
Fun, fun, fun.

870
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:14,697
Oh!

871
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:17,133
This is all I have,

872
00:31:18,132 --> 00:31:20,631
and it's still a
size too small.

873
00:31:20,632 --> 00:31:21,730
Is this pretty?

874
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:22,664
Or is it ugly?

875
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:23,631
It's gorgeous.

876
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,829
It's the dress you wanted

877
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,097
to get married in, ever since
you were a little girl

878
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:27,832
I mean, it would look
so much better on you,

879
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,230
but it's gorgeous!

880
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:30,332
Everyone wants this cut.
I mean, not in this size,

881
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,064
obviously.

882
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:32,764
But this is so popular.

883
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,330
Everybody wants it.

884
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:35,563
No.
Okay, we want it. Yeah.

885
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:36,696
WrapNo. up!

886
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:37,364
Wrap it up. Hang it up.
Pigface!

887
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:38,664
No!

888
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:39,801
Over my dead body.

889
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,696
Regan!

890
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:43,596
Bee!

891
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:44,730
What the fuck?

892
00:31:44,731 --> 00:31:46,330
Come on, that was our solution!

893
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:49,196
This is the problem... Becky
can't wear that dress!

894
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:50,163
Becky can't wear that dress.

895
00:31:50,164 --> 00:31:51,229
What? Okay, listen to me.

896
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,365
This is clearly like some girl

897
00:31:52,366 --> 00:31:53,864
shit that I don't understand,

898
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,331
so may I just be very,
very diplomatic

899
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,196
and say let it fucking go?

900
00:31:58,197 --> 00:31:59,364
No!

901
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:00,863
I'm not gonna
watch Becky Archer

902
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:03,697
walk down the aisle
in my dream dress.

903
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:05,131
I'd rather lick this sidewalk.

904
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,229
Great!

905
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,629
Lick the sidewalk,
then, please.

906
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,063
I'm gonna lick it, too.
Don't be ridiculous.

907
00:32:09,064 --> 00:32:10,064
You don't lick the sidewalk.

908
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:12,166
You lick the sidewalk,
I'll let it go.

909
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:14,725
A little lick.

910
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:15,797
Like a cat lick.

911
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:17,539
Like a cat lick.

912
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:26,429
Ugh.

913
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,129
Be encouraging.

914
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,797
I'm mentally preparing myself.

915
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:32,228
Just do it fast, please.

916
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:33,264
Like you're ripping
off a band-aid

917
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:34,763
Like anal sex.

918
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,464
Becky can't wear that dress.

919
00:32:36,465 --> 00:32:39,163
A-a biased cut would
look awful on her.

920
00:32:39,164 --> 00:32:40,495
It utilizes the
stretch of the fabric

921
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:42,831
in a diagonal direction,
accentuating body lines.

922
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:46,766
It would fit her like a silk
stuffed sausage casing.

923
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:50,731
Rain man?

924
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,595
How did you know all
that stuff, just now?

925
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:56,099
I spent a semester at F.I.T.

926
00:32:58,097 --> 00:32:59,796
- Katie? Katie?
- Yes?

927
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:01,829
Do you know how to sew things?

928
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,564
Oh.

929
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:06,464
Of course I know how to sew.

930
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:09,195
Oh. Okay.

931
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,208
Are you ready to Betsy Ross

932
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:11,609
- the shit out of this dress?
- Yes.

933
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:12,762
Good.

934
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:13,429
This tastes like gasoline.

935
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,695
Good.

936
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:15,495
'Cause you love
the smell of gasoline.

937
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:16,494
It's perfect.

938
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,661
We should get some magic
markers while we're here!

939
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:19,361
Oh, wait.

940
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:20,328
I know a guy who can
get us marijuana.

941
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:21,429
Ted.

942
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,495
Joe.

943
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:23,560
You should throw
that guy a bone.

944
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:24,295
Who, Ted?

945
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:25,395
Joe!

946
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:26,757
I bet he's super good in bed.
What?

947
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:27,761
Yeah.

948
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:28,760
Why would you say that?

949
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,160
Have you ever fucked a guy

950
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:31,194
who like never got
laid in high school?

951
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:32,493
But how would I know that?

952
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,427
Oh, 'cause they're just
really good at it.

953
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:35,693
They're really good at sex,

954
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:36,826
'cause they had to wait
for it for so long.

955
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:38,095
It's like a total
Krakow situation.

956
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:39,495
Krakow?

957
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:41,563
Brian Krakow, from
My So Called Life.

958
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:42,828
Come on.

959
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,395
Okay, listen to me.

960
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:45,796
There are two different
types of guys in bed.

961
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:46,827
Mm-hmm.

962
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:48,127
Number one, Brian Krakow.

963
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:50,762
Didn't have sex 'til
college, super grateful.

964
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:53,361
Literally makes
a home down here,

965
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:55,394
sets up shop, wants
to live in it.

966
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,295
Number two, Jordan Catalano.

967
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:58,593
Won't go near the area.

968
00:33:58,594 --> 00:33:59,459
Terrified of it.

969
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,659
Very good looking, but you
know, not worth the time.

970
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,593
If you ask me-...
What are you doing?

971
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:06,193
Why do you have the baby
out of the garbage bag?

972
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:07,794
I'm matching the thread
color to the dress.

973
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,226
Uh, it's a wedding dress.

974
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,327
I think maybe it's white.

975
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:12,561
Oh, actually... it's ivory.

976
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,760
Actually, it's pearl.

977
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,659
Okay. You know what?

978
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,492
Knowing stuff like that does
not make you guys cool.

979
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:18,453
It makes you... Amazing?

980
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:19,728
Gorgeous?

981
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:20,826
Incredible?

982
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:22,295
God blessed me
with perfect tits.

983
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:24,294
It's only right that
people should know that.

984
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,228
I was gonna say
makes you stupid.

985
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:29,759
This Trevor guy
keeps texting me.

986
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,228
He wants us to go to
that strip club.

987
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:33,295
Oh! Guys, we have to
go to a strip club.

988
00:34:33,296 --> 00:34:34,226
Please?

989
00:34:34,227 --> 00:34:35,392
Guys, it's like 2 a.m.

990
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:36,827
She wakes up in five hours.

991
00:34:36,828 --> 00:34:39,060
Okay. How fast can you sew?

992
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:40,794
It'll be faster if I
had a sewing machine.

993
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:42,261
Oh, my god.

994
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:43,661
You know who could
get us a sewing machine?

995
00:34:43,662 --> 00:34:45,193
Catalano.

996
00:34:45,194 --> 00:34:47,760
No. More like looks like Krakow

997
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:49,293
and treats you like Catalano.

998
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:51,492
free your ming and
the rest will follow...

999
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:54,259
I'm the president
of the United States.

1000
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,525
Totally kidding.

1001
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,693
You want a dance, handsome?

1002
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,827
Oh, I'm-I'm good. Err, uh,
I mean, I'm not-help...

1003
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:01,661
what are the parameters
gonna be, for such a dance?

1004
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:03,727
Jesus Christ almighty.

1005
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:05,259
He said you're not his type.

1006
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,193
Okay, I'm talking
to the retard here.

1007
00:35:07,194 --> 00:35:08,459
Snap!

1008
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,560
Here's twenty dollars.
Leave us alone.

1009
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:13,158
Look, it's just like
taking a woman on a date.

1010
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:17,126
You just have to make her
feel terrible about herself.

1011
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:18,227
Same goes for strippers.

1012
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:19,626
I am so sorry

1013
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:21,793
that he's referring to you
in-in such a manner.

1014
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:23,159
Does it look like
it bothers her?

1015
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,094
She's doesn't give a shit.

1016
00:35:24,095 --> 00:35:25,626
Here you go.

1017
00:35:25,627 --> 00:35:27,426
That was unique and special.

1018
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,125
Thank you very much.

1019
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,061
That was terrible.

1020
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,659
Oh, shit!

1021
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,124
I got a text from Hannibal.

1022
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,758
Looks like some
sluts are on their way.

1023
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,824
Becky's friends are coming here?

1024
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,093
Wait, is Katie with them?

1025
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,191
Yes.

1026
00:35:39,192 --> 00:35:41,124
Relax.
I'm out of here.

1027
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,390
Keep the limo I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Dale, come on.

1028
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,158
I got a table booked downtown.

1029
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:46,524
What are you doing? We've got bottles
Where are you going?

1030
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:47,490
I've got wedding
photos in the morning.

1031
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:48,591
That is a dick move.

1032
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:49,791
This is like a classy place.

1033
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:51,291
I've got a wedding tomorrow!

1034
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:52,525
This is like the
Harvard of strip clubs.

1035
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,758
Hey, Joe. I'm gonna
make sure Lector

1036
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:55,158
brings your drunk
prom queen for you,

1037
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,224
'cause I'm gonna
make it my mission

1038
00:35:56,225 --> 00:35:57,258
to get you in that tonight.

1039
00:35:57,259 --> 00:35:58,592
That's awesome, but I-I-I...

1040
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,591
can we stop referring
to her as a "that"?

1041
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,059
All right. You in, Clyde?

1042
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,394
No, I got something
else going on here.

1043
00:36:06,392 --> 00:36:08,426
No, no, no. No females
without a male escort.

1044
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:09,359
What?

1045
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,589
That's really sexist,
and homophobic,

1046
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,359
because you don't...
you don't know us.

1047
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,656
We could be lesbians.

1048
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:15,657
These are my girlfriends.
What the fuck?

1049
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:16,739
All right. Down the street.

1050
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:17,325
Did you...

1051
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,093
just call us prostitutes?

1052
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,257
Did you just call
us prostitutes?

1053
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:22,192
Down the street.

1054
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,458
Listen, I got a
scholarship to Princeton.

1055
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:27,691
Hey, Dale! Dale, Dale, Dale!

1056
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:29,791
Can you get us in?

1057
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,625
I didn't know you
guys were coming down.

1058
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,691
Place is kind of gross.

1059
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,090
It's okay. They're with me.

1060
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:36,223
Hey, you don't have
to pay for it.

1061
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,292
What is this, misogyny night...
...at Scores?

1062
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:39,325
We can vote.

1063
00:36:39,726 --> 00:36:41,324
I have never voted.

1064
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:42,624
Have fun in there.

1065
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,658
You guys'll fit right in.

1066
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:49,556
Guys... It's in this one!

1067
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,688
It's not even in a
white bag, Katie!

1068
00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:53,725
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1069
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:54,524
Okay.

1070
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,090
We got it. Done.

1071
00:36:57,124 --> 00:36:58,489
What are you doing?

1072
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,589
What are you fucking doing?

1073
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,656
Don't drop it in the garbage.

1074
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:01,724
I'm stepping on it.

1075
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:04,289
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

1076
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,356
Katie!

1077
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,457
Okay! I found it...

1078
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,590
Rock'n'Roll Hoochie Co...

1079
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:12,189
This must be what it feels
like to go to the oscars.

1080
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,455
Ew... it's like Iran in here.

1081
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:14,655
Okay, so I'm gonna
go find the bathroom,

1082
00:37:14,656 --> 00:37:15,790
and I'm gonna clean
off the dress.

1083
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:16,823
Okay, we'll find Clyde.

1084
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:17,945
She's not a stripper, right?

1085
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:20,056
She's on a pole.

1086
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:21,255
Let's rock the red carpet.

1087
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:22,524
Listen, if I'm not
out in five minutes,

1088
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:25,589
you should probably
claim the body.

1089
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,524
I'm serious.

1090
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:37,223
Hey, can I have some money?

1091
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:38,389
No.

1092
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,322
We're waiting
for Gena and Clyde,

1093
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,356
and then we're leaving
Pull this dress up,

1094
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:42,488
you don't work here!

1095
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:43,654
Can I have some money, please?

1096
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:44,824
Yeah, definitely.

1097
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:46,256
Thank you.

1098
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:47,654
They're just all
such beautiful dancers,

1099
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:47,725
I can't pick who
to give money to.

1100
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,156
That's so sweet.

1101
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:51,521
I always ask them
their stories, too.

1102
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,257
'Cause you never know
like where they... Oh.

1103
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:55,156
She's gonna be so happy.

1104
00:37:55,157 --> 00:37:56,521
Her son's gonna
have the gift of sight!

1105
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:57,821
Why don't you ask her
to smoke pot with you?

1106
00:37:57,822 --> 00:37:59,102
Why is that
actually a good idea?

1107
00:37:59,723 --> 00:38:01,121
Is that cool to do?

1108
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:02,320
Please. I need a
break from "that".

1109
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,487
We're not calling her "that".

1110
00:38:03,488 --> 00:38:04,622
We're trying
not to call her "that".

1111
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:06,061
I called her "that" earlier.

1112
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:11,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1113
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:14,523
Your security guy's-the security's...
Thank you.

1114
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:17,687
That was amazing, but
I'm a little bored now.

1115
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:19,788
Hey, is there
anything you can do

1116
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:21,788
to help Joe score with Katie?

1117
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:22,588
No.

1118
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:24,056
Why?

1119
00:38:24,057 --> 00:38:25,322
I'm a completely
powerless figurehead.

1120
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:27,289
I'm like Truman at Geneva.

1121
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,387
You mean Truman at Potsdam?

1122
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:34,455
I think I know what
I'm talking about.

1123
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:37,455
Truman inherited the presidency
because Roosevelt died.

1124
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:39,056
Poor fuck got sworn in,

1125
00:38:39,057 --> 00:38:41,554
flown to Potsdam to deal
with Stalin and Churchill,

1126
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:43,756
figure out what the fuck to do
with post-war Germany

1127
00:38:43,757 --> 00:38:45,320
and all of Europe.

1128
00:38:45,321 --> 00:38:47,454
Geneva conference is
completely different thing.

1129
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:50,221
So I think you meant
Truman at Potsdam.

1130
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:54,221
Oh. I switched it, 'cause
I'm a little drunk.

1131
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:55,353
It wouldn't have
made sense anyway,

1132
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:58,588
because Truman had the trump
card, he had the Bomb.

1133
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:01,394
So really, he was in
control the whole time.

1134
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:09,488
Oh, do you believe in magic?

1135
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,788
Yes, I do. That's... abso-yes.

1136
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:13,420
Do you believe in
a magic vagina?

1137
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:14,021
A magic vagina?

1138
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:16,189
It would bewitch
you with its magic.

1139
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,386
I've been bewitched
by vaginas before.

1140
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:20,721
It's scary, actually.

1141
00:39:20,722 --> 00:39:22,353
I think I might be stupid.

1142
00:39:22,354 --> 00:39:23,788
Why would you say
that about yourself?

1143
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,354
I don't understand anything

1144
00:39:25,355 --> 00:39:27,486
anyone is talking about,
most of the time.

1145
00:39:27,487 --> 00:39:27,623
That has nothing
to do with intelligence.

1146
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:30,287
It's like this...

1147
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:31,754
there's lots of different
kinds of smart,

1148
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:33,154
you know, and you just

1149
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:36,187
have to discover
which smart you are.

1150
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,588
See, I-I don't understand
what you just said.

1151
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,353
That's okay, neither do I.

1152
00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:43,187
Be honest, would you
marry a stripper?

1153
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:48,719
Um... Shh... shh...
shh... shh...

1154
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,354
There's no touching allowed.

1155
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,487
Okay.

1156
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:53,153
Did you know that?

1157
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:56,721
I... did-hadn't really...
We're not allowed to touch.

1158
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,154
Okay. Well, I'm not...

1159
00:39:58,155 --> 00:39:59,454
I mean, my hands
are down. I'm not...

1160
00:39:59,455 --> 00:40:02,186
Mm-mm... But if you
wanted to, you could.

1161
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:05,419
I'm confused. It's not
allowed, but I can?

1162
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,120
If you wanted to
touch me, you could.

1163
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:09,819
I'm gonna give it a shot. Okay.

1164
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,686
Okay.

1165
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:11,788
Just... all right.

1166
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:15,420
Mm-hmm. That's $200.

1167
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:16,420
That's $200?

1168
00:40:16,587 --> 00:40:17,386
Mm-hmm.

1169
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:19,686
That's $200?

1170
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:22,218
Two-zero-zero.

1171
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,621
Okay. Well, I-I mean, I
feel like that's a...

1172
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:29,324
that's a-a pretty good...
deal...

1173
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,589
Oh, Genny.

1174
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:37,428
These guys suck.

1175
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:47,218
Hand full of splooge.

1176
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:48,385
Been there.

1177
00:40:48,386 --> 00:40:49,684
Is it your first night?

1178
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:52,819
No... but pretty rad

1179
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,420
that you think I'm
hot enough to work here.

1180
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:57,353
You okay?

1181
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,684
No. Because...

1182
00:40:58,685 --> 00:41:01,352
my stupid ex-boyfriend's
in the back right now,

1183
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:03,451
getting humped by some skank.

1184
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:04,420
No offense.

1185
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,419
We are skanks.

1186
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:06,073
It's so dumb.

1187
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,751
Like honestly,

1188
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:09,451
I don't even know why I'm
freaking out about it.

1189
00:41:09,452 --> 00:41:11,116
I should be fixing the dress,
not obsessing over him,

1190
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:13,451
Look, the only reason why Romeo
is back there is because

1191
00:41:13,452 --> 00:41:15,119
he knows he's not
getting laid tonight.

1192
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,284
It's true.

1193
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:18,365
Yeah. I mean, if he thought
he had a chance with you,

1194
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,752
he would be all over your ass,

1195
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:23,252
like a fat kid eating cake.

1196
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:24,385
Thanks.

1197
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:25,486
Yeah. Men are all
sorts of fucked.

1198
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:27,318
They feel insecure
for one second

1199
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,052
and they need
to go feel powerful

1200
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,184
for a couple of hours.

1201
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:31,351
Women feel shitty
about themselves

1202
00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:33,116
and they just go
cry in the bathroom.

1203
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:33,787
Yeah.

1204
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,584
Or they stab each
other in the back.

1205
00:41:38,585 --> 00:41:39,752
Yeah, I guess
there's that, too.

1206
00:41:39,753 --> 00:41:41,251
Yeah.

1207
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:42,551
Oh, that's good.

1208
00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:45,683
Yeah.

1209
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:46,817
I should like,
do this more often,

1210
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:48,718
come to these
bathrooms, you know.

1211
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,217
So much cheaper than going
to a fucking therapist.

1212
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:54,183
Yeah!

1213
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:55,418
All right!

1214
00:41:55,419 --> 00:41:56,653
That's great. Thank you.

1215
00:41:58,651 --> 00:42:00,385
Regan!

1216
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:03,517
Whoa, we're still having...
What is that?

1217
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:03,518
I need to talk
to her for a second.

1218
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:05,682
Where's Katie?

1219
00:42:05,683 --> 00:42:07,050
I don't know. This place
is like a fucking maze.

1220
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:07,783
Okay. Well, we gotta
get out of here

1221
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:08,718
if we're ever gonna...
We need to find Clyde...

1222
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,316
No to get the sewing machine.

1223
00:42:11,317 --> 00:42:12,398
No, it's a change of plans.

1224
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,551
Do you think they'd
let me work here,

1225
00:42:16,552 --> 00:42:18,383
if I take my clothes off?

1226
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:20,249
Oh, my god. You let her smoke pot?

1227
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,482
I can't control her.

1228
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:22,550
You can't control her.

1229
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:24,083
That's hilarious.

1230
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:24,751
Why are you talking about
me like I'm not here?

1231
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:26,184
I'm calling Becky,

1232
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:27,315
and I'm telling her
about the dress,

1233
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:28,548
'cause I can't
handle this anymore.

1234
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:29,782
Hah! So you can be
the big fucking hero?

1235
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:31,148
No! I'm the only
one doing anything!

1236
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:32,316
You don't handle shit!

1237
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:33,417
I handle shit.

1238
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:35,217
and I handle shit...
What's the plan, Gena?

1239
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:36,517
It doesn't matter!

1240
00:42:36,518 --> 00:42:38,081
I'm just telling her
about the fucking dress.

1241
00:42:38,082 --> 00:42:38,715
What happens when all the
fucking responsibility

1242
00:42:38,716 --> 00:42:39,617
comes down on you?
You're gonna call me...

1243
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:41,115
No.

1244
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:41,816
Yeah, you are.

1245
00:42:41,817 --> 00:42:44,115
You're gonna call me, and
I'll fucking handle it

1246
00:42:44,116 --> 00:42:45,315
Just like I handled
your abortion,

1247
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:46,677
because I had to
fucking drive you.

1248
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:56,483
You guys had an
abortion without me?

1249
00:42:56,484 --> 00:42:56,984
Okay.

1250
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:57,704
I'm sorry.
No.

1251
00:42:58,384 --> 00:42:59,749
Gena, stop.

1252
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,250
What is that shit?

1253
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:02,718
I-I didn't even get to come?

1254
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:05,081
Clyde, I need you to help me.

1255
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:05,784
Security!

1256
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:07,216
Clyde! Come on.

1257
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,616
No, he can't leave.
He owes me $200.

1258
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:10,716
See this?

1259
00:43:10,717 --> 00:43:12,049
It's worth a lot
of money, okay?

1260
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,549
So don't blow it
all in one place.

1261
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:18,215
See you later.

1262
00:43:18,216 --> 00:43:19,215
Whatever.

1263
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,449
Wait, Gena!

1264
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,815
Fuck you!

1265
00:43:23,816 --> 00:43:25,482
You're a bad-ass.

1266
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:26,549
Wait! No, no, no, no.

1267
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,048
Oh, no.

1268
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:30,281
We're not getting on
the floor tonight. Nope.

1269
00:43:30,282 --> 00:43:32,247
We're going...
Do I still look okay?

1270
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:33,417
We're going home now, okay?

1271
00:43:33,418 --> 00:43:35,082
She really goes
from 60 to zero.

1272
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,115
No, you're not going home.

1273
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,649
You said you needed a break.

1274
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,547
That was before.
You're not going home.

1275
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:39,749
Joe, take Katie home.

1276
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,315
Whoa. Who is Joe?

1277
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:42,047
He's right behind you.

1278
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:42,613
I'm Joe.

1279
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:43,781
Hello.

1280
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:44,714
Here's what's happening.

1281
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:46,613
You're staying with
me, call your friend,

1282
00:43:46,614 --> 00:43:48,814
as soon as she picks up
I'll take you right to her.

1283
00:43:48,815 --> 00:43:49,780
The most efficient
way of handling it.

1284
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:51,748
Wait, wait, wait. Um... Sorry.

1285
00:43:51,749 --> 00:43:55,580
Think I'm gonna be sick...
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1286
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:56,482
She's good!
I'm good.

1287
00:43:57,314 --> 00:43:58,714
Okay.

1288
00:43:58,715 --> 00:44:00,815
Aw... Young love.

1289
00:44:00,816 --> 00:44:01,649
All right. Okay.

1290
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,714
Okay.

1291
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:04,113
You wanna throw up?

1292
00:44:04,114 --> 00:44:04,714
Here, let me take
you to throw up.

1293
00:44:04,715 --> 00:44:05,646
Uh-uh, I'm good.

1294
00:44:05,647 --> 00:44:06,481
No, come on. Let's go.

1295
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:07,781
Joe, come here.

1296
00:44:07,782 --> 00:44:09,146
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

1297
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:09,747
I'm trying to get
you alone with her.

1298
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:10,616
She's GTG, man.

1299
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:12,213
What's GTG again?

1300
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:13,046
Good to go!

1301
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:14,081
She's good to go!

1302
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:15,815
Take her home and slip it in.

1303
00:44:15,816 --> 00:44:17,147
I'm not gonna slip it in.

1304
00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:18,481
She is wasted,
that'd be like rape.

1305
00:44:18,482 --> 00:44:20,047
Slipping it in to a girl

1306
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:21,313
that's about to pass out...?

1307
00:44:21,314 --> 00:44:22,649
I'm telling you, take these.

1308
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,380
That'll help.

1309
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:25,482
What are these? Are these...

1310
00:44:25,483 --> 00:44:27,415
dude, are these
date rape drugs?

1311
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,856
They're fucking xanax,
dude, for you.

1312
00:44:29,315 --> 00:44:30,275
You're fucking paranoid.

1313
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:31,349
You smoked too much.

1314
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,047
Would you relax?

1315
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,347
What am I doing?

1316
00:44:37,149 --> 00:44:38,079
All right.

1317
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,815
I like to see you man up.

1318
00:44:38,816 --> 00:44:41,448
Now, do you want Regan,
or do you want Katie?

1319
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:43,448
You can take her.

1320
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:45,478
Katie's hotter.

1321
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:46,315
Yeah. Good call.

1322
00:44:47,314 --> 00:44:47,314
Look, she's throwing
up right now,

1323
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:49,214
that's not so hot.

1324
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:51,247
What is wrong with you?

1325
00:44:51,248 --> 00:44:51,815
I don't know.

1326
00:44:53,514 --> 00:44:54,514
Hey.

1327
00:44:54,515 --> 00:44:55,115
Thank you, Joe.

1328
00:44:55,248 --> 00:44:56,147
All good?

1329
00:44:56,148 --> 00:44:58,146
All right. Yeah. Yeah.

1330
00:44:58,147 --> 00:44:58,679
so Joe's going with Katie...
You're going with Joe.

1331
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,513
Great. Yeah.

1332
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:01,647
We're GTG, we're good to go.

1333
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:02,945
Okay. Perfect

1334
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:05,414
GTG?

1335
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:06,412
Yeah, GTG what?

1336
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:07,379
Why you stealin' my shit?

1337
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,414
I didn't hear you say that.

1338
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:09,779
That's my line.

1339
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,216
This is the best night
of my life, you guys!

1340
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:16,213
How can you not
have a metro card?

1341
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,746
Uh, because I live
in Los Angeles?

1342
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:21,712
Yeah, but you've been
here for like a day.

1343
00:45:21,713 --> 00:45:24,312
Thank you, Gena, for
helping me get out of

1344
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:26,613
that sticky situation
with that wasted stripper

1345
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:28,312
that I could not pay for.

1346
00:45:28,313 --> 00:45:29,377
Oh, you're so welcome, Clyde.

1347
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:30,577
Are you kidding?

1348
00:45:30,578 --> 00:45:31,680
I could have paid
for the stripper,

1349
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:34,182
if you hadn't taken my wallet.

1350
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:38,059
How long are you gonna

1351
00:45:38,247 --> 00:45:39,445
pretend to be mad at me, Gena?

1352
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:40,645
It's starting to
hurt my feelings.

1353
00:45:40,646 --> 00:45:41,614
Listen to me.

1354
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:44,179
I've got like mere hours

1355
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,579
to get this dress
fixed and cleaned,

1356
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,547
and make sure nothing
else happens to it,

1357
00:45:48,548 --> 00:45:51,678
so I am so sorry, Clyde,
that your feelings are

1358
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:52,711
not at the top of my list

1359
00:45:52,712 --> 00:45:54,645
of things to give a shit about.

1360
00:45:54,646 --> 00:45:56,779
Wow, so you're
actually mad at me.

1361
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,717
That's interesting.

1362
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:06,612
You know what...
You got pregnant a long time

1363
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:08,411
- years ago.

1364
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:10,244
And I felt bad
about it ever since.

1365
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:11,525
And you know,
there's this thing,

1366
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:15,079
it's called life, and we
have to get on with it.

1367
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,611
We got pregnant.

1368
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:18,079
I took care of it.

1369
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,312
You made mix tapes about it.

1370
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:21,512
I-I was 18.

1371
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:22,812
I was 15.

1372
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,618
You were 16, and
we were in love.

1373
00:46:31,612 --> 00:46:33,045
Remember Fast Times?

1374
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:33,813
Fast Times?

1375
00:46:33,814 --> 00:46:35,177
You remember that movie?

1376
00:46:35,178 --> 00:46:36,378
Do you remember
who the bad guy was?

1377
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:37,712
It was Damone.

1378
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:42,110
The asshole didn't show
up for the appointment.

1379
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:42,779
That's you, mother fucker.

1380
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,544
I am not I am not Damone!

1381
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:46,612
I'm not Damone!

1382
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:48,931
I can't believe you cannot
see that you are Damone.

1383
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:51,249
Don't call me... dude, don't
call me fucking Damone...

1384
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:55,476
What do you want me
to do about it now?

1385
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:57,409
I just want you to
help me fix the dress.

1386
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,645
I don't want to
have this conversation.

1387
00:46:58,646 --> 00:47:00,683
I just want to fix the dress.

1388
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:09,044
And chemo when you're 12 sucks.

1389
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:09,712
Yeah, it's gotta suck.

1390
00:47:09,713 --> 00:47:12,445
I mean, 12 sucks in general,

1391
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:16,043
especially when you're a girl...
That's when it happens.

1392
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:18,244
When what, when what happens?

1393
00:47:18,245 --> 00:47:20,410
You start hating yourself.

1394
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:22,644
Ah, I can't believe
Gena isn't texting me back!

1395
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:23,642
Hey, you know what?

1396
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:24,576
I got an idea.

1397
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:25,477
Why don't you just relax?

1398
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:27,043
Put the phone away.

1399
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,543
Doesn't sound like your
friend needs you, anyway.

1400
00:47:28,544 --> 00:47:29,543
No, this was a mistake.

1401
00:47:29,544 --> 00:47:30,278
I gotta go.

1402
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:31,376
No-no-no-no.

1403
00:47:31,377 --> 00:47:33,077
You're not going.
Stay. Come on.

1404
00:47:33,078 --> 00:47:34,211
I want to hear about this.
Why do you start to hate yourself?

1405
00:47:34,744 --> 00:47:37,675
'Cause, I, I don't know.

1406
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:38,757
Uh, you wouldn't understand

1407
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:42,771
Well, I think,

1408
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:43,991
I think you're unhappy

1409
00:47:44,144 --> 00:47:45,374
and you have no reason to be,

1410
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,936
and that's what makes
you hate yourself.

1411
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:49,543
Let me guess, psych major.

1412
00:47:49,544 --> 00:47:51,711
Psych major with a
lucrative advertising job.

1413
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:53,576
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

1414
00:47:53,577 --> 00:47:55,142
Belittle me.

1415
00:47:55,143 --> 00:47:56,244
Is that what you
do to your boyfriend?

1416
00:47:56,245 --> 00:47:58,610
Does that work for him?

1417
00:47:58,611 --> 00:47:59,543
Not really.

1418
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,576
I shouldn't have brought it up.

1419
00:48:01,577 --> 00:48:03,243
Yeah, but you did.

1420
00:48:03,244 --> 00:48:05,142
So probably I would tell
you that you're beautiful

1421
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:07,608
and what you're doing with
retarded kids is amazing.

1422
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:08,310
They have cancer.

1423
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:09,309
Whatever.

1424
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,777
I like to compliment a woman
because she deserves it,

1425
00:48:11,778 --> 00:48:13,276
not because
she needs attention.

1426
00:48:15,411 --> 00:48:16,709
I don't need attention.

1427
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,809
Ooh, got off some steam there.

1428
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,540
You're mad.

1429
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:20,408
I'm not mad.

1430
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:21,376
Are you kidding me?

1431
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:24,108
You're fucking livid.

1432
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,408
Oh, don't do that.

1433
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:27,407
Just want to give
you what you want.

1434
00:48:29,144 --> 00:48:30,742
What do I want?

1435
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:32,544
You want somebody to
put you in your place.

1436
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:34,742
Where's that?

1437
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:36,175
Where do you want it?

1438
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:39,574
Ah! Harder!

1439
00:48:39,575 --> 00:48:42,609
Uh, harder!

1440
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:46,541
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up.

1441
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:48,375
Yeah, you shut the fuck up.

1442
00:48:48,376 --> 00:48:55,275
Yeah, shut the fuck up cunt.

1443
00:48:57,042 --> 00:49:00,341
Shit! Shit, shit.

1444
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:02,341
Fuck. Shit, shit.

1445
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:03,409
Hey.

1446
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,341
Hey, this is Becks.

1447
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,507
Can you come to my room?

1448
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:06,473
Oh yeah.
I'm not doing anything.

1449
00:49:06,474 --> 00:49:07,640
We need to talk.

1450
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:08,740
Yeah, I'll be
there in a minute.

1451
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:09,640
Uh, give me a couple minutes.

1452
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:10,508
Okay.

1453
00:49:10,509 --> 00:49:11,341
Okay.

1454
00:49:11,342 --> 00:49:11,342
Bye.

1455
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:12,577
Bye.

1456
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:17,277
Don't cum on my dress.

1457
00:49:19,275 --> 00:49:20,555
I can't believe
we're doing this.

1458
00:49:20,776 --> 00:49:22,574
I can't believe I
gave all my coke

1459
00:49:22,575 --> 00:49:24,140
to your filthy stripper.

1460
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:26,340
Do me a favor and
don't mention that

1461
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:27,609
in your recap of the evening.

1462
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:30,540
Aw, that's my
favorite part, though.

1463
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:31,808
Clyde?

1464
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:33,173
Hey, mom.

1465
00:49:33,174 --> 00:49:34,408
I thought you
were at a wedding.

1466
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:36,041
You remember...?

1467
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:37,241
Gena?

1468
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:38,475
I don't think you've eaten

1469
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,673
since the last time I saw you.

1470
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:42,106
We need your help.

1471
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:43,106
Yeah.

1472
00:49:44,174 --> 00:49:46,174
Oh my Lord.

1473
00:49:46,175 --> 00:49:47,774
It's a really long story

1474
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,444
without much of a payoff, so...

1475
00:49:51,442 --> 00:49:52,472
I've seen worse.

1476
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:53,540
When do you need it?

1477
00:49:53,541 --> 00:49:54,707
Three hours.

1478
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:57,572
It's a miracle you need, not me.

1479
00:49:57,573 --> 00:50:00,239
Sheila, you made every
one of the costumes

1480
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
for all the schools plays

1481
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:04,073
and you made my prom
dress from scratch!

1482
00:50:04,074 --> 00:50:05,643
You can do it.

1483
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:11,507
Clyde, make us some
coffee and food.

1484
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,306
Gena?

1485
00:50:12,307 --> 00:50:13,206
Yeah?

1486
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:16,744
I'll get you some pants.

1487
00:50:19,741 --> 00:50:23,110
Why are doors so heavy
in this place? Uh-oh.

1488
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,441
I don't think
this is your room.

1489
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:28,472
No, no.

1490
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:30,240
This is definitely my room.

1491
00:50:30,241 --> 00:50:32,409
But somebody has moved
the furniture around.

1492
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:36,339
They put a pool right in
the middle of my room.

1493
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,314
This is fucking fantastic!

1494
00:50:45,307 --> 00:50:46,407
Wait, are you coming?

1495
00:50:46,408 --> 00:50:48,677
Yeah. I am.

1496
00:50:52,673 --> 00:50:54,805
Oh!

1497
00:50:54,806 --> 00:50:56,506
It's beautiful!

1498
00:50:56,507 --> 00:50:57,706
You okay?

1499
00:50:57,707 --> 00:50:59,239
It's beautiful.

1500
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,680
Moments like these, I think to myself,
my parents have no idea

1501
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:02,647
where I am right now.

1502
00:51:04,472 --> 00:51:05,338
Ah.

1503
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,104
I'm so awake now.

1504
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,539
Watch me do a handstand!

1505
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,277
Be careful, it's
three feet deep.

1506
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:17,073
You're seriously making
pancakes right now?

1507
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:18,606
I am.

1508
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:21,506
Yours has a sad face made
out of chocolate chips,

1509
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:26,773
because the world is an asshole
and it's gonna get you.

1510
00:51:27,772 --> 00:51:30,738
Why are you on your phone
at 4.30 in the a.m.?

1511
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:35,476
Don't worry about it, you know?

1512
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:44,771
And... I am totally tagging
you in that photo.

1513
00:51:44,772 --> 00:51:47,707
You totally stalk me
online, don't you?

1514
00:51:49,705 --> 00:51:50,641
Maybe.

1515
00:51:53,638 --> 00:51:54,142
Sometimes.

1516
00:51:57,139 --> 00:51:58,540
Weekly.

1517
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:00,737
Pervert.

1518
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:02,737
Who are you calling?

1519
00:52:02,738 --> 00:52:03,537
Who are you calling?

1520
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:04,638
You're so nosy.

1521
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,470
I'm calling my friend's dealer,
okay, so I can get some

1522
00:52:08,471 --> 00:52:10,772
cocaine for tonight, so
I can make it through.

1523
00:52:10,773 --> 00:52:13,436
Give me my phone back.

1524
00:52:13,437 --> 00:52:14,770
Give it back to me.

1525
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:16,636
Give it to me.

1526
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:17,569
What are you doing?

1527
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,670
Why did you do that?!

1528
00:52:18,671 --> 00:52:20,070
Oh my God!

1529
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:21,402
I can't believe that
you just did that!

1530
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:22,238
Believe it.

1531
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,138
Why did you do that?

1532
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:26,310
It's not cute anymore, Gen.

1533
00:52:45,304 --> 00:52:46,737
Hey.

1534
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:49,240
What's up?

1535
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:52,640
I think we need to talk.

1536
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:59,138
I wanted to... Look, Beck...
What? What?

1537
00:53:00,137 --> 00:53:01,069
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1538
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,240
Oh, no. You go first.

1539
00:53:05,237 --> 00:53:07,536
I called you 'cause
I feel really bad

1540
00:53:07,537 --> 00:53:09,035
about what happened earlier.

1541
00:53:10,138 --> 00:53:12,168
I overreacted.

1542
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:14,503
Emotions were
running really high.

1543
00:53:14,504 --> 00:53:16,068
You've been a trooper.

1544
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:18,270
And I know that this
Maid of honor stuff

1545
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:20,568
must have been, like,
really hard for you.

1546
00:53:20,569 --> 00:53:22,567
Yeah, but I'm really
happy for you.

1547
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:24,206
Regan.

1548
00:53:28,202 --> 00:53:30,636
I shouldn't have
blown up like that.

1549
00:53:30,637 --> 00:53:32,504
I mean, I wanted
to see the stripper

1550
00:53:32,505 --> 00:53:34,036
go the full thing.

1551
00:53:34,037 --> 00:53:35,069
Yeah.

1552
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:39,734
It would've been great to
see one more dick before,

1553
00:53:39,735 --> 00:53:45,336
before I see Dale's for the
rest of my life, but...

1554
00:53:45,337 --> 00:53:46,601
you've just done so much work

1555
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,703
for this wedding, just
put your own shit

1556
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:52,036
aside in order
to do everything.

1557
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:54,701
So..

1558
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:56,305
thank you.

1559
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,304
I have to pee.

1560
00:54:04,301 --> 00:54:07,467
Oh, '94 talent show.

1561
00:54:07,468 --> 00:54:10,368
Your leotards are phenomenal.

1562
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:11,690
I won that shit
every single year,

1563
00:54:11,703 --> 00:54:12,768
right?

1564
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:14,135
Yeah, but '94 was special.

1565
00:54:14,136 --> 00:54:15,635
That was the year
you got a bra.

1566
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:17,568
Which you stole.

1567
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:19,335
I could find it if
I looked for it.

1568
00:54:19,336 --> 00:54:21,669
Please do not do that.

1569
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:24,947
You know what was
great about us?

1570
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:28,770
What?

1571
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:31,406
We were friends.

1572
00:54:34,402 --> 00:54:37,636
Everyone else, they
had so much ...drama.

1573
00:54:38,635 --> 00:54:39,770
But we were like...

1574
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:42,408
We were friends.

1575
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:43,367
Yeah.

1576
00:54:43,368 --> 00:54:44,167
Yeah.

1577
00:54:46,734 --> 00:54:47,733
What happened?

1578
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:52,467
I mean, I kinda needed you
to drive me that day.

1579
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:57,703
I needed you to go with me
and you didn't show up.

1580
00:54:58,702 --> 00:55:00,100
I couldn't.

1581
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:01,641
Why couldn't you?

1582
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:09,380
I was too sad.

1583
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:22,666
This is awesome.

1584
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:26,399
Did I puke on you?

1585
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,800
No. Well, yeah.

1586
00:55:27,801 --> 00:55:28,799
Not directly.

1587
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,799
You puked on Regan, though.

1588
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,298
Okay, once, I was so stoned,

1589
00:55:33,299 --> 00:55:34,459
I thought I was in an episode

1590
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:36,099
of 90210

1591
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,499
and I kept yelling, "Dylan!"

1592
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,133
That's fucking awesome.

1593
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:42,365
I got so fucked up
once off 'shrooms

1594
00:55:42,366 --> 00:55:44,433
that I started a
fight club with my cats.

1595
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:45,700
Okay, okay.

1596
00:55:45,701 --> 00:55:49,533
I once got so wrecked
that I woke up naked

1597
00:55:49,534 --> 00:55:52,199
next to a hamburger
and I was like,

1598
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,640
did I just have
sex with a hamburger?

1599
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,298
Good for that hamburger.

1600
00:55:56,299 --> 00:55:59,664
Okay, once I slit my wrist
with a broken bottle.

1601
00:55:59,665 --> 00:56:00,165
Holy shit.

1602
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:01,464
Yeah.

1603
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:02,264
When did that happen?

1604
00:56:02,265 --> 00:56:03,270
Like a year ago.

1605
00:56:07,266 --> 00:56:09,167
I sh-shouldn't
have told you that.

1606
00:56:09,168 --> 00:56:10,199
No, no.

1607
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,733
You can say stuff like that.

1608
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:13,196
No, no, I, it was an accident.

1609
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:15,299
I, really, I party too hard.

1610
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,297
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

1611
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:27,532
I'm sorry, that, I, I
shouldn't have done that.

1612
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:28,634
No.

1613
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:31,164
So, Genny, I think it's time

1614
00:56:31,165 --> 00:56:32,530
we have a serious conversation.

1615
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:33,535
You look different.

1616
00:56:36,532 --> 00:56:38,766
I got you to smile.

1617
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,199
How many things

1618
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:42,533
do you need to show
me in your closet?

1619
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:44,499
This is getting
a little strange.

1620
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,231
Oh, wait a second.

1621
00:56:46,232 --> 00:56:47,497
Oh my God.

1622
00:56:47,498 --> 00:56:48,304
What is that?

1623
00:56:53,299 --> 00:56:54,774
You are going to find out.

1624
00:57:05,264 --> 00:57:07,064
Oh my God.

1625
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:11,364
When I wake up

1626
00:57:11,365 --> 00:57:13,197
well I know I'm gonna be

1627
00:57:13,198 --> 00:57:16,765
I'm going be the man who
wakes up next to you

1628
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,397
when I go out,
Yeah I know I'm gonna be

1629
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:24,096
I'm gonn be the man
who goes along with you

1630
00:57:24,097 --> 00:57:26,533
If I get drunk, well I know I'm gonna be

1631
00:57:27,532 --> 00:57:29,465
I'm gonna be the man who
get's drunk next to you

1632
00:57:29,466 --> 00:57:32,164
Can you turn this off

1633
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:34,664
And if I haver,
hey I know I'm gonna be

1634
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,063
Genny?

1635
00:57:39,064 --> 00:57:40,464
But I would walk 500 miles

1636
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:45,362
Don't call me that Genny

1637
00:57:45,363 --> 00:57:48,596
Nobody calls me that anymore, okay?
Don't.

1638
00:57:56,296 --> 00:57:57,763
Genny

1639
00:57:57,764 --> 00:58:00,396
I'm gonna be the man
who's working hard for you

1640
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:05,597
And when the money comes
in for the work I do

1641
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:07,662
I'll pass almost
every penny on to you

1642
00:58:07,663 --> 00:58:11,661
When I come home,
Oh I know I'm gonna be

1643
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:15,163
I'm gonna be the man
who come back home to you

1644
00:58:15,164 --> 00:58:18,562
And if I grow old
well I know I'm gonna be

1645
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:22,596
I'm gonna be the man
who's growing old with you

1646
00:58:22,597 --> 00:58:25,696
But I would walk 500 miles

1647
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:29,628
And I would walk 500 more

1648
00:58:29,629 --> 00:58:34,030
Just to be the man
who walks a thousand miles

1649
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:36,661
To fall down at your door

1650
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:40,396
Da d-da da, da d-da,
da d-da, da d-da

1651
00:58:40,397 --> 00:58:44,061
Da-da-da dun-diddle
un-diddle un-diddle a dada

1652
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,629
Da d-da da, da d-da,
da d-da, da d-da

1653
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,590
Da-da-da dun-diddle
un-diddle un-diddle a dada

1654
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:51,396
You know what?

1655
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:52,495
I'm so sorry.

1656
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:54,431
Um, w-what if

1657
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,562
we did this another night?

1658
00:58:57,563 --> 00:58:58,727
Well, why?

1659
00:58:58,728 --> 00:59:01,295
I just, my dick is really
cold right now and...

1660
00:59:01,296 --> 00:59:02,396
Come on.

1661
00:59:02,397 --> 00:59:03,527
I'm giving you what you want,

1662
00:59:03,528 --> 00:59:04,461
so let's just get it over with.
No, I... Katie, please.

1663
00:59:05,363 --> 00:59:08,561
I just, I can't. I...
But why not?

1664
00:59:08,562 --> 00:59:09,529
You're drunk and that's fine.

1665
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,061
You've been drunk all night

1666
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:13,796
and I don't want y-I'm drunk,
there's drunk going on,

1667
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:15,162
and it just doesn't,

1668
00:59:15,163 --> 00:59:17,123
I don't like the way it's happened.
I'm so stupid.

1669
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,195
No, no, no.

1670
00:59:18,196 --> 00:59:21,493
I like you s-Katie,
I like you so much.

1671
00:59:21,494 --> 00:59:22,660
Then why don't you
want to have sex?

1672
00:59:22,661 --> 00:59:23,726
Why don't you come
back with me?

1673
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:24,760
'Cause I like you.

1674
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,529
That's what I'm telling you.

1675
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:29,028
It does-this, this is,
this, hopefully, will...

1676
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:31,059
it just doesn't... I
don't like the way it's

1677
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,027
happened right now. It's not...

1678
00:59:32,028 --> 00:59:33,559
But I'm just telling
you that I don't care.

1679
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,429
Katie, that's fine.

1680
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,560
I, I do, though.

1681
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:38,793
It's just, it's not fair to me.

1682
00:59:38,794 --> 00:59:41,427
I don't know what you're
talking about right now.

1683
00:59:41,428 --> 00:59:43,694
Do you even care that it's me?

1684
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:48,228
I mean, do you even know... Fuck

1685
00:59:48,229 --> 00:59:50,301
Do you even know my name?

1686
00:59:56,295 --> 00:59:57,261
But wait, I do,

1687
01:00:03,762 --> 01:00:05,626
Bob?

1688
01:00:05,627 --> 01:00:06,362
Starts with a 'b'?

1689
01:00:07,361 --> 01:00:08,459
You know what this is like?

1690
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:09,525
It's really just
like high school,

1691
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:12,527
but instead of french
homework, it's my dick.

1692
01:00:12,528 --> 01:00:15,262
Well that's not true because
French was actually hard.

1693
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,226
Hey, you've reached Gena.

1694
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:26,325
Oh my God, Gena.

1695
01:00:26,326 --> 01:00:27,292
I'm freaking out.

1696
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:28,226
I'm with Becky right now.

1697
01:00:28,227 --> 01:00:29,495
I don't know what to do!

1698
01:00:29,496 --> 01:00:32,259
I-I-I can't do this anymore.

1699
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,259
Call me back.

1700
01:00:42,426 --> 01:00:43,626
What are you doing?

1701
01:00:43,627 --> 01:00:45,658
Nothing.

1702
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:47,426
I thought you'd stopped.

1703
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:49,525
I haven't done
this in years, okay?

1704
01:00:49,526 --> 01:00:52,493
I'm just stressed
out and I needed,

1705
01:00:52,494 --> 01:00:54,091
I needed something for myself.

1706
01:00:54,092 --> 01:00:56,231
And I needed to
feel better, okay?

1707
01:01:00,227 --> 01:01:03,026
Remember when we'd
skip AP English class

1708
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:04,526
and hang out in the bathroom?

1709
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:08,291
We'd like bitch
out those smokers

1710
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:10,157
so that we could have
the really cool stall

1711
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:10,794
at the end.

1712
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:14,594
The disabled toilet.

1713
01:01:15,593 --> 01:01:18,192
Then we'd just
like talk and talk

1714
01:01:18,193 --> 01:01:21,558
for like 90 minutes
the entire period.

1715
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:23,492
I really miss that.

1716
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:24,524
Just that.

1717
01:01:24,525 --> 01:01:27,124
Like all day, I'd seriously
look forward to it.

1718
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:32,791
Then the vice principal found us.

1719
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:34,512
And she said she was
gonna tell your parents

1720
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:39,592
that you were
throwing up on purpose.

1721
01:01:39,593 --> 01:01:43,657
And I said, "No, it was me.
I was, like, doing it.

1722
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,324
I, it was totally my problem.

1723
01:01:46,325 --> 01:01:49,758
And then everyone found out

1724
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:51,692
and they were like "Eh, Becky.

1725
01:01:51,693 --> 01:01:53,524
She can't even
throw up properly.

1726
01:01:53,525 --> 01:01:54,525
She's so fat.

1727
01:01:54,526 --> 01:01:55,559
Take a laxative!"

1728
01:01:57,191 --> 01:01:59,058
And then I was crying.

1729
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:00,591
And what did you say?

1730
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:04,193
I said, "Fuck everyone."

1731
01:02:05,192 --> 01:02:06,591
Yeah.

1732
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:08,190
You don't know how many times

1733
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:12,025
I've said that to myself..
And

1734
01:02:12,026 --> 01:02:13,591
that makes me feel
a whole lot better.

1735
01:02:13,592 --> 01:02:15,490
Becks?

1736
01:02:15,491 --> 01:02:18,356
I need to tell you something.

1737
01:02:18,357 --> 01:02:20,691
What?

1738
01:02:20,692 --> 01:02:22,758
I did something terrible.

1739
01:02:22,759 --> 01:02:24,460
Oh, what is it?

1740
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,090
What's going on?

1741
01:02:29,091 --> 01:02:31,023
Is everything all right?

1742
01:02:31,024 --> 01:02:32,156
Yeah.

1743
01:02:32,157 --> 01:02:33,257
Well, hair and makeup is

1744
01:02:33,258 --> 01:02:34,790
gonna be in your
room in an hour.

1745
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:38,324
So we need to get going, okay?

1746
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:40,324
Holy shit.

1747
01:02:40,325 --> 01:02:41,258
It's time.

1748
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:44,423
It's time.

1749
01:02:44,424 --> 01:02:48,123
Oh, it's time... It's time.

1750
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:49,766
Fuck my life.

1751
01:02:57,758 --> 01:02:58,690
Oh.

1752
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,162
You still do that.

1753
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:06,654
Fuck!

1754
01:03:06,655 --> 01:03:07,523
Wedding!

1755
01:03:07,524 --> 01:03:08,527
Shit!

1756
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:13,568
Oh, dress!

1757
01:03:25,556 --> 01:03:26,457
She's coming!

1758
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:28,055
Look alive, people.

1759
01:03:28,056 --> 01:03:29,622
Oh, do you have a second?

1760
01:03:29,623 --> 01:03:30,454
I'm on the phone.

1761
01:03:30,455 --> 01:03:31,695
Okay, but... the wedding dress?

1762
01:03:32,123 --> 01:03:34,498
We can't find... Assholes.

1763
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:43,291
Okay.

1764
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,355
Jesus Christ, perv!

1765
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:47,487
What are you doing in here?

1766
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:48,655
I was j-it's Katie.

1767
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:50,454
Oh, what now?

1768
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:51,554
Sh-I'm a little worried.

1769
01:03:51,555 --> 01:03:52,721
I came back here to...

1770
01:03:52,722 --> 01:03:54,054
she's locked herself
in the bathroom.

1771
01:03:54,055 --> 01:03:55,024
I don't know what to do.

1772
01:03:55,025 --> 01:03:56,089
Oh, great!

1773
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,022
And I wasn't spying on you.

1774
01:03:57,023 --> 01:03:59,255
They let me in 'cause I
was looking for Katie.

1775
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:00,523
Can someone get a mimosa
ready for the bride?

1776
01:04:00,524 --> 01:04:01,389
Sure.

1777
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:02,255
Time check?
7.10.

1778
01:04:03,022 --> 01:04:04,021
Good, great.

1779
01:04:05,123 --> 01:04:05,123
It's probably fine,

1780
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,726
but it is just... she hasn't
been responding, and...

1781
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,588
Katie!

1782
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:16,420
You can't lock yourself
in the bathroom

1783
01:04:16,421 --> 01:04:17,656
when it isn't your wedding.

1784
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,688
Open this door.

1785
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,188
What do you think... how?

1786
01:04:21,189 --> 01:04:22,186
You're a genius.

1787
01:04:22,187 --> 01:04:24,388
Didn't you invent
iPads or something?

1788
01:04:24,389 --> 01:04:26,460
Why does everyone
think I invented the iPad?

1789
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:36,123
Keep trying this number

1790
01:04:37,023 --> 01:04:37,783
until you get Gena.

1791
01:04:40,721 --> 01:04:41,802
Why is your face like that?

1792
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:48,220
Here she is! Yay!

1793
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,788
I'm so excited, I
could kill myself.

1794
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,591
Oh, don't make any promises.

1795
01:04:57,589 --> 01:05:01,388
You said that you would
clean it if I fixed it.

1796
01:05:01,389 --> 01:05:02,791
I fixed it!

1797
01:05:05,788 --> 01:05:07,287
She's still not answering?

1798
01:05:10,721 --> 01:05:11,586
What is that?

1799
01:05:12,288 --> 01:05:13,786
Ow!

1800
01:05:13,787 --> 01:05:15,686
I was just about to go check.

1801
01:05:15,687 --> 01:05:17,120
How 'bout some music?

1802
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,055
Yeah.

1803
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:21,420
Thanks,

1804
01:05:22,054 --> 01:05:23,420
Well, what's going on in there?

1805
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:25,653
Maybe I should
call the front desk.

1806
01:05:25,654 --> 01:05:26,720
Should I go in, do you think?

1807
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:29,022
No, she's got it under control.

1808
01:05:30,021 --> 01:05:31,252
Knock it off!

1809
01:05:31,253 --> 01:05:32,386
We need to call a locksmith.

1810
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,752
No, she's being a fucking baby.

1811
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:34,753
I'm not gonna draw any
more attention to her.

1812
01:05:34,754 --> 01:05:35,835
But knocking down the door?

1813
01:05:36,021 --> 01:05:37,185
That's real fucking discreet.

1814
01:05:37,186 --> 01:05:38,121
Regan?

1815
01:05:38,122 --> 01:05:39,653
Oh, fuck me.

1816
01:05:39,654 --> 01:05:41,120
One second, Becks.

1817
01:05:41,121 --> 01:05:42,488
If that bitch finds
out that that bitch

1818
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:45,120
is pulling some seventh
grade tantrum bullshit,

1819
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:46,120
we're dead.

1820
01:05:47,121 --> 01:05:49,753
And I've lost the wedding dress.

1821
01:05:49,754 --> 01:05:50,553
Regan?

1822
01:05:50,554 --> 01:05:51,753
No, I didn't.

1823
01:05:51,754 --> 01:05:53,651
What is it?

1824
01:05:53,652 --> 01:05:54,518
It's for you.

1825
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:55,218
I don't want any.

1826
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:56,154
It's Gena.

1827
01:05:56,155 --> 01:05:57,618
Move, move, move, move!

1828
01:05:57,619 --> 01:05:58,518
Where the fuck are you?

1829
01:05:58,519 --> 01:05:59,751
Where the hell is it?

1830
01:05:59,752 --> 01:06:00,717
Why aren't you
picking up your cell?

1831
01:06:00,718 --> 01:06:03,086
I'm downstairs, it's
being dry-cleaned,

1832
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:04,208
and I threw it out a window.

1833
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:06,386
Dry-cleaned? How long?

1834
01:06:06,387 --> 01:06:07,686
They said 40 minutes.

1835
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:09,318
Fine. Get a new phone.

1836
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:10,719
Okay. What? How?

1837
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,453
Regan?

1838
01:06:12,452 --> 01:06:13,590
Steal one.

1839
01:06:16,587 --> 01:06:17,618
Um, Regan.

1840
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:18,754
This isn't what I ordered.

1841
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:20,285
This isn't what she ordered!

1842
01:06:20,286 --> 01:06:21,450
I said peonies.

1843
01:06:21,451 --> 01:06:22,717
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1844
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,318
What is that?

1845
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:27,053
They're doing maintenance
in the bathroom.

1846
01:06:27,054 --> 01:06:28,350
This hotel's disgusting.

1847
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,053
Honey, I think those
roses are gorgeous.

1848
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:32,687
But it's just not... what
we planned, you know?

1849
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,219
Fuck this. You get peonies.

1850
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,351
Downstairs.

1851
01:06:36,352 --> 01:06:37,417
Centerpieces for the reception,

1852
01:06:37,418 --> 01:06:38,487
take some peonies from there,

1853
01:06:38,488 --> 01:06:40,687
new bouquet up here,
40 minutes.

1854
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:42,720
I love you.

1855
01:06:44,718 --> 01:06:46,517
Relax!

1856
01:06:46,518 --> 01:06:47,686
Are you excited?

1857
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:49,717
Oh my God, yes!

1858
01:06:50,786 --> 01:06:52,060
Ask them...

1859
01:06:59,053 --> 01:07:01,084
Go make yourself useful.

1860
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:02,591
Go pick some peonies!

1861
01:07:09,218 --> 01:07:10,688
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1862
01:07:13,685 --> 01:07:17,420
Oh my... oooh, shit!

1863
01:07:18,419 --> 01:07:20,550
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1864
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:24,117
Katie, you stupid
fucking idiot.

1865
01:07:27,218 --> 01:07:29,319
Come in, shut the fuck...
oh my God.

1866
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:31,384
Just fucking go!

1867
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:32,145
She's on the floor.

1868
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:36,051
Well, wrap her up!

1869
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,184
Come on!

1870
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:38,416
What did you do to her?

1871
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:39,184
Nothing!

1872
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:41,281
We, I mean, we were
i-in the pool area...

1873
01:07:41,282 --> 01:07:42,416
Wrap her up! Wrap her up!

1874
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:43,616
I'm gonna get some water,

1875
01:07:43,617 --> 01:07:44,483
we're gonna sing
her her favorite song!

1876
01:07:44,484 --> 01:07:46,584
Well, shouldn't we,
like, get an ambulance?

1877
01:07:46,585 --> 01:07:48,583
No. She does this
every weekend.

1878
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:50,349
Why is she in the bathtub?

1879
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:51,784
Well, isn't that what you do?

1880
01:07:51,785 --> 01:07:54,648
No. Just pour the water
on her and sing the song.

1881
01:07:54,649 --> 01:07:55,385
Like this.

1882
01:07:55,386 --> 01:07:56,450
What song?

1883
01:07:56,451 --> 01:08:01,433
These dreams are...
when I close my eyes.

1884
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:06,416
Every second of the night,
I live another life.

1885
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:08,348
Hurry the weddings in an hour.

1886
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:10,283
I, I really, I, I
need the dress.

1887
01:08:10,284 --> 01:08:11,183
Now!

1888
01:08:11,184 --> 01:08:12,217
They're working on it.

1889
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:13,548
I am going home.

1890
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:15,750
What's your name?

1891
01:08:15,751 --> 01:08:16,483
Theresa.

1892
01:08:16,484 --> 01:08:17,749
Theresa!

1893
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,282
I know that you hate
me from yesterday.

1894
01:08:19,283 --> 01:08:20,384
I hate fucking hate
me too from yesterday.

1895
01:08:20,385 --> 01:08:23,050
Can we start fresh today?

1896
01:08:23,051 --> 01:08:24,585
New leaf, please?

1897
01:08:25,584 --> 01:08:26,284
Yeah, all right.

1898
01:08:27,283 --> 01:08:28,282
Really?

1899
01:08:28,283 --> 01:08:29,715
You'll stay?

1900
01:08:29,716 --> 01:08:31,249
I really have strong
feelings for you right now.

1901
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:32,416
Take it easy.

1902
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:34,783
The further I'm away, further I'm away.

1903
01:08:34,784 --> 01:08:36,582
There's something out there...

1904
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,249
Why aren't you waking up?

1905
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,182
It is very
surprising at this point

1906
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:44,016
'cause your lips are
literally fucking blue, now.

1907
01:08:44,017 --> 01:08:45,417
Okay, now I'm getting
really scared.

1908
01:08:45,616 --> 01:08:46,581
Come on.

1909
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:47,481
Let's laugh about this.

1910
01:08:47,482 --> 01:08:48,317
When you passed out?
PLEASE WAKE UP!!!

1911
01:08:48,783 --> 01:08:49,782
Come on.

1912
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:54,915
Look!

1913
01:08:55,516 --> 01:08:57,016
It's not fucked up anymore!

1914
01:08:57,017 --> 01:08:58,315
It's a miracle!

1915
01:08:58,316 --> 01:08:59,450
Yay!

1916
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:02,248
It's finally happening.

1917
01:09:02,249 --> 01:09:02,249
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1918
01:09:02,783 --> 01:09:04,116
Don't cry.

1919
01:09:04,117 --> 01:09:05,381
we need the other bridesmaids.

1920
01:09:05,382 --> 01:09:06,615
Where are the other two girls?

1921
01:09:06,616 --> 01:09:09,015
Uh, Gena and Katie
are on their way.

1922
01:09:09,016 --> 01:09:10,214
Okay, and why don't we

1923
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:11,148
get the bride in her
dress so we can...

1924
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:13,383
Yeah, okay, yeah, that's
what I was gonna do.

1925
01:09:13,384 --> 01:09:14,382
Yeah.

1926
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,180
I need to get my dress on.

1927
01:09:16,181 --> 01:09:18,548
I need to get my dress on.

1928
01:09:18,549 --> 01:09:20,114
Yes, very-I don't know.

1929
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:21,047
She was definitely breathing.

1930
01:09:21,048 --> 01:09:22,213
Why aren't you singing?

1931
01:09:22,214 --> 01:09:23,148
I'm on the phone
with the paramedics.

1932
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:24,648
She's always like this.

1933
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:25,483
What is this?

1934
01:09:25,484 --> 01:09:27,014
It's xanax.

1935
01:09:27,015 --> 01:09:28,213
Trevor gave them to me.

1936
01:09:28,214 --> 01:09:29,483
They must have
fallen out of my pocket.

1937
01:09:29,484 --> 01:09:30,447
Trevor?

1938
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:31,713
Yes. Five-five minutes.

1939
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:32,681
They're gonna be
here in five minutes.

1940
01:09:32,682 --> 01:09:33,763
It's Manhattan on saturday.

1941
01:09:33,782 --> 01:09:33,782
Five minutes is like
30 minutes.

1942
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,748
Get her out of the tub.

1943
01:09:37,749 --> 01:09:40,015
Just a minute!

1944
01:09:40,781 --> 01:09:41,580
Yeah?

1945
01:09:41,714 --> 01:09:45,414
Um, we're just missing
Katie and Gena.

1946
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:46,381
I guess we found Katie.

1947
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:47,513
Why are you here?

1948
01:09:47,514 --> 01:09:48,747
Becky's asking for her dress.

1949
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:49,615
Do you, like, know where it is?

1950
01:09:49,616 --> 01:09:50,646
With Gena.

1951
01:09:50,647 --> 01:09:52,015
Both will be here momentarily

1952
01:09:52,782 --> 01:09:55,180
But the itinerary said that
we were supposed to...

1953
01:09:55,181 --> 01:09:56,246
Reviving a fucked-up bitch

1954
01:09:56,247 --> 01:09:58,449
wasn't on the itinerary either!
Cover for me.

1955
01:09:59,448 --> 01:10:00,583
Okay.

1956
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:03,582
Give her to me.

1957
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,313
Okay.

1958
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:06,081
All right, Katie.

1959
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:07,413
Come on.

1960
01:10:07,414 --> 01:10:09,112
What are you do...
you're hurting her!

1961
01:10:09,113 --> 01:10:10,148
I'm helping her.

1962
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:12,146
she can take it.

1963
01:10:13,082 --> 01:10:14,714
There it is. Good job!

1964
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:16,314
Get it all out.

1965
01:10:16,315 --> 01:10:20,146
Good job. Good job.

1966
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:23,046
Good job.

1967
01:10:23,047 --> 01:10:25,413
Why would you ever
do that to yourself?

1968
01:10:25,414 --> 01:10:26,784
I wanted to be beautiful.

1969
01:10:31,747 --> 01:10:33,012
Thank you! Thank you!

1970
01:10:33,013 --> 01:10:34,246
Where is Regan?

1971
01:10:34,247 --> 01:10:35,313
Let me fucking go.

1972
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:36,447
Oh, she's here.

1973
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:39,146
Regan, what's going on?

1974
01:10:39,147 --> 01:10:42,146
I just...
What is on your dress?

1975
01:10:42,147 --> 01:10:44,246
Oh, I... sorry.

1976
01:10:44,247 --> 01:10:46,147
Well, where is her dress?

1977
01:10:46,148 --> 01:10:48,446
Uh, it's being steamed.

1978
01:10:48,447 --> 01:10:51,145
I-I can't leave here
without my dress.

1979
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:52,146
I don't believe this!

1980
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:53,746
Let's just...

1981
01:10:53,747 --> 01:10:55,244
I don't know what's going on
with the steaming or whatever,

1982
01:10:55,245 --> 01:10:56,478
but I don't care.

1983
01:10:56,479 --> 01:10:57,747
I want the dress right here,
on my daughter immediately.

1984
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,146
She can't wear the dress
in the car, Victoria Silk?

1985
01:11:02,147 --> 01:11:03,779
Plus sitting in traffic?

1986
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,382
What does that equal?

1987
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:08,746
Sweat wrinkles. Exactly, thank you.
Oh my God.

1988
01:11:08,747 --> 01:11:10,345
You think of everything.

1989
01:11:10,346 --> 01:11:11,713
That's why she's maid of honor.

1990
01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:12,712
Let's go.

1991
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:17,459
Don't close your eyes.
Just talk to me now.

1992
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:18,544
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1993
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:19,611
What happened to her?

1994
01:11:19,612 --> 01:11:20,446
I'm taking her to the hospital.

1995
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:21,544
What?

1996
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:22,546
Somebody vomited
in the bathtub.

1997
01:11:22,547 --> 01:11:24,644
She kinda o'd'ed on xanaxes.

1998
01:11:24,645 --> 01:11:25,511
You fucking...!

1999
01:11:25,512 --> 01:11:26,278
They weren't mine!

2000
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:27,080
Whose? Whose?
Trevor!

2001
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,025
Trevor.

2002
01:11:41,012 --> 01:11:42,078
What do you want?

2003
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,011
Wait. You actually...

2004
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:46,178
Car five, are we ready? Good!

2005
01:11:46,179 --> 01:11:47,859
You can't just barge in here like that.
Oh.

2006
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,144
Hey.

2007
01:11:50,145 --> 01:11:51,778
Holy shit!

2008
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:52,900
What the fuck are you doing?

2009
01:11:53,646 --> 01:11:55,611
Why the fuck did you do that?

2010
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:58,545
Ah! Come here.

2011
01:12:02,413 --> 01:12:04,312
You motherfucker!

2012
01:12:04,313 --> 01:12:05,343
It's me! It's me, it's me.

2013
01:12:05,344 --> 01:12:06,377
Where are you?

2014
01:12:06,378 --> 01:12:07,442
We're getting into the car.

2015
01:12:07,443 --> 01:12:08,579
Okay, I'm on my way.

2016
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,078
All right. Meet me there, ese.

2017
01:12:11,645 --> 01:12:12,745
Oh, God.

2018
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:14,481
Okay, let's get to the wedding.

2019
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:18,386
Fuck!

2020
01:12:25,379 --> 01:12:26,276
Hey.

2021
01:12:26,277 --> 01:12:27,343
How is she?

2022
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:28,210
They're saying she's fine.

2023
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:29,244
You okay? You okay?

2024
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:31,577
Okay, I'll go, I'll go
with you to the hospital.

2025
01:12:31,578 --> 01:12:32,743
No, she wants us to
go to the wedding!

2026
01:12:32,744 --> 01:12:34,176
She keeps saying
go to the wedding.

2027
01:12:34,177 --> 01:12:35,510
They don't even have
to pump her stomach.

2028
01:12:35,511 --> 01:12:36,277
They're just checking
her as a precaution.

2029
01:12:36,278 --> 01:12:37,211
Really?

2030
01:12:37,212 --> 01:12:38,442
Regan saved her life.

2031
01:12:38,443 --> 01:12:39,708
That woman is fucked
in the head, but...

2032
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:41,030
She's a good friend.
Yeah, I know.

2033
01:12:41,544 --> 01:12:42,577
Okay.

2034
01:12:42,578 --> 01:12:43,245
I'll see you at the wedding!

2035
01:12:43,246 --> 01:12:44,178
Okay.

2036
01:12:48,578 --> 01:12:49,512
Taxi!

2037
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,244
Hey, Gena.

2038
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:54,311
I need to talk to you.

2039
01:12:54,312 --> 01:12:56,143
No. No. Clyde.

2040
01:12:56,144 --> 01:12:57,610
Get in the cab!

2041
01:12:57,611 --> 01:12:57,611
Isn't that dress supposed to
be on the bride right now?

2042
01:12:58,477 --> 01:13:00,446
Yes! Get in the car!

2043
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:05,242
Sir! S... I will suck your dick

2044
01:13:05,243 --> 01:13:06,378
if you get us
there in two minutes.

2045
01:13:06,379 --> 01:13:09,075
Look, I... I think we might
be meant for each other.

2046
01:13:09,076 --> 01:13:10,776
And I'm not kidding
Scratch that.

2047
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:10,777
This guy will suck your dick.

2048
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:14,309
Look, and it's not just
because we have like,

2049
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,177
the greatest sex I... whoa!

2050
01:13:16,178 --> 01:13:17,309
Whoa!

2051
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,590
See, I, your body
looks so great.

2052
01:13:19,577 --> 01:13:20,077
Shut up.

2053
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:22,076
I love your body so much.

2054
01:13:22,077 --> 01:13:24,141
Oh my God, you cannot
just fuck things

2055
01:13:24,142 --> 01:13:25,209
into being better.

2056
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,410
Then tell me what I should do.

2057
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,742
I'm getting married.

2058
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:31,411
I'm getting married
in my pajamas.

2059
01:13:31,412 --> 01:13:33,409
Honey, you've just
got to calm down.

2060
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,075
I don't think she's
got the dress.

2061
01:13:35,076 --> 01:13:37,010
Honey, just don't
pay any mind to it.

2062
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:38,675
It's all fucked up.

2063
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:40,643
I'm gonna walk in
wearing my pajamas

2064
01:13:40,644 --> 01:13:43,242
like I'm fucking
Michael Jackson.

2065
01:13:43,243 --> 01:13:45,508
It's like I've been
at a fucking concert

2066
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:46,407
for the past decade.

2067
01:13:46,408 --> 01:13:47,243
A concert?

2068
01:13:47,244 --> 01:13:49,507
Yeah, it's a, it's a metaphor.

2069
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:52,341
Okay? It's like I've been
at a concert... Okay.

2070
01:13:52,342 --> 01:13:53,440
And I'm swaying back and forth

2071
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:54,240
and somebody
passes me something,

2072
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:57,241
and I drink it or smoke it...
Smoke it?

2073
01:13:57,242 --> 01:13:58,803
you know, it doesn't matter!
Shut up!

2074
01:13:59,343 --> 01:14:00,310
I hate you!

2075
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:01,642
And I hate you!

2076
01:14:01,643 --> 01:14:03,409
I hope you fucking die!

2077
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:06,174
It's gonna be waiting
for us there, right?

2078
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,774
I'm right about that,
aren't I, Regan,

2079
01:14:07,775 --> 01:14:09,010
so quiet in the back.

2080
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,576
Come on, Gena, you can do this.

2081
01:14:10,577 --> 01:14:11,643
Take a left here.

2082
01:14:11,644 --> 01:14:13,274
In the past 24 hours,

2083
01:14:13,275 --> 01:14:15,240
I've realized that I don't
even like the concert.

2084
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:16,307
I don't like the music.

2085
01:14:16,308 --> 01:14:17,440
I don't like the band.

2086
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:18,275
None of it.

2087
01:14:18,276 --> 01:14:21,540
I-I... And like, maybe,
if I had just picked

2088
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:22,708
a different fucking band,

2089
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:26,242
maybe I woulda had a better
time at the concert.

2090
01:14:26,243 --> 01:14:28,010
I really think I'm
in love with you.

2091
01:14:28,011 --> 01:14:30,275
Oh my God, if you
take Park Avenue,

2092
01:14:30,276 --> 01:14:32,777
I will fucking end
you I will end you!

2093
01:14:33,776 --> 01:14:35,308
Of all the things you've done

2094
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:37,042
in the entire time
we've known each other,

2095
01:14:37,043 --> 01:14:38,507
this is the worst.

2096
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:41,041
You fucking blonde cunt!

2097
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:43,440
This is shit!

2098
01:14:43,441 --> 01:14:44,540
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

2099
01:14:44,541 --> 01:14:45,709
I saved the day!
I saved the day!

2100
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,641
Okay, okay.

2101
01:14:47,642 --> 01:14:48,675
Let's do this!

2102
01:14:48,676 --> 01:14:50,009
Okay. Okay.

2103
01:14:51,008 --> 01:14:52,329
All right,
let's get this shit on.

2104
01:14:53,008 --> 01:14:54,075
Now, put your arms up!

2105
01:14:54,076 --> 01:14:55,410
Got it?

2106
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,144
let me get the veil,
so it doesn't...

2107
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:01,042
We got the dress!

2108
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:07,174
Yeah! Yeah! Heck yeah!

2109
01:15:07,175 --> 01:15:08,774
Wa-wa-wa-wait-wait.

2110
01:15:08,775 --> 01:15:11,375
What happened to it?

2111
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:12,442
What happened there?

2112
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:15,339
Tell me. Tell me!

2113
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,406
It's just,
there's a little rip.

2114
01:15:17,407 --> 01:15:18,474
The stitching.

2115
01:15:18,475 --> 01:15:19,507
'Cause it ripped a little bit.
And that's just like a tin...

2116
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:24,240
like a little blood
and, and semen.

2117
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:25,639
What?

2118
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,508
I don't know if it's semen.
It might be semen.

2119
01:15:26,509 --> 01:15:27,707
you ruined it!

2120
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:28,772
Shh. It's okay.

2121
01:15:28,773 --> 01:15:30,141
No, you don't see it. I swear.

2122
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:40,106
Oh fuck.

2123
01:15:40,107 --> 01:15:41,674
I can't do this.

2124
01:15:41,675 --> 01:15:42,739
Rebecca Archer!

2125
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,006
You're going to walk down that

2126
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:46,143
aisle and you are going to
marry the man down there.

2127
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:51,173
Everyone thinks I'm
too fat for him.

2128
01:15:51,174 --> 01:15:52,211
Fuck everyone!

2129
01:15:56,207 --> 01:15:58,172
Right!

2130
01:15:58,173 --> 01:16:00,040
Fuck everyone!

2131
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:01,206
Yeah! Fuck everyone!

2132
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:01,888
I like ice cream!

2133
01:16:02,407 --> 01:16:05,139
Fuck everyone!

2134
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:05,673
Yes!

2135
01:16:05,674 --> 01:16:06,711
Okay. Flowers.

2136
01:16:10,707 --> 01:16:13,071
You're beautiful.

2137
01:16:13,072 --> 01:16:15,044
Give me a hug.

2138
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:22,306
Wait, uh, you go-going?

2139
01:16:22,307 --> 01:16:23,705
No. I have vomit on me.

2140
01:16:23,706 --> 01:16:25,751
Okay. Right. Okay.

2141
01:17:11,405 --> 01:17:13,006
I would like to close this
ceremony with a blessing.

2142
01:17:13,007 --> 01:17:16,538
But it is as timeless and
enduring as love itself.

2143
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:18,637
Now you will feel no cold,

2144
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:21,603
for each of you will
be warm to the other.

2145
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:24,271
Now you will feel no loneliness,

2146
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:27,504
for each of you will be
a companion... Wait.

2147
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:29,503
Are you crying?

2148
01:17:29,504 --> 01:17:31,536
Come on.

2149
01:17:31,537 --> 01:17:34,141
You haven't cried since Thomas J.
died in 'My Girl'.

2150
01:17:36,139 --> 01:17:37,437
It's a perfect wedding.

2151
01:17:44,738 --> 01:17:46,047
Are we gonna be okay, you guys?

2152
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:58,036
Let's toast to something, okay?

2153
01:17:58,037 --> 01:17:58,771
All right.

2154
01:17:58,772 --> 01:18:00,136
What should we drink to?

2155
01:18:00,137 --> 01:18:01,537
To the EMT crew.

2156
01:18:01,538 --> 01:18:02,505
Sure.

2157
01:18:03,504 --> 01:18:06,669
To never doing any
of that ever again.

2158
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:08,074
Cheers.

2159
01:18:11,071 --> 01:18:13,304
Oh, fuck it, let's
just get a drink.

2160
01:18:13,305 --> 01:18:14,103
Yes!

2161
01:18:19,371 --> 01:18:20,603
How, how are you
feeling... I mean,

2162
01:18:20,604 --> 01:18:22,635
you drank quite a bit.

2163
01:18:22,636 --> 01:18:24,503
I really like you a lot.

2164
01:18:24,504 --> 01:18:27,037
Well, I like you too.

2165
01:18:27,038 --> 01:18:28,403
But I don't know what to do

2166
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:30,103
when I'm around
somebody I like,

2167
01:18:30,104 --> 01:18:34,569
except for sleep with
them or get really drunk.

2168
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:37,135
I-I mean, you can
just be nice to them.

2169
01:18:37,136 --> 01:18:38,771
I'll be nice to you,
you be nice to me.

2170
01:18:38,772 --> 01:18:39,770
Really?

2171
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:41,335
that's what people do, yeah.

2172
01:18:41,336 --> 01:18:43,101
Thank you for letting
me copy your homework.

2173
01:18:43,102 --> 01:18:43,702
You're welcome.

2174
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:46,203
Thank you for,
for not dying today.

2175
01:18:46,204 --> 01:18:47,403
Mm.

2176
01:18:47,404 --> 01:18:48,337
It's kinda blowing my mind.

2177
01:18:48,338 --> 01:18:51,735
I feel like, like for
the last decade,

2178
01:18:51,736 --> 01:18:54,735
I've been at like, at a concert.
Right? Just kinda...

2179
01:18:54,736 --> 01:18:56,669
Oh please take your
self-actualization

2180
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:58,135
somewhere else.

2181
01:18:58,136 --> 01:18:59,434
I'm trying to sleep.

2182
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:02,077
Oh, hey, you guys.

2183
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:09,667
Hello.

2184
01:19:09,668 --> 01:19:10,736
Is this working?

2185
01:19:10,737 --> 01:19:13,035
Uh, testing, testing, testing.

2186
01:19:13,036 --> 01:19:15,469
Sibilance, sibilance.

2187
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:17,369
Tom Hanks, SNL.

2188
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:20,535
Um, uh, Becky and Dale.

2189
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:23,668
Such a beautiful wedding.

2190
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:29,067
Yeah. A gorgeous wedding.

2191
01:19:29,068 --> 01:19:30,503
I think we all felt
like stars tonight

2192
01:19:30,504 --> 01:19:34,767
in the sky of your love!
Yeah!

2193
01:19:34,768 --> 01:19:37,667
So, Dale, you said something
to me last night.

2194
01:19:37,668 --> 01:19:39,600
You said that when you
find the right girl...

2195
01:19:39,601 --> 01:19:41,035
Did you go out last night?

2196
01:19:41,036 --> 01:19:44,667
When you, when
you got it uh, good,

2197
01:19:44,668 --> 01:19:48,368
you don't do anything
to screw it up.

2198
01:19:48,369 --> 01:19:53,700
But for some people, um,
and I'm one of them,

2199
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:55,534
I think you have to screw it up

2200
01:19:55,535 --> 01:19:59,233
uh, before you realize
that you've got it good.

2201
01:19:59,234 --> 01:20:02,034
I-I I'm just excited
because Gena and I,

2202
01:20:02,035 --> 01:20:03,468
we had sex last night.

2203
01:20:03,469 --> 01:20:04,601
What the fuck?

2204
01:20:04,602 --> 01:20:06,099
We did, but like
who cares, right?

2205
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:06,735
I-I can say that.

2206
01:20:06,736 --> 01:20:08,334
Can I say that?

2207
01:20:08,335 --> 01:20:13,067
But the thing is, is when
we're having sex, it's fine,

2208
01:20:13,068 --> 01:20:19,534
I put my penis uh, into um,
Gena's vagina... Please.

2209
01:20:19,535 --> 01:20:21,501
And then I took it out.

2210
01:20:21,502 --> 01:20:24,599
And then I, I put it in again.

2211
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,899
And then I took it out.

2212
01:20:26,135 --> 01:20:29,466
And then it just kinda went
on like that for a while.

2213
01:20:29,467 --> 01:20:30,701
And I, what I realized

2214
01:20:30,702 --> 01:20:33,301
was I wanted to
just keep doing that

2215
01:20:33,302 --> 01:20:36,333
for the rest of my life.

2216
01:20:36,334 --> 01:20:40,533
That's kinda where
I am at right now.

2217
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:42,002
Uh, but that's not the only
reason I'm up here.

2218
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:48,266
I'm also um, here to,

2219
01:20:48,267 --> 01:20:51,600
When I wake up,
well you know I'm gonna be,

2220
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:55,332
I'm gonna be the man who
wakes up next to you.

2221
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,666
Stop it! Stop it!

2222
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:59,632
When I get out, well
you know I'm gonna be,

2223
01:20:59,633 --> 01:21:03,234
I'm gonna be the man who...
yeah, really? Okay.

2224
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:05,466
No, I can't sing.

2225
01:21:05,467 --> 01:21:07,533
But you understand what
I was trying to do?

2226
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:09,133
Yeah.

2227
01:21:09,134 --> 01:21:10,365
Yeah? All right.

2228
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,967
Well, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna pass it off...

2229
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:21,033
When I wake up, well
I know I'm gonna be...

2230
01:21:21,034 --> 01:21:22,499
What?

2231
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,199
I'm gonna be the man
who wakes up next to you.

2232
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,499
When I go out, well,
I know I'm gonna be,

2233
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,365
I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you.

2234
01:21:32,366 --> 01:21:35,698
If I get drunk, well,
I know I'm gonna be,

2235
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:39,565
I'm gonna be the man who
gets drunk next to you.

2236
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:43,064
And if I haver, yeah,
I know I'm gonna be,

2237
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,398
I'm gonna be the man
who's havering to you.

2238
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:46,364
Call me.

2239
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:47,163
Come to the bathroom.

2240
01:21:47,164 --> 01:21:48,132
Oh, fuck off!

2241
01:21:48,133 --> 01:21:50,598
I would walk 500 miles

2242
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:54,566
and I would walk 500 more

2243
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:58,999
just to be the man who
walked a 1000 miles

2244
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,531
to fall down at your door
