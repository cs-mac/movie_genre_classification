1
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,940
What's your wish?

2
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,770
My wish is...

3
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,240
I want to take back...

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,710
what I said last night.

5
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,670
I don't want to be awkward with you.

6
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,140
Just forget about everything.

7
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,610
That's my wish.

8
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,270
You confessed last night and now you want me to forget it?

9
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,840
Why is she confusing me like this?

10
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,670
Okay?

11
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,740
It's my wish so you have to grant it.

12
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,570
I can stay with you longer...

13
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,240
only if you grant my wish.

14
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,440
Bong Pal.

15
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,710
Hyun Ji.

16
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,910
It feels so weird.

17
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Hyun Ji.

18
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,840
Bong Pal.

19
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,810
Hyun Ji.

20
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,740
Hyun Ji!

21
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,170
Hyun Ji.

22
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,310
Where did she go?

23
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,870
Hyun Ji!

24
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,640
Hyun Ji.

25
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,310
Bong Pal.

26
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,510
Don't disappear...

27
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,570
ever again.

28
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,470
(Bring it on, Ghost)

29
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,580
(Episode 9)

30
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,080
Goodnight.

31
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
You too.

32
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,710
Hyun Ji.

33
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,110
Yes?

34
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,080
It's hot these days.

35
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,080
You should sleep in my room from now on.

36
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,410
- Me?
-  Yes.

37
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,310
I can't stand the heat.

38
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,640
Goodnight.

39
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,170
Okay.

40
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,810
Don't disappear...

41
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,970
ever again.

42
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,110
His father passed away in an accident when he was young.

43
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,270
After that, he lived with his mother.

44
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,910
When he went to middle school, he lived in a dormitory.

45
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,110
Since then he lived alone.

46
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,440
I think he keeps in contact with his mother but he doesn't visit her.

47
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,940
- Is this it?
-  Yes.

48
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,890
There's nothing much to investigate about him.

49
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,210
He never received a bill in his life.

50
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,050
He pays his taxes well.

51
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,710
All there are his medical records.

52
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,440
- What is it?
-  It's not much.

53
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,010
He was very ill when little.

54
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,040
He has many medical records.

55
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,440
- What do the people say about him?
-  They all praise him.

56
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,190
"He's kind. He's trustworthy."

57
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,970
That's understandable. He volunteers at five different places.

58
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,610
He provides medical help to abandoned dogs without charge.

59
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,240
Nobody ever saw him lose his temper before.

60
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,450
My goodness.

61
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,230
Brains, looks and personality. He has it all.

62
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,670
You're right. He's perfect.

63
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,070
He's too perfect for a human.

64
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,940
Too perfect.

65
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,670
Shouldn't we change the direction of the investigation?

66
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,170
Have you found Noh Hyun Joo's cellphone?

67
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,420
No. I contacted the mobile carrier.

68
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,710
They told me that her phone was turned off in front of her house.

69
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,240
Check her cellphone call log and see...

70
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,990
- if you missed out anyone.
-  Okay.

71
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,740
Track the location of Mr Ju's cellphone from 1st to 2nd.

72
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,140
See his vehicle records and compare it with where the body was found.

73
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,440
All right.

74
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,870
(Ju Hye Sung)

75
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,210
Did you hear how Hyun Joo died?

76
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,200
Her neck was broken.

77
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,240
- Really?
-  Yes.

78
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,910
- My goodness.
-  Have they found the culprit?

79
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
Not yet.

80
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
Min Soo's here.

81
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,010
Who is he?

82
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,210
He asked Hyun Joo out last semester.

83
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,940
Professor. Hello.

84
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,950
You must have come to offer your condolences.

85
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,010
Yes.

86
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,970
- Professor.
-  Then see to your business.

87
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,210
- Are you up?
-  Yes.

88
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,610
You must be hungry. Wait a moment.

89
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,740
- Are you not eating?
-  What?

90
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,170
I will.

91
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,940
Why? Is it bad?

92
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,610
No, it's good.

93
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,670
Why are you picking at the food?

94
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,670
I'm not. This is how I eat.

95
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,030
The green light is on. Let's run.

96
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,040
What?

97
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,170
What is the title of the book?

98
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,110
It's "Principles of Economics".

99
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,840
"Principles of Economics"?

100
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,310
It must be around here.

101
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I found it.

102
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,910
Excuse me.

103
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,030
I just remembered I forgot something.

104
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,040
See you later.

105
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Hey, where are you...

106
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,400
Enjoy.

107
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,440
Thank you. Please take care.

108
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,340
In Rang, let's eat.

109
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,990
- Okay.
-  Let's eat.

110
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,450
Let me see.

111
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,570
One.

112
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,510
Two.

113
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Three...

114
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,260
Why do we have so many?

115
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,830
I ordered one for Bong Pal as well.

116
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,640
We're including Bong Pal, but we have four.

117
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Hey!

118
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,270
You...

119
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,140
You've changed.

120
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,340
Did making money change you?

121
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,380
Then...

122
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,410
All right.

123
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,980
This one.

124
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
This galbi lunch box.

125
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,520
It's my favourite.

126
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,340
I'll try it.

127
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,170
- It's for Hyun Ji.
-  What?

128
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,340
- It's for Hyun Ji.
-  Hyun...

129
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Hold on.

130
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,840
- You mean the angel?
-  Yes, the angel.

131
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,880
You lost your head over her. You're desperate to win her heart.

132
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,220
Giving shoes to her and all that.

133
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,100
Love makes you do crazy stuff.

134
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,490
Yes, you are crazy. You crazy fool.

135
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,370
Why don't you ask her out?

136
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,540
I'm too shy. Don't say that.

137
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,670
Gosh.

138
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,040
You've totally lost your mind.

139
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,030
You... You...

140
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,970
You're a human, and she's a ghost. You know what it is.

141
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,210
That means she's dead.

142
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,780
Look at him.

143
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,240
Why don't you marry her and have a child?

144
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,650
Gosh, you look so happy.

145
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,770
Ghosts and humans can never live together.

146
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,910
Can't you see that?

147
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,140
But it's too early to talk about marrying her.

148
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,400
You know where you should go?

149
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,010
Samil Mental Hospital. You need to be admitted.

150
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,140
Don't start eating first.

151
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,140
We'll eat together when Hyun Ji and Bong Pal come.

152
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,510
You're so rude. How can you dare to eat first...

153
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,940
when the angel hasn't gotten here yet?

154
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,570
Wait!

155
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,810
Stay still.

156
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,040
My heart almost burst.

157
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,940
I wish Kyung Ja were here to talk about Bong Pal.

158
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,810
Where is she, anyway?

159
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,840
She hasn't been around for a while.

160
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,910
She's not here either.

161
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,440
Did she go home?

162
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,790
Hello, Bong Pal.

163
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,020
Hello.

164
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,070
Hi, Hyun Ji.

165
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,010
Well, Hyun Ji isn't here.

166
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,270
Really? Where is she?

167
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,270
I think she went home.

168
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,210
Bong Pal, come take a seat.

169
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,740
You seem like you have a lot on your mind.

170
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,540
- It's about a girl...
-  A girl?

171
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,510
I want to do something for a girl,

172
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,540
and I have no idea what I should do.

173
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,140
- It's not about me.
-  Of course, it's not.

174
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,860
It's your friend's worry, right?

175
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,020
Yes, that's right.

176
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,680
Girls... Women...

177
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,710
Women, female, girls.

178
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,740
Should I give you a special lesson?

179
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,940
It's hard to grasp what women want and need.

180
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,410
You're talking nonsense.

181
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,940
Do you even know what love is?

182
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,070
Little brats like you know nothing about love. Shut it.

183
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,710
Before finding out what she wants,

184
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,340
you must know what kind of guys she finds attractive first, okay?

185
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,610
Assistant Kim. Look at him.

186
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,650
It's okay to be ugly.

187
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,240
Ghost Net.

188
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,720
Put your hand under your face and move your fingers.

189
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,070
It's okay to look foolish.

190
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,970
What women find attractive...

191
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,200
isn't something trivial like that.

192
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Then, what kind of charms would women find fascinating?

193
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,070
Being "charming" in English.

194
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,880
In another word, a... at...

195
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,380
Let's say it's appealing points. Let's begin, then.

196
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,610
Step one!

197
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,100
Profile.

198
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,200
You must show her your masculine Adam's apple...

199
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,160
and your sharp nose that makes you look intellectual.

200
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,040
When women see such profile, they'll lose their heads...

201
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,770
They'll lose their heads over you.

202
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,310
Step two!

203
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,070
Eyes.

204
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,690
It's the eyes.

205
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,040
You need...

206
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,160
a wild look in your eyes that overwhelms women,

207
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,130
and a gentle gaze that's as deep as the sea.

208
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,210
If you look at women in such way,

209
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,990
their hearts will melt away,

210
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,770
just like glaciers melting under the hot sun.

211
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
Step three!

212
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,140
I'm fine. All right.

213
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,410
Don't cry, you fool

214
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,130
You must be able to make women laugh...

215
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,470
when they are depressed.

216
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,340
What kind of apple isn't an apple?

217
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,140
A pineapple.

218
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,440
Sense of humour.

219
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,330
I believe that sense of humour is one of the factors...

220
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,720
that make men attractive.

221
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,740
How is it?

222
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,880
Do you find it helpful?

223
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,650
It's all right.

224
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,140
There are still 8 more steps to go. There are 11 steps.

225
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,170
Step four!

226
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,380
That's more than enough. Thank you.

227
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,340
Hyun Ji.

228
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,910
Hyun Ji?

229
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,880
(Bong Pal and Hyun Ji)

230
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,140
Hyun Ji.

231
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,380
Yes, Bong Pal?

232
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,380
Where have you been?

233
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,040
I told you not to disappear. I looked for you everywhere.

234
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,240
I'm sorry.

235
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,940
- What were you doing here?
-  Nothing much.

236
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,710
Being "charming".

237
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,860
What makes men attractive?

238
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,110
Step one!

239
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,040
- Hyun Ji.
-  Yes?

240
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,810
- Bong Pal.
-  Yes?

241
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,110
- Bong Pal?
-  Why?

242
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,070
What's the matter? Are you hurt?

243
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,740
It's nothing. My neck is a bit sniff.

244
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
It's not working.

245
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,570
Step two. Eyes.

246
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,880
My eyes? Okay.

247
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,670
- Hyun Ji.
-  Why?

248
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,110
What? Is this a staring contest?

249
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,910
No, my eyes are dry.

250
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,880
It's not working either.

251
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,970
Step three.

252
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,240
I believe that sense of humour is one of the factors...

253
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,910
that make men attractive.

254
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,180
Shall I tell you something funny?

255
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,880
- What is it?
-  How does a monkey ring a doorbell?

256
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,900
King Kong!

257
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,710
What do you call a belt made out of watches?

258
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,540
- I have no idea.
-  A waist of time.

259
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,470
How about this? What kind of apple isn't an apple?

260
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,640
A pineapple.

261
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,410
A pineapple. Pine...

262
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,970
What's wrong with you today?

263
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,440
- Are you okay?
-  I am.

264
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,110
- None of these work.
-  What do you mean?

265
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,270
No, it's nothing.

266
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,070
Let's eat.

267
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,540
Meat. Meat. I love meat.

268
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,710
It's all cooked now. Can I eat?

269
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,810
Sure. Here.

270
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,370
Which would taste better?

271
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,510
Meat works every time.

272
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,910
That star is the brightest.

273
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,770
Do you mean that star? It's called Altair.

274
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,810
Do you mean Altair and Vega?

275
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,420
Yes.

276
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,710
Can you see that star over there?

277
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,740
It's Vega.

278
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,010
Can you see the Milky Way across the sky?

279
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,870
I see. I didn't know that.

280
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,110
They are really far apart.

281
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,770
They must be so sad.

282
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,810
They can only meet once a year.

283
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,240
Wouldn't they be grateful for being able to meet?

284
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,710
Even if it's only one day.

285
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,710
You know a lot about constellations.

286
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,240
My father taught me when I was young.

287
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,770
- Do you want to hear more?
-  Yes.

288
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,270
Can you see those stars over there? They are the Eagle.

289
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,410
It's also called Aquila.

290
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,140
Bong Pal. Are you asleep?

291
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,290
Go to bed.

292
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,410
We'll go out tomorrow.

293
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,410
Really? Are we going out for a date?

294
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:28,100
Well, you can put it that way.

295
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,340
Okay. I'll get up early.

296
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,670
See you in my dreams.

297
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,570
What do you want to do today?

298
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,690
How about an ordinary date?

299
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,070
Eat food, drink tea, watch a movie, walk.

300
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,330
Okay. Let's do what others do.

301
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,410
Okay.

302
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,470
Hey.

303
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,170
No. Don't.

304
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,270
Hey.

305
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,370
I'm sorry.

306
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,970
- I'm so sorry.
-  No, don't.

307
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,870
Stop it.

308
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,670
Excuse me.

309
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,840
What's taking her so long?

310
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,210
What should I wear for our first date?

311
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,870
Bong Pal.

312
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,610
Why did you want me out?

313
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
Just.

314
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,370
Let's go.

315
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,840
They are so pretty.

316
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,170
This doesn't look good.

317
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,370
It's similar to the dress you're wearing right now.

318
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,270
It's not bad, but..

319
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,870
Knock, knock.

320
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,870
What's on the menu?

321
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,140
We have makgeolli.

322
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,210
Really? Can I have a shot?

323
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,740
You shouldn't drink.

324
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,170
How do you like these?

325
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,970
You're so pretty.

326
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,410
This is nice, no?

327
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,540
Two seats for the 10 o'clock movie, please.

328
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,810
Would you like the couples seat?

329
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,210
The couples seat, please.

330
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,040
One moment.

331
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,640
Bong Pal. Can I have some?

332
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,810
Are you sure you can have it all?

333
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,670
Of course.

334
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,340
It feels like we're a real couple now.

335
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,340
Yes.

336
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Here.

337
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,910
What would you like to eat?

338
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,310
What you want to eat.

339
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,970
Excuse me.

00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,240
May I take your order?

I'll take Set Two.

I'm afraid that's for two people.

343
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,870
It's okay. I'll take it.

344

Also,

345
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,910
can you fill that glass?

346
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,770
Sure.

Didn't you spend too much today?

348
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,570
We went to a movie and had a course meal.

349
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,070
It's no big deal.

350
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,510
Still...

351
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,910
Fine. I'll work hard and earn you a lot of money.

Thank you.

00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,570
It's security camera footage from tollgates.

Wait.

371
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,810
You should see this.

372
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,710
It's his plate number, right?

373
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,310
Yes, it's Ju Hye Sung's plate number.

I gave it to the professor.

I've always wanted to ask you something.

What is it?

392
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,610
When did you start seeing ghosts?

393
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,770
Was I five years old?

394
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,940
I think it started then.

395
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,910
Were you that little?

396
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,570
How did it start?

397
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,070
Well...

398
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,510
Monk Myung Cheol says it's because I have evil spirits remaining in me.

399
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,470
Evil spirits?

400
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,610
What are they?

401
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,070
I don't know exactly.

402
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,410
I don't remember what happened...

403

before then.

404
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,570
You must have been scared.

405
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,940
Back then, yes.

406
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,870
Not any longer.

407
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,540
Thanks, Bong Pal.

When I woke up as a ghost with no memories left,

412
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,710
I was so scared and lonely.

413
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,870
But not any longer.

414
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,640

I'm so happy...

you can see me.

418
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,040
I'm happy...

419

I see.

429
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:17,140
You passed the tollgate at 11:28pm on the 1st.

430
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,970
You entered Inseong District at 1:38am on the 2nd.

431
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,210
You drove along Local Road 34...

432
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,370
to the entrance of Mount Woojeong.

433
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,010
You came back to Seoul that morning.

434
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Do you remember that?

435
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,110
- Yes.
-  As you might or might not know,

was found near that mountain.

00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,340
She was killed on the night of the first.

439
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,470
Presumably, she was buried on the morning of the second.

440
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,910
You apparently happened to be there at that time.

441
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
Is that a coincidence?

442
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,910
Why did you go to a mountain in the middle of the night?

443
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Well...

444
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,540
It seems like I'm a suspect now.

445
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,640

- Your mother?
-  You can check it if you want.

What do you mean by that?

455
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,640
One of the testifiers in the Noh Hyun Joo case has died.

456
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,670
Which one?

457
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,240
It's Lee Min Soo. He goes to Myongsong University.

458
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,440
He talked to the victim on the phone for one minute,

459
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,610
so I put him on the testifers list.

460
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,270
He committed suicide by jumping off the building he lived in.

461
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,470
- He committed suicide?
-  Yes.

462
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,640
He left a message saying he killed the victim.

463
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,600
It's presumed that he died when he was back from the funeral.

464
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,370
Who are you?

465
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,940
I'm sorry.

466
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,770
I killed Hyun Joo.

467
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,870
I didn't mean to do it.

468
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,540
He sent a text message to his mother before he died.

469
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,040
He said that he had killed Noh Hyun Joo.

470
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,710
We found Noh Hyun Joo's mobile phone in his room.

471
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:31,670
I was told that he had chased her since last semester.

472
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,770
Chief said we should close this case...

473

and start investigating the Woohyeon-dong murder case.

What do we do?

475
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,000
Put the case file on my desk.

476
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,800
Okay.

477
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,020
Oh, my. You're still here.

-  Yes.

He consoled me when you upset me.

481
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,390

I was looking at the dog.

487
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,630
You did? Why don't you come inside?

488
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,140
I'll make you some tea.

489
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,500
I want to go in there.

490
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,210
Come on in.

491
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,170
How adorable.

492
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,170
It looks as if you were looking at your girlfriend.

493
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,470
- Pardon?
-  Why are you so startled?

494
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,370
You were watching the dog with so much affection.

495
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,040
You must like dogs.

496
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,770
Oh, that. That dog is very cute.

497
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,400
The summer vacation is coming soon. Have you completed volunteer hours?

498
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,170
No, not yet.

499
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,660
How about you help me with the volunteer work I'm doing?

500
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,070
We're shorthanded lately.

501
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,140
You can complete your volunteer hours.

502
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,570
- What do you say?
-  It sounds great.

503
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,600
I was looking for volunteer work.

504
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,330
- That's great.
-  Oh, no.

505
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,470
Where are you going?

506
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,870
Where are you going?

507
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,070
Puppy.

508
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,300
Where are you?

509
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,670
Where did it go?

510
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,140
There you are. Come here.

511
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,940
You're so adorable. Good dog.

512
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,140
Look at this.

513
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,770
Professor.

514
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,100
I'll get going now.

515
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,300
Oh, okay. Just a second.

516
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,640
Who told you you could come in here?

517
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,570
That's rude.

518
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,420
Go upstairs first.

519
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,440
Okay.

520

(Veterinary Anatomical Terminology)

522
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,460
I'll get going.

523
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,800
Okay. See you later.

524
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,300
That's him.

525
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,500
Bong Pal. Bong Pal.

526
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,570
Monk Myung Cheol.

527
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,440
Who was the man you were with in front of the animal clinic?

528
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,500
You mean the professor?

529
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,670
- Professor?
-  Yes, he's my college professor.

530
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,440
Does he live in the same apartment as you?

531
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,240
No, I think he lives in his clinic.

532
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,800
In his clinic?

533
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,200
What's the matter?

534
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,570
What? It's nothing.

535
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,680
Let's go. You're heading home, right?

536
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,440
- Yes.
-  Let's go. It's hot.

537
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,070
Can I come in?

538
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,740
Bong Pal.

539
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,650
Are you preparing for the college exam? What are these photos?

540
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,440
I lack the basic knowledge.

541
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,540
What brought you here? You didn't tell me you were coming.

542
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,000
Have I ever called you in advance?

543
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:23,800
What is it?

544
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,800
Is there something in the veranda?

545
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,640
No, nothing.

546
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,970
Has anything happened to you recently?

547
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,940
No, nothing happened.

548
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,670
Why do you ask?

549
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,840
Never mind.

550
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,270
Let me see.

551
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:56,970
Can I come in?

552
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,400
He can hear ghosts sometimes.

553
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,700
Is his father's number saved on his phone?

554
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,570
He still hasn't saved his number.

555
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,170
Wait. I found it.

00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,270
On May 13,

559
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,000
Yes?

564
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,370
When was your middle school graduation ceremony?

565
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,840
I think it was in February.

566
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,300
I guess it was. Why do you ask?

567
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,000
Nothing. Continue whatever you were doing.

568
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,700
Hello?

569
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,540
I'll be there soon.

570
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,640
I'll go somewhere and come back soon.

571
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,140
Okay.

572
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,200
The graduation ceremony...

573
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,140
What happened at the graduation ceremony?

574
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,540
Oh, right. He recorded the ceremony.

575
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,200
I saw him filming with a camera.

576
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,400
May...

577
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,200
It was after the anniversary of Yang Soon's death in February.

578
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,870
February 24...

(February 24, 2009)

580
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,500
I found it. February 24.

581
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,870
Well...

582
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,550
Today's client is a possessed man.

583
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,760
Hyun Ji, let Bong Pal deal with him.

584
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,370
- It's dangerous.
-  Okay.

585
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,960
You're lucky. He cares about you.

586
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,530
Are you jealous?

587
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,240
What did Hyun Ji say?

588
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,530
Are you okay?

589
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,470
Stay focused. Sit up straight.

590
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,800
Hyun Ji, are you all right?

591

The graduation ceremony will begin shortly.

593
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,900
All the students and families,

594
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,470

No!

596
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,540
No!

597
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,240
No.

598
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,980
No.

No.

No!

601
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,790
My brother used to be very sick.

602
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,590
After he was fully recovered,

603
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,550
he suddenly started having seizures.

604
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,420
Hey!

605
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:00,890
What happened?

606
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,050
What's the matter?

607
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:04,990
Wait!

608
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,360
Open the door!

609
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,590
Are you all right?

610
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:12,780
Open the door!

611
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,850
- Hey!
-  What happened?

612
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,550
- What happened?
-  I have the key.

613
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,190
- No!
-  Since then,

614
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,290
he's been staying in bed.

615
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,320
He starts screaming every time he wakes up.

616
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,280
Mum thinks he's possessed.

617
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,390
I'll take a look.

618
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,220

619
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,390
No!

620
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,120
Please!

621
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,950
Please, no.

Hey.

623

- No!
-  Hey.

624
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,690
It's okay.

625
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,790
Bong Pal, look at that.

626
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,150
- It's okay.
-  She's...

627
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,550
the ghost we saw.

628
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:54,280
Was she choking my son?

629
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,120
Why is she torturing my son even after she died?

630
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,250
- My goodness.
-  Let's go in.

631
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,910
By the way, who is she?

632
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,210
She was my brother's girlfriend.

633
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,290
Then...

634
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,420
what should we do?

635
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,300
Once he falls asleep,

636
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,990
he doesn't wake up for a couple of days.

637
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,430
It'll be all right as long as he's sleeping.

638
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,820
We'll come back in a couple of days.

639
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,790
Give us a call if something happens.

640
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:24,890
I will.

641
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,950
Oh my.

642
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,520
Gosh.

643
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,620
Will I find anything in this video?

644
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,490
Bong Pal.

645
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,520
Bong Pal. Come here.

646
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,890
Smile.

647
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,890
What is he doing there?

648
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,220
Take care.

649
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:04,820
Bye.

650
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,590
- Hey.
-  Yes?

651
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,840
- Did you see that?
-  What do you mean?

652
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,790
Don't you feel anything after seeing him?

653
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,420
- No.
-  No?

654
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,390
You completely lost your mind.

655
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,500
Look.

656
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,050
That's what happens when you fall for a ghost.

657
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,320
The ghost will take away all your energy.

658
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,910
Do you want to look like a skeleton just like he does?

659
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,620
A human being and a ghost are not meant to be together.

660
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:40,090
Lower your voice. Hyun Ji will hear you.

661
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,890
Did she hear it?

662
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,550
Of course, she did. How could she not hear that?

663
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:55,820
I'm sorry.

664
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,520

665
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520
Here.

666
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,350
Let's go home.

667
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,050
Bong Pal.

668
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:39,890
Will we be all right?

669
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:43,690
People will think...

670
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,420
our relationship is...

671
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,190
absurd.

672
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,950
I like you.

673
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,920
I don't care what others think.

674
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,390
You're the one I like.

675
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,490
(Bring it on, Ghost)

676
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,320
- You're so ugly.
-  Stop it.

677
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,490
Someday, we'll break up like everyone else, right?

678
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,620
Bong Pal, who are you talking to?

679
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,050
This time, it's a ghost that appears in a school.

680
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
Apparently, it has a very weird appearance.

681
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,480
It's from my middle school graduation ceremony.

682
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,120
Why was Monk Myung Cheol watching it?

683
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,020
Do you have Ju Hye Sung's mother's address?

684
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,950
What happened?

685
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:48,620
After killing his girlfriend, he killed himself out of guilt.

686
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,850
How can you love a ghost?

687
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:54,490
Bong Pal, I want you to be happy.

688
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,220
Hyun Ji!

689
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,990
Kim Hyun Ji!
