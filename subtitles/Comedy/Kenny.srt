1
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,879
MAN: Right, sorry,
so the show's on the 16th.

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,120
And what... Is it a festival, is it?

3
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,359
How many people
would you expect from...

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,879
From start to finish, how many people
would you expect?

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,359
We'll say 4,000?

6
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,200
Keep it going.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,119
No worries. Now, is alcohol being
served at the event?

8
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,640
No, it's all being charged.
It's a bar, is it?

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,840
Uh, is there food...
is there food being served?

10
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,560
Good quality food,
or probably just junk food?

11
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,079
Chips and... pizzas. Yeah.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,079
And, uh, have you got any
Indonesian foods or curries?

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,439
You have? Alright.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,120
Well, normally, if it was
a non-drinking event,

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,599
as far as alcohol,

16
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,439
and there was
no food or curries,

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
for 4,000 people for 10 hours,

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,879
you'd have five male
and five female blocks.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,879
But you've got alcohol
being served,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,480
as well as the food and you've got
curries in there as well,

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,200
which does make
a bit of a difference.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,200
And on the, uh... on the solid
to water-based

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,519
or liquid waste ratio,

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,040
you've got a 4 to 1.

25
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,760
So it's basically
four liquid to one solid.

26
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,640
That's the piss and shit ratio, yeah.

27
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,519
People... I must admit,
when people find out what I do,

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,200
I mean, when they ask
what I do, I say I'm a plumber,

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,359
and they say, "Well,
that'd be pretty interesting",

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,840
and I say,
"Well, not that interesting,

31
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,760
" 'cause all I plumb
is shithouses."

32
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,000
As you can see,
we've got a lot of blocks here.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,519
We've just gotta find
one more combo unit

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,040
and we're on our way.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,799
Where is the bastard?

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,639
How do you lose a 40ft toilet?

37
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,520
Yeah, most people...
they always freak out

38
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,719
because, of course, they think
you're handling the stuff.

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,960
They think... I don't know
whether they think I eat it

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
or whether they think
I scrub it on meself.

41
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,560
You know, I plumb it.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
See? Here's another
classic example.

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,599
Someone having
a 2-inch arsehole

44
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,280
and us only having installed
1-inch piping.

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,479
As much as people think
you're covered in shit and piss,

46
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,479
you're not.

47
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,639
It's 85% of it's water.

48
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,039
85 and in some instances
up to 90% water.

49
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,520
I know that leaves around

50
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,560
about 10% to 15%
of shit and piss,

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,120
but there's some chemicals
in there that work on that.

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,319
See, this is what we spend
half our time cleaning up.

53
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,800
How hard is it?

54
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,479
I mean, I don't mean to be
straight up about it,

55
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,960
but, I mean, there's a urinal -

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,360
you stand here
and, being a male,

57
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,800
you've got a prong on you
which points forward,

58
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,240
so I don't understand
how they get it under their feet.

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,520
They must point it down.

60
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,800
The funny part is,
parents look at me, you know,

61
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,080
and say, "Well, that's not
much of a job, is it?

62
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,680
"Did you wish
you did something else?"

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I said, "Well, you had kids.

64
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,840
"You spent the first two years
handling their shit.

65
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,560
"And you weren't
getting paid for that."

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,719
And they're...they shit green.

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,439
Only thing
that's supposed to be green

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,319
is apples, pears and Martians.

69
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,400
Stay there.

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,439
Yo!

71
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,960
That's the one.

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,919
Pretty lonely old job, this.

73
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,000
We're here before
the crowds get here

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,800
and we're the last to leave.

75
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,840
We miss out on all the fun,
don't we, Alf?

76
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,879
Yeah.

77
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,919
Yeah, shut her off, Alfie,
she's all done, mate.

78
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,680
Just make sure you stock up
all the poo tickets, boys.

79
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,879
This one's gonna get
a flogging today.

80
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, well, this is where most of the
paperwork gets done,

81
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
obviously.

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,560
This is the... realistically, the sciatic
nerve of Splashdown.

83
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,120
What we do, normally
it's corporate bathroom rentals.

84
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,759
I mean, at the end of the day,

85
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,840
it's just a fancy way of having
somewhere to shit, isn't it?

86
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Having a nice place to purge.

87
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,680
But, uh, I mean,
other companies...

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,560
Up in Sydney there's one
that has a slogan -

89
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,040
`We're number one
with your number twos'.

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,639
I prefer not to spend
too long in the office.

91
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,120
I prefer working outside,

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,360
but this is obviously where the real
business end gets done,

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,399
so to speak.

94
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,519
Doesn't matter
how big the event is

95
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,120
or how important the event is,

96
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,319
be it a corporate event
or a concert,

97
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,319
you would think that
we'd be the first thing

98
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,800
that people would think of

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,879
because it's the one thing
everyone does on most days -

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,879
a la me, 10am, every morning,
regular as clockwork.

101
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,360
It's never the first thing
on their mind,

102
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,680
when, realistically, it should be
the first thing they think of,

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,240
because if we don't turn up,

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
grab the business
and get going with it,

105
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,319
well, they really are in the shit,
aren't they?

106
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,399
We've got a bit of a drive here

107
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,399
because we've gotta
drop this load off

108
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,399
at mama and papa poo
in Werribee.

109
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,959
Funny thing is, a lot of people
use the word 'shit' now

110
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,920
of course as an abusive word,
you know, as a swear word -

111
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,920
the sort of word you wanna
keep away from kiddies.

112
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,360
But the funny part is,
where it came from

113
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,600
was when they started to transport
manure in the ships

114
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
so they could use it
to fertilise gardens.

115
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,120
Problem was, moisture
would get in from the boat,

116
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,600
into the bottom of the boat

117
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,560
and mix up with some of the manure
they were transporting,

118
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,560
and it would start to ferment
and it would cause a gas,

119
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,040
and the problem was

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,839
if someone went down there
with a candle

121
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,240
or lit a match or had a pipe
or something down there,

122
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,920
sometimes it ignited and there was an
explosion on the boat.

123
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,399
After that,
they put all the crap in boxes

124
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,800
and it had 'SHIT'
written on the side of the box

125
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,480
and that stood for
'Store High In Transit'.

126
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
And that's where
it got its name from.

127
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,800
So... I don't know
whether there's any truth

128
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,279
to that story or not,

129
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,000
but it's a pretty elaborate,
you know, lie.

130
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Bit of a long-winded set-up if
someone's made that story up.

131
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,639
I'm going with it.

132
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,279
Yeah, so, I'm having to work
a little bit of overtime tonight

133
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,480
just to get a couple
of extra toilets ready.

134
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,480
We've got a heap of them
going out next week.

135
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,279
As you can see, the kids...
I don't know what they do.

136
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,720
They've broken through
that one. They do all sorts...

137
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,040
Oh, have a look at this one.
You won't believe this.

138
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,480
Have a look at this. This one
I replaced this morning.

139
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
Look at that! Eh?

140
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,240
What kind of curry
has that bloke been eating?

141
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,519
Devil's curry.
Hell's teeth, I tell you.

142
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,000
I've never understood why
people all carry on about it.

143
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,079
I... I enjoy a good crap,
to be quite honest.

144
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,360
I not only enjoy it, I love it.

145
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,279
I don't think
it's all pain and anger.

146
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,000
Me, personally, I sit on a toilet
for 20-odd minutes,

147
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,480
as most men can.

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,079
Do you know,
it's an interesting fact,

149
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,560
as far as smells,

150
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,800
apparently your body
only is in shock -

151
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,360
and sometimes it is shock -

152
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,160
for about the first 7 to 12 seconds or
something,

153
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,240
and after that you get
used to it very quickly.

154
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,199
That's why a man can read

155
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,879
a newspaper or magazine
from front to back,

156
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,120
you know, in the toilet, in his own
smell, and not notice it.

157
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,920
Mind you,
the next person that walks in

158
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,639
will think they've been smacked in the
head

159
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,639
with a poo bat.

160
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,759
But, uh, I don't know,
you know...

161
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,079
If a woman walks in after you,
kill 'em. Knock 'em in half.

162
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,639
I've always understood
that people...

163
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,759
I know everyone does get
embarrassed by taking a crap.

164
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,439
You wouldn't wanna be doing it
in the middle of Bourke Street,

165
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,040
butt-naked,
trying to poo into a cup.

166
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,959
I mean, even dogs...
if you watch a dog crap,

167
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,519
even a dog's embarrassed
to do poos.

168
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,000
You know when
they're doing a poo,

169
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,439
they're all bent over like they're
trying to root a cricket ball,

170
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,920
but even they... even they
get embarrassed.

171
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,000
And that's a dog.
And they'll eat it!

172
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,000
This is, uh... What am I
down to? Four strings.

173
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,519
I was given this guitar
by a mate of mine.

174
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,240
He used to play a bit of music.

175
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,080
And he had a bit of an accident.

176
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,159
And, uh... his job,
he was working,

177
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,960
got his hand crushed
in a machine.

178
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
He couldn't play
the guitar anymore, so...

179
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,559
..he gave me this.

180
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,720
And I always swore
I'd learn to play the guitar

181
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,039
but I haven't really learnt.

182
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,039
The only thing I've learnt is that
if I hit the strings really hard,

183
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,559
they break.

184
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,039
I think it takes a certain
kind of person to do what I do

185
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,159
and it's just about having
a thick skin.

186
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
No-one's ever impressed
with what you do.

187
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,679
No-one's ever fascinated

188
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,120
or no-one ever wants to come
and see what you do, or...

189
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,720
I imagine, if you were a fireman,

190
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,399
all the kids would want to jump
on the back of the truck

191
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,840
and follow you to a fire.

192
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,679
There's gonna be no kids
keen to do that.

193
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,519
I don't do it for the glory.
I don't do it to impress people.

194
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,279
It's a job. But, you know,
it's... it's what I know.

195
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,919
It's my trade.

196
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,759
And I actually think
I'm pretty good at it.

197
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,360
That's not bad stuff, that.

198
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
As you can see, I've got
a few different aftershaves,

199
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,799
which obviously,
in my line of work,

200
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,759
doesn't hurt to have
a few of those on hand.

201
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,279
A bit of an arsenal.

202
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,559
These are, uh... a mate of mine,

203
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,759
he's over in Japan
at the moment.

204
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,240
You should have
a look at these.

205
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,960
These are pictures...
they're pictures of a toilet.

206
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
They must stand over it.

207
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,879
God knows
how they keep that clean.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,519
Over here, you sit right on
the pan and they still miss it.

209
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,000
How would you be...?

210
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,480
There's Robbo's feet there. See?

211
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Look at this thing here. It's out of 'Star
Wars' or something.

212
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,679
This is the toilet here.

213
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,159
And see the armrest?

214
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,600
That's the control panel for it.

215
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,759
He hasn't explained
what they all are.

216
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,159
But it's got
two different settings

217
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,200
for a water jet
to shoot up your date -

218
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,919
must be to wash it
or something.

219
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,879
This must be the heater,
or God knows what that is.

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
And, jeez, look at this.

221
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,919
This has got a speed dial.

222
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,399
And I don't know what that is,

223
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,559
whether it's a television
or it takes an X-ray of your...

224
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,960
You know, I tell you what,
this'll be the future.

225
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,919
We'll all be sitting
on space-age shitters.

226
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,279
Not one single photo
of his holiday trip.

227
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,159
I wouldn't have a clue
where he's been,

228
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,919
but I know he's had two craps.

229
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,200
MAN: What's the go
with putting the toilets

230
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,679
outside of the venue?

231
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,919
Well, that was where we were
told to put it originally.

232
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,399
Not on the drawing.

233
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,320
Well... even though
it's on the outside of the fence,

234
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,799
the fence has been moved

235
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,639
from where I was told
it was gonna be.

236
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,879
I can't move it now.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,919
You'd have to be
Andre the Giant to lift it up.

238
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,559
It's a couple of tonne a unit.

239
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,279
Well, can we get it sorted
by the end of today, or...?

240
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,039
Well, to do it,
I'll have to unplumb it,

241
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,519
turn the water off, get a crane.

242
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean, I can have a go.

243
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,799
You want me to ring the boss?
- Yes.

244
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,840
Alright, I'll ring Glenn
and I'll come and see you.

245
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,480
Are you at the manager's hut?
Yep.

246
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,039
Or I'm on a two-way.
Just please get hold of me.

247
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,720
Alright. Done.
Thank you.

248
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,120
Jeez, this'll be great.
He wants us to move the toilet.

249
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,039
Well, they reckon we've put
the toilet in the wrong spot.

250
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I didn't drop it off -
Tom did.

251
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,759
But it's just outside
the front fence,

252
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,200
which is where I thought
it was supposed to go.

253
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,480
MAN ON P.A.:
The F-111 lands...

254
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
( MOBILE PHONE RINGS )

255
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,519
This could be
a little bit colourful.

256
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,039
That's from me... me ex-wife.

257
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,360
We're separated.

258
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,320
Apparently, me little boy's
putting on a bit of a show.

259
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,320
I have to give her a ring.
I won't be...

260
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,840
Yeah. Don't yell in the phone.

261
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,960
What...what...
what has he called you?

262
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,039
Oh, jeez. Well, do you want to
put him on the phone to me?

263
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,759
Yeah, well, oh,
it's a bit different.

264
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,519
I'm a grown-up, mate.
You're still a boy.

265
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,200
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to pull
your head in a bit.

266
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,600
You can't be carrying on
like a bloody raw prawn.

267
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
Alright.

268
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,480
Yeah, well, maybe just
steady on a bit, eh?

269
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,279
Just try and pull it up a bit.

270
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,600
No, I understand that, but she's still
your mother, mate.

271
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,279
It doesn't matter what I say.

272
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,679
Yeah, I know I said that, but
we were a bit heated that day.

273
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,000
There's no need to be repeating that.

274
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
Alright, well, just try
and settle down a bit.

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,720
No, mate, the first time
I ever saw

276
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,679
Glenn shove his hand
down a bowl,

277
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,080
and that's the owner
of this company,

278
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
turned up in a suit, mate,

279
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,399
he ripped his shirt off,

280
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,200
straight into the shit.

281
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,759
And I got there, and I said,

282
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,399
"There's fuckin' a man
after my own heart

283
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,879
"that'll do anything."

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,360
His arm's into it.

285
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,960
It's nice to have
a boss that knows

286
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,159
what we're going
through at last.

287
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,159
Do you know, I sometimes feel
a bit lucky that I've got this job.

288
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,720
In this job, I must admit,

289
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,120
I've had a chance to see
some great stuff.

290
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,000
And I work with
a good bunch of blokes.

291
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,639
And, you know, that's more than
anyone can ask for.

292
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,799
I tell you what, Robbo, do you mind if I
lob here tonight?

293
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,639
I'll have a few more beers.
I don't give a shit at all, mate.

294
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,240
Eh, you can even
stay in that bed,

295
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,840
and I'll make a bed
up for myself...

296
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,639
No, no. I'm not gonna stay in your bed,
Robbo. It's your joint.

297
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,559
Ah, well, there's
no problems, brother.

298
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,960
There's a lounge there.
There's a bed there.

299
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,399
Hey, no worries.
You've got the whole lot.

300
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,200
You know, the funny part is

301
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,480
everyone will deny the fact
that they look at their poo,

302
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,960
but everyone does.

303
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,600
The ancient Greeks...

304
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
Cop this one.

305
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,960
The ancient Greeks,
they used to use poo, back in...

306
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,600
I mean, talking 2,000 years ago,
when Christ was alive.

307
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,840
They used to look at their poo,
or people's poo

308
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,120
to forecast the future.

309
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,360
Mind you, if they'd seen
some of the poo I've seen

310
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,360
at some of the festivals,
the future looks pretty bleak.

311
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,360
But they used to use it
to forecast the future,

312
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,879
back 2,000 years ago.

313
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,759
Hey, Darren, have you got power to
those toilets

314
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,759
across there yet?

315
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,679
This is the busiest time of year.

316
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,159
This is the crazy time.

317
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,759
Obviously,
when the sun comes out,

318
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,240
every bastard has a festival,

319
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,080
and we get flogged
like crooked dogs in a...

320
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,559
It's a mongrel.

321
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,799
It just goes bonkers. It's as silly
as a bum full of Smarties.

322
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,799
I often sing
'Advance Australia Fair'.

323
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,720
There's nothing wrong with
having a bit of national pride.

324
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,159
Problem is,
when I first heard it,

325
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,159
I used to think the song was,
the words were,

326
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,399
"Australians all
let us ring Joyce,

327
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,639
" 'cause she is young
and free."

328
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,879
So, obviously, I was making
a goose of myself,

329
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,080
right up until the old man
set me straight on the words.

330
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,879
I sing it right now.

331
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,159
"Australians all
let us ring Joyce."

332
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,120
God.

333
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,200
You know, I get to see
some great stuff doing this job.

334
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,679
And it's never boring.

335
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,039
But, I mean, you know,
I hear of people all the time

336
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,039
and you read about it -

337
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,519
people sitting behind
their desk at work

338
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,799
terrified that the next day
they're gonna be out of work.

339
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,639
Well, that's not something
I've ever gotta worry about.

340
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,120
You know, it's not like
my business

341
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,799
is gonna dry up
overnight, is it?

342
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,279
How you been? Well?
Excellent.

343
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,759
I haven't seen you forever.

344
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,399
I'll catch up with you there.
OK.

345
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,919
See you, mate.
See you.

346
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,360
That's a mate from school.

347
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,960
That's a guy
I went to school with.

348
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,399
That's Macka.

349
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,240
I must admit, I thought
you'd got a bit taller

350
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,240
since I'd seen you,

351
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
but you've got
these bloody boots on.

352
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,559
They're different from the footy
boots you strapped on

353
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,399
when we were at school, mate.

354
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,080
There's not too much I regret
about doing this job.

355
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,559
I think I've worked
a lot of hours,

356
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,240
and it's probably
aged me a bit.

357
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
You know, some of my mates
reckon I'm looking a bit worn.

358
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,799
Well, I lost my missus.

359
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,399
I lost her out of it.

360
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,919
That was... Well, I didn't
lose her. I know where she is.

361
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,399
She just left me, but, uh...

362
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,960
..it bit me on the arse pretty hard when
she was leaving me.

363
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,840
You know, it was one tax l
didn't expect to pay in this job,

364
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,320
and that was losing me missus.

365
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,639
But when you spend more time
with other people's poo

366
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,039
than you do your own wife,
you've gotta pay the penalty.

367
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,240
MAN: Do you know that
70% of marriages fail? 70%.

368
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,640
I mean, you hear of so many stories of
that whole...

369
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,720
..that same scenario.

370
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,279
You know, you get married

371
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,279
and a week later
they break up or something

372
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,759
or, you know, it doesn't work.

373
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
Or, you know, sex doesn't
happen or something.

374
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,559
Or, you know,
she goes off you or something.

375
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,599
Or, you know, the parents
are around every day

376
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,599
or something.

377
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,400
Or you can't support them,
give them what they want,

378
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,960
because they came from,
you know,

379
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,759
a wealthier background
or something than you,

380
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,039
and you're wishing
that you could, you know,

381
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,319
support it more than that,
but you can't,

382
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,920
because you just...you can't.

383
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,799
I always get a little bit nervous

384
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,359
when Pat comes in
for one of his little chats.

385
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
Sadly, Pat's chosen to learn
from my life's mistakes

386
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,640
instead of learning
from his own.

387
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,960
-So... you still loved her
in the end?

388
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,480
-Or did you...?

389
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,319
Oh, it was a little bit hard to
love someone that hates you.

390
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,319
Yeah.

391
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,319
Don't worry too much.

392
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,000
If you worry too much,
you'll drive yourself mad.

393
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,599
By the time you cut
the wedding cake,

394
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,599
you'll cut the table in half,
you'll be that nervous.

395
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,400
A wedding is an "I do" kind of day.
That's all your pressure is.

396
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,880
Remember that - "I do."

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,279
Do you want to marry this woman till
the rest of your life?

398
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,279
"I do."

399
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,920
Are you ready
to go to the park?

400
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,920
Do you want to have
photos taken next to her

401
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:10,960
now that you've married her?

402
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:11,960
"I do."

403
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,440
Do you want to go
on the honeymoon

404
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,920
and do the horizontal
folk dance?

405
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,240
"Yes, love, I do."

406
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,079
Just, all you've gotta
remember is "I do".

407
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,960
There's no pressure,
you know?

408
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,119
If you think of it like that,
then it's not that big a deal...

409
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
..unless a bloke comes down
in the wedding dress,

410
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,759
then you'll know
your day's gone to shit.

411
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,680
But that's not gonna
happen, is it?

412
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,720
I don't know whether
I'm necessarily the right person

413
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:36,440
to be asking about all this,
to tell you the truth, Pat.

414
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,319
Mine failed.
I don't...you know

415
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
I once heard a guy say,

416
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,440
"Cut out the middle man -

417
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
"find someone you hate
and give them a house."

418
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,319
Now, if you want to
be negative about it,

419
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,799
that's the way you'd look at it.

420
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,680
You've been there.
I haven't been there yet.

421
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,160
You've been through that.

422
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,119
I mean, I'm asking you
because you...

423
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,599
..you were there for 14 years.

424
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,279
But that's...
that was my missus.

425
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,000
You're gonna marry
someone different.

426
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,000
And that's...

427
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,480
If you were gonna
marry my ex-wife,

428
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,480
I'd have a ton of stuff
to tell you.

429
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,039
Is this the right person?
Is this the right time?

430
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,640
Is this the right...?

431
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,839
Hello.
WOMAN: Yeah, come in.

432
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,440
Yeah, it's only me.

433
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,759
How are you?
- Yeah, OK.

434
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,200
It's a fair old day outside,
isn't it?

435
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,160
There's the boy.
How are you, boy? You right?

436
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,839
You right to go?

437
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,240
All good. You've got some
stuff packed and a towel?

438
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,759
Alright.

439
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,680
Well, we'll get going, eh?
We'll hit the road.

440
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,160
What do you say, mate?

441
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,519
We'll be back,
well, I don't know what time.

442
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,720
We're just gonna head off
down the beach now.

443
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,599
So...
- I need him back by 4:00.

444
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm sorry?
- I need him back by 4:00.

445
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,920
What? Well, it's midday now.

446
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,960
How am I gonna have him back
by four o'clock?

447
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,960
I've got plans.
I need him back by 4:00.

448
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,960
Look, you want to
jump in the car, mate?

449
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,799
Grab your toy there.
Jump in the car.

450
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,799
I'll be one sec.

451
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,799
I'm just gonna have
a little chat to your mother.

452
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
It would've been nice
to have known this

453
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,400
at 8:00 this morning
when I rang.

454
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,039
We're going down
to Ocean Grove.

455
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,279
It'll take me an hour and a half
to get there.

456
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,519
I don't give a shit.
I need him back at 4:00.

457
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,559
We're just taking him down
to see his grandfather.

458
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,079
If I've got him back by 4:00,

459
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
we'll only spend
30 minutes there.

460
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,039
It would've been nice
to have known this

461
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,039
this morning, though.

462
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,519
I'm taking the boy
down to see his grandfather,

463
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,279
not that you seem to be
too plussed about that.

464
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,759
Alright.

465
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,440
Jesus Christ.

466
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,559
Hey, do you want to
jump in the front

467
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,960
with your old man, mate?

468
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,799
You don't want to
jump up the front there?

469
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,319
We've got the front seat.
You can sit up with me and...

470
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,799
Alright. Well, please yourself.

471
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,599
You're right
in the back there, then?

472
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,880
Alright.

473
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,960
How you been, mate?
You been good?

474
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,319
Hey? Well, er, we'll get you
down to your grandad's.

475
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,119
We're just gonna go down to
Ocean Grove, to the beach.

476
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,359
You like it down at the beach,
don't you, mate?

477
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,839
What do you say, eh?

478
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,240
Dad, are you going to hell?

479
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,680
Am I going to hell?

480
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,839
Well, no, I'm not going to hell.
Not as far as I know.

481
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,319
Why's that?

482
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,359
Because Mum said... Mum said you
don't believe in God.

483
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,759
Mum said
I don't believe in God?

484
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,480
And that's why
I'm going to hell?

485
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,559
Well, mate, er...
Look, I tell you what.

486
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,960
When God introduces
himself to me,

487
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,359
I'll give him my full attention.

488
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,319
I'll give him 150%, mate.

489
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,440
But until then,
I'm just a little bit busy.

490
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,799
Jesus, and I'm going to hell,
she reckons.

491
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,960
(Sighs)

492
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,640
To be quite honest,
I think I'm already in it.

493
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,240
(Mutters) Am I going to hell!

494
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,920
(Giggles)
(Sings) # Australians all

495
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,319
# Let us ring Joyce

496
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,240
(Both sing) # For she
is young and free

497
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,720
# She's free... #

498
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,200
(Boy giggles)

499
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,640
You know, if my son
ended up doing this job,

500
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,160
I don't think
I'd be that upset by that.

501
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,640
If he was happy,

502
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,240
and he had good people around him

503
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,839
Iike I've got good people around me,

504
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,319
and he's making OK money

505
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,640
and he's proud of
what he does as a trade -

506
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,359
'cause, don't forget,
it is a trade...

507
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,359
Hello?

508
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,920
..I'd be stoked for him.

509
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,759
You there, Dad?
Hey, mate, how are you going?

510
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,359
Oh, you made it, I see.

511
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,400
I did. Good to see you again.

512
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,319
Say hello to
your grandfather, son.

513
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,240
You better... Wait on, boy.
Take your shoes off.

514
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,799
You might have to
pop them off.

515
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,759
You'd better get yours off too.
- Alright. We'll pop them off.

516
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:22,640
Right.

517
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,680
Have you been well?
Oh, yeah. Listen...

518
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,599
Eh, eh, just before...
No, wait on.

519
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,279
I've just had that scotchguarded there.

520
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,720
You'd better get these off.
You'd better get these off.

521
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,799
Well, they're clean.
I mean, I haven't been...

522
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
I've only dropped
into the office this morning.

523
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,400
There's no business on them.

524
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,880
I'm actually going to
a job tonight.

525
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,759
Well, they don't look
too flash to me.

526
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,359
Get them off. I'll get you...

527
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,200
I've got something
you can wear. Here, I've got...

528
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,720
Get them off, would you?

529
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,759
Well, I can't run around
in me jocks, Dad.

530
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,759
No, well, I've got something.

531
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,599
I've got a gown here
you can put on.

532
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,079
No-one's gonna see you.

533
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,519
For Christ's sake.
Just take them off.

534
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,200
Jesus Christ.

535
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,720
Well, what am I gonna wear?

536
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,640
I've got a gown here.
I've got a gown, I said.

537
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,039
So what else is news, Dad?
What have you been doing?

538
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,119
Oh, not a lot. There's not
a lot to do down here.

539
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,000
It goes past with
monotonous regularity.

540
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,960
Just don't take your foot off the thing.
Just let me move that up.

541
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,960
Sure.

542
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,759
I'll get a couple of coasters there for...

543
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,119
Won't be a tick.
- Alright.

544
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,400
There you go, young fella.
Don't... Try not to spill that.

545
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,960
Just keep...
keep your eye on him.

546
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,440
He'll be right, Dad.

547
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,319
There you go, son.
There's your water for you.

548
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,720
I'll give you a tea.
I'm a bit light on for coffee.

549
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,440
My pension doesn't come through till
next week.

550
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,799
Did you ring that bloke that
I told you to ring about the job?

551
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,599
No, I didn't...
No, I haven't rung him.

552
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,119
Why not?

553
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,559
He's a good mate of mine.
Why didn't you ring him?

554
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,799
I'm not saying he's not
a good mate of yours, Dad.

555
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,359
It's just I don't need
to ring him. I've got a job.

556
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,359
Yeah, but I'm talking
about a real job.

557
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,880
I'm talking about a real job.

558
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,720
I've got a real job, Dad.
I'm a plumber.

559
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,880
Yeah, plumber, my arse.
I know what you are.

560
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,000
Here, young fella.

561
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,519
You better go outside
and eat that.

562
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,880
I don't want you dropping crumbs all
over the floor.

563
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,359
Sit on... outside.

564
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,519
Take your hat, mate, so...

565
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,559
You might get
a bit of sun out there.

566
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,240
Pop your hat on too, eh?

567
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm a little...a little
disappointed in you, son.

568
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,400
In me? Disappointed...
disappointed with what?

569
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,160
It's a full-time job, Dad.

570
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,640
I'm working
six to seven days a week

571
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,519
and I'm pulling in over $1,200.

572
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,400
Yeah, what, a full-time job?

573
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,920
I didn't put you through school

574
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,599
for you to become
a fuckin' glorified turd burglar,

575
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,400
and that's all you
fuckin' well are!

576
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm a plumber, Dad.
I'm a plumber.

577
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,599
Oh, plumber, my arse!

578
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,279
Don't say this stuff
in front of the boy.

579
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,039
I won't say it in front of him.
That's why I sent him outside.

580
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,519
I'm not a ding-a-ling.

581
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,759
You never see a man,
you never come to see me

582
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,000
and when you come here,
all you wanna do is argue.

583
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,839
I don't wanna argue.
I've just got a job.

584
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,279
As soon as you can accept
that I've got a full-time job...

585
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,880
I thought you'd be glad
to see me.

586
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
I am glad to see you, Dad.

587
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,119
I've just driven down here to...
Of course I'm glad to see you.

588
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,720
And the lad's growing up.

589
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,960
The last time I saw him,
he was about this high,

590
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,200
and have a look at him now -
he's nearly fuckin' 6ft.

591
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,720
You don't bring him
near the place.

592
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,519
What, are you ashamed of me
or something?

593
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,119
Of course I'm not
ashamed of you, Dad.

594
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,079
Aw, it gives me the shits,
it does, boy.

595
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,079
You've never appreciated
anything I've done for you.

596
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Oh, it's not about
appreciation, Dad.

597
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,240
I'll just wash this cup.

598
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,160
Pop your shoes on, mate.

599
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,680
Here, young fella. Here.

600
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,680
Put that in your kick and
be good to your dad, alright?

601
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,160
Here, give us a cuddle.

602
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,960
Thank Grandad for
the 20 cents. Say thank you...

603
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,440
Thank you.
- Alright.

604
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,480
Off you go. I wanna have
a talk to your father.

605
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:39,160
Keep your eye on the boy and
don't have him running round

606
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,599
like a wild navvy,
for Christ's sake.

607
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,839
I never let you get away
with any of those things.

608
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,839
If you don't rule them
with a rod of iron,

609
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,680
they'll make an arsehole of you
out in public

610
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,240
when you take them out.

611
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,720
He's alright.
Yeah, he's alright.

612
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,240
Well, keep him that way.

613
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,960
Alright, well, I'll see you again.
Alright.

614
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,960
Don't make it so long next time,
for Christ's sake.

615
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,240
A man never sees you.
You never come to visit me.

616
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,119
I'll see you soon.
As soon as I've finished...

617
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,599
And if you get a chance,
ring that bloke about that job.

618
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,960
It won't happen, Dad.
Good to see you.

619
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,559
Alright. See you.

620
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,759
(mutters indistinctly)

621
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,279
Righto.

622
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,359
One! Two! Three!

623
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,839
Move!

624
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,079
I mean, this is kind of
my outlet, you know?

625
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,240
On the job sometimes, you know, you
get a few smarties -

626
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,519
you know, a couple of
clever dicks on the job

627
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,119
that always wanna have
a go at you.

628
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,000
And, you know,
they're all full of Dutch courage

629
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,440
and got themselves full
of the Batman juice.

630
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,200
So I started doing this
as a little bit of insurance,

631
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,839
a bit of self-insurance.

(speaks unintelligibly)

635
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,359
What's that?
A little bit quicker, mate.

636
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,359
(speaks unintelligibly)
A little bit quicker!

637
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,400
(speaks unintelligibly)

638
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,000
The only hard bit sometimes
is, with the head gear on,

639
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,240
plus I'm actually
slightly deaf in one ear -

640
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,720
my right side...

Hook - right hand!
What?

643
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,519
Hook - right hand!
Right. Sorry.

644
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,799
Takes it out of me, this, but I do
enjoy doing it, the old boxing.

645
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,119
Beat the shit out of each other
and get back to work.

646

I don't make the rules up.
I don't make the plans.

647
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,079
We get all given the same map.

648
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,559
You've gotta be
more conscious

649
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,160
of what other guys
are doing, mate.

650
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,000
You want three units, so we'll need to
get that truck in there.

WOMAN: The toilet over there
is disgusting.

652
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,599
There's piss all over the walls.

653
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,720
It's gross. You really should
try and maintain them.

654

PAT: You'd think it'd be
a simple thing.

655
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,079
150 bucks a head. $150.

656
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,759
I kind of think what I could do
with $150 for 200 people.

657
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,279
Which way? Over this way?

Sorry. I'm actually here with...

I'm here with
the...toilet company.

Sorry, love.

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,200
I didn't see anything,

You know, I wouldn't mind...

They could shit on the floor,
I can cope with that.

667

This is what annoys me
the most - this stuff.

What a claim to fame that is.

672
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,720
Imagine if he went to, er...

673
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,519
Imagine if he got
to the Eiffel Tower.

674
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,160
He'd want a golden handshake,

675
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,720
a fuckin' brass band
and a fireworks show.

676

This is his claim to fame.
He's been to our shitter.

Listen, mate.
I need you down at the block.

681
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,400
A bit of a situation here.
We've got... (Voice breaks up)

682
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,640
I can't hear you. You're breaking up.

683
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,319
I need you here
to have a look and...

684
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,359
I'll be there in a minute.
Just hang on a second.

685
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,880
Jeez.

686
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,359
Just found him here.

687
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,279
See if you can...

688
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,079
..undo that chain.

689

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,359
Can you...? Hey, mate?
You alright?

692
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,240
How are you going? Wake up, tiger.

693

Hang on, hang on.

695
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,279
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

696
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,960
KENNY: Jesus. Well, he was passed out
when we got here.

697
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,839
He wasn't even awake so we
had to kind of wake him up.

698
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,720
And as soon as
we woke him up,

699
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,279
and he realised
that he was chained

700
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,759
and handcuffed to the toilet,

701
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,319
he just went berserk.

702
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,319
(Yells) Peter!

703
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,160
I don't know. Maybe he's on drugs or
something.

704
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,920
He was jumping round
like a fish.

705
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,920
MAN: You bastards!

706
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,079
No, no, it's... He's on
a bucks night or something.

707
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,759
He's probably got
some mates here somewhere.

708
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
They've drawn on him
with texta.

Listen, I've got my own car here,
alright? I drove here.

713
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,319
I drove here by myself.

714

715
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,599
Simon!

716
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,599
Sandra's gonna kill me.

717
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,799
Sandra's gonna kill me!

718
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,279
Funny, isn't it?

719
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,279
Of all the people
I could have had with me

720
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,279
while I was witnessing

721

gone wrong...

724
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,240
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home!

725
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:43,039
I will hear about this
for the next fortnight.

726
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,359
Have a good night, fellas.
Thanks, fellas.

727
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,440
This is just what you guys needed
tonight, wasn't it?

728
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,960
FIREMAN: Exactly! (Laughs)

729
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,440
You didn't see anything at all?

730
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,720
PAT: No, I walked in
and saw him.

731
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,079
Ugh!

732
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,119
Jeez. Oh!

733
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,079
What's the weather like
down there, Kenny?

734
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, yeah, it's great, Sammy.
It's great.

735
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,759
What's this Pat's bloody story?
- Eh?

736
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,559
Oh, he's giving me
the shits lately.

737
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,119
What are you...? Huh?
- Pat.

738
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,200
It doesn't actually take
a genius at times

739
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,799
to figure out
who are the square pegs

740
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,279
in a room full of round holes.

741
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,640
We've got a new guy, Sammy,
who started with us.

742
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,799
Nice bloke.

743
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,799
He's a hard worker,
there's no doubt about that,

744
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,319
but he's hard work.

745
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,920
Always going on
about this bloody marriage

746
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,400
and, "Is this gonna go right?"

747
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,920
or "Is that gonna go
bloody right?"

748
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,440
Is he gonna marry her or not?

749
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,359
I'd say so.
They've got a wedding.

750
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,200
He's either gonna marry her
or not marry her.

751
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,200
If he ain't gonna marry her,
I'll give her one.

752
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,799
Look, mate.

753
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,079
I understand
what you're saying, I really do,

754
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,640
and I am hearing you,

755
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,799
but, mate, what you've
gotta understand

756
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,559
is there is a smell in here

757
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,440
that is gonna outlast
religion, alright?

758
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,319
So can you just give me ears
a rest for a minute?

759
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,599
Just give it a break for a sec

760
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,480
and we'll talk about it
later, alright?

761
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,720
I'd appreciate it, mate.

762
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,279
Now you know how I feel.

763
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,759
Yeah, I do.

764
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,400
Just like Pat - full of shit.

765
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,680
Keep going that way,
over towards the ambulance.

766
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,319
Face it, she's had
too many drinks, mate.

767
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,240
It doesn't matter whether
she's drunk or on drugs,

768
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,720
just get her through, will you?

769
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:31,640
Just push the crowd, will you?
Just push, will you?

770
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,880
Get in front and push
the crowd out of the way.

771
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,599
I'm trying to get through
but I can't.

772
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,680
I often get nervous
on days like these

773
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,519
at these big beach festivals, you know.

774
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,160
They draw a very big crowd

775
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,160
and we quite often
have to bring in extra crew.

776
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,160
You know, with half the kids
on the wacky tobaccy

777
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,880
and the fruity disco biscuits,

778
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,799
you know, they're as mad
as a clown's cock.

779
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,480
Yeah, I am, actually.

780
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,559
I've got a little girl.
She's been into two toilets.

781
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,440
There's no toilet paper at all.
Are you doing your job here?

782
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,839
If you have a toilet, you have
to have paper, understand?

783
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,720
We do, mate. I'm sorry.
I mean, we're filming...

784
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:12,079
Don't be sorry. Don't do it again. Make
sure there's paper.

785
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,519
We'll get it fixed up for you.
I've gotta go now.

786
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,880
OK, what I'll do... Sam, I want you to
stay with Pat, OK?

787
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,839
You stay with him
for another couple of hours.

788
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,720
Have a look at this here.

789
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,480
This is half my trouble here.

790
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,559
See, he's supposed to be looking after

791
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,759
that toilet I've been getting
all the complaints about.

792
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,400
He's from university
or something.

793
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,880
He's the one that rang us

794
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,920
and said he wanted to make
a few extra bucks,

795
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,400
and look at him.

796
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,039
I've gotta tell you
something, mate.

797
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,680
I appreciate
you want some food,

798
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,160
but we've had nothing
but complaints

799
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,640
from your toilet block

800
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,720
and you're over here eating
and watching the festival.

801
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,319
I just left Dave
over there with it.

802
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,279
I just nipped over here...

803
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,799
..literally just nipped
over here for this.

804
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,680
It's been a big day for all of us.

805
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,559
I've been here since
six o'clock this morning.

806
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,440
I know you guys
come on at midday.

807
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,920
There'll be food available
later on.

808
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,519
Oh, right. No, I didn't know.

809
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,400
If you can just head
back to the toilets,

810
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,119
you're gonna need
to give them a clean.

811
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,400
You'll figure it out.

812
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,599
All you do is keep toilet paper and keep
it clean.

813
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,920
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

814
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,719
Like I said, he's probably studying to be

815
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,880
an accountant or something.

816
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,559
He can't even clean a shitter.

817
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,559
WOMAN: No.
How much longer?

818
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,400
Look, it looks clean to me.
It looks fine.

819
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,239
If you'd have seen it
five minutes ago, love,

820
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,719
you wouldn't have thought so.

821
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,760
But there you go.
Sorry about that. In you go.

822
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,920
Have a look at this.

823
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,320
Mate, I've had three complaints
about the girls toilets already.

824
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,559
There's just, like, so many people in
there at the moment,

825
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,639
I don't want to, er...
I can't really go in.

826
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,679
There's gonna be a lot of people in
there all night.

827
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,679
It's a festival.

828
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,159
Even with the girls in there?

829
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,840
That's your job. You can throw it over
the top of the door.

830
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,480
They need paper more than
they do conversation.

831
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,960
Rightio.
Alright.

832
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,000
Jeez.

833
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,000
PAT: I've just gotta talk to you
about something.

834
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,320
Yeah, what's wrong?
I've been here for 12 months.

835
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,480
He's been here for two weeks!
- Yeah.

836
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,480
And he's honestly,

837
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,960
he's constantly telling me
what to do.

838
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,519
He's really starting
to piss me off.

839
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,360
I mean, is there a hierarchy here or
something?

840
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,760
No, no, there's no hierarchy, Pat. We're
all shitkickers, mate.

841
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,559
There's no pecking order
in poo, mate.

842
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,400
Well, no, but at the same time,
you know,

843
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,639
there's a loyalty there

844
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,119
if you've been here
for two weeks,

845
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,599
or if you've been here
for 12 months.

846
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,119
I mean, he thinks
he's in charge.

847
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,280
MAN: Hey, Kenny?
Yes, mate?

848
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,280
This woman, she's lost
her ring down the toilet.

849
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,880
Which woman? Which one?

850
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,559
She's just that one over there.

851
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,039
What's she done?

852
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,800
She's lost her wedding ring
down the toilet

853
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,400
and she wants us to get it out.

854
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,880
So what do you do?

855
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,400
You'll need to deal with that.

856
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,639
Look, you head over there
and get a start on it

857
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,239
and I'll come over
and help you out.

858
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,239
But how do you...

859
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,840
Well, you've just gotta
fish it out.

860
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,440
I'll be over there
in five minutes.

861
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,679
You've gotta get in real quick, mate,
because it'll settle.

862
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,519
You've gotta get into it
pretty straightaway, mate.

863
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,039
You've had a pretty easy day.

864
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,519
You've had a good day so far

865
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,119
and this is something
you have to do.

866
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,599
We do it all the time.

867
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,199
We've promised
we're gonna get her ring

868
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
and that's what we have to do.

869
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,440
I reckon I could feel it with 
gloves if I had some gloves.

870
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,440
Mate, you're gonna have
to take my word for it.

871
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,199
If you put the gloves on,
you're not gonna feel the ring.

872
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,880
There's nothing... Mate,
it only happened a minute ago.

873
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,280
It's gonna be sitting pretty much on the
top of the pile.

874
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,760
That's why you can't
have gloves

875
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,280
or you'll push it straight into it.

876
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,159
Just bung your hand
down there and grab it,

877
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,719
and as soon as you're done,

878
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,400
we'll wash her ring, obviously,
and your hand

879
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,679
and it'll all be over.

880
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,119
It's 85% water, mate.
There's nothing to worry about.

881
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,519
I thought this would be corporate
bathrooms,

882
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,519
you know.

883
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,159
It says 'corporate bathrooms'.

884
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,719
It's only a logo.

885
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,199
I thought it'd be businessmen and stuff.

886
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,239
You reckon all the girls
on Virgin Airlines are virgins?

887
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,760
Sorry.

888
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,280
But...

889
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,159
I'll do it myself.

890
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,639
(Locks door)

891
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,639
Good luck with his
bloody degree. Jesus.

892
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:53,760
How are you going, love? Well,
there you go. We got it back.

893
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,559
That's her there.
That's your ring, isn't it?

894
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,239
That's the one. Thanks.
Fantastic.

895
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,719
Well, there you go.
OK.

896
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,199
Hang on.
You right?

897
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,679
It's a bit embarrassing.

898
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,920
No, it happens all the time.
It's not the first time.

899
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,519
I'll pop it in there for you.

900
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,000
Thanks for that.
- No worries.

901
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,599
I'll see you later, then.

902
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,000
Great, this is.

903
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,960
I've bloody... I've been
held up here

904
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,440
and now I've just found out

905
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,960
I've gotta drive the truck
back to the depot,

906
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,280
and I'm supposed to be at
my brother's birthday tonight.

907
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,840
I will say one thing,

908
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,880
and that is today's
just about got me beat.

909
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,679
I'm not exactly gonna be
the life of the party tonight.

910
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,360
Today was...

911
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,679
Today was a pretty long day.

912
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,159
Like I said, I can't let you in.

913
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,159
With what you're wearing,

914
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,760
I can't let you in there
tonight, alright?

915
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
I understand.
Well, can you go in?

916
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,679
No, I can't. I need to stay here
and look after this door.

917
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,199
I can't let you in.

918
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,400
He's just in here.

919
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,079
Sorry, can you get David?

920
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,320
Yeah, can you grab him for us?

921
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,079
One minute, mate, alright?
Just one minute.

922
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:03,559
I'll come back out once
I've found him. Thanks, mate.

923
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,880
Go home, get changed
and come back.

924
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm not introducing you
to people in fuckin' overalls.

925
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,880
Jesus Christ.
I wouldn't do that to you.

926
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,679
Did I fuckin' turn up to your 21st in a
fuckin' pair of shorts?

927
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,840
Well, look, it wouldn't
worry me, would it?

928
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,039
Look, I'd go home
and get changed,

929
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,880
but it's gonna take me
2 to 2.5 hours.

930
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,440
I've gotta go to Werribee and
dump a load in the truck, so...

931
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,960
Alright, then.

932
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,079
How about I give you a ring
during the week?

933
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,119
I'd prefer if you came back, but
if you've gotta do that, do that.

934
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:32,360
Well, I won't have time.
I'll ring you during the week.

935
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,960
Happy birthday anyway.
Thank you.

936
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,519
Alright. Have a good one.

937
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,440
Thanks, mate. Thank you.

938
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,199
I have very fond memories
of my childhood.

939
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,400
You know, David and I
were brought up on a farm

940
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,119
in sort of northern Victoria.

941
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,599
Mum and Dad were...they were
farmers. They had an orchard.

942
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,000
And that's where I spent
my entire youth, you know.

943
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,000
I'd only ever been to the city...

944
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:18,360
We used to come down
to the city on the fruit runs

945
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,400
when it was time to deliver
all the fruit to the market.

946
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,119
I try and get down here
pretty much every year

947
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,880
for Mum's birthday.

948
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,840
Mum brought me these gloves.
They're beauties.

949
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,159
Little sleeve there with a button
as if they're off a suit.

950
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,400
Good sense of humour,
my mother.

951
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,559
I don't know if David
comes down here much

952
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,880
and I know Dad still finds it
pretty hard,

953
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,000
but I actually like coming up

954
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,280
and, you know,
I don the gloves

955
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,760
and I give
her marble cubbyhouse

956
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,360
a bit of a once over, you know.

957
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,360
Give it a bit of a spruce up.

958
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Good... good fun lady,
my mum,

959
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
and well-liked in the town,
you know.

960
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,039
'Big cake lady', they'd call her.

961
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,039
She wasn't a good cook,
but she made big cakes,

962
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,280
and that was pretty popular
with all me mates.

963
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,119
Very affectionate woman,
my mum.

964
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,599
When you were being
hugged by her,

965
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,079
you knew you were being held

966
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,559
because Mum's shape...
from behind,

967
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,840
she looked like a fridge
with a head, but, you know,

968
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
you knew you were being cared for,
you know,

969
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,639
'cause Dad's emotional bank
account had two cents in it.

970
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,280
So Mum let you know
you were loved

971
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,039
and Dad kept the work going
to keep the money coming in.

972
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,039
And that's the way it was
in those days, you know.

973
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,360
MAN OVER P.A. : Drivers
in the drag-racing category,

974
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,199
could you move to lane six?

975
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,519
It's a pretty strange place,
I suppose,

976
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,440
to have a church at a racetrack.

977
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
They've actually got it here
for the drivers,

978
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,519
somewhere that they can
say a prayer

979
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:52,599
before they go out
to a dangerous race,

980
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,480
which I think is good.

981
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,400
I hope no-one ever gets 
offended by the fact

982
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,199
that I come here
and have something to eat,

983
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,920
but I don't think anyone does.

984
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,760
I mean, I'm just having
a sandwich, you know.

985
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,360
I mean, after all, it is bread -

986
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,559
I'm having my daily bread,
you know.

987
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,280
And I don't think
you need to be religious

988
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,000
to feel the effects of a church,

989
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,519
and that's why I choose
to come and sit here.

990
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,360
You know,
it's a very calming place.

991
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,320
( CAR ENGINES REV LOUDLY )

992
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,159
You know, I think the racing event they
put on here

993
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,159
is sensational.

994
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,920
I mean, there is something here
for everybody.

995
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,559
But wouldn't you know it,

996
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:47,599
you still get the same old pack of
pinheads

997
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,480
that wanna ruin it
for everyone else.

998
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,519
They camp at the southern end
of the racetrack

999
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,480
and they get up to
all sorts of mischief.

1000
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,000
The thing that really gets
my goat about these monkeys

1001
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:04,760
is that we have to, by law,

1002
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,480
supply them
with these toilets, right?

1003
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,440
And every year, without fail,
after the end of the last race,

1004
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,199
they set fire to the bastards.

1005
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,599
What we'll do is
if we can get up there

1006
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,039
15 minutes before
the last race starts, right,

1007
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,519
before the Pitman Challenge,

1008
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,480
and the only way we can get
there, right, is via the racetrack.

1009
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,519
If we drive around
the other side of the track,

1010
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,079
jump over the barrier
and we stand with them,

1011
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:28,400
that'll be enough to deter them
from setting fire to them.

1012
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,880
Can't the cops do that?

1013
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,079
Well, no, they can't. Our job's
to save the toilets, alright?

1014
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,920
Shut up, Pat, they're not worried about
fuckin' toilets.

1015
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,400
What's wrong with you,
you plonker?

1016
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,599
We haven't... Guys,
just focus for a minute, alright?

1017
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,760
There's only
a few more cars to drag,

1018
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,280
so we should
get going now, right?

1019
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,760
You know, if I can just save one
toilet, I'll be happy, I reckon.

1020
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,320
You have got to be joking!

1021
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,800
It's the equaliser, isn't it?

1022
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,440
Oh, Jesus Christ, fellas,
can we just work together?

1023
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,000
Can we just work together
on this one?

1024
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,400
Put the bloody
thumper bar away, mate!

1025
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,800
Shit!
Jesus Christ.

1026
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,400
The fuckin' race has started.

1027
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,880
Look, just pull over.
Hey, shut up.

1028
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,280
Hang on, boys!

1029
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,840
Just hang on!
Shut it!

1030
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,320
For fuck's sake!

1031
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,440
Just keep...

1032
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,840
( TRUCK HORNS BLARE )

1033
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,840
We're here driving
in the middle of a truck race...

1034
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,880
Don't worry about anything!
(Yells indistinctly)

1035
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,599
Just hang on!
Let me concentrate!

1036
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:44,360
Now, shut up, for Christ's sake.

1037
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,000
Are the boys
on the back alright?

1038
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:48,400
Pat, just look at the boys
in the back. Are they alright?

1039
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,880
I don't believe it, Pat.

1040
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,360
You're fuckin' like
a nancy fuckin' ninny!

1041
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,400
Guys, can we just calm down?!
- He is out of control.

1042
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,000
What do you mean
'out of control'?!

1043
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:57,159
You are fuckin' out of control.
- I'm not out of fuckin' control!

1044
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,000
Please, do me a favour...

1045
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:00,639
Oh, Jesus Christ,

1046
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,920
they've already lit
one of the toilets, the bastards!

1047
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,800
Alright, guys,
there's a break, come on!

1048
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Come on. Go, go, go!

1049
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,039
Go to the wall!

1050
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,639
Oh, look at these mongrels.

1051
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,159
What are you doing, Pat?
What are you doing?!

1052
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,840
Sammy, wait for...
Sammy?! Sammy?!

1053
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,199
(Crowd roars)

1054
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,440
Get it up.

1055
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Oi! You spilled my beer,
you bastards!

1056
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,559
Let go of him.

1057
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,280
Oh, Jesus!

1058
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,960
Put it out, Thommo. Put it out.
No, mate, me!

1059
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,320
Leg, leg, leg! Oh, jeez.

1060
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,920
Get it, Thommo.
Put it out. Get it!

1061
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,400
Right, that's enough!

1062
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,320
You've all had
enough fun now, alright?

1063
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,039
(Crowd cheers)
Come on, you've had your fun!

1064
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,519
Get going, you hoons!

1065
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,840
Let's lock 'em all up, boys.
They're unlocked.

1066
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,519
Let's lock 'em up. Alright.

1067
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,000
You right?
Yeah, I'm alright.

1068
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,480
Everyone alright?

1069
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,480

that one, wasn't it?

I mean, that's really put me

1071
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,519
to the end of my test tonight,
I tell you what.

1072
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,000
That's...that's almost
my limit, I reckon.

1073
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:56,199
I mean, no man
should be set on fire

1074

his shitters, you know.

1077
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,360
The problem is
it's Glenn's decision,

1078
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,960
I won't be able to
have you here

1079
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,519
and I'm sorry
it's worked out that way.

1080
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,360
All I did was trot up there to try
and save the fuckin' toilets.

1081
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,880
But you punched the guy out.
He got in the way.

1082
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,360
Sammy, every event we do,

1083
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,280
there's people in between us and the
toilets.

1084
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,760
If you run around
punching people out

1085
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,360
every time you've gotta
get to a toilet,

1086

we'll have to be sponsored
by Don King, mate.

We're plumbers,
you know what I'm saying?

1088
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,119
Well, where was Pat?

1089
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,920
Pat was doing
a backward flip, wasn't he?

1090
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,679
Mate, I know he was
going backwards.

1091
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,519
He's not cut of the same mustard of
you and me, mate.

1092
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,679
And the point is, he's paid
as a plumber, not a title fighter.

1093
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,360
He's a toilet cleaner, mate.

1094
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,400
Mate, the decision's
been made.

1095
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,280
And the reality is that
I've just gotta let you go.

1096
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,000
I need this job big-time,
I'm telling you. I need it.

1097

I'm gonna be evicted
from me house.

I'm gonna have nowhere.

o'clock Monday morning.

just to get you
out of a tight spot

is I can lend you
some money here.

in your skyrocket there.

grab you a coffee

up the top, do you?

it's got me travelling overseas.

1221
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:02,199
In fact, this is my first time
I've ever been on an aeroplane.

1222
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,679
(incredulously) No.
Ever.

1223
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,119
I'm the first person
out of our whole family

1224
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,480
to ever have flown
out of Australia.

1225
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:12,440
And I got a nice little wine here.

1226
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,639
Mind you, like I said, I don't
normally drink white wine.

1227
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,119
That's actually not too...
- Chardonnay.

1228
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:18,000
What do you usually drink?
- Oh, beer.

1229
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:19,480
Oh, well, yeah, yeah.

1230
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:21,960
I drink beer like it's about to
go out of fashion

1231
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,440
and I'm the new trendsetter.

1232
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,079
(Laughs)
So I love it.

1233
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:27,079
I'd bath in it,
if I had my own way.

1234
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:28,559
(Laughs)

1235
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,840
Is it alright if I have
a bit more of that?

1236
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,480
Yeah, absolutely.
- I know it's not beer.

1237
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,000
But I'm getting used to it.

1238
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,920
Now, if I start to wobble
when the plane's actually still...

1239
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,599
INTERCOM:
Ladies and gentlemen,

1240
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,079
as we're about to begin
our descent

1241
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,079
into Los Angeles AirPort,

1242
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,119
would you Please make sure
your tray tables are stowed

1243
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:47,800
and that your safety belts
are fastened.

1244
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,480
I didn't know
it was gonna be this cold.

1245
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,360
This is freezing. Must be about
five degrees or something.

1246
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,559
Oh, thanks. You right?
I can grab that if you want.

1247
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,000
Oh, I'll take it.
- It's got a bit of weight in that.

1248
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:10,960
Watch that. So, are you
a real cowboy, are you, mate?

1249
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,559
I'm afraid not. To tell you
the truth, I'm from New York.

1250
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:17,679
Oh... I'm Kenny, mate, anyway.
(Laughs) - I'm Bobby.

1251
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,360
You're on the wrong side
of the car here.

1252
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,480
So, where are you headed?

1253
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm going to the...
Well, I'm at the poo convention.

1254
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:31,400
Alright.
You know where that is?

1255
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,760
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I do.

1256
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,800
Actually, it's been pretty busy
with these gentlemen.

1257
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,480
There must be an awful lot
of money in crap, huh?

1258
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,480
Yeah, well...

1259
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:41,480
Yeah, well, to be quite honest,
there's a shitload of it.

1260
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:43,000
(Laughs)

1261
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:44,159
You've probably been doing

1262
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,639
some business for us
this morning.

1263
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,280
I can't get over the size
of this place, Bobby.

1264
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:05,280
There aren't many cowboys
in Nashville.

1265
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,480
It's about the music industry.

1266
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,840
There's no ranches, there's
no cattle, there's no sheep.

1267
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,000
(Laughs) Yeah, right.
(Laughs) - You know?

1268
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,639
Look at that city.

1269
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,480
MAN ON RADIO: I got
this notice the other day.

1270
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,840
Now, down at the Nashville
Convention Centre,

1271
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,920
today and for
the next couple of days,

1272
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,039
we've got
the world international

1273
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,440
Pumper and Cleaner Show.

1274
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,920
Now, they've actually
been kind enough

1275
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,400
to send us four tickets,

1276
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,280
and we'll be taking
your calls soon

1277
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,079
and I'm going to give away
these tickets to the People...

1278
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:41,280
Well, mate, Bobby,
I gotta tell you,

1279
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,760
you're a real cowboy
to me, mate.

1280
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,679
Oh, well, thank you, thank you.
- You're the real deal.

1281
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,159
And there's my card too, Bob,

1282
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,480
if ever you need to get a hold
of me for whatever reason.

1283
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:52,679
Alright, enjoy, you know,
the shit-flinging convention.

1284
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,159
(both laugh)

1285
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,280
Thanks, mate. I will.
- Have a good time.

1286
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,760
Look after yourself, Bob.
Alright.

1287
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,360
See youse, mate.
- Have a good night.

1288
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,519
Oh, Jesus.

1289
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,119
You see the snow?

1290
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:23,599
That's...quite pretty.

1291
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,159
Good on 'em.

1292
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,000
( ALARM RINGS )

1293
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:29,000
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1294
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,760
You know, the most
exciting time for me

1295
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,199
when I was a kid growing up

1296
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,119
was once a year,
Dad would take us

1297
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:41,480
to the Royal Melbourne Show
in the city

1298
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:44,559
to see all the tractors
and the animals and whatnot.

1299
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:47,280
I never thought
I'd feel that way again.

1300
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,519
Who was to know
I would end up

1301
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,400
in the land of bloody flags
and anthems

1302
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,079
at a toilet expo, Poo HQ?

1303
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,800
Jesus Christ.

1304
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,880
(Chuckles)

1305
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,679
Oh, yes.

1306
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,960
Oh, yes.

1307
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Look at that girl there.

1308
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:37,360
Now, that would be a dream.

1309
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,800
(Reads) "Working today
for a cleaner tomorrow."

1310
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,800
See, they've even got pride
in their slogans.

1311
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,360
And look, they're driving
a Kenworth.

1312
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,840
I mean, forget the kids.

1313
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,000
If I saw this go on the road,
I'd be impressed.

1314
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:49,119
How you going?
Kenny from Australia.

1315
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,519
Good, Larry.
- You're from Australia?

1316
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:13,199
You seen the name?
It's Ameri-Can.

1317
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,760
Eh?

1318
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,199
So that's all
hydraulically lifted?

1319
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,199
It's all hydraulic.

1320
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,360
When we get ready
to move the trailer,

1321
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,599
we go in and push
a couple of buttons

1322
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:23,079
and that lifts right up.

1323
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:25,480
You could eat
your dinner off that.

1324
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:26,960
(Chuckles) "Scotty's Potties."

1325
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,440
MAN: There's also
John's Johns.

1326
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,119
There's a company in Australia
called "Henry the Turd".

1327
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:33,039
Henry the Turd?
- Henry the Turd.

1328
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,559
Oh, my God.

1329
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,440
Have you been downstairs?

1330
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,920
Downstairs? Oh, still?

1331
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,280
Well, this joint is like
an expo lasagne -

1332
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,800
there's layers and layers.

1333
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,559
I'm serious.
- Oh, yeah?

1334
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:48,800
So it's the same... Well,
I'm going down there now.

1335
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,000
If you want, you can follow me,
it's right underneath us.

1336
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:52,599
Do you wanna follow...?
Yeah, grab your mates.

1337
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:54,480
'Cause I'm walking
down there anyway.

1338
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,880
How are you going, mate?

1339
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,199
Kenny from Australia.
Hey, mate.

1340
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,320
So, what brings you guys here? What
brings you...?

1341
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,039
We're having
the World Expo next year,

1342
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,920
and just looking for
the luxury toilets for that event.

1343
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,440
Oh, OK, like with all the
good taps, all the good basins

1344
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,920
and the televisions,
and all that sort of...

1345
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,400
Televisions?

1346
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,599
Yeah, well, obviously
all the good stuff you want in it.

1347
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:14,480
Whatever you're looking for,
you'll find it here, mate.

1348
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:15,960
They've got everything.
Right.

1349
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,440
That's fantastic.

1350
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,559
It's on wheels.
Fits in a freight elevator.

1351
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,559
You can be taking a...
going to the bathroom,

1352
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:23,440
and the guy can be pissing
in the back.

1353
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,440
Oh, look at this.
You can be taking a piss.

1354
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,360
While watching the other
guy taking a shit.

1355
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,000
(Laughs)
What you doing down there?

1356
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:31,000
You guys have a convention
like this in Australia?

1357
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:32,599
No, mate, we got nothing.
Not like this.

1358
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:34,400
If you're talking about beer,

1359
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,119
there's a convention
every afternoon.

1360
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:37,519
(Man laughs)

1361
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,320
(Mutters) I see, they've got
a spring that goes into the...

1362
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,960
How do they get that
to go in...?

1363
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,679
(Crowd chants) Who?!
WOMAN: Why?

1364
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,159
(Crowd chants) Why?!

1365
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,000
When?!

1366
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:02,599
Why?!

1367
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:04,320
MAN: That was great!

1368
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,920
Wow!

1369
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,960
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
Robin Crow.

01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,320
# Wanting to make
those quantum leaps

1373
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,000
# But I'm not afraid
to jump off that ledge

1374
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:33,000
# I'm not afraid
to dive in deep. #

1375
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:37,960
Thank you.

1376
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,039
( APPLAUSE )

1377
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,480
That was all very impressive,
wasn't it?

1378
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,199
Very...very advanced,
I thought, the information.

1379
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,679
Very futuristic.

1380
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,400
He was talking about
the 'aloominum' pipes,

1381
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,480
at one point.

1382
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:53,960
I spent that long
trying to figure out

1383
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,960
what 'aloominum' was

1384
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,360
that I missed out what the point was of
fixing the pipe,

1385
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,880
but some good information there, I
think.

1386
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,000
I think I'll be able to use some
of that in dealing with people.

1387
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,360
And I got a certificate,

1388
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,000
attendance recognition certificate.

1389
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:08,519
It's not bad, is it?

1390
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,400
Yes, could I be put through
to room 176, please?

1391
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,840
Yeah, Jackie, it's Kenny.

1392
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,920
Yeah, good.

1393
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,440
Yes.

1394
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah, on...on the card?

1395
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,639
Yes. (Chuckles)

1396
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,760
Yourself?

1397
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,840
Oh, fantastic.

1398
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,039
How long for?

1399
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,360
Yeah, love to!

1400
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,199
Yeah, well, I've only just
come into my room

1401
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,960
so I've just gotta
spruce meself up

1402
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,880
with a bit of cut and polish.

1403
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,079
There's a couple of hours
in that!

1404
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:00,519
What's that? On a horse?

1405
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:02,920
Oh, OK. (Chuckles) Yeah.

1406
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Alright, well, I'll see you
in...at the Wildhorse.

1407
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,800
Well, this is definitely it.

1408
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,199
That's the Wildhorse.
I just asked the security bloke.

1409
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,159
This all feels a bit... bit silly.

1410
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,840
I mean, I've got
nothing to wear.

1411
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,679
I didn't know we were
gonna be going out.

1412
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,159
This is a dance club
or something.

1413
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,800
They do linedancing
or something in there.

1414
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,079
And, you know, I...

1415
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:34,079
..I can't help but think
she thinks I'm rich.

1416
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:36,639
You know, she met me
in business class, you know.

1417
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,760
She probably thinks I'm loaded.

1418
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,000
And it was all because I'm
bloody sitting in Glenn's seat.

1419
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:42,760
I'm filling in for him.

1420
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,639
Anyway, I promised
I'd meet her.

1421
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,960
(Man sings) # I got my own problems,
baby

1422
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,840
# Tell somebody else, baby

1423
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,639
# I got my own problems, baby

1424
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,159
# Tell somebody else, baby... #

1425
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,840
Whoops! Here's our chance.

1426
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,320
JACKIE: That's fantastic.

1427
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,079
You know that guy
Randy Travis, the singer?

1428
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:37,559
Yeah, yeah, the country singer, yeah.

1429
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:39,119
He started as
a dishwasher here

1430
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:41,800
and his first pay cheque
is in a frame on that wall.

1431
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,599
Oh, you're kidding!
Nuh.

1432
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:45,559
Isn't that fantastic?
It's amazing.

1433
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:47,119
And Gorbachev, he was here.

1434
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,480
He was a country singer?
- No, he's not a country singer!

1435
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,119
Oh, he's the guy
from Russia. I know.

1436
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:53,000
But all sorts of people,
all sorts of country...

1437
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,440
If you stay here long enough...
- You get to see them.

1438
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,960
It's a different world, isn't it?
It's a different place.

1439
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,159
Look at the size of these ribs!
(Laughs) - It's huge!

1440
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,280
No wonder they know what
they're doing with their toilets.

1441
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,280
Look at the size of that.

1442
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,159
They must give their
toilets a flogging over here.

1443
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,840
That's why they're experts in it.

1444
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,079
I'm sorry - I just realised
I always talk about

1445
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:12,079
working with toilets
and poo and stuff

1446
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:13,920
and it's only because
it's what I do.

1447
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,400
No, that's fine.
- I'm used to it.

1448
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,119
Don't worry.
Don't worry, it's fine.

1449
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:19,000
I mean, I do the same thing,
you know?

1450
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:20,480
What? You don't...

1451
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,960
I do the same thing,
but 30,000 feet up in the air.

1452
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,599
You have to clean the toilets?
Yeah.

1453
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:26,599
Really?
Yeah, absolutely.

1454
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:29,119
This guy in first class
had gone to the bathroom,

1455
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,000
flushed the toilet,

1456
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,280
put the vacuum - I don't know,
for whatever reason -

1457
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,480
reverse cycled.

1458
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:37,639
He came out
covered head to toe.

1459
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,199
Oh, you're kidding.
No.

1460
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,679
( MOBILE PHONE RINGS )
It's alright.

1461
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,639
Hello?

1462
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,559
Oh, hello.

1463
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:48,400
I mean, if you can't control him from the
lounge room,

1464
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,079
how am I supposed to do it
from Nashville, Tennessee?

1465
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,840
Yeah, well...
Well, pop him on the phone.

1466
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,960
G'day, mate.

1467
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,440
It's my boy.

1468
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,000
How you doing?

1469
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:03,440
I'm good, mate. I'm fantastic.

1470
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,000
And a what?

1471
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,320
Yeah, well, you might want
to just hold it there, mate,

1472
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,800
'cause that's a fair bit.

1473
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,840
I don't know
if I'll fit it on the plane.

1474
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,880
We'll have to hire
another plane!

1475
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,400
Yeah, and behave yourself,
will you?

1476
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,000
Don't... Don't upset
your mum too much.

1477
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,920
Alright. Love you, mate.

1478
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,920
That's me ex-wife
that rung me up.

1479
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,480
She's something else.

1480
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:27,400
She is the chief commissioner
and senior sergeant

1481
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,880
of the fun police.

1482
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,119
She's here to outlaw fun altogether.
There's your pad.

1483
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:33,639
Thanks for that.
- Thank you.

1484
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,320
Every time, every time
without fail

1485
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,639
that I'm having a good time,
or I'm enjoying myself,

1486
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,920
or I'm not at work
and I'm just calming down,

1487
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,480
or like I'm here, she rings.

1488
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:44,920
Well, glad you're having
a good time.

1489
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,519
I am having a good time.
- Yeah.

1490
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:48,599
Don't say that out loud
'cause she'll ring again.

1491
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:51,039
(Laughs)
She knows.

1492
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,480
Now, I've got a small confession to
make.

1493
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:54,480
Oh, really?

1494
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:56,840
Yeah, a bit of an apology
or a confession.

1495
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,280
I'd never been on an aeroplane
or seen the toilets on them

1496
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,320
so I wanted to know
how it worked.

1497
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,440
So I pulled the lid
off the back of it

1498
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,440
and I left one of the clips off.

1499
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,440
Are you serious?

1500
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,440
And I didn't put
the thing back on.

1501
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,920
(Laughs)
So, sorry.

1502
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,400
It's working now, isn't it?

1503
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,000
I got it fixed, didn't I?
- Yeah, it's fine, it's fine.

1504
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,760
Anyway, let's not...
- Oh, God.

1505
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,840
It works now. You should eat.
- Yeah, I will.

1506
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,320
Before your meal gets warm,

1507
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,800
and I should
before mine gets cold.

1508
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,280
Look at the size of this thing.

1509
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,400
No wonder there's no longer
dinosaurs on the earth.

1510
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,920
They've killed the last one.
Here it is on me plate!

1511
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:34,400
There you go, Jackie.
Watch the gutter there.

1512
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,199
Watch your step. You right?
- Oh, thanks, Kenny.

1513
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,679
Just watch it there, Jackie.
- Thank you.

1514
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,360
Don't slip over. I'd hate that.
- Ooh!

1515
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,880
Alright, well,
I'll see you later, then.

1516
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,599
Oh, thanks. Hey, listen, do you
want a lift? It's pouring rain.

1517
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:45,679
No, it's fine, I'm only just...
- I'll take you somewhere.

1518
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,519
No, I'm only a couple of blocks
from here.

1519
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:48,519
I don't mind walking.

1520
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,280
Are you sure?
- Yeah, I love the rain.

1521
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,000
I honestly do.
- You're crazy.

1522
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:53,960
(Laughs) I'll see you later.
- Hey, listen.

1523
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,440
You know, I've got
tomorrow off

1524
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,679
so maybe I could help you
shop for your son.

1525
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,360
Yeah.
- I could show you Nashville.

1526
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,119
Alright, well,
I've got a deal for you.

1527
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:02,599
You show me round Nashville

1528
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:04,079
and I'll show you
round the expo

1529
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:05,920
so you can see
what I do for a job.

1530
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,519
OK, that's a good deal.
- Wanna do that?

1531
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,000
I'd love to.
- Oh, that'd be great.

1532
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:11,519
Well, we'll meet, say,
9:30 at the front, yeah?

1533
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,039
Yep, 9:30 at the front.
- Alright.

1534
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,519
OK.
- That's perfect.

1535
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,960
Put your belt on. You'll get
yourself in trouble. You right?

1536
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,280
She's a nice girl, isn't she?

1537
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:24,960
Looks like I'm gonna have
half a day off!

1538
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,840
Which would be good.

1539
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,599
Good on her.

1540
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:31,800
(Laughs incredulously)

1541
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,480
Good on her.

1542
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,199
You know, it must be
very difficult for Jackie

1543
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,000
to do a job like she does,

1544
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:59,039
you know,
flying around in the air

1545
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,800
in a tube full of strangers,

1546
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,400
lob in countries
with people you don't know.

1547
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,760
You know, it sounds very glamorous
but I'm sure it's not.

1548
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,559
You know, and even I've found
since I've been over here

1549
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:11,519
that you see things that
make about as much sense

1550
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,840
as a nun at a rock concert,
you know.

1551
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,560
And sometimes you just want to turn to
someone from home

1552
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,680
and say, "Did you understand
what he's talking about?"

1553
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,119
I mean, has someone
rung the Queen

1554
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,439
and let her know what they're doing
with her language?

1555
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,640
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

1556
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,680
put your hands together
for the next bullfighter!

1557
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,880
This is the way we do it
in Nashville, Tennessee...

1558
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,119
There you go.
- Ooh. Look at this guy.

1559
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:53,000
..show up, drink shots
and have fun.

1560
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,840
Hey.

1561
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,680
I reckon I know
who that guy is.

1562
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,800
Serious. I met him yesterday.

1563
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,159
Like, he's not a mate.

1564
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,640
I met him.
He's a Japanese businessman.

1565
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,319
MAN: Go, boy! Hee-hoo!

1566
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:11,319
You would not get me
on that thing

1567
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:12,840
for all the money in China.

1568
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,319
Or Japan.

1569
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,920
MAN: 20! Whoa! Whoa, there!

1570
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,359
(Laughs)

1571
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,000
Mate, you looked fantastic in there. That
was a pretty big fall.

1572
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:29,520
You looked like
the bloody Sushi Cowboy

1573
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,680
up there on the bull.

1574
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,119
(Laughs) Sushi Cowboy.
- Sushi Cowboy.

1575
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:34,800
It's not that great, man.

1576
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,439
Where's all your mates?
Where's all your buddies?

1577
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,000
Oh, they're at Hooters,
you know, with the big, big...

1578
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:40,800
Oh, hello. Bing bong.
Yes.

1579
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,000
But you guys go ahead, so...

1580
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,840
I go back to the hotel.

1581
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,800
Oh, there's no need for you
to go back to the hotel, mate.

1582
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,640
Don't let a bloody sore leg and
a bad back stand in the way

1583
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,720
of a good night.

1584
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,119
You can stay with us, if
you want. We've got no plans.

1585
01:09:54,199 --> 01:09:56,239
What do you want to do?

1586
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,000
MAN: Give it up for
the Sushi Cowboy!

1587
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:02,399
(Sings) # I...

1588
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,319
# Once was lost... #

1589
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,800
# I'm found

1590
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,119
# I once was blind

1591
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:18,239
# But now I see... #

1592
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:21,159
( CHEERING )

1593
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:23,640
Hello, Nashville!
MAN: Sushi Cowboy!

1594
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,680
( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE )

1595
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,239
He's had a pretty big night,
hasn't he?

1596
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:33,239
He sure has.
His bull-riding days are over.

1597
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:34,800
(Laughs)

1598
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:41,720
What time do you fly out tomorrow?

1599
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,720
3:30.

1600
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,039
Oh, OK, so pretty early.
Yeah.

1601
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:46,840
Sorry, I'll get your lift.

1602
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,439
Well, thanks
for inviting me out tonight.

1603
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,000
I had a ball, Jackie, I real...

1604
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:51,439
Did you?
- I honestly did. I did.

1605
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,319
Oh, good. I'm glad you came.
It was fun.

1606
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:55,800
Yeah, so am I. Here's your lift.
- Oh, thanks.

1607
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,680
Well, um, do you want to
go up to the bar?

1608
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,119
I...
A drink or something?

1609
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:02,560
I'd love to, Jackie,
but I really should...

1610
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,640
I mean, the bar's open
for another hour.

1611
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,279
Yeah, I would,
but the meter's running

1612
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:09,359
and I better get the Sushi Cowboy back
home safe.

1613
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,520
He's off with the fairies, so...
- OK.

1614
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,880
But, look, tomorrow,
if you're free tomorrow,

1615
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,760
I'd love to see you
before you go.

1616
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,119
That would be great.

1617
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,640
Have a coffee
at the bar at midday?

1618
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,640
I'd love that.

1619
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,439
That'd be really fun.
- Well, I'll come back tomorrow.

1620
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,319
OK.
Yeah? Just watch out.

1621
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:26,399
That lift is gonna snap you like
a twig if it closes on your chest.

1622
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,399
OK.

1623
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,680
You're right to get
to your room?

1624
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,119
Yeah.
- Alright.

1625
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:32,000
Well, thanks for a good night.
I had fun.

1626
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:33,600
OK. 'Night.
- Alright. Take care, Jackie.

1627
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,079
'Bye, Kenny.
- See you. 'Bye.

1628
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,079
(Both laugh)

1629
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:48,279
Yeah, mate, that goes into
Ned Kelly's helmet there.

1630
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:50,039
Right.
- Oh. Right, I see.

1631
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:51,880
There you go. You're in now.
Good.

1632
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,920
Thanks for a great night, mate.
- Thank you very much.

1633
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,680
I'm really sorry
to mess up the night.

1634
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,960
No, you didn't mess it up.
- You and your lady.

1635
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,319
I'm sorry.
- No, it's all good.

1636
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:00,720
But I had a good time.

1637
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,520
Thank you.
- Me too. See you at the expo.

1638
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,319
Maybe tomorrow morning... (Coughs)

1639
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:06,920
..tomorrow morning
you could show me

1640
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,039
where the TV toilets are.

1641
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:10,920
Oh, I don't know
if they've got any here.

1642
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:13,640
Well, I mentioned them
because we make them.

1643
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,439
You make them?
- Yeah.

1644
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,199
Oh, really?
- Fair dinkum.

1645
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,920
Yeah, Glenn, it's me.

1646
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,000
Yeah, look, I've gotta be quick.

1647
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,159
I'm in a meeting with
some Japanese gentlemen

1648
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,600
that I've met here at the expo

1649
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,520
and what they wanted to do
is get a quote

1650
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,520
on buying some of our
20-foot combo units,

1651
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,720
the VIP 20-foot blocks
with the televisions in them.

1652
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,840
But they want a price on them
really quickly

1653
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,520
to buy about six or seven units,

1654
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,399
as in the full blocks.

1655
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,079
Yep. Hang on a sec, Glenn.

1656
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:50,600
67.
- What?

1657
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,840
It's not "six or seven",
it's sixty-seven.

1658
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,520
Sixty-sev... You're shitting me,
aren't you?

1659
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,159
No, serious. - 67...
- 67 full 20-foot blocks?

1660
01:12:58,239 --> 01:12:59,319
Units.
Units.

1661
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:00,880
They want 67 of them.

1662
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,520
No, he's as serious
as a heart attack.

1663
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,119
No, I'm here with him now.

1664
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,159
Also, we'd like to get a price.
- A price.

1665
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:09,439
In one hour.
- One hour. In an hour.

1666
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,960
No, he's fair dinkum.

1667
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,199
Yeah, 67 units, but we need
the price in an hour.

1668
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:16,359
And Mr Sato is coming.
- Yeah, I know.

1669
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:18,640
I know I called him, you know,
a freaked-out bastard,

1670
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,000
but he's a bastard
to me only, not to you.

1671
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:23,239
Right.

1672
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:24,760
See? So just
speak to him directly.

1673
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,439
Right, talk to him.
- Into his eyes.

1674
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,000
OK.
- You talk to him.

1675
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:30,840
And I will translate because
he doesn't speak any English.

1676
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,640
He doesn't speak any English?
- No, no, no.

1677
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,119
So just speak to him
and I'll translate.

1678
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:36,840
Oh, you'll translate.
I know what you're saying.

1679
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,279
Be yourself.
- Yeah, I will.

1680
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:40,159
( MOBILE PHONE RINGS )
Hang on a tick.

1681
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:41,680
Answer this.
- Yeah, I will, yeah.

1682
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,720
This could be Glenn now.
- Oh, yeah, check the price.

1683
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah, I will, absolutely.
Hello? Glenn?

1684
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:47,079
Sorry, Takashi.

1685
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:48,600
I can't hear you, mate.
Speak up.

1686
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,680
Oh, g'day, mate. Yeah, good.

1687
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,279
Look, Dave,
I can't talk now, mate.

1688
01:13:52,359 --> 01:13:56,640
I'm in the mid... Yeah, hang on,
I'm in the middle of a... Yep.

1689
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,119
When did that happen?

1690
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,279
Yeah.

1691
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:03,640
Well, is he...? Are you
with him now? Is he alright?

1692
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:07,560
Right.

1693
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,399
Well, what do the doctors say?
What do...?

1694
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,399
Well, yeah, hang on, don't...

1695
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:15,520
Well, can you ring me
straight back

1696
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,760
when you've spoken
to the doctors?

1697
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,039
Yeah. Alright, yeah,
but ring me back so I... Yeah.

1698
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,119
Everything's alright. Take care of your
dad, you know.

1699
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,640
Yeah.
- I'll speak with Glenn.

1700
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,520
Yeah, you can speak to him?
- Oh, yeah.

1701
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,800
I'm so sorry, mate.
- That's... That's alright.

1702
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,239
Alright, mate, well,
I'll speak to you

1703
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:37,520
when I get back to Australia.

1704
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,640
Right.
- Alright, thank you.

1705
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,800
See you, mate.

1706
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,640
Better get my belt on. See you!

1707
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,960
Just to the airport, mate.

1708
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
The international.

1709
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:53,520
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be
meeting her at the bar.

1710
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,000
Well, she's an airline steward

1711
01:14:55,079 --> 01:14:57,159
so she'll be dressed
in a uniform.

1712
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:00,520
Well... Yeah, well, I actually don't know
her surname.

1713
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,359
My father's very ill, so l...
Actually, don't tell her that,

1714
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:06,880
Just tell her I'm really,
really sorry that I can't make it.

1715
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,039
MAN: He's stable.
His obs are looking good.

1716
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:22,760
The doctor should be in to talk
to you in a bit, but he's, um...

1717
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,199
See, he's medicated
at the moment

1718
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:26,159
and obviously exhausted

1719
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,680
but he's not in any pain.

1720
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,439
He's on a list for an operation
on Tuesday morning.

1721
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,319
OK.
- So you can come back in...

1722
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:33,359
When I rang the hospital

1723
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:35,199
they said it was
a bleeding ulcer or something.

1724
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:36,720
And so that's all it is?

1725
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,000
If you're gonna talk about me,
at least talk to me.

1726
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:42,039
I'm awake.
I'm not bloody dead, you know.

1727
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:44,319
How are you, mate?
- Oh, how do you reckon I am?

1728
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:46,920
Stuck in this shithole.

1729
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,359
Where...?
Where have you been?

1730
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:51,119
I got here as soon as I could.

1731
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,439
I've come straight
from the airport.

1732
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,159
Am I in your way here?
- No.

1733
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:58,159
Ah. I mean, 70 years of age,
and wouldn't you know,

1734
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:02,119
these pretty little things
like this girl here walking round

1735
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:04,399
and I've been saddled
with Daisy here.

1736
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,720
Bloody tailgater.

1737
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,159
He's a nurse, Dad.

1738
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,880
You haven't used your pan.
- I don't intend to use it, either.

1739
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,720
There's no way known
I'm gonna use that.

1740
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,600
You can shove it up your own arse. I'm
not putting it up mine.

1741
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,039
Before you get
discharged tomorrow,

1742
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:18,159
before your operation,

1743
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,720
we need a stool to test
whether or not there's blood.

1744
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,560
I'll give you one.
I'll give you a sample.

1745
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,680
I'll give you one there

1746
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,119
that Jack O'Toole
wouldn't chop through,

1747
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,840
but I'm not doing it in that.

1748
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,199
It's really quite simple.
See this?

1749
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:30,800
Might be simple for you.
- See that?

1750
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,000
It'd be like trying to put
marshmallow into a moneybox.

1751
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:35,199
Now, I'm not gonna use it.
I'm telling you, son!

1752
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:38,239
Alright, well, is it... is he OK
to go to the toilet if I take him?

1753
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:39,800
Uh, if he would rather do that,

1754
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,239
then, yeah, sure,
I can organise that.

1755
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:43,159
But it's...
I need the stool in this tray.

1756
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:45,399
OK. Alright.
I'll be back in a bit.

1757
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,920
Nightmare, this.
- Yeah, well, it's not...

1758
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,560
Don't be having a go at him.
He's the one looking after you.

1759
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,920
Yeah, he's the one.
I'd rather HER look after me.

1760
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,079
Yeah, well, it doesn't...
Look at her. Jesus Christ!

1761
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,079
He wants me to bend over
in front of him.

1762
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,079
Have you seen him?

1763
01:16:57,159 --> 01:16:59,399
It's not that he wants to see
your backside or something.

1764
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,279
They need to get your stool sample,
your poo sample.

1765
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:05,359
Christ Almighty,
I'm too old for this shit.

1766
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:07,399
Bloody whinge.
That's all I get all day.

1767
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,920
Whinge, whinge, whinge.
- Yeah.

1768
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,079
Oh, get back on your camel.

1769
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,840
Is that that bloody bastard
going again over there?

1770
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,000
(Groans)
Must have disorder, mate.

1771
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:19,199
Alright, you br... ba... bananas

1772
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:21,119
or whatever you're
bloody talking about.

1773
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,800
Dad. Dad.
- What?

1774
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,000
This is not the place for it, Dad.
It's a hospital.

1775
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:26,880
Now, keep your voice down.
They're sick too, alright?

1776
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,079
Keep my voice down.
- Yeah, well, don't...

1777
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:31,359
Supposed to be a bloody farmer. He's
got about 17 kids.

1778
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,119
He hasn't had too much time picking
tomatoes,

1779
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,439
I can tell you that.

1780
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,399
Dad, they're sick too, so have
a bit of respect, alright?

1781
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,000
Yeah, alright.
- Just a bit of respect.

1782
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:41,000
Get all the nurses
and we'll move all this.

1783
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,880
Bloody tubes up me nose
and up me arse.

1784
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,279
Now they want bloody stools.

1785
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:53,039
A man hasn't had
anything to eat.

1786
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:55,640
I'm as thin as a bloody rake.

1787
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,199
You can smell the shit
through me ribs.

1788
01:17:57,279 --> 01:17:59,239
They should take
a sample there.

1789
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,039
Nurse, that's the sample
for Mr Smyth.

1790
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:06,000
Right. Great, thanks.
Alright, thanks.

1791
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,000
You can't get this
medication for him.

1792
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:10,159
He's got to get it himself.

1793
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,159
He's gotta get it himself? OK.
- Yeah, it's very important.

1794
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,279
That's not... not today.
I want to go today.

1795
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:16,039
No tomorrow.
Forget tomorrow. Today!

1796
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:18,720
No, we've gotta leave you here
on all the gear for the night

1797
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,159
to keep a monitor on you,

1798
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:21,800
and then the operation
is next week.

1799
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,520
The operation is next week?
What operation?

1800
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,079
They've got you on
a schedule next week.

1801
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:26,600
The operation on
your bloody stomach!

1802
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,600
No operation.

1803
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,800
I'm not having an operation,
especially not in here.

1804
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,560
You only hear about
the success rate, son,

1805
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,000
you don't hear
about their failures,

1806
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:35,279
about people getting crook
a week after an operation,

1807
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:36,920
them opening them up
when it's too late

1808
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,359
and they've got
a bloody cutlery set

1809
01:18:38,439 --> 01:18:39,600
or scissors inside them

1810
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,680
that are left inside them
by people that are incompetent.

1811
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,319
Dad, you've gotta have
the operation.

1812
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:44,840
If you don't have the operation,

1813
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,079
there really will be
some trouble.

1814
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,600
Dad, you have to have
the operation.

1815
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:48,920
You can't say no to that.

1816
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Oh, we'll worry about that
when it's supposed to happen,

1817
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:53,000
but today,
I'm going out today, son.

1818
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:55,119
No, well, Dad,
you can't go out today,

1819
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,000
but, look, you've only got
one more night here

1820
01:18:57,079 --> 01:18:58,880
and, uh...and
we'll get you out of here

1821
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,920
and I'll come back tomorrow
and I'll pick you up...

1822
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Wait on, wait on,
where are you going, boy?

Don't... You're not going.

place or your place

and ring him now.

sort out

before I shuffle off.

1830

I'm telling you now. But don't
you leave me in here to rot.

1831
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,439
Alright, Dad.
- Leave me in a place like this.

1832
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,720
You may as well leave me
in the bloody morgue.

1833

They'll carry me
out of here feet first

Alright.

Wouldn't do that to a dog,
let alone your father.

I'll go and ring him now.
- Go and ring him now.

1838

I'll be back.
- You make sure you come back.

1839

Make sure of it.
- I will, Dad.

1840
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,399
Don't leave me here.
- I won't. I'll be back.

This is bloody ridiculous.

instead of this bloody thing.

Well, Dad, the toilet
wasn't gonna fit in my car,

1845

and it sure as hell wasn't
gonna fit in Dave's Mercedes.

I was only thinking of you.

1847
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:06,239
I brought the truck so
I could bring you a real toilet,

1848
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:08,840
so you didn't have to dig a hole
to have a shit.

no sense whatsoever.

an idea like this,

give me a bit of notice
so I can slash me wrists.

until he actually is dying?

Or until he's dead
and can't do this?

has different effects
on different people.

about something.
