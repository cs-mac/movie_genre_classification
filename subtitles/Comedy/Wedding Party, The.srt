1
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,880
Well, Michelle, we did it.
Happy graduation.

2
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,560
You know,
living at my parents' house,

3
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,560
th-that's, um...
that's a temporary thing.

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,240
Uh, we've been going out
for, what, three years.

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,840
You're not, like, getting bored
with things, are you?

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,200
Michelle, I... I'm gonna ask you something
that I've never asked you before.

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,400
Is it kinky?
I don't think so. No.

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,240
You don't have to be embarrassed if you want
to add more spiciness to our relationship.

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Actually, um,

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,280
maybe you could just, uh,
you know,

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
use your napkin.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,040
My napkin?
Mr. Levenstein.

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,520
Yes.
You have a phone call.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,200
Excuse me.
Thank you.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,840
- Hello. - Jim, it's Dad.
Uh, you left the ring at home.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,760
The box is empty.
But-But I'm on my way,

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
and I've got the...

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,400
I've got the ring, so
don't panic, son. Okay?

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,280
Bye-bye.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,920
Who was that?

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,640
Uh, that was my dad.

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,560
That was, uh, my dad. That was, uh...
He couldn't get through on...

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,600
I didn't answer my cell.
So he was, uh,

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,600
getting all, uh...
was getting all worried.

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,560
You know how he is. But everything is,
uh... everything is okay now.

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,640
Everything is, uh...
Everything is perfectly fine.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,200
I think I know what you're gonna
ask me.

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,360
And it's okay.
L... I don't have to use my napkin.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,240
- Wha...
- I've got my own techniques.

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
Michelle, where... where are you going?

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,840
Michelle? Hey. Hey.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,800
Okay.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Okay, Michelle. Michelle.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Michelle.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
Psst!

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,960
Michelle, I think you need to stop.
Okay, keep going.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,040
Oh, my God.
Michelle. Michelle.

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,200
Michelle! Oh, my God.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Oh, my God. Okay.

40
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,040
Well, I made it. Where's Michelle?
The washroom?

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,720
You know, I was so nervous she was
gonna spot me. Here's the ring, son.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
Ohh.
Let me tell you something.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,720
This is some ring.
Look at the rock on this baby.

44
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,640
Mr. Big Spender. Hope you didn't
blow your wad on this, son.

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,120
Not yet.
Your mother and I...

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,680
could not be more
thrilled for you, Jim.

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,360
I mean, we're so happy. And I know
you're excited. I can see it in your face.

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,240
- I mean, you look like you're ready to burst.
- Uh-huh.

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,200
I mean, your cheeks, they're flush.
I wish your mother could be here.

50
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,640
Not me. That's what I wish.
You know, this is...

51
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
this is one of those moments, Jim,

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,640
that you're gonna remember
for the rest of your life.

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,880
- Yes, it is.
- You bet it is.

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,120
You bet it is.

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,320
I cannot believe my son
is gonna pop the question.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,360
- What was that?

57
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
Th-That?

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,560
That? Knockin' on wood.

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,000
And what is this, uh, popping...
popping what? What question?

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
You are...
Oh, you're a wreck. What...

61
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,400
You need some air.
You need some air.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,480
- Walk me to my car.
- No, I'm not walking you...

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,280
- Listen to me.
This is for your own good.

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
Oh!

65
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Your penis!

66
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,880
Watch your penis.
I got it.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,880
Your pants.
I got the pants!

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
I got the pants!
Please!

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,960
Everybody, please.
Everybody just calm down here.

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,240
Everybody, just quiet!
Lower your voice.

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,000
It's disgusting!

72
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,680
Now,

73
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,400
I came here to do something...

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,120
And, damn it, I'm...
I'm gonna do it.

75
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,480
Michelle.

76
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,840
Hello, dear.

77
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,120
Michelle Anabeth Flaherty,

78
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,520
I love you...

79
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,840
more than I could...

80
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,520
ever explain at this particular moment.

81
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,960
Dad. The ring.

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,360
Oh.

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,400
Will you marry me?
Yes.

84
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,200
My son.

85
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm the happiest man in the world.

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,880
We should all be so happy.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
Cheers, gentlemen, sweetheart.

88
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,640
I'm impressed.

89
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,320
Marriage is a binding,

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,360
unifying, eternal,

91
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,600
never-ending, permanent...

92
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,440
chaining together
of two people.

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Jim, have you thought this through?

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,440
Yes. Yes, Finch.
Thank you.

95
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,960
I had actually been trying to figure it
out for a while.

96
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,680
You know, when is the right time?
Is there a right time?

97
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,080
And finally I realized, duh, you love
the girl, marry her.

98
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,760
Aw.

99
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,240
Oh! Let's dance.
Dance?

100
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
No.
No, you have to learn sometime.

101
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
Come on!

102
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,120
Don't laugh at me.

103
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,160
Okay, okay.

104
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,280
I'm just glad that's not me.

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,440
Finch, you don't think there's one girl you're
destined to spend your entire life with?

106
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,560
They're all for me, Kevin.

107
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,120
Not, uh... Not so bad, huh?
All right.

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,800
Do this.

109
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,240
Well, the wedding should be
rather entertaining.

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,760
Bro, that's it?

112
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,800
There's no keg anywhere.

113
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,520
Jim.
Hey, John.

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,720
The food and the drink
are really bad.

115
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,640
"F" for presentation.

116
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,400
The good news for you...
What's that?

117
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,840
We're gonna be
ushers at the wedding.

118
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,400
This is amazing.

119
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,040
I don't recognize half the people in
this place.

120
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,000
At least they all brought gifts.

121
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,600
Hello.
Hello. I'm Mary Flaherty.

122
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,880
Oh, hello.
Harold Flaherty.

123
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,680
Please, please come in.
Lovely to meet you.

124
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,320
We've been expecting you.
How was your trip?

125
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,640
- Delightful.
- Who's excited about the wedding?

126
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,920
Anxious might be more accurate.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,840
Oh, w-w-we've never met your son.

128
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,760
You'll get to meet him.

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,720
Rudy and Sam would like to meet him too.
Oh, yes.

130
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,920
Better bring them in from the car.
They've been cooped up.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,880
Oh, for heaven sakes.
You brought your sons?

132
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
Our dogs.
We never travel without them.

133
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,160
Oh, my goodness.
Well, honey,

134
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,880
why don't you go get those critters out of
the car and we'll start on some cocktails?

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,880
Ah, thank you.
Right. I'll, uh, get the dogs.

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,880
There's one thing that'll
make this wedding perfect.

137
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,840
No Stifler.

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,280
Well, that's one dick
we are not inviting.

139
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,880
- Motion seconded.
- Motion carried.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,360
So, Finch, what are you gonna do
with that fancy NYU diploma?

141
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,080
I'll frame it.
Then I'll write my memoirs.

142
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,640
Well, you should come to law school, man.
You know I could use the company.

143
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,800
Kids, Michelle's parents are here.
Come on. We're waiting.

144
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,140
Oh, crumbs on the shirt.
That's bad. Okay. That's fine.

145
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,800
I'll change. I'll change.

146
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,640
Fuckers.

147
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,480
Well, polish my nuts and
serve me a milk shake.

148
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,820
Oh, cake, huh?
Hope it's good.

149
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,620
Hi. How are you?
Congratulations.

150
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:19,980
Hey.

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,860
Congratulation, jism.

152
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,900
Excuse me. Stifler.

153
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,780
Hey, Jim.
Stifler.

154
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,020
- What are you doing here?
- Happy fuck day, ass mouth.

155
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,180
Put the cake down.
Check it out. I made it myself.

156
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,700
That's very cute. What happened to my
invite? Got lost in the mail, fuckface?

157
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,020
I don't want to discuss this. Quiet!
Oh, quiet yourself.

158
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,980
I think I can spell...
Seriously, man. Seriously...

159
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,100
Jesus! Damn it, Stifler.

160
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,340
Jim, look what you did.
Look what I did?

161
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,980
Look at this shit.
What am I supposed to do now?

162
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,740
Are you happy now, man?
Why are you here?

163
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,660
My dick looks like a corn dog.
I got cake all over my balls.

164
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,220
Jim, honey.
Shit.

165
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,100
The Flaherty’s are waiting.
You think he's upstairs, honey?

166
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,900
Oh, you're fucked now, Jim.

167
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,700
Stifler, get up.

168
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,620
This dog's great!
Is it weird that it feels good?

169
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,900
All right.

170
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,540
What about the dining room?
I know you'll just love him.

171
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,460
- Jesus, Stifler.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

172
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,860
Stop enjoying it so much.
- Lick it off!

173
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,100
Whoo-hoo-hoo.!

174
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,660
Son of a... You little shit.

175
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,500
- You gotta take your pants off, man.

176
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,900
- Jim.
- No, it's not what it looks like.

177
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,540
- What are you doing, son? Jim.
- My dogs!

178
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,740
Don't go in there. Lord knows what
they'll do to you. I love this dog!

179
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,620
- I-I-I was just trying to get him off, Dad.
- That is your son?

180
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,540
Back away from the animal.

181
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,100
Hey, great party.
Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Flaherty, I presume.

182
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,580
Hey, where are you going?

183
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,220
Well, uh, lunch is, uh, served.

184
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,980
I... I really hope that, uh...
that-that we can just...

185
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,940
that we can all just forget about
this and-and-and move on...

186
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,660
and start again...
start again fresh.

187
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,020
Jim, if you hope to be the provider and
protector for our firstborn daughter,

188
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,940
you have a long way to go.

189
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,820
Thank you, sir.

190
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,060
They think you're an angel...

191
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,420
and-and I'm...
I'm just some ungrateful dog-rapist.

192
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,900
They just think they raised
a proper, little band girl.

193
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,020
And-And besides, sometimes it's...
it's nice to be a little more traditional.

194
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,860
How so? How-How do you mean traditional?
I'm thinking about the wedding.

195
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,620
Well, it's just this one day.

196
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,140
One day where-where everyone's
eyes are on me for a change.

197
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,620
I've just never walked into a room
and...

198
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,620
and had everyone go,
"Ooh," and, "Ahh,"

199
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,140
and, "Isn't she elegant?"

200
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,940
That is exactly how our wedding is
going to be.

201
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,820
I promise.

202
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,660
Shit, I've got a frosted ass crack.
Hey, Finch,

203
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,740
you want this for here
or to go?

204
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,780
"A witty saying proves nothing. "
Voltaire.

205
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,860
"Suck my dick. "
Ron Jeremy.

206
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,080
Oh, boys.
Anybody seen the bride's parents?

207
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,500
No? Hmm.

208
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,420
Wait a second.

209
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,180
Wait a second.
Come on, Stifler.

210
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,100
This isn't a graduation party.
Time to go.

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,620
Wait. Hold on.
Jim's getting married, isn't he?

212
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,900
Holy fuckin' shit!
This is major!

213
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,260
Do you have the slightest idea of how important
this is? We get to have a bachelor party.

214
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,300
Yes! We celebrate the death of Jim
with a party in his honor.

215
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,320
Buck up, fellas.
Show some enthusiasm.

216
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,160
It's gonna be fuckin' great.
Oh, my God!

217
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,960
Finch, he-he does make
a good point.

218
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,960
Yeah, he does.

219
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,200
You never heard me say that.

220
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,080
I do not deserve
a girl this cool.

221
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,440
Michelle said the wedding
was doable, right?

222
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,560
A wedding.
A wedding, yeah.

223
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,080
You know, I promised her her wedding...
you know, the wedding of her dreams.

224
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,800
Okay.
What's the problem?

225
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,120
Dancing. Uh, she wants...
she's gonna want to dance.

226
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,080
You know, there's that whole tradition:
The first dance at the reception.

227
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
She's gonna wanna dance
Fred Astaire kind of shit.

228
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,920
I can't do that. I can't... She learned
all that from band camp.

229
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,680
Okay, so you take lessons,
you know, right away.

230
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,000
Lessons. Okay. I have to convince her
parents that I'm not a shithead.

231
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,320
Challenging.
Indeed, challenging.

232
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
But doable.
What else?

233
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,320
What else?
I don't know what else.

234
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,680
That's the thing.
She cares too much to tell me.

235
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,360
She doesn't want me to worry
that she might be worried.

236
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,280
So I'm worried.

237
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,600
Recon.

238
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,520
You mean, like-like spying on, uh...
like spying on Michelle?

239
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,880
Spying is deceitful.

240
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,440
Extra attention
means you're concerned.

241
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,800
This is... This is true. This is good.
Guys, here's to the next step.

242
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,680
Would you please shut up with that
stepping? Put your glass down.

243
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,600
We'll find a wonderful place somewhere.
I promise. We'll keep looking.

244
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,440
Is everything okay in here?
The study can get a little chilly.

245
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,600
Do you have enough blankets?
We're fine. Thank you.

246
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,320
I... I was kind of hoping that, uh...

247
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,000
that someday soon
we could have a little talk.

248
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,800
I'd really like to tell you why I think I'll
make a good husband.

249
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,920
Whenever you get a chance.

250
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,040
- Oh, why is that?
Come on.

251
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,040
See, I was saying that soon...
we could talk.

252
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,400
This... This right now is-is sort of
the preliminary talk...

253
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,800
before the future... longer talk,

254
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,360
which would be like a...
a quiet, uh, private dinner talk.

255
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,760
Let him finish.

256
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm talking to you.

257
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,440
Shh.
- Okay.

258
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,880
Good talking to you.

259
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,080
No. No, these aren't
gonna work.

260
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,200
Wow.

261
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,520
You guys in a sporting goods store.
Very good.

262
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,640
Hey, Finch,
I think they got your size.

263
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,560
Aw, beautiful.

264
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,720
Jim needs to learn
to dance for his wedding.

265
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,200
You know, I think he's screwed.

266
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,000
Of course he's screwed.
He's getting married.

267
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,920
I can't wait to see this disaster.

268
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,640
What makes you think
you're invited?

269
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,040
I already called up Jim's mom,
got the info.

270
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,960
I'm preparing
for the festivities.

271
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,000
It's time for me to boom-boom with
the bridesmaids, Finch-fucker.

272
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,880
'Cause I'm gonna hang out
with my wang out.

273
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,440
And I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out!

274
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,840
Ooh, yep, that's
what I'm talking about.

275
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,120
All right, Stifler. Um,

276
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,520
this-this is a little, uh,
difficult to explain.

277
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,320
Look, you're... you're okay.

278
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,120
You're okay.
I... I... I mean, uh... I mean, I like you.

279
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, great.
You can blow me after practice.

280
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
I'm working, dude.
Well, dude...

281
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,760
- Come on. Work it! Hustle!

282
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,080
See, my mom didn't know that there
was a misunderstanding. Push it! Move it!

283
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,640
- You're not invited!
- Hold!

284
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,600
Dude, how the hell do you even
think you're getting married?

285
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,960
I've been looking out for your sex
life since high school. You what?

286
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,720
Ohhhh! Ohh!

287
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,960
The first tits
this guy ever saw...

288
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,760
were because of me.

289
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,280
The first girl he ever hooked up with...

290
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,760
was at my party at my cottage.

291
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,240
That girl is the girl he's marrying.

292
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,840
The Stif-man showed him the way.

293
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,160
- Can I get a "Hallelujah"?
- Hallelujah, Stifler!

294
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,280
But, my fuckers,

295
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,280
this mofo right here does not want
the Stif-meister,

296
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,800
the grand, fucking facilitator
to attend the wedding.

297
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,080
Who sucks donkey dick?
Jim sucks donkey dick!

298
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,240
Jim sucks donkey dick!
The answer's no. Okay? I'm sorry.

299
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,160
The answer's no.
I can dance.

300
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,080
What?
I can dance.

301
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,960
Jim sucks donkey dick!
Jim sucks donkey dick!

302
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,560
Five, six, seven, eight.

303
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,080
Okay. Now-Now what
exactly is this here?

304
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,120
Left box turn.
Left box turn.

305
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,080
Hi. Stop looking into
my eyes. Sorry. Sorry.

306
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,080
How do you...
How do you know how to do this?

307
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,480
My mom made me take it for three fucking years.
Yeah?

308
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah, I hated it.
No, you're really good.

309
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,480
Uh, you should take ballet
or something.

310
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,240
Fuckface! What part of "This sucks my ass"
do you not under-fuckin'- stand?

311
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,680
This is exactly what I'm talking about,
Steven. You can't behave like this.

312
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,000
I-If you want to come to the wedding,
I'm sorry, you cannot act like this.

313
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,920
Are you saying
I'm impolite or something?

314
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,320
Impolite would be
an improvement. Look,

315
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,640
just... just try not to be,
uh, you know, uh,

316
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,640
you.

317
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,160
Fuck this shit.
It's not worth it.

318
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Hey, wait, Stifler.
Stifler, hold on.

319
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,440
Wait. Okay. Wh-What if, uh... What if you,
uh, plan the bachelor party?

320
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,800
With a dildo show?
Sure.

321
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,680
Look. Just... If you can find the time,
uh, to fit it in,

322
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,880
go ahead, surprise me.

323
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,960
Jim, your suspicions
are confirmed.

324
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,400
Michelle wants a dress
that she can't get.

325
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,360
The dress she wants is Amsale.
They have a store in Chicago.

326
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
Now, if we leave right now,

327
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,320
we can get there by the time they close...
a three-hour drive.

328
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
A three-hour drive?
Kick fuckin'ass.

329
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,160
Are we going to Chicago
to see titties?

330
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,440
We are talking about getting Michelle
a dress in Chicago.

331
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,480
Now, please, vanish.

332
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,800
Hey, Finch, what's the capital
of Thailand?

333
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,720
Bangkok!

334
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,360
Dude...
Hey, I got shotgun.

335
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,400
Let's get this dress shit over with.

336
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,040
The strip bar has got
free hot wings before 7:00.

337
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,440
Now, Jim, let me handle this.

338
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,640
These are my people.
They're gay?

339
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,160
No, you bleeding imbecile.
They have style. They're cultured.

340
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,360
- They're sophisticated.
- So they're gay.

341
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,240
So, mademoiselle,
I'm sure that you can appreciate...

342
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,880
that monsieur here is stuck right between
Scylla and Charybdis.

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,800
Yes, I'm afraid he's no Ulysses.

344
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,400
- Okay, what's happening here?
- You need to speak to my dressmaker.

345
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,640
That's who would actually make the dress.
And I'm afraid Leslie has gone for the day.

346
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,520
All right. She-She said she'd probably be
at one of these bars here on Halstead.

347
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,200
I say we split up and ask around
for a Leslie Summers.

348
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,120
Right.

349
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Hey there, sweet little thing.

350
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,920
Hey there, you sweet manly thing.

351
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,360
You know, I really love your shirt.
Do I know you?

352
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,240
I'm Jennifer.
Well, Jennifer,

353
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,840
just relax, take it slow...

354
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,760
and let the good times roll.

355
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,600
'Cause Daddy's a regular here.
Do you want to get a drink?

356
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,880
You're goddamn right I do.
Whoo-hoo!

357
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,840
Whoo. Two cold ones.

358
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,320
Hey, you know, my friend would really
dig your vibe. Will you wait here?

359
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,600
Sure thing, babe.
Good.

360
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,520
All right.

361
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,480
How you feeling, sexy?
Pretty good.

362
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,680
Whoa. You have a deep voice.

363
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,120
That's not all.

364
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,040
Oh, right.

365
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,680
You look really cute tonight.
Thanks.

366
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,560
I guess. What the...

367
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,040
Oh, hey.
Gettin' a little frisky.

368
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,600
Oh. Game over.

369
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,920
What's happening here?

370
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
Hey. Any luck?

371
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,040
- Not so much.
- All right. Let's, uh...

372
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,440
This is Bear.

373
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,920
Hey.
Wow. You are a bear.

374
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,840
- Yeah.

375
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,800
How much you bench?

376
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,320
- How much you weigh?
- Why?

377
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
You wanna try
and pick me up?

378
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,640
Yeah, I think I could.

379
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,960
Yeah, I bet you could.
You are big.

380
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,200
I could use
a guy like you on my team.

381
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,920
Are you... Are you talking about
our team or an actual team?

382
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,320
What the hell is "our team"?

383
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,240
Hi. Where's the girl?

384
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,160
What the fuck
are we talking about?

385
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,880
You need to take
another look around.

386
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,560
- Hey, honey.! - Oh, my God.
What the fuck is going on?

387
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,960
- Come on.
Is that all you got?

388
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,880
Pussy!

389
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,400
I, uh... I must have came
to the wrong place. Stifler.

390
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,520
Stifler.
Oh, man.

391
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,600
Hey.
Oh, it's so good to see you.

392
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,000
L... How did you get up the nerve
to check out a gay bar?

393
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah. Really don't wanna talk about it
right now. I just wanna go home.

394
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
- Your friend here was just leaving.
- Eat shit.

395
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,560
Did you find Leslie?
Fuck your stupid dressmaker, man.

396
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,000
- You guys know Leslie Summers?
- Uh, we're trying to find her.

397
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,600
You know what? I think you guys are
out of luck. Why don't you go home?

398
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,920
No. Y-You know Leslie... He knows Leslie S...
Okay, look.

399
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,680
My friends and I just drove
all the way from Michigan...

400
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,360
to find my fiancée the wedding dress
that she deserves.

401
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,920
Now, we need Leslie to make it for us.
Can-Can you please help us find her?

402
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm sure Leslie always helps
associates of assholes.

403
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,600
What are you looking at?
I'm not a steak.

404
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,360
Listen, breeder, not every gay man
wants to have sex with you.

405
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,160
Oh, yeah?
Listen up, ass jockey.

406
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,560
If I were gay, you'd want me.
Really.

407
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,920
Really. I got style.

408
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,640
I'm cultured.
I'm sophisticated.

409
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,800
And all that just radiates
from your oh, so sexy self.

410
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
That's bullshit.

411
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760
Everyone wants a piece of the
Stif-meister.

412
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,800
Right! Yeah!

413
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,920
Without a doubt!

414
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,880
- I'll show you fuckers.
- Bye.

415
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,760
Everybody say, "Bye. '"Bye.

416
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,280
Bye.

417
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Bye.
Good luck with the dress.

418
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,080
Give us a drink.

419
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,760
Mother of God.

420
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,920
Bitch!

421
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,440
Whoo-hoo.!

422
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,000
What is this, a dance-off?

423
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, yeah?

424
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,320
Go, big boy.!

425
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,560
I love you!

426
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,520
What?

427
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,080
Fabulous. Seeing that
was worth anything.

428
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,000
Look, I'm Leslie Summers,
and you've got yourself a dress.

429
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Thank you. Oh, my God.
Thank you.

430
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,120
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

431
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,760
Yeah, no problem.
Hey, who's your friend? Uh, K-Kevin.

432
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,800
Was that the best night
ever or what? Stifler,

433
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,000
are you... are you kidding me?
It was amazing.

434
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,960
Hey, guys!
Hey, hey.

435
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,920
Hey, when you get your bachelor party
together, I manage some girls in town.

436
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,880
Real ones.
All right.

437
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,880
Call me. Damn, Stiffy,
you got some moves.

438
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,680
Told you that guy
wanted to fuck me.

439
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,740
I can't believe this. They're really
gonna make the dress for me?

440
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,540
They are expecting your call.
Go ahead. This is so cool. Oh.

441
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
I love you.

442
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,660
Thank you.

443
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,820
Well, that worked out.

444
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,180
Well, maybe it's time we have
that special dinner chat.

445
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,220
I'll have turkey.

446
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,700
Thanks for helping out.

447
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,380
We're so close, and there's still so
much to do.

448
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,340
Cadence!

449
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,460
Hey.
Hi.

450
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,140
Cadence, this is Paul Finch. Finch,
meet my younger sister, Cadence.

451
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,820
Nice to meet you.
You're reading Descartes.

452
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,740
Yep.

453
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,860
Cogito ergo sum.
"I think, therefore I am. "

454
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:27,900
Hungry.

455
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,100
So, when's Mark getting in?

456
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,500
Uh, let's see,
that would be never.

457
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,300
Did you guys break up?
How tragic.

458
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,500
Uh, sorry, Paul Finch.
Girl stuff.

459
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,340
Just stay calm. I'm available,
she's available. It's all good.

460
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,420
She's a beautiful girl,
and you're you.

461
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,180
I dumped him.

462
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,980
But it was Mark. I thought
you really liked him. He was nice.

463
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,660
Yeah, but sometimes nice isn't so nice.

464
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,700
W- Wait. Hold on.
Let me get this straight.

465
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,060
He didn't want to do it. He said he
didn't want to ruin what we had...

466
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,980
by deflowering ourselves.

467
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,900
Who the hell uses
the word deflower?

468
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,100
That's like something Mom would say.
Yeah.

469
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,260
And I'm starting to realize that Mom and
Dad's idea of appropriate behaviour...

470
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,220
might be a little bit different than mine.

471
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,340
Mitch, you're in love.
Shh.

472
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,460
You're getting married.
I mean, what's this like?

473
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,980
It's like it's...
I'm never gonna be able to explain it.

474
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,420
I wanted us to write our own vows for
the wedding, and now I can't do mine.

475
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,740
L... How do you explain love?

476
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,620
Uh, I-I guess
I wouldn't know.

477
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,780
I don't think I've ever
felt that way about a guy.

478
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,740
Oh, someday you will.
Maybe.

479
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,340
But in the meantime, I don't think it would
hurt to get a little rowdy this weekend.

480
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,580
Jim's got single friends,
right? Yes.

481
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,980
- Think Finch is a possibility?
- Oh, Finch is boneable.

482
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,700
Yes, he is boneable.

483
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,900
Dickhead. You do not send shit
to my office at school.

484
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,460
Hey, Stifler. Why don't you come in
and make yourself comfortable?

485
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,460
Your letter made a great impression on
Coach Marshall when he read it.

486
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,740
Let me just refresh your memory,
partner. "Dear Steve,

487
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,540
I will be forever in your debt if you teach
me to dance like you did in the gay bar. "

488
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,460
I put serious thought
into that letter.

489
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,260
"Don't push me 'cause I'm
close to the edge.

490
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,660
I'm trying not to
lose my head. " Uh-huh.

491
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,620
Uh-huh.

492
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,020
These are really nice. I mean,
for a bridesmaid dress.

493
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,460
- At least something you can actually
wear again. - Wear again.

494
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,700
But you don't think
it's too sexy, do you?

495
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,380
I mean, I don't want to seem slutty or anything.
I'm trying to attract a decent guy here.

496
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,140
It's a wedding.
They'll all be decent guys.

497
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,060
I just don't feel quite like a virgin in it.

498
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,980
Oh!

499
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,620
So, you guys have to be psyched
to be done with college.

500
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,940
I mean, I swear, I'm running out of
room in my brain for everything.

501
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,500
There's always room for
Plato and Aristotle.

502
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,500
Some of my favourites.

503
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,540
Excuse me, guys.

504
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,500
Finch,
she thinks you were being sarcastic.

505
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,140
Okay. It's so good to see you.

506
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,020
You want some help? Here. Let me...
Let me help you out there.

507
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,500
There you go. Okay.
You keep fighting the good fight, sir.

508
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,460
It's great.

509
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,420
That was really sweet of you.

510
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,460
Yeah. I love old people.

511
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,060
Hey, I hate to be nosy
and impolite, but, um,

512
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,900
do you know Jim Levenstein and
Michelle Flaherty? Yeah.

513
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,380
Are they here?
Well, I'm Cadence, Michelle's sister.

514
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,420
I had no idea.
I'm their good friend Steven.

515
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,860
Well, it's nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.

516
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,580
Well, they're around town doing
some wedding stuff. That's cool.

517
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,780
But there's still a few of us in the
other room if you want to join us.

518
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,420
I don't know. I mean, you look so nice,
I feel underdressed.

519
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,540
Well, I think you look great.
Thank you.

520
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,980
Oh, here they are.
Hi, boys. Don't stand up.

521
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,820
- The dads aren't here yet?
- I'll go find him.

522
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,340
Now, which one of you
is the best man?

523
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,300
Jim didn't pick just one.
Or I mean, he-he couldn't decide.

524
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,860
- Hey, Paul. Hey, Kevin.
- Mom, I want you to meet Steven.

525
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,260
He's friends of Jim’s and mine and,
oh, everyone's.

526
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,420
You look very familiar,
Steven.

527
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,820
Really? Oh, I'm afraid
we've never met. Oh.

528
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,940
Oh. Well, we have now.

529
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,220
Oh, looks like you found
Samantha's Sweets.

530
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,180
Oh, yes.
Isn't their chocolate just to die for?

531
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,700
- Oh, well, you have no idea.
- Actually, I do.

532
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,100
I love chocolate more than life itself.
More than life itself.

533
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,500
Yes.! I was just saying
to your friends that...

534
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,500
I have something
very precious here.

535
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,660
What is it?

536
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,180
Michelle's grandmother's...
my mother's... wedding ring.

537
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,380
Isn't that precious?

538
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,100
But since all of you
are the best man,

539
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,020
I don't know who should
ho-hold onto it.

540
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,060
- I think it's best if I...
- Oh, um...

541
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,420
I think you should get to know us first
and then decide.

542
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,260
You are such a gentleman, Steve.

543
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,420
I hear that all the time, but it never gets old.
Aw.

544
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,620
Hey, Paul, uh, do you have a camera?

545
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,420
How thoughtful.

546
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,620
I must have forgotten
my camera at home, Steven.

547
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,020
Oh, m-maybe you could take,
like, a mental note.

548
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,220
- I won't forget this moment.

549
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,500
I bet you won't.
Would you care to join us?

550
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,540
I would love to.
Thank you. Well, come on.

551
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,580
Lovely to see you fellas.
Thank you.

552
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,580
Oh, amazing.

553
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,740
What the hell is he doing
near my flowers?

554
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,260
I love the way the tulips
accentuate the, um...

555
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,100
- What do you call those again, sir?
- Double Lisianthus.

556
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,020
Lisianthus.
Double "Lisianthums. "

557
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,260
What a pretty name.

558
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,140
I told him to be nice,
or-or he couldn't come to the wedding.

559
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,420
I will take care of this. I will take care of this.
Hey. Hey, James.

560
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,740
Oh, great. Come on over.
Oh, great. Come on over.

561
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,020
See if I forgot anything.
I don't think... Oh. Oh, oh.

562
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,420
We're having a great time.
I think I've got it all.

563
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,340
Oh, look, look, look, look.

564
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,740
- Sahara and Desert Rose...

565
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,980
for your bridesmaids' bouquet.

566
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,700
Oh, give me that.
Smell this.

567
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,620
It's fantastic.
Fantastic.

568
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,300
And, oh... Oh. Oh!

569
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,220
Oh, oh, oh!

570
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,980
Look at this.

571
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,780
Oh, boy. Let's go look at
the candelabrum, honey.

572
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,020
I think with the Summer Blossoms.
Mm-hmm.

573
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,940
Cutie.
Thank you for everything.

574
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,540
What do you think, girls?
Isn't this adorable? Bye, Cadence.

575
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,700
Okay, I know... I know what you're doing.
Look. Have you seen yourself?

576
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,780
I can't believe you're doing this.
Just calm down, dude.

577
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,700
It's all set.
What's set?

578
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,100
I'm gonna teach you to dance
like a "Baryshiniankov. "

579
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,540
Oh, yeah.
He is pretty good.

580
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,900
Jim, he's not doing it to be nice.
He's doing it to bone Cadence.

581
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,060
Look, maybe we should give him a chance.
You know, I think... I think...

582
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,460
that underneath all the fucks
and shits and blow mes,

583
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,500
there's a very sensitive person
who is just thirsty for acceptance.

584
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,540
That's-That's what I think.

585
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,020
Oh, Jim, you've gotta stop masturbating.
It's melting your brain.

586
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,780
Observe the fuckin' Stif-meister.

587
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,700
What is his defining characteristic?

588
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,100
He uses the F-word excessively.

589
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,060
Thanks, man.

590
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,140
But I also have confidence.
You're one big floppy cock.

591
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,300
Look at you.
You've gotta stand like a man.

592
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,700
Your posture tells your partner
where to go.

593
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,780
Okay. Okay.
Okay?

594
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,780
Follow my lead.

595
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,100
This is the waltz.
Waltz. Okay.

596
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,540
Waltz. Okay.

597
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,300
That's pretty good.
You're fuckin' right it's good.

598
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,740
I'm gonna save your ass
in this wedding.

599
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,180
Pretty soon you're gonna
want me to shave your balls.

600
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,340
Should I shave my balls? Do you shave
your balls? How do you do it?

601
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,420
Dude, no.

602
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,100
L... I... I'm just...

603
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,060
Shaving.

604
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,980
You know, there's nothing like
a local pub.

605
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,900
Mm-hmm.
It's like real America...

606
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,460
without all that corporateness and catchy jingles.
Well, what's wrong with a good jingle?

607
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,060
I think it was Voltaire who said,

608
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,140
"A jingle witty proves everything
for my friends and I."

609
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,660
- Cadence.

610
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,580
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

611
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,820
You're just in time
for Voltaire's greatest hits.

612
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,020
Voltaire?
Stifler, please, who was Voltaire?

613
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,940
Someone much wiser than you,
I'm afraid, Finch.

614
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,260
Actually, I'm getting a little burned out
on all the intellectual stuff.

615
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,180
Yeah. Me too.

616
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,020
Being smart is so hard.

617
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,180
I'll give you some intelligence.

618
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,900
Voltaire can suck on my balls.

619
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,100
What?

620
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,580
It's about time somebody
finally came out and said it.

621
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,740
Hey, I'm gonna give you a quote to live by.

622
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,660
"Love life, get paid and then get laid. "

623
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,100
That is the basic philosophy
of the Finch-meister.

624
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,420
I like that.

625
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,740
- Bet you do.
- But I don't know why you do...

626
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,940
because Finch-meister doesn't
make any friggin' sense.

627
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,860
- Sure, it does.
- No fuckin' shit it does.

628
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,580
Cadence, let's leave
the "crayton" here, shall we?

629
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,740
Whatever. Fuck it.
I'm walkin' anyway.

630
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,700
Wait. You know, actually, I think I'm gonna
go stretch my legs with the Finch-meister.

631
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,260
- You don't mind, do you, Steven?
- No.

632
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,260
Ha!

633
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,500
It's on like Donkey Kong, bi-i-itch.

634
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,420
Pack it up, bitch.

635
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,340
I'm on it. Thank you.

636
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,460
So, uh, Cadence say
anything about me?

637
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,540
Whatever you and Finch are pulling,
she seems to like you both.

638
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,100
Finch. Is she gonna be
around tomorrow night?

639
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,220
No, she's going up to Chicago
with Michelle for the final dress fitting.

640
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,460
What about her parents?
I think her mom kind of likes me.

641
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,460
They're going up north with,
uh... with my parents...

642
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,380
for, uh... you know, to get things, uh,
ready for the rehearsal.

643
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,780
So, uh...
So that's where they'll be.

644
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,180
So don't bother looking for them or anything,
you know.

645
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,380
A wedding.

646
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,980
Shit. How do you know
she's the right girl?

647
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,980
I just do.

648
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,540
I'm a better person when I'm with Michelle.
Nobody else can... No, no, no, shithead.

649
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,100
You hooked up with one other girl for,
what, 10 seconds.

650
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,460
Not to mention you passed on Nadia.
Dumbest fuckin' thing ever.

651
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,980
You're like a blind man picking
out his favourite porno.

652
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,940
This shit is crazy.

653
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,500
This is just the old pre-wedding jitters,
son.

654
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,100
It's so forever, you know. It-It's, uh...

655
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,500
You know, Michelle is the only, uh,

656
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,420
girl that I've... I've been with.

657
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,180
Honestly, now... Honestly, would you
have passed up sex with Nadia?

658
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,380
Why? Did she say something?

659
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,780
Hypothetically, Dad.
Oh, hypothetically.

660
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,300
Well, I mean, you know,
Jim, I'm a married man.

661
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,620
I'm...
If-If-If you weren't married.

662
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,620
She's a college girl.
If you were a college guy.

663
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,220
In a heartbeat.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,980
First of all, what-what you're feeling is
so normal and perfectly natural.

665
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,780
Marriage is not about, uh, animal lusting
and-and kinky sex games.

666
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,260
It's not so much about who's the dog
and who's the fire hydrant tonight.

667
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,180
It's-It's deeper than that.

668
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,060
The longer a marriage lasts,

669
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,980
uh, the longer you can go,

670
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,900
uh, without sex.

671
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,300
But when that magic night
does happen, uh,

672
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,220
it's-it's all the more meaningful.

673
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,260
And let me tell you,
your mother, bless her,

674
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
can still make me, uh,
squeal like a pig.

675
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,820
Uh, and I mean that in the good sense, son.
Do you follow what I'm saying?

676
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,380
You understand where I'm going?
I do. I, uh... I think I, uh...

677
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,060
Anything else you need?
No. No, that's, uh...

678
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,940
Anything I can do.

679
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,740
He's not here. Park the cars down
there where he won't see them.

680
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,180
Hoo! Fuckin' right!

681
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,380
So, you like my pants, Stiffy? Whatever,
dude. As long as the girls are worth it.

682
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,060
They're worth it. Oh, and if you've got some
good wine too, that'll score some points for you.

683
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,900
- We think there's some in the...
in the basement. - I'll get it.

684
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,820
You ain't gonna want to miss this.

685
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,500
Gentlemen.

686
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,860
Gentlemen, I would like to introduce...

687
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,180
Officer Krystal und Frauline Brandi.

688
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,420
Oh, my God.

689
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,980
Oh.! Oh.! Oh.! Yeah.!

690
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,980
- Oh, my God!
- You boys have been very messy.

691
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,340
Whoops.
Can you see my fanny?

692
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,140
Ohh!

693
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,400
Oh!

694
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,500
- You naughty girl.

695
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,140
None of that pleading the Fifth crap!

696
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,080
Wow.!

697
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,640
Oh, my God!

698
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,640
Are you just gonna stand there and drool?

699
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,600
- Or are we gonna have a bachelor party?
- Fuck yeah, we are!

700
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,360
Yeah? What?
I can't hear you.

701
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,360
Louder!
Y- Y-Y-Y-Yes. Bachelor party.

702
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,920
Look, maybe we should
just wait for... Jim.

703
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,200
Fuck Jim, man! This is for us.
This is awesome!

704
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,600
Take her top off.

705
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,994
My girlfriend has strict rules
about this. No touching.

706
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,440
No, that's my favourite...

707
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,120
It was my favourite shirt.
Uh, okay.

708
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,180
Like I said, this is awesome.

709
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,540
Stifler, why in the world
are you focused on me?

710
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,340
I'm surprised to see
you don't have tits.

711
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,240
Go put something on that I must clean
off with my tongue.

712
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,320
Ah!

713
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,560
Oh, yeah.

714
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,840
Look at you, you pathetic,
little weasel.

715
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,560
Can't I just watch?

716
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Look, you don't have to do
anything if you don't want to.

717
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

718
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,320
Don't break character ever again.

719
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,240
Okay? I don't care if Kevin starts crying
because Finch bit his cock off.

720
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,880
You're a dirty cop, you're a prissy maid and I am your
filthy cabana boy in need of much punishment and cleaning.

721
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,720
Don't you ever mouth off
to Officer Krystal,

722
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,980
you dirty, little pervert!

723
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,740
Guys, are we having dinner?

724
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,380
Here, let me get that.

725
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,540
Holy shit!
Stifler.

726
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,180
I've got something really nice cooking
up for you. Well, we love surprises.

727
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,100
Stifler, you said you spoke to Jim. I did.
I was secret about it and everything.

728
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,380
He said he'd be the only one here
tonight. What the fuck, shit-brick?

729
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,540
Chocolate.
Ah, sh...

730
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,300
Now, I told everyone that you were
up north with my parents.

731
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,700
Okay. So we won't be bothered. We can
just, uh, totally relax and no worries.

732
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,980
Please come on in.

733
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,220
Make yourselves at home.
Right this way. Thank you.

734
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,140
Sir.

735
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,900
What?

736
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,260
Pink roses.

737
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,180
Pink roses.
Yeah.

738
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,740
They're nice, aren't they?
Yes. Artificial. Nice try.

739
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,500
Well...
I almost got ya.

740
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,820
Yeah. Well.

741
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,020
So, has Michelle ever told you
the story of how we fell in love?

742
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,540
Oh, why don't you retell us now?

743
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,140
It's... It's one of my favourite stories.
Where should I begin?

744
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,060
Um...

745
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,060
Let's see. Uh...

746
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,060
Well, I suppose, uh...
I suppose it all started at, um...

747
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,940
Tall Oaks.

748
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,300
That's-That's right.
At Tall Oaks.

749
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,220
That was the summer when, uh... Oh!

750
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,340
Oh! The summer that was so hot.

751
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,820
So hot.
All right. Look what I got.

752
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,740
Jesus!

753
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,660
Hey there.
Hi there.

754
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,220
Hey.
Jim, I cannot believe you.

755
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,180
- You can't? - You hired help on our
account? That is entirely unnecessary.

756
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,660
But I will have some of that wine, sir.

757
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,020
- Say, "Please," Harold.
- Please. Of course.

758
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,100
Absolutely. It's what he's here for,
is-is the wine, obviously.

759
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,900
Yes. Evidently.
What else would you be here for?

760
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,940
And-And-And I certainly appreciate
your-your-your courtesy, sir.

761
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,300
Ah. Uh, well, yes.

762
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,940
Uh, we have... we have right here
a 1999...

763
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,580
cabernet seve... um...

764
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,020
full-bodied, masculine wine.

765
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,900
Just shouts sophistication.

766
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,340
- James.
- Yes.

767
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,200
Well, I can see you're very surprised
to see me here.

768
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,179
A little bit.

769
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,420
I'm going to go check on the dogs.
Yes, yes!

770
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,420
In fact, why don't you both
go check on the dogs and...

771
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,820
No, no, no. Don't check on the dogs.
They're fine.

772
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,580
- How do you know?
- Because I just checked on the dogs.

773
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,100
Because he just checked on the dogs.
Good work, man. I did.

774
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,500
- Jim, I'll help you with the turkey.
- Okay.

775
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,380
Um, and I'll keep you company.

776
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,300
Thank you. Whoo.

777
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,540
So, how long have you been
a sommelier, Mr., um...

778
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,060
Belvedere, ma'am.
Oh. Belvedere.

779
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,580
So, how long do we have to
stay in here for?

780
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,060
I don't know.
They said to hide.

781
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,940
Who knows what kind of kinky shit
they're getting ready for us.

782
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,540
So, do these go
in your ass tonight or mine?

783
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,180
Do you have a serving dish ready?

784
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,140
- Jim.
- Hmm?

785
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,460
We need a serving dish.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

786
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,220
- Oh!
- What?

787
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,900
- Nothing.
- Then why the excitement?

788
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,260
I thought, uh, the-the dish was broken.

789
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,460
Well, is it?
No.

790
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,380
Then, are you going to get it?
Yes.

791
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,020
Here you go. One serving dish.
Excellent.

792
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,780
Now what we need...
a cutting board.

793
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,380
Huh? No, no, no, no!
Stop! What?

794
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,620
L- I will get it for you.
Nonsense. I can get a cutting board.

795
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,980
Ah, let's see. There you go.
This should do nicely.

796
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,700
I presume we're having
white wine with the turkey.

797
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,660
Uh, let me go check.

798
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,900
What happened here?

799
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,780
Oh, um, that... that's mud.

800
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,140
I meant to clean that up this morning.
How embarrassing.

801
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,700
That's gonna stain.
We're gonna need a mop.

802
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,060
I'll get it.
It's in this closet.

803
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,780
Oh! No, no, no!
No, it's not.

804
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,980
- It's in there.
- It's not in this closet...

805
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,500
because I-I, um...
I moved it... I moved it.

806
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,460
Well, where?
I'll go get it.

807
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,660
L- I don't...
I don't remember.

808
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,940
You don't remember?

809
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:29,280
You know why I don't remember
is because I actually did not move it.

810
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,360
The cleaning lady did.

811
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,540
Your mother said you don't have
a cleaning lady.

812
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,340
- I don't know why she would say such a...
- You called, master?

813
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,680
- Holy...
- Well, there you are.

814
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
- Hello.
- How do you do?

815
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,680
Uh, so, cleaning lady,

816
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,640
we were wondering
where... where the mop was.

817
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,460
Master put the mop
in my fanny.

818
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,980
- You what?
- Who put what where?

819
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,660
I did no such thing anywhere.

820
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,140
Shall I clean?

821
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,100
Harold.

822
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,640
Very well.
It is so hot in here.

823
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,340
Holy Jesus!

824
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,580
Oh, Brandi, Brandi. What are you doing?
You're not in Eastern Europe anymore.

825
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:26,240
You can't do that. I am so sorry about my
... my cousin. She's not used to our customs.

826
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,380
I'm very sorry for recommending
her to you, Jim.

827
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,520
Oh, here's, uh...
here's this mop.

828
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,060
Ah, yeah. Got the mop.

829
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,160
Brandi, you left the mop
in the car. Hmm?

830
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,720
Now remember, it's called a car,
not a fanny.

831
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:44,620
You remember last time when you wanted
me to take a ride in your fanny?

832
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,160
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.

833
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,280
You know what?
We should probably just go.

834
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,800
I'm so sorry about this. I just came by
to make sure everything was in order.

835
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,600
Ooh, food smells great!

836
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,880
Au revoir.

837
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,280
Jim, you have unique friends.

838
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,720
Harold!
Let's get that cleaned up.

839
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,760
Um, I think I saw some Pine-Sol in
here too.

840
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,280
Aye-yay-yay.
Oh, my God!

841
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,240
Oh, my Lord.!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

842
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,680
He's okay. Are you all right?
Are you okay?

843
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,280
Who did this to you? I'm sure he's okay.
Are you okay?

844
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,880
Get some help! Harold, call the police!
No, no, please.

845
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,220
- All right!
- Jesus!

846
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,180
I'll take charge from here.

847
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,440
- They are fast here. And nicely attired.
- What's going on here?

848
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,800
- She's here to protect and serve.
- Quiet!

849
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,400
- Okay.
- Who let this boy out of the closet?

850
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,560
You are all in for
a hard punishment now.

851
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,580
Don't you touch him.
He's been hurt.

852
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,340
- No, this is hurt!
- Ow!

853
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,640
You can't do that.
Silence, fucker!

854
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,640
- Ow!
- Oh, you like it.

855
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,400
- Oh!
- Harold!

856
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,760
What's gotten into you?
I meant "ow. "

857
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,460
- You're a disgrace to the police force.
- I'll be giving you an enema!

858
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,400
Hey, somebody untie me.!

859
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,660
- Back off!
- All right, forget it. We give up.

860
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,100
Oh, Steven! Steven!

861
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,900
- Oh, it's okay, Mary.
- What's going on?

862
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,560
Listen. This isn't
working, guys.

863
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,580
Krystal, you can drop the act.
This isn't a real cop.

864
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,060
Kevin wasn't assaulted.

865
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,660
I just wanted to make Jim
look good for you guys.

866
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,060
Like a real hero.
Kind of like me.

867
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,420
So, we hired a fake cop and we tied
up Kevin and put him in the closet.

868
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,360
Jim was supposed to rescue him,
untie him, give him mouth-to-mouth.

869
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,100
I don't know
what he likes to do.

870
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,420
You know, and then Paul Finchhired an
exotic dancer instead of a real actor.

871
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,940
Jim, is this true?

872
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,260
- Every word of it. - That is the stupidest
idea I have ever heard.

873
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:37,340
You've embarrassed me and Harold
and Mr. Belvedere.

874
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,140
It's all my fault.
I'm a bad person.

875
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:45,500
Oh, you're not a bad person. You were
just trying to help out your best friend.

876
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,420
And it was an awful idea. But I suppose
it's the thought that counts.

877
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,660
You know, actually, um...

878
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,860
Actually, I-I never
should have allowed...

879
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,660
such a... such a crazy plan
to happen in the first place.

880
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:05,300
If you're gonna blame anybody here,
blame me.

881
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,500
Well, I'm sorry, Jim. I didn't realize how
much pressure we put on you.

882
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,100
I'm sure you both learned your lesson
and I suppose I understand.

883
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,860
Jim, if you put half as much energy into
your marriage as you put into tonight,

884
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,100
I'm confident that I can give you
my blessing.

885
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,700
And, Steven, we still adore you,
honey.

886
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,420
In fact, I think I know
who should hold onto this.

887
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,100
We adore you.
You'll take good care of it.

888
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,860
You've gotta be kidding me.
No.

889
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,460
Look it, Jim. Kevin. Boy, this really makes
me important to the wedding, huh?

890
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,460
Yes.

891
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,380
Well, Mr. Belvedere, it's gonna
be one fucked-up wedding.

892
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,960
Absolutely.

893
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,280
- Drive carefully.
- There's more bags in the study.

894
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,740
Thank you.
You're welcome.

895
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,380
Ow! Is there any room
for me?

896
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,260
Uh, nope.

897
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,940
Oh, I'll just drive up north
all by myself.

898
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,100
That sounds good.
We'll see you later.

899
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,780
No, I'll drive with you.
Oh, thanks, Cadence.

900
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,740
- Beautiful lady.
- Sure.

901
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,340
- Hey, Finch... I know, shut up.
- Kevin.

902
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,660
So, my mom found the dogs playing with
something unusual this morning.

903
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,540
What?
I told her it was a neck massager.

904
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,460
Oh, these are great.

905
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,400
You're gonna have
a fun weekend, Ma.

906
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,240
I am missing my soap.
Well, don't you worry about your soaps.

907
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,160
Will you push faster?
I'm tired.

908
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,760
And wait till you meet Michelle.
You're gonna love her. She's sweet as sugar.

909
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,520
I can't eat sugar.
I know, because you're diabetic.

910
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,200
You know, Ma, I know things haven't
been going well for you. I know that.

911
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,880
But wait till you see Jim standing
up there at the altar tomorrow.

912
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,440
I mean, if ever there was a time to be
happy and smile the biggest smile,

913
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,720
now is the time.
Okay. Okay!

914
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,240
I'm overjoyed.

915
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,680
That's... That's a start.

916
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,840
Proud grandmother
coming through.

917
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,840
Grandsons getting married tomorrow.

918
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,680
You think she's happy now?
Wait till tomorrow.

919
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,520
Congratulations.

920
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,400
Grooming.

921
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,000
The flowers stay refrigerated
until morning.

922
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,840
- Just as we made them.
- Oh, I'm sure they will.

923
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,200
Oh, my...

924
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:20,000
- Oh! Ah!
- Oh, Jimmy, no!

925
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

926
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,240
I hope you'll be more careful
with the next one.

927
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,000
My kitchen is not a toilet.
Okay?

928
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,320
Boy, pubic hair was just not an issue
when I was dating.

929
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,280
The ladies, uh, never complained
when they were...

930
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,200
you know, down in that general area.

931
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,560
Okay, if you never mention that
ever again, that'd be great.

932
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,040
You're right. No, no, no. Okay.
Shouldn't have brought it up. Maybe...

933
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,960
So, can I see the ring?

934
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,400
Nope. Promised to keep it safe.
It's not leaving my pocket.

935
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,680
Okay, Frodo.

936
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,440
You really care about
this wedding, don't you?

937
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,480
Yeah. I'm gonna cry
at the ceremony.

938
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,400
I know it.

939
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,480
Are you just saying
all of this?

940
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:26,040
I mean, do you act differently
around certain people? Namely me.

941
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,960
Of course not. Why? Do you act
differently around me?

942
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,320
Generally I'm just me. If people don't
like it, then that's their problem, right?

943
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,360
Yeah. Fuck those fuckers.

944
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,280
What?

945
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,760
- I... I didn't... - No, you know, you're right.
Fuck 'em.

946
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,600
- Hey, Harold and Mary.
- Oh, hi, kids. - Hi.

947
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,140
How's it going?

948
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:55,460
Thanks for, um... Come on.
Thanks for watching the dogs.

949
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,020
I love these guys. Hey, you guys want
more Snausages? Huh? There you go.

950
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,580
- Eat 'em up, fellas.
- Give me some.

951
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,460
Oh, there you go.
I don't think I have any left.

952
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,940
- What's wrong?
- Oh, shit.

953
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,820
- Are you okay?

954
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,220
Yeah.

955
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,740
- You kissed Stifler?
- Yeah, but then he freaked.

956
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,500
And it's like he's been paying more
attention to the dogs than me.

957
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,420
Can I stop worrying then? Michelle,
he's been nothing but nice to me.

958
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,500
I mean, do you think
he really likes you? Like...

959
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,180
I don't know.
I hope he likes me.

960
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,620
I mean, I think
he likes me.

961
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,460
We're... Well, yeah, I guess
I hope he likes me.

962
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,540
Do it.

963
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,460
Don't fuck around.

964
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,100
Just relax and let it go.

965
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,020
I'm sick of waiting.

966
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,420
Do it for Daddy.

967
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,260
Will you just take a shit already?

968
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,420
Great.

969
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,660
You fed the ring to the dogs,
didn't you?

970
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:10,340
Of course not.

971
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,420
You have been staring at those dogs
like a hawk all day.

972
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,860
I'm a dog lover.

973
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,180
Oh, and by the way...

974
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,900
apparently you missed
when Cadence kissed me.

975
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,060
Slight tongue action too.

976
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,060
It was something like this.

977
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,860
You're a terrible liar, Stifler.

978
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:32,060
If I were lying, I'd think of something
better than a kiss.

979
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,880
Game over for you, Finch.

980
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,440
Oh, fuckin' right, doggy!

981
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,620
It's about goddamn time.
Jackpot.!

982
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:45,260
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some shit to attend to.

983
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,520
Great!

984
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,760
Thanks, assholes.

985
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,020
You know, maybe you can call them.
Oh, okay.

986
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,940
Steve, come over here.

987
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,480
Uh, I'm a little busy.

988
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,800
With what? Come on over.
We need you.

989
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,400
- Get over here, you little rascal. - We were
just talking about Michelle's wedding band.

990
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,320
Could I see it?

991
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,920
Um, no.

992
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,200
- No?
- I don't have it.

993
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,360
What? You mean you lost it?
Of course not.

994
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,160
I'm keeping it safe in my room,
you silly Sally.

995
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,840
- I apologize.
- That's fine. I'll just see it later.

996
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,560
Okay. All right then. What do you have
in your hand there?

997
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,120
- This one?
- No, the other one.

998
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,560
It's a chocolate truffle.
Ooh, yummy.!

999
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,680
Where did you get that?

1000
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,400
Oh, the caterer said she was saving
the truffles for tomorrow.

1001
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,360
You sneaky devil.

1002
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,960
Well, hey, I managed
to sneak one right past her.

1003
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,240
Oh, come on.
This woman loves chocolate.

1004
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,680
- At least give her a tiny nibble.
- Give it to Mama.

1005
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,920
Mama don't want this.
This is the only piece that I have.

1006
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,680
- Idiot.
- Well, break it in half. Come on.

1007
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,720
You know what? Let's just leave
the surprises till tomorrow, huh, guys?

1008
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,520
- It's gonna be a great day.
- I'd like my surprise right now.

1009
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,520
- No, it's mine!
- Steven, give it to me.

1010
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,160
- No.
- Give me the "G" darn truffle.

1011
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,800
Steven, that is so selfish.

1012
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,800
- Mm, it's good.
- Is it? Is it sweet?

1013
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,120
It's so sweet.

1014
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,880
- Close your mouth when you chew, Steven.
- Don't do that.

1015
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,640
At least you could describe to the
lovely woman how delicious it is.

1016
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,720
Well, tastes like twigs
and berries.

1017
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,520
- Is it fresh?
- Oh, it's so fresh.

1018
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,400
- Nothing better than when they're fresh.
- Nothing better.

1019
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,220
- Droppings from the gods.
- Ooh!

1020
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,140
Get me another one, darling.
Come on.

1021
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,020
Hey, look, man. I gotta go.

1022
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,620
Okay. Off with ya.

1023
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,840
Grandma, I want you
to meet some people.

1024
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,880
Grandma, this is Michelle.

1025
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,800
I'm so proud to be joining your family.

1026
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,440
She's real pretty, huh?

1027
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,920
Isn't it great?
We're getting married.

1028
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,960
It's amazing, Gram.

1029
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:40,400
Not Jewish. No wedding, Jimmy!
No wedding.

1030
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,960
Forget it. Goy.!
Grandma?

1031
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,000
- Shit.
- Jim, she hates me.

1032
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,760
Oh, my God!
Grandma!

1033
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,800
Grandma, we love each other.

1034
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,840
Michelle and I love each other
very much.

1035
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,560
And that's all that matters.
Grandma.! Grandma.

1036
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,880
Michelle. Michelle.

1037
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,960
But, uh, Grandma's okay.

1038
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,760
Oh, she's okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, Dad.
She's okay. She's just a little tired.

1039
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,560
Okay. My mother
hasn't been well.

1040
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,820
When your dad sees the look
on Grandma's face...

1041
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,080
it's... it's gonna
break his heart.

1042
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,920
- Because of me.
- It's not because of you.

1043
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,920
Michelle, it's not because
of you at all.

1044
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,760
It's because Grandma thinks
it's 1801.

1045
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,640
Look. Don't... Don't worry.
I will... I'll come up with something.

1046
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,680
I promised you
the wedding of your dreams,

1047
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,680
and I'm not gonna let
anything ruin it.

1048
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,800
Oh.

1049
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,760
I would like to propose a toast.

1050
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,000
These last few weeks have really been
something for my lovely wife and me.

1051
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,040
We have met some people
we didn't know existed.

1052
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,560
We've experienced some things
we didn't think were possible.

1053
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,600
We've always tried to make
the best of every situation.

1054
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,360
- This is a good situation.
- That's what I'm saying.

1055
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,760
This is a wonderful situation.

1056
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,320
The coming together of two families
from different backgrounds.

1057
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,680
So, to our new son-in-law,
may we say Erin Go Braugh.

1058
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,600
To our lovely daughter
Michelle, L'chaim.

1059
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,800
- Did I get that right?
- Very good.

1060
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,680
Uh, and let's hope we can sip
many happy shivas together.

1061
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,840
Here's to a wonderful wedding.

1062
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,120
Cheers.

1063
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,540
See that, shit-brick.
Told you I won.

1064
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,400
Hey.
Hey.

1065
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:34,320
So, I just wanted to say I'm sorry if
I freaked you out with the whole kiss thing.

1066
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,280
You didn't freak me out.

1067
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,720
I just wanted
to let you know that...

1068
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,840
you make me feel special.

1069
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,040
I think you're the most
special girl I've ever known.

1070
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,640
Maybe you'd wanna make things
extra special tonight.

1071
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,080
Which room is yours?

1072
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,520
I'm crashing at Kevin's.

1073
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,080
Damn.
But I saw...

1074
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,160
like a big, fluffy linen closet
at the end of the main hallway.

1075
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,520
Yes. Big, fluffy linen closet is good.
Okay.

1076
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,000
Midnight? All right.
Yeah. Okay.

1077
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,120
Oh!

1078
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,880
Gonna have sex with Cadence

1079
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,920
Gonna have sex with Cadence

1080
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,080
Whoo! Uh-huh.

1081
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,800
Cadence
Jesus!

1082
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,160
You fuckin' stalker.

1083
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,400
You're nota very stealthy thief.

1084
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,960
Oh, really?
Guess what, shit-brick, it's a wedding.

1085
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,280
Everything's free.
What do you want?

1086
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,560
Well, Stifler, Jim's grandma
doesn't approve of the wedding.

1087
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,840
We're trying to run
interference and,

1088
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,600
reluctantly, I am asking for your help.

1089
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,040
Hmm. Sorry, Finch-meister.
I got plans with Cadence.

1090
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,440
Stifler, maybe you could forget about your
dick for one second and actually be useful.

1091
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,080
Fuck you, Finch.

1092
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,480
You didn't eat shit, okay?

1093
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,120
You didn't prance around here
like a ballerina for the whole week.

1094
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,280
"Oh, wedding" this.
"Suck my ass" that.

1095
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,760
"I'm special. You're special. " We're all
just a bunch of special fuckers, aren't we?

1096
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,840
Well, you know what?
I'm a-gonna get laid, Finch-fucker.

1097
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,880
And it's gonna be
oh, so good.

1098
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,800
It's gonna be like,
"You like this shit, Mama?"

1099
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,040
She's gonna be like,
"Fuckin' right, doggy, give it to me.

1100
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,640
Suck on my nipples
like you're milking a cow. "

1101
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,640
Like...

1102
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,220
You been here long?

1103
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,880
Oh, shit.

1104
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,960
Yeah.
Cadence,

1105
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,040
it is my distinct pleasure
to introduce you...

1106
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,400
- to the real Steve Stifler.
- Hi.

1107
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,160
Hi.

1108
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,280
Pumpkin.

1109
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,400
You are quite the gentleman, Stifler.

1110
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,280
You could have told me
she was behind me.

1111
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,320
Between Grandma and Stifler and Cadence.
The cake. The cake!

1112
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,120
I mean, are you kidding me? You know,
I thought I had grown out of this...

1113
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,840
sort of behaviour, but I keep messing up.

1114
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,760
These things keep happening to me.

1115
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,200
And if I can't bring it
together for one day,

1116
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,960
how am I gonna hold it together
for the rest of our lives?

1117
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,200
I'm really afraid that this is
how it's always gonna be.

1118
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,160
Yeah, but you always manage
to get yourself into serious shit,

1119
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,760
and somehow you always come out
of it better than you went in.

1120
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,880
I don't know how, but you do.
Everything is gonna be fine.

1121
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,720
Yeah. Um, uh, you need to
come into the kitchen right now.

1122
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,960
There's... Yeah.
Jesus, now what?

1123
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,440
There is no way to remake
all these in time, is there?

1124
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,680
Something must have
disrupted the power.

1125
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,040
The compressors need time to reset
after a power loss, or they overheat.

1126
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,000
Essentially, it turns the refrigerator
into an oven.

1127
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:00,280
Stifler was in here earlier
flipping switches.

1128
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,480
Michelle, I am so sorry.

1129
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,960
Hey!

1130
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,160
Ooh. Those flowers
look hideous.

1131
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,080
That's 'cause you killed them,
Stifler.

1132
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,840
You've ruined everything.

1133
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,080
F... What are you
talking about?

1134
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,520
You obviously don't care about this
wedding or anyone in it.

1135
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,720
Cadence.

1136
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,120
Jim?

1137
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,880
Shit-brick, come on.

1138
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,600
Maybe you should
just leave, Stifler.

1139
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,680
Fine. Adios.

1140
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,120
Fuckers, it's not my fault!

1141
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,840
I'm not an "intellectual Einstein".
I'm not...

1142
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,280
- Damn it.!

1143
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,840
Fuck!

1144
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,640
Hey, flower fuckers, you there?

1145
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,400
Zyskowski.

1146
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,680
Hello?

1147
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,800
Are you awake?

1148
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,880
Come on. Come on.
Anybody awake?

1149
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,120
Oh.!

1150
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,760
- Are you Miss Zyskowski?
- Who are you?

1151
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,520
I'm the guy who just killed all the flowers
for the Levenstein-band geek wedding.

1152
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,480
- What?
- Yeah, I'm that guy.

1153
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,560
Now what I need you to do is drag
your ass down to your little store,

1154
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,520
gather up some flowers,
slice 'em and dice 'em,

1155
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,160
jam 'em all together and cart that crap
down to the wedding.

1156
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,280
Are you completely insane?

1157
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,600
- You have no idea.
- Even if I overlook the fact...

1158
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,240
that this is the rudest thing
I have ever encountered,

1159
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,960
there is no time
to redo all that work.

1160
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,120
I had four assistants working two
full days on that wedding.

1161
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,040
I'm sorry.

1162
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,280
It's impossible.

1163
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,600
We don't quit at halftime, ma'am!

1164
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,640
You don't score
until you score!

1165
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,400
That's the spirit, sweetheart.

1166
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,840
Pick up the pace.

1167
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,840
You guys keep working this hard,
we'll be able to beat the Wildcats.

1168
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,440
You remember how tough
they were last year.

1169
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,680
Come on. Let's see
some determination.

1170
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,120
Determination.!

1171
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,120
Come on. Keep working.!

1172
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,600
Good, Connor. Very good.
Good, DeBoer.

1173
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,600
Really sucks.
Go fix it.

1174
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,440
Hey, party guy. Having a good time,
huh? Can I get you a gin and tonic?

1175
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,880
Ring! Hold on a second.
Hello. Okay.

1176
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,040
It's for you.
It's "get to work, fucker. "

1177
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,200
We are gathered here today
to join these two great people...

1178
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,520
in a blessed union and bladdah,
bladdah, bladdah and crap.

1179
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,120
Coach, this is kinda gay.

1180
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,200
Yeah, it is.

1181
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,960
Good work.
Hey, no problem.

1182
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,880
So, you got a date
for this thing?

1183
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,800
Don't push it.
Sorry.

1184
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,680
Holy shit.

1185
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,760
How the hell did this happen?

1186
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,800
It's a miracle.

1187
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,800
Stifler. Save it, dickhead.
I'm working.

1188
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,960
- You're an asshole.
- I know.

1189
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,120
You really are an asshole.

1190
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,720
Thanks.

1191
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,400
I don't do apologies so good.

1192
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,120
Well, you get an "A" for effort.
This is amazing.

1193
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,280
Cool.

1194
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,920
I was always kind of
a "C" student.

1195
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,440
So, did you do all this
just to have sex with me...

1196
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,720
or because you really care
about the wedding?

1197
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,920
Both.

1198
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,000
And, uh...

1199
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,920
I like you.

1200
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,600
What?

1201
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,120
I like you.

1202
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,560
Well, that's an honest answer.

1203
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,520
I gotta go.

1204
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,600
Steve Stifler just gave
a rose to a girl and meant it.

1205
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:14,320
This is huge. It's... It's like watching
monkeys use tools for the first time.

1206
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,320
You still pissed
about me and Cadence?

1207
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,240
No. Let's see.

1208
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,520
She wasn't into the heavy intellectual
stuff.

1209
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,200
She actually liked me
being that imbecile.

1210
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,240
No, no, somehow I think
she's probably better off with you.

1211
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,240
Thanks, shit-brick.

1212
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:36,000
Ooh. Dick.
Fucking hate not hating you.

1213
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,360
I did fuck your mom.

1214
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,600
Twice.

1215
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,480
Ooh! That's better, fucker!

1216
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,320
Oh. Whoa!
Ready to go?

1217
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,960
Um, the wedding's
not for another hour.

1218
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,000
No, I mean you and me.

1219
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,040
Hold on. Hold on.

1220
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,160
Do I still gotta do
this bullshit meeting?

1221
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,280
Stifler, you are not
bailing on Jim.

1222
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,000
Shit!
Give me 10 minutes?

1223
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,960
I'll meet you at the closet.
The closet.

1224
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,800
You wanted to see me,
Michelle?

1225
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,240
Oh! Okay, sit.

1226
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,080
So, uh, Jim said that you've always
kind of been there for him...

1227
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:35,160
when he needed you, so I thought
maybe you could help me.

1228
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,520
Jim said that?

1229
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,800
What's, uh...
What's the problem?

1230
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,680
Okay. Well, I, uh...

1231
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,640
I still can't get
my vows right.

1232
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,440
Oh. I haven't been this confused
since I got my first period.

1233
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,880
That's a very confusing time
for any young lady.

1234
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,680
You know, your body
is going through, uh, changes.

1235
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,840
Um, stuff coming out,
stuff going in.

1236
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,880
Oh, no. I need help with my vows,
not my period.

1237
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,040
Oh, your vows.
Your vows.

1238
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,800
Yes, uh, good.
Um, go on.

1239
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,360
Jim just wants a groomsmen's meeting
before the wedding.

1240
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:20,080
It shouldn't take long.
Just don't let her talk to anyone.

1241
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,360
Be careful.
She's feisty.

1242
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,880
Okay, let's go.

1243
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,520
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming out
here and meeting me.

1244
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,520
I, um... I just have a couple of things
I wanna say.

1245
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,440
This sucks.

1246
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,160
Did I say that out loud?

1247
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,200
Keep going.
It's good.

1248
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,880
Now, I thought about
what you said, Kev.

1249
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
About, uh, about how my problems
always seem to work out.

1250
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:57,360
And I realized that the reason
things always work out...

1251
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,400
is because you guys have always
been there to back me up.

1252
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,320
Even you, Stifler.

1253
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,480
For the first time in my life...

1254
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,120
I actually feel like
I can't mess anything up.

1255
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,040
Which is pretty amazing.

1256
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,320
So, uh,

1257
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:24,480
I- I guess I just wanted
to say thank you.

1258
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,520
Thanks. Yeah.
Thanks?

1259
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,840
This whole thing
was about thanks?

1260
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,160
Ooh! You're welcome,
cock-block!

1261
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,680
That was good, Jim.
Real nice.

1262
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,920
Let's get you married.
Hmm?

1263
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,080
Okay.

1264
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,560
Love is very difficult
to describe.

1265
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,400
And I understand the angst.
I mean, it's your wedding.

1266
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,200
And it's natural.
It's perfectly natural.

1267
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,160
But it's impossible
to describe a feeling.

1268
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,320
Okay, first,
nothing is impossible.

1269
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,840
So, let's not focus
on that.

1270
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:07,280
Why do you think, Michelle,
they call it "making love"?

1271
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,280
I don't know.
I just call it "boneing. "

1272
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,960
Boneing.

1273
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,200
Well, when you're doing
other things with Jim...

1274
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,720
when you're not,
um, boneing...

1275
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,680
how does
he make you feel?

1276
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,040
Horny, like I wanna bone.

1277
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,880
But we can't be boneing
from sunrise to sunset, dear.

1278
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,840
Oh, you've never tried it?

1279
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,760
I certainly have.
I have. I've boned.

1280
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,400
From sunrise right through brunch,
on more than one occasion.

1281
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:43,120
But boneing aside, um, I think they call it
"making love"...

1282
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,400
because you have to
make love work.

1283
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,640
You know,
it's about compromise and sacrifice.

1284
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,920
And I think Jim
has sacrificed for you.

1285
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,160
My God, he shaved
his entire pubic region,

1286
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,120
which would baffle most
cultures around the world.

1287
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:03,000
But he did it,
and he did it for you.

1288
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:08,040
You're right.
Love isn't just a feeling.

1289
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,080
It's shaving your balls.

1290
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,720
Thanks, Dad.

1291
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,680
I wouldn't get into too much detail
on that.

1292
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,920
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

1293
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,840
Oh, yeah, excuse me.
Pardon me. Pardon me.

1294
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,560
Gonna have sex with Cadence
Uh-huh.

1295
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,680
You know, son, I think this is probably
the right time to tell you that...

1296
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:42,560
that...
I know, Dad.

1297
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,840
I can't see anything here.

1298
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,120
Oh, there you are.

1299
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,760
Guys, what are you doing?
Where's Jim's grandma?

1300
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,080
The old bitch sucked.
We had to ditch her.

1301
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,160
You what?
Don't worry.

1302
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,400
We put her someplace
no one will find her.

1303
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,320
Cadence, where are you going?
Oh, Mom.

1304
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:20,480
Oh, baby.
I'm so ready for this.

1305
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,520
Your body's not quite what I was
expecting, but that's okay.

1306
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,600
The Stif-man digs
what's underneath.

1307
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:35,680
Oh, you are so beautiful.
Oh, I just wanna...

1308
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,760
Stifler.! Granny.!

1309
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,920
Granny? What?
Focus! Focus! Focus!

1310
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,920
Out...
It's not what it looks like!

1311
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,000
- Shut the fucking door!

1312
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,040
You got it, champ.

1313
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,800
You're a hero.

1314
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,200
Hey, pussy's pussy.

1315
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:23,440
Look at the smile
on my mother's face.

1316
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,320
Do you know how long she's been
waiting for a day like this?

1317
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,640
I can't imagine.

1318
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,760
I couldn't be happier.
Thank you.

1319
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,080
Don't.

1320
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,720
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.

1321
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,440
What made Grandma
come around?

1322
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,600
Finch said Stifler
talked to her.

1323
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,200
Stifler?

1324
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,040
Grandmother fucker.

1325
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,600
You're a motherfucker.

1326
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,840
Yes, I am.
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1327
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:12,280
And I promise to love you
for as long as I shall live.

1328
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,120
Michelle, you are the one woman
I want to be with...

1329
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,800
and the woman
I can't be without.

1330
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,800
I love you.

1331
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,640
I love you.

1332
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,680
Jim,

1333
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,680
I had trouble finding the words
to tell you how I feel.

1334
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,920
And I realized something.

1335
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,920
Love isn't just a feeling.

1336
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,840
Love is something you do.

1337
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:55,440
It's a dress,
a visit to band camp.

1338
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,640
A special haircut.

1339
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,520
Jim, you've given me
everything I've ever wanted.

1340
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,000
And it is my solemn vow...

1341
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,640
to give everything I am to you.

1342
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,600
James Emanuel Levenstein...

1343
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,520
and Michelle Anabeth Flaherty,

1344
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,480
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

1345
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,960
You may kiss the bride.

1346
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:52,240
Let's all welcome Mr. And Mrs. Jim and
Michelle Levenstein onto the dance floor.

1347
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,960
Just follow my lead.
I'll try.

1348
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,120
I taught him that.

1349
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,880
Jim, you learned to dance.

1350
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,600
Well, seems like everything worked out.
Magnificently.

1351
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:17,360
I feel a bit sad that tonight our little
Michelle is going to be a woman.

1352
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,000
Honey, you don't honestly believe
that Michelle is still a...

1353
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:24,560
Well, I'll tell you, Mary. I can't recall a
single moment with either one of them...

1354
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,800
that would make me
think otherwise.

1355
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,600
Thank you. See?

1356
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,440
Whew! Whoa!

1357
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,160
Hey, tough guy.

1358
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,480
Stifler's mom.

1359
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,360
Well, we meet again.

1360
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,200
I was curious.
Didn't see you here.

1361
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,680
I try to keep a low profile.

1362
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,480
I never really did
like these things anyway.

1363
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,720
You know, this has actually
made quite an impression on me.

1364
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,560
I have something to look for
in a woman now.

1365
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,840
Well, if this is your idea
of a proposal...

1366
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,000
Finchy, you gotta know
that I'm over you now.

1367
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,400
And I'm over you.

1368
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,880
But as they say,
we will always have Paris.

1369
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,160
And the pool table.
And the car.

1370
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:17,520
And the two-room suite
I have upstairs. Come here.

1371
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Turned out better
than I ever imagined.

1372
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,680
How did a little perv like you
turn into such a great guy?

1373
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,040
How did a little nympho like you
turn into such a great girl?

1374
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,920
I'm still a nympho.
Oh, I'm still a perv.

1375
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,120
I know.
What's wrong with us?

1376
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,640
You know, Michelle,

1377
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,040
to quote someone
I've learned quite a bit from,

1378
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,440
"I think you and I...

1379
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:08,480
are a perfectly natural,
normal thing. "

1380
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,840
Perfectly natural.

1381
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,840
That's her.
Holy shit, dude.

1382
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,000
I told you this wedding
would be worth it.

1383
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:37,760
Oh, my goddess.
My queen. My MILF. Oh.

1384
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,800
MILF. MILF.
MILF. MILF.

1385
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,720
MILF. MILF.

1386
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,800
No way, bro!

1387
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,240
Hey, you're not finished yet,
are you, Finchy?

1388
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,280
No, ma'am.
Just getting started.

1389
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,760
This guy is the fucking master.

1390
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,520
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Make it stop. Make it stop.

1391
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,760
Make it stop.

1392
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,920
Oh, Stifler's mom.
