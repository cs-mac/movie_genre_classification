1
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,269
Reesa from Manhattan,
you're on the air.

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,000
I date a lot of guys.
I mean, a lot.

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,038
I've had more blind dates than
a seeing eye dog. You know why?

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,317
- I'm on tenterhooks, shoot.
- I'm looking for the real thing.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,630
...you're talking about,
but I wanna feel love.

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,236
The kind where you're so delirious
you can barely breathe or eat.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,915
I'm waiting for Prince Charming who
will pick me up, sweep me off my feet...

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,868
- Slam me into a wall, and bang my...
- Let me stop you right there, Reesa.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,918
First, I don't think love
is supposed to deny you of your food.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,709
...or oxygen supply.
Love is supposed to nourish you.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,269
Well, I'm just saying
I want the fairy tale.

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,795
I want the excitement, the romance,
you know?

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,748
Yeah, I do. This Prince Charming
of yours doesn't exist.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,797
He's good for a few nights in the sack...

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,554
...but his charm will run thin,
which is what charm does.

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,315
Well, I hear ya, Dr Lloyd, but what
I'm saying is that I want to be deeply.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,790
- And passionately in love.
- You want to be passionately in love.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,635
I see. You know who's a bigger flake
than your buddy, Prince Charming?

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,076
His brother, Prince Passion.
Reesa, if you are truly serious.

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,959
...about wanting to find real
and lasting love in this town...

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,350
I'm gonna have to dish out
tough love to you now.

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,476
- Uh-oh.
- This serial dating of yours.

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,110
...is a waste of time. You can't
find something when you don't know

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,113
what you're looking for.
You're playing the field, right?

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,149
Hoping that somebody will want you,
when it's you who needs to figure out.

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,357
what it is you want.
Anybody can fall in love...

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,638
...but what you deserve is a man with
the emotional maturity to stay in love.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,112
Don't settle for a boyfriend
when you can demand a manfriend.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,111
I'm not really the demanding type.

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,032
Don't go there, Reesa.

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,952
Hear what she's doing, listeners?

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,795
That is the sound of a woman
who settles for second-best.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,430
Why do we do that? I mean,
deep down we know we deserve better...

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,512
...so why do we keep lowering
our standards?

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,399
I devote a chapter
to this in my new book, Real Love...

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,959
which come to stores on Wednesday.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,716
I've finally learned that unless
you demand real love for yourself...

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,996
...you're going to get
seriously hurt out there.

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,628
But how am I supposed to know
if love is real or not?

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,759
Spell it out for yourselves.
Is he responsible?

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,754
Is he your equal?

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,674
Is he an adult?
- Are you freakin' blind?

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,276
- And most of all, L: Is he loving?
- That's a ridiculous call!

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,672
- Know anybody like that?
- Not really.

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,469
Hold out for it, Reesa.
You'll be so glad you did.

46
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,677
Oh, Dr Lloyd, you are such a lifesaver.
Thank you so much.

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,876
You're welcome.
All right, next caller.

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,600
- Patrick! Come on!
- Where'd she go?

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,390
Hopefully, she went to buy you a muzzle.
Keep your mouth quiet next time.

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,120
- Move it, move it.
- If there is a next time.

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,636
Showtunes.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,712
Showtunes.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,871
- More showtunes.
- I like showtunes!

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,157
- Obviously. It's sad.
- Oh, there's the love doctor.

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,390
- I hate that lady.
- My lady loves this.

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,312
- Mine, too.
- Your... Your who?

57
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,755
I mean my mother.

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,354
- What is that?
- You're a beast.

59
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,559
Next caller.
Sofia of Astoria, you're on the air.

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,917
- Hi. Hi, am I on?
- Yeah. Yeah, here we are. Let's go.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,790
I'm supposed to be getting married this
weekend, and I'm having second thoughts.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,635
- Second, third, fourth?
- What do you mean?

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,836
Thinking about calling
this off a while?

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,073
Well, I took your online compatibility
test, and I scored a 12.

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,596
OK. That test helps predict
long-term compatibility, caller.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,149
- You're right to consider this...
- Sofia?

67
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,276
...very, very carefully.

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,796
Forty-three per cent
of marriages end in divorce.

69
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,032
All right? You don't want that.
How long have you known this guy?

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,078
About five months, but he's
a really good guy and all, and...

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,629
But... But... Five months?

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,918
Sofia, are you scared of being alone?

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,231
- I guess so, maybe, yeah.
- 'Cause you know what's scarier.

74
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,960
...than being alone?
You know what's worse?

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,511
Being alone with the wrong guy
for the rest of your life. You got it?

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,989
Doesn't sound like
an average case of jitters.

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,799
Wait, are you saying
I should call off the wedding?

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,795
I'm running out of time, caller,
but you know, deep inside...

79
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,555
what you need to do.
Thank you for calling.

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,278
Good luck.

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,233
Knock-knock.

82
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,039
- Mm, who's there?
- This is your publisher speaking.

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,149
- Mm, we don't want any.
- Read 'em and weep.

84
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,154
- Oh, really?
- There's only one way to find out.

85
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,959
No, no. I'm too nervous.
You read it.

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,510
"The doctor is in.

87
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,309
The first book from local talk radio
sensation Dr Emma Lloyd, Real Love...

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,029
...establishes Lloyd as the latest
khoja of modern romance."

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,317
- Latest what? What did they call me?
- Khoja, apparently.

90
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,472
I don't know what that means.
I don't know how to spell it.

91
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,029
- K-H...
- What kind of word is khoja?

92
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,668
...O...
- It's just showing off, really.

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,559
- OK.
- For a popular magazine.

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,349
...to review a self-help book
and pull out a word like "khoja"...

95
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,752
"from the Turkish 'hoca':
A, a title of respect for teacher.

96
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,798
- B, a wise man."
- Or woman.

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,394
Oh! Or "C, a sub-sect.

98
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,314
...of ancient Ismaili assassins." Hm.

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,869
- Lets go with A, for teacher.
- I don't know.

100
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,759
The assassin thing,
I wouldn't throw that out.

101
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,229
- I love New York Magazine.
- Geniuses.

102
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,312
- Should I write a thank-you note?
- Send a fruit basket.

103
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,914
Mm. I love fruit.

104
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,753
Yeah, well, that's
why I'm marrying you, my khoja.

105
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,516
We're not done.
We're not done with comments...

106
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,477
- Ah.
- OK.

107
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,631
OK. Let's see.

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,349
"Dr Lloyd's analysis of love's
dos and don'ts is both insightful.

109
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,159
- And trenchant."
- Trenchant! What does that mean?

110
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,232
Is that some kind of fancy word
for "full of shit?" Trenchant?

111
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,039
- Direct and incisive.
- Gimme a break, smart-ass...

112
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,191
What? I saw it on Jeopardy.

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,636
Why didn't they just say,
"Read the book, ruin your life?"

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,518
Read the sports page to us, huh?

115
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,672
"Physical gifts can offer
such insightful observations.

116
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,434
...into the human heart
is a thing of wonder."

117
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,070
- Whoa. Trouble, one o'clock.
- "She is chicken soup for the heart."

118
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,958
Oh, my ass!

119
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,352
- Hey! Hey, Sofia! Sof!
- Uh-oh. Here we go.

120
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,876
I'm reading about that lady that helped
you plunge a knife through my heart.

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,873
- Very trenchant stuff.
- I can't talk right now...

122
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,679
- Because I gotta be someplace.
- We'll give you a ride.

123
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,150
Hey, fellas! Stop the truck!

124
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,596
Sof, come on.
You haven't returned any of my calls.

125
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,548
- Well, I've been busy.
- Sofia, give the guy a break.

126
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,553
Talk to him, Sof.

127
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,872
Oh, don't do that, Sof!
Come out here! Sofia!

128
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,750
Please come out here
so that we can talk.

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,151
No, no, no, not you, sir.
You can put your hands down.

130
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,272
- Firemen. We don't arrest people.
- We'll hose you down.

131
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,468
Sof! I'm not gonna go anywhere
until you come out here.

132
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,955
I don't understand. You know,
one minute we're gettin' married...

133
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,829
...talkin' about names for our kids,
and the next, because some fruitcake...

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,673
- She's a doctor.
- Of what, Sof?

135
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,638
Of what? Talk to me, here.

136
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,995
Patrick, it's over.

137
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,798
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,678
OK? It's over.

139
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,438
I gotta go.

140
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,548
All right, show's over, folks! Let's
keep it movin'! What are ya lookin' at?

141
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,949
I met someone I like, but all
my friends tell me he's wrong for me.

142
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,759
- What do your friends say?
- We have nothing in common.

143
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,909
It's just the sex.

144
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,834
I'm just running away from many more
appropriate men who pursue me.

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,991
- Because...
- Afraid of the real thing?

146
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,149
So they say.

147
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,230
- There's Patrick!
- Oh, Patrick!

148
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,034
- Patrick...
- Quiet! Leave the man alone.

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,668
Can you not see
that his heart is broken?

150
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,159
How can he eat when the woman
that he loved abandoned him forever...

151
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,313
...virtually without explanation
and may be, at this very moment...

152
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,836
...cuckolding him with some other man.

153
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,834
- Good night, everybody.
- Cuckolding? What's that mean?

154
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,394
- Hey.
- I'll be right with you.

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,836
I'm giving Ann Coulter's
frequent flyer miles to Michael Moore.

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,639
Ajay, come on, man.
This hacking's getting out of hand.

157
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,679
- You can get into serious trouble.
- Too late. Bon voyage, Mr. Moore.

158
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,990
See the clipping
on love doctor's wedding?

159
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,276
Who in their right mind
is gonna marry her?

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,193
- Whoever we want.
- What do you mean?

161
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,316
Check this out.

162
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,192
- Who's that?
- That's her.

163
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,397
- The love doctor?
- I got it off her birth certificate.

164
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,633
- Oh, I don't know about this, Ajay.
- What are you talking about?

165
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,429
All you ever do is walk around muttering
about giving her a piece of your mind.

166
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,955
...or letting her have it
or fixing her wagon.

167
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,429
OK, for one, I've never said,
"Fix her wagon."

168
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,114
If you've moved on, that's different...

169
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,919
...and I'm happy you
finally put this behind you.

170
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,638
Wait, whoa.

171
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,872
Maybe me tellin' her how I feel
and holdin' her accountable would be...

172
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,271
...you know, important for my growth
or whatever. What do you think?

173
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,672
What am I, your yogi? I thought
you just wanted a little payback.

174
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,674
- Let's do it.
- Nice.

175
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,033
Oh, no.

176
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,111
Now you're married.

177
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,713
I'm married.

178
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,475
- I'm what?
- Already married.

179
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,995
- According to who?
- "According to whom."

180
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,276
- The state of New York.
- That's impossible.

181
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,070
- I have never been married.
- You must have the wrong Emma Lloyd.

182
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,233
Emmaline Willing Lloyd?

183
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,152
Your real name is Emmaline?

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,231
A lot of things
you don't know about her.

185
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,279
- How do we fix this?
- Annulment forms. Fill them out.

186
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,590
Have them notarized. Bring them back.

187
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,711
- I can't believe I didn't know.
- Your husband needs to sign them.

188
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,552
- Fiancé.
- Husband.

189
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,349
- I don't have a husband.
- Then who is Patrick Thomas Sullivan.

190
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,272
- Of Astoria, New York?
- Who is he?

191
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,670
- I don't know.
- He's your husband.

192
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,593
His address is right there.

193
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,159
- Astoria?
- Queens.

194
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,470
I know a lawyer
who can sort this out quietly.

195
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,996
- I'm sure that won't be necessary.
- It will. I've got a book to launch.

196
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,354
Yours, I might add.

197
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,988
- You don't think I was married.
- No. It's not that.

198
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,549
It's just the timing
of this could not be worse.

199
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,280
- I know.
- I'm recalling 70,000 copies.

200
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,034
...of a moving memoir
by a new author that we've trumpeted.

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,715
...as the next Maya Angelou who turns out
to have plagiarized... Guess who?

202
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,110
...Maya Angelou.
- I forgot about that one.

203
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,840
I didn't. The headline
"Love Doctor: A polygamist"

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,515
- Just flashed before my eyes.
- Hold these.

205
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,989
On top of everything,
Bollenbecker take-over.

206
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,391
They haven't announced which publishers
they'll keep and dump.

207
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,233
So one self-help author
who can't seem to help herself.

208
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,358
...from being married,
Abdington Books could be history.

209
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,717
I understand completely. Trust me.
I'll take care of it.

210
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,635
Everything will be fine...
Oh, no, darling. Naughty choc-y.

211
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,873
- You don't need this.
- You're right. Moment of weakness.

212
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,468
- Go get 'em.
- Taxi! Bye, sweetie.

213
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,351
Hello?

214
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,358
Hello?

215
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,910
Hello? Excuse me?

216
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,548
You're not Patrick Sullivan, are you?

217
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,349
- You are? No.
- May I help you?

218
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,752
- I hope so. Is this 230133rd Street?
- Yes. It is.

219
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,549
I'm looking for someone who lives here
by the unlikely name, Patrick Sullivan.

220
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,349
Patrick.

221
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,956
Keep going, tall lady! Keep going!

222
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,352
Excuse me?

223
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,354
Excuse me, sir? Officer?

224
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,557
Hello!

225
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,518
Hey. Hey, I'm sorry...

226
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,117
No, no, no! That's fine. Um, can you
tell me how I can find Patrick Sullivan?

227
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,758
- We couldn't get that lady out.
- She weighed 500 pounds!

228
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,712
- She knocked you with her skillet.
- Frying pan.

229
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,632
- Patrick?
- Yeah. Ah!

230
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,075
You won't believe this.
That home-wrecking lady.

231
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,798
...from the radio walked in here.

232
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,757
- I believe you.
- Can I help you?

233
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,388
- What's she doin'?
- Looking for Patrick Sullivan.

234
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,358
- I was told he might be here.
- Right over there.

235
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,511
- She looked over.
- What are you havin'?

236
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,717
- Um, whatever he's having.
- I'll bring it right over.

237
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,916
It's walkin' right this way.

238
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,469
- It's takin' its coat off.
- How do you do?

239
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,110
It just looked at me again.
It's comin' over here.

240
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,192
It's comin' right for me.
What does it want?

241
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,193
Patrick Sullivan?
You're not an easy man to find.

242
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,989
- I'm Emma Lloyd.
- It thinks I'm you. Help me out.

243
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,072
Hey, I, uh... I dropped my chalk.
I'm Patrick Sullivan.

244
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,074
- This is my opponent, Larry Berlson.
- Oh! Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Berlson.

245
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,515
How do you do?
I'm here for the oddest reason.

246
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,272
- We all are.
- Here you are.

247
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,237
- Mine?
- Mind if I interrupt?

248
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,311
- Knock yourself out.
- I didn't mean...

249
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,629
- Don't play?
- Yes.

250
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,030
Then you're stripes.
Down the hatch.

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,318
- No, no, Mr. Sullivan. I'm here to...
- You don't drink? You don't play pool?

252
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,871
Perhaps I can get you an herbal tea?

253
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,232
Nine in the corner.

254
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,991
We need another round.

255
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,879
Mr. Sullivan. Something
very unfortunate has happened...

256
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,952
- And it could make a mess of my life.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

257
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,475
- It's certainly not your fault.
- It's your shot.

258
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,677
Um, all right.
Well, how can I explain?

259
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,389
You see, um, uh,
I'm about to be married.

260
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,437
That is too bad!

261
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,831
Congratulations on the other thing.
We got a bride in our midst.

262
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,470
Thank you. That won't be necessary.

263
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,110
It's necessary. I feel a toast
coming on. Wait a second.

264
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,350
- I know you.
- Excuse me?

265
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,114
Yeah, yeah.
Real Love With Dr Emma Lloyd.

266
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,114
- You're that lady I hear on the radio.
- Yes, of course. You found me out.

267
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,670
- Have you ever been on television?
- Um, no, but I have a book coming out.

268
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,912
- I love television.
- My girlfriend never misses your show.

269
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,548
Oh, well, has it been
helpful in your relationship?

270
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,679
Oh, you have no idea.
It's completely changed our lives!

271
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,389
- Oh, really? That is so nice to hear.
- Yeah. Tony! Here you go.

272
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,233
- To the bride and ever-changing life!
- To the bride!

273
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,039
To the bride!

274
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,034
Mr. Sullivan, as I was saying,
you see, I'm about to be married.

275
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,556
Be careful. Forty-three per cent
of marriages end in divorce.

276
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,598
That's right. It's all
about picking the right partner.

277
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,718
- So true. It's so true.
- In order to do that, my fiancé...

278
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,110
Richard, and I,
need a license from New York...

279
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,319
- Richard from dispatch? Asshole.
- So on an otherwise lovely morning...

280
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,675
- we go to city hall...
- To Emma and Richie!

281
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,832
Richard!

282
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,594
- And I don't want any more.
- Hey, you're right.

283
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,593
Don't want Richie to see
you hammered before your wedding.

284
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,796
Tony! Give me
that herbal tea over here.

285
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,758
Herbal tea, coming up!

286
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,516
Very funny, Mr. Sullivan. Very funny.

287
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,069
- I'll have you know I don't get drunk.
- You don't?

288
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,277
No. My father taught me a good trick
to hold one's liquor.

289
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,034
You simply recite
the presidents' names in order.

290
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,760
- Out loud?
- Forwards or backwards?

291
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,310
Watch and learn, gentlemen.
To Washington, Adams, Jefferson...

292
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,277
Madison and Monroe.

293
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,351
- Carter!
- Carter!

294
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,637
- Reagan!
- Reagan!

295
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,552
- Bush!
- Bush!

296
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,393
Do you think maybe we
should pour you into a cab?

297
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,994
- Maybe your fiancé's worried.
- Oh! That's right!

298
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,549
That is exactly what
I came to talk to you about.

299
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,631
- OK.
- Yes, Mr. Sullivan...

300
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,075
- it seems we're married.
- Come again?

301
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,028
We... Are married!

302
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,714
- I thought you were marrying Richie.
- Exactly!

303
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,279
- I'm over here.
- Right!

304
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,718
Uh, yes, it seems that we,
I mean we...

305
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,077
...are victims of a glitch in some
computer, somewhere, somehow...

306
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,800
I don't know, has married us.

307
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,350
- A glitch?
- Mm-hm. I'll say. A big one.

308
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,038
- Oh, boy.
- So, um, if, um, you'd just be...

309
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,158
...so kind as
to sign these papers I'd...

310
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,870
Ow!

311
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,353
Washington, Madison, Adamson...

312
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,353
- Are you a fireman?
- Indeed, I am.

313
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,988
I always liked you guys.

314
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,155
Lights are out now.

315
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,400
Sorry about that.

316
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,357
Oh! Ouch!

317
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,992
Hello? Oh, no!

318
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,799
Oh, no! Oh, no!

319
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,028
Oh, my God!

320
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,714
Oh, my God!

321
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,393
Oh!

322
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,151
Oh, my God.

323
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,789
Oh!

324
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,389
Excuse me.

325
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,832
- Good morning, Dr Lloyd.
- Good morning. Wait!

326
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,036
- Someone had a rough night.
- Oh, yeah.

327
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,156
Excuse me.

328
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,391
- Oh, my.
- I need the emergency outfit.

329
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,118
- What?
- The emergency outfit!

330
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,918
Outfit I keep for emergencies.

331
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,799
Richard called six and a half times.
Last time he hung up.

332
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,713
He was looking desperate.
Worried about Bollenbeckers?

333
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,757
- Can you get him for me?
- On the phone?

334
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,672
- Why do you do that?
- It's fun.

335
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,354
- The outfit?
- Not here.

336
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,669
- I had a date.
- Oh!

337
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,990
You know we're not remotely
the same size?

338
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,357
- Richard. Aspirin. Coffee.
- Oh, and your father's...

339
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,195
- Now!
- Please hold. Richard, line one!

340
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,159
Richard, sweetheart.
I am so sorry I didn't call.

341
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,029
I was in Queens so I thought I'd stay at
my father's and go over wedding stuff.

342
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,839
- Why didn't you call?
- He brought you in this morning.

343
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,434
- with your mom's dress.
- He brought me back in.

344
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,273
- with my mom's wedding dress.
- And your father's here.

345
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,431
- She knows it.
- What about Sullivan?

346
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,919
- It's beautiful.
- Emma?

347
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,992
- Yes! I found Sullivan.
- Coffee, Wilder?

348
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,479
- I'd love some.
- Aspirin?

349
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,471
- I've got the papers.
- Welcome.

350
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,153
Not on me.

351
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,992
- Coffee filters?
- I don't work here.

352
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,754
I know they have to be notarized.
Can you get that?

353
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,399
- Sure.
- Don't worry.

354
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,190
You have enough on your plate without
having to worry about this. Don't...

355
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,920
Emma, your husband would
like a few words with you.

356
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,877
- Who?
- Patrick Sullivan?

357
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,554
...have them on you?
- Sweetheart, can you, um?...

358
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,473
Can you hold please? Not a word.

359
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,677
Hello? You there? Hello?

360
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,910
- Ah! Mr. Sullivan?
- Hey.

361
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,516
Let me get to the point. I left some
very important documents in your...

362
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,353
- Richard! Phone!
- Uh, can you just hold on.

363
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,909
- One second? Don't go away.
- Yeah.

364
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,716
Richard, sweetheart,
I am so sorry to keep you holding.

365
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,474
- What's going on?
- I'll explain at the cake tasting.

366
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,553
- I can't. I'll meet you tonight.
- But you promised. All right.

367
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,554
Husband! Cell!

368
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,395
Oh! Mr. Sullivan? Mr. Sullivan!

369
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,551
- Wilder, here.
- Mr. Sullivan? Hello?

370
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,598
- Your father on two.
- Gotta run, darling! See you later.

371
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,877
- Gonna wait for your coffee?
- Nobody's got that kind of time.

372
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,759
I don't know what
you're smirking about, Wilder.

373
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,070
I'm just glad
to see you're having some fun.

374
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,073
Does it look like I'm having fun?
Wait.

375
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,915
You drove all the way in
just to bring Mom's dress?

376
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,231
Actually, I was hoping
to lure you over to Bemelmans.

377
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,439
- For a banana split like the old days.
- Bemelmans has been closed for years.

378
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,512
Ah, well, my timing's
always been a little off.

379
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,319
Don't keep your husbands waiting.

380
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,153
- It's not what you think.
- I know.

381
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,357
Mr. Sullivan?
Thank you so much for calling back.

382
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,317
- Excuse me?
- What do you want?

383
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,040
- Car's downstairs. You're late.
- Mr. Sullivan.

384
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,236
- Yes.
- Yes, about last night.

385
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,958
- Yeah.
- What exactly happened?

386
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,874
I tell you this, you do one hell
of a Riverdance. It was quite a night.

387
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,759
- That doesn't sound like me.
- That wasn't the good part.

388
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,399
- What do you mean?
- I'm here.

389
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,189
You're where?
Hey, I'm losing you. Hello?

390
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,999
Can you hear me now?
Look, forget last night.

391
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,118
What I want is a rather large stack
of papers I need you to sign.

392
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,238
- I got 'em right here.
- You do! Thanks. You made my day.

393
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,755
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

394
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,718
- I know a notary not far from here.
- Right now?

395
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,110
This appointment
took me three months to get.

396
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,111
- Sounds important.
- Cake tasting.

397
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,919
- Like I said, important stuff.
- It's the wedding cake...

398
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,878
...and she's Marilyn Hirschfield,
a respected cake maker.

399
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,395
- These appointments are hard...
- I love cake!

400
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,596
- What are you doing? Hey!
- Scoot over.

401
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,992
- This cake is fantastic!
- Shh! Please, please. Be quiet.

402
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,835
- Can I get another slice of this one?
- You've already tried the butter cream.

403
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,117
It's my fiancée. She's on the fence
about the butter cream.

404
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,838
- I am not.
- Have any milk?

405
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,956
- Sure.
- After this, we go to the notary?

406
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,476
- Yeah, absolutely. How much is this?
- It's free, sir.

407
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,871
Bullshit! It's free!

408
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,077
- Here you are, sir.
- Here's my milk.

409
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,915
- Would you like a sip?
- No, thank you. I'm not six.

410
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,310
Holy crap! Cake down.

411
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,313
I need a spoon. Don't worry about it.
I got this.

412
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,029
Here we have our dark Belgian chocolate
with vanilla mousse torte.

413
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,031
- Thank you.
- It's awesome.

414
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,478
Oh, my God! Do you know
if you mix these two together...

415
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,915
...it tastes like a Ring Ding!
You gotta try this.

416
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,039
No, no, no. That's all right.
I'm not your baby. No, no, no, no, no!

417
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,111
- Ah! Ah!
- No!

418
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,713
- Mmm?
- Ah?

419
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,078
- Mm. It's yummy.
- It's super-duper.

420
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,916
Mm-hm. Um, may I, um... May I just
have one more glass of milk, please?

421
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,878
Attagirl! Milk for my bride.
In fact, milks all around.

422
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,712
Milks all around.

423
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,678
- Hey, where you ladies from?
- Germany.

424
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,751
Wow! You must really like cake.

425
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,718
Yeah, you gotta try this,
and mix these two together.

426
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,395
Hey, hey, can we get, uh, some
Ring Ding things for the gals over here?

427
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,028
Darling, I am certain
everyone is being attended to.

428
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,078
Baby, I got this covered.
Don't you worry about it.

429
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,152
- Quite a handful you got there.
- That he is.

430
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,233
Impulsive, unpredictable. You never
know what he's gonna do next.

431
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,437
- Full of surprises.
- But that's the fun of it, isn't it?

432
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,797
- Of course it is.
- It is, trust me.

433
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,633
- Here you go, ladies.
- He reminds me of my husband.

434
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,031
when we first met. Everybody
thought we were a total mismatch...

435
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,990
...but we had so much fun.
And we still do 25 years later.

436
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,799
Hey! What are you ladies
talkin' about over here?

437
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,315
- Talking about the men in our lives.
- Ah, boys.

438
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,631
- Never mind.
- How did you two meet?

439
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,516
Oh, honey, you tell the story.
You tell it a lot better than I do.

440
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,312
No, no, no, no, no. No, you tell it.
You're the good, uh, teller of it.

441
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,675
- Please?
- All right, all right. Sure.

442
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,549
- You ladies heard of pro wrestling?
- Stop! Kidder!

443
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,597
Oh, he's such a kidder. Kidder.

444
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,752
It was a, um, uh... A blind date.

445
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,354
- Oh?
- Yeah, yeah, we were fixed up.

446
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,875
Yes! Fixed up.
But not with each other.

447
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,191
It was two separate blind dates
in the same bar.

448
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,191
- Both goin' terribly.
- Horribly!

449
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,430
Think about those people who set us up.

450
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,636
- Susie and Allen.
- Susie and Allen.

451
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,713
- What the hell did they know?
- I don't know. I guess he noticed me.

452
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,997
Well, I mean, come on. Look at her.

453
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,154
- A guy would have to be blind.
- Noticed me suffering on my bad date...

454
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,472
...and then the band started playing this
song, and it was my favorite song.

455
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,794
And suddenly he was next to me and
he asked me to dance, and... I said yes.

456
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,276
- What was the song?
- Song?

457
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,273
- Mm-hm?
- Oh, yeah, the song.

458
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,874
- Oh.
- # Over night scenes.

459
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,191
# Dinner and wine
Saturday girls.

460
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,477
# I was never in love
Never had the time.

461
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,950
- Honey, Every Woman in the World.
- Every Woman in the World.

462
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,270
# Laughing myself to sleep.

463
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,479
# Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me.

464
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,709
# Oh, oh, oh.

465
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,908
# Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me.

466
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,719
# You're my fantasy.

467
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,953
- # You're my reality
- That's it! Uh, that's the song.

468
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,076
That was totally
off the top of my head.

469
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,949
Known each other for two hours
and we already got a song.

470
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,477
We don't have a song.
How long is this gonna take?

471
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,148
Emma Lloyd, Deepak Manaam Chaturvedi.

472
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,515
- Mr. Manaam Chater...
- Deep. Deep.

473
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,398
- Mr. Deep.
- I recognize you.

474
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,835
The passed-out lady
Patrick carries around.

475
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,718
Yes, that would be me.

476
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,517
- I brought you a little something.
- Oh, how very thoughtful.

477
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,631
Do we have to do this right now?

478
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,593
Delicious.

479
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,069
- It's not unlike a Ring Ding.
- What'd I tell you?

480
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,754
I'm sure you'd really love
a glass of milk with that...

481
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,354
...but I have to get home
and changed for my book party.

482
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,193
- If you don't mind...
- Don't rush. I'm a notary public.

483
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,715
- I took a test.
- OK, I'm sorry.

484
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,269
Um, how long do you
think this will take?

485
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,271
Let's just review, hm?

486
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,796
Signatures... Check.

487
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,431
Dates... Check.

488
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,068
My seal and you'll be
on your way in ten minutes.

489
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,356
- Oh!
- An hour.

490
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,351
A year.

491
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,317
As long as it takes.
Who can say?

492
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,358
Anything you can do to hurry?
I don't mind paying extra.

493
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,877
- Trying to bribe a public official?
- Oh, this is ridiculous. I'm late!

494
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,759
I'm late, and I'll send
a messenger in the morning.

495
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,070
That will be more than enough time.

496
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,277
- I could bring it by the office.
- Oh, no. I will send a messenger.

497
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,273
Thank you, Mr. Sullivan,
for your co-operation.

498
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,352
Well, thank you for thanking me,
Mrs. Sullivan.

499
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,118
- A year?
- Patrick, I'm out. Out.

500
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,953
You had your fun. This is too far.
You should be ashamed.

501
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,873
- A nice lady like that?
- I wanted to give her a taste.

502
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,033
...of her own medicine, period.
And then I... I don't know.

503
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,954
- She's starting to grow on me.
- No. Look, no growing, OK?

504
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,874
No growing on anyone by anyone.
No knees weakened...

505
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,989
...no shines taken to, none of it.
Not on my watch.

506
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,472
Now, go. You and Ajay
have caused enough trouble.

507
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,919
Out!

508
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,071
Dr Lloyd! This way, please!

509
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,993
Dr Lloyd? This camera, please.

510
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,391
- Smile, please.
- Beautiful, thank you.

511
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,358
- Hi.
- Eye contact, please?

512
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,593
- Sign this.
- This way, please.

513
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,069
- And where's Richard?
- Right over there.

514
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,719
Thanks.

515
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,596
- Hi! Oh!
- Not too shabby, huh?

516
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,433
- It's wonderful. I can't believe it.
- Sign these.

517
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,669
OK.

518
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,194
- I have so much to tell you.
- Did you get the papers?

519
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,035
- Um, they're at the notary.
- Excellent. Karl Bollenbecker's here.

520
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,474
- Make that out to him.
- Oh?

521
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,552
He wasn't coming, then his
office said he was. Good or bad?

522
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,950
How could it be bad?
He hasn't even met you.

523
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,156
- You look stunning.
- Thanks.

524
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,754
- What happened to your head?
- Oh! Bird accident.

525
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,753
A pigeon flew into me.
I'll go take care of it.

526
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,309
- Emma? You remember Dr Benton?
- Yes, hi. Nice to see you. Hi, Judy.

527
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,558
No sooner do we leave you then, bang,
I see your picture big on the bus.

528
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,597
Oh! From the cake tasting!

529
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,435
I felt so foolish, I went
and bought your book immediately.

530
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,875
- Oh, that's unnecessary.
- Later I was reading.

531
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,079
...your very sensible observation
and your clinical judgments...

532
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,835
- Are they good things?
- I'm sure some people find them useful...

533
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,754
...but I was surprised that a helpless
romantic can give such practical advice.

534
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,798
- Me? Helpless?
- Oh, yes, you.

535
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,269
Hopelessly helpless,
but let me finish.

536
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,752
So my husband, Karl, returns
to the home and on top of his paper...

537
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,675
...there is an invitation to this
very party. Isn't it amazing?

538
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,956
When you say Karl,
do you mean Karl...

539
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,758
Bollenbecker.

540
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,549
- It's a small world, isn't it?
- Yes!

541
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,508
Teeny. Like a marble.
Or a gumball.

542
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,274
I had to drag Karl
by the ear to come here.

543
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,635
- It is a girly book.
- Oh, no. It's not that.

544
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,509
Karl can be very girly. Only that he
doesn't like to socialize with someone.

545
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,390
- whose company he intends to liquidate.
- Liquidate?

546
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,950
- Who, Richard?
- Yes, but we can fix that.

547
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,795
After this party, you and Richard
will join us for dinner.

548
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,114
If Karl sees the man I saw,
Abdington Books will be safe, I'm sure.

549
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,353
That is unbelievably kind of you...

550
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,717
...but you see, Richard and I made plans
and so we're supposed to...

551
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,030
Only one thing
you're supposed to do, Emma...

552
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,910
...and it's to bring your fiancé to dinner.
Let's find Richard. Karl is waiting.

553
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,433
Oh! Oh, oh, my husband hates you,
but you saved our marriage. Do you mind?

554
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,591
Not at all.
Um, who shall I make it out to?

555
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,193
- To...
- Richard!

556
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,116
Um... Thank you.

557
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,271
Oh, hey, hey.
I brought your papers.

558
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,592
Richard! Sweetheart.
Please go with me on this, OK?

559
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,955
- Remember Greta Bollenbecker?
- Cake lady!

560
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,318
- It's a small world.
- So small. Constantly shrinking.

561
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,119
- It must be the global warming.
- I want to introduce you.

562
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,669
- To my husband.
- Her husband, Karl...

563
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,559
...is Karl Bollenbecker,
who just acquired Richard's...

564
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,269
...your publishing house and he's thinking
of dumping you, Richard, and it.

565
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,512
- Wait, I own a publishing house?
- Yes, and you're my fiancé...

566
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,877
...so please just focus, concentrate.
Got it?

567
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,474
This is him.

568
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,598
- You must be the cake dunker.
- You got me.

569
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,878
- That's my Richard!
- Casual Fridays?

570
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,190
I actually just came
from soccer practice.

571
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,238
- You play football?
- Well, I'm no Lucas Podolski.

572
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,551
Podolski!
Well, nothing could beat Podolski!

573
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,838
I own his team and he is a magnificent
pain in the ass, but a genius.

574
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,275
You own the Bayern München club?

575
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,671
Why don't you use Klose on defense?
He's been under-utilized.

576
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,877
- That's what I told that stupid coach.
- Klinsmann? Gotta go.

577
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,396
- We agree.
- Excuse me. My name's... Ow! Jesus!

578
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,118
- What?...
- Hand noogies!

579
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,796
We give each other hand noogies.
This is my brother, Carl.

580
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,952
Your name is Carl as well?
This is a small world!

581
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,477
Yes, teeny! Like a gimlet. Yes, my tiny,
teeny little brother, but not small.

582
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,791
No. Big. Older, but not by much.

583
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,555
- Carl, who I love so very, very much.
- How's it goin', bro?

584
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,633
- Wine?
- I'm sorry, I'm suddenly very thirsty.

585
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,031
- Carl? Carl?
- Carl.

586
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,953
This is Karl Bollenbecker
and I'm Greta, his wife...

587
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,830
- And we're so charmed by your sister.
- And her outspoken fiancé

588
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,197
who seems to find fault with
every player in the Bundesliga.

589
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,273
- But not Podolski.
- But never Podolski!

590
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,068
So, you sound English,
but your sister...

591
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,596
- Can I borrow Emma?
- Yes, but we both had... I'm sorry.

592
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,957
A hand noogie!

593
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,150
Who is that man out there
pretending to be me?

594
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,390
- I can explain.
- He's wearing sweatpants.

595
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,393
- Sullivan! Honey, you're stress-eating.
- I'm not. Go on.

596
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,836
I wasn't at my father's. I was with
Sullivan. Not "with him" with him...

597
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,073
...but in his apartment drunk. That sounds
worse. I assure you I was fully clothed.

598
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,913
Beyond that, I'm not certain,
except he showed up today.

599
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,116
with papers when I had
to go to the tasting...

600
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,510
which you refused to go
because you're busy...

601
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,274
- Get back to the Bollenbeckers!
- Right. Fine.

602
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,352
At the cake tasting,
there was this sweet lady.

603
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,957
And she thought Sullivan was my fiancé
and I just couldn't disappoint her.

604
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,749
But this lady wasn't sweet at all.
She was Mrs. Bollenbecker...

605
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,229
- which I didn't know.
- You certainly know now!

606
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,472
I do. Had I known I wouldn't
have let the whole thing continue.

607
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,791
But it did continue until everyone
was quite taken with him...

608
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,599
...especially Mrs. Bollenbecker
when he sang.

609
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,069
- He's a singer?
- No, no, no. He's a fireman.

610
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,360
- Darling, are you sure you want that?
- Yes. Yes, I am. What is he doing here?

611
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,988
He came to bring me
the notarized papers.

612
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,676
But then there was Mrs. Bollenbecker.
I'm Emma Lloyd, so he's my fiancé.

613
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,277
- And I am tiny brother Carl.
- Oh, Richard, I'm terribly sorry.

614
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,591
But, uh, oh, look! Mini-cupcakes.

615
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,479
Look, Emma. I only got
about half of what you're saying...

616
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,518
...but this seems to be something
that can be cleaned up easily.

617
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,309
So before you harpoon what is left of my
reputation, I am gonna go in there...

618
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,199
No, no, no, you can't!
They're going to exterminate you.

619
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,999
- What?
- Not you, Abdington Books.

620
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,596
Terminate! No, liquidate! That's it.
Yes, chop it up in little pieces...

621
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,469
...sell it all off! Everything must go!
That's why Karl wasn't coming.

622
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,995
- But he did come!
- Because Mrs. B made him come.

623
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,628
She made him come so he could meet you.

624
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,952
Oh, look. I think he's
really starting to like you.

625
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,680
Oh, all right, I...
Let me think now.

626
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,991
Man owns so many entities, I can buy
a year before our paths cross...

627
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,913
...so we just have to get through this.
A few more minutes?

628
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,915
And a dinner. Tonight. It was Mrs. B's
idea, so Karl could get to know you.

629
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,354
- He's gone.
- Karl?

630
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,636
- No, Sullivan. He's gone.
- But the dinner!

631
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,713
- Get him there!
- Oh, uh...

632
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,958
- Is Sullivan even in here?
- I don't see how he'd fit.

633
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,190
Not now, Marcy.

634
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,439
- Find the lioness within.
- Now, you've read my book?

635
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,195
Mr. Sullivan, Emma Lloyd here.

636
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,429
Here's the deal.

637
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,799
My entire career, and my marriage to
Richard, probably, are at stake here.

638
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,230
Frankly, I need you.
I really need you... Tonight.

639
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,150
- Hello?
- Say "yes" if he's there...

640
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,039
- "Oh, my God" if he's not.
- Oh, my God.

641
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,555
- Oh, my God!
- Don't overdo it.

642
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,393
- You got hit by a cab?
- Good, nice touch.

643
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,031
What hospital are you in? I'll be
right there. He was hit by a cab!

644
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,273
- Who was hit by a cab?
- Is that Sullivan?

645
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,070
Oh! So it was only your foot?
And you're fine, promise?

646
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,196
Oh!

647
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,751
Carl, he got...
a cab ran over his foot Yeah.

648
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,674
- Carl can't catch a break.
- Drink lots of cocoa. Bye-bye, darling!

649
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,868
Richard, I was beginning to think a man
who would leave his fiancée un-attended.

650
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,113
...for so long might not be
as charming as I imagined.

651
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,274
But, no matter.
Please, join us for dessert.

652
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,955
Karl, I know how important
this dinner is to my future.

653
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,395
with the Bollenbecker Group...

654
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,358
...but I've got this family thing.

655
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,432
And where I come from,
family comes first.

656
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,149
So I'm just here
to invite you to a party.

657
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,599
- Could be a lot of fun.
- To family! Above all else!

658
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,751
To family!

659
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,472
You look beautiful.

660
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,039
Nice crowd for your upanayanam, man.

661
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,318
- What's with all the white people?
- Party crashers.

662
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,632
- Even that one?
- No, that one's with me.

663
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,189
Welcome, Emma.

664
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,759
Get up there.

665
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,189
Oh, I love my husband
but he snores at night...

666
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,396
...and it only gets worse...

667
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,068
My husband snores all the time.
I just, tight slap.

668
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,471
- Tight slap.
- You look really cute.

669
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,872
- Why do they snore?
- Check your mehndi for hidden messages.

670
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,073
It's part of the tradition.
When marriages were arranged...

671
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,950
...the groom would search his bride's body
on their wedding night to find initials.

672
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,111
Ah! That's naughty.

673
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,350
- Did I happen to say thank you?
- You did, and you're welcome.

674
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,673
You're not the person
I thought you were, Patrick.

675
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,035
Likewise, Dr Lloyd.

676
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,393
I can't. I have to go.

677
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,076
Wilder? It's me. Can you come get me?

678
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,317
- Hey.
- Hey. Got any beer?

679
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,558
- You did good tonight.
- Thanks.

680
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,598
You gotta tell her, man.
Girls are way into honesty.

681
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,917
All right. Goodnight, you two.

682
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,600
Oh, um, honestly, Wilder.

683
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,957
What am I doing? Running around
Queens in the middle of the night...

684
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,351
...crashing Indian bar mitzvahs two
weeks before my wedding with a man.

685
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,718
- who's technically my husband.
- Beats me, Em.

686
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,553
- Would you like another one?
- Mm, yeah.

687
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,996
- I used extra eggs.
- Thank you, Daddy.

688
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,311
- I wish Mom were here.
- Yeah, me too.

689
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,597
She'd know exactly what to tell you,
wouldn't she?

690
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,990
You're doing all right, actually.

691
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,913
- You still make a mean breakfast.
- I second that.

692
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,833
He also makes amazing smoothies.
Is there time for one?

693
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,391
- Um, no. Uh, Lauren, this is Emma.
- Emma!

694
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,278
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

695
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,558
My mom loves you. I'd listen to your
show, too, but I don't have a radio.

696
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,996
Which reminds me, is there a mall here,
or a Best Buy or something?

697
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,789
Oh, there's a Toys "R" Us.
Maybe they'll have something for her.

698
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,235
Nice to meet you.
Wilder, it's been real.

699
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,472
Um, excuse us a minute.

700
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,598
- Is there something wrong with you?
- No, no, nothing.

701
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,911
I'm just late and I have
to go meet Richard, so...

702
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,595
- Dont jump to conclusions.
- No.

703
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,751
Thanks for breakfast, Father.

704
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,115
Sorry I can't stick around
for the smoothie.

705
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,748
You don't know everything
there is to know.

706
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,959
No, like some things never get old,
and, um... My car is here.

707
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,159
Look, this time, you're
really wrong, Emma. You are.

708
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,559
Goodbye, Wilder.

709
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,915
Bye, sweetheart.

710
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,196
Daddy loves you, nonetheless.

711
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,797
The golf tee white is stylish,
but, um, I just, it's been done.

712
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,635
And it's not as common as the
picket fence white, which is safe...

713
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,950
...but it's a bit boring.

714
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,556
The Navajo white is bolder,
but it's sort of in-your-face white.

715
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,235
I don't know, um...
They all look the same to me.

716
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,710
- In what way?
- In that they're all white.

717
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,873
Yes, but different,
I mean, wildly different.

718
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,508
Are you not going
to ask me about last night?

719
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,910
Well, I assumed it went pretty well.

720
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,709
Bollenbecker Group just renewed my
contract five years, thanks to you.

721
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,509
Now, all we need to do is file those
papers and we'll put this behind us.

722
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,830
Um, well...

723
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,599
I don't have the papers.

724
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,910
- What's going on, Em?
- I don't know.

725
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,595
He had them at the book signing.
Between the dinner and the upanayanam...

726
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,992
Indian bar mitzvah, don't ask,
I misplaced them.

727
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,355
- I had them in my hands!
- Don't worry about it.

728
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,557
- It's so unlike me.
- It's all right.

729
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,154
I'm gonna take care of everything
from now on.

730
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,757
A white lie is still a lie.
It may be a subtler shade of truth...

731
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,480
...but anyone's who's looking
can see it on the wall.

732
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,790
So I should tell him the truth.

733
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,953
I'm saying that a cream-colored,
ivory-hued, matte-finished, half-truth.

734
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,795
will erode the foundation
of your relationship.

735
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,112
- You're getting married soon, right?
- Yep. That's right.

736
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,398
Your fiancé must be a lucky man
to know he has you to keep him honest.

737
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,073
We're both very lucky.

738
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,550
Brother Carl.
Didn't know you played.

739
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,156
Let's drop the bullshit, shall we?
It's Richard.

740
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,108
- Richard Braxton, as you well know.
- Patrick Sullivan, as you well know.

741
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,999
Hell, we're practically family.

742
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,232
You behaved like a real gentleman
over a rather odd period.

743
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,630
Emma tells me you did me a good turn.

744
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,712
- And I appreciate that.
- It was fun.

745
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,713
I have to play the spoil-sport
and ask for those papers.

746
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,758
- So we can go separate ways.
- I'll bring them by the office.

747
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,309
- No, that's not gonna happen.
- Why's that?

748
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,755
She and I have a life
which doesn't include you...

749
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,276
...and I want to keep it that way.
So I'm asking you man-to-man.

750
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,877
- Not to see her, call her, text her.
- I'm not much of a texter.

751
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,839
Somebody in your circle seems
to have a gift for technology.

752
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,834
- What do you mean?
- The more I look into this glitch...

753
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,992
...as Emma calls it,
the less accidental it seems.

754
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,709
You might be technologically-challenged.
Anyone close to you.

755
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,637
- Might be able to pull this off?
- Not off the top of my head, no.

756
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,676
I intend to find out who did this.

757
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,875
[# Nouvelle Vague: Ever Fallen in Love.

758
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,319
Something wrong with him.

759
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,993
I know you've been there.
We've all been there.

760
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,676
Sounds like a crush. You're a grown
woman, let's call it an infatuation.

761
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,559
...far bigger problems
than what you have now.

762
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,599
You're dreaming! Wake up, girl. Do you
share the vision of the future?

763
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,115
Is he dependable?
You have to ask yourself.

764
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,511
Smart, successful, beautiful women
cannot live on kisses alone.

765
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,390
You may think the chemistry
has commonality with friendship.

766
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,394
Take a look at the compatibility
quizzes in my book, chapter seven.

767
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,915
- You'll find it illuminating.
- Thank you.

768
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,834
Thank you, caller.
Hi, you're on the air.

769
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,675
I'm reading your book, too.
You call this a self-help book.

770
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,718
- Or does that term offend?
- Uh, not in the least.

771
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,273
- Who does it help, exactly?
- Well, it...

772
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,230
See, the thing is, I, um... I haven't
gotten to the helpful part yet.

773
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,392
- Perhaps you're a slow reader.
- No, it doesn't tell you how

774
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,189
...to find somebody to love, or how you
get somebody to love you back.

775
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,069
All it does is tell you what's wrong
with the person you're in love with.

776
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,674
That to me, well,
that's not very helpful.

777
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,833
Perhaps it is you who are wrong for
the person you think you are right for.

778
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,072
What is it you know about me
that would make you say that?

779
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,117
- I don't know you.
- You bet you don't.

780
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,589
I don't. Since you called,
here's some advice.

781
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,115
Instead of blaming others
for your problems...

782
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,511
- Consider looking at yourself.
- I'm looking right at my problem.

783
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,630
- Well, stop fogging up the mirror.
- Nice.

784
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,759
- Did you just hang up on a caller?
- I did not just hang up on a caller.

785
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,074
Hello? Hello? Uh, hello?
I think we've been disconnected.

786
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,232
It must be those cell phones,
those nasty cell phones.

787
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,837
Thanks to my caller for calling
and I will be seeing you tomorrow

788
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,514
...for the next
Real Love with Dr Emma Lloyd.

789
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,949
Are you crazy? How dare you come to my
place of work and make prank calls?

790
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,634
I'm flipping through this
and it was so full of crap.

791
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,429
- That maybe I ought to call in!
- I see you actually bought my book.

792
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,717
- No. I stole it from your party.
- Stole it. That makes sense.

793
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,791
And I took your compatibility quiz.

794
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,155
- Really? How did you do?
- According to this...

795
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,199
...my lifestyle is wholly unsuitable to
any freak who would buy or write a book.

796
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,114
- Like this.
- Surprise. Those tests don't lie.

797
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,794
New York City Fire Department.
Official business.

798
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,475
Please exit the elevator.
Come on, ladies. Sir, thank you.

799
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,234
- What are you doing?
- Unsuitable?

800
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,269
Is that really what you think of me?

801
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,637
I don't think of you.

802
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,109
You want to see unsuitable?

803
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,116
Hey, security...

804
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,510
- what's the story with the elevator?
- Holy!

805
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,196
- My wife loves her show.
- Delivery.

806
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,635
I can't even get a guy
to hold a door for me.

807
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,110
- Step back, please.
- Can you fix the focus on that?

808
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,510
- Zoom in a little bit.
- There you go.

809
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:33,998
I've had enough of this. Excuse me, sir?
Doctor? Doctor?

810
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,789
I'm gonna have to ask you
to please stop. Stop what you're doing.

811
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,396
Come down to the lobby immediately.
Stop it.

812
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,471
Stop it now, please.

813
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,709
- Sorry about that.
- Which part, exactly?

814
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,030
- Kissing you thing.
- We just got caught up.

815
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,794
- Carried away.
- Lost our heads.

816
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,237
I'm getting married.

817
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,030
Yeah.

818
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,872
You love him?

819
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,032
I only ask this because...

820
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,875
...being that I'm your husband and
you're my wife, I have this...

821
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,157
I have this vested interest
in seeing you happy.

822
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,233
I want to be happy. Don't you?

823
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,755
What is happiness anyway?

824
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,073
I don't know.

825
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,231
You tell me, you wrote the book.

826
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,516
I guess I don't know.

827
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,679
- Patrick...
- It was nice being married to you.

828
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,312
You, too.

829
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,991
- Thanks.
- Goodbye, Emma.

830
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,115
Oh! Oh, oh!

831
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,190
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know, I'm always so prompt.

832
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,911
Don't worry. When I arrived, I told them
to bring the drinks in ten minutes.

833
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,072
- How's that for timing?
- Oh, what a day. You have no idea.

834
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,038
Actually, I kind of do.

835
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,997
I heard your show today.

836
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,230
- That was Sullivan, I take it?
- Yes.

837
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,153
The good news is I got the papers.

838
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,472
Everything but page 127,
and I'm sure it's in there somewhere.

839
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,349
- We'll never see him again.
- So why don't you look happy?

840
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,112
I am.

841
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,714
Well, I've got something
that might cheer you up.

842
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,317
Harry Winston finished our rings.
Now, wanna have a look?

843
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,831
Wow!

844
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,788
See, the circle of eternity
came out great, don't you think?

845
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,476
- No. They did mine wrong.
- What are you talking about?

846
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,995
- It's perfect.
- It says "Do I? Do I? Do I?"

847
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,559
Not "I do, I do, I do."

848
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,476
Em, you're under a tremendous
amount of stress at the moment.

849
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,200
It's not stress, Richard.
I just don't know.

850
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,828
I'm really confused.

851
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,037
Well, I'm not confused, Em.
I know exactly what I want.

852
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,479
I think you and I are the perfect team.
Never doubted it for a moment.

853
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,030
But I am not gonna
talk you into marrying me.

854
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,668
Take a few days
and figure out what it is you want.

855
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,559
In fact, why don't we
begin that right now.

856
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,631
Richard.

857
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,393
We had a really
nice time. Good conversation.

858
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,632
He was sweet and funny,
but I don't know. Something's missing.

859
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,633
- There was no... Exactly.
- Spark?

860
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,189
Yeah, let me
tell you something about sparks.

861
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,955
Sparks cause fires and fires
will burn your house down.

862
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,476
Keep searching for good ol' Sparky,
you're sure to get burned.

863
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,154
Trust me on that, OK?

864
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,308
Oh, I'm so hungry!

865
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,870
Wilder!
Your girlfriend's wearing my robe!

866
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,477
Actually, his girlfriend's daughter
is wearing your robe.

867
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,518
- Hello, Emma.
- Aren't you my?...

868
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,715
So, um, why the big secret?

869
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,952
I wanted to tell you.
Your father thought you wouldn't hire me.

870
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,917
...as caterer
if you knew we were dating.

871
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,709
- Is that what you call it?
- That or this is an elaborate ruse.

872
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,589
- Of yours to get out of paying my bill.
- You have been worth every penny.

873
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,151
There you go again,
always saying the perfect thing.

874
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,835
You've been together for almost a year.
Why didn't you tell me?

875
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,037
You've met so many women over the years,
I thought I'd hold off.

876
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,794
...on this introduction
until we were sure of each other.

877
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,633
- And are we?
- Well, I am.

878
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,351
I can't even keep track of all
the things I've misunderstood.

879
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,839
Sorry.

880
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,072
Dad? I know I never asked you...

881
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,313
...but, um, what do you think of Richard?
Do you like him?

882
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:36,634
Well, sure, honey. What's not to like?
I mean, he's perfect, isn't he?

883
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,349
- Is that a compliment?
- You don't need compliments from me.

884
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,034
I've never told you
how to live or who to date.

885
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,192
That's always been in your department.

886
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,432
So, what if I'm, uh,
losing my footing in my department.

887
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,070
...and I'm asking for a second opinion?

888
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,119
Well, I think Richard is a...

889
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,111
...a good, safe bet. You know?

890
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,158
He's the kind of guy
that you've always gravitated toward.

891
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,393
...and advised other women to pursue,
isn't he?

892
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,678
Probably the type of fellow that my
brand of fatherhood pushed you into.

893
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,035
Look, honey, I mean...

894
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,988
I've made some big mistakes in my life,
some real whoppers...

895
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,914
...but if I hadn't I probably wouldn't have
been able to recognize the real thing.

896
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:26,598
when it came along. You don't
have to be so right all the time.

897
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,398
It's OK to make a couple mistakes.

898
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,834
- Hello, tall lady!
- Oh, Emma!

899
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,673
Emma, you're drenched.
Come, darling.

900
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,229
- Move, she has to eat something.
- Quiet!

901
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,837
Can't you see that she's not here
to eat or watch telly or chit-chat?

902
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,275
She's come for the man she loves.

903
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,035
Here you are with your "come, come"
and your "sit, sit" and your "eat, eat".

904
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,317
You're standing in the course
of true love. Stand aside, I say!

905
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,869
Through the beads,
up the stairs, two flights.

906
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,511
What?

907
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,789
Yeah, it's raining.

908
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,030
Figured you'd have the day off.

909
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,913
Come in.

910
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,872
Oh, here you go.

911
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,077
Let me, uh,
let me get you some dry clothes.

912
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,828
- Patrick?
- Yeah.

913
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,070
I think I called off my wedding.

914
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,428
Emma, I...
I need to tell you something.

915
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,992
- What?
- It can wait.

916
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,553
Oh.

917
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,071
- How's it going in there, babe?
- Great!

918
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,630
- We're having toast!
- I'll be out in a minute.

919
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,268
OK.

920
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,834
# You're my fantasy.

921
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,468
# You're my reality.

922
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,630
# Every woman in the world.

923
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,873
What is this? And this? And this?
Are you some sick stalker?

924
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,156
No, Emma, it's not what you think.
Emma!

925
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,550
- Emma! Emma, wait!
- I can't believe this.

926
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,597
I saw the invitation. You're married?

927
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,878
- No! No, I'm not married!
- Liar. Stay away from me!

928
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,837
Emma! Emma, I can explain.

929
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,391
Yeah? What, that this is no accident?
There was no glitch?

930
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,155
No, you. You are the glitch.
You Googled me, invaded my life...

931
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,995
...invaded my privacy,
ruined my relationship.

932
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,958
I almost called off my wedding for you!

933
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,839
I trusted you! I had sex with you.

934
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,709
You're just some sort of con man,
scam artist, deranged fan?

935
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,952
- Know what? Don't flatter yourself.
- I... What have I done?

936
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:27,113
Richard warned me about you. I warn
people about men like you every day!

937
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,510
- I'm worse than my own callers.
- Emma! Stop!

938
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,477
Thank you.

939
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,030
Can I show you something? Please?

940
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,553
Do you know her?

941
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,195
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you don't. Come here.

942
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,037
That's Sofia, as in "You're cordially
invited to the marriage.

943
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,113
...of Patrick Thomas Sullivan
and Sofia Idelia Maria Chechagua."

944
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,352
She's Dominican. We met on the job.
She almost blew up a building.

945
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,115
...polishing those nails of hers.
I carried her down 15 flights of stairs.

946
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,748
...and sat next to her hospital bed
until she woke up.

947
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,276
- What does this have to do with me?
- She was a big fan of your show.

948
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,398
Listened to it every day.
One day, she called in.

949
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,313
- You probably don't remember.
- No, I don't.

950
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,472
- You told her to call off the wedding.
- Patrick...

951
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,677
Someone you don't know and can't
remember, you changed her life.

952
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,798
...and mine forever.

953
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,269
I guess I wanted
to educate you about that.

954
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,989
About what it's like to have your
life ripped out from under you.

955
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,912
I wanted to knock you down a peg.

956
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,554
- You did.
- Emma, I...

957
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,234
- Goodbye, Patrick.
- Emma.

958
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,118
Emma.

959
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,670
It's beautiful.

960
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,799
I was just thinking how... How it's
too big for me without you here.

961
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,315
Are you here?

962
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,518
If you'll have me.

963
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,917
Do you mean you still
want to get married?

964
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,957
I do.

965
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,677
I do. I do.

966
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,878
As many of you have heard,
I'm getting married.

967
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,635
People keep asking me if I'm nervous.
Well, I'm not.

968
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,156
My eyes are open and what I see
is not the man of my dreams...

969
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,276
...but the man of my reality.

970
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,318
He's who he says he is,
there where he's supposed to be.

971
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,074
If you want to close your eyes
and jump in...

972
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,549
...try the high-diving board at the YMCA.

973
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,557
There's a generation of men
and women roaming New York City.

974
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,951
...in search of the
holy grail dream partner.

975
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,830
But until we learn the difference
between romantic love and real love...

976
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,630
we're just searching in vain for
something that doesn't even exist.

977
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,679
Here we are. Until next time.

978
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,071
Ask yourself serious questions.

979
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,471
Couples shouldn't have to hide.
Play with fire, get burned.

980
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,552
Irresponsible. Dependable?
You can't trust what you lust.

981
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,474
Does he give you a stable universe?
Love has to be earned, not yearned.

982
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,191
Stop obsessing about this old girlfriend
of his. Got it? All right. Next caller.

983
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,749
It's a hard decision.
Am I right? Well, caller...

984
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,718
Trust me on that. Next caller.
Based on what? What?

985
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,552
Trust me on that, OK?
OK, well...

986
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,439
Um... I don't know.
What do you want from me?

987
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,194
- Real Love is just a theory.
- A theory, yes...

988
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,399
...but based on ten years of research
and study of sociological, psychosexual...

989
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,599
...statistical analysis of men and women
and their relationships.

990
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,957
What if you're wrong?

991
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,315
Hello? You still there?

992
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,033
Take that one.
Trust me, she needs to take that one.

993
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,795
It's 15 minutes after the hour and
you're listening to Real Love with me...

994
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,757
Dr Emma Lloyd.

995
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:03,716
Uh...

996
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,958
Yep, we got time
for one more caller. We've got...

997
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,036
Patrick of Astoria.

998
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,474
- Patrick of Astoria.
- Oh, really?

999
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,279
I thought for a second
you weren't gonna put me through.

1000
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:22,399
Thousands of people are listening. Let's
not waste their time. How can I help?

1001
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,190
There's... There's this girl that I'm...
that I'm falling for.

1002
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,079
That I have fallen for.

1003
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,313
And, uh, well the trick is she's...
she's getting married tomorrow.

1004
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,313
And if that's what she really wants,
then I'm happy for her.

1005
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,278
That's very generous of you,
Patrick from Astoria.

1006
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,954
There's one other thing that...

1007
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,759
...that she doesn't know.
- We're almost out of time.

1008
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,515
The thing that
I didn't tell her is, um...

1009
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,955
- The thing she doesn't know...
- Come on.

1010
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,270
...is that I love her.

1011
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,513
You know, I, uh, I look at her
and I see, I see my whole life.

1012
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,673
And I just thought
she should know that.

1013
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,308
I'm afraid that's
all the time we have, caller.

1014
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,836
This is Dr Emma Lloyd.

1015
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,911
And you're listening to Real Love.

1016
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,957
Where's she going?

1017
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,076
- Get in there.
- OK.

1018
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,435
Let's see, we got, um, Chuck.

1019
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,319
...on line four is looking
for his soul mate...

1020
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,156
...and Maria on line two
just got dumped. So, Chuck?

1021
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,390
- Yeah?
- Say what's up to Maria.

1022
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,549
How you doin'?

1023
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,476
Well? Do you really like it?

1024
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,030
- Perfect. You're perfect.
- I'm fucked.

1025
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,078
It's an interesting segue.

1026
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,550
- Did you listen to the show last night?
- Yes.

1027
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,551
- He loves me.
- I know.

1028
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,917
The entire tri-state area knows.
The car's here.

1029
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,039
- What am I gonna do?
- Well, first thing we should fire her.

1030
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,158
- I heard that.
- Sister at the keyhole...

1031
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,232
- Just what you always wanted, huh?
- I did, didn't I?

1032
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,755
Instead you got you and me.

1033
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,276
We didn't do too badly, did we?
We were a disaster.

1034
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,953
Yeah, we were.

1035
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,512
But I see a comeback in the making.

1036
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,955
Yeah?

1037
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,317
For a guy who's waited
this long to marry my daughter...

1038
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,438
...he sure is cutting it close,
don't you think?

1039
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,273
- Do you know how I know I love you?
- How?

1040
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:42,194
Because nothing in the world would
make me drag you to the altar again.

1041
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,749
We don't want
to press our luck, do we?

1042
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,632
I should go see how Emma's doing.
Let me know if he gets here.

1043
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,517
- Take it off, Marcy. It's crooked.
- Let me try.

1044
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,275
Oh, so this goes like this.

1045
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,151
And this... Goes here.

1046
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,156
Here comes the bride.

1047
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,229
I can't do this.

1048
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,395
Excuse me, ladies.
Could I have a moment?

1049
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,876
- Richard...
- Wow.

1050
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,473
Look at you.

1051
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:53,033
Seems kind of silly, though, huh?
Me in this dress, veil.

1052
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,556
Bridesmaids. It's like
some sort of play or something.

1053
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,871
No, you don't look silly.

1054
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,357
Well, you look extremely not silly
and handsome yourself.

1055
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,748
I'm sorry I'm late. I had to go back
to the city and get something for you.

1056
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,672
You forgot to file them.

1057
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,033
You should know by now,
I'm not really the forgetful type.

1058
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,873
No, no you're not.

1059
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:38,433
Ever since you gave me these, I've been
putting off filing them for some reason.

1060
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,478
Why do you think that is?

1061
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,030
I love you, Em.

1062
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,430
I'm clever enough
to know when I've lost.

1063
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,553
I should have asked you
to marry me a long time ago.

1064
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,188
Well, maybe we just missed our moment.

1065
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:05,352
If you marry me today, you'll
always be looking over your shoulder.

1066
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,590
You'll never be completely happy.

1067
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,276
- You need to be happy, Em.
- I can't stand it.

1068
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,874
Oh, Richard.

1069
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,676
It'll be all right.

1070
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,749
I'll be all right. As soon as we
can get past that angry mob out there.

1071
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,275
Oh, yeah, them.

1072
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,317
I'll handle this.

1073
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,674
Really?

1074
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,354
No, not really. In fact, this time you
should worry. I have no plan.

1075
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:50,958
Come on, help me up.
Give me that candle.

1076
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,509
Would you just wait until I've left
the room. I might need this suit again.

1077
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,318
Richard?

1078
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,119
Engine 41,
this is Great Neck dispatch.

1079
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,750
We've got a fire alarm and sprinkler
activation at Saint Paul's church.

1080
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,593
Great Neck?
It's not even in our district.

1081
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,753
Listen, I know it's out of your
district, but here's the thing.

1082
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,912
You guys have sort of been requested.

1083
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:26,791
- How you doin'?
- I had to talk to you!

1084
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,275
You could have just called.

1085
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,390
So, what's up?

1086
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,589
This.

1087
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,836
When I was a kid...

1088
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,310
I used to have a hard time
believing in happy endings.

1089
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:07,110
The heroine rode off into the sunset
with what I thought was the wrong guy.

1090
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,511
One day, my dad found me crying.
I was watching Lady and the Tramp.

1091
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:14,798
...and he asked me what was wrong.
I said, "Dad, those two dogs.

1092
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,511
...don't stand a chance. They're wrong for
each other. They have nothing in common.

1093
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,593
The movie's gonna end, they're gonna
break up and be heartbroken forever."

1094
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,593
He pulled me in close and he said to me...

1095
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,834
"Em, sometimes when you're really in
love you don't sweat the small stuff."

1096
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,639
Are you saying
we should run away together?

1097
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,268
Are you insane?
You're old enough to be his mother.

1098
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,635
- Wait till he gets out of school.
- Who is this?

1099
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,268
- Good day to you, madam.
- You were going to behave.

1100
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:46,718
I don't know how you do this. People
drive me crazy. It won't happen again.

1101
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,714
- Where was I?
- Don't sweat the small stuff.

1102
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,952
I didn't appreciate
my father's advice for a long time.

1103
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:57,556
You have to figure out those things
for yourself. But enough about me.

1104
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,110
It's a quarter past the hour and now
for a word from our sponsors.

1105
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,717
This is Dr Emma Lloyd, you're listening
to Real Love. Please, don't go away.

1106
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,792
Haven't you got any
cats to pull out of trees?

1107
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,839
That only happens in cartoons,
Mrs. Sullivan, as you well know.

1108
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,468
Indeed I do, Mr. Sullivan.
What can I do for ya?

1109
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,872
Happened to be in the neighborhood,
thought I'd stop by and say hello.

1110
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,999
- Why don't ya come here for a second?
- I can't leave my desk.

1111
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:31,516
- I have to be back on any second.
- Oh, come on. They can wait.

1112
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,592
Just stand up and walk towards me.

1113
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,389
- You didn't come to see me at all.
- Of course, I did.

1114
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,197
OK.

1115
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:12,351
And we're back
in five, four, three, two, one.

1116
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,115
This is Dr Emma Lloyd.
We're back with Real Love.

1117
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,716
Susie from Morningside Heights,
you're on the air.
