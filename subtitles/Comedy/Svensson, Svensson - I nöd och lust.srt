158
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:43,363
Because he's paying me.

159
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,296
To house-sit.

160
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,629
[ Sighs ]
Twenty dollars an hour?

161
00:10:52,705 --> 00:10:56,107
When did it go up?

162
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:59,009
He wants to believe
that Lisa's still there.

163
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,138
I make it easier for him
to convince himself.

164
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:09,288
Francis always had strange ways
to convince himself...

165
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:12,291
of many things.

166
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:18,127
Things that never happened,
things that might happen.

167
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:23,796
People who did things
for reasons, but they didn't.

168
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:30,310
What has any of this
got to do with me, Dad?

169
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,815
Nothing.

170
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:39,978
Nothing at all.

171
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:43,989
So why do I have
to keep going there?

172
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,321
You don't.

173
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,826
And you'll tell him?

174
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,161
[ Thomas ] I was in here the other night
when that guy was thrown out.

175
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:02,937
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?

176
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:07,105
- Why do you think he would touch you?
- Why do you think he would touch you?

177
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,275
Why do you think
he would touch you?

178
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,945
Well, what do you think
was going through his mind when he--

179
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,616
- Or-Or what was he thinking?
- [ Laughs ]

180
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,285
- Well--
- What's so funny?

181
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,295
Well, this is a joke, right?

182
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:24,627
Not at all.

183
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:29,430
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.

184
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:35,200
But I'm not hiding anything.

185
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:39,575
Thomas, you're hiding
a smuggling operation...

186
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:44,641
that brings in over $200,000 a year,
probably a lot more.

187
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,743
We've suspected you
for a long time.

188
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,311
I was just brought in to confirm
what was already known.

189
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:52,882
So how do you want me
to report back?

190
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,656
[ Sighs ]

191
00:12:56,729 --> 00:13:00,392
All I'm asking
for is a bit of help.

192
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:03,027
That's all.

193
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,665
It's very important
for me to know these things.
Just ask her these questions.

194
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:12,007
Do this for me,
and you have a clean slate.

195
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,881
[ Groans ]
This really hasn't been my day.

196
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,388
So change things.
Make it your day.

197
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:24,456
* Exotica **

198
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,959
[ Eric ] And all you men sitting
near that stage, I can see you.

199
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:29,119
I know what you're thinking.

200
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:32,460
You're thinking that "because I'm
sitting next to that stage...

201
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:35,296
I'm getting the same feeling
as all those guys...

202
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:39,305
shoveling out that cash
for their own private dancer."

203
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:43,469
Well, you know, you guys want
to watch, go to the movies.

204
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:46,307
We're in the live-action
business here, gents.

205
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:52,147
And, okay, granted--
Granted, that beautiful creature
writhing before you on stage...

206
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,312
she maybe, you know,
smiles at you.

207
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,323
She winks her eyes at you
occasionally...

208
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:59,655
and you may feel
like the man.

209
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,718
Is that all you guys
are looking for?

210
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:05,753
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.

211
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,768
Invite one of our lovely ladies over
to your table where the real action is.

212
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:12,430
- [ Eric Growls ] Yeah!
- Hi.

213
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:15,099
I'm really sorry that took so long,
or I took so long.

214
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,267
- Hi.
- It's such a busy night.

215
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:20,278
Hi. I'm Chrissy.

216
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:23,110
Hi. I'm Thomas.

217
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:27,619
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.

218
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,622
Oh, thanks.

219
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,782
Are you from out of town?

220
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:33,792
Yes.

221
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,124
Where are you from?

222
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:40,291
Um... San Francisco.

223
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:43,131
Oh, you're kidding.
I love San Francisco.

224
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:45,796
Oh, you've--
You've been there?

225
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:51,140
Yeah, I was there a couple of years ago
with my debating team.

226
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,304
- Debating team?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:57,146
[ Thomas Over Speaker ]
Um, that's-- I admire
someone who can debate well.

228
00:14:57,217 --> 00:15:00,310
I mean, who can debate
i-instead of just argue.

229
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:04,824
Well, anyone can argue, but i-it's
a good skill, uh, discipline...

230
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:07,656
to be able to debate
and stand back.

231
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:10,993
Um, and that's something
you can apply in your life...

232
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:13,329
- outside of school.
- [ Christina ] Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

233
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,334
And, and when you're meeting
someone or negotiating.

234
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:20,839
- Negotiating?
- Well, I mean, if you have--
If you have to--

235
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:25,844
Um, it's a good skill to learn,
as opposed to cheerleading or--

236
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:27,847
Well, that's what I say.

237
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:30,349
Don't be nervous
about this, Thomas.

238
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,853
- We're gonna have some fun, okay?
- Sure.

239
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:36,515
Sure.

240
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,696
Um... um...

241
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:58,040
I was here
the other night, um--

242
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:00,046
What night was that?

243
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:03,310
The night th-that guy
was thrown out.

244
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:05,647
You were dancing for him.

245
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,653
His name is Francis.

246
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:11,247
Um... what happened?

247
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:15,819
[ Sighing ]

248
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:18,830
He was a bad boy.

249
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:23,767
- Wh-What do you mean by that?
- What do I mean?

250
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:26,863
I mean, have you danced
for him before a lot?

251
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,873
Mm-hmm.

252
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:32,070
-And has he ever been thrown out before?
-No.

253
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:34,306
So what do you
think happened?

254
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:37,508
He touched me.

255
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:40,518
And when you're dancing
for the customer...

256
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:43,350
they can't touch.

257
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:46,256
Yes, but why do you think
he touched you last night?

258
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:49,055
Has he ever touched you before?

259
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:52,189
Is this what you really want to talk
about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?

260
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:56,464
Well, I just want to know
what you think was going on in his mind.

261
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:59,903
Are you here for some kind
of psychology conference?

262
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:03,806
[ Laughs ]
Uh, well, uh, yes.

263
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:06,641
Uh, I am, actually.

264
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:09,648
He's, uh--

265
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,980
He's a very particular case.

266
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:16,317
Particular in what way?

267
00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:23,325
Um...
you want the full story?

268
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:27,697
Sure.

269
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,374
His daughter was murdered
a couple of years ago...

270
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:39,003
and then he was implicated.

271
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,672
- [ Thomas ] For th-the murder?
- Yeah.

272
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:47,015
- But why?
- I-I don't know. I don't
really remember the details.

273
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:50,180
I mean, he was cleared, and then
they caught the guy who did it.

274
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:54,523
But... it obviously had,
like, this...

275
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:56,528
- this incredible effect on him.
- [ Sniffles ]

276
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:59,862
I mean, he is--

277
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:03,959
He's just so fucked up about it.

278
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:05,970
Oh.

279
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,304
You know...

280
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:15,314
Thomas...

281
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:20,046
Francis and I have
a very special type of relationship.

282
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,316
And I-I've never--
I've never minded.

283
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,825
But then he chose
to violate it.

284
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:29,657
S-Special in what way?

285
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:40,169
Well, we've, we've always
had this understanding.

286
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:43,334
I mean, I need him
for certain things...

287
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,344
and... he needs me
for certain things.

288
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:48,846
I mean, that's the way it's been.

289
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:52,180
Uh, and how did he
violate that?

290
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:58,019
He-He violated that in his-his,
in his role and what he was
supposed to do for me.

291
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:00,582
Wh-What's he su-- Why?

292
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,892
What's he supposed to do
for you? I mean, he comes
to this club. He pays you.

293
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:07,797
Because I was
doing things for him...

294
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:10,860
and he's done things
for me.

295
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:14,133
[ Static, Christina Crying
Over Speaker ]

296
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:17,471
[ Thomas ]
What has he done for you?

297
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:20,478
- [ Siren Wailing ]
- [ Christina Sniffling ] I'm--

298
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:23,982
[ Crying ]
I'm sorry.

299
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,113
[ Continues Crying ]
Okay, this is really stupid.

300
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:34,990
And then I'm getting so emotional
over the fact that he touched me...

301
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:39,327
because, I mean, he was,
he was always paying me...

302
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:42,492
to do him this favor and--
[ Sighs ]

303
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,503
- What favor?
- I don't know, Thomas.

304
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:48,507
- Why do you want to know all this?
- Well, I'm sorry, but l, uh--

305
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:53,068
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives
her that special innocence, gentlemen?

306
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:57,172
Such a thing that you have
absolutely no control over.

307
00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:00,844
You never have.

308
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:05,017
And you never will.

309
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:08,288
- After this break, we'll be right
back with sweet Chrissy...
