1
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,519
What's this war in the heart of nature?

2
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,614
Why does nature vie with itself?

3
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,400
The land contend with the sea?

4
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,544
Is there an avenging power in nature?

5
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,925
Not one power, but two?

6
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,289
I remember my mother when she was dying.

7
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,710
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

8
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,175
I asked her if she was afraid.

9
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,970
She just shook her head.

10
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,181
I was afraid to touch the death I seen in her.

11
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:37,938
I couldn't fiind nothing beautiful or uplifting
about her going back to God.

12
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:45,236
I heard people talk about immortality,
but I ain't seen it.

13
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,226
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

14
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:03,274
What it'd be like to know that this breath now
was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

15
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,737
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

16
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,535
With the same... calm.

17
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:22,206
Cos that's where it's hidden -
the immortality I hadn't seen.

18
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,962
Kids around here never fight.

19
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,502
Sometimes.

20
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,596
Sometimes when you see them playing

21
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,840
they always fight!

22
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,309
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.

23
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,070
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.

24
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,273
- Why?
- Cos you look...

25
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,692
You look as an army!

26
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,861
- I look army?
- Yes.

27
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,698
Well, that don't matter.

28
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,494
It doesn't matter.

29
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,041
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.

30
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,084
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

31
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,951
All right, come on. Turn around.

32
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,121
Go, go, go, go. Go!

33
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,040
Come on, go.

34
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,046
Go, go, go, go!

35
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,561
Witt, patrol boat!

36
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,731
She's American.

37
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,702
What's it doing out here all alone?

38
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,525
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

39
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,906
You haven't learned a thing.

40
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:07,207
All a man has to do is leave it to you,
you'll putyour head in the noose for him.

41
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,666
How many times you been AWOL?

42
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,383
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

43
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,471
Ain't it time you smartened up
and stopped being such a punk recruit?

44
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,637
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

45
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,805
We can't all be smart.

46
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,891
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

47
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,062
Look atyou.

48
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:45,036
Truth is,
you can't take straight duty in my company.

49
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,991
You'll never be a real soldier,
not in God's world.

50
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,373
This is C Company,
of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

51
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:01,294
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy
who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

52
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,219
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

53
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,599
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

54
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,182
But I worked a deal for ya.

55
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,351
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

56
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:20,654
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

57
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:25,153
You'll be a stretcher-bearer.
You'll be taking care of the wounded.

58
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,456
I can take anything you dish out.

59
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,866
I'm twice the man you are.

60
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,423
In this world...

61
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,182
a man himself is nothing.

62
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:57,902
And there ain't no world but this one.

63
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,690
You're wrong there, Top.

64
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,570
I seen another world.

65
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:17,036
Sometimes I think
it was just... my imagination.

66
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,542
Well,

67
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,334
then you've seen things I never will.

68
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:39,521
We're living in a world that's blowing itself
to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

69
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:45,445
In a situation like that all a man can do
is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

70
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,610
Look out for himself.

71
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,586
I might be the best friend you ever had.

72
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,879
You don't even know it.

73
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,709
He hates you worse than poison.

74
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,962
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

75
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,006
I love Charlie Company.

76
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,055
They're my people.

77
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,838
They call it "The Rock".

78
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,174
Nobody wants this island.
Japs just put an airfield there.

79
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,135
Fighting's confined to this area.

80
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:16,808
This is their road to Australia, and this is their
way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

81
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:22,101
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the
South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

82
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,693
The Marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.

83
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,231
Worked my ass off.

84
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,859
Brown-nosed the generals.

85
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,197
Degraded myself

86
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,250
for them and my family.

87
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,622
For my home.

88
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,585
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.

89
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,631
Most men your age
would have retired by now.

90
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,798
It's OK.

91
00:16:56,517 --> 00:17:00,514
We need general officers
with maturity and character like you.

92
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,973
We've got good sergeants
and good lieutenant colonels.

93
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,435
But once a man gets those eagles,
he can't wait to get that star.

94
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,604
He becomes a politician, right?

95
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,772
Goes along to get along.

96
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:16,492
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

97
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,623
- You said it there, sir.
- With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

98
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,625
- There's always someone watching.
- Yeah.

99
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,661
Like a hawk.

100
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,875
Always someone ready to jump in,
if you're not.

101
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,305
- D'you have a son, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:48,810
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons
fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

103
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,437
- No, sir, we sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.

104
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,567
You dig them out of the hills
and protect that airfield.

105
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,533
Yes, sir.

106
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:03,788
You wonder why... Why did the Japs
put an airfield there of all places?

107
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,953
I guess we don't knowthe bigger picture,
if there is such a thing.

108
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:12,127
- What do you think?
- Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

109
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,877
You're a humble man.

110
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,216
Nobody wants that island... butyou.

111
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,801
How much do you want it?

112
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,302
As much as I have to, sir.

113
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,236
All they sacrifiicedfor me

114
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,033
poured out like water on the ground.

115
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,749
All I might have given for love's sake.

116
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,341
Too late.

117
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,265
Died...

118
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,768
slow as a tree.

119
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,106
D'you feel it?

120
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,901
Yes, sir.

121
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,115
Thank you, sir.

122
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,760
Take topside to the signal bridge.

123
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:51,105
The closer you are to Caesar,
the greater the fear.

124
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,409
I just can't help
how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

125
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,122
I can't help it. I got...

126
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,583
My stepdaddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little

127
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,463
and I was scared
and I used to run, I used to hide.

128
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:24,219
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop
a whole lot of nights.

129
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:28,471
And I never thought
it'd get no worse than that.

130
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:33,603
But I'm living by the... by the minute here.
I'm counting the seconds.

131
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:38,153
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon
and there's gonna be air raids.

132
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,654
We're probably gonna die
before we get off the beach.

133
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,739
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.

134
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:50,041
- What's your name, kid?
- I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

135
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,289
- What's your name?
- Edward, Edward B Train.

136
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,459
Train?

137
00:20:55,547 --> 00:21:00,968
The only things that are permanent
is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

138
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:06,972
That's all you gotta worry about. This war
ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

139
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,392
- Think we'll catch an air raid?
- How in the hell should I know?

140
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:15,224
All's I know are them crew guys said
they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

141
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,900
On the other hand,
time before last they nearly got blew up.

142
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,861
What d'you want me to tell you?

143
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,984
You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.

144
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,534
Tell you something.

145
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:30,197
We're sitting out here on this ocean
like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

146
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,247
I already knowthat.

147
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,077
Well, brood on it, Tills.

148
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,458
Brood on it.

149
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,962
- Ain'tyou watching the fun?
- I ain't interested.

150
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,511
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

151
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:47,383
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

152
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,134
Yeah? Well, have fun.

153
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,432
Yeah, have fun.

154
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,348
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore
and run into some of them samurai sabres.

155
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:00,060
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

156
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,027
Open the door!

157
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,695
You all learn to deal these cards...

158
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,402
All right. Here I am sleeping, yeah.

159
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,748
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?

160
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:19,584
All right, jack's high, jackto bet.
Robert's got two jacks.

161
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:27,634
I never bargained for nothing like this when I
signed up for this man's army before the war.

162
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:32,515
How was I supposed to knowthere was
gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

163
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:39,473
All I know is Charlie Company's
always getting screwed. Always.

164
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,320
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

165
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,361
It's that captain of ours.

166
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:49,240
First he gets us stuck off on this boat
where we don't know a fucking soul.

167
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:54,784
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth
place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

168
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:10,548
Hello, Captain.

169
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:58,218
I read in your 201file
that you were an officer before the war.

170
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,972
How'd you end up a private?

171
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,142
Cos of my wife.

172
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,109
I was in the corps of engineers.

173
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,360
We'd never been separated before,

174
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,526
not even for a night.

175
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:17,362
I took it for four months and then I quit.

176
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,369
Just resigned.

177
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,089
They sent me backto the States.

178
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:28,258
They told me
I'd never get another commission.

179
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:34,014
They said they'd see to it I got drafted
and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

180
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,717
Sons of bitches.

181
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,428
No, I don't blame them.

182
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,932
Well, where is she now?

183
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,894
She's home.

184
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,699
Why should I be afraid to die?

185
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,797
I belong to you.

186
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:11,886
Move! Move! Move!

187
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,046
Move! Move!

188
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,433
Move! Move!

189
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,768
Moving out!

190
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:28,021
If I go fiirst, I'll wait for you there.

191
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,770
On the other side of the dark waters.

192
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,157
Put your helmet on.

193
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,368
Be with me now.

194
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,920
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,599
I like you, Captain.

196
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:06,190
And I just wantyou to know, well,
we're in this thing together. All right?

197
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:10,355
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line.
I'll catch up with you there.

198
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,319
- Yes, sir.
- It's all yours, Captain.

199
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,861
Gangway! Gangway there!

200
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,409
Coming through!

201
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,411
Squad leaders! Both teams!

202
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,821
This way, son. This way, right here.

203
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,951
Stand by to go over the side!

204
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,942
Our Father, who art in heaven...

205
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:44,820
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

206
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:48,533
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory.

207
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,305
Your outfit's lucky.

208
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,468
Transports must've been spotted.

209
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:08,478
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

210
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,357
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

211
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,183
- You Charlie Company?
- Yeah.

212
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:55,351
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

213
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,982
Some oil drums.
There'd be nothing there for...

214
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,447
- A week.
- A week, sir.

215
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,987
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

216
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,112
Two mortars hit the beach,
but most guys came in standing up.

217
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,077
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

218
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,120
They got fish that live in trees.

219
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:20,293
If they didn't knowthis beach was deserted,
what else don't they know?

220
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:55,262
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

221
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,753
Your death that captures all.

222
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:40,096
You, too, are the source
of all that's gonna be born.

223
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,334
Your glory.

224
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,714
Mercy.

225
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:15,343
Peace.

226
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,388
Truth.

227
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,318
You give calm a spirit,

228
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,444
understanding,

229
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,323
courage.

230
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:44,080
The contented heart.

231
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,427
Get a medic here!

232
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,193
Maybe all men got one big soul
who everybody's a part of.

233
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,398
All faces of the same man.

234
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,737
One big self.

235
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,073
Everyone lookingfor salvation by himself.

236
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,241
Each like a coal

237
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:33,411
drawn from the fiire.

238
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,287
We're going straight up that hill there.

239
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:16,045
- We can't do that, Colonel.
- Well, there's no way to outflank it.

240
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:19,047
On the left is a cliff
that falls down into the river.

241
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:22,916
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.

242
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:28,056
What about water, sir?
It's not getting up here.

243
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,549
My men are... passing out, sir.

244
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:42,226
Only time you worry about a soldier
is when he stops bitching.

245
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:59,749
We're all gonna attack abreast.
Third Platoon in reserve.

246
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,209
We've gotta cross
those three folds of ground. You see?

247
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:06,089
Once we get beyond that,
we gotta attackthat hill.

248
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:22,934
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it,
so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

249
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,157
- Whyte?
- Yeah?

250
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:29,242
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.

251
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:34,322
When you get to the end of that field,
eliminate all strongpoints on those ridges.

252
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:42,584
I'm sure the Japs got something there
to protect the approaches.

253
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,929
Are you here?

254
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:54,320
Let me not betray you.

255
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,117
Let me not betray my men.

256
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:10,090
In you I place my trust.

257
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,187
Rosy-fingered dawn.

258
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:32,106
You're Greek, aren'tyou, Captain?

259
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,277
D'you ever read Homer?

260
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:36,907
We read Homer at the Point.

261
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,871
In Greek.

262
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,457
What kind of artillery support
do we have, sir? Over.

263
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:47,123
- Two batteries of 105s.
- They won't make a dent. Over.

264
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:51,593
No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

265
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,314
OK, you guys.

266
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,061
This is it.

267
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,644
We're going down in groups of ten.

268
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:57,492
There's no point in going by rushes.
Only make a better target stopped, so...

269
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,903
run all the way.

270
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:03,330
We ain't got no choice.
We're picked, so we gotta go.

271
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,750
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

272
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,164
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

273
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,963
You go organise them guys that's up there.

274
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:21,972
Moving out in five minutes.

275
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,477
Let's go.

276
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,566
Sico?

277
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:34,315
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sickto my stomach.

278
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,740
Sico, you get up now,
or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

279
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:39,618
I can't. I would if I could.

280
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:42,028
I'm sick.

281
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,996
I'm sick.

282
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:46,158
You ain't sick. Get up!

283
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:53,880
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.

284
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:57,134
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

285
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,462
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

286
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,351
- Come on, get up!
- Leave him.

287
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:09,684
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR!
Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

288
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:11,851
Thank you, Sergeant.

289
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:16,230
Don't argue with me.

290
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,399
Good luck, Keck.

291
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:23,839
Plug that hole on your right!

292
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,806
Move!

293
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,572
Maybe they pulled out.

294
00:47:58,295 --> 00:47:59,920
Hit dirt!

295
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:02,248
Hit dirt!

296
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,097
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

297
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:16,934
Stretcher-bearers!

298
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,281
Come on!

299
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:36,449
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

300
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:40,746
- Go get that man.
- We already got eight or nine down there...

301
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,882
- Don't argue with me! Get that man!
- He's not the one we should think about...

302
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:48,252
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?!

303
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:52,425
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
- Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

304
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,516
- I gave you an order, private!
- Yes, sir!

305
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,933
Hello, First Sergeant.

306
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,100
Who we going after over here?

307
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,980
We think it's Jacques.

308
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,192
OI' Jockey.

309
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:12,988
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

310
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,912
Sir?

311
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:20,871
Sir? Sir, can I come backto the company
after we get Jockey backto the battalion?

312
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:25,792
- OK, butyou gotta get permission.
- Sure. And my rifle.

313
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:31,251
Nicky! You're still alive!

314
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,054
Keep moving! Keep moving!

315
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:41,145
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest
thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

316
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:45,727
Beautifully conceived and executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

317
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:48,357
Young Whyte led beautifully.

318
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:50,523
Yes, sir. Over.

319
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:53,492
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

320
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:59,081
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think
they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

321
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,953
Now, how many emplacements
did they locate?

322
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:04,120
Did they knock any out?

323
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:08,257
We ought to have those ridges
cleaned out by noon! Over.

324
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,674
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

325
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:15,005
Here, sir. Over.

326
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:19,974
I said, how many emplacements did they
locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

327
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:22,434
Children.

328
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:25,358
I don't know, sir.

329
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:29,938
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over.

330
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:34,366
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.

331
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:36,776
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

332
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:40,073
No, I can see where you are.
I wantyou to do something.

333
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:43,368
I wantyou to get up there
and see what the situation is.

334
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,702
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

335
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:49,129
Now, goddamn it,
the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

336
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,671
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

337
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:20,112
Move up!

338
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:39,932
Hey, Keck!

339
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:43,017
Yeah!

340
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:46,266
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.

341
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:49,141
Blane's dead.

342
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:51,310
You're in charge.

343
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:57,401
We know you there, Yank!

344
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,278
Tojo eats shit!

345
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:03,615
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

346
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:41,241
I got him! I got him!

347
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,255
I killed a man.

348
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:03,424
Hey, Queen!

349
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:06,016
Queen, you there?

350
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:10,147
Worst thing you can do.
Worse than rape.

351
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:13,186
Queen! You see them Japs
leaving that left ridge?

352
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:17,109
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- I ain't seen nothing.

353
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:20,234
Well, getyour fuckin' head up
and look around!

354
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,783
I'm serious!

355
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:27,785
I counted seven Japs
leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

356
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,368
I got me one of'em.

357
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,705
So?

358
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:34,037
I think maybe they're pulling out.

359
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,756
Maybe somebody
ought to go tell the captain.

360
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,387
You wanna be the one to do it?

361
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:49,842
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

362
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:14,420
Down!

363
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,172
Stay low.

364
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,826
Go! Go!

365
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:56,120
Go! Go!

366
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,996
What do we do now?

367
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:43,253
We wait right here. Maybe
they'll send us up some reinforcements.

368
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:44,802
To do what?

369
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:47,923
To capture some of these
fucking positions around here!

370
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:53,471
- You mean you really wanna go on with this?
- Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

371
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:57,227
If they send us reinforcements,
maybe we could scout around

372
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,392
and locate these machine guns.

373
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:03,482
- Anyway, it's better than going back down.
- Something's coming!

374
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:05,481
They're coming!

375
00:56:10,996 --> 00:56:12,241
What are they doin'?

376
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:15,415
If they want to throw us out,
why didn't they come in force?

377
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,707
Maybe they was acting on their own.

378
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,704
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

379
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:25,090
They're coming.

380
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:36,308
Keck!

381
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,807
Jesus!

382
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:39,974
Oh, Jesus!

383
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:43,234
I blew my butt off!

384
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,736
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!

385
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:48,282
Lay down!

386
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:51,118
What a fucking recruit trickto pull!

387
00:56:51,203 --> 00:56:54,204
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- I grabbed it by the pin!

388
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:59,328
You write my old lady. You tell her...
I want her to know I died like a man.

389
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:01,745
Nobody's gonna have to write her.
You'll make it.

390
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,712
- Don't bullshit me!
- Stay down!

391
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,875
Hey, hey.

392
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:08,760
Have I got mud on my face?

393
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:10,922
Wipe it off. Get it off.

394
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:14,508
No!

395
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:16,677
I'll write her. I promise.

396
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:24,105
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.

397
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:30,983
It's for the best.

398
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:34,157
I'm all messed up down there.

399
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,406
I can't fuck no more.

400
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:43,162
Whoa... Where am I?

401
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:46,291
Where am I?

402
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:51,425
You're gonna be all right.

403
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:55,641
Even if you die,
you didn't letyour brother down.

404
00:57:55,726 --> 00:58:00,435
If you hadn't thrown yourself against
that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

405
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,598
I'm cold.

406
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:07,185
I'm cold.

407
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:10,523
I'm... freezing.

408
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,955
You gonna write his wife?

409
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:11,256
Fuck, no.

410
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:13,753
I don't know his old lady.

411
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:18,889
That's the company commander's job. You
outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

412
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:21,052
You told him you would.

413
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:24,928
I'll say anything to 'em
when they're like that.

414
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:27,648
Somebody ought to do it.

415
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:30,605
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

416
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:42,160
What's wrong, Jim?

417
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:07,247
There's nothing anybody can do for him.
He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

418
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:12,329
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

419
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:15,673
- Would it keep him quiet?
- Not for long, but I can give him two.

420
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:19,175
And I could maybe leave him
three or four for himself.

421
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:23,553
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

422
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:44,111
That's whatyou are.

423
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:48,951
That's all there is for us.
That's us, that's us.

424
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:52,793
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

425
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,921
All twelve of'em.

426
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:57,466
It's insanity up there.

427
01:01:57,551 --> 01:02:01,631
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em
where to go and I gave 'em a push.

428
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:07,060
- Somebody help!
- I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

429
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:11,853
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here,
but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

430
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,980
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

431
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:18,195
I'm outta here. All right, move feet.
Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

432
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,032
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

433
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:25,778
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

434
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:27,863
All right. All right.

435
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:30,910
All right. All right.

436
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:51,059
Somebody help me!

437
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:52,391
Help me!

438
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,271
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

439
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:59,768
- OK. Calm down.
- Fuck you!

440
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:02,948
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

441
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,441
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

442
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:09,288
- How you gonna get me out?
- I'm gonna take you back.

443
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:14,369
- Come on.
- No!

444
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:17,035
Put me down! Put me down!

445
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:25,381
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

446
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:27,839
Please, leave me alone.

447
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:38,351
Give me more. Give me more.

448
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,227
Give me more. Give me more.

449
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:43,480
Give me more. Give me more.

450
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:47,863
Here, Tella.

451
01:03:56,628 --> 01:03:59,250
Goodbye... goodbye.

452
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,211
Bye, kid.

453
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:07,304
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

454
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:27,522
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company
doesn't depend on one man.

455
01:04:32,414 --> 01:04:35,498
Sergeant, I sawthe whole thing
through the glasses.

456
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:39,831
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow
and recommend you for the Silver Star.

457
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:42,543
- It's the most courageous thing...
- Captain,

458
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:46,844
you say one more word to thank me,
I'll knock you right in the teeth.

459
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:50,629
You mention me in your fuckin' orders,
and I'll resign so fast

460
01:04:50,724 --> 01:04:54,769
and leave you here
to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

461
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:58,097
You understand?

462
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:02,564
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

463
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:21,753
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those
men should be reinforced immediately!

464
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,674
What are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses.

465
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:26,834
They're lying behind that ledge!

466
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:30,462
They should be up and out,
cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

467
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:33,473
I don't think you understand
what's going on, sir.

468
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:36,429
We've had... heavy casualties.

469
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:41,396
We had a man... His gut got shot out
on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

470
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:44,650
Fine, fine. Now,
what about those reinforcements? Over.

471
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:48,271
I have... two squads to...

472
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:50,571
First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

473
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:53,067
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

474
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:56,613
Goddamn you, Staros!
When I say reinforcements,

475
01:05:56,707 --> 01:06:01,452
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit
everybody you have there and do it now!

476
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:05,543
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em
lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

477
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:10,674
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to
attack, and move 'em by the flankto the ridge.

478
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:13,550
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

479
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,890
Have 'em press the centre.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!

480
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:18,637
Attack them right now!

481
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:22,513
Jesus, Staros! Do I have to give you
a lesson on infantry tactics

482
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:25,229
while your men
are getting their asses shot off?

483
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:29,067
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand
what is going on here.

484
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:32,359
My company alone
cannot take that position, sir.

485
01:06:32,451 --> 01:06:35,950
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much fire power.

486
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:38,114
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

487
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,576
We can't see it, and it's...
it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

488
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:48,338
I request permission
for patrol reconnaissance around

489
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:52,043
to the right of Hill 210.
I believe the entire position, sir,

490
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:54,759
can be outflanked
with a manoeuvre there in force.

491
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:57,137
- No! Goddamn it, no!
- Might save lives!

492
01:06:57,226 --> 01:06:59,099
There'll be no flanking move.

493
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:02,021
Listen, Staros.
You're not gonna take your men

494
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:05,557
around into the jungle
to avoid a goddamn fight!

495
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:11,191
Do you hear me, Staros? I wantyou to attack
right now with every man atyour disposal!

496
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:14,152
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

497
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:26,498
Sir, I must tell you
that I refuse to obey your order.

498
01:07:40,978 --> 01:07:44,927
- There it is, right there. See it?
- I don't see it.

499
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:48,478
This is notyour fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.

500
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:57,487
I again request permission for patrol
reconnaissance around to the right in force.

501
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:02,446
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

502
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:07,535
I have two witnesses here. I request that
you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

503
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:16,253
Staros, don't pull this
guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

504
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:20,426
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer!
This is not a court of law.

505
01:08:20,517 --> 01:08:22,759
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

506
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:27,729
Now, I want that frontal attack.
I repeat my order. Over.

507
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:31,481
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there
in a frontal attack.

508
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,728
It's suicide, sir.

509
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:38,983
I've lived with these men for two years, and
I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

510
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:50,576
This is a very important decision, Staros.

511
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:58,008
But if youfeel that strongly, maybe
you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

512
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:00,469
Go take a look.

513
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:03,262
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

514
01:09:03,352 --> 01:09:08,179
but if I find extenuating circumstances
when I get there, I'll take that into account.

515
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:12,567
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I wantyou to hold on until I get there.

516
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:16,864
And, if possible, you get those men
on the ridge out and moving! Out.

517
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:32,708
One spot's as good as another, men.

518
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:34,874
There's no place to hide.

519
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:43,884
Just take it easy, son.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

520
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:47,349
Where's... where's Fife?

521
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:49,644
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

522
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:52,353
Hold my hand, Fife.

523
01:09:53,277 --> 01:09:55,353
Hold my hand.

524
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:02,526
I got it.

525
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,616
I'm dying, Fife.

526
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:37,811
Oh, Captain...

527
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:29,159
Shut up in a tomb.

528
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:33,413
Can't lift the lid.

529
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,959
Played a role I never conceived.

530
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:42,254
Get that blouse on, soldier.
It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

531
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,004
Put it on right now.

532
01:11:44,096 --> 01:11:47,465
What you aiming at, son?
Let's go get those son of a bitches.

533
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:49,634
Move up!

534
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:03,151
What are you doing laying down there
where you can't see a damn thing?

535
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:12,031
Observing, sir. Just sent
First Platoon forward to the ridge.

536
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:15,742
- How many of'em were hit this time?
- None, sir.

537
01:12:15,836 --> 01:12:17,912
None? Not one?

538
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:22,872
Doesn't sound like the situation
you described to me over the sound power.

539
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:27,547
Well, it's not. The situation's changed
just in the last five minutes, sir.

540
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:33,177
Captain, you listen to me.

541
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,891
We're going over there
and taking everybody with us.

542
01:12:35,981 --> 01:12:38,472
Do you have any more complaints
or demurrers?

543
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:43,235
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right! We're gonna do things my way!

544
01:12:43,322 --> 01:12:45,729
My way! You understand that, Captain?

545
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:50,118
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!

546
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:54,071
I thinkthe ridge
is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

547
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:03,747
Show me howto see things the way you do.

548
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:09,296
Show me howto see things the way you do.

549
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:15,762
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

550
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:41,869
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

551
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:45,214
Bell, take six men

552
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,376
and go see what's up there.

553
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:55,802
And we'll cover you the best we can
from down there.

554
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:16,974
OK.

555
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:19,550
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

556
01:15:20,687 --> 01:15:22,763
I'm going alone.

557
01:17:02,372 --> 01:17:04,448
Come out.

558
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:11,872
Come out where I am.

559
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:23,077
There was a... There was a...

560
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:27,076
There's a bunker... up there.

561
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,993
It's five guns.

562
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:33,625
It's five guns.

563
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:42,927
That strongpoint up there,
somewhere up there around those rocks,

564
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:45,091
is the key to this ridge.

565
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:50,309
Bell here is quite right.

566
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:56,103
From their knob up there, those little brown
brothers can cover the whole of the ground

567
01:18:56,195 --> 01:19:00,524
in front of this position for 1,000 yards.
They've left this ledge unguarded.

568
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:04,565
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.
That's a hell of a mistake.

569
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:08,825
We need to take advantage of it
before they see their error.

570
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:14,703
All right, all right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted,

571
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:18,248
and we've had a hell of a time
getting water up here.

572
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:22,052
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

573
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:27,842
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.

574
01:19:30,687 --> 01:19:33,013
So I'm asking for volunteers.

575
01:19:33,106 --> 01:19:35,348
Go back up there and knock it out.

576
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,518
Sir?

577
01:19:37,611 --> 01:19:39,687
I'll be glad to go back up

578
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,105
- and lead the way back for a party.
- Right.

579
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:43,907
- I'll go, sir.
- You.

580
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,118
All right.

581
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:51,031
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
- All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

582
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:54,042
- You'll be in command.
- I'll go, sir.

583
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:55,503
- Sir?
- You.

584
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:59,585
All right, men, that's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.

585
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:07,883
I don't know if you realise the importance
of this operation, Staros.

586
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:12,475
Once our position is secured,
we can move the bombers in.

587
01:20:12,563 --> 01:20:16,512
That means air power
for 1,000 miles in every direction.

588
01:20:17,943 --> 01:20:21,063
Guadalcanal may be
the turning point in the war.

589
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:25,780
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.

590
01:20:28,912 --> 01:20:31,913
I explained to you
the importance of this objective.

591
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:35,202
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?

592
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:37,370
I can't say, sir.

593
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:48,505
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives
of any of your men in this campaign?

594
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:52,969
How many? One? Two?

595
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:56,347
Twenty?

596
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:00,686
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

597
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:06,400
And if you don't have the stomach for it,
now is the time to let me know.

598
01:21:07,284 --> 01:21:11,198
No, sir. You're right...
about everything you said.

599
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:13,364
Fine, fine.

600
01:21:13,457 --> 01:21:15,533
That's all, Captain.

601
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:19,328
One more thing, Staros.

602
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:24,382
It's not necessary for you
to ever tell me thatyou think I'm right.

603
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:26,628
Ever.

604
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,045
We'll assume it.

605
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:31,013
Dismissed.

606
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,817
I feel sorry for you, kid.

607
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:53,279
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.

608
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,826
This army's gonna kill you.

609
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:08,294
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself.
There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

610
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:12,550
You're just running into a burning house
where nobody can be saved.

611
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:30,231
What difference do you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.

612
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:38,197
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

613
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:46,999
There's not some other world out there
where everything's gonna be OK.

614
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,168
There's just this one.

615
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:53,172
Just this rock.

616
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:32,626
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

617
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:35,841
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

618
01:23:35,933 --> 01:23:38,637
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

619
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:42,597
This is futile!

620
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:49,143
Look at me!
I stand right up here and not one bullet.

621
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:51,314
Not one shot!

622
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:54,114
Why?

623
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:56,485
How come they all had to die?

624
01:23:56,578 --> 01:24:01,039
I can stand right here, I can stand right up
and nothing happens to me!

625
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,596
We.

626
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:32,230
We together.

627
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,034
One being.

628
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:02,347
Flow together like water,

629
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:07,936
till I can't tell youfrom me.

630
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:27,910
I drink you.

631
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:32,039
Now.

632
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:36,460
Now.

633
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:15,166
You're my light.

634
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:20,504
My guide.

635
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,998
John, I'll be behind you.
If you wanna breakthrough, we'll come after.

636
01:27:33,086 --> 01:27:35,624
We'll charge atyour whistle signal.

637
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:38,872
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

638
01:29:33,207 --> 01:29:35,283
OK.

639
01:29:36,293 --> 01:29:38,962
Stay down, belowthis ledge,

640
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:43,043
and I'll call down the data from above.

641
01:29:43,133 --> 01:29:47,712
Once the 81s have plastered that rock...
as much as possible,

642
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:51,588
we're gonna crawl out
along that big rock for cover

643
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:55,177
and then flank 'em to the right.

644
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:57,144
OK?

645
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:01,222
OK. OK.

646
01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:26,500
Azimuth 1470... from Easy Roger 7.

647
01:30:27,386 --> 01:30:29,711
100 left, add 200.

648
01:30:29,805 --> 01:30:32,474
Uncle Baker 1, fire mission.

649
01:30:32,558 --> 01:30:35,558
Azimuth 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

650
01:30:35,644 --> 01:30:38,847
Left 100, add 200.

651
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:42,808
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.

652
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:45,653
Understand. 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

653
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:02,119
Left 25, drop 50!

654
01:31:03,297 --> 01:31:05,373
Left 25, Uncle Baker 1.

655
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:07,754
Left 25, drop 50.

656
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:09,919
Fire for effect. Over.

657
01:31:10,179 --> 01:31:12,255
Roger, Uncle Baker 1.

658
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,280
Let's go!

659
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,136
OK, we're gonna continue on
up the hill to the right.

660
01:31:55,224 --> 01:31:59,471
Nobody fire or throwthe grenades
till I give the signal.

661
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:01,637
OK, let's do it.

662
01:32:16,286 --> 01:32:19,240
Is he OK? Is he all right?

663
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:21,703
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

664
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:25,836
- No, we can't leave him here.
- He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

665
01:32:25,921 --> 01:32:29,919
We can leave him and pick him up
on the way back,... if he's still alive.

666
01:32:33,804 --> 01:32:36,211
- Is he dead?
- Notyet.

667
01:32:36,306 --> 01:32:39,889
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!

668
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:05,705
Behind you!

669
01:33:21,143 --> 01:33:23,219
We're pinned down!

670
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:55,209
Fall back!

671
01:34:00,182 --> 01:34:01,641
Go!

672
01:35:12,754 --> 01:35:14,830
Watch out.

673
01:35:53,462 --> 01:35:54,921
Clear!

674
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:49,217
Come on. Get out.

675
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:52,678
Go on.

676
01:36:55,649 --> 01:36:57,725
Think you're soldiers?

677
01:37:04,741 --> 01:37:06,983
You piece of shit!

678
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:15,124
Son of a bitch!

679
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:17,286
Son of a bitch!

680
01:37:36,315 --> 01:37:38,391
All right?

681
01:37:41,153 --> 01:37:43,229
I shot a man.

682
01:38:18,482 --> 01:38:20,558
Stinks around here.

683
01:38:21,777 --> 01:38:25,312
- All these dead people.
- Put a cigarette up your nose.

684
01:39:47,446 --> 01:39:49,901
Look at 'em move!

685
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:51,733
Look at 'em move!

686
01:39:51,825 --> 01:39:53,699
We got 'em on the run!

687
01:39:53,785 --> 01:39:56,989
Way to go, John. When they saw you
make that attack and win,

688
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,618
you put their hearts back into them.

689
01:39:59,708 --> 01:40:01,914
- Hey, hey!
- Don't do that, soldier.

690
01:40:02,002 --> 01:40:06,794
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them.
There'll be somebody around before long.

691
01:40:06,882 --> 01:40:09,337
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

692
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:12,178
Sir, I've a few recommendations
for decorations.

693
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:15,797
Yes. We'll get everything for all of'em
that we can, but later.

694
01:40:15,891 --> 01:40:20,352
Meantime, I wantyou to know I'm personally
recommending you for something, John.

695
01:40:20,437 --> 01:40:21,896
Perhaps the big one.

696
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:25,065
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel...
- Yes, you do, John.

697
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:27,985
Getting it for you
will be the goddamn problem!

698
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:32,482
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion
and the regiment, if you did get it.

699
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:34,234
We better move out.

700
01:40:34,326 --> 01:40:38,869
We need to extend our lines, hook up with
the other companies and push on to the top.

701
01:40:38,956 --> 01:40:41,910
Would you like to take command
of Baker Company?

702
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,032
Of course.

703
01:40:43,126 --> 01:40:47,753
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket,
but about the water. If we don't get water...

704
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,916
Don't worry about water.

705
01:40:51,426 --> 01:40:56,669
John, I don't want anything to break up this
attack of ours now we have the momentum.

706
01:40:56,765 --> 01:41:00,300
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

707
01:41:00,394 --> 01:41:02,470
I've arranged for that.

708
01:41:03,105 --> 01:41:06,604
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it,
and wait for it.

709
01:41:06,692 --> 01:41:08,565
No, sir.

710
01:41:08,652 --> 01:41:10,858
That's right.

711
01:41:10,946 --> 01:41:16,735
And if some of the men... pass out,
why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

712
01:41:20,539 --> 01:41:22,413
All right.

713
01:41:22,499 --> 01:41:23,958
They could...

714
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:27,376
- They could die from it.
- They could die from enemy fire, too!

715
01:41:28,714 --> 01:41:31,002
They're all tough boys.

716
01:41:35,762 --> 01:41:40,887
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see
plenty more of those where we're going!

717
01:41:40,976 --> 01:41:43,549
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

718
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:51,391
John, I'm convinced that
the Japanese position can be broken now.

719
01:41:51,486 --> 01:41:56,563
All we have to do is keep going and we'll
have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

720
01:41:56,658 --> 01:41:59,659
You see the spirit in these men?
D'you see the new spirit?

721
01:41:59,745 --> 01:42:04,905
Well, I want to take advantage of that before
something happens to sap their strength.

722
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,871
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

723
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:11,626
or even to have it reinforced
from troops from the reserves,

724
01:42:11,715 --> 01:42:14,882
if we were to stall
before reaching the top, well,

725
01:42:14,968 --> 01:42:19,215
Jesus Christ, that's just
a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

726
01:42:19,306 --> 01:42:21,678
I've waited all my life for this.

727
01:42:21,767 --> 01:42:26,310
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold
buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

728
01:42:26,396 --> 01:42:28,852
And I don't intend to give it up now.

729
01:42:32,027 --> 01:42:35,692
You don't know what it feels like
to be passed over.

730
01:42:35,781 --> 01:42:38,947
I mean, you're young.
You're just out of the Academy.

731
01:42:39,034 --> 01:42:44,704
You're, you know, you've gotyour war!
This 15 years, this is my first war!

732
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:53,504
John, some day you'll understand.

733
01:42:59,388 --> 01:43:01,464
You're like a son to me, John.

734
01:43:03,851 --> 01:43:05,927
You know what my son does?

735
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:08,930
He's a bait salesman.

736
01:43:11,525 --> 01:43:13,601
You've done a hell of a job, John.

737
01:43:13,694 --> 01:43:18,521
I'm gonna make sure thatyou get everything,
everything thatyou deserve.

738
01:43:20,784 --> 01:43:22,860
Thank you, sir.

739
01:43:24,955 --> 01:43:27,031
God...

740
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:30,574
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

741
01:43:30,669 --> 01:43:32,329
Get me three runners!

742
01:43:32,421 --> 01:43:34,663
You go backto the rear to find water

743
01:43:34,756 --> 01:43:37,627
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

744
01:43:38,552 --> 01:43:41,755
We attack in one hour!
We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

745
01:43:41,847 --> 01:43:44,338
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

746
01:43:44,433 --> 01:43:46,509
It's high ground by nightfall!

747
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:13,205
You seen many dead people?

748
01:44:14,004 --> 01:44:15,961
Plenty.

749
01:44:16,048 --> 01:44:18,669
They're no different than dead dogs,

750
01:44:19,384 --> 01:44:21,460
once you get used to the idea.

751
01:44:26,308 --> 01:44:28,384
They're meat, kid.

752
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:47,405
Are you righteous? Kind?

753
01:44:50,499 --> 01:44:52,657
Does your confiidence lie in this?

754
01:44:56,088 --> 01:44:58,164
Are you loved by all?

755
01:45:00,467 --> 01:45:02,543
Know that I was, too.

756
01:45:06,139 --> 01:45:10,801
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less
because you loved goodness?

757
01:45:11,436 --> 01:45:13,512
Truth?

758
01:49:11,844 --> 01:49:15,047
Get fucking on the ground!
Get down! Get down!

759
01:49:15,806 --> 01:49:17,882
Get down. Stay there.

760
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:30,225
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

761
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,194
Now!

762
01:50:31,882 --> 01:50:33,958
This great evil.

763
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,796
Where's it come from?

764
01:50:43,477 --> 01:50:45,553
How'd it steal into the world?

765
01:50:57,324 --> 01:51:00,859
What seed, what root did it growfrom?

766
01:51:05,791 --> 01:51:07,867
Who's doing this?

767
01:51:10,462 --> 01:51:12,538
Who's killing us?

768
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:19,001
Robbing us of life and light.

769
01:51:23,767 --> 01:51:27,183
Mocking us with the sight
of what we might have known.

770
01:51:53,172 --> 01:51:55,876
Does our ruin benefiit the Earth?

771
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:01,878
Does it help the grass to grow
or the sun to shine?

772
01:52:08,061 --> 01:52:10,350
Is this darkness in you, too?

773
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:19,145
Have you passed through this night?

774
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:27,908
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

775
01:52:31,627 --> 01:52:33,703
You're dying.

776
01:52:45,641 --> 01:52:47,717
See them birds up there?

777
01:52:49,478 --> 01:52:51,767
You knowthey eatyou raw?

778
01:52:56,693 --> 01:52:59,860
Where you're going,
you're not coming back from.

779
01:54:11,351 --> 01:54:13,427
What are you to me?

780
01:54:19,234 --> 01:54:21,310
Nothing.

781
01:56:42,503 --> 01:56:44,579
Have a seat here.

782
01:56:54,848 --> 01:56:57,635
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

783
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:03,393
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

784
01:57:05,108 --> 01:57:07,184
I already told him.

785
01:57:17,579 --> 01:57:19,868
It's a hard thing to do.

786
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:22,742
Difficult decision to make.

787
01:57:25,879 --> 01:57:28,038
I don't think you're tough enough.

788
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:34,544
You're too soft. You're just too softhearted.
You're not tough-fibred enough.

789
01:57:39,101 --> 01:57:43,051
Anyway, it's my decision to make.
I've already made it.

790
01:57:43,772 --> 01:57:46,263
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

791
01:57:54,533 --> 01:57:57,736
Have you ever had anyone
die in your arms, sir?

792
01:57:57,828 --> 01:58:00,117
Have you?

793
01:58:12,759 --> 01:58:15,713
I don't see any reason
to make a scandal out of this.

794
01:58:15,804 --> 01:58:21,225
I don't want it in the records of the battalion.
There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

795
01:58:21,310 --> 01:58:24,892
This has nothing to do with
cowardice or inefficiency.

796
01:58:28,192 --> 01:58:30,480
Look at this jungle.

797
01:58:30,569 --> 01:58:35,908
Look at those vines, the way they twine
around the trees, swallowing everything.

798
01:58:38,327 --> 01:58:40,615
Nature's cruel, Staros.

799
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:55,420
I'm going to letyou apply for reassignment
to the Judge Advocate General Corps

800
01:58:55,511 --> 01:58:57,384
for reasons of ill health.

801
01:58:57,471 --> 01:58:58,846
You're a lawyer.

802
01:58:58,931 --> 01:59:01,303
- You had malaria yet?
- No, I haven't.

803
01:59:01,391 --> 01:59:03,764
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

804
01:59:03,852 --> 01:59:06,094
Anyway, you probably will have it.

805
01:59:06,772 --> 01:59:09,808
I'm also recommending you
for the Silver Star.

806
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:14,063
And I'll recommend it in such a way
it definitely won't be refused.

807
01:59:14,988 --> 01:59:17,610
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

808
01:59:20,285 --> 01:59:21,945
Why?

809
01:59:22,037 --> 01:59:27,660
Because of that scratch on your face
and because of those cuts on your hands.

810
01:59:27,751 --> 01:59:29,411
Listen to me, Staros.

811
01:59:29,503 --> 01:59:33,548
I think it's bestyou go back with
the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

812
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:37,416
It is no goddamn good for you
to keep hanging around.

813
01:59:37,511 --> 01:59:41,046
The quieter we keep this,
the better it'll be for all.

814
02:00:15,716 --> 02:00:17,958
This is from Colonel Tall.

815
02:00:19,469 --> 02:00:22,969
"Our victory gives us
the highest reasons for pride."

816
02:00:24,057 --> 02:00:27,592
"It will prove a milestone
in the battle for Guadalcanal."

817
02:00:28,937 --> 02:00:33,932
"Tomorrow the division commander
will arrive to make an inspection of the line."

818
02:00:34,026 --> 02:00:39,268
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a
battalion of the division's reserve regiment."

819
02:00:40,741 --> 02:00:44,988
"I've secured for the battalion
a week's rest off the line."

820
02:00:49,249 --> 02:00:50,708
That's all.

821
02:02:46,116 --> 02:02:48,192
Hours like months.

822
02:02:50,954 --> 02:02:53,030
Days like years.

823
02:02:56,376 --> 02:02:58,452
Walked into the golden age.

824
02:03:02,424 --> 02:03:04,997
Stood on the shores of the New World.

825
02:03:15,938 --> 02:03:18,892
I would've come by
and paid you guys a visit,

826
02:03:18,982 --> 02:03:20,642
but...

827
02:03:23,779 --> 02:03:26,400
I just felt like being alone, you know?

828
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,276
Yeah?

829
02:03:40,462 --> 02:03:42,538
We wanted to thank you, sir.

830
02:03:46,593 --> 02:03:49,084
For asking to make that flanking move.

831
02:03:51,181 --> 02:03:53,257
For watching out for us.

832
02:03:55,310 --> 02:03:57,386
Keeping us together.

833
02:04:02,568 --> 02:04:04,644
We're all sorry to see you go.

834
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:06,895
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

835
02:04:09,157 --> 02:04:12,324
Well, I'm not sure thatyou're right.

836
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:16,954
Tough part is...

837
02:04:18,876 --> 02:04:21,331
not knowing if you're doing any good.

838
02:04:23,213 --> 02:04:25,289
That's the hard part.

839
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:29,672
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

840
02:04:30,512 --> 02:04:32,588
I'm glad to be going.

841
02:04:33,849 --> 02:04:35,806
I'm glad.

842
02:04:35,893 --> 02:04:39,677
- There's still time. We could file a complaint.
- For what?

843
02:04:40,772 --> 02:04:43,014
What good would that do?

844
02:04:44,735 --> 02:04:46,395
Anyway, I wanna go.

845
02:04:49,323 --> 02:04:51,778
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

846
02:05:04,379 --> 02:05:06,455
What does that mean, sir?

847
02:05:09,176 --> 02:05:11,501
It means "You've been like my sons".

848
02:05:22,773 --> 02:05:24,849
You are my sons.

849
02:05:26,109 --> 02:05:28,185
My dear sons.

850
02:05:32,074 --> 02:05:34,150
You live inside me now.

851
02:05:38,163 --> 02:05:40,239
I'll carry you wherever I go.

852
02:05:56,265 --> 02:05:59,052
Can't nothing make youforget it.

853
02:06:02,771 --> 02:06:05,262
Each time you start from scratch.

854
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:13,692
War don't ennoble men.

855
02:06:14,741 --> 02:06:17,030
It turns 'em into dogs.

856
02:06:22,833 --> 02:06:24,909
Poisons the soul.

857
02:07:28,899 --> 02:07:30,975
My dear wife,

858
02:07:33,737 --> 02:07:40,321
you get something twisted out of your
insides by all this blood, fiilth, and noise.

859
02:07:49,795 --> 02:07:52,416
I wanna stay changeless for you.

860
02:07:55,008 --> 02:07:58,009
I wanna come back to you
the man I was before.

861
02:08:06,019 --> 02:08:08,724
How do we get to those other shores?

862
02:08:12,568 --> 02:08:14,644
To those blue hills.

863
02:08:24,872 --> 02:08:26,532
Love.

864
02:08:36,091 --> 02:08:38,167
Where does it come from?

865
02:08:46,602 --> 02:08:48,678
Who lit this flame in us?

866
02:08:55,736 --> 02:08:57,812
No war can put it out,

867
02:08:59,323 --> 02:09:01,399
conquer it.

868
02:09:09,249 --> 02:09:11,325
I was a prisoner.

869
02:09:15,797 --> 02:09:17,873
You set me free.

870
02:09:22,012 --> 02:09:24,550
No matter how much training you got,

871
02:09:25,682 --> 02:09:27,758
how careful you are,

872
02:09:29,144 --> 02:09:32,596
it's a matter of luck
whether or notyou get killed.

873
02:09:32,689 --> 02:09:37,932
Makes no difference who you are,
or howtough a guy you might be,

874
02:09:39,988 --> 02:09:44,401
if you're in the wrong spot
at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

875
02:09:55,128 --> 02:09:57,584
I look at that boy dying,

876
02:09:59,091 --> 02:10:01,167
I don't feel nothing.

877
02:10:04,429 --> 02:10:07,099
I don't care about nothing any more.

878
02:10:11,770 --> 02:10:13,846
Sounds like bliss.

879
02:10:18,318 --> 02:10:20,394
I don't have that feeling yet.

880
02:10:21,822 --> 02:10:23,898
That numbness.

881
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:27,026
Not like the rest of you guys.

882
02:10:31,373 --> 02:10:33,662
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

883
02:10:36,879 --> 02:10:39,120
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

884
02:11:22,925 --> 02:11:26,424
I haven't touched another woman
since I was called up.

885
02:11:27,513 --> 02:11:29,589
Or talked to one.

886
02:11:33,602 --> 02:11:35,678
I don't wanna...

887
02:11:36,396 --> 02:11:38,934
I don't wanna feel the desire.

888
02:12:16,019 --> 02:12:17,679
All right. Abrahams!

889
02:12:17,771 --> 02:12:19,431
Abrahams. Here you go.

890
02:12:19,523 --> 02:12:21,397
Stack! Where's Stack?

891
02:12:21,483 --> 02:12:23,523
Bring him out.

892
02:12:23,610 --> 02:12:25,686
Bell?

893
02:12:25,779 --> 02:12:27,653
Bell!

894
02:12:28,699 --> 02:12:31,190
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

895
02:12:33,954 --> 02:12:36,030
Dear Jack,

896
02:12:37,833 --> 02:12:42,993
I've met an Air Force captain.
I've fallen in love with him.

897
02:12:45,716 --> 02:12:48,004
I want a divorce to marry him.

898
02:12:54,349 --> 02:12:57,932
I know you can say no,
but I'm asking you anyway,

899
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:00,807
out of the memory of what we had together.

900
02:13:07,571 --> 02:13:09,647
Forgive me.

901
02:13:10,616 --> 02:13:13,189
It just got too lonely, Jack.

902
02:13:33,514 --> 02:13:35,590
We'll meet again some day.

903
02:13:39,394 --> 02:13:43,344
People who have been as close as we've been
always meet again.

904
02:13:51,823 --> 02:13:54,659
I have no right to speak to you this way.

905
02:13:54,743 --> 02:13:57,032
I can't stop myself.

906
02:13:57,538 --> 02:13:59,614
A habit so strong.

907
02:14:01,792 --> 02:14:04,413
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

908
02:14:08,549 --> 02:14:10,625
Help me leave you!

909
02:15:37,888 --> 02:15:39,964
What's your name?

910
02:16:52,004 --> 02:16:54,080
We were a family.

911
02:16:57,342 --> 02:16:59,916
How'd it break up and come apart?

912
02:17:03,182 --> 02:17:06,681
So that now we're turned against each other.

913
02:17:08,562 --> 02:17:11,135
Each standing in the other's light.

914
02:17:20,365 --> 02:17:22,987
How did we lose the good that was given us?

915
02:17:24,786 --> 02:17:26,862
Let it slip away?

916
02:17:29,666 --> 02:17:31,742
Scatter it careless?

917
02:17:52,439 --> 02:17:54,847
What's keeping us from reaching out?

918
02:17:55,484 --> 02:17:57,560
Touching the glory?

919
02:17:59,613 --> 02:18:03,361
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,

920
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:05,526
long ago.

921
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:09,196
They leave you here?

922
02:18:10,749 --> 02:18:12,208
Yup.

923
02:18:12,292 --> 02:18:14,368
I slowed 'em up.

924
02:18:15,045 --> 02:18:16,954
Don't mind, really.

925
02:18:17,965 --> 02:18:20,752
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

926
02:18:20,884 --> 02:18:22,960
I got plenty of ammo.

927
02:18:25,639 --> 02:18:28,260
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

928
02:18:33,355 --> 02:18:35,644
- They gotyou good.
- Right in the knee.

929
02:18:35,732 --> 02:18:37,440
Yeah.

930
02:18:37,526 --> 02:18:40,099
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

931
02:18:45,409 --> 02:18:48,991
- Whatyou doin' down here?
- Just, you know,

932
02:18:49,079 --> 02:18:51,368
I'm heading backto the company.

933
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:53,700
Yeah.

934
02:18:54,543 --> 02:18:56,832
Well, you give all them boys my best.

935
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:59,376
You can come with me if you want.

936
02:18:59,464 --> 02:19:01,587
I'll help you along.

937
02:19:03,218 --> 02:19:05,792
No, it's nice and quiet.

938
02:19:05,888 --> 02:19:07,964
Peaceful up here.

939
02:19:10,350 --> 02:19:13,517
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.

940
02:19:17,399 --> 02:19:19,475
I'll remind 'em.

941
02:19:19,943 --> 02:19:22,019
OK.

942
02:20:57,249 --> 02:20:59,325
Hey, Witt.

943
02:21:03,881 --> 02:21:06,039
Who you making trouble for today?

944
02:21:07,092 --> 02:21:09,168
What d'you mean?

945
02:21:09,928 --> 02:21:13,095
Well, isn't that whatyou like to do?

946
02:21:13,182 --> 02:21:15,851
Turn left when they say go right?

947
02:21:22,649 --> 02:21:25,140
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

948
02:21:27,571 --> 02:21:30,109
You care about me, don'tyou, Sergeant?

949
02:21:31,491 --> 02:21:33,568
I always felt like you did.

950
02:21:35,412 --> 02:21:38,117
Why do you always
make yourself out like a rock?

951
02:21:39,416 --> 02:21:41,788
One day I can come up and talkto you,

952
02:21:42,836 --> 02:21:46,704
by the next day it's like we never even met.

953
02:22:01,063 --> 02:22:03,139
Lonely house now.

954
02:22:05,817 --> 02:22:07,894
You ever get Ionely?

955
02:22:07,986 --> 02:22:10,062
Only around people.

956
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:14,066
Only around people.

957
02:22:18,705 --> 02:22:22,121
You still believing in the beautiful light,
are you?

958
02:22:29,716 --> 02:22:31,792
How do you do that?

959
02:22:33,470 --> 02:22:35,546
You're a magician to me.

960
02:22:44,606 --> 02:22:46,682
I still see a spark in you.

961
02:23:11,967 --> 02:23:17,507
One man looks at a dying bird and
thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

962
02:23:20,225 --> 02:23:22,301
But death's got the fiinal word.

963
02:23:25,397 --> 02:23:27,473
It's laughing at him.

964
02:23:36,783 --> 02:23:39,274
Another man sees that same bird,

965
02:23:42,206 --> 02:23:44,282
feels the glory.

966
02:23:49,338 --> 02:23:51,829
Feels something smiling through him.

967
02:24:49,147 --> 02:24:51,603
We need to get out of here right now.

968
02:24:51,692 --> 02:24:56,270
- You explain to... headquarters the situation?
- No.

969
02:24:56,363 --> 02:25:00,443
Do they know where we are?
Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

970
02:25:01,618 --> 02:25:05,153
Well, I thinkthat's...
up to me to judge, Sergeant.

971
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:12,377
I think we just need to send somebody
up there and find out how close they are. OK?

972
02:25:12,462 --> 02:25:14,336
It's easy.

973
02:25:14,423 --> 02:25:17,792
Hey, Weld...
get headquarters on that thing.

974
02:25:17,885 --> 02:25:19,794
The fire's coming closer, sir.

975
02:25:19,887 --> 02:25:20,918
Line's cut!

976
02:25:23,932 --> 02:25:28,096
We need to send somebody out there
to find out where that line is being cut.

977
02:25:28,187 --> 02:25:30,808
And we need to find out how close they are.

978
02:25:30,898 --> 02:25:32,440
Come on.

979
02:25:32,524 --> 02:25:35,062
OK. OK.

980
02:25:39,198 --> 02:25:41,274
Hey, you.

981
02:25:41,909 --> 02:25:43,154
You go.

982
02:25:44,161 --> 02:25:45,821
You're going, Fife.

983
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:54,461
Coombs. You go, too.

984
02:25:54,546 --> 02:25:56,206
Come on!

985
02:25:56,298 --> 02:26:00,841
I'll go. I wantyou to know
I thinkthe whole thing's a bad idea, though.

986
02:26:00,928 --> 02:26:05,969
If they come down here in any strength,
Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

987
02:26:06,058 --> 02:26:08,513
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

988
02:26:08,602 --> 02:26:13,727
No, I wanna go, sir. In case
something bad happens, I wanna be there.

989
02:26:13,815 --> 02:26:16,307
All right. You stay by the river.

990
02:26:16,401 --> 02:26:19,319
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

991
02:26:19,404 --> 02:26:21,480
I will.

992
02:26:21,573 --> 02:26:23,530
Good luck, Witt.

993
02:26:23,617 --> 02:26:25,740
You OK, Fife?

994
02:27:52,873 --> 02:27:55,494
A reinforce battalion.

995
02:27:57,085 --> 02:27:58,745
We need to go back.

996
02:27:58,837 --> 02:28:00,711
Tell the lieutenant.

997
02:28:04,510 --> 02:28:06,383
Let's go.

998
02:28:23,654 --> 02:28:25,730
I'm hit!

999
02:29:24,673 --> 02:29:27,460
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

1000
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:36,676
We'll be all right.

1001
02:29:41,690 --> 02:29:44,691
My friend here doesn't have long,

1002
02:29:44,776 --> 02:29:47,694
so... you go.

1003
02:29:48,906 --> 02:29:50,364
You go on ahead.

1004
02:30:13,597 --> 02:30:15,673
Witt!

1005
02:31:01,478 --> 02:31:03,554
They're coming.

1006
02:31:05,023 --> 02:31:08,357
I gotta go. I don't wantyou to be afraid.

1007
02:31:09,111 --> 02:31:13,274
Just hide out here till you hear firing,
then push on down the river.

1008
02:31:13,365 --> 02:31:14,824
No.

1009
02:31:55,073 --> 02:31:58,739
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back, they're coming.

1010
02:31:59,703 --> 02:32:01,779
Fall back.

1011
02:32:03,290 --> 02:32:05,828
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1012
02:32:12,049 --> 02:32:14,125
Fife, where's Witt?

1013
02:32:17,846 --> 02:32:20,847
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1014
02:34:04,161 --> 02:34:06,035
America.

1015
02:36:55,249 --> 02:36:57,325
Where's your spark now?

1016
02:37:20,065 --> 02:37:24,145
Now, I know you men have been
making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1017
02:37:24,236 --> 02:37:25,481
That's OK by me.

1018
02:37:25,571 --> 02:37:27,279
Everything a lie.

1019
02:37:27,364 --> 02:37:31,029
Any man in my outfit
can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1020
02:37:31,118 --> 02:37:33,241
Everything you hear and see.

1021
02:37:33,328 --> 02:37:37,492
As long as he's in shape to make reveille
and carry out any assignment given.

1022
02:37:37,583 --> 02:37:41,450
If he can't do that,
he's gonna have trouble from me.

1023
02:37:41,545 --> 02:37:45,377
- So much to spew out.
- I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1024
02:37:45,465 --> 02:37:48,669
and that's what we all are here,
whether we like it or not.

1025
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:50,836
We are a family.

1026
02:37:51,930 --> 02:37:54,089
I'm the father.

1027
02:37:54,766 --> 02:37:57,851
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1028
02:37:57,936 --> 02:38:00,641
They just keep coming, one after another.

1029
02:38:00,731 --> 02:38:04,016
That makes you all the children in this family.

1030
02:38:04,109 --> 02:38:07,644
Now, a family can have only one head,
and that is the father.

1031
02:38:07,738 --> 02:38:12,400
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.

1032
02:38:12,492 --> 02:38:16,193
- If any of you wanna see me about anything,
- You're in a box.

1033
02:38:16,288 --> 02:38:18,411
- anything at all,
- A moving box.

1034
02:38:18,498 --> 02:38:20,575
you will find that I am available.

1035
02:38:20,667 --> 02:38:23,621
This war is not gonna be over
by next Christmas.

1036
02:38:23,712 --> 02:38:26,666
It's gonna be a long time
before we get home...

1037
02:38:26,757 --> 02:38:28,833
They wantyou dead.

1038
02:38:31,220 --> 02:38:33,296
Or in their lie.

1039
02:38:38,519 --> 02:38:40,595
Only one thing a man can do.

1040
02:38:43,607 --> 02:38:45,683
Find something that's his.

1041
02:38:48,946 --> 02:38:51,022
Make an islandfor himself.

1042
02:39:04,503 --> 02:39:06,994
If I never meetyou in this life,

1043
02:39:08,423 --> 02:39:10,499
let me feel the lack.

1044
02:39:19,059 --> 02:39:23,472
A glance from your eyes,
and my life will be yours.

1045
02:40:12,613 --> 02:40:16,657
Somethin' I can come backto.
Some kind of foundation.

1046
02:40:16,825 --> 02:40:21,404
I mean, I don't know what, you know,
what your plans are, but...

1047
02:40:21,496 --> 02:40:25,446
I'm determined now.
I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1048
02:40:25,542 --> 02:40:28,876
You know, I may be young,
but I've lived plenty of life.

1049
02:40:29,588 --> 02:40:31,830
I'm ready to start living it good.

1050
02:40:31,924 --> 02:40:36,882
You know, my daddy always told me it's
gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1051
02:40:36,970 --> 02:40:41,513
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be
that hard when you're young.

1052
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:45,265
Well, I figure after this
the worst is gonna be gone.

1053
02:40:45,979 --> 02:40:49,562
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.

1054
02:40:50,567 --> 02:40:52,643
That's what's gonna happen.

1055
02:40:53,779 --> 02:40:55,855
I'm getting older now.

1056
02:40:56,698 --> 02:40:59,189
By no means old, but older.

1057
02:40:59,993 --> 02:41:03,160
Where is it that we were together?

1058
02:41:06,333 --> 02:41:08,622
Who were you that I lived with?

1059
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:15,416
Walked with?

1060
02:41:22,558 --> 02:41:24,634
The brother.

1061
02:41:31,149 --> 02:41:33,226
The friend.

1062
02:41:59,553 --> 02:42:01,629
Darkness from light.

1063
02:42:03,140 --> 02:42:05,216
Strife from love.

1064
02:42:06,393 --> 02:42:09,513
Are they the workings of one mind?

1065
02:42:10,898 --> 02:42:13,649
The features of the same face?

1066
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:30,616
Oh, my soul,

1067
02:42:32,252 --> 02:42:34,328
let me be in you now.

1068
02:42:40,385 --> 02:42:42,674
Look out through my eyes.

1069
02:42:43,972 --> 02:42:46,463
Look out at the things you made.

1070
02:42:51,396 --> 02:42:53,685
All things shining.
