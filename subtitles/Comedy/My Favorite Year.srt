1
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,106
And now the purple dusk

2
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:30,213
of twilight time steals across
the meadows of my heart.

3
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:40,690
High up in the sky, the
little stars climb, always

4
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:44,628
reminding me that we're apart.

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,138
You wander down the lane and far away,

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,742
leaving me a song that will not die.

7
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:10,887
Love is now the stardust of yesterday,

8
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:16,660
the music of the years gone by.

9
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,662
1954.

10
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,898
You don't get years like that anymore.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,499
It was my favorite year.

12
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:03,139
Look.

13
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:04,274
Look at that Buick.

14
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:06,142
See, that's what I'm talking about.

15
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:09,479
In 1954, a Buick was a Buick.

16
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:11,281
It didn't look like a Chevy, which

17
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,823
looks like a Pontiac, which you
can't tell apart from an Olds,

18
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:15,485
like today.

19
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:18,521
This is the way people dressed in 1954.

20
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:19,624
Smooth?

21
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:24,194
Somewhere there's music,
how faint the tune.

23
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:27,898
Somewhere there's heaven,
how high the moon.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,167
In 1954, television was live

25
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,769
and comedy was king.

26
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:36,506
Comic stars like Milton Berle,
Sid Caesar, and Jackie Gleason

27
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:39,309
kept America in front of their TV sets.

28
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,244
I was the freshman writer on "The Comedy."

29
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,713
Cavalcade," starring Stan "King" Kaiser,

30
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,615
Saturday nights at eight.

31
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:46,516
There.

32
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:47,450
There I am.

33
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:48,718
That's me.

34
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,087
Benjy Stone, the guy carrying
the guy with the sword.

35
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:53,490
The guy with the sword is Alan Swann,

36
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:58,161
the greatest movie idol of all
times and my personal hero.

37
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,897
That week, Alan Swann was the guest star

38
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:04,434
on "The Comedy Cavalcade."

39
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:06,069
This is where we wrote the show.

40
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:07,671
30 Rockefeller Plaza.

41
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:08,773
30 Rock, we called it.

42
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,244
Here I was, two years after
being asked to leave Brooklyn.

43
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:16,980
College, and already I was
earning more money per week

44
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:20,016
than the entire fourth floor
of my mother's apartment house

45
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,285
on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn.

46
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:25,789
Anyway, 1954, the week Allen Swann was

47
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:27,991
the guest star on "The Comedy Cavalcade,"

48
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,126
was a major turning point for me.

49
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:31,361
It changed me.

50
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:32,062
How high the moon.

51
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:33,164
Hold it!

52
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:37,734
Good morning.

53
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:39,602
Good morning Good morning.

54
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:41,104
Good morning.
Good morning.

55
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:44,174
Stay friends!

56
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:45,342
Good?

57
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:46,876
You talking to me, Sy?

58
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,345
Look who I'm asking.

59
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:49,479
Sorry I'm late, Sy.

60
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:50,146
The food.

61
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:51,014
The food.

62
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:52,015
Gimme my food!

63
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:54,250
The coffee shop was jammed.

64
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:56,653
Fine, thank you, Sy, and you?

65
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:57,354
Really?

66
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:58,822
No, I didn't think so.

67
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:00,256
What is this, tea?

68
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:01,624
I didn't order tea!

69
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:02,459
That's Herb's.

70
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:03,426
He had the tea and dry toast.

71
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:04,561
This is yours, Sy.

72
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:06,496
Extra-large coffee, six sugars.

73
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,065
Lightly toasted bagel, heavy
butter, just a schmear of cream

74
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,333
cheese, grape jelly, right?

75
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:11,234
Wait a minute.

76
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:13,036
Where's my crumb cake?

77
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:14,004
They were out.

78
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:15,146
Sidney put in a bear claw.

79
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:21,986
Alice, what are we seeing?

80
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:22,879
Clips from Swann's movies.

81
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,447
Clips from his crap.

82
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:25,615
Roll 'em, Herb!

83
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:38,161
This is "Captain
from Tortuga."

84
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:39,796
"Captain from Crap."

85
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:46,236
This is from "Rapture."

86
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:48,805
You call what Swann does acting?

87
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:50,707
That's not acting.

88
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:53,343
It's kissing and jumping
and drinking and humping.

89
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,580
I don't know why we're wasting
our eyesight on this crap.

90
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,093
Swann's never going to show up anyhow.

91
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:01,017
They'll find him, Sy.

92
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,385
What happened?

93
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:04,554
He landed fine last
night, that much we know.

94
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:05,789
So where is he?

95
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,624
Where else?
Drinking and humping.

96
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:44,127
Hello.

97
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,496
Hi.

98
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:00,043
Crap!

99
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:01,145
This is crap!

100
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:03,880
That was the best part!

101
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,415
There is no best part.

102
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:07,161
Swann never made a
decent movie in his life.

103
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:10,253
Sy, that one, "Defender
of the Crown," is a classic.

104
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:11,387
Crap.

105
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,770
And so is "Captain
from Tortuga."

106
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:13,656
Crap.

107
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:14,969
And what about
"Swords of Glory?"

108
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:15,758
- Crap.
- "Amarillo."

109
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,093
- Crap.
- "Sands of the Sudan."

110
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:18,561
Crap.

111
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:20,208
Benjy, you want to see
movies, get a job as an usher.

112
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:24,000
The rest of us are here to write
professional showbiz comedy.

113
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,270
In your case,
semi-professional.

114
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,872
What's the matter, Herb?

115
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:31,941
You can't talk to a person like
a regular, normal human being?

116
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:36,846
No.

117
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:37,780
Come on!

118
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:39,026
King wants us to
see a run-through

119
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,090
of the Boss Hijack sketch.

120
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,586
Hey, Janine!

121
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,022
When you gonna let me get into your box?

122
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:51,294
Hey, kid.

123
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:52,907
Read your bullfighter sketch last night.

124
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:53,663
You liked it?

125
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:54,964
Dozed off halfway through it.

126
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,799
Hey, come on, don't get
the wrong idea, kid.

127
00:06:56,902 --> 00:06:59,536
It's not that it wasn't funny,
it's just that it wasn't funny.

128
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:00,703
Sy, I read that sketch.

129
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,038
I thought it was terrific.

130
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,807
Then maybe you should
be head writer, Alice.

131
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:07,310
I couldn't take the chance.

132
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:08,412
What chance?

133
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:12,148
That I'd become like you.

134
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,450
Hold it!

135
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:22,158
Ho!

136
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
K.C.!

137
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:47,183
Lil, Mr. Silver wants to see
Helen's costume for the Three.

138
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:48,017
Musketeers sketch.

139
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,252
Now he wants it?

140
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:52,689
When I'm up to my ass here in threads?

141
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:56,893
So, let's just have
a quiet dinner tonight.

142
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:57,760
Danny's Hideaway?

143
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:58,394
Yeah.

144
00:07:58,496 --> 00:07:59,696
Lil!

145
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,464
We'll split a Chateaubriand, medium rare?

146
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,766
I got it.

147
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,535
Careful with the tiara, kid.

148
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:09,105
You break it, you bought it.

149
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:12,242
Then a hansom cab ride
through Central Park.

150
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:16,479
From there we hop over to
the Algonquin for a cordial,

151
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,981
and we end the night at your place.

152
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,115
What do you think?

153
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:20,995
Benjamin, why would I
want to go out with you?

154
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:24,320
Every time you come near me,
you embarrass or humiliate me.

155
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,556
I mean, what do you want from me?

156
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Sex.

157
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,329
What is the time?

158
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,230
I don't know.

159
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,031
Don't you have a watch?

160
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:35,865
No.

161
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,367
I'm not allowed to wear a watch.

162
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,269
Why not?

163
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:45,041
Hi.

164
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:46,843
Do you have the time?

165
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:47,945
It's 9:25.

166
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,548
Are you late for something?

167
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:53,651
Always.

168
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,521
And I'm never quite sure for what.

169
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,058
People.

170
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,960
People.

171
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:05,495
I hate to break up the Last Supper,

172
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:09,732
but I wouldn't mind
seeing a run-through.

173
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:13,870
Sorry to tell you this, but
King threw out the monologue.

174
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:16,439
Leo, that monologue was good.

175
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,373
Check that!

176
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,241
Perfect!

177
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:19,375
I wrote it!

178
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,911
Here's where Sy Benson draws the line.

179
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:23,133
Sy, don't do anything crazy.

180
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,447
King's got to be taught.

181
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:26,783
First comes the word,
and the word was funny!

182
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:28,885
The monologue stays, or I go.

183
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,620
Sy, maybe we can compromise.

184
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,789
No compromise.

185
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:34,757
Sy Benson has his integrity, his pride.

186
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:37,694
King does that monologue word
for word or I walk.

187
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:38,528
I walk!

188
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,630
Monologue's in.

189
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,377
- Morning, King.
- Morning, King.

190
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:44,867
- Hello, Stan.
- Hey, good morning.

191
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:45,702
King!

192
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:46,602
About the monologue.

193
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:47,503
But Sy!

194
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:48,504
Do you smell something?

195
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:52,208
It's coming from the script!

196
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,812
It's your monologue!

197
00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:58,348
What a stinkburger.

198
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,349
K.C.!

199
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:01,250
Paul!

200
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:02,385
Boom!

201
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,354
I hate it, it's not funny, it's out.

202
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:08,825
Hey, babe, we're not married to it.

203
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:10,059
Monologue's out.

204
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,861
Sy Benson.

205
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:16,666
A tower of Jell-O.

206
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:24,768
K.C. I think I went a little
too far with Sy just now,

207
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:29,645
really hurt his feelings.

208
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:31,481
I got to get him something.

209
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,583
Here's 100 bucks.

210
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:35,351
Get him something.

211
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:36,819
Tires are nice.

212
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,287
Get him a set of tires.

213
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,201
Call my brother in the
Bronx, he'll tell you where.

214
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:42,759
Boss Hijack sketch, from the top.

215
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,193
K.C.

216
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:45,473
Electrics and cameras, please.

217
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,062
Cameras.

218
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:47,830
Whitewalls.

219
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:50,767
Whitewalls?

220
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:51,901
Here we go.

221
00:10:56,508 --> 00:11:04,046
Five, four, three, two, and copy!

222
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:05,848
Who owns the gray '51 DeSoto?

223
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,083
The new guy, Harris.

224
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,585
You're parked in Boss Hijack's spot.

225
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:10,687
You better move.

226
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,855
The Boss has got some temper on him.

227
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,957
How bad can it be?

228
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,930
We're lucky we're on
the second floor here.

229
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:22,532
It slowed him down.

230
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:37,547
Somebody parked in my spot.

231
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:46,722
Move your car.

232
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,739
That blackout has got
to come a beat sooner.

233
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:52,562
Screams.

234
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:53,696
I guarantee you screams.

235
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:57,066
Well, now all we need
is another 27 minutes

236
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,334
and we got a show this week.

237
00:11:58,436 --> 00:11:59,669
I'm coming in, Sy.

238
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:00,771
Herb!

239
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:07,844
Swann here yet?

240
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:09,312
He's on his way.

241
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:11,225
Alfie went to pick him up,
and then he's, he's...

242
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:12,482
Not here yet, right?

243
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:13,584
Great.

244
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,355
You look real nice today, Alice.

245
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:22,725
Did you like the shoes I sent you?

246
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:23,993
Yeah.

247
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,195
Then why'd you send them back?

248
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:28,631
They were the wrong size.

249
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:29,733
And they were used.

250
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:34,036
Come on, come on, roll this thing.

251
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,772
Benjy, lights!

252
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:43,212
Is this guy gonna be funny?

253
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:45,915
Jumps around nice, but
is he gonna be funny?

254
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,761
Good God, it's Renfield.

255
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,129
I thought he was dead.

256
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,467
So he is.

257
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:05,809
Very good with a sword, though.

258
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,210
Good morrow to you, ladies and gentlemen.

259
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:15,611
He's plastered!

260
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:19,615
So are some of the
finest erections in Europe.

261
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,451
If I were truly plastered,
could I do this?

262
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:25,621
Signor Bumbacelli,
would you hold my sword?

263
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,397
Well, we know he can do that.

264
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:38,868
It's still ticking.

265
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,702
Alfie.

266
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:41,037
Alfie!

267
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,572
What happened?

268
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:45,675
To begin with, there was
some difficulty at the airport.

269
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:48,144
Mr. Swann here had
been reclassified.

270
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:49,612
Reclassified?

271
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:50,980
Yeah.

272
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:51,914
As freight.

273
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,449
Boy.

274
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,429
Then Mr. Swann wanted
to make a couple of stops...

275
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,720
Alfie, I told you to
take him right to the Waldorf!

276
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:00,677
Now I gotta slam your
brakes on, Mr. Silver.

277
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:03,426
When I'm driving Mr. Swann,
he's chief of the car.

278
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,506
And when the chief says he
wants to make some stops,

279
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,997
Alfie Bumbacelli makes the stops.

280
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,632
And that's what I live by.

281
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:13,703
Well, at least we've got
plenty of time to replace him.

282
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:14,537
Dump him!

283
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,972
Leo.

284
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:16,973
Isn't there some way?

285
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:19,442
I mean, the man is a legend.

286
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:20,576
Stan, what do you think?

287
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:25,282
I don't know.

288
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,052
He is a legend.

289
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:31,754
One of the biggest stars ever.

290
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,322
He's one of a kind.

291
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:37,727
A guy like this is irreplaceable.

292
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,762
Replace him, Leo.

293
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:40,864
You can't!

294
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:41,631
Too risky.

295
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:42,531
He's out.

296
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:43,634
King!

297
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,738
You're right.

298
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,006
This is too risky.

299
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:53,376
You can't take a chance
with something like this.

300
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:56,012
Look, King, you're a big star now,

301
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:59,749
and I'm sure you always will be.

302
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:02,918
But suppose... just
suppose, and I know

303
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:05,621
this is never going to happen...

304
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:08,724
But suppose someday
you wind up like this.

305
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,829
I hope nobody does to you
what you're doing to him.

306
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:19,368
Dump him.

307
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,244
Who are you to talk to me
like that, you little Jiminy.

308
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:29,679
Cricket pest bastard?

309
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:33,749
All right, he gets one more chance.

310
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:34,183
- No!
- Yes!

311
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:36,952
Yes!

312
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:40,222
But now you, you're going
to be responsible for him.

313
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,525
Swann better be at every rehearsal sober,

314
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:45,861
or it's your ass, you understand?

315
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:46,862
Now, see, Sy?

316
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:47,697
This kid's got balls.

317
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,799
Oof!

318
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:53,536
A week's salary Swann takes a dive.

319
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:54,336
Hey!

320
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:55,304
Swann dive!
Ba-dum-bum!

321
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:56,406
You're on.

322
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:07,049
Double the lad's bet for me, you toad.

323
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,390
OK, now, pick a card, good, any card.

324
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:16,225
Priscilla.

325
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:17,760
Come here.

326
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:20,429
And now put it back
in the deck, anywhere.

327
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:21,697
How long you workin' here?

328
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,364
Here.

329
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:24,033
About a year.

330
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:25,334
You look real nice today.

331
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:26,502
Thank you.

332
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:28,337
Here, write your address on here.

333
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:29,439
Put it on my desk.

334
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:31,373
I'm gonna send you some steaks.

335
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:32,508
Is that your card?

336
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,143
Yeah, that's my card!

337
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:38,180
Mr. Silver, Boss Rojeck and
his lawyer are in your office.

338
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:39,648
It's about the Boss Hijack sketch.

339
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:46,956
Hey, where are you going?

340
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:47,823
With you.

341
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:48,524
What for?

342
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:50,359
To meet Boss Rojeck.

343
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:51,327
Stan.

344
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:52,928
What's the matter with you?

345
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,465
You think he's here because he
likes the Boss Hijack sketch?

346
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,167
You think he likes being made a fool

347
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:01,871
out of by you in front of 20
million people every week?

348
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:03,072
I don't know.

349
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:04,673
Stan.

350
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:07,943
He's here because he wants us
to drop the Boss Hijack sketch.

351
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:09,845
Think so?

352
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:10,947
Let's go find out.

353
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:12,281
All right, all right.

354
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:13,883
Maybe you better change first.

355
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:14,884
Why?

356
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,886
Well, that outfit might set him off.

357
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:29,098
Mr. Rojeck, sir,
I think you've made

358
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,533
a wise decision to come here.

359
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:32,715
I think these gentlemen
will be able to talk to us...

360
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:35,171
about our problem in a mature way.

361
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:37,306
I'm sure they'll see reason, sir,

362
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:41,210
and there should be
no problem whatsoever.

363
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:42,312
Myron Fein.

364
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,281
I'm Leo Silver.

365
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:46,448
This is King Kaiser.

366
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,083
What do you say, Myron?

367
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:49,218
My client, Karl Rojeck.

368
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:51,254
Karl?

369
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:52,355
It's not Boss?

370
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,390
Stan!

371
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:56,659
Gentlemen.

372
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,241
We'll all be sitting
down, Mr. Rojeck.

373
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:07,903
I'm sure we're all aware
that my client, Mr. Rojeck,

374
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,440
is one of the most respected
labor leaders in America today.

375
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,342
That's why they subpoenaed him.

376
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:14,777
Stan!

377
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,599
Mr. Kaiser, a subpoena
is not an indictment.

378
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:19,982
Now, it has come to our
attention that on two

379
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:21,116
separate occasions...

380
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:25,054
September 4th, 1954, and
September 18th, 1954...

381
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:27,723
A character referred to as
Boss Hijack was portrayed

382
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:29,158
on your television program.

383
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,627
We feel that this
character to a great degree

384
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:33,929
is based upon my client.

385
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:34,897
That's you, Karl.

386
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:36,599
Well, according to our lawyers,

387
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:40,636
your client is a public
figure and as such

388
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:43,205
has already forfeited
certain rights of privacy.

389
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:44,640
Granted.

390
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:46,520
However, even though Mr.
Rojeck concedes that point,

391
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,310
he feels that the
portrayal of said character

392
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:51,747
is slanderous and defamatory
and done with malicious intent,

393
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,016
therefore abrogating the
public figure defense

394
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:55,118
and rendering it...

395
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,023
to wit, actionable.

396
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,524
Did you say that, Karl?

397
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:05,361
What a guy.

398
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:07,763
That's it.

399
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:09,999
I want to clear some things up here.

400
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:13,602
This is a stupid show.

401
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:16,505
And that is a stupid, stupid suit.

402
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,275
And I don't want to see it no more.

403
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:22,244
Hey, take it easy, Karl.

404
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:25,547
I mean, if you really don't
want to see it no more,

405
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,815
then don't watch.

406
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:27,816
Stan!

407
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,785
Let me explain something to you, Karl.

408
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:32,221
We're going to keep on doing the sketch.

409
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:33,555
You know why?

410
00:19:33,658 --> 00:19:34,957
Because it's funny.

411
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:39,094
And in my business, you never cut funny.

412
00:19:39,196 --> 00:19:40,462
Funny?

413
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:43,866
Let me tell you about
the business I'm in.

414
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:46,168
I'm in the removal business.

415
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,905
Now, if I were to feel
that this stupid thing

416
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:55,644
from this stupid show is
bothering me, I'd remove it.

417
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,448
You see, it's gone.

418
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:01,817
And I feel good.

419
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,454
Now, that's how the
removal business works.

420
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:06,722
Do I make myself clear?

421
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:08,302
I think everyone
understands, Mr. Rojeck.

422
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:09,191
Should we leave?

423
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,526
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

424
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:12,394
I'm not clear about a
couple of things here.

425
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:15,397
What you're saying is that
in this removal business,

426
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:23,499
if something bothers you...
Like, like say this...

427
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:25,607
Then you remove it.

428
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,578
- Stan, that is a cashmere coat.
- Like that!

429
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,513
Stan!

430
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,816
You know, you're right.

431
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:35,351
You do feel better.

432
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:37,553
I like the removal business.

433
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,455
I want you.

434
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:40,557
Come on.
Come and get me.

435
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,192
Come on, come on.

436
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:04,813
A fight is rounds.

437
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,015
This is Round One.

438
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:23,432
So the first time I drive him is, what?

439
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,400
Right before the war.

440
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:25,968
1938.

441
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,970
That makes it 16 years.

442
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:28,637
Yeah.

443
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,339
We go way back.

444
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:31,206
You drive anyone else?

445
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:32,341
Sure.

446
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:34,343
But when Mr. Swann's in
town, I drop everything.

447
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,286
Upstairs, boys, all right?

448
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:50,025
La, la, la, la, la, la!

449
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:58,435
Oof!

450
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:04,339
Wonderful to be alive.

451
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:16,985
Make sure you don't fall.

452
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:25,761
What is our estimated time of arrival?

453
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:36,405
Go ahead and lash me, you swine!

454
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:38,674
You'll not loosen my tongue.

455
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:41,510
That's from "Captain From Tortuga"!

456
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:47,015
Excuse me.

457
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:48,838
Had this made special
for when he travels...

458
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:49,952
Calls it his 'drunk suit.'

459
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,240
I have to remind him to
work on some tear-away shoes.

460
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:12,174
Good idea.

461
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:17,312
My god, I'm blind.

462
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:20,582
I cannot see.

463
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:23,152
Help me get him into the tub.

464
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:24,254
I got him.

465
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,434
This is probably more than $35 a night?

466
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:40,636
Tried Try $250.

467
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:43,906
$250 a night?

468
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:46,108
Well, what's that mean
to a guy like Alan Swann?

469
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,377
Nothing... when
you ain't got nothing,

470
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,511
it don't mean nothing.

471
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,046
What are you talking about?

472
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:54,316
You're looking at tap city in there.

473
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:54,950
That's his stockpile.

474
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:56,318
Grab 'em, will you?

475
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:00,589
These must be his drinking socks.

476
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:05,794
Who's this?

477
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:07,329
That's Tess, his daughter.

478
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:09,565
Daughter... I didn't
know he had a daughter.

479
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:10,566
Where is she?

480
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:12,768
She's in Connecticut.

481
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,636
He always has one secret bottle hidden

482
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,438
somewhere for emergencies.

483
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:25,048
We got them all now.

484
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,290
Nah, that guy never actually shot him.

485
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,326
You see, they were
supposed to have this duel,

486
00:24:37,428 --> 00:24:39,394
and I think it was over that Peron dame.

487
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:41,998
Anyhow, they both showed up drunk...
Alfredo!

489
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:45,434
And Swan sort of shot himself.

490
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:58,780
Alfredo, my dear old chum.

491
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:00,722
Tell me, how in the name
of God did I get here?

492
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:02,050
Begin at the airport.

493
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,785
This is Benjy Stone, one of the writers

494
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:04,653
from "Comedy Cavalcade."

495
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:05,988
How do you do?

496
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,801
Alfredo, we should pop
in and see these people.

497
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:08,890
Yes.

498
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:11,093
Plenty of time
tomorrow, Mr. Swann.

499
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:13,562
And since this is your first
time working in television,

500
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:14,975
they've asked me to stay with you

501
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,932
and help you over some
of the rough spots.

502
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:18,267
Like showing up?

503
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:24,273
That's one, another is not passing out.

504
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,141
An honest one.

505
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:28,477
Signor Bumbacelli,
we'll be two for dinner.

506
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,978
Telephone The Stork Club.

507
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,880
You sure you mean
The Stork Club, Mr. Swann?

508
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:33,015
Certainly.

509
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:34,517
It's been a year and a half, surely

510
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:37,386
they've repaired the wall
and the bandstand by now.

511
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:40,088
Would you like to talk about
the sketch before you leave?

512
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,190
On an empty stomach?

513
00:25:41,225 --> 00:25:43,158
No, we'll talk over dinner.

514
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,129
Me, you The Stork Club?

515
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:48,964
Well, after that rather eloquent speech

516
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:50,944
you made earlier this
morning, I didn't think you'd

517
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,501
mind having dinner with me.

518
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:54,936
You heard that?

519
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,071
But you were out.

520
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:59,608
There's out and there's out.

521
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,510
I'd like I'd like to reservation.

522
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:06,715
Well, Stone, what sort
of heroic idiot am I this time?

523
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:07,916
A musketeer idiot.

524
00:26:08,018 --> 00:26:10,085
I read that on the airplane...

525
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:11,653
Very funny, very good.

526
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:12,621
I wrote that.

527
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:15,090
Did you?

528
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:17,559
Bravo, Stone... bravo.

529
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,696
OK, Mr. Swann, table
for two at The Stork Club.

530
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:21,798
Let's move it.

531
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:24,066
Comedy is such a mystery to me.

532
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:25,934
I feel the way Edmund Kean did.

533
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,669
The great English actor?

534
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:33,575
On his deathbed, Kean
was asked how he felt.

535
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:41,016
He answered, dying is
easy, comedy is hard.

536
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:07,175
Thanks, Mr. Charles.

537
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:10,979
Mr. Swann... A pleasure to see you, sir.

539
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:13,215
Pleasure to be seen.

540
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:16,118
Benjamin Stone, my colleague.

541
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,920
Alan, you're looking
absolutely marvelous.

542
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:20,522
- As do you.
- Proper jacket.

543
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:21,356
Much.

544
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,458
We must talk.

545
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:39,374
Thank you.

546
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:40,476
Mr. Swann.

547
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,148
Alan, good to see you.

548
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,482
Call me, will you?

549
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,917
Surely.

550
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:50,152
I'll call you.

551
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:07,002
Welcome back, Mr. Swann.

552
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:07,969
Curt.

553
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:09,304
Can I get you something?

554
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:16,111
Perhaps... Curt, who
is that gorgeous-looking

555
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:17,579
creature over there?

556
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:23,051
No, Mr. Swann,
this is exactly

557
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:25,987
the way it started last time.

558
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,925
In that case, we'll just order dinner...

559
00:28:30,027 --> 00:28:32,894
For now.

560
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:49,711
Victoria was the one
I should have married.

561
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,214
Apart from being the finest
actress I've worked with,

562
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,282
she was the most gracious and intelligent

563
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:57,152
woman I've ever known.

564
00:28:57,254 --> 00:28:59,321
Was it true the two of
you lived together while you

565
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:02,824
were filming "Rapture"?

566
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:07,462
Lord knows, I was married
to almost all her friends.

567
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:11,700
Why did you marry so many of them?

568
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,102
Stone, I didn't marry any of them.

569
00:29:14,204 --> 00:29:15,337
They married me.

570
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,776
Excuse me, Mr. Swann.

571
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,311
I'm Alvin Horn.

572
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,247
My wife, Ann, and I are celebrating

573
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,282
our 40th anniversary.

574
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:28,617
Congratulations, sport.

575
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:31,520
You certainly have more
staying power than I.

576
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:34,956
It would mean so much to her
if you could stop on your way

577
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:37,559
out and just say hello.

578
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:39,127
Why wait?

579
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:40,762
Lead me to the fair Ann.

580
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:50,372
Stone, in a few minutes, I
shall require a diversion.

581
00:29:57,981 --> 00:30:01,016
Mr. Swann, my wife, Ann.

582
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:04,252
Mr. Horn, may I have this
dance with your beautiful wife?

583
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:05,354
Of course.

584
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,662
Wonderful.

585
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:29,037
Come back here!

586
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:47,922
Is it always like this?

587
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:49,724
Somebody stole my girl!

588
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:00,702
"To the question..."

589
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:04,239
'what were you doing
naked, in Central Park,

590
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:06,875
in Bethesda Fountain at
3:00 in the morning?'

591
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:11,179
Swan replied, 'the backstroke.'"
Now is this your idea

592
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:12,714
of watching him, Benjy?

593
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:15,283
The police are treating
it like a parking ticket.

594
00:32:15,385 --> 00:32:16,151
It's no big deal.

595
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:17,253
No big deal?

596
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:18,527
We got kids watching this show.

597
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:20,955
We're talking generations
to come, here...

598
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:23,692
We're discussing morals, here!

599
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:27,829
You're not qualified
to discuss morals, Sy.

600
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:30,298
Up your whole with a mello
roll, Alice, and yours too,

601
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,700
Herb!

602
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:33,722
Leo, it gets me sick to
think we've got to put up

603
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,014
with some washed-up
jabroni who's

604
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,516
going to be running around Central Park

605
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,739
with his schlong hanging out.

606
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,607
My dear fellow, what I choose to do

607
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,910
with my schlong is my business.

608
00:32:42,012 --> 00:32:42,877
How's business?

609
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:44,412
Never better.

610
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:45,346
Stone, good morning.

611
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:46,681
Good morning.

612
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:47,649
'Morning all.

613
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,851
'Morning.

614
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:51,453
'Morning.

615
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,387
Good morning.

616
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:53,489
Good morning.

617
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,957
When King gets here, we'll read

618
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,926
through the musketeer sketch.

619
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:00,328
My assistant, KC Downing... Mr. Swann.

621
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,463
How do you do?

622
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,531
Hello...

623
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:06,234
If there's anything you
need, I can take care of it

624
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:07,068
for you.

625
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,670
Anything?

626
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:10,739
Within reason, I...

627
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,474
Well, let's begin with some tea

628
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,809
and see where that leads us.

629
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:18,046
Tea.

630
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:19,180
Do you drink bags?

631
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:21,216
I mean, do you... I mean, are these OK...

633
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:22,050
Tea bags?

634
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:23,152
Surely, surely.

635
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:26,622
Now... Good morning, Mr. Kaiser.

637
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:36,765
What do you say?

638
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:38,767
Leo.

639
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:43,071
And... good
morning, Mr. Swann.

640
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:48,843
Hey, where's the musketeers set?

641
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,312
OK, it isn't here.

642
00:33:51,414 --> 00:33:52,547
That's where it is.

643
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:53,915
And they won't deliver it.

644
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:55,083
Rojeck did it.

645
00:33:55,185 --> 00:33:56,618
Now you happy?

646
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,252
Rojeck?

647
00:33:57,354 --> 00:33:58,219
Yeah.

648
00:33:58,321 --> 00:33:59,988
I've got a great idea.

649
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,491
Let's just wrap, drop the
Boss Hijack sketch this week.

650
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:04,771
Get me that set, you understand?

651
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:06,305
I want that set.
All right, I'll do it.

652
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:07,507
I don't care if you have to
rent trucks, find drivers...

653
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:08,296
Stop hitting me with that...

654
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:09,030
Get that set here!

655
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:09,998
Build a set!

656
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,266
Steal a set, I don't care!

657
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:13,008
Nobody's going to tell
King Kaiser that...

658
00:34:16,873 --> 00:34:19,774
OK, I'm going to go back
there and get my script.

659
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:22,255
And then I'll come back here and
we'll read through the sketch.

660
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:24,779
And then we'll work out
the set problem, OK, Leo?

661
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:31,786
OK, everybody, let's take 10 minutes.

662
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:32,888
"Cavalcade."

663
00:34:35,592 --> 00:34:36,791
Benjy Stone!

664
00:34:36,893 --> 00:34:39,260
Telephone!

665
00:34:40,864 --> 00:34:41,763
Hello?

666
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:43,131
Benjamin, darling.

667
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:44,365
Ma.

668
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:45,878
Did you watch the show Saturday night?

669
00:34:45,902 --> 00:34:47,335
No, we watched wrestling instead...

670
00:34:47,437 --> 00:34:49,237
Of course I saw the show.

671
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,438
Well?

672
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,406
Well, what else?

673
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,474
It was brilliant, darling.

674
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:57,345
Just one thing... Who
is this Benjy Stone?

676
00:34:57,447 --> 00:34:59,113
Ma, don't start in.

677
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:01,150
Do you think... Sh!

679
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,064
You think I'll ever see the name Benjamin

680
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,756
Steinberg... a real name... go
by King Kaiser's face one day?

681
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,226
Look who's talking,
Mrs. Belle "Cari-oca."

682
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:13,728
Carroca... Carroca.

683
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,964
Carroca, Carroca.

684
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:17,198
Rookie, shush.

685
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,801
See, now you upset your stepfather.

686
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:22,170
Ma, could you just call
him 'Rookie, ' and not

687
00:35:22,272 --> 00:35:23,571
my stepfather all the time?

688
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:28,676
Benjamin, darling...
Rookie, dust.

689
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:33,047
Before your beloved father
passed away and eventually

690
00:35:33,149 --> 00:35:38,219
died, he said to me, Belle,
after I go, get someone

691
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:42,056
to be with, someone nice... A pal.

693
00:35:42,158 --> 00:35:44,726
So you went out and found
a Filipino bantamweight

694
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:46,394
named Rookie Carroca?

695
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:50,765
Rookie Carroca who held the
title for well over six months.

696
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:53,568
Until Manny Serpa turned
him into a guava jelly

697
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,469
at the Garden.

698
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:55,737
Serpa butted him.

699
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,473
I'll fight Serpa today
and take him apart.

700
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,275
Do you hear what you started here?

701
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:02,278
Ma... What?

703
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:03,945
Was there a reason you called?

704
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,381
Only to remind you that you're coming

705
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:07,723
here for dinner tomorrow night.

706
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:10,785
No... Ma, I can't make it.

707
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,855
Alan Swann's on the show
and they made me his keeper.

708
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:15,623
Alan Swann from the movies?

709
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:16,791
Yeah.

710
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:19,594
Rookie, Alan Swann from the movies.

711
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,930
So bring him along.

712
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:23,898
Bring Alan Swann to Brooklyn?

713
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,300
Well, why not?

714
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:26,634
What are you ashamed of?

715
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:28,069
Everything.

716
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:30,038
And Benjamin, when you get here,

717
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,572
be nice to my Rookie.

718
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:32,473
He likes you.

719
00:36:32,575 --> 00:36:34,542
Yeah, and I like him.

720
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:36,611
I tell you what, I'll
bring him a present.

721
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:39,514
Does he need a new machete?

722
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:44,552
Eyes... it's
always in the eyes.

723
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:47,555
You... I would like
a word with you.

724
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:49,958
Benjamin, we're in the middle of an

725
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,426
interesting conversation here.

726
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:53,628
I bet it's real interesting.

727
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,898
What's the subject of this
interesting conversation?

728
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,500
These eyes.

729
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:02,036
They're Merle Oberon's eyes.

730
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,338
Merle Oberon's?

731
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,684
And what's Merle doing for eyes...

732
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,108
Using Katharine Hepburn's?

733
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,145
Excuse me, Alan.

734
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:13,548
Excuse me, Alan.

735
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,017
Benjamin, what is the matter with you?

736
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,785
Me?

737
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,298
If you're going to fall for every movie

738
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,522
star who comes on the
show, what kind of a future

739
00:37:21,624 --> 00:37:22,490
are we going to have?

740
00:37:22,592 --> 00:37:26,361
The same as we have now... None.

742
00:37:26,463 --> 00:37:30,965
Wait... give her a head start.

743
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:33,134
It gives her the illusion
she's being chased.

744
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:44,879
These cans say, 'crushed.'

745
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:47,415
Where the hell are the pineapple girls?

746
00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:48,683
Hey, I'm sorry.

747
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:49,884
I acted like a jerk.

748
00:37:49,986 --> 00:37:51,352
You're being too easy on yourself.

749
00:37:51,454 --> 00:37:54,455
And where did you get the
idea that we have a future?

750
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:56,324
We have an understanding.

751
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:57,592
What understanding?

752
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,560
That I am hopelessly in love with you

753
00:37:59,662 --> 00:38:01,102
and you couldn't care less about me.

754
00:38:01,164 --> 00:38:02,730
Yeah... yeah, you
could say that.

755
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:06,167
Well, maybe this will change your mind.

756
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:10,138
This belonged to my grandmother
and I want you to have it.

757
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:16,711
Benjamin, I can't take that.

758
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:19,580
Fine... how about a car?

759
00:38:19,682 --> 00:38:20,748
Benjamin, the ring.

760
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,050
It was glass.

761
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:25,486
Sanctuary, sanctuary!

762
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:27,789
Sanctuary, my ass.

763
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,226
I'm sorry, ladies, there was a...

764
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,836
Benjamin, would you get out of here?

765
00:38:34,931 --> 00:38:36,571
No, not until you
tell me exactly what was

766
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:37,932
going on between you and Swann.

767
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:39,333
Look, just get out of here.

768
00:38:39,436 --> 00:38:40,568
Hey, I'm in here.

769
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,336
Wait... I was saving
this for later.

770
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:43,204
What are you doing?

771
00:38:43,306 --> 00:38:43,938
What's he doing?

772
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,106
- I'm proposing.
- What?

773
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,441
What?

774
00:38:46,543 --> 00:38:48,776
I'm proposing that we live
together, and if we like it,

775
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:49,610
we get married.

776
00:38:49,712 --> 00:38:50,578
Come on, say yes.

777
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,779
God.

778
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:53,247
My god.

779
00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:54,727
All right, if that's too
tough, just nod your head.

780
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:55,917
You get the hell out of here.

781
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:57,819
Please, give me a word, a sign, a sound.

782
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,250
That's not the sound I was looking for.

783
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:05,660
All right, the hell
with it, I'm coming out now.

784
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,361
Stone... time for lunch.

785
00:39:07,464 --> 00:39:08,196
What?

786
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:10,665
I... Just going to the lavatory.

788
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,201
This is for ladies only.

789
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:15,970
And so is this, ma'am.

790
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:17,149
But every now and again, I have to

791
00:39:17,173 --> 00:39:18,373
run a little water through it.

792
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,778
No, Stone, I insist...
Lunch is on me.

793
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,580
I... I got it.

794
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:27,248
Thoughtful.

795
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,418
Stone, I want you to know
that, this morning, I

796
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,087
had absolutely no idea that I
was in the process of inserting

797
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:35,067
myself into an arrangement
which already existed

798
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:36,235
between you and Miss Downing.

799
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:37,470
Would it have made any difference?

800
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:38,759
No.

801
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:40,128
Are you in love with the girl?

802
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,029
I think I am.

803
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:43,297
I don't know what she wants.

804
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:45,032
Romance, Stone...
That's the only thing

805
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,567
we can be sure they all want.

806
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:48,069
I've never met anyone like her.

807
00:39:48,171 --> 00:39:50,471
She never met anyone like you.

808
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:52,573
Use that... cultivate it.

809
00:39:52,675 --> 00:39:54,842
Right there is where I lost you.

810
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:57,445
Stone, women love the intrigue.

811
00:39:57,547 --> 00:39:59,914
They enjoy unraveling
the mystery that is man,

812
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:01,927
but you must allow them the
freedom to discover you.

813
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:02,951
Is that what you do?

814
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:06,420
No, I don't have that luxury.

815
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:09,290
The women who are interested
in me know exactly who I am

816
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:10,392
and what they want.

817
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:12,326
And nine times out of 10, they get it.

818
00:40:12,428 --> 00:40:13,828
That's some curse.

819
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,897
You'd be surprised.

820
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,639
You see, no matter what I do, I can never

821
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:19,500
fulfill their expectations.

822
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:22,437
Could I... Could I have...

824
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:58,306
So, this is the Benjy
Stone version of dinner

825
00:40:58,408 --> 00:40:59,607
and a movie?

826
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,420
Doesn't Sy's office take
on a whole different feeling

827
00:41:01,444 --> 00:41:02,043
at night?

828
00:41:02,145 --> 00:41:03,744
Yeah, it gets worse.

829
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:06,314
OK, here we go.

830
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:08,749
These are all dim sum...
Chinese dumplings.

832
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:10,184
These are pan-fried.

833
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:12,820
Those are steamed... they're
good just with vinegar.

834
00:41:12,922 --> 00:41:15,756
Chili sauce... stay
away from this, baby.

835
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,236
A couple of drops of this and your tongue

836
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,160
dials the fire department.

837
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:20,528
You know how to use these?

838
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,463
To make a sweater, yes.

839
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:23,565
OK, I'll show you.

840
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:25,066
Look... balance is
everything... one

841
00:41:25,168 --> 00:41:27,535
goes there, the other
one on top like that.

842
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:31,639
Now do exactly as I do.

843
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:34,762
Dim sum are too hard
to eat with chopsticks.

844
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:36,210
Don't make yourself crazy.

845
00:41:36,312 --> 00:41:37,312
OK.

846
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:40,748
You really know this stuff.

847
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,317
Katherine, Jews know two things...

848
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:47,521
Suffering and where to
find great Chinese food.

849
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:56,364
What?

850
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:59,900
Too loud... what, what?

851
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:02,403
No, no, it's just... It's really nice.

853
00:42:02,505 --> 00:42:05,439
You know, you're just sitting
there having your dinner,

854
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:09,777
wearing men's clothing...
Well, sort of.

855
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:11,319
I mean, that I really like this guy.

856
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:13,514
I like this guy much
better than the other guy.

857
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:14,982
What other guy?

858
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:17,251
You know, the guy in the tiara.

859
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:19,220
The mosquito who bothers
you in elevators.

860
00:42:19,322 --> 00:42:20,966
The person who runs down
the hallway with scotch

861
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,659
tape all over his
body... the human fly.

862
00:42:24,761 --> 00:42:26,527
Ew!

863
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,463
Do you think... Do not think...

865
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:32,867
No, I was just going to say,
do you think there are funny

866
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,503
people and not-funny people?

867
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:37,571
Yes, definitely.

868
00:42:37,674 --> 00:42:40,841
On the funny side, there are the
Marx Brothers... except Zeppo,

869
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:42,576
the Ritz brothers...
No exceptions,

870
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:45,846
both Laurel and Hardy,
and Woody Woodpecker.

871
00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:48,582
On the unfunny side, there is
anybody who has ever played

872
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:51,652
the accordion professionally.

873
00:42:51,754 --> 00:42:53,187
And me.

874
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:56,090
You know, everybody who works
here is funny, except me.

875
00:42:56,192 --> 00:42:57,758
No, you're funny.

876
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,160
Really?

877
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:01,829
When?

878
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:04,432
Well, I'm sure you could be funny.

879
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:05,900
How?

880
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:07,002
You can tell a joke.

881
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:07,902
Anyone can tell a joke.

882
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:09,737
Not me.

883
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,439
Yes, you can.

884
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,673
I'll teach you.

885
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:17,411
I'll tell you a joke and
you tell it back to me, OK?

886
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:19,613
OK, I'll try.

887
00:43:19,716 --> 00:43:23,417
First rule... never
tell a joke sitting down.

888
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,588
You have to be on your
feet and use your hands.

889
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,591
This guy walks into a
psychiatrist's office.

890
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:31,759
He has a duck on his head.

891
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:33,594
The psychiatrist says, can I help you?

892
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:35,730
The duck says, yeah,
get this guy off my ass.

893
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:38,699
OK, now you try.

894
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:41,769
OK, here goes.

895
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:43,971
A man... Hold it.

897
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:45,593
'This guy'... it's
better than 'a man.'

898
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:46,374
OK.

899
00:43:46,476 --> 00:43:47,476
Sorry.

900
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:48,876
And use your hands.

901
00:43:48,978 --> 00:43:49,710
Right.

902
00:43:49,812 --> 00:43:51,979
Sorry, go ahead.

903
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:55,883
This guy walks into a doctor's office...

904
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:57,017
Psychiatrist.

905
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,452
Psychiatrist...
Right, OK, sorry.

906
00:43:58,554 --> 00:43:59,286
OK, I got it.

907
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,222
I got it.

908
00:44:01,324 --> 00:44:03,624
This guy walks into a psychiatrist's

909
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,727
office wearing a duck... What?

911
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:06,594
Wearing a duck?
Wearing a duck?

912
00:44:06,696 --> 00:44:07,696
No.

913
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:09,463
He has a duck on his head.

914
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:10,976
I told you I wasn't very good at this.

915
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,834
No, it's my fault. It's... It's good.

917
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:14,936
Yeah?

918
00:44:14,971 --> 00:44:16,203
OK.

919
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,939
This guy walks into a
psychiatrist's office

920
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,207
with a duck on his head.

921
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:23,177
And the guy says to the psychiatrist,

922
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:25,646
will you help me, because
I have a duck on my head?

923
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,823
What is that for?

924
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:37,291
Accordion lessons.

925
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:45,933
Well, that ends the dinner
portion of the evening.

926
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:47,735
Now it's time for the movie portion.

927
00:45:08,758 --> 00:45:09,657
Lord Drummond.

928
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,059
Lord Drummond!

929
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:13,594
Drummond.

930
00:45:13,696 --> 00:45:16,397
If it would put you at ease,
I could turn my back again.

931
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:17,499
Sh!

932
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:19,366
You will this day, taste my steel.

933
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,535
Then leave us not dally, Drummond,

934
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:24,939
for today, I have an engagement
to mount the throne of England.

935
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,507
Over my dead body.

936
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:27,208
Quiet.

937
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,776
As you wish.

938
00:45:28,878 --> 00:45:29,922
Are going to keep doing this?

939
00:45:29,946 --> 00:45:31,745
As you wish.

940
00:45:31,848 --> 00:45:32,580
Sir John!

941
00:45:32,682 --> 00:45:33,581
Benjamin!

942
00:45:33,683 --> 00:45:34,683
Sh!

943
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:13,247
I guess this is the kissing

944
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:14,848
portion of the evening.

945
00:47:29,532 --> 00:47:30,397
I am Arrogant!

946
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:31,231
He's Arrogant!

947
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:32,334
He's Arrogant!

948
00:47:32,368 --> 00:47:33,801
And I am Porthole!

949
00:47:33,903 --> 00:47:34,802
He's Porthole!

950
00:47:34,904 --> 00:47:35,769
He's Porthole!

951
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:36,770
And I am Swann!

952
00:47:36,872 --> 00:47:37,605
He's Swann!

953
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:38,606
He's Swann!

954
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:40,608
It's one for all and all for one.

955
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,810
And me for you and tea for two!

956
00:47:43,913 --> 00:47:44,812
Break it up!

957
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:46,213
Break it up!

958
00:47:46,315 --> 00:47:47,948
Everybody, OK, all right.

959
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,183
Now hold it!
Hold it!

960
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:50,285
Hold it, hold it!

961
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,553
Wait, I want to say something.

962
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:58,392
Alan... I want
to tell you that I

963
00:47:58,494 --> 00:47:59,893
was a little worried about you.

964
00:47:59,996 --> 00:48:01,028
Only a little?

965
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,341
I would have thought my reputation

966
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:04,832
warranted major concern.

967
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:06,233
Yeah, you're right.

968
00:48:06,335 --> 00:48:08,636
I was going to dump you.

969
00:48:08,738 --> 00:48:16,738
But I'm glad I didn't,
because well, I've seen all

970
00:48:21,183 --> 00:48:27,221
of your films and I'm a fan.

971
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:29,223
And here we are, working together,

972
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:36,797
and it's been nice, because you're funny.

973
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:38,499
You're really funny.

974
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:41,068
Praise indeed, sir.

975
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,736
And may I say that other than one

976
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:45,272
remarkable season with an
English repertory company,

977
00:48:45,374 --> 00:48:47,975
this is the most fun and
the hardest work I've

978
00:48:48,077 --> 00:48:49,410
done since the world was young.

979
00:48:54,383 --> 00:48:57,217
That's great, really.

980
00:48:57,319 --> 00:48:59,820
But one other thing...

981
00:48:59,922 --> 00:49:03,924
You're going to show up
tomorrow, too, right?

982
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:04,792
Right, Swann?

983
00:49:04,894 --> 00:49:05,926
Right, Porthole.

984
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:08,495
But our needs must take
leave of you, for Stone

985
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:14,001
and I journey to dine in some
far-off land called Brooklyn.

986
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:15,502
Well, that's it.

987
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:17,771
Big day, tomorrow... show day.

988
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:18,772
Have a good night.

989
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:19,740
See you at 10:00 AM.

990
00:49:19,842 --> 00:49:20,374
'Night.

991
00:49:20,476 --> 00:49:21,942
Goodnight.

992
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:22,810
Good night, then.

993
00:49:22,912 --> 00:49:23,577
Take it easy.

994
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:24,812
Thank you, everybody.

995
00:49:24,914 --> 00:49:26,580
Nice work today.

996
00:49:26,682 --> 00:49:29,016
Do it that good on the show tomorrow.

997
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:31,185
You all right?

998
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:32,287
It's all right, I'm OK.

999
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:33,465
It's no problem, it's nothing.

1000
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:34,700
The thing fell, it's nothing, really.

1001
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:35,756
Go home.
Go home, really.

1002
00:49:35,858 --> 00:49:37,391
- You're sure you're OK?
- I'm OK.

1003
00:49:37,493 --> 00:49:38,392
I want you to get some rest.
Now everybody go home.

1004
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:39,393
I'm all right.

1005
00:49:39,495 --> 00:49:40,572
I promise you I'm all right.

1006
00:49:40,596 --> 00:49:42,696
Come on, let's go home.

1007
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:44,998
Come on.

1008
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:47,267
My god.

1009
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:49,770
It was an accident, Leo.

1010
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:51,171
Rojeck.

1011
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:55,843
That's it, I'm not going to let
you do the Boss Hijack sketch.

1012
00:49:55,945 --> 00:49:57,678
It's an accident, Leo, an accident.

1013
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,747
And we're doing the Boss Hijack sketch.

1014
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:01,348
Stan!

1015
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,017
Leo!

1016
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
Thanks for caring.

1017
00:50:10,493 --> 00:50:12,726
By the by, Stone, where is this Brooklyn?

1018
00:50:12,828 --> 00:50:14,261
Another world.

1019
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:36,250
Hop in.

1020
00:50:36,352 --> 00:50:37,818
Mort, come on, honey.

1021
00:50:54,737 --> 00:50:57,905
Uncle Morty, how odd to find you here.

1022
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:59,039
Why?

1023
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:01,708
I just caught the 7:45
elevator down from six.

1024
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:03,977
I assume Aunt Sadie is here also?

1025
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,413
Not yet, but she'll be.

1026
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:10,350
Uncle Morty, say hello to Alan Swann.

1027
00:51:10,452 --> 00:51:13,921
I didn't catch the name.

1028
00:51:22,298 --> 00:51:24,832
Alan Swann, Rookie "Cari-oca."

1029
00:51:24,934 --> 00:51:26,033
Carroca.

1030
00:51:26,135 --> 00:51:29,303
There was a lethal
bantamweight called Carroca.

1031
00:51:29,405 --> 00:51:31,405
You're looking at him.

1032
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:35,008
I saw you fight in San Diego.

1033
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:35,909
Sailor Donovan?

1034
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:36,610
Right.

1035
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:37,778
Took him out in three.

1036
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,880
Two.

1037
00:51:38,981 --> 00:51:40,747
Who knew the
China-man was a fighter?

1038
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,516
To me, he doesn't open a mouth.

1039
00:51:42,618 --> 00:51:44,484
Still in the fight game?

1040
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:45,752
In a way.

1041
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,688
I married Benjy's mother.

1042
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:54,494
Benjamin, darling, how
wonderful to have you to home.

1043
00:51:54,597 --> 00:51:56,663
I gotta get back to my meatloaf.

1044
00:51:56,765 --> 00:51:59,933
Mr. Swann, may I
present my mother,

1045
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:02,903
Mrs. Belle Mae Steinberg
Carroca of Brooklyn,

1046
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:04,771
New York and Miami Beach, Florida for two

1047
00:52:04,874 --> 00:52:06,373
weeks each and every winter.

1048
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:10,010
Benjamin, why didn't you tell
me your mother was so lovely?

1049
00:52:10,112 --> 00:52:10,911
For me?

1050
00:52:11,013 --> 00:52:13,447
No, for me.

1051
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:15,515
Mr. Swann... Alan, please.

1053
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:17,217
And what may I call you?

1054
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:19,920
How about 'yours'?

1055
00:52:20,022 --> 00:52:25,058
Alan, on behalf of everyone
here, I would like to welcome

1056
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,629
you to our humble chapeau.

1057
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:31,899
Two years at the Sorbonne,
she still gets it wrong.

1058
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:33,133
- Al...
- Ma!

1059
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:34,034
What?

1060
00:52:34,136 --> 00:52:35,702
It's not 'Al.'

1061
00:52:35,804 --> 00:52:39,006
if I bring Capone or
Jolson, then it's Al.

1062
00:52:39,108 --> 00:52:40,641
Jolson's coming?

1063
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:43,744
Alan, I want you to feel perfectly

1064
00:52:43,846 --> 00:52:45,746
free to do whatever you would normally

1065
00:52:45,848 --> 00:52:48,916
do in your own apartment.

1066
00:52:49,018 --> 00:52:50,651
Something to drink before dinner?

1067
00:52:50,753 --> 00:52:53,053
Some soda water?

1068
00:52:53,155 --> 00:52:54,155
Rookie!

1069
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:55,756
A glass of seltzer!

1070
00:52:55,858 --> 00:52:57,291
Pick it up!

1071
00:52:57,393 --> 00:52:58,659
Excuse me.

1072
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:02,597
Sorry.

1073
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:08,802
Excuse me, Mr. Swann.

1074
00:53:08,904 --> 00:53:11,438
I hate to impose, but I wonder
if you would mind signing...

1075
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,041
An autograph... certainly.

1076
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:29,056
If you don't mind, make it
to Sadie and Morty Kronsky...

1077
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:30,457
That's with a 'k.'

1078
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,961
The rest is the way it's usually spelled.

1079
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:37,097
That's probably Aunt Sadie.

1080
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,467
Why don't you go open
the door for your wife?

1081
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:43,003
Thank you, Mr. Swann.

1082
00:53:46,108 --> 00:53:47,641
Al... Thank you.

1084
00:53:47,743 --> 00:53:48,608
Your seltzer.

1085
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:50,243
A little liver?

1086
00:53:50,346 --> 00:53:52,079
No, thank you.

1087
00:53:55,551 --> 00:54:00,153
Sadie, you look beautiful.

1088
00:54:00,255 --> 00:54:01,355
What a lovely dress.

1089
00:54:01,457 --> 00:54:03,190
You like it?

1090
00:54:03,292 --> 00:54:04,391
I only wore it once.

1091
00:54:04,493 --> 00:54:06,226
Come and get it!

1092
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:07,961
Dinner is served.

1093
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:16,303
Rookie, your Meatloaf
Mindanao was superb.

1094
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:17,604
Thanks.

1095
00:54:17,706 --> 00:54:19,940
That takes two days to prepare, you know.

1096
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:21,074
Really?

1097
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:23,710
Tell me, what was that
rather pungent taste?

1098
00:54:23,812 --> 00:54:24,812
Parrot.

1099
00:54:26,882 --> 00:54:29,416
And they're not easy to work with.

1100
00:54:29,518 --> 00:54:31,618
They put up some squawk.

1101
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,588
I can imagine.

1102
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,491
What was that dish?

1103
00:54:37,593 --> 00:54:39,192
Filipino pork and beans.

1104
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:40,727
Where was the pork?

1105
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:41,728
You can't!

1106
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,663
There's Jews here.

1107
00:54:43,766 --> 00:54:46,400
So I guess if you want to be technical...

1108
00:54:46,502 --> 00:54:48,835
What's the difference?

1109
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:52,706
So, Mr. Swann, now
that we sat nice,

1110
00:54:52,808 --> 00:54:56,676
broke bread together,
shared a glass of wine,

1111
00:54:56,779 --> 00:54:58,712
I feel I know you a little.

1112
00:54:58,814 --> 00:55:01,515
Morty, I feel I know you even better.

1113
00:55:01,617 --> 00:55:04,017
Good.

1114
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:06,486
Then you won't mind if
I ask you a question?

1115
00:55:06,588 --> 00:55:08,822
Uncle Morty... What are you worried?

1117
00:55:08,924 --> 00:55:09,924
It's not personal.

1118
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:12,459
What was I, born in Minsk or Pinsk?

1119
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:13,627
I know my way around.

1120
00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:15,829
Morty, ask your question.

1121
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:18,398
That paternity wrap, a couple years ago.

1122
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,232
Morty!

1123
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:20,100
Did you shtup her?

1124
00:55:20,202 --> 00:55:21,635
Morty, shut up!

1125
00:55:21,737 --> 00:55:23,303
Did you go all the way?

1126
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:24,538
- What?
- Morty!

1127
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,206
- Uncle Morty, you are...
- What?

1128
00:55:26,308 --> 00:55:26,907
My god.

1129
00:55:27,009 --> 00:55:28,041
It's all right.

1130
00:55:28,143 --> 00:55:28,809
It's all right.

1131
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:30,777
All right... It's all right.

1132
00:55:30,879 --> 00:55:34,614
Morty, I hope this doesn't
lessen your opinion of me,

1133
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:37,584
but the answer is no.

1134
00:55:37,686 --> 00:55:42,923
You see, people like me, we're targets.

1135
00:55:43,025 --> 00:55:44,558
I'm blamed for a lot of things I had

1136
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,093
absolutely nothing to do with.

1137
00:55:46,195 --> 00:55:49,729
On the other hand, because of who I am,

1138
00:55:49,832 --> 00:55:51,698
I get away with murder in other areas.

1139
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,734
I suppose it all balances out in the end.

1140
00:55:54,837 --> 00:55:56,103
Does it really, Swanee?

1141
00:55:56,205 --> 00:56:00,607
Ma, he's an actor, not a river.

1142
00:56:00,709 --> 00:56:05,912
Swanee, can I talk frank to you?

1143
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:07,014
Certainly, Belle.

1144
00:56:11,086 --> 00:56:13,553
Take a good look here.

1145
00:56:13,655 --> 00:56:18,024
This this... this is good.

1146
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:20,961
Sitting around with people you love.

1147
00:56:21,063 --> 00:56:24,264
Some you just like, others,
maybe you could live without,

1148
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:25,366
excuse me.

1149
00:56:27,069 --> 00:56:31,738
Sharing stories, sharing warm...

1150
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,007
This is real life, Alan.

1151
00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:36,076
And this is what you need...

1152
00:56:36,178 --> 00:56:43,550
A home and a family and children?

1153
00:56:43,652 --> 00:56:46,253
Hey, who knows?

1154
00:56:46,355 --> 00:56:48,622
Unfortunately, Belle,
that part of my life

1155
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:50,557
hasn't worked out too well.

1156
00:56:50,659 --> 00:56:54,861
Though I did produce a
perfectly glorious little child.

1157
00:56:54,963 --> 00:56:56,997
Her name is Tess.

1158
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:02,669
See, you're a daddy,
and this I didn't even know.

1159
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:03,970
So where is she?

1160
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:07,107
She lives with her mother in Connecticut.

1161
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:09,042
I haven't seen her in over a year.

1162
00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:12,279
A year?

1163
00:57:12,381 --> 00:57:14,414
Shame on you, Swanee.

1164
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:15,949
Yes, you're right, Belle.

1165
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:21,054
Shame on me, indeed.

1166
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:28,895
Well, time to go.

1167
00:57:28,997 --> 00:57:30,564
What a divine evening.

1168
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,732
We must do this again, real soon...

1169
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,234
Say, at the turn of the century?

1170
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:39,673
Rookie, Sadie, Morty.

1171
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:41,274
Goodbye, Mr. Swann.

1172
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:43,443
Belle.

1173
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,812
Alan.

1174
00:57:45,914 --> 00:57:47,414
Oy vey.

1175
00:57:55,224 --> 00:57:57,757
Mr. and Mrs.
Kessler... apartment 4B.

1176
00:57:57,859 --> 00:57:59,192
God bless you, Mr. Swann.

1177
00:57:59,294 --> 00:58:01,361
Mr. and Mrs. Berkowitz,
apartment 2A... we love you.

1178
00:58:01,463 --> 00:58:04,431
Nathan and Lily Cantor,
second floor front... pleasure

1179
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:05,699
to have you in the building.

1180
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:08,101
Scalfoni, 1I...
You're the best.

1181
00:58:08,203 --> 00:58:09,703
How did you get into the building?

1182
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:11,471
I'm the super.

1183
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:12,305
Goodbye!

1184
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:15,308
Goodbye!

1185
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:48,942
Doctor Bumbacelli...
My medication.

1186
00:58:49,044 --> 00:58:50,277
Your medication.

1187
00:58:56,551 --> 00:59:02,989
Mr. Swann... Big day tomorrow, show day.

1189
00:59:03,091 --> 00:59:05,392
And you know, I'm supposed to watch.

1190
00:59:05,494 --> 00:59:06,526
Good, watch this.

1191
00:59:09,064 --> 00:59:10,064
Want to see it again?

1192
00:59:14,503 --> 00:59:18,171
Stone, you can either
watch me or join me.

1193
00:59:18,273 --> 00:59:19,739
One of them's more fun.

1194
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:21,541
You were a hit in Brooklyn.

1195
00:59:21,643 --> 00:59:22,720
Want to try the Bronx next?

1196
00:59:22,744 --> 00:59:23,744
No.

1197
00:59:23,779 --> 00:59:26,346
1030 Park Avenue... the Downings.

1198
00:59:26,448 --> 00:59:27,714
No.

1199
00:59:27,816 --> 00:59:28,816
Please, no.

1200
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:29,716
Let's not go there.

1201
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:31,117
Why are we going there?

1202
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:33,219
Why, to reweave the
fabric of your relationship

1203
00:59:33,322 --> 00:59:34,921
with the fair KC, that's why.

1204
00:59:35,023 --> 00:59:36,489
This surprise visit should do it.

1205
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:39,359
I... I don't
think so, Mr. Swann.

1206
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:41,594
KC Downing's parents
are having a big party.

1207
00:59:41,697 --> 00:59:43,963
Besides, they're not going to
let us up in that building.

1208
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:45,732
Excellent.

1209
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:47,033
Ever done any mountaineering?

1210
00:59:55,110 --> 01:00:01,781
Now all we have to do is
to get from here to there.

1211
01:00:01,883 --> 01:00:03,717
It won't work.

1212
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:07,520
It worked perfectly well in
"A Slight Case of Divorce."

1213
01:00:07,622 --> 01:00:09,189
That was a movie.

1214
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:11,291
This is real life.

1215
01:00:14,796 --> 01:00:18,264
What is the difference?

1216
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:22,402
No.

1217
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:28,007
It's stuck.

1218
01:00:31,146 --> 01:00:35,048
What we need is something like a rope.

1219
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:43,623
Let's not do this.

1220
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:46,459
Stone... I've done it 100 times!

1222
01:00:51,867 --> 01:00:53,767
Always had a stuntman.

1223
01:01:07,015 --> 01:01:08,015
Perfect.

1224
01:01:11,453 --> 01:01:12,886
Wait!

1225
01:01:12,988 --> 01:01:14,020
Wait, wait, wait!

1226
01:01:14,122 --> 01:01:14,988
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1227
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:16,189
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1228
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:18,725
Let's just go back to the way we came

1229
01:01:18,827 --> 01:01:20,860
and go through her front door.

1230
01:01:20,962 --> 01:01:22,295
Dull!

1231
01:01:22,397 --> 01:01:23,029
Boring!

1232
01:01:23,131 --> 01:01:25,231
Old hat.

1233
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:27,200
Stone, the cardinal rule...

1234
01:01:27,302 --> 01:01:30,136
They always a big entrance!

1235
01:01:30,238 --> 01:01:31,671
I assure you this.

1236
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,380
Does anybody die in these movies?

1237
01:01:40,482 --> 01:01:43,183
Die?

1238
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:46,920
Of course not... it's just fun!

1239
01:01:47,022 --> 01:01:48,421
Fun?

1240
01:01:48,523 --> 01:01:50,156
Fun!

1241
01:01:50,258 --> 01:01:53,993
He thinks this is fun!

1242
01:01:56,398 --> 01:01:59,365
I'm going down. Now.

1243
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:03,102
When I arrive, I shall
hold the rope taut,

1244
01:02:03,205 --> 01:02:04,537
and you can just shimmy down.

1245
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:07,941
I'm not shimmying down anything.

1246
01:02:08,043 --> 01:02:10,009
It's too dangerous.

1247
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:11,344
Nonsense!

1248
01:02:11,446 --> 01:02:13,713
Not when you've been
instructed by Niblick.

1249
01:02:18,086 --> 01:02:19,486
Who the hell is Niblick?

1250
01:02:19,588 --> 01:02:23,289
Niblick is my Sherpa
guide from the Himalayas.

1251
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:27,627
The Himalayas... the Himalayas!

1252
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:28,895
Look, there's the door.

1253
01:02:28,997 --> 01:02:30,597
Come on, let's go give it a try.

1254
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:35,870
It's open!

1255
01:02:44,913 --> 01:02:46,746
My god.

1256
01:02:47,816 --> 01:02:49,115
I killed him.

1257
01:02:49,217 --> 01:02:52,819
I'm supposed to take care
of him and I killed him.

1258
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:54,621
God!

1259
01:02:59,728 --> 01:03:01,227
The bond issue was a fraud.

1260
01:03:01,329 --> 01:03:03,496
The company went bankrupt.

1261
01:03:03,598 --> 01:03:04,976
They looked solid, but
they went belly up.

1262
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,867
Excuse me, have you seen that film...

1263
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:09,068
"Defender of the Crown"?

1264
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,570
Just like that...

1265
01:03:10,672 --> 01:03:12,483
The film... "Defender of the
Crown"... have you seen it?

1266
01:03:12,507 --> 01:03:15,174
Starring... what's
that guy's name?

1267
01:03:15,277 --> 01:03:20,246
Alan... Alan... Swann.

1269
01:03:20,348 --> 01:03:22,115
Yeah, Alan Swann!

1270
01:03:22,217 --> 01:03:24,918
Bill, I think Alan Swann's beneath us.

1271
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,020
Well, of course he's
beneath us, he's an actor.

1272
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:28,221
No, I mean, I think Alan.

1273
01:03:28,323 --> 01:03:29,889
Swann's beneath us right now.

1274
01:03:29,991 --> 01:03:32,225
Look!

1275
01:03:32,327 --> 01:03:34,594
Harry, get the hell out here!

1276
01:03:34,696 --> 01:03:37,764
Alan Swann is hanging from...
Something from the roof!

1277
01:03:37,866 --> 01:03:39,432
- Pull!
- Pull him up!

1278
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:40,199
Pull!

1279
01:03:40,302 --> 01:03:44,170
That's it, here he comes.

1280
01:03:44,272 --> 01:03:46,072
Good evening, do you have a light?

1281
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:49,542
Help me, help me!

1282
01:03:49,644 --> 01:03:50,644
Terrace?

1283
01:03:56,217 --> 01:03:57,417
Well done.

1284
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,385
We've just dropped in
to see the Downings.

1285
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,387
There are no Downings here.

1286
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:02,522
No Downings here?

1287
01:04:02,624 --> 01:04:03,624
No.

1288
01:04:07,095 --> 01:04:11,397
The Downing's are downstairs on 14.

1289
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:15,268
Close, Stone, very close.

1290
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:20,840
Mr. Swann, I think
I'm going to be unwell.

1291
01:04:20,942 --> 01:04:23,009
Stone, ladies are unwell.

1292
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:25,178
Gentlemen vomit.

1293
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:30,984
Alfredo, you needn't wait.

1294
01:04:31,086 --> 01:04:32,485
We shan't need the car anymore.

1295
01:04:32,587 --> 01:04:35,021
We're going to throw up in
the park and then walk home.

1296
01:05:04,452 --> 01:05:06,252
Mr. Swann, may
tell you something?

1297
01:05:07,722 --> 01:05:11,791
Benjy Stone is not who he seems to be.

1298
01:05:11,893 --> 01:05:13,493
Who is, Stone, who is?

1299
01:05:13,595 --> 01:05:16,429
But I'm not even Benjy Stone.

1300
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:19,365
I'm Benjamin Steinberg.

1301
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:21,112
I changed my name because
I thought it wouldn't

1302
01:05:21,136 --> 01:05:23,036
look good on the screen.

1303
01:05:23,138 --> 01:05:24,138
I'm a phony.

1304
01:05:24,172 --> 01:05:26,272
Because you changed your name?

1305
01:05:26,374 --> 01:05:28,274
What's in a name?

1306
01:05:28,376 --> 01:05:32,912
A rose by any other name
would wither and die.

1307
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:36,249
I'll give you a name... Clarence Duffy.

1309
01:05:36,351 --> 01:05:38,317
Clarence Duffy?

1310
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,886
Who's Clarence Duffy?

1311
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:42,722
He's a young man from
the west of Scotland...

1312
01:05:42,824 --> 01:05:45,291
Middle-class, Irish
descent, whose father

1313
01:05:45,393 --> 01:05:47,326
was a grammar school teacher.

1314
01:05:47,429 --> 01:05:49,295
His mother looked after her garden,

1315
01:05:49,397 --> 01:05:52,131
her husband, and her only son.

1316
01:05:52,233 --> 01:05:54,634
At the age of 18, he joined the Navy.

1317
01:05:54,736 --> 01:05:57,603
One year later, he
jumped ship in Liverpool,

1318
01:05:57,706 --> 01:06:00,473
has notions of becoming an actor,

1319
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,042
finishes up in English "B" movies.

1320
01:06:03,144 --> 01:06:06,512
Six months later, Lou
Goldmark of Paramount Studios

1321
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:10,049
announces his find, a
dashing new English actor

1322
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:12,952
to star in Paramount's
next big adventure film...

1323
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:15,221
"Swords of Glory."

1324
01:06:15,323 --> 01:06:16,522
Clarence Duffy.

1325
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:17,690
One and the same.

1326
01:06:17,792 --> 01:06:20,093
And you're not Allen Swann.

1327
01:06:20,195 --> 01:06:21,761
Yes, I am.

1328
01:06:25,834 --> 01:06:29,368
And you're the only
living soul who knows it.

1329
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:31,571
It dies with me, Clarence.

1330
01:06:36,411 --> 01:06:37,543
At least you're an actor.

1331
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:38,956
Actors are supposed to make up names.

1332
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,914
It's not just making
up a name, Stoneberg.

1333
01:06:42,016 --> 01:06:44,317
The studio made up an entire life for me,

1334
01:06:44,419 --> 01:06:45,918
and I let them do it.

1335
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,332
And now I can't tell where the
bogus one ends and the real one

1336
01:06:48,356 --> 01:06:49,522
begins.

1337
01:06:49,624 --> 01:06:51,924
Nothing about me is what it seems to be,

1338
01:06:52,026 --> 01:06:54,694
even the reason I'm doing your
"Comedy Cavalcade" program.

1339
01:06:54,796 --> 01:06:56,529
It's not because I wanted to.

1340
01:06:56,631 --> 01:06:58,397
It's a deal I made with my new partner,

1341
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,466
the Internal Revenue Service.

1342
01:07:00,568 --> 01:07:02,802
If I do the show and give
them half the proceeds,

1343
01:07:02,904 --> 01:07:05,571
they promise not to throw
me out of the country.

1344
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:07,907
Well, that dies with me, too, Duff.

1345
01:07:08,009 --> 01:07:10,343
Tonight, your mother
said, "shame on you,"

1346
01:07:10,445 --> 01:07:11,878
and she was right.

1347
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,614
I'm fed up with people letting
me get away with things,

1348
01:07:14,716 --> 01:07:16,749
and everybody does...
My friends, my agent,

1349
01:07:16,851 --> 01:07:18,451
my manager, my doctors...

1350
01:07:18,553 --> 01:07:20,052
my former wives, even my daughter.

1351
01:07:23,758 --> 01:07:27,693
Haven't we walked enough for one night?

1352
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:29,495
No... The horse, Stoneberg!

1354
01:07:29,597 --> 01:07:30,696
No, no, no, no!

1355
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:31,864
No!

1356
01:07:37,572 --> 01:07:40,840
You'll get 30 years for this.

1357
01:07:52,287 --> 01:07:53,019
Hey!

1358
01:07:53,121 --> 01:07:54,121
Hey!

1359
01:08:42,136 --> 01:08:43,136
No!

1360
01:09:41,996 --> 01:09:42,595
Tess!

1361
01:09:42,697 --> 01:09:44,463
Who's Tess?

1362
01:09:44,565 --> 01:09:47,066
Tess is his daughter.

1363
01:09:47,168 --> 01:09:50,136
Tess is his daughter in Connecticut!

1364
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,371
He went to Connecticut
on the day of the show.

1365
01:09:52,473 --> 01:09:54,307
The bastard went to Connecticut!

1366
01:09:54,409 --> 01:09:56,742
He's in another goddamn state!

1367
01:09:56,844 --> 01:10:01,013
I got to go down to the show
and tell Leo so he can fire me.

1368
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:02,115
I'm a dead man.

1369
01:10:04,519 --> 01:10:06,819
Can't I can't go like this.

1370
01:10:06,921 --> 01:10:07,921
I have to get dressed.

1371
01:10:18,599 --> 01:10:20,066
Don't forget your sweater.

1372
01:11:05,847 --> 01:11:06,912
Take me back.

1373
01:11:27,835 --> 01:11:28,934
Great.

1374
01:11:29,037 --> 01:11:31,470
Air day and our guest
star is no-show.

1375
01:11:31,572 --> 01:11:34,507
Hey, Leo, he's on the
cover of "TV Guide" this week.

1376
01:11:34,609 --> 01:11:35,674
Leo!

1377
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,346
Leo!

1378
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:44,717
Why is this sketch in here?

1379
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:46,730
We did this sketch last
week, but it's right in here,

1380
01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:47,553
right in my script.

1381
01:11:47,655 --> 01:11:48,721
Now, why, Leo?
Why?

1382
01:11:48,823 --> 01:11:49,722
Why is it in my script?

1383
01:11:49,824 --> 01:11:51,757
That is last week's script.

1384
01:11:56,431 --> 01:11:57,596
That's why it's in there.

1385
01:11:57,698 --> 01:11:59,932
And now, you'll find this week's script

1386
01:12:00,034 --> 01:12:01,333
in your dressing room, Stan.

1387
01:12:01,436 --> 01:12:02,168
That's good.

1388
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:03,035
That's good, Leo.

1389
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:05,538
OK.

1390
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,308
They're serving tongue at
lunch today, are they, Leo?

1391
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,676
No tongue on show day.

1392
01:12:10,778 --> 01:12:12,378
Twice, they served tongue on show day,

1393
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,480
twice the opening sketch died.

1394
01:12:14,582 --> 01:12:16,082
No tongue, get it?

1395
01:12:16,184 --> 01:12:17,416
No tongue.

1396
01:12:17,518 --> 01:12:20,019
Tongue... death!

1397
01:12:30,098 --> 01:12:33,299
Benjy, you were supposed
to be watching Swann.

1398
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:34,667
I was.

1399
01:12:34,769 --> 01:12:36,569
I even stayed in his suite last night.

1400
01:12:36,671 --> 01:12:39,004
But when I woke up today, he was gone.

1401
01:12:39,107 --> 01:12:41,207
He said he was going to see Tess.

1402
01:12:41,309 --> 01:12:41,907
Irish dame... figures.

1403
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:42,775
They love their booze.

1404
01:12:42,877 --> 01:12:44,043
She's 12.

1405
01:12:44,145 --> 01:12:46,512
Fine, now we can throw in statutory rape.

1406
01:12:46,614 --> 01:12:48,347
Tess happens to be his daughter.

1407
01:12:48,449 --> 01:12:49,782
Alfie, where is he?

1408
01:12:49,884 --> 01:12:51,283
He's in his dressing room.

1409
01:12:51,385 --> 01:12:51,951
Drunk.

1410
01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:53,385
He's taking a nap.

1411
01:12:53,488 --> 01:12:55,065
I'm going to see what
kind of an nap he's taking.

1412
01:12:55,089 --> 01:12:56,600
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, better let him rest.

1413
01:12:56,624 --> 01:12:59,558
He's got to be ready
for a run-through in an hour.

1414
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:00,660
Can he make it?

1415
01:13:00,761 --> 01:13:01,761
He'll make it.

1416
01:13:04,332 --> 01:13:05,898
Look, I know it's none of my business,

1417
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
but will you tell them to go easy on him?

1418
01:13:08,102 --> 01:13:11,137
I mean, it ain't been his best day.

1419
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:14,273
OK.

1420
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:15,375
Is he OK?

1421
01:13:15,443 --> 01:13:16,308
He's all right.

1422
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,810
You should have seen her...

1423
01:13:17,912 --> 01:13:19,445
12 and already a heartbreaker.

1424
01:13:19,547 --> 01:13:20,880
So what did he say to her?

1425
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:22,781
He never got out of the car.

1426
01:13:22,884 --> 01:13:26,285
And he don't say another
word for 86.4 miles.

1427
01:13:26,387 --> 01:13:27,920
I clocked him.

1428
01:13:28,022 --> 01:13:29,500
I didn't look in the rear view, neither.

1429
01:13:29,524 --> 01:13:30,524
I give him his privacy.

1430
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:46,472
All right, we open
on a tight to King and Cubby.

1431
01:13:46,574 --> 01:13:47,773
And then we widen out...

1432
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:49,108
We're set to open the house.

1433
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:53,479
15 minutes, everyone, 15 minutes.

1434
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,920
How you doing, Alan?

1435
01:14:01,022 --> 01:14:02,902
Look, I don't want you
to worry about a thing...

1436
01:14:02,957 --> 01:14:04,356
Bad rehearsal, good show.

1437
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:05,458
We've got a great cast.

1438
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:07,293
We got a great crew, and it always works.

1439
01:14:07,395 --> 01:14:09,528
Just remember, we're
going to have fun, right?

1440
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:13,432
And you, you look great.

1441
01:14:13,534 --> 01:14:14,433
What's he wearing this for?

1442
01:14:14,535 --> 01:14:16,769
The musketeer sketch.

1443
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:18,270
You in the right outfit?

1444
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:20,172
I am.

1445
01:14:20,274 --> 01:14:22,641
Then what am I doing in this?

1446
01:14:22,743 --> 01:14:24,877
I don't know.

1447
01:14:24,979 --> 01:14:26,478
Wait, which sketch is first?

1448
01:14:26,581 --> 01:14:30,816
The first sketch that I'm
in is the musketeers sketch.

1449
01:14:30,918 --> 01:14:35,054
I'm in that, too.

1450
01:14:35,156 --> 01:14:38,924
OK, I'm in the wrong outfit.

1451
01:14:39,026 --> 01:14:40,893
And look how I find out.

1452
01:14:40,995 --> 01:14:43,262
I've got to find out from this guy.

1453
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:48,934
Who were the geniuses who
are supposed to tell me

1454
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:50,869
which sketch comes first on my show,

1455
01:14:50,972 --> 01:14:53,405
and which outfit I'm supposed to be in?

1456
01:14:53,507 --> 01:14:54,507
Where are they?

1457
01:14:54,609 --> 01:14:57,343
Somebody tell me what sketch comes first!

1458
01:14:57,445 --> 01:14:58,711
Wardrobe!

1459
01:14:58,813 --> 01:15:00,279
Wardrobe!

1460
01:15:00,381 --> 01:15:00,913
Lil!

1461
01:15:01,015 --> 01:15:02,114
Listen to this.

1462
01:15:02,216 --> 01:15:04,149
He thinks he's in the wrong costume.

1463
01:15:04,252 --> 01:15:08,287
Every week, same
thing... he's so crazy.

1464
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:19,031
God.

1465
01:15:19,133 --> 01:15:20,453
Somebody help me with my costume?

1466
01:15:21,168 --> 01:15:22,168
Take it off!

1467
01:15:22,236 --> 01:15:23,269
No!

1468
01:15:23,371 --> 01:15:24,548
- Come on, take it off!
- No, leave me alone!

1469
01:15:24,572 --> 01:15:25,471
The Hijack sketch!

1470
01:15:25,573 --> 01:15:26,583
What, what, take what off?

1471
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:27,339
The Hijack sketch comes first.

1472
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:27,973
Which one?

1473
01:15:28,075 --> 01:15:29,108
The Hijack sketch.

1474
01:15:31,646 --> 01:15:34,513
It comes first.

1475
01:15:34,615 --> 01:15:36,515
I knew it.

1476
01:15:36,617 --> 01:15:38,050
I knew it, Leo.

1477
01:15:38,152 --> 01:15:39,630
Don't worry about a thing, pal.
Fine, OK.

1478
01:15:39,654 --> 01:15:40,654
- I knew it.
- Yeah, yeah.

1479
01:15:58,806 --> 01:15:59,806
Good.

1480
01:16:05,246 --> 01:16:07,413
Good.

1481
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:13,118
California?

1482
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,254
You can't write comedy in California.

1483
01:16:15,356 --> 01:16:17,289
It's not depressing enough.

1484
01:16:17,391 --> 01:16:18,857
You look great.

1485
01:16:18,959 --> 01:16:19,992
How do you feel?

1486
01:16:20,094 --> 01:16:21,427
I feel surprisingly well, Stone.

1487
01:16:21,529 --> 01:16:22,561
Thank you.

1488
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:24,463
So well, that I am going
to make a prediction.

1489
01:16:24,565 --> 01:16:26,877
Now, usually, it takes me two
or three takes just to warm up.

1490
01:16:26,901 --> 01:16:29,268
But tonight, I predict, we'll
get it on the first take.

1491
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:30,850
We always get it on the first take...

1492
01:16:30,938 --> 01:16:31,670
We have to.

1493
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:32,971
You do?

1494
01:16:33,074 --> 01:16:35,374
Sure, this is live television.

1495
01:16:35,476 --> 01:16:36,476
Live?

1496
01:16:39,914 --> 01:16:41,146
Live.

1497
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:43,449
What does 'live' mean?

1498
01:16:43,551 --> 01:16:46,185
It means at the exact moment
you're cavorting and leaping

1499
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:51,390
around that stage over there,
20 million people are seeing it.

1500
01:16:51,492 --> 01:16:53,625
Wait a minute.

1501
01:16:53,728 --> 01:16:54,993
Wait a minute.

1502
01:16:55,096 --> 01:16:57,162
Mr. Swann, you're white.

1503
01:16:57,264 --> 01:16:59,631
You mean it all goes into the camera lens

1504
01:16:59,734 --> 01:17:02,534
and then just spills out
into people's houses?

1505
01:17:02,636 --> 01:17:03,702
Yeah.

1506
01:17:03,804 --> 01:17:04,881
Why did nobody have the goodness

1507
01:17:04,905 --> 01:17:06,138
to explain this to me before?

1508
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,906
It's nothing to
worry about, Mr. Swann.

1509
01:17:08,008 --> 01:17:09,241
Our audiences are great.

1510
01:17:09,343 --> 01:17:10,909
Audience, what audience?
Audience?

1511
01:17:11,011 --> 01:17:12,222
You knew there was an audience.

1512
01:17:12,246 --> 01:17:13,790
What did you think those seats were for?

1513
01:17:13,814 --> 01:17:16,882
I haven't performed in front
of an audience for 28 years.

1514
01:17:16,984 --> 01:17:19,952
Audience?

1515
01:17:20,054 --> 01:17:21,887
I played a butler.

1516
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:23,222
I had one line!

1517
01:17:26,761 --> 01:17:27,626
I forgot it.

1518
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:28,594
Look, don't worry.

1519
01:17:28,696 --> 01:17:29,595
This is going to be easy.

1520
01:17:29,697 --> 01:17:30,963
For you, maybe, not for me.

1521
01:17:31,065 --> 01:17:33,866
I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star!

1522
01:17:37,238 --> 01:17:38,871
Five minutes to air.

1523
01:17:38,973 --> 01:17:40,639
Ready for the Boss Hijack sketch.

1524
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:41,840
Shut up!

1525
01:17:41,942 --> 01:17:44,143
Look, you can do it!

1526
01:17:44,245 --> 01:17:48,180
I need time to think.

1527
01:17:48,282 --> 01:17:49,915
I need time to think.

1528
01:17:50,017 --> 01:17:51,150
Holy mother.

1529
01:17:51,252 --> 01:17:52,851
I need time to think!

1530
01:17:52,953 --> 01:17:54,787
Is that think or drink?

1531
01:17:54,889 --> 01:17:55,889
Yes!

1532
01:18:02,897 --> 01:18:04,329
He's got the jitters.

1533
01:18:04,432 --> 01:18:06,932
Ladies and gentlemen, a scant
second ago, Alan Swann had

1534
01:18:07,034 --> 01:18:08,467
a full-fledged anxiety attack.

1535
01:18:08,569 --> 01:18:10,602
An inch away from a
complete nervous breakdown,

1536
01:18:10,704 --> 01:18:14,940
and this one has the nerve to
describe it as 'the jitters'!

1537
01:18:15,042 --> 01:18:15,941
What are you doing?

1538
01:18:16,043 --> 01:18:18,043
Drinking and leaving.

1539
01:18:18,145 --> 01:18:19,578
There he goes again.

1540
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,281
The musketeers sketch
is on after the Hijack sketch.

1541
01:18:22,383 --> 01:18:23,749
I'm not doing the muscatel sketch.

1542
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:24,683
The musketeer sketch.

1543
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:25,984
I'm not doing either!

1544
01:18:40,034 --> 01:18:41,700
Wasn't that Alan Swann leaving?

1545
01:18:41,802 --> 01:18:45,704
Obviously, he's still in
the throes of 'the jitters.'

1546
01:18:45,806 --> 01:18:46,839
Get out of my way, Sy.

1547
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:47,941
Not until you pay up.

1548
01:18:47,975 --> 01:18:49,074
Opening dancers.

1549
01:18:49,176 --> 01:18:50,776
Benjy, what happened?

1550
01:18:50,878 --> 01:18:52,211
Swann's gone.

1551
01:18:52,313 --> 01:18:53,545
Can't speak, talk later.

1552
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:55,747
You little smart-ass
son of a bitch bastard!

1553
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,649
You're through here!

1554
01:18:57,751 --> 01:18:59,485
I'm telling King!

1555
01:18:59,587 --> 01:19:02,020
Sy!

1556
01:19:02,122 --> 01:19:03,288
Where's KC?

1557
01:19:06,227 --> 01:19:07,993
Everything OK?

1558
01:19:08,095 --> 01:19:09,294
Good.

1559
01:19:09,396 --> 01:19:10,696
Thank you, Harmonaires.

1560
01:19:10,798 --> 01:19:11,597
Thank you.

1561
01:19:11,699 --> 01:19:13,398
This is places, people.

1562
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:15,367
Come on, people, let's hurry up.

1563
01:19:15,469 --> 01:19:17,769
Dancers, opening dancers, you should

1564
01:19:17,872 --> 01:19:19,204
be in your starting places.

1565
01:19:19,306 --> 01:19:21,740
Hurry along, thank you.

1566
01:19:21,842 --> 01:19:23,075
Who are you?

1567
01:19:23,177 --> 01:19:24,743
Yeah.
You're Phil somebody, right?

1568
01:19:24,845 --> 01:19:25,577
Yeah, I know you.

1569
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:26,411
Go ahead.

1570
01:19:26,514 --> 01:19:27,746
You're doing a good job, Phil.

1571
01:19:30,751 --> 01:19:33,385
Sy, Sy, I'm sorry.

1572
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:34,686
Help! Help!

1573
01:19:34,788 --> 01:19:35,387
Help!

1574
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:36,822
We need some help here.

1575
01:19:36,924 --> 01:19:41,360
Look, Sy, you shouldn't
sneak up on a guy like that.

1576
01:19:41,462 --> 01:19:43,629
I know you can't hear me,
pal, but when you wake up,

1577
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:46,865
I'm going to give you a nice raise.

1578
01:19:46,967 --> 01:19:49,001
Get him some first aid.

1579
01:19:49,103 --> 01:19:51,770
What a putz.

1580
01:19:51,872 --> 01:19:54,139
Terrible, terrible.

1581
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:12,858
Alfredo!

1582
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,960
Alfredo.

1583
01:20:13,994 --> 01:20:18,130
Alfredo, I... you're not Alfredo.

1584
01:20:18,232 --> 01:20:19,398
Mr. Swann.

1585
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,100
My god, it's Stoneberger.

1586
01:20:22,202 --> 01:20:23,246
Will you ever let me alone?

1587
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:24,447
As soon as you finish the show.

1588
01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:25,804
I'm not doing the show.

1589
01:20:25,906 --> 01:20:27,026
I want to go to the Waldorf!

1590
01:20:27,107 --> 01:20:28,173
You have to do the show.

1591
01:20:28,275 --> 01:20:29,775
If you don't, they'll deport you.

1592
01:20:29,877 --> 01:20:33,946
It doesn't matter.

1593
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,014
That's a sad sight.

1594
01:20:36,116 --> 01:20:39,351
You're a sadder sight.

1595
01:20:39,453 --> 01:20:41,613
All you end up doing is making
anyone who cares for you

1596
01:20:41,655 --> 01:20:42,655
unhappy.

1597
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:44,823
You know what they
say about me, Stoneberg.

1598
01:20:44,925 --> 01:20:46,525
You can depend on Alan Swann.

1599
01:20:46,627 --> 01:20:48,093
He will always let you down.

1600
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:49,995
Did you tell Tess that?

1601
01:20:50,097 --> 01:20:51,163
That's right.

1602
01:20:51,265 --> 01:20:52,564
You couldn't get out of the car.

1603
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:59,438
Alfie, take this bum to the Waldorf.

1604
01:21:11,819 --> 01:21:16,088
Ladies, ladies, let's go, let's go.

1605
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:17,889
Nancy, you have a nice show.

1606
01:21:20,728 --> 01:21:23,095
Sy, didn't I tell you not to sneak up...!

1607
01:21:23,197 --> 01:21:24,997
Mr. Rojeck wanted
you to have that.

1608
01:21:25,933 --> 01:21:26,933
And that.

1609
01:21:40,547 --> 01:21:43,015
We have 10 seconds to go.

1610
01:21:43,117 --> 01:21:44,983
Just in case anybody has to...

1611
01:21:46,453 --> 01:21:50,455
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1612
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:54,493
This is NBC, the
National Broadcasting Company.

1613
01:21:54,595 --> 01:21:55,727
Cue music, ready one.

1614
01:21:55,829 --> 01:21:56,461
Up, ready two.

1615
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:58,063
Cue announcer.
Two!

1616
01:21:58,165 --> 01:21:59,843
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is Saturday night at 8:00.

1617
01:21:59,867 --> 01:22:02,067
The National Broadcasting
Company presents.

1618
01:22:02,169 --> 01:22:04,069
"The Comedy Cavalcade."

1619
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:05,537
82, 81...

1620
01:22:05,639 --> 01:22:08,473
Starring King
Kaiser with his special guest

1621
01:22:08,575 --> 01:22:10,409
star, Alan Swann!

1622
01:22:14,014 --> 01:22:15,480
Now let's roll film.

1623
01:22:21,221 --> 01:22:22,554
Take it!

1624
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:25,257
When you eat lunch too
quickly, as this fellow had,

1625
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:29,027
then you're apt to be cranky,
'cause your stomach feels bad.

1626
01:22:33,467 --> 01:22:34,566
Stone.

1627
01:22:37,271 --> 01:22:38,271
I'm afraid.

1628
01:22:41,141 --> 01:22:43,175
I'm afraid.

1629
01:22:43,277 --> 01:22:44,587
That's why couldn't get out of the car

1630
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:48,113
to see my Tess, my child.

1631
01:22:48,215 --> 01:22:50,415
Alan Swann, afraid?

1632
01:22:50,517 --> 01:22:51,983
"The Defender of the Crown"?

1633
01:22:52,086 --> 01:22:53,218
"Captain From Tortuga"?

1634
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,487
"The Last knight of the Round Table"?

1635
01:22:55,589 --> 01:22:58,056
Those are movies, damn you!

1636
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:00,325
Look at me.

1637
01:23:00,427 --> 01:23:04,229
I'm flesh and blood,
life-size, no larger.

1638
01:23:04,331 --> 01:23:07,132
I'm not that silly goddamned hero.

1639
01:23:07,234 --> 01:23:08,266
I never was.

1640
01:23:08,368 --> 01:23:09,735
To me, you were.

1641
01:23:09,837 --> 01:23:11,503
Whoever you were in those movies,

1642
01:23:11,605 --> 01:23:16,475
those silly goddamn
heroes meant a lot to me.

1643
01:23:16,577 --> 01:23:18,844
What does it matter
if it was an illusion?

1644
01:23:18,946 --> 01:23:20,345
It worked.

1645
01:23:20,447 --> 01:23:23,582
So don't tell me this
is you, life-size.

1646
01:23:23,684 --> 01:23:26,985
I can't use you life-size.

1647
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:31,223
I need Alan Swann's as
big as I can get them.

1648
01:23:31,325 --> 01:23:33,759
And let me tell you something.

1649
01:23:33,861 --> 01:23:35,460
You couldn't have convinced me the way

1650
01:23:35,562 --> 01:23:38,964
you did unless somewhere in
you, you hat that courage.

1651
01:23:39,066 --> 01:23:41,800
Nobody's that good an actor.

1652
01:23:41,902 --> 01:23:44,402
You are that silly goddamned hero.

1653
01:23:48,475 --> 01:23:51,309
Keep it down, back
here, we're on the air!

1654
01:23:51,411 --> 01:23:54,079
Come back, go get some help!

1655
01:23:54,181 --> 01:23:55,046
You're fired!

1656
01:23:55,149 --> 01:23:56,548
Boss Hijack!

1657
01:23:59,686 --> 01:24:01,653
- Who owns the gray '51 DeSoto?
- The new guy...

1658
01:24:01,755 --> 01:24:02,621
Harry.

1659
01:24:02,723 --> 01:24:04,043
You parked in Boss Hijack's spot.

1660
01:24:04,391 --> 01:24:05,657
You better move.

1661
01:24:09,129 --> 01:24:11,396
What the hell is that?

1662
01:24:11,498 --> 01:24:13,398
Help!

1663
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:19,371
You're lucky we're on the second floor...

1664
01:24:19,473 --> 01:24:20,939
It slowed him down.

1665
01:24:25,813 --> 01:24:29,581
You're very lucky we're
on the second floor,

1666
01:24:29,683 --> 01:24:31,616
it really slowed him down.

1667
01:24:31,718 --> 01:24:33,285
One, where's King?

1668
01:24:33,387 --> 01:24:34,119
Cue King.

1669
01:24:34,221 --> 01:24:35,221
Cue him.

1670
01:24:35,255 --> 01:24:38,089
Well, what's it going to do?

1671
01:24:39,059 --> 01:24:40,059
Slow him down.

1672
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,160
Slow him down.

1673
01:24:50,237 --> 01:24:51,237
Murder!

1674
01:25:00,414 --> 01:25:01,479
Holy, Jesus.

1675
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:07,819
Boss Hijack...

1676
01:25:12,793 --> 01:25:13,325
One!

1677
01:25:13,427 --> 01:25:14,226
What is this?

1678
01:25:14,328 --> 01:25:15,060
What's happening?

1679
01:25:15,162 --> 01:25:16,162
Three!

1680
01:25:21,335 --> 01:25:23,201
Don't come in here.

1681
01:25:38,018 --> 01:25:39,417
Three!

1682
01:25:39,519 --> 01:25:40,752
Two!

1683
01:25:40,854 --> 01:25:41,453
One!

1684
01:25:41,555 --> 01:25:43,355
What's happening?

1685
01:25:43,457 --> 01:25:44,756
What the hell is happening?

1686
01:25:44,858 --> 01:25:48,293
What the hell's happening?

1687
01:25:57,971 --> 01:26:01,506
Rojeck's men are killing King.

1688
01:26:09,816 --> 01:26:12,550
What is Swann doing in the balcony?

1689
01:26:12,653 --> 01:26:14,097
Get a light on him.
Get a light on him.

1690
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:15,601
In the
balcony... he's in the balcony.

1691
01:26:15,689 --> 01:26:17,022
Take three... good!

1692
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:19,125
Porthole!

1693
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:22,261
Swann?

1694
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:46,685
Will you hold my sword?

1695
01:26:46,787 --> 01:26:48,286
Thank you very much.

1696
01:27:06,707 --> 01:27:08,273
The police.

1697
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,574
You heard me.

1698
01:27:09,676 --> 01:27:11,376
Loosen up on three,
loosen up and... three!

1699
01:27:11,478 --> 01:27:13,912
God, this makes me happy.

1700
01:27:17,284 --> 01:27:18,016
Two!

1701
01:27:18,118 --> 01:27:19,118
Do as I told you!

1702
01:27:37,471 --> 01:27:38,937
What took you so long?

1703
01:27:44,244 --> 01:27:47,312
Ladies and gentlemen, Alan Swann.

1704
01:28:15,108 --> 01:28:16,108
Two.

1705
01:28:18,745 --> 01:28:21,379
And one.

1706
01:28:21,481 --> 01:28:22,481
Two.

1707
01:28:44,071 --> 01:28:46,304
The way you see him here, like this,

1708
01:28:46,406 --> 01:28:49,174
this is the way I like to remember him.

1709
01:28:49,276 --> 01:28:52,210
I think if you had asked Alan
Swann what was the single most

1710
01:28:52,312 --> 01:28:55,547
gratifying moment in his life,
he might have said this one,

1711
01:28:55,649 --> 01:28:57,182
right here.

1712
01:28:57,284 --> 01:28:59,751
The next day, I drove up to
Connecticut with him and Alfie.

1713
01:28:59,853 --> 01:29:01,953
This time he knocked on the door.

1714
01:29:02,055 --> 01:29:03,755
And when he and Tess saw each other,

1715
01:29:03,857 --> 01:29:06,524
it was like they'd never been apart.

1716
01:29:06,626 --> 01:29:11,396
Like Alfie says, with Swann,
you forgive a lot, you know?

1717
01:29:11,498 --> 01:29:12,797
I know.
