1
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:08,179
a loving father, a doting grandfather
and loyal friend.

2
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:12,147
I was lucky enough
to spend some time with Arthur

3
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:13,586
towards the end of his illness

4
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:18,576
and, despite the sad circumstances,
I always looked forward to those visits,

5
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:22,982
knowing that I would be greeted
with the joy and happiness

6
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:25,384
for which he and lrene were so...

7
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:27,298
Look, I'm sorry, this won't do.

8
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:30,145
This family is grieving.
You need to show some more respect.

9
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:33,543
This family has paid
for a high-quality funeral video.

10
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:35,339
A lasting memory of a fond farewell.

11
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:40,818
I got you as far as, "l always used
to look forward to the visits."

12
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:43,665
Look, go away.

13
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:47,858
Piss off!

14
00:00:47,907 --> 00:00:51,900
Yeah, Bags, I think we've got enough.
This family needs some space to grieve.

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,143
OK.

16
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,462
Good job. Thanks, everyone,
for your patience.

17
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:58,101
That's great. Could you not look
directly in the camera?

18
00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:00,342
I told you to piss off!

19
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:20,979
Hey, Baggy! Wait up!

20
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:23,175
Bags!

21
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:27,584
All right?

22
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:29,424
So, good news.

23
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:33,016
Fat Kenny Radford's grandmother died.
Her funeral's on Saturday. Are you in?

24
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:37,464
No. Right.

25
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:40,465
I still think it's a good idea.
Everyone's doing wedding videos.

26
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:43,897
Funeral videos are a niche market.
We just got a touchy family.

27
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:45,585
I just want to make my own film.

28
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,619
Come on, Bags. Do you think
George Lucas never struggled?

29
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:52,421
Ridley Scott, right, had to sell a lung
to buy his first camera. That's a fact.

30
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,178
We'll laugh about this
when we shoot The Love Storm.

31
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:56,580
Are we? Are we?

32
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:00,501
There he is,
having a little laugh already. Good.

33
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:03,937
We'll make the first Oscar-winning
end-of-term project in history.

34
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:06,782
We can't stop now, man. We're this close.

35
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,102
You are going to be up on that podium,
thanking your mum,

36
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:11,024
your agent, your producer.

37
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,778
Thank you? Thanking you for what?

38
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,498
- Making me do shit I don't want to do?
- Bags, you're welcome.

39
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,744
Uncovering The Language Of A Visual Event.

40
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,823
Yep, I know what you're thinking.

41
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,984
A major yawnathon, but hear me out,
because this stuff

42
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:30,425
is effing cool.

43
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:34,341
So, fasten your seatbelts, we're about
to take a trip into the avant-garde.

44
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:38,103
In the words of Vanilla lce,
"Stop, collaborate and listen,"

45
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:41,662
because the film I'm about to show you
here is important for two reasons.

46
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:42,903
Uno.

47
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:47,338
It paved the way for the experimental
Austrian animation of the 1 950s.

48
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:50,506
And, dos, it's a short film.

49
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:55,143
The very same medium we shall be
exploring in our end-of-year projects.

50
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:58,259
"What's that, Mr D? Short films? Two minutes? "

51
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,138
"No sweat. Easy."

52
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:02,337
Wrong, sailor, incorrect.

53
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:05,618
Because it's not about how long it is. Is it?

54
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:08,465
It's about what you do with it.

55
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:18,302
So, yeah, granted, it's slightly different
from previous years, shorter.

56
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,781
But it's a challenging format and l...

57
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:24,581
Excuse me, Mr Dulberg, sorry.
Our script's a feature film, 90 minutes.

58
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:29,943
Well, if it isn't Leatherhead's
very own Spielberg and Weinstein.

59
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,983
We've been working on it for three years.

60
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:33,665
Yes, sorry about that, lads.

61
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:36,141
My bad. I think you've got some editing to do.

62
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:38,462
What? To two minutes?

63
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:40,862
Guys, can we,
can we have a bit of realism here?

64
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:45,298
This is Leatherhead University, OK? Not UCLA.

65
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:47,656
If you want a calling card, go to the printer's.

66
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:53,104
Maybe it's for the best, darling.

67
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,183
It was going to be our ticket to Hollywood.

68
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:58,616
- Can I speak for you, Val?
- Always, Stephen.

69
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:05,179
The entertainment industry is
an impossible road, full of obstacles.

70
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:09,096
Now, we admire your ambition, Joe.
Ambition is everything.

71
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:10,626
You've got to follow your dream.

72
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:15,457
That way, when you fail, you can always say,
"Well, at least I tried."

73
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:18,057
Gotcha. Thanks, Dad.

74
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,701
Why don't you come in to work
with me tomorrow?

75
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:25,137
Get the feel of the place. Start learning
the ropes. It might cheer you up a bit.

76
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:28,065
That's a wonderful idea, Dad.

77
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:30,098
Joe?

78
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:31,500
Yeah, Dad, it sounds great,

79
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,466
but I think I've got to...

80
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,258
do things all day.

81
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,538
Well, let's do it soon, all right?

82
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:42,977
Term ends in a couple of months and
then I want you trained up, quick-smart.

83
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:45,257
After that, it's you and me.

84
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:47,901
Clarke & Son School of Motoring.

85
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:52,304
Seven top-of-the-range Fiestas.
Walnut dash and a growing client base.

86
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,138
You're set for life.

87
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:10,618
Could you two find somewhere else to mope?
You're depressing the regulars.

88
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,704
Three years of film school, Lila,
and I'll end up a driving instructor.

89
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,066
At least it's a job, Joe.

90
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,575
- It's a shit job.
- It's an amazing job.

91
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,979
It's the only job that is not only extremely boring,
but, at the same time, very, very dangerous.

92
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:25,619
- I'll be trapped in Leatherhead forever.
- Hey, hey, don't knock Leatherhead.

93
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,943
Sure, Hollywood's all right,
but do they have a Kebabsolutely?

94
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:30,181
Does it have a big Tesco?

95
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:34,502
No. No, you're right, it's rubbish.
It's all just bright lights

96
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:37,539
and cool parties and premieres
and beautiful women.

97
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,021
Grace Kelly, Cameron Diaz. Jessica Rabbit.

98
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,659
Yeah, you know you would.
You'd do Jessica Rabbit in a heartbeat.

99
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:49,545
You two are pathetic.
You go on and on about Hollywood,

100
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:51,976
but all you ever do is sit around here
bugging me all day.

101
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:53,380
You're all bark and no bite.

102
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,463
"All fart and no follow through,"
as my gran would say.

103
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:57,941
I follow through. I am doing stuff.

104
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:00,827
- Pestering the recently bereaved?
- It's a niche market.

105
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,017
What I'm saying is,
why are you letting some bitter, jealous,

106
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,297
dead-end college lecturer stand in your way?

107
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:10,498
Did Tarantino ask his teacher for
permission to make Reservoir Dogs?

108
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,026
London is 20 miles down the road,

109
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,786
crammed full of film companies
desperate for good ideas.

110
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:16,146
Yeah.

111
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:17,859
Bags, don't be so negative.

112
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:22,059
No, no, you're right. We need to get out there.
We need to get up in their faces.

113
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:23,779
Let's take this mountain to Mohammed.

114
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:27,103
Baggy, start the car,
because we are going to London.

115
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:33,744
The film industry is just like
any other business, Bags.

116
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,699
It's all about supply and demand.

117
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:40,060
Film companies demand a great script and we
are about to supply them with exactly that.

118
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:42,696
We're like a dream come true for these guys.

119
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:44,738
And we're going straight to the big dogs.

120
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:48,985
Working Title. The most successful
British film company ever.

121
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:02,463
So, we're just going to walk in there,
pitch the film and get the money?

122
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,498
Come on, Bags, don't be so negative.

123
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:07,345
It's like God said to Moses,
"You've got to have faith."

124
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:09,299
Wasn't that the fella from Wham?

125
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,907
- No, Moses was never in Wham.
- No, I mean...

126
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:17,177
Hi, there. Joe Clarke, producer.

127
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:20,258
Oh, my God, do men get lost in your eyes?

128
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:25,064
If you keep pointing those things at me, I'm
going to need a search party, because I am lost.

129
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,742
And I'm hungry.
I may have to eat my friend here.

130
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,546
Tasty!

131
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:32,498
Hello, Working Title.

132
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,737
Yes.

133
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:40,017
Wonderful.
OK, Chris, putting you through.

134
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:44,577
- Sorry, sir. You were saying?
- I may have to eat my friend here.

135
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,064
What?

136
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:49,143
Because of the eyes thing.

137
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:51,106
You've got massive eyes.

138
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:56,300
- Sorry, can I help you?
- Yes, we're here to pitch a movie.

139
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:59,862
- Right. Do you have an appointment?
- No, but we do have a fantastic script.

140
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:02,701
- Really?
- Yes. It's perfect for Working Title.

141
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,263
Hang on, because we're Working Title.

142
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:06,815
This is fantastic news.

143
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:10,576
I'll ring Mr Bevan and Mr Fellner,
the head of the company, really important.

144
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:14,666
They're in a big meeting with Universal Studios,
but I'm sure they won't mind if I drag them out.

145
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:17,267
I'm going to get them
to read your script straight away,

146
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:20,105
then the guys and the girls
can start casting and budgeting

147
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:22,377
and we'll all go out for champagne
and teppanyaki.

148
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:26,018
- Are you being sarcastic?
- Yes, I am.

149
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,980
You do need an appointment.

150
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:30,495
I can't see your name here, Mr Clarke.

151
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:32,777
- I'm sorry.
- Well, keep looking.

152
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:36,706
Just think, they could have stopped checking at
Preparation G - they would have had nothing.

153
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:40,459
No? OK. Well, Mr Brown,
it looks like we're in trouble.

154
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:43,858
- Our appointment's not in the book.
- Are you lan Brown?

155
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:46,779
I'm Mr Brown.

156
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,866
I'm terribly sorry.
It's under Mr Brown's name and not yours.

157
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,181
- 1 1 o'clock to see Graham Rose?
- That's right.

158
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,502
- Do you want to go through?
- Yes. Thank you.

159
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,943
It's The Big Chill meets Remains Of The Day.

160
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:03,705
It's kind of a noir romance,
but with elements of Welles, Capra, Soderbergh.

161
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,658
It's a drama, but it's witty.

162
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,461
Classic themes, but with a contemporary edge.

163
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,225
Baggy, set the stage.

164
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:12,864
Night. Thunder.

165
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,497
Lightning. Rain.

166
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:19,742
A secluded farmhouse on the edge of town.
Our heroine walks to the door.

167
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:22,665
Hands bound, face muddied,
a haunted look in her eye.

168
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:24,659
This is the story of an enigmatic woman

169
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:27,858
who enters the lives of two people
and changes them forever.

170
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,467
- Enemies become friends...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

171
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:32,498
I've got to be honest with you, Mr Brown.

172
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,266
I thought you were just going
to sell me some print cartridges.

173
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:38,704
That's it, Joe. I want to go home now.

174
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,897
Do you know how long it took
Attenborough to make Gandhi?

175
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,665
It took him ten, long, painful years

176
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:46,221
and we've been at it for, like,
two and a half hours.

177
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:49,546
The good news is we're not making
some boring, cry-baby movie

178
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,543
about a bald bloke in a nappy.

179
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:54,226
Yeah, I know it was a masterpiece,
but you get the picture.

180
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:56,303
Full steam ahead, my friend, full steam...

181
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:58,499
Bags! Bags!

182
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:01,179
It's like a sign.

183
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:02,776
It is a sign.

184
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:09,700
If you're looking for Angeline, she's next door.
I should warn you, she used to be a bloke.

185
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:12,136
No, we've come to see you,
Mr President, sir.

186
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:14,257
We're filmmakers. We've got an appointment.

187
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,946
Producer Joe Clarke.
This is the director, John Bagley.

188
00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:19,502
We've got a very exciting project for you,
The Love Storm.

189
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,219
Baggy, do the pitch.

190
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,986
Night. Thunder. Lightning. Rain.

191
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:26,746
- Show these two wankers the door.
- No, no. Look...

192
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:29,460
I know you're a very busy man,
but we just want two minutes.

193
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:33,261
This is a great pitch.
We're talking big money, yeah?

194
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,502
Accolades. Awards.

195
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,424
All right, Tweedledee. Two minutes. Go.

196
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,185
Night. Thunder.

197
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:41,104
Lightning. Rain.

198
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:43,581
A secluded farmhouse on the edge of town.

199
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,379
This is the story of an enigmatic woman

200
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:48,464
who enters the lives of two people
and changes them forever.

201
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:52,022
Enemies become friends.
Friends become lovers.

202
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,740
- She was a stranger...
- Then she shagged the lot of them.

203
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:59,859
Yeah. Am I sensing there isn't enough
sex in this movie for you?

204
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:02,865
You two tadpoles come wandering in
off the street like Hansel and Gretel.

205
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:06,456
You've got chutzpah, I like that.
I give you two minutes, you never know.

206
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:09,340
You might have some girl next door
banging yard dogs.

207
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:11,378
Or a colony of midget friends
shagging each other.

208
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,304
You're calling it ltty Bitty Gang Bang.

209
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:15,383
Then you start talking about awards,

210
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,941
without one single mention
of the word "pussy".

211
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,546
Do you see that?

212
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:24,775
Now that is the only thing that gets the
Academy's juices flowing around here.

213
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,900
- Candy Fiveways.
- Do you know who Candy Fiveways is?

214
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:32,256
Yes. She was in I Candy 2.

215
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:34,025
- And?
- And...

216
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,099
It was her sexiest role yet.

217
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,297
"We laughed, we cried,
we tugged ourselves dry."

218
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:42,544
Listen, Candy Fiveways is the biggest
name in adult entertainment.

219
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:45,226
The patron saint of the old Nescafe handshake.

220
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,859
She's got three Cocks.

221
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,984
Golden Cockerels. The Oscars
of the adult entertainment industry.

222
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:53,938
A first-class ticket to the big time.

223
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,822
Now, if you had her in your film,
we could do business,

224
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,585
but you don't, so we can't and I'm a busy man.

225
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:00,663
Now your two minutes ended two minutes ago.

226
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:02,459
Robby, sling 'em out.

227
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:12,018
That went well. We just got a movie offer.

228
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:14,462
What?

229
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:16,463
In amongst the tough-guy stuff was a message.

230
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:19,260
"A bit of a rewrite, the right cast,
we'll make your movie."

231
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:21,457
No. No, no. No way.

232
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,657
No, I can't make a film like that.

233
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:27,063
Everybody started somewhere.
What's wrong with starting in erotica?

234
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,905
Not a chance. I can't do that.

235
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:38,461
You don't have to do that.
The actress will do that.

236
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,858
Baggy, don't give up on me now.

237
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:45,421
Sex does not automatically
ruin the movie.

238
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:49,221
Well, Scorsese did have to cut
nude shots into his first feature.

239
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,382
There you go.

240
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:53,260
They all did.
You could take porn apart, give it a heart.

241
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,504
Could reinvent the genre for
a cine-literate, postmodern audience.

242
00:12:56,547 --> 00:13:00,176
Or you could take the The Love Storm
and pop in some shagging.

243
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:03,864
- Hello, we're home! Hi, Baggy.
- Hi, fellas. How's it going?

244
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:06,906
You missed another exciting day
at Clarke's School of Motoring.

245
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:08,858
Three passes and one fail.

246
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:10,860
- What are you watching?
- This?

247
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:14,217
It's nothing. Just some stuff for college.
Quite boring, actually.

248
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:17,307
I see. One of those old,
black-and-white foreign jobs?

249
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:20,259
- A little bit highbrow, is it?
- Yeah, something like that.

250
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,775
- Where's the remote?
- You had it. Find it. Make it stop.

251
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:27,776
- We like a good thriller, don't we, Valerie?
- Or a comedy. I do love that Ben Stiller.

252
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:30,102
Yes! Yes! Yes!

253
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,777
Well, then, you wouldn't be interested in this.

254
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:39,183
This is just academic, highbrow, intellectual stuff.

255
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:46,176
Yes, that's right. Nothing like a good comedy.

256
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:48,145
We love a good laugh.

257
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,980
Soapy Tit Wank.

258
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,421
- You call this highbrow?
- Yes.

259
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:56,941
Yeah, that's...

260
00:13:56,987 --> 00:14:01,265
That's a Czechoslovakian, pre-war,
monochrome, low-budget movie...

261
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:03,824
about hygiene.

262
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:10,379
The Shawshank Redemption.
Tragically overlooked by the Oscars.

263
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:13,500
American Beauty.
Well, Kevin Spacey is amazing in that.

264
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,864
Shaving Ryan's Privates?

265
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:18,863
Baggy, Shaving Ryan's Privates?

266
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,298
- Research material.
- Research material?

267
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:24,941
Do you want American Beauty and Shawshank
or just that?

268
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:27,057
No. Yeah. Of course I do.

269
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:31,146
It really is research for my script, you know,
The Love Storm.

270
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:34,937
The Love Storm?
Isn't that a psychological romance, with a girl?

271
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:39,299
Yeah, except the narrative has expanded
to accommodate a sub genre.

272
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:42,225
Genre splicing. Good idea.
Increase your potential audience.

273
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,019
It's more of a character piece.

274
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,501
So, more emotional depth?
It still doesn't explain...

275
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,262
It's more of a porn film.

276
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:54,985
Right, right, a porn film. You should have said.
But you don't want Shaving Ryan's Privates.

277
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,460
A I bit too much cock in that one.

278
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:59,817
But if you want to know about porn,
I'll tell you about porn. Come round.

279
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,818
Welcome to my world.

280
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,218
This'll be a voyage of discovery for you, boy.

281
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:16,576
- Hi, I've come to meet Miss Fiveways.
- I wish I could help, but she isn't here.

282
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:20,662
You're good. You are very good.

283
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:24,064
A Candy Fiveways film. Your address.

284
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:27,224
- Busted.
- No, we're the distribution company.

285
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,701
We distribute films made by other people.

286
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,106
You distribute?

287
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:35,860
That's excellento.
That's valuable work, distribution.

288
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,264
But you must know how to get hold of her.

289
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:40,423
- Do you have a number?
- We're not really supposed...

290
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:41,661
Tiffany.

291
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,096
Hey, it's me. It's Joe. Remember?

292
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,102
Hey, look, there. Look at that smile!

293
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:50,542
That smile is wasted here.
You should be in movies.

294
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:52,145
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

295
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:55,257
Come on. How about that number?

296
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:57,218
I'm not really supposed to, but...

297
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:00,656
we do have a number here for...

298
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,425
Fiveways lnternational.

299
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,661
This is it.

300
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:04,856
Tiffany?

301
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:09,378
Without you, this company would sink
without a trace and you know it.

302
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,863
Love you, Tiffany Thomas.

303
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:13,704
And I love you...

304
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:16,900
Joe Clarke.

305
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:26,662
Fiveways lnternational. Clive Purves.

306
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:30,143
Hello there, Clive. Tell me,
do you handle Candy Fiveways?

307
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:33,015
- Yes, we do.
- Excellent!

308
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,661
I'm a film producer, making a film and...

309
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:37,620
Well, how do I put this?

310
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:39,221
I want Candy.

311
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:41,940
Well, let me see. Candy Fiveways...

312
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:43,616
Yeah.

313
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:49,139
She's available. Do you want single entry,
double entry or the full executive?

314
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:51,939
- As in?
- Well, sir, the more you spend,

315
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:53,500
the more positions are possible.

316
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,538
I mean, she does it all, but for a price.

317
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:58,624
Yes, silly of me. I don't think we should
limit ourselves at this stage.

318
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,659
- How much for the full executive?
- Let me see. Full executive...

319
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:03,663
£250 plus VAT.

320
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,298
So, it's that easy?

321
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,985
Tell me, what's she like?

322
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:15,545
Well, she's got blonde hair,

323
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:17,225
red lips,

324
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:18,825
a nice bum.

325
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:21,017
Is she smart? You know, funny?

326
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,620
She's a doll.

327
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,180
Yeah.

328
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,546
I hear you.

329
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,182
Adult entertainment, erotica, blue movies,
you can call it what you want.

330
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:36,502
Essentially, all porno is exactly the same.

331
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:39,425
It's boy meets girl. They kiss.

332
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:43,142
She smokes a little cock, he eats
some hairy pie and then they have sex.

333
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,178
Vaginal first. Romance is not dead.

334
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:47,457
Then, one up the bum,
no harm done, then more oral.

335
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:49,065
I don't make the rules. It happens.

336
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:51,416
Finally, bukkake. She's left embarrassed.

337
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,946
Egg on her face, so to speak.

338
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:57,102
- Yeah, well, I want to change all that.
- Two pounds, love. You'll enjoy that.

339
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,661
So you want him to come on her first?
How will that work?

340
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,937
You don't understand
the basics of pornography.

341
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:04,660
It's not based on the same criteria
as regular films.

342
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,743
If someone rents a normal movie,

343
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:09,745
watches it for ten minutes, switches it off,
it means it was shit.

344
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,745
With pornography, quite the reverse.
It means job done.

345
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:16,416
I want to make the first adult movie
where people want to watch to the end.

346
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:18,499
They'll tug themselves numb!

347
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:21,220
But, if you can do it, you'll have
changed the way people think

348
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,701
of gentlemen's special-interest cinema.

349
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:25,385
If anyone can do it, you can, mate.

350
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:29,976
One more thing, Baggy.

351
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:33,303
There's a saying in show business,
"Never work with children or animals."

352
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,939
Nowhere is that truer than porno.

353
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,265
"The sharpest sword cuts silk, not stone."

354
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,141
"The warrior must live like he's already dead."

355
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:52,825
Come.

356
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:57,226
Mr Perry,

357
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:00,899
I know you're a very busy man,
so I won't take up a second of your time.

358
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,903
- I've got Candy.
- Bollocks.

359
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,859
For The Love Storm.
You said if I could get Candy Fiveways.

360
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:08,056
Well, I've got her.

361
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:10,905
I spoke to her management.
Discussed terms. Agreed a deal.

362
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,505
Bollocks you have!

363
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:14,538
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

364
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,661
I've had the people at Bell End Pictures
on the phone.

365
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:19,698
Probably more their sort of thing, anyway.

366
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,616
Robby, get Mr Clarke a chair.

367
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:33,426
You've got Candy?

368
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:37,857
Her agents drove quite a hard bargain,
but, yeah, everyone's happy.

369
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,866
She's very excited. I'm very excited.

370
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:42,465
Well, well, well.

371
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:45,743
Doughnut?

372
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:16,139
Congratulations, Joe.
I'm a difficult man to impress.

373
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:18,977
I look forward to working with Miss Fiveways.

374
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:22,337
And I'm sure Miss Fiveways is looking
forward to working with you again.

375
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,821
- Robby!
- You've worked with her before?

376
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:29,540
Yeah. You're a producer. You know
it's all about keeping plates in the air.

377
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:33,661
We did experience a few minor difficulties
with her on our last production.

378
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:35,857
Cash flow. You know the sort of thing.

379
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:40,423
I bear no grudge, but I do think it would
be best if our involvement was limited

380
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,935
to our subsidiary film-developing arm.

381
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,335
Big Bang Pictures.

382
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:50,618
- Big Bang Pictures?
- Yeah, Big Bang Pictures.

383
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,458
Think of us as a silent partner.

384
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:55,384
"Silent" being the operative word.

385
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,498
No-one hears about this deal. Understand?

386
00:20:59,547 --> 00:21:01,299
What deal?

387
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:04,221
I do not understand. Why would...

388
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:08,383
Hi, guys. What's the haps?
Can we have a little chat?

389
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:11,260
We make a film, a political allegory.

390
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:16,904
The chicken, he represent
the suffering of the flightless masses

391
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:20,383
and the sky, she represent the hope.

392
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:23,499
- And the balloons?
- It's Gabi's birthday.

393
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:25,981
- Hi.
- So I hear you get money for The Love Storm.

394
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:28,257
You top-student, filmmaker guys.

395
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:31,060
And you, top sound, camera, lighting guys.

396
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:34,256
Listen, we're going to need a crew.

397
00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:37,697
Chicken!

398
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:40,181
- Brilliant. Are you in?
- No.

399
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:44,106
Sorry, no.
The cinema is like a window to the soul.

400
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:47,662
For us to make a commercial film
would be to ask big-time chef

401
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,026
to make chicken nuggets.

402
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,183
We make chicken in a basket.

403
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,660
Fair enough.

404
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:54,857
It's not your sort of thing, anyway.

405
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:57,296
There will be some girls in it and nudity.

406
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,016
Imagine shooting that first scene.

407
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:03,465
She's walking towards you.

408
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:06,658
Long hair cascades down,
staring right into your eyes.

409
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:10,782
Swinging hips,
fertile, with all of a woman's promise.

410
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:16,222
Then, she leans forward
and just whispers in your ear...

411
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,098
"It's time for your bed bath."

412
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,898
Her crisp, white nurse's uniform
can barely contain her...

413
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,660
heaving breasts.

414
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:27,618
She wants you.

415
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,781
She wants you.

416
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:36,503
- But we'll find someone else.
- No, no, we will do it.

417
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,062
- Your chicken's getting away.
- Hey!

418
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:06,782
OK, people.

419
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:08,625
Everyone ready? Everyone excited?

420
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,704
If a member of staff so much as
glances our way, what's the signal?

421
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:17,139
Right. Then we get rid of anything that doesn't
look like a Ukrainian art-house audition.

422
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:19,981
Like the girls with their boobies out?

423
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:24,016
For God's sake, Lila.
Grow up. We're making a film here.

424
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:28,185
I know Baggy is, but you're
awfully excited about this casting thing.

425
00:23:28,227 --> 00:23:30,536
I can't help thinking it's the boobies.

426
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:33,181
Hey, I'm realising a dream here.

427
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:36,663
I was staring at a life in the suburbs,
working for my dad,

428
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:40,382
with nothing to show for myself
except crippling mediocrity,

429
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:43,976
failed ambitions and the overwhelming desire
to have a bath with a toaster.

430
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:46,495
And now, now, we're all actually
making the movie

431
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:49,266
that is going to get us out of Leatherhead
and into the big time.

432
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:51,662
That is why I'm excited, Lila, OK?

433
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:54,345
That and the boobies.

434
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:57,463
You have never known what it is to be happy.

435
00:23:58,427 --> 00:23:59,621
But wait.

436
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:02,703
Uncle Vanya, wait!

437
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:05,617
We shall rest.

438
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,939
That's great, Lucy, really, really great.
We'll be in touch.

439
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,420
Sorry. Baggy, didn't you have something else
to ask Lucy?

440
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,219
What? No. No.

441
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,223
That's all for today. Thank you, Lucy.

442
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,781
Hang on. Sorry.
Don't you need to see her without...?

443
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,738
No. No.

444
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:25,778
- Yes. You definitely said...
- No, I didn't.

445
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:28,421
Definitely didn't. It's not the kind of thing I'd say.

446
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,779
- Joe, maybe you should.
- Where's my pen?

447
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:34,736
Thank you, Lucy. That's all we need.
We'll be in touch.

448
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:37,342
OK, so you don't want to see my tits, then?

449
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:40,696
- That won't be necessary.
- That would be great.

450
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,544
- Won't be necessary.
- We'd love to.

451
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:46,179
>> Shake what your mama gave ya,
left, right and back, back

452
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:49,344
>> Shake what your mama gave ya,
shake what your mama gave ya

453
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,459
>> Shake what your mama gave ya,
left, right and back, back

454
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:55,698
>> Shake what your mama gave ya,
shake what your mama gave ya

455
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:57,658
>> Shake what your mama gave ya

456
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:03,260
Atten-shun!

457
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:06,620
Left! Right!

458
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:09,259
Left! Right!

459
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,696
Left, right! Left, right!

460
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:14,466
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!

461
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:26,136
I think about what might have been,
but the Jezebel packed her bags...

462
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,664
and went away

463
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:33,505
and I've never been the same again
since that summer.

464
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,458
Thank you...

465
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:38,021
Carl, that was, that'll be all.

466
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:41,500
Excuse me.

467
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:44,619
Carl, that was a very brave performance.

468
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,305
I know.

469
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:48,258
I wrote it myself.

470
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:50,263
It's just about this really,

471
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:52,775
really emotional time in my life.

472
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:57,264
I like to draw on everything I can to make
my acting as deep and as real as it can be.

473
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,821
- Could we see you without your shirt on?
- Absolutely.

474
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:03,536
Thank you, Carl.

475
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:06,305
Very nice.

476
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:07,866
- Joe?
- Yeah. No.

477
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:09,659
Sorry, mate, you're not really...

478
00:26:09,707 --> 00:26:12,983
- We're looking for something different.
- Great. We'll be in touch.

479
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:14,695
Yeah?

480
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:17,021
- Great.
- Great.

481
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:21,221
Great.

482
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:22,503
Next!

483
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:37,619
>> Way down deep in the middle of the Congo

484
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,898
>> A hippo took an apricot,
a guava and a mango

485
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:44,781
>> He stuck 'em with the others
and danced a dainty tango

486
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:48,864
>> The rhino said,
"l know, we'll call it Um Bongo"

487
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,865
>> Um Bongo, Um Bongo,
they drink it in the Congo

488
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:53,306
>> Um Bongo, Um Bongo

489
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:55,258
>> They drink it in the Congo

490
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:59,097
That's great. We'll be in touch.

491
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:01,182
Did you like it?

492
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:03,900
Great choice. It's very powerful, very now.

493
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:05,660
I made a shield.

494
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:07,744
I love the shield.

495
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:15,622
Well, that was some of our best moves.

496
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,619
We've set the standard.

497
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:27,380
That's a very unusual audition piece, Mai Ling.

498
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:30,100
You can roll me around like a choo-choo train.

499
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:32,263
The Ping-Pong balls are the steam.

500
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:37,375
You want even better? I go get peach.

501
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,864
>> Shake what your mama gave ya,
left, right and back, back

502
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:48,263
>> Shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

503
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:07,777
All right, what the hell's going on
and who the hell are you?

504
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:10,146
Lila Owens.

505
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:11,666
It's a huge honour.

506
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:15,143
These two have told me so much about you.
You're a bit of a hero to them.

507
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:17,576
They admire your ability
to deconstruct modern cinema.

508
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:20,500
Really?

509
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:23,818
Well, "hero" is a big word.

510
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:25,779
I'm just a guy doing his job.

511
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:41,816
Good job, guys.

512
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:43,739
Continuez-vous.

513
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:50,497
>> Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake, shake

514
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:53,698
>> Shake, shake, shake,
shake what your mama gave ya

515
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:55,979
Why don't you roll back on in this way?

516
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,461
She's fine, son.
Leave her be, yeah? Leave her be.

517
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:03,782
OK, good. Then this is our cast.

518
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:06,537
- What about Candy?
- You said she'd be here.

519
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:09,659
I have to sort out costumes.
We haven't even got a location yet.

520
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:12,660
Come on. She said she will be here.
She will be here.

521
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,538
Package for Joe Clarke.

522
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,097
Yeah, over here. Lila, let me tell you something.

523
00:29:19,147 --> 00:29:21,138
Not only have I negotiated a fantastic deal

524
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:24,577
with her representative
at Fiveways lnternational,

525
00:29:24,627 --> 00:29:29,576
but he also assured me
that she would be here any time now.

526
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:34,462
So, how's about you trot along
and production manage a place for her to relax,

527
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,419
while I prepare myself for the imminent arrival

528
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:40,027
of one of the most beautiful women
in the world?

529
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:41,895
Yeah?

530
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:53,703
I think she's just arrived.

531
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:57,656
No.

532
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:02,818
Wow. I'm in shock.

533
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,983
She looks taller on film, don't you think?

534
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:07,018
You're in shock? Look at her.

535
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:09,858
Joe! Do you think this is funny?

536
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,545
No. No.

537
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:13,782
I don't. I'm just saying that...

538
00:30:13,827 --> 00:30:17,342
Look, hey, I'm a producer, yeah?
So, I'm going to step up and produce.

539
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:20,026
There's always problems on a movie shoot.
Everything'll be fine.

540
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:24,146
We saw loads of people today
who will be just as good as Candy Fiveways.

541
00:30:24,187 --> 00:30:27,224
Come on, yeah? Let's cheer up, shall we?

542
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,576
You, with your little down face. Come on!

543
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:32,421
Hello. What's this?

544
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,537
It's Miss Candy Fiveways. Hello.

545
00:30:34,587 --> 00:30:38,262
Look at your pretty chops.
Hello! Mr Bagley.

546
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:40,218
Look at her.

547
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:41,620
Hello.

548
00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:45,337
Miss Owens. Oh, my God,
I'm hot for some lezza action right now.

549
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:47,700
It's OK.

550
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:51,220
Joe! Stop it!

551
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,586
Joe, stop!

552
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,699
- Seriously, Joe...
- Yeah?

553
00:30:57,747 --> 00:31:00,466
Our investors are expecting
a Candy Fiveways film

554
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:03,579
- and you've provided them with a blow-up doll.
- Lila.

555
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:05,777
Sweetheart, it's going to be fine.

556
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:07,465
We've got a great cast.

557
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:09,259
Just leave the money to me, OK?

558
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:13,296
Many people think the butterfly suffers,

559
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:16,225
but the chloroform dulls its senses
and it feels nothing.

560
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:20,260
This way, it won't struggle
when the pin punctures its body.

561
00:31:21,387 --> 00:31:23,264
So, how's my film?

562
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:26,856
The film? It's great. Yeah. Fully prepped.

563
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:31,415
Friends become enemies and
enemies have sex with each other.

564
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:33,266
And our star?

565
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:36,026
Candy? She's great.
She can't wait to get started.

566
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:38,180
I find that very surprising.

567
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:41,856
That's all water under the bridge.
We're thick as thieves, these days.

568
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,625
That's wonderful news.

569
00:31:44,307 --> 00:31:45,581
I find it surprising, Doug,

570
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:49,506
because she's taking a break from films
to promote some book she's written.

571
00:31:49,547 --> 00:31:53,779
She fancies herself as an author. She's in town
doing book signings at this moment.

572
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:55,898
You should probably give her a call, Doug.

573
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:59,424
No, there's no need, Mr De Vere.
I've been on the phone to her all week.

574
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,423
She's very excited.

575
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,697
We're very excited. Aren't we?

576
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:06,940
That's very good, because I paid you
for a Candy Fiveways film

577
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:08,466
and I expect you to deliver.

578
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,459
Yeah, this is the place.

579
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:17,339
Don't look much of a film company.

580
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,142
- Are you Mr Dulberg?
- Guilty as charged.

581
00:32:29,187 --> 00:32:32,418
I'm looking for Joe Clarke.
The lady at the desk said to talk to you.

582
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,503
Right. Yeah, Joe's one of my students.

583
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:37,900
Not in at the moment. Probably gone home.
Sorry, you are?

584
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:39,426
I'm his dad. This is his brother.

585
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:43,419
Right, well, great kid.
A lot of fun. Well done, you.

586
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:47,817
We were hanging out in the rehearsal
room earlier, having a right laugh.

587
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,858
Always got something to say.
Can't shut him up.

588
00:32:49,907 --> 00:32:53,217
Well, I'll see if I can shut him up for you.
What's his address again?

589
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,016
I thought Joe lived at home with you
and Mrs Clarke.

590
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,098
Yeah, of course he does. Where's that?

591
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,982
- What?
- What?

592
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:03,301
You don't know where you live?

593
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:06,180
We both know I know where I live,
but do you know where I live?

594
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:10,226
Well, I can't just give out students' addresses.

595
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:14,466
We have the old student-teacher
bond of trust, yawn, but...

596
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:18,136
But it's not his address, is it? It's my address.
Surely you can give me my address?

597
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:25,539
8, Chester Crescent.

598
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:27,821
Hello. Can I help you?

599
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:30,540
Mr Clarke?
I'm Mr Dulberg, Joe's teacher from college.

600
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:35,266
Right. Well, it's a bit late, Mr Dulberg.
No trouble with Joe, I trust?

601
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:38,305
- Joe? No, no, good as gold.
- You've just missed him.

602
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:40,736
He won't be back for a while.
I'll tell him you called.

603
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:43,301
No, don't put yourself out on my account. I'll wait.

604
00:33:55,107 --> 00:33:57,063
There he is!

605
00:33:57,107 --> 00:34:00,656
I was telling Valerie and Stephen
what a Jack-the-lad you were at college.

606
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,902
Mr Dulberg here has been waiting
for over an hour.

607
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,259
Mr Dulberg?

608
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:11,858
Yes. He very kindly dropped by to...
What exactly did you drop by for?

609
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:14,660
I would very much like to talk it out with you,
one to one.

610
00:34:15,547 --> 00:34:18,778
Show Valerie and Stephen into
the dining room, would you, Robby?

611
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:21,022
- You want us in the dining room?
- Please.

612
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:22,978
Got any Wagon Wheels?

613
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:25,976
Nice suit.

614
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:30,864
Mr Perry, whatever deal we have is between us,
so leave my parents out of it.

615
00:34:30,907 --> 00:34:33,944
Joe, as the executive partner of our film,

616
00:34:33,987 --> 00:34:37,377
I've dropped round to double-check
a couple of things before we start rolling.

617
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:41,579
Chiefly, whether you do, indeed, have Candy,
as you say.

618
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,823
- Any particular reason?
- We've got a little issue with our investor.

619
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,459
He's not as easy-going as I am.

620
00:34:47,507 --> 00:34:50,305
He's what we, in the trade, call "an evil bastard".

621
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:54,465
If he thought you'd been spending
his ill-gotten gains on flash suits and hair gel,

622
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:57,340
Iet's just say he'll find you and your friend...

623
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,945
Baggy, is it?

624
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,501
Well, that's...

625
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:03,380
That's lucky, then, because we've got her.

626
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:05,666
Yep.

627
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:08,540
Rest assured, she is signed,
sealed and delivered.

628
00:35:08,587 --> 00:35:10,623
How long have you been working
at the college?

629
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,895
I don't work at the college.

630
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:14,507
We thought you were an associate
of Mr Dulberg's.

631
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,663
I only just met him. I don't know Mr Dulberg.

632
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:20,855
- Why are you here, then?
- I don't know.

633
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:24,106
- Ask Doug.
- Who's Doug?

634
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,178
I don't know!

635
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:30,341
More 'Bena?

636
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:34,617
I spoke to her this morning, actually,
and she's really looking forward to it.

637
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,862
Jets in tomorrow from LA.

638
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:40,616
No more bullshit!
She's in London, promoting her poncy book.

639
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:42,783
Now, you promised me a Candy Fiveways film.

640
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:47,025
I've promised our investor a Candy Fiveways
film. And that's what we're going to get.

641
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:50,503
- Or?
- Or l'l kill you.

642
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:54,064
Can I come in now?

643
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:58,937
You little monkey.
What am I going to do with you?

644
00:35:58,987 --> 00:36:02,616
Now, look, Mr Dulberg, we'd like to
know what the blue blazes is going on.

645
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,658
Keep your knickers on. Our job is done here.

646
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:07,744
Valerie, now, you've got a great kid here,
good as gold.

647
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:10,506
Always brings me an apple,
stays late to wipe the blackboard

648
00:36:10,547 --> 00:36:12,060
and doesn't fuck about too much.

649
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:15,305
I'm covering the visual event, Mr Dulberg.
I'm on it.

650
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:20,099
Don't worry. We'll see ourselves out.

651
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:26,698
Bye, Robby.

652
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:34,095
He's a bit eccentric,
but he's a bloody good teacher.

653
00:36:45,627 --> 00:36:49,256
How are we going to recognise her? Think she
looks like the doll? Shall we stick a pin in her?

654
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:52,617
Stop being so negative, Bags.
She'll be the one signing the books.

655
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:57,058
We'll approach her directly this time,
skip the agent. Trust me, I'm a producer.

656
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:00,060
She's the one signing the books.

657
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:04,181
OK, there are minders either side of her...

658
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,026
>> Yes!

659
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,016
Bags?

660
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:23,899
- Come back...
- Well, this is lovely. Thanks for inviting me.

661
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:28,380
- You do know how to charm a lady.
- Lila, I need your help.

662
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:31,906
I'm in a shitload of trouble.

663
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:34,779
- Hi. What's your name?
- Sam.

664
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:37,100
Sam?

665
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:40,386
- Did you enjoy the film?
- Yeah.

666
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:43,703
I've probably watched it about
a hundred, a hundred and fifty times.

667
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:45,499
I've nearly worn out the disc.

668
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:46,941
Well...

669
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:49,057
Play it again, Sam.

670
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:52,099
OK, I will.

671
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:55,262
Could you make it out to my wife?
Her name's Dave.

672
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,979
That was a misquote from Casablanca.
I don't know if I can look at you.

673
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,825
- Yes, I can.
- My, a punter with a brain.

674
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:05,984
- "It's my second favourite organ."
- Woody Allen's Sleeper.

675
00:38:06,027 --> 00:38:07,858
I knew it was a misquote, by the way.

676
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:11,105
- Yeah. Sure. Of course you did.
- I did!

677
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:13,945
Well, as Oscar Wilde once said, "Whatever."

678
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:17,263
I can't believe you've got us making
a porno for a bunch of gangsters.

679
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:19,696
This is unbelievable, even by your standards.

680
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:21,705
What are you going to tell Baggy?

681
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:25,626
You can't tell him, Lila. You know what he's like.
He'll freak out. He'll crumble.

682
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,385
He's a stammering wreck at the best of times.

683
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:30,100
You're out of your mind, Fiveways.
It must be the heat.

684
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:35,062
And you call yourself a film buff?
You're clearly insane. I should call security.

685
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:38,497
I'm sorry. Mission To Moscow was
never as good as Citizens On Patrol.

686
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:40,503
Miss Fiveways, the queue.

687
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:42,220
Sorry. Duty calls.

688
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:45,146
You want me to sign this?

689
00:38:45,187 --> 00:38:48,145
I want you to read it. I wrote it for you.

690
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:52,786
Well, I'm on sabbatical.

691
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:55,057
No porn films till next year. Publisher's orders.

692
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,904
Don't think of it as a porn film.

693
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:59,541
Think of it as a film
with scenes of an adult nature.

694
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:04,185
- Please, just read it, yeah?
- OK.

695
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:06,381
Cheers.

696
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:10,222
Hello. I came here from Dusseldorf to see you.

697
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:16,376
Please write as follows.
"To Rudi. Last night was unglaublich.

698
00:39:16,427 --> 00:39:18,816
You have the greatest balls in Germany."

699
00:39:19,387 --> 00:39:20,706
OK.

700
00:39:20,787 --> 00:39:24,700
Yes, I know. OK, I'm an idiot,
but I don't want to die.

701
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:29,980
Just give them their money back. Forget the
whole thing. You've still got the money, right?

702
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:32,177
- Right?
- What?

703
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,464
You don't have the money, do you?

704
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:36,384
The suit, the watch, the mobile.

705
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,544
The blow-up doll I thought was an actress.

706
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:41,021
- You're not taking this seriously.
- I am. I promise.

707
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:44,345
- That's for lying to us.
- I'm sorry and I was wrong. Again.

708
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:47,663
- For letting down your best friend.
- Deserves more than that. One more.

709
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:49,335
- One more.
- No.

710
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,582
- You're enjoying it, you pervert!
- I am, yeah.

711
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:53,538
- Dirty...
- Hi, guys. What's happening?

712
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:55,896
- Hi, Baggy. We were just chatting.
- Chatting.

713
00:39:57,387 --> 00:40:00,185
Yeah, I spoke to Candy. I gave her the script.

714
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:01,706
You? Really?

715
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,624
She's reading it. She's going to call us.

716
00:40:08,827 --> 00:40:10,783
That's it. She's not going to call.

717
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:13,057
She hates the script. We might as well give up.

718
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:15,985
Well, on the plus side,
I've found us a new location.

719
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:19,178
That's brilliant, Liles.
Great. What shall we use it for?

720
00:40:19,227 --> 00:40:22,822
A massive party? A bring-and-buy sale?
A charity sales-a-thon?

721
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:32,940
Hello. Hi.

722
00:40:35,947 --> 00:40:38,381
Yeah. They're, they're called...

723
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:42,059
- Big Bang Pictures.
- Big Bang Pictures of Soho.

724
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:45,784
A high-end, professional production outfit.
OK. OK.

725
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:48,295
Yeah, that sounds, that sounds reasonable.

726
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:49,336
OK.

727
00:40:49,827 --> 00:40:51,226
Bye. Bye-bye.

728
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,180
What happened?

729
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:55,058
A busy day as a top director is what happened.

730
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:57,223
- What did she say?
- She read it.

731
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:59,383
She likes it. She'll meet us tomorrow.

732
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:05,300
Take the library books back before nine
or there's a surcharge.

733
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:06,905
Don't forget Joe's trousers.

734
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:10,257
Jeepers Creepers! It's 7:34.
Time to slip into gear, Valerie.

735
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:13,343
Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

736
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:16,740
- Come on, love.
- Have a good day at college, darling.

737
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:22,383
Have a great day.

738
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:32,656
Morning, Liles.
We can't be late. Where are we going?

739
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,943
Yes. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.

740
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:37,896
Morning, Bagster. You all right?

741
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:39,505
All set for the big day?

742
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:40,781
Cristi.

743
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:42,738
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

744
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:45,017
Liles, focus. Location.
Where are we going to go?

745
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:46,580
Just try and keep an open mind.

746
00:41:50,347 --> 00:41:51,746
Hello, Joe.

747
00:41:52,107 --> 00:41:54,063
- It's here, innit?
- Hiya.

748
00:41:54,107 --> 00:41:55,540
No. No way. I'm not...

749
00:41:55,587 --> 00:41:59,785
No sets to build, no location fees.
You can set your watch by your parents' routine.

750
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:01,101
They'll have no idea.

751
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:05,620
I'm going to kill you.

752
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,255
Joe, I need to talk to you. In private.

753
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:40,059
- Can we go upstairs, please?
- Hold on.

754
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:42,496
This could be the moment
we've been waiting for.

755
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:51,746
I didn't sleep last night.
Can we discuss this? This is important.

756
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:54,218
Fasten your seat belts, Bagster.

757
00:42:56,027 --> 00:42:57,585
The Fiveways has landed.

758
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:00,265
Oh, my God.

759
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,975
>> Yes

760
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:07,743
>> Yeah

761
00:43:32,747 --> 00:43:35,102
- Hi.
- Miss Fiveways, Joe Clarke, producer.

762
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:36,626
Hi, Joe. Nice to meet you.

763
00:43:36,707 --> 00:43:38,425
Welcome.

764
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:41,458
- Should we go in?
- Go inside?

765
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:43,346
Thank you.

766
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:48,625
Morning, Mr Rogers. Lovely day for it.

767
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:56,376
So...

768
00:43:56,427 --> 00:43:58,622
this is Sound Stage 1.

769
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:00,419
It's compact, but it's efficient.

770
00:44:01,747 --> 00:44:04,420
Make-up's on the mezzanine level.

771
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,856
- And these are two of our talented cast.
- Hi.

772
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:09,785
- And catering's towards the rear.
- Hi.

773
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:13,536
- Let me show you to the beverage counter.
- Baggy? Baggy, are you OK?

774
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:16,420
No, I'm not. This whole thing's not going to work.

775
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,901
The character motivation is not fully developed.

776
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,576
The second act through-line is weak.
The subplots are underwritten.

777
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:26,176
- Just calm down.
- I want this to stop. It's stopped. I've stopped it.

778
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:27,455
- Come on.
- The script...

779
00:44:27,507 --> 00:44:32,023
May I introduce you to three of the hottest
creative technicians in the business?

780
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:35,543
This is Gabi, our sound recordist.
He's big news in Poland.

781
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:40,860
This is Cristi, cinematographer.
He's award-winning, multi-talented.

782
00:44:41,147 --> 00:44:43,661
And this is Vlad, our lighting technician.

783
00:44:44,587 --> 00:44:47,385
- Sorry.
- Where's John?

784
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:48,826
Baggy?

785
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:50,425
He must be fine-tuning the script.

786
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:56,663
Come on, Baggy, just relax.

787
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:59,460
Sex is the most natural thing in the world.

788
00:44:59,507 --> 00:45:01,225
I'm trying, Lila. I just can't.

789
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:03,735
- It's not hard, Baggy.
- I know. I know.

790
00:45:04,507 --> 00:45:07,101
Baggy, it isn't hard and I know you can do it.

791
00:45:07,147 --> 00:45:09,615
I just feel so inadequate.

792
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,181
- It's not hard.
- I know. I know. I'm sorry.

793
00:45:12,227 --> 00:45:13,421
Back in a sec.

794
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:15,697
- Baggy, come on.
- I'm all out of juice.

795
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:18,136
You just need to take yourself in hand.

796
00:45:22,147 --> 00:45:23,500
..say this is the way in...

797
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:30,500
Baggs, you have got to snap out of it.

798
00:45:31,627 --> 00:45:34,858
How long have we wanted this?
There is an actress downstairs,

799
00:45:34,907 --> 00:45:37,660
who'll think we're the biggest bunch
of amateurs ever.

800
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:40,619
She's going to walk any second
unless we do something.

801
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,385
- Is there anything wrong?
- Candy.

802
00:45:43,027 --> 00:45:45,336
Hello. No. Just having a...

803
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:48,140
- It's a budget meeting.
- Listen, we need to talk.

804
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:52,865
I can see you've put a lot
into setting up this film.

805
00:45:53,987 --> 00:45:57,662
I mean, it's pretty impressive
for a bunch of film students

806
00:45:58,707 --> 00:46:02,256
working on a shoestring budget
with little or no experience.

807
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:06,540
And it can't be easy shooting
in your parents' house while they're at work.

808
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:11,703
But I'm here because
this is a great script that deserves to be made.

809
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:17,387
So, I'd like for you all to leave now,
so that I can speak with my director.

810
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:20,420
- That's first-night nerves. He'll be fine.
- Alone.

811
00:46:21,107 --> 00:46:23,098
We'll be outside.

812
00:46:32,747 --> 00:46:36,262
I'm sorry. I'm a failure.
"l give failures a bad name."

813
00:46:36,987 --> 00:46:40,024
It's time you stopped quoting
other people's films, John.

814
00:46:40,067 --> 00:46:42,422
And start quoting from The Love Storm.

815
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,025
John, this is your big chance.

816
00:46:44,547 --> 00:46:46,378
You don't understand.

817
00:46:47,867 --> 00:46:51,940
You think Fellini never doubted himself?
You think Spielberg was never scared?

818
00:46:52,427 --> 00:46:55,658
We were all first-timers once, Baggy,
Fellini, Spielberg...

819
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:59,140
- Micklewhite.
- Yeah.

820
00:46:59,187 --> 00:47:01,906
- Who?
- Alice Micklewhite.

821
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:05,144
Bottom-of-the-class Alice,
pigtails-and-freckles Alice.

822
00:47:06,307 --> 00:47:07,057
Me.

823
00:47:08,907 --> 00:47:10,943
So where did "Candy Fiveways" come from?

824
00:47:12,147 --> 00:47:15,537
Haven't you ever played the
"what's your porn-star name" game?

825
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:19,422
You take the name of your first pet
and the street you grew up on.

826
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:22,298
Candy was this horrible cat,

827
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:24,019
but I loved her.

828
00:47:25,147 --> 00:47:28,583
And I grew up on the corner
of this busy intersection, Fiveways.

829
00:47:28,627 --> 00:47:31,505
- "Candy Fiveways."
- So it is just a made-up name?

830
00:47:31,547 --> 00:47:34,857
There aren't really five ways?

831
00:47:37,747 --> 00:47:39,738
I've got so much to teach you.

832
00:47:44,187 --> 00:47:45,745
>> Hello there, everybody

833
00:47:45,987 --> 00:47:48,660
The Love Storm.
Slate one. Scene one. Take one.

834
00:47:49,987 --> 00:47:52,057
- Camera set.
- Action.

835
00:47:52,107 --> 00:47:53,984
>> Action
>> Come on

836
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:55,455
>> Action

837
00:47:55,507 --> 00:47:58,067
>> Action
>> I want to see all the birds on the floor

838
00:47:58,107 --> 00:48:00,575
>> I want some action in the morning

839
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,857
Even the way she walks is sexy.

840
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,185
>> I want some action with you

841
00:48:06,227 --> 00:48:08,661
Hello. Can I help you?

842
00:48:09,627 --> 00:48:11,663
I need someone to please undo these...

843
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,899
Cut!

844
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:17,181
Can we do that again
without the old guy, please?

845
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,580
Take two.

846
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:22,904
- OK. Camera set.
- Action.

847
00:48:28,707 --> 00:48:30,902
What do you think she did to Baggy up there?

848
00:48:30,947 --> 00:48:33,939
By the looks of him,
I'd say she did all five ways.

849
00:48:34,907 --> 00:48:36,659
All five?

850
00:48:38,187 --> 00:48:40,178
"Hello. Can I help you? "

851
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:42,138
I need someone to please help me.

852
00:48:44,107 --> 00:48:47,224
- But l, but I've never met...
- Cut!

853
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:49,298
Lila, go and talk to our friend, please?

854
00:48:52,627 --> 00:48:55,095
Sorry, we're just trying to make a film over there.

855
00:48:55,427 --> 00:48:56,780
Would you mind...?

856
00:48:57,387 --> 00:48:59,059
Action.

857
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,026
Hello.

858
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,945
- Can I help you?
- I need someone to please undo these.

859
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,979
But this is the first time
I've met you in my entire life.

860
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,744
But I need you.

861
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:17,499
In that case, you'd better come inside.

862
00:49:21,387 --> 00:49:22,502
Cut! Fantastic.

863
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:27,179
Thank you, sir. How much are these?

864
00:49:37,907 --> 00:49:39,818
>> Bow-wow wow-wow

865
00:49:40,947 --> 00:49:42,619
>> If you treat me like a dog

866
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:46,580
>> Then I'll just get down on all fours
and bark and howl all night

867
00:49:49,107 --> 00:49:53,623
>> I don't need no behavioural psychologist

868
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:58,978
>> If you treat me like a dog

869
00:49:59,027 --> 00:50:03,020
>> Then I'll just get down on all fours
and bark and howl all night

870
00:50:05,347 --> 00:50:09,579
>> Talking Rin Tin Tin or Lassie with a twist

871
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:21,265
Apparently, it was some kind of localised
power surge. The college wasn't affected.

872
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:24,140
It'll be Mr Harper at No.1 2
with his industrial strimmer.

873
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,939
I know. I know. He's so selfish.

874
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:28,420
Damn you, Mr Harper!

875
00:50:30,507 --> 00:50:32,099
>> Hello, there, everybody

876
00:50:32,187 --> 00:50:34,064
>> Action
>> Party, party

877
00:50:34,107 --> 00:50:35,142
>> Come on, love

878
00:50:35,187 --> 00:50:36,620
>> Yeah
>> Action

879
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,544
>> Swing them luggies, all right?

880
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:40,305
>> Action
>> Come on

881
00:50:40,347 --> 00:50:41,575
>> Action

882
00:50:41,627 --> 00:50:44,221
>> Action
>> I want to see all the birds on the floor

883
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:46,576
>> I want some action in the morning

884
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:49,384
That's mine!

885
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:52,535
Miss Fiveways, sorry, can I have a quick word?

886
00:50:53,827 --> 00:50:57,342
All things considered, I think you know
me well enough to call me Candy.

887
00:50:58,187 --> 00:51:00,223
Candy.

888
00:51:00,267 --> 00:51:01,416
I just wanted to...

889
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:04,265
I just wanted to thank you
for "helping" Baggy the other day.

890
00:51:05,227 --> 00:51:07,138
- It's my pleasure.
- Was it?

891
00:51:08,227 --> 00:51:09,421
Was it?

892
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:10,900
Because...

893
00:51:11,587 --> 00:51:15,466
you know, we all need
a little bit of help, once in a while.

894
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:23,938
Thank God!

895
00:51:24,267 --> 00:51:27,020
You don't know how long
I've waited to hear you say that.

896
00:51:27,907 --> 00:51:29,579
Really?

897
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:33,305
I really want you.

898
00:51:34,987 --> 00:51:36,181
This is...

899
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:37,786
That is amazing!

900
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,184
Go on, go on, teach me.

901
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:42,263
Yeah, show me the fifth way.

902
00:51:49,947 --> 00:51:51,096
OK.

903
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:56,340
So, Baggy, what am I supposed
to be feeling in this scene?

904
00:51:56,387 --> 00:51:59,345
When you come in, you should be like,
"Whoa, what's going on? "

905
00:51:59,387 --> 00:52:01,947
But don't say it.
Do it with your eyes, like, "Whoa."

906
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,466
Joe?

907
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,146
What are you doing?

908
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:11,263
- Candy. I'm waiting for Candy.
- What?

909
00:52:13,747 --> 00:52:15,738
She's going to show me the fifth way.

910
00:52:15,787 --> 00:52:17,015
- Really?
- Yeah.

911
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:20,305
She said I needed to be fully lubed up.

912
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:23,339
I couldn't find any baby oil,
so I used a little bit of butter

913
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:25,662
and she said that's even better, so...

914
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:27,904
- Wow! You're a natural.
- Yeah.

915
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:32,899
It's actually going to happen, Liles.
A film-star woman!

916
00:52:32,947 --> 00:52:34,062
Jessica Rabbit.

917
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:37,497
Jessica Rabbit went home 20 minutes ago.
She's done for the day.

918
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:39,783
Pardon?

919
00:52:40,067 --> 00:52:42,706
Yeah. I think she's messing with you.

920
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:45,420
No. No. Cos...

921
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,458
She meant it. I could tell. She was really...

922
00:52:47,507 --> 00:52:49,418
I don't know, she was sexy.

923
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:51,260
She meant it.

924
00:52:51,307 --> 00:52:53,059
Well,

925
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:57,146
seeing as we're alone
and you're all greased up,

926
00:52:58,107 --> 00:52:59,984
it seems a shame to let you go to waste.

927
00:53:01,627 --> 00:53:03,140
I want you.

928
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:05,820
God, Joe, I want you.

929
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:08,182
Really?

930
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:12,581
No. Just messing with you.

931
00:53:24,107 --> 00:53:27,224
No, I've mentioned hoover bags,

932
00:53:27,547 --> 00:53:30,061
Yes. We need some more cleaning
tablets for the dishwasher.

933
00:53:31,387 --> 00:53:33,457
I'm sure we had a full tub of this yesterday.

934
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:35,022
Dad!

935
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:36,496
It's...

936
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,015
It's 7:34. Shouldn't you be slipping into gear?

937
00:53:39,707 --> 00:53:41,857
"Mirror, signal, manoeuvre."

938
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:46,463
Someone wants us out of the way
so they can get on with their special film.

939
00:53:48,347 --> 00:53:51,464
Yes. Your mother and I are very
excited about it. We can't wait to see it.

940
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:53,579
You want to see it?

941
00:53:53,627 --> 00:53:57,097
Well, of course we want to see it.
It's your two-minute masterpiece, innit?

942
00:53:58,587 --> 00:54:02,136
We can't wait to see what you've come up with
for your college film.

943
00:54:03,027 --> 00:54:04,346
Shooting it today.

944
00:54:07,547 --> 00:54:11,745
OK, guys, this is going to be the
two-minute film short for Mr Dulberg.

945
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:13,778
Take one.

946
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:20,978
- Cut.
- Sorry. Sorry.

947
00:54:22,307 --> 00:54:24,696
- Yeah. Hello.
- One more week, then you deliver.

948
00:54:25,667 --> 00:54:28,306
OK, Mum. That's, that's not a problem.

949
00:54:28,987 --> 00:54:34,778
Well, if you don't, I'm going to find you
and then, if I find you, I'm going to kill you.

950
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:38,220
That sounds great.

951
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:42,742
- Looking forward to it. Can't wait.
- Yeah. I bet you can't.

952
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:46,661
Baby. Sweetness.

953
00:54:47,987 --> 00:54:49,898
- See you soon.
- OK.

954
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:51,946
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

955
00:54:53,267 --> 00:54:55,337
Love you.

956
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:57,696
Yeah, I love you, too. All right.

957
00:54:57,747 --> 00:54:58,816
Bye. Bye.

958
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:06,859
- Everything all right?
- It's fine. It's all fine.

959
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:08,226
She's a super lady.

960
00:55:08,947 --> 00:55:10,505
- Turn it off.
- OK.

961
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:12,544
Again.

962
00:55:15,547 --> 00:55:16,866
Candy, are you happy?

963
00:55:16,907 --> 00:55:18,659
Happy.

964
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:20,459
Carl, are you ready?

965
00:55:20,507 --> 00:55:22,225
I was born ready.

966
00:55:27,627 --> 00:55:28,742
Wow.

967
00:55:31,827 --> 00:55:34,341
- Scene...
- Wait! Wait. Wait.

968
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:44,704
Scene 23. Take one.

969
00:55:46,827 --> 00:55:49,216
And action.

970
00:55:50,507 --> 00:55:52,543
My wife thinks I should ask you to stay.

971
00:55:53,427 --> 00:55:56,419
- Are you going to?
- I haven't decided yet.

972
00:55:58,907 --> 00:56:02,263
- What do you think?
- Depends.

973
00:56:02,307 --> 00:56:03,899
How good are you with rejection?

974
00:56:22,987 --> 00:56:25,581
Lila, could we have some Wet Wipes
over here, please?

975
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:27,902
Take two.

976
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,305
Just a couple more minutes.

977
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:31,697
Maybe.

978
00:56:33,507 --> 00:56:34,735
Take six.

979
00:56:35,227 --> 00:56:37,821
Come on, Carlito. Wake up, little man.

980
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:39,261
Up. Rise.

981
00:56:41,227 --> 00:56:42,342
Take seven.

982
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:51,822
Maybe this'll help.

983
00:56:55,987 --> 00:56:58,547
I don't even remember seeing that
on the props list.

984
00:56:58,587 --> 00:57:00,498
Joe, that's not one of our props.

985
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:02,458
She just got that out of the drawer.

986
00:57:02,507 --> 00:57:04,020
What?

987
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:06,820
Well, why would there be a vibrator
in my parents'...?

988
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:08,778
God, no! No, no, no, no!

989
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:10,419
Cut! Cut! Cut!

990
00:57:10,467 --> 00:57:12,025
That is disgusting!

991
00:57:16,587 --> 00:57:18,498
Hey, morning, Joe!

992
00:57:21,867 --> 00:57:24,461
>> I know a girl who's tough but sweet

993
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:28,906
>> She's so fine, she can't be beat

994
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,507
>> Got everything that I desire

995
00:57:35,467 --> 00:57:38,345
>> Sets the summer sun on fire

996
00:57:40,107 --> 00:57:42,177
>> I want Candy

997
00:57:44,707 --> 00:57:46,743
>> I want Candy

998
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:00,700
It's delicious.

999
00:58:00,747 --> 00:58:03,261
>> Oughta see her with her hair hung down

1000
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:07,661
>> Ain't no finer girl in town

1001
00:58:09,707 --> 00:58:12,267
>> Candy's just what the doctor ordered

1002
00:58:14,187 --> 00:58:17,065
>> She's so sweet, she makes my mouth water

1003
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:21,062
>> I want Candy

1004
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:24,376
>> I want...

1005
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:30,498
- Are you sure it's all right?
- Three cancellations in one day, Val?

1006
00:58:30,547 --> 00:58:34,620
I think somebody up there is ordering us
to take a little much-needed R&R.

1007
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:37,821
Stephen. You're a bad boy.

1008
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,180
1 04. Take three.

1009
00:58:45,947 --> 00:58:48,336
And action.

1010
00:58:48,947 --> 00:58:52,098
- Do you love him?
- How am I meant to know?

1011
00:58:52,147 --> 00:58:54,138
You feel his breath on your neck,

1012
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:58,822
and your skin reaches for his touch.

1013
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,545
He brushes your arm

1014
00:59:02,627 --> 00:59:05,300
and his fingerprint tingles for a minute.

1015
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:10,856
You can't close your eyes without seeing him.

1016
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:14,821
But you wouldn't change a thing,

1017
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:17,620
because everything's brighter
than it was a week ago.

1018
00:59:31,147 --> 00:59:34,059
Shit. Everybody, back door!

1019
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:36,021
I didn't agree to that.

1020
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:40,023
Don't cut. And, Candy, pick up that line from...
"and you churn".

1021
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:43,298
No! No! My parents are here.
Everyone, we have to go now.

1022
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:44,905
- Now!
- Ten seconds. Go.

1023
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:58,499
While we've got the house to ourselves, why
don't you give me some special driving lessons?

1024
00:59:58,547 --> 01:00:00,936
You do need some help
with your parallel parking.

1025
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:10,946
Here, hold this.

1026
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:12,746
It tickles.

1027
01:00:14,387 --> 01:00:17,538
Afternoon, Mr Rogers. Nice day for it.

1028
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:22,655
..everything's brighter than it was a week ago.

1029
01:00:25,147 --> 01:00:27,502
- We've got it. Cut.
- Go! Go! Go, go! Go, go, go!

1030
01:00:27,547 --> 01:00:29,060
We're going!

1031
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:44,217
- Get out! Get out!
- Run! Run!

1032
01:00:59,987 --> 01:01:04,139
- You're coming with me, Mrs Clarke.
- Meow, Mr Clarke!

1033
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:09,456
We need a little music.

1034
01:01:09,507 --> 01:01:10,496
There.

1035
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:18,457
I think if I just undo this little thing here,

1036
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:20,623
and take this down here.

1037
01:01:26,387 --> 01:01:29,379
Hello, Joe. Why have your parents...?

1038
01:01:41,387 --> 01:01:42,376
Stephen.

1039
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:48,703
Your whole family want to be in the porn star.

1040
01:01:50,147 --> 01:01:51,466
Doctor...

1041
01:01:53,267 --> 01:01:55,178
- Doctor!
- Doctor?

1042
01:01:57,067 --> 01:02:00,377
- I'm going to lick you like a stamp.
- That's right.

1043
01:02:00,907 --> 01:02:04,502
- Give me your shirt.
- I'm going to flip you over like a pancake.

1044
01:02:05,107 --> 01:02:07,063
Trousers, too. Trousers!

1045
01:02:07,107 --> 01:02:08,699
We need to make a rope.

1046
01:02:10,947 --> 01:02:13,415
Now, how about if l...

1047
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,386
Come on, help me.

1048
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:20,497
- No.
- Not even if I do this?

1049
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,262
Who's your driving instructor?

1050
01:02:25,227 --> 01:02:29,015
- Who's your driving instructor?
- Hold that end. Hold it tight, OK?

1051
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:31,137
You, Daddy! You!

1052
01:02:42,827 --> 01:02:44,943
Your mum is a dirty vixen!

1053
01:02:58,267 --> 01:03:01,623
It's no good. I can't wait any longer. I'm bursting.

1054
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:04,135
Hold it in. Do the breathing.

1055
01:03:06,467 --> 01:03:08,105
No, is no good. Is coming.

1056
01:03:08,147 --> 01:03:10,183
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1057
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:39,939
Thank God.

1058
01:03:43,627 --> 01:03:44,821
Whoops.

1059
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:50,820
Mum. We didn't hear you come home.

1060
01:03:54,547 --> 01:03:55,821
This is Vlad.

1061
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:57,300
Plumber.

1062
01:03:57,347 --> 01:03:59,463
Just popped in to fix the toilet.

1063
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:03,105
I didn't know it was broken.

1064
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:06,419
It's not any more. He's a very good plumber.

1065
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,019
- Do you want me to show you out?
- Yes.

1066
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:13,058
- OK, it's just this way.
- Thank you.

1067
01:04:16,507 --> 01:04:18,020
Dad, Vlad. Vlad, Dad.

1068
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:23,896
Ladies and gentlemen, The Love Storm.

1069
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:25,858
The Love Storm!

1070
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:27,579
Joe, wrong one.

1071
01:04:27,627 --> 01:04:29,424
No, it's not that. That is...

1072
01:04:29,467 --> 01:04:31,219
That's the second-best film ever made.

1073
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,576
That's two minutes of teacher-pleasing magic.

1074
01:04:33,627 --> 01:04:39,577
But this, this is, without doubt,
the most intelligent, moving,

1075
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:43,097
and downright-horny little adult film
that Lila has ever seen.

1076
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:46,219
That's saying something,
because she's a dirty little monkey.

1077
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:51,661
So, here's to you guys,
the wonderful cast and crew of The Love Storm.

1078
01:04:51,707 --> 01:04:54,699
- Thanks, everybody.
- The Love Storm!

1079
01:04:54,747 --> 01:04:56,021
The Love Storm.

1080
01:04:56,747 --> 01:04:59,580
- Candy, I want to tell you that l...
- I know.

1081
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:11,744
Greetings, fellow pornographers.
We having a party, are we? Very nice.

1082
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:15,575
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's been a long time.

1083
01:05:15,627 --> 01:05:18,346
Honestly, woman,
you don't phone, you don't write.

1084
01:05:18,387 --> 01:05:20,696
I don't know what's going on here, but...

1085
01:05:20,747 --> 01:05:23,864
- What is going on here?
- All right, Van Damme, calm down.

1086
01:05:23,907 --> 01:05:27,024
What? A new admirer, is it?
Yeah, he's very cute.

1087
01:05:27,067 --> 01:05:29,058
Can't I have a drink with my leading lady?

1088
01:05:29,107 --> 01:05:31,701
Wishful thinking, but my agent already told you.

1089
01:05:31,747 --> 01:05:35,296
- I don't work for low-rent pimps like you.
- But, sweetheart, you just did.

1090
01:05:36,947 --> 01:05:40,383
Joe, what a pickle we've caused
with our little deception.

1091
01:05:40,427 --> 01:05:44,386
- Joe, what?
- You bastard. I trusted you.

1092
01:05:47,707 --> 01:05:49,504
I trusted you.

1093
01:05:52,707 --> 01:05:54,379
Time of the month, is it?

1094
01:05:55,387 --> 01:05:58,140
Lads? Yes? No?

1095
01:05:59,267 --> 01:06:01,258
Suit yourselves.

1096
01:06:01,307 --> 01:06:03,377
Now...

1097
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:07,102
- Where's my film?
- No way. We had a deal, silent partners.

1098
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:12,185
- This is our film. This is Baggy's film.
- We've got a contract and it's my film.

1099
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:13,501
There you go. Take it.

1100
01:06:13,547 --> 01:06:15,458
Baggy, what?

1101
01:06:15,507 --> 01:06:17,975
It's over, Joe. Forget it. This is all bullshit.

1102
01:06:18,027 --> 01:06:19,858
- Good luck with the screening.
- But...

1103
01:06:21,347 --> 01:06:23,258
Trouble in paradise?

1104
01:06:23,307 --> 01:06:25,025
You know what, Joe?

1105
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:27,697
You remind me of me when I was your age.

1106
01:06:27,747 --> 01:06:31,660
Except I didn't make so many cock-ups
and I was a little better-looking.

1107
01:06:31,707 --> 01:06:32,981
And I wasn't such a twat.

1108
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:40,145
Is yours on soon?

1109
01:06:40,907 --> 01:06:43,262
- Where's Baggy?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him.

1110
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:46,818
Yeah, big up Diego Meriachi.
Where are you, buddy?

1111
01:06:46,867 --> 01:06:49,779
There he is. Respect is due, brother.
Radical stuff.

1112
01:06:49,827 --> 01:06:54,139
OK, next up,
and a highly-anticipated collaboration.

1113
01:06:54,187 --> 01:06:55,586
John Bagley and Joe Clarke.

1114
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:58,016
This one has been shrouded in mystery,

1115
01:06:58,067 --> 01:07:01,696
so I guess we're looking at
a world premiere, here, folks.

1116
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:07,301
What do you say we kick back and enjoy
Uncovering The Language Of A Visual Event.

1117
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:14,057
- Baggy!
- Joe, I had to come and speak to you.

1118
01:07:14,107 --> 01:07:17,986
No, I know. It's been tough.
Doug, Candy, Lila, it's my fault.

1119
01:07:18,027 --> 01:07:20,746
I switched the films.
I had to see it on a big screen.

1120
01:07:21,947 --> 01:07:23,983
- What?
- Yeah.

1121
01:07:40,107 --> 01:07:41,506
That looks like our house.

1122
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:45,417
It is our house!
Joe didn't tell us he was using...

1123
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:50,416
Hello. Can I help you?

1124
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:53,823
I need someone to please undo these.
Please let me in.

1125
01:07:53,867 --> 01:07:57,542
The sound isn't very good,
but picture quality is better than I expected.

1126
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:03,500
I think you're going to be impressed,
Mr De Vere.

1127
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:05,617
It's different from our usual product.

1128
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:08,465
It's got heart. It's got soul.

1129
01:08:08,507 --> 01:08:12,705
It's got a pile of hard-earned cash resting on it,
so shut up and put it on.

1130
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,658
You're a dead man.

1131
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,146
Maybe this'll help.

1132
01:08:50,147 --> 01:08:51,262
Bend over.

1133
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:11,979
- Oi! Where's my porno?
- Doug.

1134
01:09:17,347 --> 01:09:18,746
No way!

1135
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,096
- Holy shit!
- Will you shut up?

1136
01:09:21,147 --> 01:09:23,980
- Not bad.
- You're not wrong there, Robby.

1137
01:09:41,587 --> 01:09:43,305
What was she doing with that pear?

1138
01:09:52,507 --> 01:09:57,058
- Joe, Joe, congratulations. What a premiere!
- Joe, could we have a word?

1139
01:09:57,107 --> 01:10:00,099
- Joe, what...
- Good, Mr Clarke, a quick chat.

1140
01:10:00,147 --> 01:10:01,785
Mr Dulberg, I think we need to talk.

1141
01:10:01,827 --> 01:10:04,057
Excuse me. I'd like a word with Joe's...

1142
01:10:04,107 --> 01:10:05,301
- Teacher.
- Dad.

1143
01:10:05,347 --> 01:10:06,939
- I'm Joe's teacher.
- I'm Joe's dad.

1144
01:10:06,987 --> 01:10:08,784
- This is Joe's dad.
- This is Joe's teacher.

1145
01:10:08,827 --> 01:10:10,465
- Mr Clarke?
- Mr Dulberg?

1146
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,065
Who is this man?

1147
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:14,496
Listen, I am telling you, I am Joe's father.

1148
01:10:15,347 --> 01:10:18,180
I did come here
with the express purpose of killing you,

1149
01:10:18,227 --> 01:10:21,822
but, seeing as you produced a work
of such outstanding quality,

1150
01:10:21,867 --> 01:10:26,383
and I'll probably have to stand in line
for the privilege, I'm going to leave you to it.

1151
01:10:26,427 --> 01:10:29,021
But Mr Dulberg came to my house.

1152
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:31,945
Rewind. I've never been to your house in my life.

1153
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:33,583
Right.

1154
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:36,460
- How dare you use our house...
- You think you're pretty clever.

1155
01:10:36,507 --> 01:10:38,862
-..your mother's in a state.
-..a stunt like this.

1156
01:10:38,907 --> 01:10:40,863
- She's talking about Florida.
- Stephen.

1157
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:46,504
You, the pair of you,
can forget about your diplomas.

1158
01:10:46,547 --> 01:10:49,015
You can forget about coming back to class.
That...

1159
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:51,217
That was totally uncool, guys.

1160
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,902
It's good. It's really very good.

1161
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:03,019
And you made this yourself?
You're a dark horse, Douglas.

1162
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:05,456
I think we might be in the running
for a Golden Cockerel.

1163
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:08,385
A Cock? What, for me?

1164
01:11:08,427 --> 01:11:09,860
I mean, for us?

1165
01:11:09,907 --> 01:11:11,420
And the winners are...

1166
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,300
Michael De Vere and Douglas Perry.

1167
01:11:14,707 --> 01:11:17,540
You keep this up, Doug,
and I might actually start to like you.

1168
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:24,378
It's my best work.

1169
01:11:33,587 --> 01:11:36,021
- You made a great film.
- For a bunch of gangsters.

1170
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:39,298
You humiliated me. I've lost Candy.
I got thrown out of college.

1171
01:11:40,947 --> 01:11:44,417
Bags, who cares about college?
We made a movie!

1172
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,900
You don't know how lucky you are.

1173
01:11:45,947 --> 01:11:48,825
You were born with talent.
I'd kill for an ounce of it.

1174
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:52,342
Listen, Baggy, I've been thinking.

1175
01:11:52,387 --> 01:11:54,298
We should start a new film.

1176
01:11:54,867 --> 01:11:56,903
I'll get the money, from a safe place this time.

1177
01:11:56,947 --> 01:12:00,098
- We'll call up Candy and...
- Stop, Joe. Just stop. Please.

1178
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:03,623
Look at me.
I'm John Bagley from Leatherhead.

1179
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,305
We had an excellent adventure,

1180
01:12:05,347 --> 01:12:08,339
more than some people have in a whole lifetime,
but it wasn't real.

1181
01:12:09,307 --> 01:12:12,822
- I'm not talented. They hated it.
- They didn't hate it.

1182
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:14,505
- Leave me alone.
- They were shocked,

1183
01:12:14,547 --> 01:12:18,062
because it was a dirty movie.
But it was a great dirty movie!

1184
01:12:18,107 --> 01:12:20,018
You got it right! Bags!

1185
01:12:35,947 --> 01:12:37,699
She would not sink with those, huh?

1186
01:12:42,587 --> 01:12:43,781
Wow!

1187
01:12:45,387 --> 01:12:47,503
- It's The Love Storm!
- The Love Storm!

1188
01:12:48,147 --> 01:12:49,421
We'd better tell Joe.

1189
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:50,741
- Go and tell Joe.
- Quick.

1190
01:13:01,827 --> 01:13:03,818
We too would like to speak with Joe,
please. Now.

1191
01:13:04,187 --> 01:13:06,496
- I'm sorry?
- The bad man want Joe's Cock.

1192
01:13:06,547 --> 01:13:08,060
What did you say?

1193
01:13:08,387 --> 01:13:10,855
The bad man, OK, he want

1194
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,815
Joe's, Joe's Cock.

1195
01:13:12,867 --> 01:13:15,176
No. No, no, no. You saying it wrong.

1196
01:13:15,467 --> 01:13:17,139
Let me explain it, please.

1197
01:13:17,747 --> 01:13:19,544
Your son, Joe,

1198
01:13:19,587 --> 01:13:21,862
all his life, he dream of Cock.

1199
01:13:21,907 --> 01:13:23,420
He talk about it all of the time.

1200
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:26,618
- "Cock, Cock, Cock. I want Cock."
- "l have to have Cock all to myself."

1201
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:29,977
But the bad man, he want Joe's Cock.

1202
01:13:30,587 --> 01:13:34,023
And he is taking Joe's Cock tonight.

1203
01:13:36,027 --> 01:13:37,426
Joe! Come here!

1204
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,866
His mother and l, we've always had
a bad feeling about all this.

1205
01:13:43,387 --> 01:13:45,343
- What's going on?
- For you.

1206
01:13:48,947 --> 01:13:50,824
Best film nomination: The Love Storm.

1207
01:13:51,107 --> 01:13:53,416
Directed by Doug Perry.
Produced by Michael De Vere.

1208
01:13:53,507 --> 01:13:56,863
- He's a bastard.
- More of this stuff, Joe? Why?

1209
01:13:56,907 --> 01:13:59,421
Look, Dad, listen, it's fine. I'll bin it. Don't worry.

1210
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:04,143
No. Hold on, hold on. I mean,
much as I keenly disapprove of what you did,

1211
01:14:04,187 --> 01:14:07,543
I have to admit that your film did have a certain...

1212
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,703
Yeah, it did, didn't it?

1213
01:14:13,747 --> 01:14:16,102
Now, you know I'm not a fan
of this kind of thing,

1214
01:14:16,147 --> 01:14:19,219
but it seems to me, you have to get up
to London and reclaim your film.

1215
01:14:19,987 --> 01:14:22,547
Here. Take the Mondeo.

1216
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:29,461
Guys, I'm going to need you. OK?

1217
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:32,621
Thank you.

1218
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:41,663
Lila, I really need your help.

1219
01:14:41,707 --> 01:14:44,096
Do you know what? Forget that.
Baggy needs your help.

1220
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:47,776
- I've told you already. I'm not interested.
- He say that you would said this.

1221
01:14:47,827 --> 01:14:52,264
And he said he have a special message for
you that it is all set and he have this big plan.

1222
01:14:52,307 --> 01:14:54,218
Yeah, yeah. I love his big plans.

1223
01:14:54,267 --> 01:14:55,586
Love his big plans.

1224
01:14:55,627 --> 01:14:57,538
We can have the Cock. Mr Baggy!

1225
01:14:58,507 --> 01:15:00,498
- Baggy!
- Baggy!

1226
01:15:15,027 --> 01:15:19,145
It's great to see you. All right?
We'll speak soon. Personally, I love the jacket.

1227
01:15:30,507 --> 01:15:31,860
Amazing.

1228
01:15:32,187 --> 01:15:34,337
- Hi, Joe.
- You look fantastic.

1229
01:15:34,387 --> 01:15:36,264
Where's Baggy? Why isn't he here yet?

1230
01:15:36,307 --> 01:15:37,820
- Joe! Joe!
- Lila.

1231
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,266
Lila!

1232
01:15:39,307 --> 01:15:41,218
He not make it.

1233
01:15:41,267 --> 01:15:43,337
I'm sorry, Lila, but we fail.

1234
01:15:44,307 --> 01:15:45,820
Baggy, he say, no.

1235
01:15:45,867 --> 01:15:47,664
He not want Joe's Cock.

1236
01:15:47,707 --> 01:15:50,779
You don't understand, Vlad.
This is for him. We're here for him.

1237
01:15:50,827 --> 01:15:53,625
It's my fault, all of this.

1238
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:56,056
I'm going to make it right.

1239
01:15:56,107 --> 01:15:57,620
Right now.

1240
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,545
Candy! Candy! Candy!

1241
01:16:01,747 --> 01:16:03,703
- Hey.
- What do you want?

1242
01:16:03,747 --> 01:16:05,863
- Leave me alone.
- Please, hear me out.

1243
01:16:05,907 --> 01:16:08,421
I'm sorry for what happened.
I shouldn't have lied to you.

1244
01:16:08,467 --> 01:16:11,664
Well, if you're here to pick up an award,
you're out of luck.

1245
01:16:11,707 --> 01:16:13,140
Looks like you got screwed, too.

1246
01:16:13,187 --> 01:16:16,657
I don't care about the awards, Candy.
I'm here because of Baggy.

1247
01:16:16,707 --> 01:16:19,779
I had to let you know.
He didn't know anything about Doug Perry.

1248
01:16:20,507 --> 01:16:25,706
I lied to him too. I'm not asking you to forgive me,
but you have to forgive him.

1249
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:30,063
Look, I was an idiot for getting involved
with you guys in the first place.

1250
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:33,224
You're just kids. We're from different worlds.

1251
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:39,225
Ladies and gentlemen,

1252
01:16:39,267 --> 01:16:42,816
welcome to the Fifteenth annual
Golden Cockerel Awards.

1253
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:47,702
The ultimate recognition of achievement
in adult-oriented entertainment.

1254
01:16:47,747 --> 01:16:51,183
So, please take your seats
and I'd watch where you sit,

1255
01:16:51,227 --> 01:16:54,776
as we honour
this year's outstanding individuals.

1256
01:16:57,547 --> 01:17:03,099
So, saw The Love Storm.
Got to say, I loved it, very impressed.

1257
01:17:03,147 --> 01:17:06,105
Watched it beginning to end. I'm a little sore.

1258
01:17:06,147 --> 01:17:08,980
Yeah, well, it's a porno.
It's not proper filmmaking.

1259
01:17:09,027 --> 01:17:12,303
You made a great film.
What's wrong with getting your start in erotica?

1260
01:17:12,347 --> 01:17:14,258
My customers think it's a masterpiece.

1261
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:18,419
I'm serious. They love it. Can't get enough.

1262
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,664
The story, the characters,
the classic denouement

1263
01:17:21,707 --> 01:17:24,540
and there are some very good dirty bits.

1264
01:17:24,747 --> 01:17:27,705
You know what they say,
sex is only dirty if you're doing it right.

1265
01:17:40,827 --> 01:17:43,387
Presenting our Best Film Award this evening,

1266
01:17:43,427 --> 01:17:47,181

1267
01:17:47,227 --> 01:17:50,105

01:18:21,187 --> 01:18:22,745
Yes.

1277
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:24,786

And the winner is...

1279
01:18:32,747 --> 01:18:36,103

1281
01:18:56,467 --> 01:18:59,698
Produced by Joe Clarke
and directed by John Bagley.

1282
01:19:16,347 --> 01:19:20,101
Congratulations to the real team
behind The Love Storm!

1283
01:19:31,187 --> 01:19:32,825
Thank you, everyone.

1284
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:34,940
Thank you.

1285
01:19:39,267 --> 01:19:40,461
This is a...

1286
01:19:40,507 --> 01:19:42,304
This is a fantastic award.

1287
01:19:42,347 --> 01:19:43,496
It's a really...

1288
01:19:43,547 --> 01:19:45,742
It's a really chunky prize.

1289
01:19:45,787 --> 01:19:47,106
But...

1290
01:19:47,147 --> 01:19:51,220
It belongs to someone who can't be
with us tonight, unfortunately.

1291
01:19:51,267 --> 01:19:54,225
But, nevertheless,
this stands as real, concrete,

1292
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:56,861
undeniable proof
of the talent behind the camera.

1293
01:19:57,267 --> 01:19:58,666
And that's a guy...

1294
01:20:02,307 --> 01:20:03,945
And that's a guy called John Bagley.

1295
01:20:06,387 --> 01:20:08,378
Please, you're embarrassing me.

1296
01:20:08,707 --> 01:20:12,382
Sorry I couldn't be here in person
to accept this award, but, thank you.

1297
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:16,380
Making this film has been
an unbelievable experience.

1298
01:20:16,427 --> 01:20:19,305
I've learnt so much.
I've seen some amazing things.

1299
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:21,986
One horrific thing,
but I won't go into that now.

1300
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:24,587
Thank goodness for Wet Wipes.
That's all I'm going to say.

1301
01:20:24,627 --> 01:20:29,417
I'd like to thank the cast and crew
and most of all, my best mate, Joe Clarke,

1302
01:20:29,467 --> 01:20:31,776
for making me do shit I don't want to do.

1303
01:20:33,147 --> 01:20:34,660
God bless erotica!

1304
01:21:34,787 --> 01:21:36,698
>> The first time I saw her

1305
01:21:37,667 --> 01:21:39,942
>> I wanted more than just to hold her

1306
01:21:40,627 --> 01:21:43,221
>> I wanted to bend her and fold her

1307
01:21:43,267 --> 01:21:46,225
>> So I leant over and I told her

1308
01:21:46,267 --> 01:21:48,940

1309

1313
01:22:00,267 --> 01:22:03,304
>> Got the contraception,
haven't got the knack yet

1314
01:22:03,347 --> 01:22:06,100
>> We've tried it a variety of ways

1315
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:08,906
>> I've not slept in about four days

1316

1326
01:22:43,587 --> 01:22:45,339
