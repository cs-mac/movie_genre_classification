{5087}{5150}"Good luck tonight.|Elle and Warner forever."
{5150}{5197}Oh, that's so cute.
{5575}{5665}Oh, my gosh!|You guys are so sweet!
{5675}{5735}But I'm not positive|it's gonna happen tonight.
{5738}{5800}Hello! He just had lunch|with his grandmother.
{5800}{5837}You know he got the rock.
{5838}{5891}Why else would she have flown in|from Newport?
{5891}{5943}It's not like she'd Fed Ex|a six-carat diamond.
{5944}{5984}Do you really think?
{5990}{6051}I can't believe|you're getting engaged!
{6070}{6085}Oh, my gosh...
{6101}{6176}you guys have to help me|pick out the perfect outfit.
{6176}{6202}Come on!
{6216}{6251}I think you should go|with the red.
{6251}{6293}It's the color of confidence.
{6295}{6351}I don't understand|why you're completely disregarding...
{6351}{6376}your signature color.
{6376}{6462}He's proposing. I can't look|like I would on any other date.
{6464}{6551}This is THE date--|the night I'll always remember.
{6551}{6611}I want to look special.
{6626}{6663}Bridal.
{6666}{6701}But not like I expect anything.
{6701}{6739}There's nothing I love more...
{6739}{6802}than a dumb blonde|with daddy's plastic.
{6802}{6900}Did you see this one?|We just got it in yesterday.
{6926}{6977}Is this low-viscosity rayon?
{6977}{7031}Yes. Of course.
{7041}{7091}With a half-loop|top-stitching on the hem?
{7091}{7150}Absolutely. It's one of a kind.
{7194}{7252}It's impossible to use|a half-loop top-stitching...
{7252}{7327}on low-viscosity rayon.|It would snag the fabric.
{7327}{7366}And you didn't just get it in.
{7366}{7402}I saw it in the June Vogue|a year ago.
{7402}{7457}So if you're trying to sell it|for full price...
{7469}{7524}you picked the wrong girl.
{7642}{7692}Girls, this is it.
{7728}{7752}In a few hours...
{7752}{7852}I'll be the future|Mrs. Warner Huntington III.
{8150}{8175}Hello.
{8643}{8728}Wow. You look so beautiful.
{8728}{8756}So do you.
{9009}{9050}Let's get out of here.
{9454}{9538}Must be strange|having such perfect eyes.
{9579}{9668}God, you're so wonderful.|Elle, thank you.
{9744}{9780}Here's to us.
{9780}{9806}To us.
{10015}{10055}- Elle?|- Yes!
{10090}{10130}One of the reasons I wanted|to come here tonight...
{10130}{10180}was to discuss our future.
{10192}{10280}And I am fully amenable|to that discussion.
{10280}{10330}Good. Well, you know how|we've been having...
{10330}{10380}all kinds of fun lately?|- Ya.
{10380}{10455}Well, Harvard|is gonna be different.
{10455}{10530}Law school is|a completely different world...
{10530}{10572}and I need to be serious.
{10572}{10605}Of course.
{10625}{10705}I mean, my family expects a lot from me.
{10705}{10756}- Right.|- I expect a lot from me.
{10756}{10806}I plan on running|for office someday.
{10806}{10870}And I fully support that, Warner.|You know that, right?
{10870}{10930}Absolutely.|But the thing is...
{10930}{11006}if I'm going to be a senator|by the time I'm thirty...
{11006}{11056}I need to stop dicking around.
{11056}{11155}Warner, I completely agree.
{11206}{11261}Well that's why I think|it's time for us...
{11272}{11349}- Elle, pooh bear...|- Yes...
{11418}{11530}- I do.|- I think we should break up.
{11581}{11606}What?
{11606}{11681}I've been thinking about it,|and it's the right thing to do.
{11681}{11756}You're breaking up with me?
{11756}{11806}I thought you were proposing.
{11806}{11856}Proposing?
{11856}{11932}Elle, if I'm going to be|a senator...
{11932}{12021}Well I need to marry a Jackie,|not a Marilyn.
{12032}{12126}So you're breaking up with me|because I'm too blonde?
{12132}{12174}No. That's not entirely true.
{12174}{12232}Then what?|My boobs are too big?
{12242}{12307}Elle, your boobs are fine.
{12307}{12382}So when you said|that you would always love me...
{12382}{12407}you were just... dicking around?
{12407}{12472}Elle, I, I-- I do love you.
{12492}{12557}I just can't marry you.
{12557}{12619}You have no idea|of the pressure that I am under.
{12619}{12682}My family has|five generations of senators.
{12682}{12732}My brother's in the top three|at Yale Law.
{12732}{12832}And he just got engaged to|a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake.
{13108}{13162}Bad salad.
{13183}{13233}Sweetie...
{13233}{13333}Pooh bear?
{13333}{13432}It's not like I have a choice|here, sweetheart!
{13458}{13508}OK, you get the car,|I'll get the check.
{13508}{13542}I won't be having salad.
{13759}{13802}Come on, let me take you home.
{13809}{13822}No!
{13834}{13909}Elle, believe me.|I never expected to do this...
{13909}{13959}but I think|it's the right thing.
{13959}{14034}How can it be the right thing|when we're not together?
{14034}{14084}Well, I have to think of my future...
{14084}{14134}and what my family expects|of me.
{14134}{14159}So you're breaking up with me...
{14159}{14234}because you're afraid|your family won't like me?
{14234}{14280}Everybody likes me.
{14280}{14334}Well, East Coast people are different.
{14334}{14403}What, just because I'm not a Vanderbilt,|suddenly I'm white trash?
{14403}{14459}I grew up in Bel Air, Warner!
{14459}{14494}Across the street|from Aaron Spelling!
{14494}{14552}I think most people would agree|that's a lot better...
{14552}{14604}than some stinky old Vanderbilt!
{14604}{14698}I told you.|I need someone serious.
{14734}{14802}But I'm seriously in love|with you.
{14860}{14910}Isn't that enough?
{14910}{14964}Pooh bear, just get in the car.
{15034}{15052}No.
{15110}{15177}You're gonna ruin your shoes.
{15295}{15312}OK.
{16561}{16598}Morning, Amy.
{16747}{16786}Elle, it's Amy.
{16784}{16859}I'm-- I'm having trouble|with this whole lip-liner thing.
{16862}{16936}- Sweetie, didn't you hear?|- Hear what?
{16936}{16996}It's terrible.|He dumped her.
{17037}{17076}Why me?
{17087}{17156}Because you're not gonna|remember anything after tonight.
{17212}{17248}Oh, you're wrong.
{17287}{17354}I will remember, no matter what.
{17387}{17448}And I'm never gonna lose you|again.
{17462}{17520}You couldn't.
{17537}{17570}You're a part of me.
{17612}{17656}I love you.
{17672}{17712}Liar!
{17712}{17788}Honey,|you have to leave this room.
{17788}{17838}It's been, like, a week.
{17838}{17912}- So?|- Drink this.
{17912}{17963}What's the one thing that always makes us|feel better...
{17963}{18020}no matter what?
{18113}{18188}She had eight|grilled cheese sandwiches.
{18188}{18238}She stuffed them|in her mouth all at once.
{18238}{18263}It was so sad.
{18263}{18328}We all thought she'd be the first|to walk down the aisle...
{18328}{18398}and now she's totally adrift.
{18398}{18436}Totally.
{18481}{18538}She hasn't conditioned|her hair in, like, a week.
{18538}{18588}Maybe she's going|for the grunge look.
{18588}{18653}And like, her nails|are full-on chipped.
{18653}{18727}So trailer park.
{18728}{18822}[ She'll never get him back|with those cuticles ]
{18832}{18900}[ No shit.]
{18976}{19051}Oh, my God!|Do you know who this is?
{19052}{19078}No...
{19076}{19151}- That's Warner's older brother!|- Who?
{19164}{19239}Third year Yale Law student|Putnam Bowes Huntington III...
{19239}{19339}and his fiancee|Layne Walker Vanderbilt...
{19339}{19438}first year Yale Law."
{19464}{19539}This is the type of girl|that Warner wants to marry!
{19539}{19614}This is what I need to become|to be serious!
{19614}{19664}What?|Practically deformed?
{19664}{19764}No. A law student.
{19892}{19942}Elle?
{19940}{19965}Law school?
{19965}{20040}It's a perfectly|respectable place, daddy.
{20040}{20115}Honey,|you were first runner up...
{20115}{20165}at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics|contest.
{20170}{20220}Why are you gonna|throw that all away?
{20215}{20265}Going to Harvard|is the only way...
{20265}{20315}I'm gonna get|the love of my life back.
{20315}{20365}Sweetheart,|you don't need law school.
{20365}{20415}Law school is for people...
{20415}{20515}who are boring and ugly|and serious.
{20515}{20594}And you, Button,|are none of those things.
{20685}{20730}Harvard Law School?
{20740}{20774}That's right.
{20816}{20857}But that's a top three school.
{20858}{20916}Oh, I have a 4.0.
{20916}{21015}Yes, but your major|is fashion merchandising.
{21045}{21165}Harvard won't be impressed that|you aced History of Polka Dots.
{21253}{21296}What are your back-ups?
{21291}{21365}I don't need back-ups.|I'm going to Harvard.
{21391}{21441}Well, then, you'll need...
{21441}{21541}excellent recommendations|from your professors.
{21491}{21541}OK.
{21541}{21610}And a heck|of an admissions essay.
{21610}{21641}Right.
{21641}{21751}And at least a 175|on your LSATs.
{21792}{21842}I once had to judge|a tighty-whitey contest...
{21842}{21866}for Lambda Kappa Pi.
{21866}{21966}Trust me, I can handle anything.
{22077}{22106}Thanks!
{22132}{22186}Welcome.
{22200}{22250}Because I have-- I have a metrabolism--
{22267}{22366}- I have a really high metrab--|- It's metabol...
{22442}{22478}Oh, my God.
{22492}{22546}What are you doing?
{22567}{22607}Reading about the LSATs.
{22632}{22667}My cousin had that.
{22667}{22739}Apparently, you get|a really bad rash on your...
{22792}{22832}The LSATs are an exam.
{22837}{22892}Girls, I'm going to Harvard!
{22892}{22960}- You mean like on vay-kay?|- Let's all go!
{22960}{22990}Road trip!
{23043}{23101}No. I'm going|to Harvard Law School.
{23153}{23175}Why?
{23193}{23293}Elle, now, I know|you're upset about all this...
{23293}{23347}but can't you just take|a Percoset?
{23368}{23462}OK, once Warner sees me|as a serious law student...
{23462}{23493}he'll totally want me back.
{23493}{23543}It's a completely brilliant|plan!
{23548}{23623}But isn't it hard|to get into law school?
{23606}{23674}Well I had the highest GPA|in Delta Nu...
{23737}{23818}Oh, well.|Here, you're gonna need this.
{23837}{23868}Your scrunchy?
{23877}{23968}My lucky scrunchy.|It helped me pass Spanish.
{23981}{24031}You passed Spanish because|you gave Professor Montoya...
{24044}{24094}a lap dance after the final.
{24094}{24182}Yeah... luckily.
{24339}{24389}Oh, hi!
{24404}{24494}My name is Elle Woods,|and for my admissions essay...
{24494}{24544}I'm gonna tell all of you|at Harvard...
{24544}{24613}why I'm gonna make|an amazing lawyer.
{24630}{24672}As president of my sorority...
{24679}{24744}I'm skilled at commanding|the attention of a room...
{24744}{24784}and discussing|very important issues.
{24785}{24844}It has come to my attention|that the maintenance staff...
{24844}{24905}is switching our toilet paper|from Charmin...
{24920}{24970}to generic.
{24970}{25069}All those opposed to chafing|please say "aye".
{25095}{25138}A--neither type of opera...
{25138}{25184}or neither type of rap|is on sale.
{25172}{25208}B--neither type of jazz...
{25212}{25262}and neither type of opera|is on sale.
{25262}{25338}C--neither type of opera|and neither type of soul--
{25360}{25459}Party!|Delta Nu, we love you!
{25570}{25645}I'm able to recall|hundreds of important details...
{25645}{25670}at the drop of a hat.
{25670}{25720}Hey, Elle,|do you know what happened...
{25720}{25795}on Days of Our Lives yesterday?
{25795}{25820}Why, yes, Margot, I do.
{25820}{25895}Once again, we join Hope|in the search for her identity.
{25895}{25972}As you know, she's been|brainwashed by the evil Stefano.
{26031}{26073}Get set and go!
{26341}{26383}One forty-three.
{26479}{26578}I feel comfortable using|legal jargon in everyday life.
{26621}{26668}I object!
{27022}{27066}It's here!
{27097}{27147}- What?|- It's here!
{27127}{27177}The LSAT scores! It's here!
{27197}{27234}Open the scores!
{27297}{27330}What's the score?
{27372}{27422}- This is so exciting.|- Tell us!
{27422}{27456}What is it?
{27497}{27544}One seventy-nine!
{27772}{27809}One seventy-nine!
{28048}{28098}And that's why|you should vote for me...
{28098}{28197}Elle Woods,future lawyer|for the class of 2004.
{28348}{28448}She does have a 4.0 from CULA...
{28448}{28523}and she got a 179 on her LSATs.
{28523}{28573}A fashion major?
{28573}{28623}Well, sir,|we've never had one before...
{28623}{28673}and aren't we always|looking for diversity?
{28673}{28773}Her list of extracurricular|activities is impressive.
{28773}{28823}She was in a Ricky Martin video.
{28823}{28898}Clearly,|she's interested in music.
{28898}{29013}She also designed|a line of faux fur panties...
{29024}{29074}for her sorority's|charity project.
{29074}{29173}She's a friend to the animals|as well as a philanthropist.
{29199}{29230}Elle Woods...
{29298}{29342}welcome to Harvard.
{30900}{30976}Oh Bruiser, it's so exciting!|Look! Harvard!
{30983}{31020}Are you excited?
{31301}{31351}This is our new house|for the next three years.
{31351}{31395}Oh, are you thirsty?
{31407}{31455}OK, let's get you some water.
{31476}{31510}Sweetheart,|you just look parched.
{31541}{31595}Hey, Brad,|check out Malibu Barbie!
{31621}{31680}Where's the beach, honey?
{31701}{31727}Here you go.
{31727}{31827}Good boy. Warner's gonna be|so excited to see you.
{31827}{31877}Guys, this way.
{31877}{31924}- This ain't L.A.!|- Come on, Bruiser.
{31977}{32052}Yeah, check her out.|Look at the way she walks.
{32052}{32102}Oh, it's gonna be so exciting.
{32102}{32149}Now, don't be scared.|Everyone will love you.
{32277}{32345}Hi. Woods, comma, Elle.
{32467}{32534}Class schedule, map, book list.
{32617}{32702}Wait a second. My social events|calendar is missing.
{32717}{32767}Your what?
{32752}{32828}Social events--|you know, mixers,formals...
{32822}{32880}clambakes, trips to the Cape.
{32962}{33062}OK, has Warner Huntington III|checked in yet?
{33050}{33100}Ah... no.
{33103}{33178}No. You know, maybe you should check|with the cruise director...
{33185}{33223}on the Lido deck.
{33286}{33360}OK, welcome to law school.
{33353}{33428}This is the part where|we go around in a circle...
{33428}{33503}and everyone says a little bit|about themselves.
{33513}{33563}Let's start with you.
{33553}{33628}My name is David Kidney.
{33628}{33703}I have a masters|in Russian literature...
{33703}{33754}a Ph.D in biochemistry...
{33754}{33804}and for the last|eighteen months...
{33804}{33902}I've been deworming orphans|in Somalia.
{33943}{33992}Awesome. What about you?
{34004}{34054}Hey. How you doin'?|I'm Enid Wexler.
{34054}{34104}I got a Ph.D. from Berkeley|in women's studies...
{34104}{34154}emphasis|in the history of combat...
{34154}{34229}and last year,|I single-handedly organized...
{34229}{34279}the march for|Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.
{34279}{34354}- Killer.|- Thanks. Good times.
{34364}{34414}Aaron Mitchell.
{34404}{34454}I graduated first in my class|from Princeton.
{34454}{34504}I have an I.Q. of 187...
{34504}{34579}and it's been suggested|that Stephen Hawking...
{34579}{34654}stole|his Brief History of Time...
{34654}{34704}from my fourth grade paper.
{34704}{34728}Cool.
{34754}{34804}- Me?|- Yeah.
{34815}{34921}OK. Hi. I'm Elle Woods|and this is Bruiser Woods...
{34930}{34984}and we're both|Gemini vegetarians.
{34990}{35055}I have a bachelor's degree|in fashion merchandising...
{35055}{35155}from CULA, and I was|a Zeta Lambda Nu sweetheart...
{35155}{35205}president of my sorority,|Delta Nu...
{35205}{35263}and last year,|I was homecoming queen.
{35292}{35342}Oh! Two weeks ago I saw|Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal...
{35355}{35400}and I talked her|out of buying...
{35400}{35438}this truly heinous|angora sweater.
{35438}{35512}Whoever said orange was the new|pink was seriously disturbed.
{35658}{35708}Wish me luck, Bruiser.
{35705}{35773}This is my first class|as a serious law student.
{35930}{35978}I totally look the part.
{36131}{36188}There is no way|she got in here on her own.
{36206}{36250}Hi!
{36270}{36313}Hi!
{36898}{36950}I totally forgot you go here.
{36956}{37007}What are you talking about?
{37017}{37074}I'm sorry.|Are you here to see me?
{37074}{37136}No, silly. I go here.
{37157}{37182}You go where?
{37182}{37241}Harvard. Law school.
{37257}{37322}You got into Harvard Law?
{37332}{37382}What, like it's hard?
{37382}{37432}Oh, my gosh, Warner,|it'll be so great.
{37432}{37501}I'm planning this great mixer.|You have to help me.
{37501}{37574}I'm thinking like|a luau or casino night.
{37574}{37641}It'll be just like senior year|except funner.
{37693}{37758}Time to go.|I have to go to class...
{37758}{37808}but meet me after|on the benches.
{37808}{37854}All right, bye!
{38258}{38358}A legal education|means you will learn...
{38358}{38442}to speak in a new language.
{38458}{38508}You will be taught|to achieve insight...
{38508}{38583}into the world around you...
{38583}{38682}and to sharply question|what you know.
{38734}{38808}The seat you have picked|will be yours...
{38808}{38898}for the next nine months|of your life.
{38908}{38988}And those of you|in the front row...
{39009}{39057}beware.
{39109}{39198}"The law is reason|free from passion."
{39198}{39302}Does anyone know|who spoke those immortal words?
{39359}{39411}- Yes?|- Aristotle.
{39559}{39634}- Are you sure?|- Yes!
{39634}{39723}Would you be willing|to stake your life on it?
{39760}{39799}I think so.
{39874}{39963}What about his life?
{40085}{40110}I don't know.
{40110}{40226}Well, I recommend|knowing before speaking.
{40241}{40344}The law leaves much room|for interpretation...
{40360}{40450}but very little for self-doubt.
{40456}{40499}And you were right.
{40553}{40600}It was Aristotle.
{40610}{40660}Good job.
{40660}{40760}Now, I assume all of you|have read pages 1-48...
{40760}{40836}and are now well-versed|in subject matter jurisdiction.
{40836}{40936}Who can tell us about|Gordon vs. Steele?
{40936}{41035}Let's call on someone|from the hot zone.
{41436}{41488}Elle Woods?
{41586}{41685}Actually, I wasn't aware|that we had an assignment.
{41987}{42037}Vivian Kensington.
{42037}{42136}Do you think it's acceptable|that Ms. Woods is not prepared?
{42262}{42312}I don't.
{42312}{42412}Would you support my decision|to ask her to leave class...
{42412}{42487}and to return|only when she is prepared?
{42487}{42534}Absolutely.
{43013}{43038}Now, Ms. Kensington...
{43038}{43138}did diversity jurisdiction|exist in this case?
{43138}{43196}No, it did not.
{43213}{43288}Good. How about in the case|of Owens vs. McCullogh?
{43288}{43363}I can't believe that girl.
{43363}{43400}So stupid!
{43588}{43638}Who does she think she is?
{43638}{43706}Excuse me. Are you OK?
{43764}{43838}Do they put you on the spot|like that all the time?
{43838}{43888}The professors?
{43888}{43964}They tend to do that.|Socratic method.
{43964}{44064}If you don't know the answers,|they just kick you out?
{44064}{44114}You have Stromwell, huh?
{44114}{44164}Yes!|Did she do that to you, too?
{44164}{44214}No.|But she did make me cry once.
{44214}{44289}Not in class. I waited|till I got back to my room...
{44289}{44339}but she'll kick you|right in the ball--
{44339}{44389}Or wherever, you know.
{44389}{44439}She's really tough.
{44439}{44489}Great.
{44489}{44539}Don't worry, it gets better.|Who else do you have?
{44570}{44649}I have Callahan, Royalton,|and Levinthal.
{44689}{44740}Let's see, speak up|in Callahan's class.
{44740}{44814}He really likes people|that are opinionated.
{44814}{44864}And in Royalton's class...
{44886}{44940}try to get a seat in the back.
{44940}{45015}He spits when he talks|about products liability.
{45015}{45115}And for Levinthal, make sure|you read the footnotes.
{45115}{45182}That's where he gets|a lot of his exam questions.
{45182}{45223}Right.
{45272}{45348}Wow.|I'm really glad I met you.
{45440}{45465}Are you a third year?
{45465}{45540}- Well--|- Hey, Elle.
{45540}{45598}Hi!|Thanks for all your help.
{45605}{45641}Good luck.
{45790}{45820}So...
{45833}{45866}how was your first class?
{45866}{45940}It was good, except for|this horrible preppy girl...
{45940}{45976}who made me look bad|in front of the professor.
{45976}{46016}But no biggie.
{46016}{46091}You're here now.|So, how was your summer?
{46091}{46141}Good. It was good.
{46141}{46203}Did you do anything exciting?
{46291}{46366}Have you met Vivian?
{46366}{46465}Hi. Vivian Kensington.
{46491}{46541}Do you know her?
{46541}{46620}- She's--|- I'm his fiancee.
{46816}{46916}I'm sorry.|I just hallucinated. What?
{46916}{47017}She was my girlfriend|in prep school.
{47017}{47067}And, well, we got back together|this summer...
{47067}{47142}at my grandmother's|birthday party.
{47142}{47192}Warner told me all about you.
{47202}{47267}You're famous at our club.
{47277}{47346}But he didn't tell me|you'd be here.
{47367}{47435}Pooh bear,|I didn't know she would be here.
{47517}{47554}Excuse me.
{47968}{48004}Oh, thank God!
{48443}{48493}Are you free?|It's an emergency.
{48493}{48543}Bad day?
{48543}{48600}You can't even imagine.
{48693}{48718}Spill.
{48718}{48818}I worked so hard|to get into law school.
{48818}{48868}I blew off Greek week|to study for the LSATs.
{48868}{48944}I even hired a Coppola|to direct my admissions video.
{48944}{48994}All to get|my boyfriend Warner back.
{48994}{49044}And now he's engaged|to this awful girl Vivian...
{49044}{49119}so it was all for nothing,|and I...
{49119}{49169}I just wish...
{49169}{49241}I just wish|I had never gone to Harvard.
{49250}{49319}After you went|to all that trouble.
{49319}{49369}He's engaged!
{49369}{49419}She's got|the six-carat Harry Winston...
{49419}{49476}on her bony, unpolished finger.
{49555}{49598}What am I supposed to do?
{49613}{49655}You're asking the wrong girl.
{49669}{49720}I mean, I'm with my guy|eight years...
{49720}{49770}and then one day, it's...
{49770}{49844}I met someone else.|Move out.
{49844}{49920}Oh, no. That's awful.
{49920}{50019}Dewey kept the trailer|and my precious baby Rufus.
{50095}{50166}I didn't even get to throw him|a birthday party.
{50195}{50249}What's a girl to do?
{50263}{50320}He's a guy|who followed his pecker...
{50320}{50370}to greener pastures...
{50370}{50445}and I'm a middle-aged|high-school dropout...
{50445}{50520}who's got stretch marks|and a fat ass.
{50520}{50570}That's terrible.
{50570}{50644}Yep. Happens every day.
{50695}{50770}So what's this Vivian got|that you don't have?
{50770}{50796}Three tits?
{50806}{50846}She's from Connecticut.
{50846}{50896}She belongs|to his stupid country club.
{50906}{50960}Is she as pretty as you?
{50981}{51061}She could use some mascara|and some serious highlights, but...
{51072}{51145}she's not completely|unfortunate looking.
{51196}{51221}Hello, ladies.
{51221}{51246}Hey, there?
{51246}{51302}How you doing? Sign here.
{51471}{51521}Oh, jeez.
{51521}{51571}Look what I did.
{51571}{51630}- See you later.|- Bye-bye, sugar.
{51671}{51696}Aw, shit.
{51709}{51797}Could I have been|any more goddamn spastic?
{51797}{51834}It's OK.
{51872}{51955}Are you sure this|Warner guy is, like, the one?
{51957}{52046}Definitely. I love him.
{52122}{52197}Well, if a girl like you|can't hold on to her man...
{52197}{52296}then there sure as hell isn't|any hope for the rest of us.
{52322}{52366}What are you waiting for?
{52422}{52473}Steal the bastard back.
{52588}{52622}I should warn you...
{52622}{52672}that in addition to competing|against each other...
{52672}{52722}for the top grade|in this class...
{52722}{52797}you will also be competing|for one of my firm's...
{52797}{52897}highly coveted four|internship spots next year...
{52897}{52970}where you will get to assist|on actual cases.
{52978}{53051}Let the bloodbath begin.
{53098}{53168}Now, let's commence|with our usual torture.
{53198}{53231}Ms. Woods...
{53273}{53323}would you rather have a client|who committed a crime...
{53323}{53422}malum in se|or malum prohibitum?
{53498}{53548}Neither.
{53548}{53598}And why is that?
{53598}{53697}I would rather have a client|who's innocent.
{53724}{53822}Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.
{53874}{53948}Ms. Kensington,|which would you prefer?
{53948}{54049}Malum prohibitum.
{54049}{54099}Because then the client|would have committed...
{54099}{54199}a regulatory infraction as|opposed to a dangerous crime.
{54199}{54249}Well done, Ms. Kensington.
{54249}{54324}You've obviously done|your homework.
{54324}{54399}Now let us look|at malum prohibitum...
{54399}{54424}a little more closely.
{54424}{54499}It has been said--|Yes, Ms. Woods?
{54499}{54599}I changed my mind.|I'd pick the dangerous one...
{54599}{54682}'cause I'm not afraid|of a challenge.
{55000}{55029}Who is that?
{55150}{55199}Wow.
{55200}{55229}Guys.
{55250}{55318}- Can she play?|- Hi!
{55375}{55443}Get outta here.
{55625}{55686}- Hi, everybody.|- Elle, what are you doing here?
{55691}{55730}I've come to join|your study group.
{55730}{55794}And look, I brought sustenance.|Who's first?
{55826}{55869}Our group is full.
{55900}{55950}Is this like an RSVP thing?
{55950}{56001}No. It's like|a smart people thing.
{56011}{56076}And as Viv said, we're full.
{56076}{56133}Come on guys, we can make room|for one more.
{56161}{56220}We've already assigned|the outlines.
{56251}{56298}The answer is no.
{56501}{56600}Oh, OK.|I'll just leave, then.
{56776}{56826}Hey, maybe|there's, like, a sorority...
{56826}{56876}you could, like,|join instead, like?
{56876}{56926}If you had come|to a rush party...
{56926}{56977}I would have at least|been nice to you.
{56977}{57027}Is that before|you voted against me...
{57027}{57077}and then called me a dyke|behind my back?
{57077}{57131}I don't use that word.
{57152}{57230}You must have heard it|from Vivian.
{57853}{57903}- Hello?|- Hey, it's me.
{57903}{58003}It's Elle! Guess what|I'm doing right this second!
{58003}{58053}I don't know. What?
{58053}{58128}I'm picking out|my wedding dress!
{58128}{58186}- What?|- Josh proposed!
{58228}{58266}Did you get the rock yet?
{58324}{58353}Almost.
{58353}{58403}Well, hurry up,|so you can come home!
{58403}{58428}We miss you!
{58428}{58503}I miss you guys, too.|The people here are so vile.
{58503}{58553}Hardly anybody speaks to me--
{58553}{58628}Oh, my God!|I almost forgot to tell you!
{58628}{58653}What?
{58653}{58728}I got bangs!|My hair is so now.
{58728}{58753}Really?
{58753}{58803}OK, so just listen to me.
{58803}{58903}Keep June 1st open,|you're one of my bridesmaids...
{58903}{58953}and give Warner our love...
{58953}{59053}because I'm getting married!
{59254}{59354}So don't forget. Eight o'clock|at 45 Dunston Street.
{59354}{59404}- It'll be a really nice party.|- We'll be there.
{59404}{59479}And don't forget|to bring your own merlot!
{59479}{59579}No way! Is somebody at this|school actually having a party?
{59584}{59617}Yes...
{59679}{59718}But it's a costume party.
{59718}{59758}You probably|wouldn't want to come.
{59804}{59853}I love costume parties.
{59904}{59962}Well, then I guess|we'll see you there.
{60030}{60097}Oh, at 45 Dunston Street.
{60580}{60617}Oh, my God!
{61081}{61180}Thanks for inviting me, girls.|This party is super fun.
{61206}{61256}Nice outfit.
{61256}{61281}I like your outfit, too.
{61281}{61331}Except when I dress up|as a frigid bitch...
{61331}{61430}I try not to look|so constipated.
{61481}{61556}Oh, she's horrible.
{61556}{61618}You've got the ring, sweetie.
{61732}{61756}- Nice ears.|- How you doin'?
{61756}{61806}Warner,|the English language...
{61806}{61856}is all about|subliminal domination.
{61856}{61906}Take the word semester.
{61906}{61956}A perfect example|of this school's...
{61956}{62007}discriminatory preference|of semen to ovaries.
{62007}{62057}That's why I'm petitioning|to have next term...
{62057}{62132}be referred to|as the winter ovester.
{62132}{62207}- Excuse me. Hey, Warner.|- Wow!
{62207}{62257}Don't you look like|a walking felony?
{62257}{62357}Thank you. You're so sweet.
{62357}{62382}Are you having fun?
{62382}{62457}I am now.|What's with the costume?
{62457}{62532}I just decided to dress up.
{62532}{62557}Really.
{62557}{62607}I feel like we barely|get to see each other...
{62607}{62632}since we've been here.
{62632}{62707}I know. I'm so busy with|these case studies and hypos.
{62707}{62758}I know what you mean.|I can't imagine doing...

{67612}{67687}Listen to me, Dewey.|You shut your mouth.
{67711}{67756}No, you shut your big mouth.
{67788}{67855}I'm doing all the talking.
{68113}{68138}What the hell do you want?
{68156}{68188}We're eating lunch.
{68188}{68263}I just thought that...
{68263}{68338}You just thought|you could come here...
{68338}{68417}and show me what|I'm definitely not missing?
{68438}{68488}That's not why I came by.
{68488}{68538}How many times|you gonna come over here...
{68538}{68588}begging me|to take you back, huh?
{68588}{68638}I was...
{68649}{68714}Dewey Newcombe?
{68714}{68757}Who's asking?
{68785}{68864}I'm Elle Woods.|Miss Bonifante's attorney.
{68864}{68938}And I'm here to discuss|the legal situation at hand.
{68944}{68978}Come again?
{68989}{69089}Do you understand what|subject matter jurisdiction is?
{69089}{69139}- No.|- I didn't think so.
{69139}{69239}Well, due to habeas corpus...
{69239}{69314}you and Miss Bonifante|had a common law marriage...
{69314}{69389}which heretofore|entitles her...
{69389}{69439}to what is|legally referred to...
{69439}{69514}as equitable division|of the assets.
{69524}{69564}Come again?
{69564}{69664}Due to the fact that you've|retained this residence...
{69664}{69714}Miss Bonifante is entitled...
{69714}{69764}to full canine|property ownership...
{69764}{69869}and will be enforcing|said ownership right now.
{69925}{69972}Tell him, Paulette.
{70115}{70214}I'm taking the dog, dumbass!
{70240}{70287}That's awesome! We did it!
{70390}{70440}Come here.
{70440}{70465}Oh, my gosh, did you see him?
{70465}{70524}He's probably still|scratching his head.
{70524}{70614}Which must be a nice vacation|for his balls.
{70840}{70877}Thank you.
{71016}{71066}According to|Swinney vs. Neubert...
{71066}{71141}Swinney, who was also|a private sperm donor...
{71141}{71216}was allowed visitation rights|as long as he came to terms...
{71216}{71241}with the hours|set forth by the parents.
{71241}{71316}So, if we're sticking|to past precedent...
{71316}{71391}Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.
{71391}{71466}He was clearly within his rights|to ask for visitation.
{71466}{71541}But Swinney was|a one-time sperm donor...
{71541}{71641}and our defendant|was an habitual sperm donor...
{71641}{71716}who also happens to be|harassing the parents...
{71716}{71742}in his quest for visitation.
{71742}{71816}But without this man's sperm...
{71816}{71892}the child in question|wouldn't exist.
{71892}{71949}Now you're|thinking like a lawyer.
{72067}{72108}Yes, Ms. Woods?
{72127}{72192}Although Mr. Huntington|makes an excellent point...
{72192}{72247}I have to wonder|if the defendant...
{72247}{72317}kept a thorough record|of every sperm emission...
{72317}{72359}made throughout his life.
{72417}{72466}Interesting. Why do you ask?
{72469}{72567}Unless the defendant|attempted to contact...
{72567}{72617}every single one-night stand|to determine...
{72617}{72667}if a child resulted|in those unions...
{72667}{72742}he has no parental claim|over this child whatsoever.
{72742}{72818}Why now? Why this sperm?
{72818}{72868}I see your point.
{72868}{72942}And for that matter,|all masturbatory emissions...
{72942}{72993}where his sperm was clearly|not seeking an egg...
{72993}{73068}could be termed|reckless abandonment.
{73088}{73151}I believe|you've just won your case.
{73268}{73313}Ms. Woods, you did well today.
{73325}{73354}Really?
{73371}{73418}You're applying|for my internship, aren't you?
{73437}{73468}I don't know.
{73468}{73520}You should.|Do you have a resume?
{73532}{73576}Yes, I do.
{73683}{73722}Here it is.
{73764}{73792}It's pink.
{73794}{73818}And it's scented.
{73818}{73860}I think it gives|it a little something extra.
{73861}{73892}Don't you think?
{73944}{74001}See you next class.
{74094}{74169}Do you think she woke up|one morning and said...
{74169}{74219}I think I'll go|to law school today.
{74219}{74269}That lapse in judgment aside...
{74269}{74319}I think|she's got a lot of potential.
{74334}{74378}Here's the Windham file.
{74394}{74432}Smell this.
{74496}{74526}What's that?
{74528}{74569}It's her resume.
{74580}{74626}Smells good.
{75245}{75270}What's going on?
{75270}{75334}Callahan's firm|is defending a murder trial.
{75338}{75416}His case load is so big,|he's taking first year interns.
{75418}{75470}He picked them already?
{75470}{75520}My God,|I can't believe it, Warner!
{75526}{75574}We got it!
{75620}{75678}That only leaves one for...
{75815}{75850}Me!
{75870}{75907}Yes!
{76146}{76246}Remember when we spent|those four amazing hours...
{76246}{76296}in the hot tub|after winter formal?
{76296}{76346}Yeah--No.
{76356}{76442}This is so much better|than that!
{76456}{76521}Excuse me.|I have some shopping to do.
{76571}{76618}Four hours?
{77147}{77190}You look very nice today,|Vivian.
{77222}{77256}Thank you.
{77272}{77308}You're welcome.
{77572}{77622}We're defending|Brooke Windham...
{77622}{77672}whose very wealthy husband|was found shot to death...
{77672}{77722}in their Beacon Hill mansion.
{77722}{77748}Gold digger?
{77748}{77798}You'd think so|since the stiff was 60...
{77798}{77848}but she was rich on her own.
{77848}{77898}Some kind of fitness empire.
{77898}{77973}You can buy her exercise tapes|on infomercials.
{77973}{78023}Are you talking about|Brooke Taylor?
{78059}{78123}Maiden name--Taylor.
{78123}{78157}You know her?
{78161}{78198}She's a Delta Nu!
{78198}{78223}She wasn't in my pledge class.
{78223}{78277}She graduated|four years before me.
{78279}{78348}But I used to take her class|at the Los Angeles Sports Club.
{78348}{78398}She's amazing!
{78398}{78448}Amazing? How?
{78448}{78498}She can make you lose|three pounds in one class.
{78498}{78548}She's completely gifted.
{78548}{78623}In all likelihood,|she's completely guilty.
{78623}{78698}She was seen standing over|her husband's dead body.
{78698}{78724}By who?
{78724}{78798}His 26-year-old daughter|and the pool boy.
{78820}{78874}Sorry, I'm late.|Excuse me.
{78886}{78948}This is Emmett Richmond,|another associate...
{78948}{78974}top three in his class...
{78974}{79024}and former editor of|"Harvard Law Review".
{79034}{79074}You've probably seen him...
{79074}{79124}lurking around campus|doing my research.
{79124}{79149}Thanks for the introduction.
{79159}{79224}What about the murder weapon?
{79224}{79249}The gun is missing.
{79249}{79293}The coroner said|he'd been dead 30 minutes...
{79294}{79324}when the cops arrived.
{79324}{79374}Giving Brooke|plenty of time to stash it.
{79374}{79449}I just don't think|Brooke could have done this.
{79449}{79499}Exercise gives you endorphins.
{79499}{79541}Endorphins make you happy.
{79543}{79604}Happy people|don't shoot their husbands.
{79652}{79686}They just don't.
{79699}{79750}I didn't do it.
{79750}{79778}I walked in...
{79780}{79850}I saw my husband|lying on the floor...
{79850}{79914}I bent down to check his heart,|screamed my head off...
{79914}{79954}then Enrique and Chutney|ran inside.
{79954}{80025}OK. Your step-daughter|and the pool boy came in...
{80025}{80075}where they saw you|standing over the body...
{80075}{80129}covered in his blood.
{80160}{80225}Why would I kill my husband?
{80225}{80303}Insurance, a love affair,|pure unadulterated hatred.
{80303}{80372}The D.A. will come up|with plenty of reasons.
{80381}{80422}I loved him.
{80445}{80525}He was 34 years older|than you.
{80525}{80600}That doesn't|look so good to a jury.
{80600}{80650}Then show them|a picture of his dick.
{80656}{80713}That might clear|a few things up.
{80773}{80830}Brooke, I believe you...
{80832}{80906}but a jury|is going to want an alibi.
{80914}{80950}I can't give you that...
{80950}{81051}and if you put me|on the stand, I'll lie.
{81061}{81139}Then I guess|we're done for today.
{81393}{81424}I know you.
{81426}{81499}I'm a Delta Nu,|and I'm a huge fan of yours.
{81516}{81566}You took my class in L.A.
{81576}{81630}You had the best high-kick|I've ever seen.
{81643}{81694}Are you one of my lawyers?
{81701}{81726}Sort of.
{81735}{81802}Well, thank God|one of you has a brain.
{81816}{81850}Let's go.
{81941}{81983}I'm the only one|that believes her.
{81983}{82027}Callahan totally thinks|she's guilty.
{82027}{82102}That's because men are|big fat retards who don't--
{82129}{82168}Afternoon, ladies.
{82183}{82218}It's him.
{82227}{82277}Paulette Bonifante.
{82302}{82340}Oh, my God.
{82402}{82449}He's coming over here.
{82534}{82574}I've got a package.
{82660}{82696}He's got a package.
{83003}{83046}How you doing today?
{83078}{83101}Fine.
{83253}{83297}Take it easy.
{83336}{83364}See you later.
{83403}{83453}That's great, Paulette.
{83453}{83503}Is this the only interaction|you two have ever had?
{83503}{83602}No. Sometimes I say|"OK" instead of "fine".
{83639}{83703}Why don't you offer him|a cold beverage...
{83703}{83754}or a neck massage|or something?
{83760}{83804}What's the point?
{83811}{83878}Trust me, Paulette.|You have all the equipment...
{83878}{83928}you just need|to read the manual.
{83947}{83993}Do you know what I'm saying?
{84014}{84054}OK. I'll show you|a little maneuver...
{84054}{84104}my mother taught me|in junior high.
{84104}{84179}In my experience,|it has a 98% success rate...
{84179}{84204}of getting a man's attention...
{84204}{84254}and when used appropriately...
{84254}{84354}it has an 83% rate of return|on a dinner invitation.
{84354}{84379}Wow!
{84379}{84454}It's called "the bend and snap".
{84454}{84490}Watch this.
{84554}{84629}Oh! I think I dropped|something on the floor.
{84634}{84730}So you bend... and snap!
{84730}{84769}See?
{84780}{84818}Come on. You try it.
{84930}{84998}Bend... and snap!
{85000}{85019}OK...
{85046}{85105}a little less bend,|a little more snap.
{85126}{85148}Like this?
{85172}{85205}Good snap.
{85205}{85250}Come on.
{85268}{85355}You! Come on, you can do it.
{85355}{85424}Bend... and snap.
{85430}{85455}Very, very good.
{85455}{85509}We can all do it!
{85530}{85605}- Come on, guys.|- I can't do that.
{85605}{85655}You're gonna bend...
{85655}{85680}and snap!
{85680}{85705}Now put your head into it.
{85705}{85806}Bend... and snap!
{85806}{85880}Bend... and snap! Good job!
{85880}{85930}A little attitude, please.
{85930}{86006}Now, everybody smile.|That's very important.
{86006}{86081}Pump! Pump! Pump!
{86081}{86131}Bend... and snap!
{86131}{86181}Good job, everybody!
{86181}{86256}Work it out! Work it out!
{86256}{86355}That's it! Wow!
{86381}{86435}Come on, Paulette!
{86456}{86531}Bend and snap!
{86531}{86630}Oh, my God! The bend and snap!|Works every time!
{86656}{86732}If Brooke didn't kill the guy,|then who did?
{86738}{86806}My money is on the angry|daughter or the ex-wife.
{86806}{86856}Chutney has a trust fund.
{86856}{86906}She didn't need the insurance|pay off or the inheritance.
{86906}{86932}What about the mother?
{86932}{86982}Covered.|She was in Aspen at the time.
{86982}{87032}Vivian, get me some plum sauce.
{87032}{87082}Ten people saw her|downing cosmopolitans...
{87082}{87107}at the Caribou Club.
{87107}{87157}All I know is it's not Brooke.
{87161}{87246}That's touching Elle,|but we need an alibi.
{87325}{87357}I brought you|some necessities--
{87357}{87407}some Calvin Klein|720-count sheets...
{87407}{87482}the entire Clinique|skin care line...
{87482}{87581}some aromatherapy candles,|a loofah...
{87607}{87657}And the Bible.
{87682}{87721}You're an angel.
{87736}{87808}So how are you?|Are you all right?
{87808}{87882}You look so... orange.
{87882}{87958}I'm just glad that|it's you and not Callahan.
{87968}{88033}He means well.|He's very brilliant.
{88037}{88093}He better be for what|I'm paying for him.
{88125}{88183}I have to tell you|the real reason I came here.
{88183}{88258}Professor Callahan says|we really, really need your alibi.
{88264}{88357}Elle, I can't.
{88383}{88433}You don't understand.
{88433}{88483}Who could understand|better than me?
{88511}{88558}It's so shameful.
{88575}{88638}Whatever it is, Brooke,|it could save you.
{88638}{88698}No, that's just it.|It would ruin me.
{88705}{88741}How?
{88808}{88884}I've made my fortune|on the ability...
{88884}{88959}to perfect women's bodies with|Brooke's Butt-Buster workout.
{88959}{89018}I know, you helped me|go from a six to a four.
{89018}{89062}That's great!
{89140}{89212}On the day of|Heyworth's murder...
{89330}{89364}I was getting...
{89407}{89440}What?
{89442}{89508}I was getting liposuction.
{89534}{89584}Liposuction!
{89584}{89634}Oh, God!
{89634}{89684}I know! I'm a fraud!
{89684}{89749}It's not like normal women|can have this ass!
{89754}{89795}If my fans|knew that I bought it...
{89795}{89847}I would lose everything!
{89884}{89942}I've already lost my husband.
{90023}{90099}I'd rather go to jail|than lose my reputation.
{90126}{90224}Brooke...|your secret's safe with me.
{90320}{90358}Thank you.
{90410}{90460}Vivian, grab me some coffee.
{90460}{90510}We got two interviews|tomorrow...
{90510}{90535}that Gerard and Bobby|will handle.
{90535}{90585}The ex-wife in an hour.
{90585}{90635}According to this communique|from the prison...
{90635}{90710}our client apparently|had a visit from her sister...
{90752}{90810}a Miss Delta Nu.
{90847}{90890}Anyone you know?
{90892}{90939}Yes. I went to visit her.
{90945}{90996}What the hell do you mean|you went to visit her?
{90996}{91036}I went to get her alibi.
{91036}{91070}Did you get it?
{91075}{91119}It's really good.
{91121}{91186}Great. What is it?
{91186}{91236}Oh, I can't tell you.
{91246}{91286}Why the hell not?
{91286}{91336}Because I promised her|I'd keep it a secret...
{91336}{91386}and I can't break the bonds|of sisterhood.
{91386}{91444}Screw sisterhood!|This is a murder trial...
{91444}{91506}not some scandal|at the sorority house.
{91506}{91540}I want the alibi!
{91549}{91586}I can't give it to you...
{91588}{91661}but I can tell you|she is innocent.
{91669}{91762}Mr. Callahan, Mrs. Windham Vandermark|is on line two for you.
{91762}{91836}Someone reason with her|while I take this.
{91874}{91936}Are you crazy?|Just tell him the alibi.
{91940}{91970}No!
{91959}{92016}We're gonna lose this case|if you don't.
{91994}{92037}Then we're not|very good lawyers.
{92037}{92118}If you tell him, he'll probably|hire you as a summer associate.
{92122}{92202}Who cares about Brooke?|Think about yourself.
{92250}{92298}I gave her my word, Warner.
{92300}{92334}So what?
{92437}{92487}The ex-wife seems|to be unconcerned...
{92487}{92537}with the fact|that her interview is today.
{92537}{92587}She's at a spa|in the Berkshires.
{92587}{92687}A spa? Isn't that|like your mothership?
{92687}{92738}I could go if you want me to.
{92738}{92798}Emmett? Go with her.
{93088}{93154}She seems completely|untrustworthy to me.
{93154}{93188}Why?
{93188}{93238}I mean, this is a person|who's made her living...
{93238}{93288}by telling women|that they're too fat.
{93288}{93363}Brooke would never tell|a woman that she was too fat.
{93363}{93424}And, she seems to me like|she's hiding something.
{93450}{93496}But maybe it's not what you think.
{93486}{93536}Maybe it's exactly what I think.
{93556}{93609}You're really being a butthead.
{93636}{93673}A butthead?
{93671}{93704}Why would you call me that?
{93707}{93764}You know, I mean, you just need to have|a little more faith in people.
{93764}{93809}You might be surprised.
{93849}{93898}I can't believe|you called me a butthead.
{93899}{93989}No one's called me that|since the ninth grade.
{93999}{94056}Maybe not to your face.
{94114}{94176}So this is what a spa|looks like. Wow.
{94176}{94206}How do we find her?
{94210}{94249}I called ahead.|She's in the mud room.
{94249}{94322}She's not naked, is she?
{94389}{94443}Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
{94489}{94539}So you found me.
{94550}{94639}We're from Austen, Platt,|Jaret, and Callahan...
{94639}{94689}and we're here to ask you|a few questions.
{94700}{94775}So I hear that little tart|from California...
{94775}{94819}shot poor Heyworth.
{94822}{94896}That's what we're trying|to prove didn't happen.
{94896}{94948}Do you have any reason|to believe that it did?
{94950}{95015}I've never|actually met the woman...
{95020}{95065}but my daughter tells me...
{95065}{95101}she can be|quite the little bitch.
{95110}{95180}Did your daughter|ever mention anything...
{95180}{95252}about the relationship|between Brooke and Heyworth?
{95254}{95370}She did say that|they humped like gorillas.
{95376}{95465}I guess it wasn't enough,|though,for Brooke.
{95476}{95515}Why do you say that?
{95526}{95550}Well...
{95565}{95634}haven't you seen|the cabana boy?
{95676}{95690}She's lying.
{95690}{95740}And you know this for a fact?
{95740}{95816}Did you see the icky|brown color of her hair?
{95816}{95890}So? Now you discriminate|against brunettes?
{95890}{95966}Why not? I'm discriminated|against as a blonde.
{95966}{96016}You know, being a blonde is actually|a pretty powerful thing.
{96016}{96066}You hold more cards|than you think you do.
{96066}{96141}And I personally would like|to see you take that power...
{96141}{96222}and channel it|towards the greater good.
{96230}{96302}Thanks.|I'll see you tomorrow.
{96302}{96349}All right.
{96396}{96445}How do you think|I'd look as a blonde, you know?
{96457}{96516}I'm not sure|you could handle it.
{96526}{96584}- Good night.|- Bye.
{96816}{96852}So, I called your room|last night.
{96852}{96892}I heard.
{96892}{96942}I was thinking maybe|we could go out sometime.
{96942}{96992}No. You're a dork.
{97020}{97060}I'm in law school.
{97062}{97117}Look, I'm not going out|with you.
{97117}{97167}I can't believe you'd even ask.
{97167}{97242}Girls like me don't go out|with losers like you.
{97250}{97292}Let's get out of here.
{97292}{97328}Excuse me.
{97417}{97467}Why didn't you call me?
{97467}{97492}What?
{97492}{97536}We spent a beautiful|night together...
{97536}{97574}and I never hear from you again?
{97588}{97622}I...
{97663}{97707}I'm sorry?
{97718}{97762}Sorry for what?|For breaking my heart...
{97762}{97792}or for giving me|the greatest pleasure...
{97792}{97887}I've ever known and then|just taking it away?
{97934}{97974}Both?
{97976}{98003}Well, forget it.
{98003}{98068}I've already spent too many hours|crying over you.
{98168}{98242}So... when did|you want to go out?
{98410}{98435}Come in.
{98558}{98618}Are you done with|that deposition yet?
{98618}{98668}Yeah. Here, take it.
{98668}{98715}I've read it 20 times.
{98961}{99064}You know, Elle,|I still can't believe...
{99069}{99119}you didn't tell|Callahan the alibi.
{99138}{99194}It's not my alibi to tell.
{99214}{99236}I know.
{99244}{99348}And I thought|that was very classy of you.
{99392}{99414}Really?
{99436}{99454}Sure.
{99500}{99528}Thanks.
{99705}{99794}Did you ever notice how|Callahan never asks Warner...
{99794}{99839}to bring him his coffee?
{99839}{99920}He's asked me at least|ten times.
{99928}{99984}Men are helpless.|You know that.
{100005}{100070}I know. Warner doesn't|even do his own laundry.
{100070}{100120}He has to have it sent out.
{100120}{100157}I know.
{100225}{100270}Did you know|when he first applied...
{100277}{100324}he got wait-listed.
{100351}{100380}What?
{100415}{100465}His father had to make a call.
{100480}{100512}You're kidding.
{100576}{100612}No way!
{100722}{100808}God, that is|such a precious dog.
{100814}{100852}His name is Bruiser.|Do you want to hold him?
{100883}{100938}- He's very friendly.|- Sure.
{101021}{101075}Look, he likes you.
{101106}{101144}He's giving me kisses.
{101206}{101246}Thanks, Jeoff.
{101256}{101321}We're here today covering|the trial of Brooke Windham.
{101321}{101396}She's charged with|the murder of her husband...
{101396}{101446}Boston millionaire|Heyworth Windham.
{101454}{101546}First to testify are the|victim's daughter and ex-wife.
{101546}{101596}The Superior Court of Suffolk|County is now in session.
{101596}{101671}The Honorable Judge|Marina R. Bickford presiding.
{101671}{101708}You may be seated.
{101924}{101972}And where was she exactly?
{101972}{102037}Standing over|my father's dead body.
{102078}{102127}And what was|the defendant doing?
{102149}{102229}She was sitting|next to the pool, topless...
{102232}{102300}while the Latin boy|handed her a drink.
{102362}{102451}Mr. Salvatore,|can you tell us what this is?
{102498}{102530}My uniform.
{102547}{102597}This is the uniform...
{102597}{102708}Mrs. Windham asked you to wear|while cleaning her pool?
{102833}{102916}Are you having an affair|with Brooke Windham?
{103005}{103042}Define "affair".
{103048}{103134}Have you and Mrs. Windham|had sexual relations?
{103164}{103240}Yes. OK? Yes.
{103352}{103423}Ladies and gentlemen,|court will reconvene...
{103423}{103473}tomorrow morning at 9 A.M.
{103487}{103518}We're adjourned.
{103589}{103673}You know a Delta Nu would never sleep|with a man who wears a thong.
{103673}{103694}Never!
{103694}{103757}I just liked watching|him clean the filter.
{103759}{103807}I believe you, Brooke.
{103809}{103866}- Take care of me, Elle.|- I will.
{104362}{104405}I got a big one for you.
{104581}{104614}Can you sign?
{105525}{105572}I got it.
{105684}{105715}You broke his nose?
{105715}{105750}I blew it, Elle.
{105750}{105802}My snap was|all over the place.
{105807}{105850}I'll be there|as soon as court is out.
{105850}{105895}We have to|cross-examine Enrique.
{105895}{105926}But don't worry.|My girlfriend Serena...
{105926}{105976}barfed on a guy during|"The Blair Witch Project"...
{105976}{106007}and they ended up dating|for three months.
{106007}{106080}Really?|All right. Bye-bye.
{106080}{106118}OK. Bye.
{106395}{106486}Don't stomp your little|last-season Prada shoes at me.
{106526}{106569}These aren't last season.
{106776}{106852}- He's gay! Enrique's gay!|- What?
{106852}{106907}What kind of shoes are these?
{106930}{106960}Black ones.
{106960}{107010}- See!|- What are you talking about?
{107020}{107098}He isn't Brooke's lover.|He's making it up.
{107100}{107152}Back up.|How do you know he's gay?
{107160}{107230}Gay men know designers.|Straight men don't.
{107233}{107260}Know what?
{107262}{107321}He left a Cher tape|in the pool house one time.
{107362}{107438}While I appreciate|your masterful legal theory...
{107438}{107479}I have a murder trial|to attend to.
{107602}{107667}I'll take care of it.|Thanks.
{107694}{107730}The court will come to order.
{107902}{107974}Mr. Salvatore,|do you have any proof...
{107974}{108063}that you and Mrs. Windham|were having an affair?
{108082}{108128}Only the love in my heart.
{108149}{108228}If that's all the proof|that he has, Your Honor...
{108228}{108266}I think I'm done here.
{108287}{108311}You may step down.
{108312}{108372}I'd like to ask a couple|of questions, Your Honor.
{108403}{108454}Just give me a couple minutes.
{108516}{108564}Did you ever take|Mrs. Windham on a date?
{108570}{108619}- Yes.|- Where?
{108620}{108689}A restaurant where|no one could recognize us.
{108689}{108739}How long have you been|sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
{108739}{108764}Three months.
{108764}{108831}- And your boyfriend's name is...|- Chuck.
{108954}{108979}Silence!
{108979}{109014}Pardon me!
{109014}{109039}Yes, Mr. Salvatore?
{109039}{109093}I was confused.
{109093}{109169}I thought you said friend.|Chuck is just a friend.
{109179}{109229}You bitch!
{109229}{109279}Chuck, wait!
{109289}{109378}Silence in my court!|Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.
{109438}{109504}Silence in my courtroom!
{109504}{109579}How did I miss that?|You were great.
{109595}{109636}Silence in my courtroom!
{109684}{109716}Thanks.
{109815}{109872}- Good night.|- Good night.
{109961}{110040}Oh, Elle, Callahan asked to see you|before you leave.
{110040}{110059}Really?
{110059}{110140}Yeah, you know, he already had his coffee,|but maybe he needs a doughnut.
{110140}{110205}- Do you need any help?|- No. I'm fine.
{110205}{110245}OK. Bye.
{110355}{110397}Come on in.
{110482}{110518}Sit down.
{110726}{110757}Is everything all right?
{110770}{110831}You followed|your intuition today...
{110831}{110893}and you were right on target.
{110926}{110976}I should have listened.
{110981}{111006}Thank you.
{111056}{111096}About the alibi...
{111102}{111120}I'm sorry--
{111120}{111181}I'm impressed that you took|the initiative to go get it.
{111188}{111231}That's what makes a good lawyer.
{111245}{111308}And on top of that,|you gained the client's trust...
{111309}{111381}and kept it -- that's what|makes a great lawyer.
{111401}{111452}You're smart, Elle.
{111466}{111514}Smarter than most of|the guys on my payroll.
{111529}{111571}Wow.
{111594}{111667}I think it's time|to discuss your career path.
{111667}{111756}Have you thought about where|you might be a summer associate?
{111781}{111831}Not really.
{111840}{111881}I know it's very competitive.
{111887}{111971}You know what competition's|really about?
{112005}{112100}It's about ferocity, carnage.
{112111}{112238}Balancing human intelligence|with animal diligence.
{112257}{112332}Knowing exactly what you want...
{112332}{112432}and how far you'll go|to get it.
{112432}{112495}How far will Elle go?
{112607}{112634}Are you hitting on me?
{112643}{112686}You're a beautiful girl.
{112718}{112762}So everything you just said...
{112762}{112807}I'm a man|who knows what he wants.
{112850}{112882}And I'm a law student|who just realized...
{112882}{112941}her professor|is a pathetic asshole.
{112983}{113033}Too bad. I thought|you were a law student...
{113033}{113080}who wanted to be a lawyer!
{113494}{113538}You almost had me fooled.
{113549}{113583}What?
{113588}{113638}Maybe you should sleep|with the jury, too.
{113638}{113686}Then we can win the case.
{114105}{114140}I'm quitting.
{114144}{114169}Why?
{114169}{114244}Law school was a mistake.|This whole internship was a mistake.
{114244}{114294}What are you talking about?|You earned it.
{114294}{114351}I didn't earn anything, Emmett.
{114366}{114409}Callahan only gave me|that internship...
{114409}{114445}because he liked the way|I looked.
{114450}{114516}Which he made clear tonight|when he tried to feel me up.
{114552}{114598}Callahan did what?
{114634}{114695}Just forget about it.|I'm going back to L.A.
{114695}{114760}No more boring suits.|No more pantyhose.
{114762}{114816}No more trying to be|something that I'm just--
{114841}{114879}I'm just not.
{114891}{114960}What if you're trying|to be somebody you are?
{114985}{115035}The hell with Callahan.
{115104}{115138}Stay.
{115216}{115278}Call me if you're ever|in California.
{115710}{115760}What's the point in staying,|Paulette?
{115760}{115836}All people see|when they look at me...
{115836}{115886}is blond hair and big boobs.
{115892}{115946}No one's ever gonna|take me seriously.
{115946}{116036}The people at law school don't.|Warner doesn't.
{116046}{116135}I don't think my own parents|take me seriously.
{116187}{116261}I just felt, like,|for the first time...
{116261}{116330}that someone expected me to...
{116343}{116386}to do something more|with my life...
{116386}{116470}than become|a Victoria's Secret model.
{116523}{116574}But I was just kidding myself.
{116586}{116622}Callahan never saw me|as a lawyer...
{116622}{116661}just as a piece of ass.
{116672}{116716}Just like everybody else.
{116792}{116838}Turns out I am a joke.
{116869}{116936}No, you're not a joke.
{117137}{117187}The hell with law school.
{117187}{117262}I just wanted to say good-bye.
{117272}{117383}If you're going to let one|stupid prick ruin your life...
{117528}{117606}you're not the girl|I thought you were.
{118025}{118098}Did you go in there knowing how|to discredit Mr. Salvatore?
{118098}{118125}Absolutely.
{118125}{118223}It's a little thing|I'd like to call strategy.
{118223}{118313}You know, I had a feeling|about Mr. Salvatore...
{118313}{118348}Is he always such an ass?
{118348}{118398}He's the top defense|attorney in the state.
{118398}{118430}Of course he's an ass.
{118431}{118509}Fine. Is he an ass|that's gonna win my case?
{118512}{118563}No, he's an ass that's gonna try.
{118564}{118609}He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
{118609}{118650}That's not what's important.
{118650}{118719}If he doesn't trust me,|why should I trust him?
{118720}{118801}Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy|with him last night.
{118812}{118891}You don't know what the hell|you're talking about.
{118924}{118964}What's going on here?
{118984}{119044}- Elle quit.|- What?
{119045}{119114}Callahan hit on her,|so she quit.
{119120}{119214}My God. Scumbag.
{119219}{119276}- Oh, God.|- What?
{119306}{119415}I feel terrible.|I made a huge mistake.
{119569}{119643}Well, maybe there's something|we can do about it.
{119750}{119786}Thank you.
{119895}{119975}What are you so happy about?|You're on trial for murder.
{119975}{120015}Get up.
{120050}{120075}What?
{120075}{120142}You're fired.|I have new representation.
{120188}{120207}Who?
{120782}{120819}Excuse you,|you're in my way.
{120819}{120890}She's a law student.|She can't defend you.
{120897}{121012}Massachusetts Supreme|Judicial Court ruling 3.03.
{121016}{121091}See? Thank you, David.
{121095}{121162}Counselors,|approach the bench.
{121178}{121241}- You're not going up there.|- Yes, I am.
{121246}{121316}I'm sorry, maybe you didn't hear me.|You're fired.
{121322}{121415}Counselors, now.|All of you.
{121520}{121559}Elle Woods, Your Honor.
{121560}{121616}Rule 3.03 of|Supreme Judicial Court...
{121616}{121666}states that a law student|may appear on behalf...
{121666}{121716}of a defendant|in criminal proceedings.
{121737}{121777}Your Honor,|I have no problem with this.
{121777}{121825}I do.|I'm not allowing it.
{121825}{121892}But you agreed last night.|In your office...
{121892}{121942}when we were discussing|my career.
{121957}{121997}The ruling also states...
{121997}{122092}that you need a licensed|attorney to supervise you.
{122092}{122167}- Mr. Callahan?|- That I won't agree to.
{122177}{122242}I'll supervise, Your Honor.
{122252}{122317}Well, Ms. Woods, proceed.
{122328}{122364}Thank you, Your Honor.
{122729}{122772}Enjoy prison.
{122793}{122893}Mrs. Windham, you do realize|what you're doing?
{122893}{122940}Absolutely.
{122993}{123020}Oh, my God! There she is!
{123020}{123118}Elle! Elle, we came to see your trial!
{123118}{123193}Oh look how cute.|There's like a judge and everything.
{123193}{123293}- And jury people.|- Vote for Elle!
{123293}{123328}Ladies, take a seat.
{123334}{123365}Go, girl.
{123504}{123543}Do you swear to tell|the truth, the whole truth...
{123543}{123590}and nothing but the truth,|so help you God?
{123590}{123637}- I do.|- Be seated.
{123681}{123757}Ms. Woods, you may begin|your questioning.
{123879}{123919}First of all|I would like to point out...
{123919}{123994}that not only is there|no proof in this case...
{123994}{124094}but there is a complete|lack of mens rea...
{124094}{124213}which by definition tells us|there can be no crime...
{124224}{124265}without a vicious will.
{124277}{124344}I am aware of the meaning|of mens rea.
{124344}{124380}What I'm unaware of...
{124380}{124444}is why you're giving me|a vocabulary lesson...
{124445}{124494}when you should be|questioning your witness.
{124494}{124523}when you should be|questioning your witness.
{124550}{124591}Yes, Your Honor.
{124682}{124707}Miss Windham...
{124728}{124783}when you arrived|back at the house...
{124812}{124850}was your father there?
{124862}{124913}Not that I saw,|but like I said...
{124913}{124970}I went straight upstairs|to take a shower.
{125001}{125116}And when you came downstairs,|what happened?
{125130}{125198}I saw Brooke|standing over his body...
{125218}{125273}drenched in his blood.
{125411}{125481}But Mrs. Windham|didn't have a gun?
{125485}{125543}No. She'd stashed it|by then.
{125544}{125585}Move to strike that|from the record, Your Honor.
{125585}{125637}- It's speculation.|- So stricken.
{125691}{125735}Go ahead.
{125856}{125937}Miss Windham,|did you hear a shot fired?
{125940}{126009}No. I was in the shower.
{126062}{126149}So, sometime|in the 20 minutes...
{126153}{126250}that you were in the shower,|your father was shot.
{126264}{126292}I guess.
{126321}{126381}Your father was shot|while you were in the shower...
{126400}{126495}but you didn't hear|the shot because...
{126588}{126634}because you were in the shower?
{126671}{126763}I was washing my hair.
{126826}{126872}Where is she going with this?
{126872}{126926}Have a little faith, Gerard.
{127138}{127172}Miss Windham...
{127177}{127230}what had you done|earlier that day?
{127252}{127297}I got up...
{127297}{127354}got a latte,|went to the gym...
{127354}{127410}got a perm, and came home.
{127456}{127501}Where you got in the shower?
{127536}{127585}I believe the witness|has made it clear...
{127585}{127652}that she was in the shower.
{127791}{127833}Yes, Your Honor.
{127841}{127937}Miss Windham, had you|ever gotten a perm before?
{127948}{128019}- Yes.|- How many would you say?
{128036}{128105}Two a year since I was 12.
{128119}{128162}You do the math.
{128176}{128257}You know, a girl in my sorority,|Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.
{128266}{128304}We all tried|to talk her out of it.
{128304}{128352}Curls weren't|a good look for her.
{128356}{128413}She didn't have|your bone structure.
{128442}{128478}But, thankfully,|that same day...
{128478}{128538}she entered the Beta Delta Pi|wet t-shirt contest...
{128538}{128598}where she was completely|hosed down from head to toe.
{128598}{128684}Objection!|Why is this relevant?
{128684}{128714}I have a point, I promise.
{128714}{128759}Then make it.
{128759}{128790}Yes, ma'am.
{128819}{128898}Chutney, why were|Tracy Marcinko's curls ruined...
{128898}{128942}when she got hosed down?
{128960}{128999}Because they got wet?
{128999}{129049}Exactly. Because isn't it|the first cardinal rule...
{129049}{129099}of perm maintenance that you're|forbidden to wet your hair...
{129099}{129155}for at least 24 hours|after getting a perm...
{129155}{129248}at the risk of deactivating|the ammonium thioglycolate?
{129299}{129349}And wouldn't somebody|who's had, say, 30 perms...
{129349}{129434}in their life|be well aware of this rule?
{129441}{129499}And if in fact|you weren't washing your hair...
{129503}{129557}as I suspect, because|your curls are still intact...
{129557}{129599}wouldn't you have heard|the gunshot?
{129599}{129649}And if in fact|you had heard the gunshot...
{129649}{129721}Brooke Windham wouldn't have|had time to hide the gun...
{129721}{129750}before you got downstairs...
{129750}{129800}which would mean you would|have had to have found...
{129800}{129845}Mrs. Windham|with a gun in her hand...
{129845}{129915}to make your story plausible.|Isn't that right?
{129920}{129975}She's my age!|Did she tell you that?
{129975}{130035}How would you feel if your|father married someone who was your age?
{130035}{130100}You, however, had time to hide the gun,|didn't you Chutney,
{130100}{130135}after you shot your father.
{130135}{130171}I didn't mean to shoot him.
{130171}{130249}I thought it was you|walking through the door!
{130300}{130350}Order! Order!
{130376}{130403}Order!
{130424}{130458}Oh, my God.
{130466}{130493}Oh, my God.
{130497}{130541}Oh, my God.
{130581}{130636}Bailiff,|take the witness into custody...
{130636}{130726}where she will be charged for|the murder of Heyworth Windham.
{130726}{130800}In the matter of|The State vs. Brooke Windham...
{130811}{130859}this case is dismissed.
{130861}{130919}Mrs. Windham,|you are free to go.
{131190}{131222}Thank you!
{131226}{131253}Thank you!
{131347}{131400}Elle, how did you know|Chutney was lying?
{131400}{131429}Because she's brilliant,|of course.
{131429}{131486}The rules of hair care|are simple and finite.
{131486}{131538}Any Cosmo Girl|would have known.
{131602}{131651}Elle, Elle!
{131676}{131701}What?
{131712}{131752}I just wanted to say...
{131762}{131818}that you were|so brilliant in there.
{131828}{131902}And that I was wrong.
{131918}{132032}And you are the girl for me.
{132044}{132092}- Really?|- Yes.
{132106}{132197}Pooh bear... I love you.
{132273}{132352}I've waited so long|to hear you say that.
{132388}{132462}But if I'm gonna be a partner at|a law firm by the time I'm 30...
{132462}{132551}I need a boyfriend who's not|such a complete bonehead.
{132658}{132697}Thank you, boys.
{132852}{132893}Ladies and gentlemen...
{132898}{132978}I present the graduates|of Harvard Law School...
{133000}{133046}Class of 2004.
{133055}{133103}[ Two years later ]
{133112}{133194}I am personally|very honored to introduce...
{133194}{133263}this year's|class-elected speaker.
{133270}{133353}After getting off|to a quite interesting start...
{133353}{133385}here at Harvard...
{133385}{133478}she graduates today|with an invitation to join...
{133478}{133564}one of Boston's|most prestigious law firms.
{133575}{133684}I am sure we are going to see|great things from her.
{133696}{133794}Ladies and gentlemen,|Elle Woods.
{134325}{134375}On our very first day|at Harvard...
{134375}{134454}a very wise professor|quoted Aristotle.
{134470}{134544}"The law is reason|free from passion."
{134597}{134640}Well, no offense|to Aristotle...
{134640}{134690}but in my three years|at Harvard...
{134690}{134765}I have come to find that passion|is a key ingredient...
{134765}{134885}to the study and practice|of law, and of life.
{134900}{134965}It is with passion,|courage of conviction...
{134965}{135008}and strong sense of self...
{135008}{135080}that we take our next steps|into the world...
{135089}{135140}remembering|that first impressions...
{135140}{135180}are not always correct...
{135216}{135272}you must always have faith|in people...
{135300}{135342}and most importantly...
{135416}{135484}you must always have faith|in yourself.
{135530}{135603}Congratulations, Class of 2004.
{135626}{135660}We did it!
{136209}{136336}Vivian dumped Warner.|She and Elle are now best friends.
{136344}{136485}Warner graduated without honors,|without a girlfriend and without|any job offers.
{136496}{136653}Paulette married the UPS guy.|They are expecting their first child,|a daughter to be named Elle.
{136673}{136752}Emmett quit Callahan's firm and opened|his own practice.
{136763}{136848}He and Elle have been|dating for the past two years.
{137512}{137564}Emmett is proposing to Elle
{137564}{137627}Emmett is proposing to Elle|tonight.
