1
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:29,505
My job takes me to a lot
of places. lt's got its downsides.

2
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,175
I sleep alone. l eat alone.

3
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,469
l'm used to it, though.

4
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,847
I'd like to meet someone...

5
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,518
...but it's tough
when you live out of a suitcase.

6
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,898
l go where I'm told, do what l'm told.

7
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,608
I shouldn't complain.

8
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,529
The work is steady.
The money's good.

9
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,948
But it's not for everyone.

10
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,193
My name's Joe.

11
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,365
This is what l do.

12
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,081
You're late.

13
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,545
Sorry, Mr. London.
They closed Svatopluk Bridge.

14
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,264
You are leaving?

15
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,726
I need the phone.

16
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,489
I can help with the bags.

17
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,408
No, I can handle it.

18
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,252
If you ever come back,
I can use the money.

19
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,964
Goodbye.

20
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,444
I was taught four rules.

21
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,490
One: Don't ask questions.

22
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,785
There is no such thing
as right and wrong.

23
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:56,373
Two: Don't take an interest in people
outside of work.

24
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,917
There is no such thing as trust.

25
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,337
Three: Erase every trace.

26
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,340
Come anonymous
and leave nothing behind.

27
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,886
Four: Know when to get out.

28
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,014
Just thinking about it means it's time.

29
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,520
Before you lose your edge,
before you become a target.

30
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,748
So you look for the right opportunity.

31
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,209
Nothing too risky.

32
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,212
Get the money and disappear foever.

33
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,716
This is it.

34
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,594
Four hits, one location.

35
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,721
The last job.

36
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,851
Purpose of your visit
to Bangkok, Mr. Vincent?

37
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,686
Holiday.

38
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:14,242
Bangkok. lt's corrupt, dirty and dense.

39
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,606
All my clients have one thing
in common:

40
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,108
They feed off the people.

41
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,612
There's big money in misery.

42
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,282
Where there's money,
there's competition.

43
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,202
And the guy paying me usually wins.

44
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,662
lt always starts the same way,
just like l was taught.

45
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,706
Secure a safe location...

46
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,376
...somewhere off the beaten path,
where you have privacy.

47
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,253
But you stay invisible too long...

48
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,965
...the human race
starts to look like another species.

49
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,093
So you ventue out. You observe.

50
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,430
And then you return
to your invisible world...

51
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,515
...like a ghost.

52
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,905
 Hey, Larry?
-Yeah?

53
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,365
Jesus.

54
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,701
Hi.

55
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,704
-Look at these girls.
-Yeah, what's up?

56
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,372
Hello, gentlemen. How are you?

57
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,915
-First time in Bangkok?
-Yep.

58
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,044
Rolex? Good Rolex, you want?
Yeah, yeah. Look, look, good Rolex.

59
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,130
Watch out, Larry. How much
you wanna bet it's counterfeit?

60
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,549
-Two thousand. Look good.
-No, thanks. No, thanks.

61
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,427
No, no Rolex. Never mind,
never mind. You want girls?

62
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,346
-l can get you girl.
MAN 1 : No.

63
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,847
No girl? How about boys?

64
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,223
-You like boys?
-Oh, no.

65
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,476
You don't like boys, huh?

66
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,561
Hey, how about you, huh, cowboy?

67
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,271
One thousand buy new-car smell...

68
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,399
...satisfaction, money-back,
super-wrapper-pussy guarantee, huh?

69
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,943
Whatever happens in Bangkok
stays in Bangkok.

70
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,113
Wanna find garbage?
Go to a garbage dump.

71
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,407
I look for three qualifications:

72
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:04,037
They have to speak a little English,
they have to wanna make money...

73
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,956
...and above all,
they have to be disposable.

74
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,213
Do you wanna make some money?

75
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,925
I have work in town. I need some help.

76
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,802
What work?

77
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:23,473
Pick things up, drop things off.
Maybe some translation.

78
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,435
About a month's work, 2000 a day.

79
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,316
-Dollar?
-Baht.

80
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,236
Bullshit. Eh.

81
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,870
Five thousand, huh?
Forty-five hundred.

82
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,873
Four thousand.

83
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,252
Two thousand nine hundred
and fifty-two fifty, huh?

84
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,170
What do you say? Come on.

85
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,800
We'll round up. Three thousand.
You get paid at the end of the week.

86
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,468
No deal.

87
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,014
Okay, okay. How about half? Half now,
half at the end of the week, huh?

88
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,812
-What's your name?
-Kong.

89
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,772
Kong?

90
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,196
You can keep that
in the wallet you stole.

91
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,535
Be at 21 Samahan Road tomorrow,
7 p. m.

92
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,122
You come alone or you don't get paid.

93
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,332
Yes, boss.

94
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,204
Take off the shades.

95
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,830
Eh?

96
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,999
Glasses. Off.

97
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,425
Keep that with you at all times.

98
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,012
-l have good phone.
-Now you have two.

99
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,848
You answer whenever it rings.

100
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:33,353
If l call and you don't answer,
you don't get paid.

101
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,735
Time is very important.

102
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:46,950
If l tell you to be somewhere
and you are a minute late...

103
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,703
...you don't get paid.

104
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,288
You understand?

105
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,250
-ln English.
-I understand.

106
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,088
-You know the Caribbean Club?
-High-class ass.

107
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,758
Ask for a dancer named Aom.
You give her this.

108
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,261
Make sure the X is facing up like this.

109
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,598
She's gonna give you a package.
Don't open it.

110
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,601
-What's in it?
-lt doesn't concern you.

111
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,270
Then you go pick it up.

112
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:21,025
-l'll find someone else.
-Okay, okay, okay. l do it, l do it, I do it.

113
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,821
Come straight back here.

114
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,575
-You don't stop for anything.
-What if l have to piss?

115
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,660
Huh?

116
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,122
If you ask me one more question--

117
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,917
Then I won't get paid. l know that.

118
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,839
-Okay, I go now, huh?
-Hey.

119
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,633
Take the cell phone.

120
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,796
-You're late, huh?
-Give me the case.

121
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,676
You don't get paid for today.

122
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,303
-Why not?
-Ran from the police.

123
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,431
You told me not to stop.
I do what you say.

124
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,059
"Don't stop. No stop for nothing,
not even for piss."

125
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,311
From now on,
I don't want any more police.

126
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,980
You understand?

127
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:26,270
The human face can mislead
in a thousand different ways.

128
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,065
But the eyes never change.

129
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,528
l was taught to start with the eyes.

130
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,935
I'm Kong.

131
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,466
Wait, wait, wait.

132
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,305
The elephant.

133
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,310
No, the nose.
You see, pointing down?

134
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,021
Bad luck. No good.

135
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,523
Bad luck for you.

136
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,775
Good night.

137
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,089
I'm checking on a wire transfer.

138
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:51,137
Account code: 6514346.

139
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,685
Thank you.

140
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,475
Hello.

141
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:43,063
I have a cut,
and l need some medicine.

142
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,607
Disinfectant.

143
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,568
Do you speak English?

144
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,783
How many?

145
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,746
Um, one.

146
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,797
In the morning? ln the morning.

147
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,383
One.

148
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,135
Before bed.

149
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,568
Two hundred and fifty baht, sir.

150
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,035
-Thank you.
-Oh.

151
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,759
Oh, l have it.

152
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,673
-You're late.
- Sorry, boss.

153
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,968
Don't be sorry, be on time.

154
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,137
What happened to your face?

155
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,017
Some asshole tried to mug me.

156
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,144
Like 20 of them.

157
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,522
But I kicked their asses.

158
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,445
I'm so sorry, boss.

159
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,906
So sorry.

160
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,699
They take--

161
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,245
It's been opened.

162
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,041
Not me. It's them. They broke it.

163
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,252
But I won't let them have it.
I got it back for you.

164
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,882
I don't let them have it.

165
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,720
There's a beer in the refrigerator.

166
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,097
It'll take down the swelling.

167
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,016
Yes, boss.

168
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,398
He's a bad man.

169
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,400
Who?

170
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,029
The man in the case.
You're going to kill him?

171
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,122
- Can you teach me?
-Teach you what?

172
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,958
Everything.

173
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,086
I can help you.

174
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,226
Please?

175
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,564
Show me.

176
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,658
Again.

177
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,755
Good.

178
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,519
That was your first lesson.

179
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,904
Why didn't l kill him?

180
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,033
Maybe it's because...

181
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,036
...and this is strange...

182
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,456
...somehow,
when I looked into his eyes...

183
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,793
...I saw myself.

184
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,380
So l became his teacher.

185
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:51,385
Best way to defend yourself is to know
when something's about to happen.

186
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,763
So you have to learn
to read your surroundings.

187
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,349
See that man in the red jacket?

188
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,854
What man?

189
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,240
You're living in a city of mirrors.

190
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,995
Store windows, glass office buildings,
polished steel.

191
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,247
Eyes in the back of your head.

192
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,793
Ah.

193
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,757
Eyes at the back of my head,
huh, boss? l got you now, boss.

194
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,011
I'm not your boss. I'm your teacher.

195
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,304
So l call you aajaan, then.

196
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,151
-Like this?
-Yeah.

197
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,487
How is he bad?

198
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,281
This man?

199
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,658
He hurts many country girls.

200
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,243
From the north.

201
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,289
He buy them from their parents
and sell them.

202
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,833
Young girls, man.

203
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,671
Same like devil, huh, this guy?

204
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,860
How many people have you killed?

205
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,655
I don't think about that.

206
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,033
Do the police know who you are?

207
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,373
No one knows who l am.
No one knows where I am.

208
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,502
I know.

209
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,343
-How many jobs in Bangkok?
- Four.

210
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,762
Four.

211
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,348
Two left, huh?

212
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,887
Uh....

213
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,057
Um, I....

214
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,146
Um....
Can you help me?

215
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:04,317
Could you tell her
that I wanna take her to dinner?

216
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,028
Oh, right.

217
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,909
It's, uh, hot.

218
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,393
That's just....

219
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,196
Just eat it?

220
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,368
It's cooling it down.

221
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,726
It's hot again. lt's really hot.

222
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,274
Oh, the whole thing.

223
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,655
Yeah, that's better.

224
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,034
Oh.

225
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,885
No, you don't pull the trigger.

226
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,845
Squeeze it.

227
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,684
-lt's yours.
-What?

228
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,061
Congratulations.

229
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,727
Hey, ah.

230
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,954
Ah.

231
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,976
What--? Where--?

232
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,647
Okay.

233
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,515
 Boss.
-Yeah?

234
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:13,519
I just left the club.
I think somebody's following me.

235
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,982
Be at the Chao Phraya ferry station
in 20 minutes.

236
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,318
-Okay, boss.
-Wait for my call.

237
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,861
Done, boss.

238
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:30,036
Okay, listen carefully.
Open the case. Sixty-five, 32, 1 5.

239
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,538
Put the cell phone in the case
and leave it.

240
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,923
The case has returned.

241
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,738
-Yes.
Put your boss on.

242
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,544
-Yes.
-We had an arrangement.

243
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,506
If I see your people again,
I'll kill your wife.

244
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,267
We'll try again.

245
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,124
You, what is your work?

246
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,293
Oh, uh....

247
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,546
Banking.

248
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,882
Ba-- Banker.

249
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,051
-Banker. Yes.
Banker. Banker.

250
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,023
Rain.

251
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,946
Rain...

252
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,326
...is you? Your name means "rain"?

253
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,749
This is your name.

254
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,682
-Bad man?
-Bad for somebody.

255
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,394
Floating market?
Where's Damnoen Saduak?

256
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,564
Ratchaburi province.
Hour and a half by car.

257
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,114
Get some sleep.

258
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,992
We leave early.

259
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,640
Dock the boat up on the right.

260
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,486
Hey, mister, you buy something?
Buy something?

261
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,295
Get us out of here. Get us out.

262
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,801
Dock the boat on the left.

263
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,305
Come on, faster. Hurry up.

264
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,087
Get me over there.

265
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,882
Fuck!

266
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,044
No. No.

267
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,355
Take it to the club.

268
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,899
He same like you, you know.

269
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,569
-Who?
-This guy on TV.

270
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,616
He fight bad guys and helps the poor.

271
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,661
Thai people love him.

272
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,124
He's a very good man.

273
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,669
Same like you, aajaan.

274
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:24,002
Four: Know when it's time to get out.

275
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,348
Three: Erase every trace.

276
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,103
Boss.

277
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:47,859
Two: Don't take an interest in people
outside of work.

278
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,584
One: Don't ask questions.

279
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,548
He's a very good man.

280
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,510
Same like you.

281
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,733
Political assassination
wasn't in the contract...

282
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,193
...so there are two ways to go:

283
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,529
Refuse the job and walk away now...

284
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,117
...or do the job and walk away rich.

285
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:26,541
The truth is almost anyone
can take out a politician.

286
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,710
That's not the hard part.

287
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,297
The hard part is getting away with it.

288
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,231
Kong.

289
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,821
Be here tomorrow at 6 p. m.

290
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:23,867
Last job?

291
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,411
-Yeah.
-Bad man?

292
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,746
Bad for somebody.

293
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,541
See you tomorrow, boss.

294
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,628
Talk.

295
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,774
Aom?

296
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,161
Kong!

297
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,438
Aom!

298
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,782
He fight bad guys and helps the poor.

299
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:18,202
Thai people love him.

300
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,353
 When the nightmare
becomes real, you don't hesitate...

301
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,356
...you don't think, you just run.

302
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,024
Anyone in the way goes down.

303
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,486
lt's pretty simple:
You're the target now.

304
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:42,073
Leave the country
or you're going to die.

305
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:26,677
Why the fuck you care?

306
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,346
He's my student.

307
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:46,113
 --exactly which direction
anybody's running...

308
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,200
...but they seem to be running away
from any possible danger.

309
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,671
Kong.

310
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:43,108
I had to tell them.

311
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:53,076
Take her to the street.

312
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:54,453
I cleared a way.

313
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:57,080
I got one more job.

314
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:58,373
Surat?

315
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,126
He's very bad.
