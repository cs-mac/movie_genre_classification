1
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,760
Put it in fire to get bigger.
They like fire.

2
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,040
It would be better if we were
eating than sitting next to the fire.

3
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,280
- Reminds of me the Black Sea.
- It doesn’t smell that much.

4
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,400
They told me not to go to Egypt.

5
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,160
I don’t feel safe here.

6
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,040
They came from Egypt.
I sold them all. Fifty.

7
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,680
Why is it so cold at Sinai?

8
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,000
Its southern than
USSR.

9
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I'll sell her too.

10
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,120
They came from Cairo or Port Said.

11
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,960
Look at this girl.
She's very pretty.

12
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,840
Silence, they're talking about us.

13
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,360
Give me a cigarette.

14
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,120
She's a doll.
She worth 2 thousand.

15
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,040
She worth 13,000.
Maybe more.

16
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,240
Like my father used to say...

17
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,480
"'Whoever doesn’t open the scene?
Is at the worst situation. "

18
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,640
1.000 pounds. And she
worth 7.000.

19
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:14,440
She's a doll. She's freezing.
You want me to warm her up?

20
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,760
Its cloudy.
Its going to rain soon.

21
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,760
Do they think they're on vacation?
Its cold here.

22
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,520
We are still far away
from the Israel borders.

23
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,000
The last time the
soldiers didn't bother.

24
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,400
Egyptians or Israelis?

25
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,400
Bring more woods.

26
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,160
At the airport they said I am
going to a 5 star hotel.

27
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,360
We are here for generations
with our camels.

28
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,640
Desert is our home.

29
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,560
The others were just
passing by.

30
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,640
Firstly the Turks came,
then the English...

31
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,880
Egyptians and Israelis.
But we were here always.

32
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,800
What’s happening? Are we
going to stay here all night?

33
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,160
If God wants, in two days
we're going to be in Israel.

34
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,240
- Pick her up.
- There is barbed wire.

35
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,480
Throw the bags.

36
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,720
Come and get it/her?

37
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Lets go Igor!

38
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,720
- They are not Bedouins.
- At least they look like Europeans.

39
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,120
Come on! Move!

40
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,800
Come!

41
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,320
I think they're stopping.

42
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,400
Who are those disgusting people?

43
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,240
They're doing circles.
I don’t like that.

44
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,720
I don’t like lights.

45
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,120
- What’s happening;
- Don't start.

46
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,720
- What they want?
- Don't start!

47
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,120
- What are they?
- They are Russians.

48
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,120
At least they are not Bedouins.

49
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,800
Look at these guys.

50
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:34,560
Scumbags, bastards.

51
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,320
- I'll kill them.
- Chill out...

52
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,760
Girls, come out!
Hurry up, bitches.

53
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,880
Come here.
Fast.

54
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:08,480
Come on sweetie. Get out.
You too. Stand here.

55
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,800
Move it, dolls.
Move.

56
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,960
Stand in a line.
Stand there!

57
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,400
So, the first one.
What you think about her?

58
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Three is not enough for her.
She's beautiful and young.

59
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,800
- 4,5. How much;
- Five.

60
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,800
- 5,5.
- What did he say? 5,5 for him.

61
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,200
Next.
Get the kerchief off.

62
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,000
She got short blonde hair.

63
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,280
Five. Six.
What you think?

64
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,400
- 6,5.
- How much are you giving. All right seven

65
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,000
Look at her breast. Its
beautiful. She's smiling.

66
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,760
Seven thousand? All right seven.
Put her in the truck.

67
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,320
- Next. Where are the others?
- The redhead.

68
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,640
- Red hair, short, nice.
- I want to see her first.

69
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,160
Nice breast, cute.
Seven thousand. How much?

70
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,040
How much are you giving?
Where is the other buyer;

71
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,800
- How much you giving?
- One moment.

72
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,600
Did you say five;
7.500, all right.

73
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,520
Alla, next.

74
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,200
Long hair, very small...
She's a doll.

75
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,840
We'll take her.

76
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,880
Next. Redhead.
She's a bit wild...

77
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
How much are you giving?

78
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,240
That's her. How much are you giving?
Four?

79
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,840
- How much are you giving?
- 6 thousand.

80
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,560
Nice ass. Obedient.
Look how nice she is.

81
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,080
7... 7,5 thousand
and I’ll take her now.

82
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,920
- Eight thousand?
- I give eight.

83
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,800
All right, take her.

84
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,560
Where are the other girls?

85
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,720
Tall, slim, dancer.
She’s a dancer.

86
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:39,440
- I'll take her with 5 thousand.
- He's giving 5.

87
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,240
6... How much are you giving?
Where is the other one?

88
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,320
- I'll give 6,5 immediately
- Seven!

89
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,120
- 7!
- 7,5 thousand!

90
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,120
Don’t hurt her!

91
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,800
How much?
All right, eight for her.

92
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,040
She’s experienced
The most experienced.

93
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,960
8,5! 8,5 thousand!

94
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,760
She's the most experienced.
Obedient. Nice ass!

95
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,080
- How much;
- 8,5.

96
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,880
- Curly haired, blonde.
- Let me go!

97
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
Don’t hurt her.

98
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,520
- Six thousand. How much are you giving?
- I give six.

99
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,520
Forget her.
We'll take her.

100
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,360
Is there another one?
That’s all?

101
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,800
No, look at her.
Village girl.

102
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,240
- I give seven for her.
- Virgin.

103
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,880
She's the youngest.
Don't push me.

104
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,720
Nine thousand?
Ten?

105
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,840
How much are you giving for the other one?

106
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,200
Twelve.
How much did you say?

107
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,640
- She’s virgin! Young, beautiful...
- I give thirteen.

108
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,760
- He said twelve already.
- You're giving too much.

109
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:59,280
All right, fifteen.
We're done.

110
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,160
Are we done? All right.

111
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,280
Step away.

112
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,480
Heat does me good.

113
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Luckily we completed the
delivery successfully.

114
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,360
In two-three days we're going
to have another delivery.

115
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,920
- This was the last one.
- You think so?

116
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,440
Where is the driver going us?

117
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,840
Kristina, where are you going?

118
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,880
I can see stone buildings.
And Arabic signs.

119
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,960
- What do you see?
- Ruins.

120
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,240
Ruins from a city.

121
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,240
One moment, I can see a sign.
Ramala.

122
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,800
- Is anyone out?
- No one is around.

123
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,000
- Are we in another country?
- I don't know

124
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,400
Quiet.

125
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,560
Take her.

126
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:49,120
Get up and get dressed!

127
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,440
Hurry up.

128
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,960
Fast!

129
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:11,280
Calm down, do not resist.

130
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,520
Don't resist.

131
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,200
Come on, we are in a hurry.

132
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,720
Take her with you!

133
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,640
Move, everyone is looking at us.
Hurry up!

134
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,280
People are laughing at us.
Move!

135
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,560
No one will touch me!
I feel like I relive this.

136
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,400
- Give me a beer.
- Why for?

137
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,880
- What did you say?
- No one will touch me!

138
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,280
- That won't help.
- Anyone who touch me will see!

139
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,400
You better look at the
hotel than saying bullshit.

140
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:41,120
"She is small, She is big...
I'll beat her now", they said.

141
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,240
They are going us to Eilat.
Red Sea.

142
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,960
They brought us here.

143
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,000
Let's go! Hurry up!

144
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,040
Move.

145
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,800
This way! Come!

146
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,240
All right.

147
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,840
Leave the bags
and get naked!

148
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Igor, tell them.
Put your clothes off.

149
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,040
- Put your clothes off.
- Put their clothes off.

150
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,720
- Leave them all here!
- Move it, put your clothes off!

151
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,680
When you do it, come
here one by one. Come!

152
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,560
Not you,
bring the girls.

153
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,280
Tell them to hurry up.

154
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,480
Help her get naked!

155
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,400
You, come.

156
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,080
Move.

157
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,400
Get in line.

158
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,320
All right Igor. The shower.

159
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,000
- What is she doing?
- Catch her!

160
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,000
I want more pressure.
Open the water.

161
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,600
Can we make it warmer?

162
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,920
Split them in the place.

163
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,040
Don't let them be all together!

164
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,440
Split them!
Sacha, move on!

165
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,600
- Do you hear me?
- Stand there.

166
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,520
This one didn't finish.

167
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,360
All right. Bring towels.
What are they doing here?

168
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,560
Arrange her.
Move on.

169
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,760
Igor, bring me my clothes.

170
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,760
They torture us on purpose?

171
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,960
Move it!

172
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,000
Dry your hair!

173
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,920
Are we going to go half-naked
to the club?

174
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,600
Are you done? Take this.
No, you already have.

175
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,880
Who doesn't have pants?
Here.

176
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,080
- Perfect!
- All right.

177
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,040
- Faster!
- I'm trying.

178
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,440
Put this on.

179
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,240
- I need a bra.
- Who said that?

180
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,960
Here you are.

181
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,320
Is everyone all right?

182
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,680
One moment, my bag.

183
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,080
Go to hell!

184
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,760
Move on!

185
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,520
Let's go!

186
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,800
Is Sacha down?

187
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,520
Where are the others?

188
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,960
Bring all the girls here.
Get dressed.

189
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,280
Where are the others?
Bring them here.

190
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,720
Igor watch them.
I'll bring the make-up.

191
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,480
Where is the make-up?

192
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,520
Put off the towel.
Girls...

193
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,320
Prepare them.

194
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,360
Igor, where is the make-up?

195
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,160
Take it.

196
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,920
If sharks were humans...

197
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,800
they would build huge cages
in the sea...

198
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,840
and fill them up with
goodies for the small fish...

199
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,080
and they would keep them clean. 
Next.

200
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,640
For example...

201
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,760
If a fish got injured on the fin...

202
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,480
they would put him
a sticking immediately...

203
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,800
so it won't die immediately,
but stay alive...

204
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,640
till it end up in sharks belly.

205
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,240
Next.

206
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,000
Stop crying.
I cant put you make-up.

207
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,960
Stop crying.
Stop.

208
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,360
I'll treat you good.
Stop.

209
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,360
I know... I also left the homeland
years ago.

210
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,680
I was born in Germany,
near borders and I live there.

211
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,920
I was doing really good there...

212
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,960
I did what I wanted.
I was doing shows.

213
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,080
And then I fell in love with a
Hebrew...

214
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,800
but he didn't feel
good in that country...

215
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,680
and he wanted to go at Israel. 
I followed him.

216
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:13,280
When you are in love, you
follow your other half.

217
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,160
No one can restrict
you from loving him...

218
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,120
Its like electric load.

219
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,520
It creates a new world for both...

220
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,720
But you have to load him, or
you lose everything.

221
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,920
Maybe if we had a child...
That was it.

222
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,400
We didn’t have a kid so we
broke up.

223
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,720
Then I met another one,
Yussuf...

224
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,640
He showed me a new life and
I thought...

225
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,640
I thought...

226
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,880
that life is composed by
many roads...

227
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,240
that I wanted to discover.
I didn’t know where they were going me.

228
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,240
So...

229
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,240
I don’t live with him anymore.

230
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,480
But we are still collaborating.
Simple collaboration.

231
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,560
He got the north,
I got the south.

232
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,560
Like the Queen.

233
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,240
- You remind me someone...
- Who?

234
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,560
I don't know. 
Must be my sister...

235
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,440
- Stop crying.
- I'm so scared.

236
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,920
I want to calm you down.
I'll be good with you.

237
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:10,200
I want to be good.
Stop crying.

238
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,880
I don’t have much to give you.
Only this maybe, which I like.

239
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:41,200
Look what I’m going to give you.
Here, take it.

240
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:51,440
Its hard to give it to you.
I cant put it out easily.

241
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,880
Here you go. You're going to
work for me all right?

242
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:06,400
Imagine it as a job.
Only as a job.

243
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,680
Don't think you are a whore
you're just working.

244
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,840
I'll be always good with you.

245
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,960
What happened to that girl?

246
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,920
I think she died...

247
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,320
maybe not.

248
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,080
What are you looking at?
Mind your business!

249
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,640
- Listen to me!
- I'm not interested.

250
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,160
I'm not hitting on you. I only
want to talk to you. Listen to me.

251
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,840
- I'm not interested.
- Only you can help me!

252
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,800
You're the only one.
I won't see you again.

253
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,640
You've got to help me.
We are eight girls.

254
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,000
They brought us here
without our willing.

255
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,520
They hit us. We can't
even breath, Listen to me.

256
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,880
You've got to help me.
You're the only one who can.

257
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,640
Look at me! Imagine your
sister here...

258
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,560
and people touching her, and
fucking her and she crying.

259
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,040
- You have to help me.
- How?

260
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,240
I beg you, you'll think something.
Take me from here.

261
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,240
Help you to run away?

262
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:40,040
Find money
to pay someone.

263
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:45,720
I won't see you again.
I want you to come back...

264
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,160
- Why are you telling me all that;
- Only you can help me.

265
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,880
Please.

266
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,000
I can't do anything.

267
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,760
I'm sorry. I have to go.

268
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,080
Promise me you'll think about it.
Come back. That’s what I’m asking.

269
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,400
Its a foreign country,
I can't speak the language.

270
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,480
You'll think of something.
Come back.

271
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,240
I can't do anything.

272
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,000
Only think about it.

273
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:26,960
Who is that doll?
She is kissing with passion.

274
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,720
Look at Igor.
He's in the mood.

275
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,320
That was the club in Eilat.

276
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,120
She was looking at us.

277
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,560
She was there when
Bedouins were selling us.

278
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,800
- Maybe she wants to accompany us.
- Maybe she likes to look.

279
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:18,760
- She might help us.
- I talked with her. She might help us.

280
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,880
Help.

281
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,680
Welcome to Haifa.

282
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,400
Get lost.

283
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,600
Are they all here?
Bring them.

284
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:22,680
Cover up with that.

285
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,680
Rose, are you all right?

286
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,240
Don't frown.

287
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,920
- I didn't hear you.
- I said, don't frown.

288
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,680
Don’t frown?

289
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,360
Here?

290
01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:00,600
You're so beautiful.

291
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,880
Like an angel

292
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,800
Are you sick?

293
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,120
Physically, no.

294
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:50,400
I'm all right.

295
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:05,000
Get some rest...

296
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:31,320
- Water...
- Rain.

297
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,760
It rains a lot here.
All the time.

298
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,520
I can't believe that this is winter.
It's only raining.

299
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,840
Whenever Igor hit the sack...

300
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,760
I felt like he was
hitting one of us again...

301
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:02,560
and slowly we bowed to...

302
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:11,600
and accepted to be things,
statues or paintings.

303
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:17,000
Yussuf and Hezi were fighting
in a hebrew-arabic mixture.

304
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,960
They only agreed when they
were planning our future.

305
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,560
For how they were going to use us.

306
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,640
We were far away from the
landscapes of our child years.

307
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,800
Estonia looked far away.

308
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:38,200
We were just waiting to
finish, with one way or another.

309
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,320
Come on Katya. Come.

310
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:57,240
- That's Katya.
- I know.

311
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,720
- It's cold.
- It's cold, damn it!

312
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,440
Stop cursing, Katya.

313
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,560
Everyone get out of here!

314
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:24,840
You're disturbing our work!
Get out of here!

315
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,240
Now everything's all right.

316
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,520
Now everything's all right.

317
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,440
I'm free!

318
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,200
Wait!

319
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:45,680
Its time to reborn...

320
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:50,480
Its time to bow...

321
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:05,640
its time to get together...

322
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:25,320
Time to love...

323
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,960
Time to hate.

324
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,520
Time for war...

325
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,040
Time for peace.

326
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:38,240
What’s the profit man
has from all this work?
