611
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,907
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS 'CAUSE
I GOT A KID WITH SOME TALENT

612
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,701
AND YOU CAN'T GET HER.

613
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,036
HEY, HOW'D IT GO? DID
THEY LAUGH, THEY CRY?

614
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,538
NOBODY CRIED.

615
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,872
YOU KNOW, CHAPMAN, YOU'RE RIGHT.

616
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,126
IT'S DIFFICULT NOT TO BE JEALOUS
WITH SOMEONE WHO PEAKS AT 15,

617
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,421
DOES A COUPLE OF LOVE BOATS
AND A HOLLYWOOD SQUARES...

618
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,799
AND WINDS UP WORKING FOR DADDY
BECAUSE HE CAN'T GET A JOB

619
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,467
ANYWHERE ELSE.

620
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:45,139
I ALSO DID A CHARLIE'S ANGELS,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

621
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:53,105
HEY, HEY, HEY!
HOLD THE ELEVATOR.

622
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,567
HEY!
ANGIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

623
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,741
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU. CAN I
SPEAK TO YOU FOR JUST A MINUTE?

624
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,033
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

625
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,368
WE HAVE TO FINISH
THE AUDITIONS

626
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,661
JUST AS A COURTESY.

627
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,329
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING
FOR THIS GIRL FOR MONTHS.

628
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,416
BUT MR. CORCORAN
ABSOLUTELY LOVED ANGIE.

629
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,835
- SHE GOT THE JOB!

630
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,212

00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,383
I'M QUIET, QUIET.

THANK YOU.

NO, NO, NO,
THANK YOU.

635
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,555
HERE'S THE PAPERWORK.

636
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,599
WE NEED TO SEE ANGIE FOR A

637
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,727

YOU GOT IT.

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,209
I'M LOOKING

643
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,668
LENNY, WHO IS IT?

644
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,213
MY NAME IS MICHAEL CHAPMAN,
I'M A FRIEND...

645
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,135

YOU GOT IT. YOU ARE
THE SUNBURST COOKIE GIRL.

648
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,809
OUT OF HUNDREDS OF KIDS,
THEY PICKED YOU.

649
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,769
WHEN DO I GET THE MONEY?

650
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,146
YOU WANNA TRY TO HOLD DOWN
THE EXCITEMENT A LITTLE BIT?

651
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,689
WHEN DO WE GET THE MONEY?

652
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,149
AFTER WE SHOOT
THE FIRST COMMERCIAL!

653
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,109

655
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,695
ANGIE?

656
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,697
I REALLY WOULDN'T MIND TALKIN'
TO HER, IF THAT'S OKAY...

657
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,990
NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

658
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,034
UH, ANGIE?

659
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,497

[Woman]
AND YOU'RE FROM MOSCOW.

00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,882
THAT'S OUR HOMETOWN.

663
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,969
YOU ONLY HAD A MUSTACHE
IN THOSE DAYS.

664
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,930
OH, YOU LOOK
SO MUCH OLDER...

665
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,267
REMEMBER,
IT'S RUSSIA.

00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,994
MICHAEL, PLEASE, STOP.

00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,371
I HAVE THIS AUDITION TOMORROW.
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT?

672
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,291
DA, DA, DA, OKAY.

WHERE WERE WE?

UH, THAT'S ME.
THE LOVELORN MAJOR.

675
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,842
I WANTED-TELL ME

676
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,719
WHAT IS IT?

677
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,055
[Moaning]
[Knocking]

678

681
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,281
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

682
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,991
HERE'S ALL THE STUFF
YOU NEEDED SIGNED.

683
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,451
NOW?

684
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,620
OH, AND I ALSO THOUGHT
I SHOULD BRING THIS BACK.

685
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,871
WHOSE IS THIS?

686
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,539
- MR. COOKIEMAN'S.
- CORCORAN'S.

687
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,082
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

688
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,335
I ADMIT, IT WASN'T
SUCH A GREAT IDEA, BUT,

689
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,670
YOU KNOW, YOU GET IN A HABIT.

690
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,548
OH, HUH, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD COMPANY.

691
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,925
YEAH.

692
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,386
- HELLO, I'M DEBBIE.
- HI, I'M ANGIE.

693
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,057
- THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING.
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

694
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,643
AH, SHE WAS JUST DELIVERIN'
THIS STUFF. ANGIE'S A CLIENT.

695
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,437
OH, REALLY? ME TOO.

696
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,066
I THOUGHT HE JUST
REPRESENTED KIDS.

697
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,609
[Whispering]
NO!

698
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,027
IS THAT TRUE?

699
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,363
KIDS OF ALL AGES
IS WHAT SHE MEANT.

700
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,784
HUH! WELL, NO WONDER
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN A JOB!

701
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,285
YOU'RE A KID'S AGENT!

702
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,870
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU NEVER GOT A JOB?

703
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,872
I GOT YOU THAT JOB
IN THE TROJAN WOMEN.

704
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,290
OH, BIG DEAL!

705
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,918
ONE LOUSY PRODUCTION
IN A THEATER IN PASSAIC?

706
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,253
AND I HAD TO MAKE
THE COSTUMES TOO!

707
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,130
DEBBIE, DEBBIE, DEBBIE.

708
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,926
ANY CHANCE OF GETTING TIME OFF
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR?

709
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,679
NO.

710
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,223
DEBBIE! D-DEBBIE, D-DON'T GO.

711
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,016
NICE MEETING YOU, ANGIE.

712
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,268

[Sighs]

714
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,279
UH, DID I COME
AT A BAD TIME?

715
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,991
NO, NO. THAT WAS PERFECT.

716
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,534
THINK I'D GOTTEN
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING

717
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,035
I COULD OUT OF THE EVENING.

718
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,912
SO I WAS THINKING,
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE

719
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,330
ON THE COMMERCIALS AT HOME...

720
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,708
WITH LENNY
AND ALL HIS STUPID FRIENDS.

721
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:27,421
SO I THOUGHT I'D STAY HERE
UNTIL WE'RE DONE.

722
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,341
[Chuckles]
THAT'S THREE WEEKS AWAY.

723
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,400
- SO WHAT?
- SO WHAT?

724
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,971
SO I DON'T THINK YOUR SISTER'S
GONNA BE TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

725
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,433
LISTEN, I TAKE BETTER CARE
OF HER THAN SHE DOES OF ME.

726
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,687
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
SHE KNOWS I'M HERE. IT'S COOL.

727
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:48,817
IT'S NOT COOL.
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

728
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,694
I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE...

729
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,196
AND I'M REAL SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DOMESTIC PROBLEMS.

730
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,990
BUT THIS IS
MY LUCKY PAC-MAN PILLOW,

731
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,534
THIS IS MY HOUSE,
THIS IS YOUR BAG

732
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:03,165
AND THAT'S THE DOOR.
I LIKE MY PRIVACY.

733
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,375
MORE THAN YOUR COMMISSION?

734
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:13,216
WHAT, ARE YOU THREATENING ME?
I DON'T RESPOND WELL TO THREATS.

735
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,219
I WILL NOT BE THREATENED.

736
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,763
[Grunting]

737
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,515
[Angie]
YOU ARE SUCH A PIG!

738
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,685
YUCK!

739
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,276
[Knocking]

740
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,996
YEAH.

741
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,416
DO YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?
IS SHE STAYING WITH YOU?

742
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,002
THAT DEPENDS.
WHAT DID SHE DO?

743
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,921
HUH! I FOUND HER
IN THE HALL THIS MORNING,

744
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,924
THROWING OUT YOUR GARBAGE.

745
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,094
I'M SORRY, MRS. CANTRELL.
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

746
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,429
I HOPE IT HAPPENS
EVERY DAY.

747
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,932
USUALLY, THE GARBAGE
JUST SITS THERE,

748
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,934
SMELLING UP THE WHOLE PLACE.

749
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,977
NOT TO MENTION
THE CIGARETTE BUTTS.

750
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,270
DEAR?

751
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,772
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
TO GET READY FOR SCHOOL?

752
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,816
YEAH, RIGHT. IN MY NEXT LIFE.

753
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,234
LOOK AT THIS PLACE!

754
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,985
YEAH. THANK YOU,
MRS. CANTRELL.

755
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,780
[Mrs. Cantrell]
UUH!

756
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:56,486
GET AWAY FROM ME WITH THAT!
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE BREAKFAST.

757
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:33,541
UHH. UHH! OOH!

758
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,758
[Ed]
WHAT?

759
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,926
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

760
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,470
YOU LET HER STAY
IN YOUR APARTMENT?

761
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,889
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
I REALLY DON'T.

762
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,266
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.

763
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,684
WE FINALLY GET THE BIGGEST JOB
WE'VE HAD IN YEARS...

764
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,769
AND YOU'RE UPSET 'CAUSE
THERE'S A FEW LITTLE PROBLEMS.

765
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,229
