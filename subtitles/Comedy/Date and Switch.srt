1
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,381
<i>When I was born,
I had a thousand legs</i>

2
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,500
<i>Soon I'll be dancing
on a different stage</i>

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,421
<i>I'll go to sleep
inside a silk cocoon</i>

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,386
<i>And be reborn into the afternoon</i>

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,384
Good singing. Really good shit.

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,782
We're not supposed to curse.
We're doing a play.

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,982
I'm just saying, it's good shit.

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,982
<i>Deep down I know
I have to turn the page</i>

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,751
<i>But I wonder</i>

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,342
<i>Will I miss my legs?</i>

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,588
I've never, ever been so proud.

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,505
Honey, there's Matty.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,350
Oh, look at him.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,148
Oh, he's a natural performer.

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,946
- Oh.
- Oh.

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,150
Shit.

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,586
I don't wanna sing anymore.

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,065
Watch this.

19
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,227
- That's different.
- Oh, no, no, no.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,709
Come on. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,943
Later, motherfuckers!

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,108
We'll edit that out. Still proud.

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,626
Whoo!

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,826
Can't I just go see a nice musical
without it turning into something gay?

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,742
Hey, nothing illegal or
unprotected tonight. Promise?

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,671
- Dad, that's gross.
- I'm talking about sex.

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,784
You wrap that rascal. Make sure
you put a condom on your penis.

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,744
- Dad.
- All right, bye, Dad.

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,183
- That is a damn fine shirt you got on.
- Yeah, you like it?

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,303
You might go get a girl pregnant
with that shirt like that on.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,822
Well, I usually take my shirt
off first but, you know.

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,108
If you meet some nice
girls, party them hard.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,110
- I will. See you.
- All right, kiddo. Go get them.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,706
<i>We be the highest-ranking</i>

35
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,981
<i>Super-stanking</i>

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,824
<i>Filling up the bank
With Benjamin Franklins</i>

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,349
<i>Watch me do my thing, the B-boy
Batarang with the gold tooth swing</i>

38
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,761
<i>I'm strange,
But it ain't the same</i>

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,107
<i>Propane in the game
And I blow your brain</i>

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,544
<i>Watch me swing and swing
And hang, orangutan</i>

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,265
<i>My-my beat's like a bangarang</i>

42
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,225
<i>You got to move your feet
And prove to me</i>

43
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,990
<i>You got the beat,
Reveal your inner freak</i>

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,751
Yeah.

45
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,425
A shake isn't a sauce, man.

46
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,988
Oh, no. See, anything can be a sauce
if you put it on something else.

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,185
- Open up your mind.
- Whatever, I'm not worried about it.

48
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,782
See, those are the kinds of girls
we need to be going out with.

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,831
What would you say to that girl right
there if she came up to you right now?

50
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,021
Hi. Hello.

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,548
You're terrific, appearance-wise...

52
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,587
and I would like to take you out
for a food or beverage situation.

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,509
- Damn, that's smooth.
- Mm-hm.

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,360
- You been working on your game?
- Obviously.

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,547
It's apparent.

56
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,903
I've been going out with Ava
8 months and feel like more of a virgin...

57
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,427
than before we started
dating, if that's possible.

58
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,420
Oh, it is. You're like a super virgin. You
make other virgins look like huge sluts.

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,907
And so do you. And we
need to fix that, dude.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,790
We are due. We deserve adult, mature,
grown-up sexual relationships.

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,664
Yes.

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,263
- What toy did you get?
- I got Shelly the Crab.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,947
Well, I got the punching
crunching robot dudes.

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,380
- Oh, no.
- Take him out.

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,346
Hit him with the left. Knock
him out. Knock him out.

66
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,780
Boom, boom, boom.

67
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,347
- Ladies.
- Dorks.

68
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,467
I like you a lot.

69
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,985
Um, especially your body and
the hotness of that body.

70
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,625
You're a class act.

71
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,660
Potential wife material, if you were, like,
45 years old, all dried-up and shit.

72
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,387
And that's the problem. This relationship's
not progressing quickly enough...

73
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,227
- ...physically speaking.
- Look at you and then look at me.

74
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,101
You know, you're beautiful,
and I'm just kind of a mess.

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,742
Are you breaking up with me because
I won't have sex with you?

76
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,262
You call it sex, I call it a
physical expression of our bond.

77
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,781
I haven't showered in 6 days.

78
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,460
Like Indians becoming
blood brothers...

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,391
or football teammates
getting matching tattoos.

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,469
Except sex isn't as
permanent as a tattoo.

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,346
It's, like, 9 minutes, tops.
In and out, like a cat burglar.

82
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,951
It's just...

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,744
That's what I am to you, a hole
for you to go in and out of?

84
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,663
No, no, no. I value the person
built around that hole.

85
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,862
- What?
- I'm really sorry.

86
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,507
Ugh, okay. I get it.

87
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,544
- Are we okay? Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

88
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,980
Can I get a little
hug going on here?

89
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,222
You can be a real
asshole, you know that?

90
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,345
I could get any fucking guy I want.
I am so much hotter than you.

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,159
Do you even fucking
realize how hot I am?

92
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,750
Whoa, whoa, not the gummy bears.

93
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,427
Why don't you go outside
and chill out for a sec?

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,066
Fuck you Matty. Why don't you guys
fucking blow each other?

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,581
It's the most action you're
ever gonna get anyway.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,909
How was your breakup?

97
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,021
I can't believe we wasted
so much time with those two.

98
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,781
The high school chapter of our sexual
lives is rapidly coming to a close.

99
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,425
We need to begin phase 2.

100
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,941
We need to get our
dicks wet by prom.

101
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,586
Hm. I don't approve
of that language at all.

102
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,067
I'm going crazy, dude.
18 years of nothing.

103
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,463
I don't wanna wake up 20
years from now with regrets.

104
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,301
"Hey, buddy, sorry I didn't
put you in more things."

105
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,143
- Oops.
- Whoa, heh!

106
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,822
Man. That is a metric
ton of weed. Shit.

107
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,785
If we eat that whole brownie we're
gonna immediately grow dreadlocks.

108
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,469
We should go to cooking school and
learn how to make like a real weed cuisine.

109
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,222
I'm talking, like, leg of lamb with, like,
a weed reduction sauce or some shit.

110
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,385
Dude. Oh, what?
I have a genius idea.

111
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,744
We should save this brownie and eat it
as a reward for getting laid at prom.

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,143
Okay. So it's like our pot
at the end of the rainbow?

113
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,264
Except instead of a pot full of
gold, it's a pot full of pot.

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,304
- Yeah, I think that was implied of what I said.
- I got it all planned out.

115
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,583
We go to prom, have sex,
eat this brownie...

116
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,585
be high for a week straight,
then we go to college.

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,187
People will be like, "Those
two guys are so awesome."

118
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,189
- "They're definitely not virgins."
- Yeah.

119
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,429
Then we move back here,
we get, like, dead-end jobs...

120
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,867
we retire and we fucking die.

121
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,110
- If we time it right, we make it a double funeral.
- Oh, my God. That's a great plan.

122
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,381
Yeah.

123
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,110
- Isn't your dad gonna see this?
- He's a pussycat. He'll love it.

124
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,310
And he's got a new girlfriend
now, so he's a happy boy.

125
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,946
All right, man, um...

126
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,263
I'm gonna head out, but I will see
you tomorrow at band practice.

127
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,985
- All right, dude.
- All right.

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,505
Hey, you wanna go for a drive?

129
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,029
Um, I was just gonna go to sleep
after finishing this pair of tits.

130
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,906
No, eh, um, we should
definitely go for a drive.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,388
- Yo, is something wrong, dude?
- No.

132
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,582
Just going for a drive.

133
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,627
All right, listen, man.

134
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,147
All this talking
we've been doing...

135
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,267
like, about sex and the future and, like,
the rest of our lives and all that shit...

136
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,269
has got me feeling a little guilty.

137
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,981
- Why?
- Look, you're my best friend.

138
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,261
- You know that.
- Heh.

139
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,470
And so, I owe this to you.

140
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,264
Yeah, man. What is it?

141
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,425
I'm a gay dude.

142
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,225
What?

143
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,384
I'm a gay dude.

144
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,511
Like, I'm a gay?

145
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,701
Like "gay" gay?

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,588
Like, "dicks and butts" gay?
Or like, "retarded" gay like,

147
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,067
"Man, Nicolas
Cage movies are gay"?

148
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,151
No, like, "I'm a dude who's
attracted to other dudes" gay.

149
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,582
- What? No, you're just a dude.
- No, exactly. A gay dude.

150
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,946
I mean, fuck, you're all
out of shape and shit.

151
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,188
Oh, really? Yeah, no,
dude, I fucking know.

152
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,105
Look, I'm not into curtains,
I've never watched the Tonys.

153
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,789
I'm never gonna wear, like, a deep
V-neck T-shirt, but I am gay.

154
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,427
When did you first realize this?
Like, is this a recent development?

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,667
No. Fuck no.

156
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,306
You remember when we were
kids, like 6 or 7 years old...

157
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,709
we used to give that guy half of our sandwiches
through the chilling fence at school?

158
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,107
Yeah, yeah. That guy
was a homeless guy.

159
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,428
Yeah, and I kind of
had a crush on him.

160
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,469
- You were gay for the homeless guy?
- He was ruggedly handsome.

161
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,506
You wanted to fuck a hobo when you
were 7, that's what you're telling me?

162
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,980
That's what I'm telling you man.

163
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,945
I wanted to feel the touch
of his dirty hobo hands.

164
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,222
This is crazy.

165
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,031
I mean, you've dated
more girls than I have.

166
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,790
That's more of a you problem to be honest.

167
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,187
You tell Em? Did you tell
her before you told me?

168
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,502
Yeah. Yeah. Look, dude,
she's super cool.

169
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,704
I don't wanna fuck up her life
with unnecessary falsehoods.

170
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,109
Wow, fuck.

171
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,662
- You're a gay dude.
- Yeah.

172
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,430
- I'm a gay dude.
- Are you sure?

173
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,667
You know what? Let me think about it for another
18 years and I'll get back to you.

174
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,140
- Yes, I'm fucking sure Michael.
- All right man.

175
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,946
Well, shit, the whole brownie
thing's out the window.

176
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,983
- No. I wouldn't eat that brownie
- Probably wouldn't have broken up...

177
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,467
with Ava without our whole
big plan. She's so hot.

178
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,111
Yeah, and so out of your league.

179
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,667
Dude, have you seen her
boobs and her stomach area?

180
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,228
Like, her stomach is almost
as hot as her boobs.

181
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,784
Right? Can you even wrap
your brain around that?

182
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,589
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
it's a tight stomach.

183
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,670
I don't know what to
tell you. Like, it's nice.

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,664
No, no, no. Dude,
this is fine. It's good.

185
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,067
- I get it. You like dicks now.
- Yeah.

186
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,629
You are a man who aspires to handle the
scrotums of other men in his free time.

187
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,541
Listen, I haven't got that far. I don't
really know how I feel about scrotums.

188
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,511
Look, all I know...

189
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,266
- ...is that this has to stay a secret.
- Yeah.

190
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,940
I'm not ready for, like, the
big gay coming-out shit.

191
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,630
- You know what I mean?
- Sure. Yeah.

192
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,620
And seriously, you can tell
me, like, are we cool?

193
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,505
Yeah, dude. You're
my best friend, man.

194
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,225
Everything's...

195
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,860
- it's cool, man.
- Yeah?

196
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,860
Hey, man, um, I know I dropped a big
fat fucking gay bomb on you tonight.

197
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,666
<i>I don't know if things
ended right or whatever...</i>

198
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,263
<i>but, uh, look, dude, I don't want shit
to be awkward or weird, you know?</i>

199
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,307
<i>Not that it would be.</i>

200
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,108
<i>But, um, you should give me
a call when you get this.</i>

201
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,144
<i>Long awkward message.</i>

202
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,264
<i>Sorry. Bye.</i>

203
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,385
How do they know that dog is gay?

204
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,829
- Michael, you left your back...
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

205
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,785
- ...pack in the...
- So hello, Dad.

206
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,189
How are things?

207
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,344
They're wonderful, son.
How are things with you?

208
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,982
Well. They're well, thank you.

209
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,711
Excellent. I'm glad to hear that.

210
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,551
- I'm just gonna set this down now.
- Sure. Cool. Cool.

211
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,789
<i>Oh, yeah. Fuck that cock. Yeah.</i>

212
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,381
Is there anything you'd
like to talk to me about?

213
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,787
Oh, no. Nothing. Nothing at all.

214
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,706
<i>Choke on that horse dick. Oh, yeah.</i>

215
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,707
Michael, I want you to know
there's nothing wrong...

216
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,546
- ...with what you're doing right now.
- I'm not doing what you think I'm doing.

217
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,341
It's a very natural urge
at your age, a curiosity.

218
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,749
Or, you know, it could
be more than that.

219
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,671
And if it is, I'm 100
percent okay with that too.

220
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,422
No, you don't have to be okay with
anything because this is nothing. Really.

221
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,544
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No.

222
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,506
Because this is just a bunch
of research. Nothing more.

223
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,589
Just non-sexual research.

224
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,430
<i>I'm living in your asshole.</i>

225
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,987
<i>That asshole is where
my dick lives.</i>

226
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,065
Okay.

227
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,068
When you're ready and you
wanna talk, I'm here.

228
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,548
I love you and nothing can change that.
Remember that. I'm proud of you.

229
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,942
<i>Oh, yeah. I'm choking on your cum.</i>

230
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,747
Thanks.

231
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,224
Uh, could you knock before
coming in here in the future?

232
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,391
Of course. You stay strong.

233
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,626
Um, if you need space, you can
put some stuff in my locker.

234
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,664
Thanks. There's so
much shit in here.

235
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,911
My dad gave me a bunch of his old cameras
for photography class...

236
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,182
what I didn't tell him
is for my project...

237
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,021
I'm actually gonna take pictures
of these cameras using my phone.

238
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,345
- That is so sad for those cameras.
- Yeah, getting old sucks.

239
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,146
- Hey, can I talk to you about something?
- Sure.

240
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,787
So Matty told me about the thing.

241
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,267
What thing?

242
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,949
The thing, about the
gayness in his "payness."

243
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,420
I don't know why I said
"payness." That was weird.

244
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,668
Yeah. Well, good.
I'm glad he told you.

245
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,190
He needs people around him that he can
open up to right now, people he can trust.

246
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,860
- I can be that person.
- That's good.

247
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,342
Should I get him a
gift or something?

248
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,464
- Balloons or a cake?
- Balloons, probably not.

249
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,504
A cake. You should get him a
cake and you should have it say:

250
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,145
"You're gay, and you're fabulous."

251
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,830
- Really?
- No, heh.

252
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,024
- Don't make him feel weird about it.
- You're right. Nothing has to change.

253
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,826
- Are you okay?
- Definitely. Definitely.

254
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,502
I'm definitely not feeling weird about losing my
best friend to the gay side. It's all good.

255
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,543
Keep on trucking.
We're couple knuckleheads.

256
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,107
Take it to the bank, sister.
Think about that.

257
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,422
Matty, you're in a band, really?

258
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,022
Oh, yeah, it's a instrumental
TV theme song cover band.

259
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,944
But we don't wanna
put a label on it.

260
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,423
Smart. Don't let the man
tell you who you are.

261
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,430
Ever think about adding the
popular part of music, the singing?

262
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,564
Well, yeah.

263
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,327
Little tip. It might
help you in the audition.

264
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,631
Good to know.

265
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,390
- Michael, you need a pen?
- No.

266
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,503
- I'm with him.
- Oh, are you really?

267
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,471
Because you weren't yesterday
at practice when we needed you.

268
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,226
I called you 7 times and everyone was
like, "Where is Michael?"

269
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,468
- Can I just talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

270
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,984
I'll turn the volume up so we can
talk without anyone hearing.

271
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,831
So you punched the brownie?

272
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,102
That's not like you at all.
You love baked goods.

273
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,751
I'm not gonna lie to you, man.

274
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,911
You being gay all of a sudden, like,
without warning, I was a little mad.

275
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,666
And confused. But I thought
about the whole thing.

276
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,660
I've really thought about it
and, you know, it's cool.

277
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,462
Seriously, I even stayed up and fixed the
brownie. I did major structural repairs.

278
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,743
That's awesome, man. Thanks.

279
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,828
It looks even better than before. I frosted some
dicks and butts on it in your honor.

280
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,706
- Dicks and butts? You're a great friend.
- I'm on board.

281
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,790
I wanna go on this gay journey
with you. You're my best friend.

282
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,870
Nothing has to change.
We're still... We're on a mission.

283
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,903
We need to get each
other laid by prom.

284
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,946
Alright we need to get these dicks wet, bro,
or whatever you call it with gay guys.

285
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,184
Get shit on your dick?
Get shitty-dicked?

286
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,223
There's probably a
better term for it.

287
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,151
So we're doing this, man.
I wanna get you laid.

288
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,468
- You're in, right?
- I'm in.

289
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,460
There's a lot of fish in the sea.
Lady fish and dude fish.

290
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,823
Straight fish and gay fish.

291
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,949
- High school dudes are weird.
- Yeah, not great.

292
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,024
Holy shit. This is it.
The mother lode.

293
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,551
Oh, dude. Theater kids?

294
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,981
No, I don't think I should
talk to them right now.

295
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,911
You have to put your ass out there if you
wanna get something put in it.

296
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,149
Dude I just came out to you. I have to go talk
to other gay people immediately?

297
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,224
Dude, that's what friends do.
Friends wingman each other.

298
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,220
And I hate that word I think it's stupid but it's what
I'm gonna do to you whether you like it or not.

299
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,991
Not that I don't appreciate it.
It's just I think that...

300
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,705
This is an American tradition.

301
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,389
Having sex by prom is a story told over
and over again by our greatest writers.

302
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,586
<i>Huck Finn, Moby Dick, Ulysses, The Iliad,</i>
they're all about having sex by prom.

303
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,586
- No, I don't think they are.
- But it feels like they are.

304
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,827
What about you, man?

305
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,069
You're nowhere near having sex
with anything anytime soon.

306
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,911
I'm pretty sure I can still
hook it up with Ava.

307
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,584
Fuck. That guy?

308
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,631
Come on. One of us is gonna
make some progress today.

309
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,188
Reflections, the center of
Glen Ellen's gay universe.

310
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,147
It's good to be back at a bar.

311
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,103
Did you know that this is one
of my top 5 favorite bars?

312
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,347
Yeah, it is.

313
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,831
- Oh, thank you.
- Cool, cool, cool.

314
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,829
This is the only bar in town that doesn't
care how shitty our fake IDs are.

315
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,341
Dude, this is great.

316
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,983
Okay. Well, no wonder
they let us in.

317
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,989
Dude, this is bad.

318
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,191
This is really bad. This is like a more
depressing version of a regular bar.

319
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,348
That guy over there looks like
he's having a great time.

320
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,306
Come on. Come on.

321
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,501
- Hey, guys. How's it going?
- Hey, guys.

322
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,429
Are you guys new guys?
You're probably new guys.

323
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,464
Everyone here is a regular.
I'd recognize you if you were new.

324
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,470
Yeah, yeah. This is Matty.
I'm Michael. He's gay, I'm not.

325
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,704
- I'm Jared and I'm very gay.
- Yeah, we noticed.

326
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,949
Do you guys go to Glen Ellen?
It's cool. I go to Valley Springs.

327
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,541
Go Panthers. I feel like
I know the scene there...

328
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,141
and you guys seem like
GHS kids. Boo, Huskies.

329
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,463
- Yeah, yeah, we go to Glen Ellen.
- Awesome.

330
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,708
So do you wanna fuck later?

331
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,990
Holy shit.

332
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,781
Dude, that guy is ready to
fuck right now. What's wrong?

333
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,109
He has a ring in his eyebrow
and glitter on his everything.

334
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,745
- So?
- He was too gay.

335
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,221
Don't be homophobic, bro.

336
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,264
- Come on, now, what's your type?
- My type? I don't think I have a type.

337
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,825
Of course you do. Everone else has a type.
What is it?

338
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,547
Look, we should just chill out,
like, have a beer, relax.

339
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,589
- Can we do that, please?
- Yeah, yeah.

340
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,470
- Hi, again.
- Hey, Jared.

341
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,190
It's gonna be a no for the fucking.

342
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,145
Shh, gonna get some E.
Do you want some E?

343
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,149
- You want some.
- Don't want any ecstasy you know.

344
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,787
I'll get you some E
and then we'll talk.

345
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,867
- E for enthusiasm.
- Yeah, certainly.

346
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,146
- This is useless.
- You're super lucky.

347
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,071
Look, when you're gay, you get
nonstop sex all the time...

348
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,228
no strings attached. It's amazing.

349
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,026
I'm not gonna just have sex
with anyone because I'm gay.

350
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,747
- I'm gay, I'm not a whore.
- I'm back with your ecstasy, boys.

351
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,903
Yeah Jared. We were very specific.
We don't want it.

352
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,302
Have you even tried it before?

353
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,984
Oh, my God.

354
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,104
- You're really good at dancing.
- I don't think I'm dancing.

355
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,985
Jared, get out of here.
Leave those guys alone.

356
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,549
Mr. Vernon, you're here?

357
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,302
Yeah, so are you.

358
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,390
We're all here.

359
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,950
Chris, you remember Michael
and Matty from school?

360
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,148
- Hey, guys.
- Mr. Dennis.

361
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,547
- You used to be in my fourth period.
- You gave me a C.

362
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,827
So you're not gonna talk
about this to anyone?

363
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,746
Oh, no, no. Of course not. I think it would
be a good idea if you guys went home.

364
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,029
I can't really talk to you while
you're underage drinking.

365
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,710
- Of course.
- Yeah.

366
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,905
And it'd be nice to keep this quiet
on both ends, if that makes sense.

367
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,228
- Totally understand.
- Yeah.

368
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,871
I really look forward to not making eye
contact with you tomorrow at school.

369
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,903
Dude, Mr. Vernon. I had no idea.

370
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,502
Yeah, and Mr. Dennis? You think
they've done it at school?

371
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,863
Come on, man. By the way,
I appreciate the sentiment.

372
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,507
But this is the worst and only
gay bar I've ever been to.

373
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,422
- Oh, fuck.
- What the F?

374
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,982
- Oh, fuck a duck.
- Oh, shit.

375
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,341
What were you doing?

376
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,987
I'm driving, man. It's not my fault you drive
the smallest car in the universe.

377
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,387
What is that? Is that
like a Diet Kia?

378
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,423
Hey, You could have really injured us.
You even care?

379
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,991
You just said "could have."

380
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,309
You've officially acknowledged
that no harm has been done. Okay.

381
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,623
This thing is trashed.
I'm gonna need a new thing.

382
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,026
Look at this.

383
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,951
Now, this is the time when we
get our insurance information.

384
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,302
Um, uh, uh, uh.

385
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,980
No. I'm gonna go ahead
and leave now, okay?

386
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,870
- Dude.
- What the fuck?

387
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,550
Come on.

388
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,069
Hey! Hey, stop. Yeah, you're
not gonna run me over.

389
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,990
- Be cool.
- He just wants to talk.

390
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,694
Chill, man.

391
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,175
I'm totally chill. Super
chill. I'm very cool.

392
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,826
- You smell like an old tent.
- What's wrong with you?

393
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,466
Honestly I have a Baconator and
I wanna get home and eat it.

394
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,826
What the fuck's a Baconator?

395
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,022
It's a really delicious
sandwich from Wendy's.

396
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,303
Dude, just give me
your information.

397
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,020
- Mike, maybe we should call the cops.
- We can't call the cops.

398
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,268
We're underage and we
had a bunch of beers.

399
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,268
- Did you just...? Did you push me?
- Maybe.

400
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,821
Okay, then it's gonna be go time.

401
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,342
- Which is... It's okay, it's just...
- Oh, shit.

402
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,627
- What was that, dude? You tripped me?
- Heh, yeah, I did.

403
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,426
You tripped me?
Who the fuck trips people?

404
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,510
I do. I took a vow recently that
I would stop punching people.

405
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,668
Because I was doing that too much.

406
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,864
I'm trying to be less violent
in general. So okay.

407
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,826
- He did trip you, like, really well.
- I know, dude. But whose side are you on?

408
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,744
- All right.
- Ha, ha.

409
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,305
Dude, that was
actually pretty dope.

410
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,582
I think we're ready.
I think that's the audition song.

411
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,544
Yeah, yeah. Well, Mike...

412
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,027
we've actually been having
some discussions...

413
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,740
- ...about the direction of the band.
- What is that mean?

414
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,829
Well, we've been talking.

415
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,985
And we think it's about time we add
some songs with vocals to the set list.

416
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,023
You know like Cheers and Charles in Charge.

417
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,110
<i>Saved by the Bell. Saved by
the Bell: College Years.</i>

418
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,904
Yeah, the list goes on and on.

419
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,023
And more importantly,
Mr. Vernon straight up and told me:

420
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,951
"You're not playing prom
unless you have a singer."

421
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,144
Yeah, well, that's not what we are.
That's not what we do. So...

422
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,308
- I mean, who would even sing?
- You would.

423
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,111
What? No, I can't.

424
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,588
You have a beautiful voice man. You were
the star of that musical in third grade.

425
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,585
Thank you.

426
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,229
But no. No, no way. I mean, I'm not
gonna sing in front of people.

427
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,309
Why do we have to change up things?

428
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,946
Everything's fine the
way it is right now.

429
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,071
- Hey, fags.
- Shit, it's your brother.

430
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,230
- Time's up. Get out of the garage.
- It's not 5:00 yet, Lars.

431
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,822
Yeah, well, we're starting early.
Got to nail down this Daughtry medley.

432
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,150
Oh, that's a medley? I thought that was one
incredibly long, incredibly shitty song.

433
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,627
Nice try, Matty. But
you can't rile me up.

434
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,709
We're so focused and
tight right now.

435
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,585
- Me, Brandon and Chad.
- I'm Mark.

436
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,067
You're 30 years old and you play
with high school kids.

437
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,662
And our band rules. Now get the fuck
out of the garage so we can practice.

438
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,387
- Fine.
- Come on guys. I wanna show you my lizards.

439
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,221
All right, Mikey. I have compiled
a list of songs that have vocals.

440
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,982
I want you to learn the lyrics. And next
time we're in here, we'll just.. we'll rock them out.

441
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,947
Okay, so this club is
called Club Monsoon.

442
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,711
And it looks like
it's on the Eastside.

443
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,302
Am I gonna end up with a
glow stick up my ass?

444
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,671
Yes, but the man holding that glow stick
just might be your future husband.

445
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,101
- Hello, welcome to Club Monsoon.
- Hey.

446
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,263
- For two?
- Yeah.

447
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,104
Glow sticks.

448
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,391
Do you think these guys know
they're living a cliche?

449
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,230
How are you supposed
to meet anybody in here?

450
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,267
I think you just dance with them until their
dick accidentally slips inside of you.

451
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,829
All right.

452
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,067
Excuse me.

453
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,582
Sir, a little bit of space,
a little bit more space. Okay.

454
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,829
Okay, all right. My
fault for being here.

455
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,988
Two mojitos, please.

456
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,427
- Can we hit that?
- It's not what you think it is.

457
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,147
- That isn't some of that dank Kush?
- No, it's salvia.

458
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,823
It gives you the best dream of your life
for 15 minutes, and then it's over.

459
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,383
- Is it safe?
- Well, it's legal.

460
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,063
Whoa, you guys got to be in your
underwear to be in the foam room.

461
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,786
No shirt, no shoes, no pants.
That's our policy.

462
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,711
Shirt? I'm not even wearing a face.

463
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,427
Woo-hoo!

464
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,190
Above and beyond, gentlemen.

465
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,670
It's a waterfall! This is the
best waterfall I've ever seen!

466
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,428
Yeah! You guys are
such good dancers.

467
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,510
Music is shooting out of his body.

468
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,668
It's magical.

469
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,547
What if there was no clocks ever?
You know what would you do?

470
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,141
What would you do in a day? If there
was no clocks, no time.

471
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,030
- Build a clock.
- Uh-huh.

472
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,668
- Jared!
- Jared!

473
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,308
- Okay.
- Somebody's not wearing panties tonight.

474
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,543
This is the best night of my life!

475
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,748
It was fun. It was fun, right?

476
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,308
Not too bad. Not bad at all.

477
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,191
Just hanging out in
there, just doing stuff.

478
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,863
- Not different from what we usually do.
- What are you talking about?

479
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,143
We were dancing naked with a bunch
of dudes in a room full of foam.

480
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,860
It's like that one time when I
made us take tango lessons...

481
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,064
- ...because it'd help us meet girls.
- No. It's not. This is completely different.

482
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,144
This is completely different than anything we've
ever done in our lives, ever.

483
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,628
Well, at least, you know,
we're still doing it together.

484
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,029
Yeah, but, dude, is this my future?
Like a bunch of trips to Club Monsoon?

485
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,429
Is that so bad? They had, like, cool
furniture and lights and stuff.

486
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,385
- It was like Europe in there.
- Not all of Europe is gay.

487
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,584
Whatever. Dude, the important
thing is we're still friends.

488
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,061
We've got the brownie,
all that stuff.

489
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,661
Everything is better with
lasers and smoke machines.

490
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,340
You love lasers, you love smoke.
That was a paradise for you.

491
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,504
Am I wrong? I know you.
I know you better than anyone.

492
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,748
Dude, it was amazing.
It was like Europe.

493
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,103
It was also in the future,
and also, it's a horror movie.

494
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,150
- What are you doing?
- I got locked out of my house.

495
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,827
Can I come in?

496
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,103
She was just texting on her phone
throughout the entire movie.

497
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,464
And I was so mad I was just throwing
popcorn in her face without even realizing it.

498
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,470
You haven't been even listening to
anything I'm been saying, have you?

499
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,708
- No, yeah, I am.
- Wait a minute. Are you high?

500
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,823
- No.
- You totally are.

501
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,944
I can tell. You're never
this quiet for this long.

502
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,544
Yeah. I smoked salvia tonight.

503
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,266
Holy shit. Was it awesome?

504
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,826
- No.
- You seem kind of traumatized.

505
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,063
It's okay. You don't have to
tell me about it right now.

506
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,107
You can tell me about it
whenever you want, really.

507
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,951
You can talk to me about
anything, whenever you want.

508
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,384
- You're patting me on the head like a dog.
- I am doing that. Heh, I'm sorry.

509
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,871
Wait.

510
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,744
You are drunk.

511
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,511
- Heh, yeah.
- I knew it.

512
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,261
- You're all chatty and shit.
- I killed a bunch of my dad's bourbon.

513
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,464
- Nice.
- And then you came over.

514
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,301
And now we're here,
with cheese and bread.

515
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,142
You, me, cheese, bread, here.

516
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,626
Life sucks.

517
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,024
Yeah, life sucks.

518
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,031
But I guess sometimes it doesn't.

519
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,660
Wait, wait, wait.

520
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,664
What are we doing?

521
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,220
I don't know. What are you doing?

522
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,584
I don't know.

523
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,228
- What are you doing?
- Oh, hey.

524
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,511
Uh...

525
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,142
- I should go, heh.
- Yeah, heh, you should.

526
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,620
Yeah.

527
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,431
My clothes are over there.

528
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,182
So can you turn around?

529
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,626
Okay.

530
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,744
Should we talk about what
happened last night?

531
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,027
We were fucked up.

532
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,226
We are, in general, fucked up.

533
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,188
If it had to be with a girl,
I'm glad it was with you.

534
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,150
Thank you?

535
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,144
Yeah.

536
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,900
Bye.

537
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:58,151
Reading? I love books.
Books are like word movies.

538
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,981
- What do you want, Michael?
- Nothing, just two friends hanging out.

539
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,343
- Talking, swapping stories.
- You just spit on me.

540
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,430
Did I? Sorry, sometimes that happens
when I start talking too fast.

541
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,106
I think some of it got in my mouth.

542
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,304
- Do you wanna go to prom with me?
- What? No.

543
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,230
Okay. I know I dumped you and
that was probably painful...

544
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,988
but I realized that was a mistake
and I think we can get past that.

545
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,466
- I'm going with Anthony.
- Really?

546
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,668
Or Lucas or Damien. You know, there's
a lot of balls in the air right now, so...

547
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,103
- There are? What happened?
- I'm dating around.

548
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,023
Dating around? You don't...
You don't date around...

549
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,222
That's not... You were...
You know, you were...

550
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,541
- We didn't even get past third base.
- We never got past second.

551
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,060
It's an imprecise metaphorical
system. It's open to interpretation.

552
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,661
- You just spit on me again.
- Sorry.

553
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,421
- I have to go. I'm late for color guard.
- You can't guard colors.

554
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,702
It's a stupid name.

555
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,900
It should be called flag spinning.

556
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,630
Hey, welcome to Catch a Burger.
Those are sweet cargo shorts.

557
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,709
- Thank you.
- May I take your order? My name is Pete.

558
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,904
Yes, I would like a Bacon Symphony
and a large order of fries.

559
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,746
- Okay, 5.66.
- Here you go.

560
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,421
And can I give your change to the Catch
a Burger Courageous Kids Program?

561
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,182
- No, thank you. I'll just take the change.
- I guess you can't afford the 34 cents.

562
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,065
Or you wanted to put it to
better use than give it to the Courageous Kids.

563
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,785
I mean...

564
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,188
Yeah, you know what? I'll give my
money to the kids' program. Sure.

565
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,862
You know for additional $2, I can make you a Catch a
Burger Courageous Kids Ambassador.

566
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,542
Thank you, but I'd will just
like to eat my food.

567
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,742
Yeah, yeah.

568
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,625
- Hey, do you have parents?
- Yeah of course. Everyone has parents.

569
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,903
Not the Catch a Burger Courageous
Kids. They're orphans, man.

570
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,108
- That's what makes them so courageous.
- It's $2?

571
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,461
- It's $2.
- Yeah, I have $2.

572
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,549
Thanks so much.
Just put it in the box.

573
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,462
- Fill out one of those guys for me.
- Can I order while he's doing this?

574
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,707
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

575
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,590
You know what would be really cool?

576
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,586
If you'd do what he's doing preemptively.
It's just 2 bucks, really help a lot of kids.

577
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,743
- I haven't ordered yet.
- But the big man is doing it...

578
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,511
and he looks like he
has fucking no money.

579
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,346
- Okay. Let's do it. Yeah.
- Thanks, bro.

580
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,270
- I met you at the place before.
- Yes, I struck you with my truck.

581
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,027
- Hey, do you guys have little brothers?
- Um, I have an older brother.

582
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,302
No, I'm talking about the
Big Brother Big Sister program.

583
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,821
You guys are the right age for it.
I've done it for 3 years.

584
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,991
And it has been the best
experience of my whole life.

585
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,549
Really changed me, you know?

586
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,550
I gotta tell you about my little brother,
Pirom. He's from Cambodia.

587
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,220
Came over here on a boat
when he was a baby.

588
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,503
He lost his father when he was 2.

589
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,911
Now he plays the fucking
cello, man. Heh, imagine that.

590
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,311
That guy's incredible.

591
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,067
That guy's like a drug dealer
for the concept of charity.

592
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,787
Um, I think I owe you an apology
for my behavior the other night.

593
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,823
I was not in a good place.

594
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,821
Um, I'd just taken my dog to the vet
because he ate an entire soccer ball.

595
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,385
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

596
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,187
Well, I'm sorry too. My buddy
gets really nervous sometimes.

597
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,621
- Or all the time.
- Well, I'm very intimidating.

598
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,389
Yeah by far, I'm the toughest guy you're
even gonna meet outside Reflections.

599
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,663
Okay? Right here. All right.

600
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,063
You, uh, you like that place?
You like that scene?

601
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,701
Um, it was interesting.

602
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,665
Yeah, it was my first
time there, so...

603
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,151
Is that a place that you often,
uh, are around or, uh, inside of?

604
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,067
Not much on ambience.

605
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,151
But they do have this one incredible
craft beer that you gotta try.

606
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,305
It's not to be missed. It's
called Bud Light. It's so good.

607
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,821
- I'm Greg.
- I'm Matty. Nice to meet you.

608
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,421
- Nice to meet you.
- Let me tell you about my little brother Pirom.

609
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,143
- He came over on a boat...
- Do you wanna watch this one more time?

610
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,580
- Yes.
- Okay.

611
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,666
Em. Em.

612
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,950
Hey.

613
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,990
- Can you do me a huge favor?
- What?

614
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,466
I need a ride.

615
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,589
Well, thanks for driving
me to the shop.

616
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,347
Heh, no problem. I got in an
accident the day I got my license...

617
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,663
and my parents totally freaked
out so I know what it's like.

618
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,182
- How many accidents have you been in?
- Like, 5 or 6.

619
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,822
Wait, seriously? Should
I be driving with you?

620
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,465
Oh, shit, I got a text. Hold on.

621
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,946
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

622
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,661
I'm kidding. I've
only been in 4.

623
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,545
- You have nothing to worry about, heh...
- Watch the road, please.

624
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,151
Wow.

625
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,588
- Hey, have you talked to Matty recently?
- No.

626
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,942
He's been acting really weird.

627
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,949
- Really?
- Yeah.

628
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,542
I mean, I know it's not an easy
time, but, um, I don't know.

629
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,188
No English? Can you...?
The bumper, bumpero is no good.

630
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,022
It needs changing. Come back. You can't
just do this. My bumper's messed up.

631
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,463
- Does anyone here speak English?
- What's going on?

632
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,107
I'm screwed. No one here
speaks any English and...

633
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,664
So you're just gonna drive around
with a big old red bumper...

634
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,510
on your little periwinkle car?

635
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,629
It's gun metal and it might not
be so bad if I drive at night.

636
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,551
No, they messed up your car.
That's unacceptable. Excuse me.

637
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,546
You don't have to, uh...

638
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,227
Don't yell at him.

639
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,869
Heh, thank you.

640
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,660
This shit is so much better
than that American shit.

641
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,591
These guys are Mexican.
They are hardcore.

642
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,106
- Oh, who's this guy?
- Oh, yeah, that is the Super Gato.

643
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,707
He's like a man-cat thing.
Shit.

644
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,062
These thing likes when he beats somebody,
he pours milk on him...

645
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,981
and then he, like, licks it off.
He calls it "licking the leche."

646
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,182
- No, I'm not into that.
- It's not okay.

647
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,905
That's weird.

648
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,786
- What about this gentleman right here?
- Yeah! Yeah!

649
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,587
That's El Scientifico Loco, it's the
mad scientist. He's my favorite.

650
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,431
He's like the Mexican
version of Stephen Hawking.

651
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,470
And he rolls around wreckles in his little
chair, acting like a bitch.

652
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,904
And then he gets bullied and just
rises up and regulates. It's awesome.

653
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,504
Dude, how are you a gay guy?

654
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,029
I don't know. I just am.

655
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,147
- How are you a gay guy?
- I don't know, man.

656
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,466
- This is fun. Like, it's a good time.
- Yeah.

657
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,385
I enjoy hanging out with you, man.

658
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,583
You know, you're like a good
friend-type dude, person thing.

659
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,827
Thank you, man.

660
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,469
Yes. Um, yeah, it's easy
to get a quick lay...

661
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,664
but the friendship part
is hard to come by.

662
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,469
- Yeah! Yeah, that's it.
- Fuck him up!

663
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,469
Oh, shit.

664
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,783
- Fuck, yeah!
- Fuck you, cat!

665
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,900
Here comes the robot voice.

666
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,467
- What?
- Here comes the robot voice. Hold on.

667
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,707
And...

668
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,467
Yeah!

669
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,545
Yes, you are <i>el campeon</i>.
Yeah, you are <i>el campeon</i>.

670
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,310
- Oh, shit.
- Bring it in right here.

671
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,867
Okay, yeah. I shouldn't
have had a drink.

672
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,307
I shouldn't have had
a drink. Yeah, okay.

673
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,265
- Meet me in the parking lot.
- Yeah, yeah.

674
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,305
You got it, man.

675
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,068
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

676
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,300
- Whoa, what is that?
- That is your mom's anniversary gift.

677
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,350
Another reminder that
I got life by the balls.

678
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,151
- Check it out.
- Is that one of those rotisserie grills?

679
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,787
No, it is the Ronco
Showtime Rotisserie.

680
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,142
I nailed it. She is gonna love it.

681
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,906
You know why? Women
love kitchen stuff.

682
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,708
I mean, as much as we like to deny it
in this PC day and age, it's true.

683
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,667
Men like cars, men like trucks.
This, it's like a truck to her.

684
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,466
Oh, I thought I heard voices.

685
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,585
Oh, my God.

686
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,908
- No, you did not.
- Oh, I did.

687
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,070
- Is that the Ronco Showtime?
- Yes, ma'am.

688
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,342
- Set it and forget it?
- Set it and forget it.

689
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,580
Ha, ha, oh, my God. Daddy, you
are so thoughtful. Come here.

690
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,183
Ha, ha, oh, I am gonna make
the best chicken for you.

691
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,269
The skin is gonna be so crispy.

692
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,151
- Oh, I love crispy skin.
- It is going to be crispiest skin.

693
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,747
Chicky, chicky, chicky.

694
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,230
Oh, my gosh, I'm just so excited.

695
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,502
I'm gonna go print out
my Internet recipes right beside.

696
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,228
- All right.
- Oh, Matty, your father is something else.

697
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,501
Okay.

698
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,910
- Hey, Matty. What have you been up to?
- What you mean, what are you talking about?

699
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,706
Last couple days I haven't seen you.
What you been doing?

700
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,944
Nothing. Just, like, hanging
out at home and stuff.

701
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,507
- Why are you being so weird?
- I'm not being weird.

702
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,425
You have an intense, crazy guy
look in your eyes right now.

703
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,741
No, I don't.

704
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,227
All right, I'll see you
at practice. I got to run.

705
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,742
- Where do you have to run?
- I'm gonna assume you're joking right now.

706
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,271
You're hilarious.

707
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,904
- And then: boom, boom.
- Yeah.

708
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,907
- You're late.
- Yeah. Sorry, guys. You pumped to sing?

709
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,708
Actually, I might
still need more time.

710
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,631
We don't have very much time Mike.
The audition's in a few days.

711
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,461
- I'm having trouble with these lyrics.
- Dude, it's the Golden Girls theme song.

712
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,266
I mean everyone knows the lyrics
of the Golden Girls theme song. That shit's iconic.

713
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,746
- Ready, Josh?
- Yeah.

714
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,669
Let's go.

715
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,024
<i>Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba</i>

716
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,903
<i>Thank you for being a friend</i>

717
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,306
Sing a little louder, Mike.

718
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,666
<i>Travel down the road</i>

719
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,466
- Can't hear you.
- Can't hear shit.

720
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,822
Dude, let's just sing.

721
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,745
- Come on, Mike.
- No, man. No, no, no. Stop. Stop. Stop.

722
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,706
Look, this is not what we are. We are an
instrumental TV theme song cover band.

723
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,705
- Yeah. We were, until now.
- I wanna play prom, Michael.

724
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,511
I wanna play this song and
I wanna fuck some chicks cause of it.

725
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,750
My fucking is directly
linked to your singing.

726
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,305
Dude, Let's do what we usually do.

727
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,141
Look, there's no way we're gonna win if
we don't do the Golden Girls theme song.

728
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,069
- Now we're all in agreement right guys?
- Fucking A.

729
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,069
- Yeah.
- There you go.

730
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,467
Maybe then we just
shouldn't do it at all.

731
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,181
What are you...?
Are you seriously doing this right now?

732
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,663
Yep. You can't force me
to sing. I'm not a singer.

733
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,388
- Jesus, man. Grow some fucking balls.
- I am. These are my balls.

734
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,229
Me leaving. Those are my balls.

735
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,060
Then I wouldn't sing and we're dicks not even
gonna audition now and it just sucks.

736
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,744
You had a vision.
You stuck to your guns.

737
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,269
My entire life is shit.

738
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,144
- You know I asked Ava to prom?
- No.

739
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,830
- Yep. Yep.
- No.

740
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,227
- She is no longer interested, Michael.
- I know that.

741
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,309
I never should have
broken up with her.

742
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,465
She's got the face of an angel.
The body of an angel.

743
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,470
She is like an angel that you
really wanna have sex with.

744
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,267
Yeah, I wouldn't feel that bad.
She's not really an angel.

745
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,508
Yeah, she is.

746
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,830
I'm gonna tell you something
because I want you to feel like...

747
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,506
you can just really get over her.

748
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,702
- Okay?
- Okay

749
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:34,786
Ava was hooking up with Anthony
before you broke up with her.

750
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,908
- What?
- She was cheating on you.

751
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,110
Damn it.

752
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,829
Damn it. Well, at least
she's super uptight...

753
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,706
and, you know, she won't let
anyone get past second base.

754
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,621
Yeah, she wasn't that
uptight with Anthony.

755
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,027
What? Did she have sex with him?

756
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,020
I'm sorry.

757
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,671
No. Thanks for telling me.

758
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,831
They also had anal sex.

759
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,710
- What?
- No, I'm just kidding.

760
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,501
I just thought that would make you feel
better about the regular sex thing.

761
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,508
- That actually kind of worked.
- You're welcome.

762
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,830
Yeah.

763
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,703
I'm never gonna touch
another girl again.

764
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,390
- Here we go.
- I am so mediocre.

765
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,146
You're not that mediocre.

766
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,191
Heh, you're gonna be fine.

767
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,064
Ava is my friend, I think.

768
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,585
But even when you guys were going out,
I don't think she ever really appreciated...

769
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,191
what she had with you...

770
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,669
as much as someone who you
deserve even better, I think.

771
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,465
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

772
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,904
You want to go for a drive?

773
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,984
Okay.

774
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,423
I can't believe we go
to the same place.

775
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,311
What do you mean? I've been
going there since I was a kid.

776
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:11,341
Well, it's just boys go to barbers
and girls go to, like, stylists.

777
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,867
- Really?
- Isn't that...? That's how barbering works.

778
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,188
What? Does my hair
really look that bad?

779
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,950
No. It looks great. It's, like,
lustrous. It's like a horse's mane.

780
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,189
- In a good way. Yeah.
- Thanks.

781
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,066
No, I just didn't know that Giovanni had
this ability. He's, like, 100 years old.

782
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,187
Giovanni is the best and I'm proud
to be his only female client.

783
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,111
Okay? So here, imaginary
cheers to Giovanni, clink.

784
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,507
To Giovanni.

785
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,631
He's here.

786
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,907
What?

787
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,829
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

788
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,261
I'm making out with a dude.
What does it look like I'm doing?

789
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,268
But why do you have to do gay stuff
with the asshole who hit my car?

790
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,066
He's actually a really good guy.

791
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,740
That was a really rough
night for me, I'm sorry.

792
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,303
And what are you doing here with
my ex-girlfriend? That's a little bit weird.

793
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,264
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm Greg.

794
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,428
- I'm Em.
- Not a thing. We're just having...

795
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,543
We're just... We're
having a chitchat here.

796
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,708
Two friends talking?
What's the big deal?

797
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,551
And what does it even matter
if you're gay anyway?

798
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,108
- Um, it's the principle of it.
- This why you're avoiding me?

799
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,462
You've been hanging out a
lot with, uh, Gay-ass Greg?

800
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:04,588
Yeah, maybe not Gay-ass Greg.
Maybe just Gay Greg or even Greg.

801
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,790
Um, yeah, dude, actually we have
been hanging out quite a bit.

802
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,541
To be 100 percent honest, you've been
so fucking weird about all this shit...

803
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,903
that I don't know if I wanna
hang out with you 24/7 anymore you know.

804
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,428
Look, man, deal with
your own shit for once.

805
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,703
Take control of your life and
stop focusing so much on mine.

806
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,784
I'm starting to miss
straight Matty.

807
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,711
Straight Matty never would have
snuck around behind my back.

808
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,664
Wake up. I was never straight.

809
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,703
Like I don't need this
pressure from you, man.

810
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,871
Like, I don't need to get laid
by prom or any of that shit.

811
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,547
- What about the brownie?
- I don't wanna eat your shitty brownie.

812
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,471
Don't talk about the
brownie like that.

813
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,870
Bro, seriously, chill
out about the brownie.

814
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,667
<i>I'm not Superman
I'm not Spiderman</i>

815
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,625
<i>I'm just trying to
be the best I can</i>

816
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:59,589
<i>So let me be a hero for your heart.</i>

817
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,749
<i>You're the only one for me
You lift me up, you set me free</i>

818
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,980
<i>I'll never leave you
standing all alone</i>

819
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,111
Moments of Memory forever!

820
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,347
Yeah?

821
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,786
Uh, I got a new DVD in the mail today.
A TV show called <i>The L Word.</i>

822
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,627
I thought maybe we could
watch it together.

823
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,221
Uh, yeah, maybe later. I'm
gonna go skate right now.

824
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,064
I have some stuff to think about.

825
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,143
All right, let me know if
you ever wanna talk more.

826
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,463
Or if you wanna talk less.
I don't wanna smother you.

827
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,230
- You're not.
- Well, good.

828
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:59,029
I know life seems complicated sometimes,
but I usually find it gets simpler...

829
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,066
if you just focus on the things
that have always made you happy.

830
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,909
Yo.

831
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,224
Yeah.

832
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,746
Hey, man.
Thanks for coming.

833
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,590
Of course, man.

834
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,942
What's up? What made
you think of coming here for the first place?

835
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,830
- Go-karts. We love go-karts.
- True.

836
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,867
I always find that things get simpler
if you just focus on the things...

837
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,421
that have always made you happy.

838
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,226
Oh, cool. Cool.

839
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,981
When was the last time we came here?
Like, uh, 6 years ago?

840
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,420
- Yeah.
- What did the guy say?

841
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,349
Used to kicked us out and
used to say something.

842
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,542
- "What did I tell you about bumping?"
- Heh.

843
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,111
No bumping, man!"

844
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,144
"If you come back here,
I'm gonna call the cops!"

845
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,941
- It's the same guy.
- Oh, heh.

846
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,983
You'd think he would
have moved on by now.

847
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,103
You think he remembers us?
No way, dude.

848
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,268
We were 12 when he last saw us.

849
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,140
Hey. Two, please.

850
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,430
Go sit in there. Starting the
safety instruction seminar.

851
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,625
So, what exactly can you do to
avoid being brutally mutilated...

852
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,106
on the racetrack today?

853
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,109
That's a dark way to
start the session.

854
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:35,024
I've seen these things crush people's feet.
I've seen them tear off people's fingers.

855
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,461
Once saw a little girl get
her hair stuck in the motor.

856
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,387
Bye-bye, scalp.

857
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,509
Does it have to do with bumping?

858
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:52,550
No bumping. Bumping is a one-way
ticket to injury land, U.S.A.

859
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,471
And if the carts don't
injure you, I will.

860
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,425
I will come out there and
punch you in the face...

861
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,827
so you don't injure any
of our other drivers.

862
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,824
That's how much
I care about the rest of you.

863
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,222
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this straight.

864
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,027
- We should or we shouldn't bump?
- Looks like we got ourselves a comedian.

865
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,144
Well, let me ask you this,
Mr. Comedian. Is this hilarious?

866
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,944
- It's kind of funny.
- Go-kart accident!

867
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,587
Stuttgart, Germany, 2007.

868
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,664
Doesn't even look like a real leg.

869
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,990
It's not real. It's a mock-up that I made
because no one took photos that day.

870
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,104
- Makes sense.
- You bump once, I kick you the F out.

871
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,709
You bump twice, what happens?
Trick question. You can't bump twice...

872
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,870
because if you bump once I've
already kicked your ass out...

873
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,870
and you're at home sitting
on your couch alone...

874
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,186
watching the Food Network,
wishing you hadn't bumped.

875
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,426
Whoo!

876
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,269
Hey! Keep your hands on the wheel!

877
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,029
Put your legs back in the cart!
This is your last warning.

878
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,826
- Get over here!
- Why, hello, old friend.

879
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,182
Would you like to partake
in some light bumping this afternoon?

880
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,428
I would say that we should
definitely do that.

881
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,186
Okay, then. We should bump.

882
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,710
Gonna bump the shit out of you!

883
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,506
You're done, bro!

884
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,663
No bumping! No bumping!

885
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,061
I remember you motherfuckers.

886
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,986
You used to bumped more than anyone, I told
you never to come back here. You're dead!

887
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,590
- Why didn't we just run to our cars?
- I don't know. I just panicked.

888
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,784
- Yeah, me too. He was fucking pissed.
- Yeah.

889
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,221
He was more pissed than
I've ever seen him before. Like it says a lot.

890
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,748
- I don't think we can go back there for 10 years.
- No way.

891
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,147
Dude, I'm sorry about
saying all that...

892
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,708
Like, all that stuff wishing you
were straight and all that.

893
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,508
Oh, it's okay, man. I'm sorry that
I said your brownie was shitty.

894
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,226
Oh, no. I know that.
It's not. It's amazing. So...

895
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,549
- Yeah.
- It's actually still in the freezer...

896
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,147
by the way. You think
this Greg guy is the one?

897
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,661
- He could be your brownie guy.
- Man, I don't know.

898
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,181
- Have you touched his balls yet?
- Come on.

899
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,509
- You like balls. You're a ball guy.
- I never said that.

900
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,431
- You said that.
- I think you made that up, actually.

901
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,190
- Yeah, yeah. I did do that.
- Yeah.

902
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,105
What about you, man?
What do you got going on?

903
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,422
Me? I got...

904
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,861
I actually got someone
I'm thinking about.

905
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,221
Nice.

906
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,141
Are you...? You're not...?
You're over Em, right?

907
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,501
You're... I mean...

908
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,031
- Dude.
- What?

909
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,661
- Seriously?
- What? Dude, You're seriously gonna do this?

910
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,181
You're gonna call dibs even
after you've broken up...

911
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,860
and you're not into persons
with her sexual organs?

912
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,860
No, I'm not calling dibs. I mean, I just...
Like, I feel like it's weird, you know?

913
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,540
- Tell me it's not weird.
- It's not weird.

914
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,862
- It's not weird.
- I think it's a little weird.

915
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,664
- All right.
- I'm gonna go.

916
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,305
I'm meeting up with Greg a little bit...

917
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,747
- ...but this was super fun.
- Good to see you, man.

918
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,705
- Great to see you, man.
- Well, what if I call dibs on Greg?

919
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,180
- That makes no sense.
- No. I'll see you later, brother.

920
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,467
All right.

921
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,630
Actually, I'm parked
over there too.

922
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,030
- Yeah, that's happening.
- So she's not an angel.

923
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,062
- Okay. Let's go.
- Yep.

924
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,589
- Thanks for hanging out with me...
- Heh.

925
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,426
...and dealing with
my shit recently.

926
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,824
- It's been fun.
- Yeah, it's been fun for me too.

927
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,262
Why is this the only spot
that people drive up to?

928
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,629
Because it's Glen Ellen.

929
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:04,781
This abandoned construction lot is
the most romantic place in town.

930
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,468
So you brought us here
because it's romantic?

931
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,901
Oh, yes, I did. I did.

932
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,508
Those beautiful Porta-Potties
and the broken glass...

933
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,750
and used condoms really just
get me right in the mood.

934
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,460
Heh, that's good.

935
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,663
Wait, Michael, I need
to tell you something.

936
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,271
What?

937
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,186
After Matty and I broke up,
we hooked up one more time.

938
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,027
When?

939
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,550
After you guys went to that club.

940
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,831
And we...

941
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,821
We had sex.

942
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,501
- What?
- Yeah.

943
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,829
- You what? You, what...?
- Yeah.

944
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:09,662
Heh, I know. I was drunk and we
both had really weird nights.

945
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,669
- How can that happen?
- It just did.

946
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,942
Wha...? He's gay. He's gay.

947
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,861
Well, you're not the only one in the
world with confused feelings, Michael.

948
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,471
I'm not... I'm not confused.

949
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,708
I definitely wouldn't
have sex with a gay guy.

950
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,710
- Okay, now you're just being an asshole.
- You're an asshole.

951
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,149
- I can't do this.
- Michael.

952
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,424
Michael.

953
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,584
Shit.

954
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,788
- Oh, hey, Michael.
- Oh, is Matty home?

955
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,309
Yeah, he sure is. We're just getting ready
to sit down to dinner. You wanna join us?

956
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,547
Yes, I would.

957
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,942
Okay, great. Well, come on in.
What you got there?

958
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,347
This is a private thing.

959
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,624
Oh, mmm.

960
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,101
Mom, this chicken's incredible.
The skin is so, like...

961
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,421
- Crispy?
- Crispy.

962
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,748
Right, you're damned right it is.

963
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:36,150
That is the Ronco Showtime
Rotisserie doing its thing.

964
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,150
- It's just fucking great.
- Lars, language, please.

965
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,149
- Oh, this is a great meal.
- Heh.

966
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,785
And all because of a great gift.

967
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,466
<i>- Are you okay?
- I hate you.</i>

968
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:50,666
Why don't we thank your mother by going around the
table saying what our favorite part of the meal? I'll go first.

969
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:56,226
The chicken, but more
specifically, the skin.

970
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,026
- How did I know you were gonna say that?
- Lars?

971
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,585
- Skin.
- Ha, ha.

972
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,147
- Matty?
- Oh, yeah, skin.

973
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,631
Pat?

974
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,160
- Michael?
- My favorite part of this meal...

975
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,747
is how Matty fucked a girl...

976
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,625
Ha, ha.
Michael, language.

977
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,187
Well, that's not really the
answer to the question.

978
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,866
I am kind of curious.
Is that true, Matty?

979
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,583
I'm sorry, can I, uh, pleased be excused to
speak with Michael in the other room?

980
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,263
- Well, we are having a family dinner.
- Why don't you let them talk it out?

981
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,661
Dwayne. Dwayne, ask him.

982
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,351
- Dude, What the fuck?
- You had sex with Em.

983
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,947
- So what?
- So I like her a lot.

984
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,520
- She was my girlfriend.
- You're gay.

985
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,270
Shh, shut up.

986
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,549
You don't deserve her. You
don't deserve any girl.

987
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,787
Why did you do that?

988
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,427
Why are you even at my house?
What the fuck are you doing here?

989
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,347
You're gay.

990
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,783
I need you to shut up for the rest
of dinner. Can you please do that for me?

991
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,347
What? You don't like that movie?

992
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,463
I don't believe it.
When you're married...

993
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,707
- Hi, Matty.
- Hello.

994
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,987
Welcome back.

995
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:15,185
Okay, boys. Family meal.
Anything going on with you two?

996
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,344
Yeah, a lot, actually.

997
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,703
Today was a crazy day at PacSun.
We got these huge new shipments in.

998
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,461
I had tons and tons of board shorts, so
I took a look at the different styles.

999
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,668
And I said to Laurie,
I said, "Laurie..."

1000
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,750
I will sell all of these
laced-up board shorts today.

1001
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,622
"Not this week, today."

1002
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,948
And she was like,
"Yeah, right, Lars. No way."

1003
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,667
And by the end of the day, get this,
Dad, I sold all of the lace-ups...

1004
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,943
and some of the non lace-ups.
So I was like, "Suck it, Laurie."

1005
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,626
Don't say "suck it." But fantastic.
Great work, son.

1006
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,265
Very ambitious, just like your dad.

1007
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,782
I got something else that I
really want to share with you guys.

1008
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,309
First off, I wanna thank you for
keeping me so humble on this journey.

1009
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,107
I know it's been tough, but something
really great happened to me today.

1010
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,347
<i>You are an asshole.</i>

1011
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,623
I just found out my band,
we're playing the prom.

1012
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,711
- Matty's gay.
- That is great. Congratulations.

1013
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,860
- Daddy?
- Wait. What did you say?

1014
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,107
- Nothing.
- Matty's gay.

1015
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,109
- Shut the fuck up Michael.
- Language, mind...

1016
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,547
- What is he talking about?
- Matty is a gay guy, You have a gay son.

1017
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,583
- Oh, language.
- Gay is not a bad word.

1018
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,862
Debatable. Everyone
just cut the bullshit.

1019
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,744
What is going on?

1020
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,989
It's a milestone in my musical
career, Dad, is what's going on.

1021
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,666
- Matthew.
- Matty, is this true?

1022
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,750
- No.
- Matthew, answer your mother.

1023
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,711
- I said no.
- He's not gay.

1024
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,987
No.

1025
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,309
Why don't you excuse yourself to
your room and I will meet you there?

1026
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,867
- Michael, this dinner is over right now.
- Fine.

1027
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,347
- Seriously?
- You heard me.

1028
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,909
It's gonna be awesome. I know it's the
prom but I think I can get you two in.

1029
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,826
<i>1, 2, 3, 4!</i>

1030
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,949
- Did you out Matty to his parents?
- Hold on.

1031
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,905
- Did you tell them that he's gay?
- It's complicated.

1032
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,501
Did you think for a second
about what that meant to him?

1033
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,987
- Let me explain.
- Do you have any idea what's happening to him right now?

1034
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,348
- Wait.
- He was your best friend, Michael.

1035
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,908
Your best friend.

1036
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,111
You are a terrible person.

1037
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,740
Oh! Damn, dude.

1038
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,981
This looks good, right?

1039
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,829
- It is perfect. I think we're good to go.
- Cool.

1040
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,224
This is totally not my business, but
I thought you really liked that guy.

1041
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,627
Yeah, I just can't do that anymore.

1042
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,700
Him specifically or...?

1043
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,261
Just all of it.

1044
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,949
Matthew, we found the most darling
cuff links. They're little pigs.

1045
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,303
- Why would I want those, Mom?
- I'm sorry, I gave you the wrong jacket.

1046
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,854
Let me get you the right one.

1047
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,365
Well, get this off.
It's two sizes too small.

1048
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,030
Silly, heh.

1049
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,789
There we go.

1050
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,027
Uh-oh.

1051
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,103
Yes, yes, yes. Now you
look good enough to eat.

1052
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,106
Yes, heh. Very handsome.

1053
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,302
Oh, Matthew.

1054
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,629
This reminds me of your dad
when we went to our prom.

1055
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,830
You went to the prom with your
husband and you're still together?

1056
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,230
- We sure are, 32 years.
- Congratulations.

1057
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,788
I wish I could say the same, but old
Linda is still playing the field.

1058
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,700
That's okay. It's fun
being single. Live it up.

1059
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,345
32 years? Wow, maybe
you can give me some advice.

1060
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,107
I'm dating a Colombian man.

1061
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,310
We have very little in common.
We hardly understand each other but...

1062
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,582
the sex is really amazing.

1063
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,503
He's only willing to see me on Tuesdays.
Now, what is that about?

1064
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,226
- It might be a, uh, cultural thing?
- Well, then there's Gene.

1065
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,548
Gene's very bright, he's
got a skin condition...

1066
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,621
but that's not a deal-breaker for me.
And the sex is ridiculous.

1067
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,182
- What do I do?
- High school prom, we're getting fitted for.

1068
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:56,944
And then there's Claude. He's 5'6", he
owns a sailboat and he's my mailman.

1069
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,220
The sex is amazing, but
only on the sailboat.

1070
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,942
You know, when it's rocky?

1071
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,620
But I think that's because
Claude is a little lazy.

1072
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,424
What do I do?

1073
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,191
I'm not even really sure
what we're talking about at this point.

1074
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,587
You're not kidding.
Relationships are hard.

1075
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:19,263
They are complicated. Although you two
kids seem to have it figured out, right?

1076
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,987
- You look so cute together.
- Yes, we do. We got it all figured out.

1077
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,910
Oh, hello.

1078
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,062
I gotta go help this hot
number. Wish me luck.

1079
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,307
Welcome.

1080
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,185
She is a live wire, heh.

1081
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,946
But she's right. You two kids make
the most adorable couple, heh.

1082
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,067
Matthew, look at you.

1083
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,981
You're going to the prom with
the most beautiful girl.

1084
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,670
Yes.

1085
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,911
Beautiful girl, prom,
we're doing it.

1086
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,346
I have to go to the bathroom.

1087
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,024
Matthew.

1088
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,226
- Is anything the matter?
- No.

1089
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,631
Okay, well, you know that you can
always come to me to talk, right?

1090
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,386
- About anything. Anything at all.
- Yeah.

1091
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,222
- You tell me, okay?
- Everything's great, Mom.

1092
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,224
Michael, I don't wanna tell you how
to live your life, but it's 4 p.m.

1093
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,783
You haven't left the house
except to go to school for days.

1094
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,264
Okay.

1095
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,264
This time I'm not taking no for
an answer, mister. Sit up.

1096
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,466
You look at me and you
talk to me. Now.

1097
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,346
What's wrong?

1098
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,784
It's just...

1099
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,220
why can't things stay the same?

1100
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,744
Do you remember when
your mom and I split up?

1101
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,351
- Yeah.
- What happened?

1102
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,063
You cried and built a
lot of birdhouses.

1103
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,303
And then what happened?

1104
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,348
You took me to Disney
World for 2 weeks...

1105
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,542
and even I thought it was too long.

1106
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,905
And then what happened?

1107
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,142
You became friends with Mom again.

1108
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,582
- And why do you think we did that?
- For me?

1109
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,191
No.

1110
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,267
We did it because we loved each other
very much, and that's a rare thing.

1111
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,580
History is a powerful
thing, Michael.

1112
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,591
Home is a powerful thing.

1113
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,589
No more sleeping until 4.

1114
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,662
What's up, daddy longlegs?
What are you doing here?

1115
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,784
I just needed a drink and, uh,
I knew this place would let me in.

1116
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,903
I hear that.

1117
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:42,589
- Are you crying, man?
- No, dude, but close.

1118
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,910
How are things with you and Matty?

1119
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,904
Yeah, uh...

1120
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,144
Matty is not answering
my calls as of late.

1121
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,183
What? Why?

1122
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,184
I mean, I get it.

1123
01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:00,068
It's not easy to come out of the
closet and then stay there, you know?

1124
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,430
When I came out in high school, my best friend...

1125
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,869
he basically disowned me. And
he was a water polo player.

1126
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,667
It's the faggiest sport there is. I mean,
those guys, they wax their assholes.

1127
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,831
When I came out, my best friend
stopped sharing sodas with me...

1128
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,342
stopped giving me rides to school,
de-friended me on Facebook...

1129
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,508
and then moved to Germany.

1130
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,183
The moving part was unrelated
to me coming out. He claims.

1131
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,545
Yeah, I don't wanna be one of those
guys. I've been just a huge jerk.

1132
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,064
- Have you talked to Matty about it?
- I tried to, he won't talk to me.

1133
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,583
Maybe you need to try a little harder.
Maybe you need to find out where he's gonna be.

1134
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,387
You need to corner him and make
him hear what you have to say.

1135
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,111
Boom.

1136
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,383
So this is it.

1137
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,189
This is it. Prom.

1138
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,945
Whoo!

1139
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,422
Could you guys get a
little closer together?

1140
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,347
Closer.

1141
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,463
- Closer.
- Really? Okay.

1142
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,021
Perfect.

1143
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,384
Okay.

1144
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,746
So far, so good.

1145
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,584
- Really?
- Yeah.

1146
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,424
Hey, Matty.

1147
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,743
What do you think you're doing?

1148
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,745
Dude.

1149
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,789
Wow.

1150
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,302
Michael, did you bring a
bearded dude to prom...

1151
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,589
or am I just, like, ripped out
of my fucking mind right now?

1152
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,989
Both. Uh, this is Greg.

1153
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,548
Cheers, buddy.

1154
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,904
<i>Gonna shine my light

1155

<i>Yeah, I'm not Superman
I'm not Spider-Man</i>

1156
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,504

1157
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,467
<i>So let me be a hero for your heart</i>

1158
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,583
- You okay?
- No.

1159
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:47,867
- Nervous?
- Yes.

1160
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,471
It's okay.

1161
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,070
- I'm gonna shit myself.
- Not gonna shit yourself. You look good.

1162
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,587
You can do it.

1163
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,661
Go, come on. Go, go, go.

1164
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,349
Hey, Lars. Lars. I gotta do
something important right now.

1165
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,510
- It'll take 5 minutes.
- No can do, Mikey. We're destroying it.

1166
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,464
- This is our moment.
- I know. Please.

1167
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,469
- Get the fuck off the stage.
- Yeah.

1168
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,028
Hey, potty mouth. You get off the
stage or I'm cutting the power off.

1169
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,587
- Shit, it's the principal.
- Go.

1170
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,102
Don't kill our momentum, bro.

1171
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,747
Thanks.

1172
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,586
Hey, everybody.

1173
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,269
I, uh, I'm sorry to
interrupt your prom.

1174
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,028
I just wanted to sing a song...

1175
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,105
if you don't mind.

1176
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,150
This song is about
dealing with change...

1177
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,261
which I am not very good at. Um...

1178
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,468
I've done a lot of stupid things the
last couple of months and, um...

1179
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:12,467
Uh, yeah, I think I'm
learning to be better at it.

1180
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,188
So here we go.

1181
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:27,941
<i>When I was born,

1182
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,145
<i>Soon I'll be dancing
on a different stage</i>

1183
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:37,022
<i>I'll go to sleep
inside a silk cocoon</i>

1184
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:43,747
<i>And be reborn into the afternoon</i>

1185
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:49,191
<i>When I have wings
I'll fly into the sun</i>

1186
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,862
<i>Up in the sky I'll be the only one</i>

1187
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,951
<i>Deep down I know
I have to turn the page</i>

1188
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,269
<i>But I wonder</i>

1189
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,226
<i>Will I miss my legs?</i>

1190
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,067
<i>Will I miss my legs?</i>

1191
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,621
Gay!

1192
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,342
- Were you talking about me or the song?
- You!

1193
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,465
Okay, good, actually, uh...

1194
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,630
because that ties into something
else I wanted to mention...

1195
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,989
while I'm up here, that
even though I'm not gay...

1196
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,947
I'm a straight man, I brought
a guy to prom tonight.

1197
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,700
Really cool guy.

1198
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,825
I did that because ...

1199
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,500
it shouldn't matter
who you bring to prom...

1200
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,671
and it shouldn't matter who
you're attracted to in life...

1201
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,582
or who you fall in love with. Just
bring whoever you want to prom.

1202
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,863
And as for the gay thing...

1203
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,424
gay people are just people who have
sex a little bit differently...

1204
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,268
and I'm sure that it
still feels amazing.

1205
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,670
So yeah, call me gay. I don't care.
Doesn't bother me one bit.

1206
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,947
Gay!

1207
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,391
Okay, well, I got through
to you, then, I guess.

1208
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,783
So, uh, thank you
guys for listening.

1209
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,948
Enjoy your prom.

1210
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,742
That took big King
Kong-sized donkey balls.

1211
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,227
- Thanks. Thank you.
- You got it.

1212
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,141
- Hey, man. Are you sure you're not gay?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

1213
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,310
Because a lot of people are gonna
think you're gay after tonight.

1214
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,150
I know. It's okay.

1215
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,946
Oh, man. I let her out of
my sight for one second.

1216
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,950
Check it out. Here comes Ava.
She's gonna be so pissed.

1217
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,824
Oh.

1218
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:14,106
- Okay, that girl is a freak.
- I need some air.

1219
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,470
Hey.

1220
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,947
Hey.

1221
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,705
Hey.

1222
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,950
Hey.

1223
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,344
I liked what you said up there.

1224
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:34,908
Um, it's not enough. It doesn't
make up for everything.

1225
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,625
It's a start.

1226
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,546
I know I was, like,
super weird in there earlier.

1227
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,750
But, uh, I'm really
glad to see you here.

1228
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,264
It's good to see you too.

1229
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,509
Even if it is at a prom,
because they are terrible.

1230
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,748
- Heh.
- A prom is like one gigantic shitty wedding...

1231
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,590
between 500 idiotic teenagers.

1232
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,828
Yeah, it's bad.

1233
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,785
The first day when we were
talking about Matty coming out?

1234
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,121
I should've gotten him that
cake that said, "You're gay."

1235
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,946
It would have been better than
all the stupid stuff I did.

1236
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,184
There's still time, you know.
There's a bakery right around the corner...

1237
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,465
- ...that specializes in gay apology cakes.
- Really? Where is it?

1238
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,185
- Just kidding.
- Heh.

1239
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,064
I know you're fucking
with me this time.

1240
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,470
- Always fucking with me.
- I'm sorry that I stopped calling you.

1241
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,823
- I'm really sorry for freaking out on you.
- Don't be sorry.

1242
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,422
And if there's anything that I can
do to help you, you let me know.

1243
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,625
You're doing it right now.

1244
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,744
- Think we could ever hang out again?
- Yeah, I'd like that.

1245
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,548
Actually, I have to go do
one more thing tonight.

1246
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,186
Something I need to do
before this all thing gets wrapped up.

1247
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,384
- Good luck.
- Go.

1248
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,261
Yo.

1249
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,908
- You leaving already?
- No.

1250
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,829
I, uh, was just gonna grab
this and then find you.

1251
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:49,981
- Heh, you brought the brownie to prom?
- I bring it everywhere. It's like my baby.

1252
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,224
I'm sorry about all the stuff I did.
I actually brought this here tonight...

1253
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,986
because I want you and I
to get rid of this together.

1254
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,909
This brownie represents
the old me...

1255
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,580
who was just afraid things
wouldn't stay the same...

1256
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,421
and that we wouldn't be the same kind of friends anymore.
I know it's stupid, but that's how I felt.

1257
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,702
So you and I need to destroy
this thing tonight.

1258
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,902
- Fuck, no.
- What?

1259
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,031
This brownie is fucking beautiful, okay?
And what you said tonight on-stage...

1260
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,029
that was... Dude,
that was so awesome.

1261
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,460
- Heh.
- Yeah.

1262
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,742
I think I'm gonna come
out to my parents.

1263
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,425
- Really?
- Yeah.

1264
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,146
I mean, I think it's
gonna be all right.

1265
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,308
That is great, man.

1266
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:32,110
- So are we gonna eat this thing or what?
- Right now?

1267
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,861
Yeah, I mean, it's amazing. I mean,
look at the artistry on all these dicks.

1268
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,782
- You frosted veins on this one shaft.
- I used a pastry bag with a special nozzle.

1269
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,870
And this one over here,
the pubes are gorgeous.

1270
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,461
- I wanna put the pubes in my mouth.
- You love pubes?

1271
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,742
- You're goddamn right I love pubes.
- Cool.

1272
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,465
I love this brownie.

1273
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,062
And I love you, in a
totally non-gay way.

1274
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,866
- Well, I love you too, non-gay.
- Let's bring it in.

1275
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,589
- Oh, man.
- Non-gay.

1276
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,147
Extremely non-gay, not
interested at all.

1277
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,301
- What are you doing?
- I'm picking you up.

1278
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,027
- Put me down.
- Don't punch me, you know I'm sensitive.

1279
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,301
Hey.

1280
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,585
- They're okay.
- Is this the, uh, famous brownie?

1281
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,861
How old is this thing?

1282
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,462
Oh, super old, but I kept it
in the freezer, so it's cool.

1283
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,381
And I only poured beer on it a
couple times and I cried on it once.

1284
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,344
That's cool.

1285
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,111
Is there enough for 4?

1286
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:40,590
Oh, my God, I'm so high.

1287
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,350
What should we do now?

1288
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:46,147
I mean, we cannot go back
into prom like this.

1289
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:52,108
There's only one place you can
go when you're this high.

1290
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,585
This is the best night of my life!
