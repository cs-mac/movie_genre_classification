1
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,971
I can't believe you're moving.
Where is Vancouver, anyway?

2
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,746
Do you know what happens to girls who
start high school with no best friend,

3
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,913
no guy, and low social standing?

4
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,822
Nothing.
Nothing ever happens to them.

5
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,284
But look at it this way... you have
the whole summer to revise your image.

6
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,093
I never truly had an image, did I?

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,599
Start now.

8
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,505
Bye!

9
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,777
See you, guys!

10
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,683
Julie, Hannah, hold on.
Take this. Here. There you go.

11
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,419
What's this? I thought we were
done with junior high.

12
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,087
It's the summer reading list.

13
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,926
You read all these books?

14
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,260
Yeah, many times.

15
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,392
Really, Mr. Corrado,
you need to get out more.

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,965
Okay, that's not funny!

17
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,903
You two, slow down!

18
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,339
Julie, party problem.

19
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,006
Great. Staci's gonna go
to Liz's sleepover.

20
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,415
Speak of the devils.

21
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,950
Hey, Yancy,
my father's a lawyer.

22
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,513
He could help you sue the diet pill
company for nonperformance.

23
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,530
Do you want to come
to my sleepover?

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,262
Me? Yeah, sure.
Absolutely.

25
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,305
- It's tonight. Seven-ish.
- Cool.

26
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,905
Last chance to see
a picture of me in a coma.

27
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,848
I've got tubes in nasty places.

28
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,216
You were barely in a coma.

29
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,118
Three hours.

30
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,151
Hey, hey, what's this?
Someone having a par-tay tonight?

31
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,492
Par-tay, Jules!

32
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,999
Keep it up, SpongeBob. You'll have
two pictures of yourself in a coma.

33
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,904
Jules, I can't make your overnighter.
I'm doing the dance.

34
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,537
The dance?

35
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,514
The high school dance?

36
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,411
Oh, right. Have fun.

37
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,477
"Have fun"!

38
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,082
How did Staci get so popular, anyways?

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,957
We used to be best friends.

40
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,962
That was elementary school.

41
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,019
True.

42
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,795
So, I think I have a solution.

43
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,301
I'll just move with you.

44
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,498
You have to stay put, kiddo,
hold up the tent.

45
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,002
The tent won't be
the same without you.

46
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,043
So this is our future?

47
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,706
Your future.

48
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,443
I still can't believe you're moving.

49
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,213
How am I supposed to
do high school without you?

50
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,647
There it is...

51
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,783
the high school lunch spot.

52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,260
And there's
where I'll be sitting.

53
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,095
Cool...

54
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,225
uncool.

55
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,260
Staci and Liz...

56
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,030
me.

57
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,768
Life is so predictable it kills me.

58
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,455
Steve is so plush.

59
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,129
Isn't it great?
He can't see me, not at all.

60
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,618
I thought you'd never get home.

61
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,355
We have a million things to do
before the party, Julie,

62
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:27,991
so I stopped on my way home
and I bought all the stuff.

63
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,433
Stuff? What stuff?

64
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,368
Oh, Mom, not the Party Playhouse!

65
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,672
We are having a ladybug party.

66
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,210
We've got ladybug cups...

67
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,840
ladybug plates...

68
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,978
and a ladybug pi? Ata.

69
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,648
Mom, I'm 14, not 4.

70
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,886
I just thought your party should
have a theme, like they used to.

71
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,622
Aren't these antenna boppers
just a hoot, Hannah?

72
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,685
Look.

73
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,599
Someone stole my bike.

74
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,227
What happened to his car?

75
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,295
Repossessed.

76
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,603
We're all so proud.

77
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,008
Maybe I should stay home tonight.

78
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,171
No. Bad, Mom. You can't.

79
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,305
And why not?

80
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,941
Because we don't need
a babysitter.

81
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,350
Besides, Dad'll be here.
He's a great enforcer.

82
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,252
Slumber house rules.

83
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,224
Oh, for the love of carbs,
do we have to...

84
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,759
Slumber house rules.

85
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,124
"No leaving the house,

86
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,722
no boys,
no damaging important stuff."

87
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,131
If there's any structural damage
to this house...

88
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,226
So, is this the part
where you break into song?

89
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,793
Honey, you ignore the house rules,

90
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,862
you will stay home with your grandma
and help her sort wigs

91
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,738
while the rest of us go to Hawaii...
without you.

92
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,243
Are you serious?

93
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,907
You would take that
and leave me?

94
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,415
That, who is supposed to be at college

95
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,180
setting a good example
for his younger sister?

96
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,417
Yeah, well, college...

97
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,017
Everyone was so serious.

98
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,962
High school was great.

99
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,828
Stay as long as you can.

100
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:12,033
Please... please tell me
we have different fathers!

101
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,005
Julie, enough.
Go to your room.

102
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,405
Ren, go to your former room.

103
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,467
And you, outside.

104
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,814
My mom is so blindfolded.

105
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,051
Look at what she bought me.

106
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,021
Now, those are hot.

107
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,683
She seriously thinks
I'm, like, 10 or something.

108
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,219
Can I borrow five bucks?

109
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,992
- Can you knock?
- Actually, I need 20.

110
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,364
Can I borrow 50 bucks?

111
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,404
Get a job.
Or better, go back to school!

112
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,275
I am blooming!
I need a lock on my door!

113
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,444
Hey. What's going on?

114
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,145
Fried Twinkies.

115
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,719
I wish I'd invented these. Wow.

116
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,759
Honey, I feel so guilty leaving you
alone with the party tonight.

117
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,157
Are you sure this is okay?

118
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,889
Have fun, and while
you're gone, my love...

119
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,194
I'm installing
the Aquapure system.

120
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,134
Oh, honey, why don't you just
relax tonight? Our water's fine.

121
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,604
Fine? Fine?
Let's just take a look at our water.

122
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,537
Blue! Blue, okay?

123
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,273
Know what that means?

124
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,281
Our house is having a boy?

125
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,180
I'll tell you what,

126
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,242
I don't know what it means,
but I'm gonna find out,

127
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,016
and I know it's not good,
it's not good for any of us.

128
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,517
Okey-dokey. Well.

129
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,117
I'm going now.

130
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,163
Behave.

131
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,289
Right.

132
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,061
Go! Be merry!
Have fun, okay?

133
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,500
All right.
Now, have a good time.

134
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,060
And keep the music down, okay?

135
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,232
I'm finally back on speaking terms
with the Mulligans, okay?

136
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,297
Mom, go.

137
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,673
What do you think
they do for fun?

138
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,080
My mother doesn't do fun.

139
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,879
Butt crack alert.

140
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,948
Party!

141
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,161
You're wearing that to the dance?

142
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,697
We're skipping the dance.

143
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,461
Skipping the dance?

144
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,574
This is where we're going
instead of the dance?

145
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,106
I spent all month
getting ready for this dance.

146
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,616
That's pathetic.

147
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,847
Come here.

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,148
Stop it!

149
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,451
You're crushing my Lulu Guinness.

150
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,515
Maybe I should have
asked her out.

151
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,458
Come on.

152
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,788
You promised. You promised when
you graduated, we would hook up.

153
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,130
And you promised
to take me to the dance.

154
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,397
Get off me!

155
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,460
Out!

156
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,632
- What?
- Get out. We're over.

157
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,971
Really?

158
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,944
Yeah, really.
Have you forgotten who I am?

159
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,708
Let me think.

160
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,308
The second-string quarterback...
on the junior varsity.

161
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,121
You'll be so ruined in high school.

162
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,642
Liz? Change in plan.
I can't get you guys into the dance.

163
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,081
Calm yourself.
I have new funness in mind.

164
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,815
Start making a list.

165
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,646
Hi, two large pepperoni,

166
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,588
two with pineapple and barbecue,
and one with...

167
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,421
- Anchovies!
- That is so rank!

168
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,256
The dead little stinky fish.

169
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,659
Okay, thanks.

170
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,655
It better not be SpongeBob.

171
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:55,077
So... who's responsible
for all the sound?

172
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,274
You're not our usual Rent-a-Cop.

173
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,510
Chuck had a breakdown.
Chuck was weak.

174
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,212
This whole...

175
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:08,387
This whole ZIP code is now my domain,
and I am hip to you, little missy.

176
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,658
Got a call about excessive noise.

177
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,958
Keep it down.

178
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,732
Hello. May I?

179
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,341
It's a Coke.

180
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,080
It's a Coke.

181
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,591
But you can't be too sure, 'cause
you kids are very crafty these days.

182
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,183
Yeah, yuck. I'm gonna be
watching you, little yuck.

183
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,266
- What's with this guy?
- Let me get it this time.

184
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,536
What are you doing here?

185
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,938
Todd and I hooked up.
So we decided to skip the dance.

186
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,499
Okay, you guys
have done the makeovers,

187
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,308
the website vandalism,
and the frozen bra, right?

188
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,575
Um... yeah.

189
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,810
So, let's get this gala started.

190
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,353
Yeah. Send it.

191
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,686
Question. What's going on?

192
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,726
That was Liz.
She's having a party, too.

193
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,783
We heard.

194
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,625
So we decided to
put together a little hunt.

195
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,289
Who are you?

196
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,731
Yancy.

197
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,328
I'm Yancy. We had
P.E. Together all year.

198
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,395
You're orange.

199
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,135
Oh, my God, Yancy,
you are orange.

200
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,439
You used too much Presto Tan.

201
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,511
Steve Phillips? Dream on.

202
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,980
Turn on your web cam.

203
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,748
We just gave each other
thongs with our names on them.

204
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,882
Wicked. One for me?

205
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,518
But of course.

206
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,363
- Hey, Julie, did Mom leave?
- Get out!

207
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,559
- I only found Dad.
- Go!

208
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,068
My kingdom for a lock!

209
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,939
Did you get the hunt list?

210
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,031
Opening now.

211
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,372
Hunt? Hunting what?

212
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,209
Scavenger hunting.

213
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,113
Oh, see, we're not allowed
to leave the hou...

214
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,584
You have one of those
Polaroid sticker cameras, right?

215
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,052
But of course.

216
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,612
Use it to document the tasks.

217
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,215
Here's the list.

218
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,816
We start at 8:00, sharp as nails.

219
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,352
We sketched in something
extra special for Jules.

220
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,831
Special? What special?

221
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,097
"Dress a window mannequin
at Old Navy in your own clothes.

222
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,129
"Have a guy from datesafe. Com
buy you a drink at the Cosmo Club.

223
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,971
"Get a security decal
off a PatrolTec car,

224
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,908
and..."

225
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,176
"Borrow a pair
of Steve Phillips' boxer shorts"?

226
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,149
- No, no, no, no.
- What's in it for us?

227
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,707
Thongs.

228
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,185
- Pass.
- Double pass.

229
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,916
- Unless...
- Hannah.

230
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,924
...we make it interesting.

231
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,289
Speak it.

232
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,622
Lunch spot.

233
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,595
Winning group
eats at the fountain next year,

234
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,428
and losers eat at the Dumpsters.

235
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,491
No prob.

236
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,560
Hannah, can I
talk to you for a second?

237
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,302
I cannot do the things on that list.

238
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,870
I'll just eat Wonder Bread
by the Dumpsters

239
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,245
with the rest of the frumps.

240
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,806
Julie, focus.

241
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,648
What do you want
more than anything in this world?

242
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,450
Anything anything?

243
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,185
Ultimate anything.

244
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,592
- Steve.
- Exactly.

245
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,688
Do you think
he eats by the Dumpsters?

246
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,791
You could be sitting
right next to him at the fountain.

247
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,429
And plus, if you don't do this,
everyone's gonna hear about it.

248
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,336
We live in a suck universe

249
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,103
where wearing the wrong sneakers
can make us life outcasts.

250
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,370
I know, but...

251
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,436
You and I both know that we're
not just talking about a lunch spot.

252
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,677
We're talking about
who you're going to be in high school.

253
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,342
You have to do this.

254
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,578
I hate it when you sound right.

255
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,558
Only, we can't leave the house.
My mom will cancel Hawaii, and...

256
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,690
Follow.

257
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,166
What happened to your room?

258
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,865
Oh, is it different?
I hadn't noticed.

259
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,430
Mom redid it.

260
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,840
They weren't expecting him back so soon.

261
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:20,901
What's that?

262
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,504
Oh, that?

263
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:27,314
That is where my Miss Hawaiian Tropic
standee once stood.

264
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,980
Now... a yoga zone.

265
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:34,048
And have you seen
the new craft corner?

266
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,252
I had a dream about these.

267
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,093
They were trying to kill me.

268
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,897
My glory days have been erased.

269
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:47,098
My beer cap collection,
my cheerleader hate mail...

270
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,610
I think I have a fever.

271
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,169
Getting back to the real world...

272
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,010
...we have a proposition.

273
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,017
It involves money.

274
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,109
My money.

275
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,418
"Your money" is my favorite word.

276
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,362
I had to promise Ren fifty
of my Hot Dog on a Stick dollars

277
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,624
to cover for us.

278
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,859
She's getting us
a neato date for tonight.

279
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,161
"Neato"?

280
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,135
Pull yourself into the century.

281
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,636
Is this a good idea?

282
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,138
This site is totally safe.

283
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,268
Okay, what should our name be?

284
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,237
June.

285
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,609
Occupation?

286
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,669
Tree surgeon.

287
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,638
What?

288
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,582
Swimsuit model.

289
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,553
Okay, we're brunette, 5' 7".

290
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,647
- Hobbies?
- Dancing.

291
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,952
Sewing.

292
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,583
Eating cheese.

293
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,959
Kidding.

294
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,656
Sitting...

295
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,221
on the beach.

296
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,563
"I'm looking for someone
way gorgeous

297
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,660
to buy me a drink tonight
at the Cosmo Club."

298
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,570
Wait. We have to get
into the Cosmo Club?

299
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,235
And I'll be wearing
a paisley scarf.

300
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,178
How exactly are you going to be
a tall, brunette swimsuit model?

301
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,181
I'm not. You are.

302
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,409
Me?

303
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,849
Yes, you.

304
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,444
- Me?
- Is she broken?

305
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,216
She's fine.

306
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,656
The 'net rocks.
We have a winner.

307
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,851
Already?

308
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,417
"Dave. Handsome. Ooh.

309
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:20,659
Hobbies: Reading,
hiking, sunsets, and cliff diving."

310
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,290
He's perfect.

311
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,597
Perfect? How is he perfect?

312
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,763
He'll be wearing a brown jacket
with a red tie.

313
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,103
What does the blue ribbon mean?

314
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,698
It means he's been
verified by the site.

315
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,765
He's okay.

316
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,312
And plus we'll all be
sticking together, right?

317
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,607
Of course.

318
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,046
Done.

319
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,640
Hork- hork. Outside.

320
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,877
Got the Beemer.

321
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,442
Let's get outta here.

322
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,544
Coming.

323
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,386
See ya.

324
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,459
Wait, where are you going?

325
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,861
You didn't for serious think I was
going to be on your team, did you?

326
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,899
First team to complete all the tasks

327
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,832
and show up
at the high school parking lot

328
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,369
wins the spot.

329
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,530
But... we don't have a car.

330
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,137
Ther you lose.

331
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,542
We'll get a car,
and we'll get the fountain spot.

332
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,046
Pleathers.

333
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,877
Posers.

334
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,098
Hey, how come Liz can drive?

335
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,759
She already has her learner's permit.

336
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,826
She was held back a year.

337
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,395
She is so lucky.

338
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,401
I blame you.

339
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,444
That was excruciating.

340
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,583
Let's dominate.

341
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,598
I look like my mother.

342
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,936
Hold on.

343
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,451
Now... you look like
your mother 20 years ago,

344
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,388
with fashion sense.

345
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,289
I think I can get us a car.

346
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,253
Speak.

347
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,570
Papa Bear is still under the sink.

348
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,506
Repeat, Papa Bear
is still under the sink.

349
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,667
Over.

350
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,008
Ren, we are still inside the house.

351
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,947
Do not call unless it's an emergency.

352
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,109
10-4. Over and out.

353
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,257
Do you guys think
we should be doing this?

354
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,583
Let's go.

355
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,131
I'm pretty stuck.

356
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,233
Pull.

357
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,253
Look at my dad.

358
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,724
He is so oblivious.

359
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,494
Help.

360
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,461
- Great rescue, guys.
- Sorry.

361
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,904
Come on.

362
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,783
Destination Hottie House in sight.

363
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,780
I'm okay.

364
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:51,367
Officially, the smallest car
I've ever seen.

365
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,238
It looks like a clown car.

366
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,798
It's an electric car.

367
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,970
It's made out of this really hard
recycled stuff.

368
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,038
My dad taught me how to drive it
in the mall parking lot,

369
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,141
said I could use it for an emergency,

370
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,086
which it kinda seems like this is.

371
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,059
That's my hand!

372
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,260
No, sadly, that's my hand.

373
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,814
Fake food's come a long way
in the last ten years.

374
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,662
Wrong room.

375
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,433
All I can find are these scrunchies.

376
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,137
Yeah, and socks.

377
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,340
Cha-ching! I found bras!

378
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,208
Yeah!

379
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,948
Dude, clue. Don't you think
there's something missing?

380
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,949
What?

381
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,187
The girls!

382
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:27,197
Right, right.
Where are the babes?

383
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,459
Gone.

384
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,057
Gone?

385
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,932
This diary raid skeaves!

386
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,502
Girls! Everything all right up there?

387
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,374
If you tell anyone about this...

388
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,180
I will so injure you.

389
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,222
Looks like we're going
on a scavenger hunt, men.

390
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,570
That guy just waved at me.

391
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,348
I am so smushed, I can't even
return a wave at a cute guy.

392
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,146
Cute guys never wave at me.

393
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,416
Oh, what am I saying?
No guys ever wave at me.

394
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,717
I'm fat.

395
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,725
You are not fat. Who told you
that you were fat?

396
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,852
Uh... Staci and Liz.

397
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,023
I heard they have scales
in their gym lockers.

398
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,931
They do. They made me
stand on it in front of everyone.

399
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,094
It was the worst moment of my life.

400
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,330
That's hideous.

401
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,570
Yancy, would you rather eat
celery or a brownie?

402
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,576
What is that, a trick question?

403
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,633
Exactly.

404
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,806
So you'll just date guys
who like brownies.

405
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,944
Okay. First on the list,
mannequins.

406
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,790
They look so cute in your clothes.

407
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,849
Smile!

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,330
Good luck.

409
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,097
Keep it.

410
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,202
<i>Attertior. shoppers. Old Navy</i>
<i>will be closing ir five minutes.</i>

411
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,676
They locked it.

412
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,973
Of course they did.

413
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,207
There's another
display window over there.

414
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,271
Let's go.

415
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,047
They're guys.

416
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,057
I don't think they're gonna fit
into our miniskirts.

417
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,888
We have to try.

418
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,949
Let's go.

419
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,967
Freeze!

420
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,895
Who would design this guy?
He's got thunder thighs.

421
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,083
Okay, we got it. Ready?

422
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,213
Smile!

423
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,416
Hey!

424
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,356
I see you!

425
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,757
And I got ya!

426
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,465
Okay, come back in here!

427
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,600
Open up this door!

428
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,807
Bye!

429
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,976
Oh, that is so not cool!

430
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,464
All right, I'm coming.

431
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,264
Okay, here you go.
Thanks, man.

432
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,703
You girls better eat
all this pizza.

433
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,709
I'll deliver those pies to 'em.

434
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,644
You're gonna take the pizzas
up to your sister?

435
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,376
Dad, you have
Aquapure momentum.

436
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,281
Don't stop now.

437
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,617
I do. Yeah. All right.

438
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,849
As a matter of fact, you're gonna be
the first one to taste the new water.

439
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:53,948
Let's go. Come on.

440
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,223
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

441
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,286
The pizzas!

442
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,367
So you're done?

443
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,163
One more adjustment and I will be.

444
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,225
All right.

445
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,670
Yeah?

446
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,175
Did the pizzas come?

447
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,675
M y so ocos say yos

448
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,579
You have to make them
all disappear.

449
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,208
What's the offer?

450
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,048
- Laundry.
- Keep talking.

451
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,246
<i>Your laurdry.</i>

452
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,516
I will do your laundry for a month.

453
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,319
Done.

454
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,519
Business deal?

455
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,324
Exactly.

456
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,386
Good for you.

457
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,334
All right, this is gonna change
the way you look at water.

458
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,899
You first.

459
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,779
I gotta just check the line.

460
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,008
Good thought.

461
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,610
There's no place to park.

462
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,953
Check it...
he's letting in the pleathers.

463
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,016
You guys, we're never
gonna beat them.

464
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,756
Okay, try parking around the corner.
We'll be quick.

465
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,036
We're throwing 'em out.

466
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,303
We're not gonna eat all these...

467
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,366
till we're sick...

468
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,879
writhing on the floor in pain.

469
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,647
Go.

470
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,652
This is so good.
I'm gonna kill you.

471
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,334
We're with them,
the girls you just let in.

472
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,597
Yeah, the other girls.

473
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,400
What are you doing here?

474
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,838
Scavenger hunting.

475
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,102
Okay, no.

476
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,769
All right, get gone, all of you.

477
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,006
- Hey.
- This is so not fair.

478
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,447
I don't have to be fair.
I have the pretty rope.

479
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,007
Now scram!

480
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:27,137
I'll bet your date's inside right now
buying Staci a drink.

481
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,975
Date? You have a date?

482
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,741
Oh, this rocks!

483
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,575
Look!

484
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,410
They're about to get their picture!

485
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,375
We have to find Dave.

486
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,183
Hey, is that...

487
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,722
Mr. Corrado?!

488
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,089
Now there are no surprises
left in this world.

489
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,991
Corrado goes clubbing?

490
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,489
Okay, focus on finding Dave.

491
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,034
Now, what exactly is he
supposed to be wearing?

492
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,002
A brown jacket

493
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,504
with a red tie.

494
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,562
Oh, my gosh!

495
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,905
You're wrong. There is
one surprise left in this world.

496
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,207
- Mr. Corrado's my date!
- What?!

497
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,769
He'll report us for sure.

498
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,440
Let's go.

499
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,746
Excuse us, excuse us!

500
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,350
June! June!

501
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:49,052
- He's seen me!
- Your scarf... get rid of it!

502
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,390
You dropped this.

503
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,451
No, I didn't.

504
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,895
- Yes.
- No.

505
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,899
- Keep it.
- No!

506
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,457
Uh... June.

507
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,659
No, sorry.

508
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:04,868
Well, you're the only one here
with a paisley scarf, so...

509
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,910
No, I'm sorry.
That's not me.

510
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,778
Okay, I know I might be
a disappointment physically,

511
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,043
but I have great wit.

512
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,790
Hi.

513
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,985
Would you like a drink?

514
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,051
Sure.

515
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:28,995
What would you like?

516
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,557
A Chunky Monkey.

517
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,570
Isn't that a milkshake?

518
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,969
Oh, um...

519
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,342
What?! Are you crazy?

520
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,471
Excuse me?

521
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,851
A sex on the beach. My fave.

522
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,358
Oh. Two.

523
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:01,323
So, what's it like
being a swimsuit model?

524
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,492
Um... cold.

525
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,594
Well, yeah.

526
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,867
Have we met before?
Your laugh is so familiar.

527
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,933
My laugh?

528
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,172
Actually, it's not my laugh.

529
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,774
You see, I'm trying out different laughs
until I find the right one.

530
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,182
What do you think of this one?

531
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:27,953
Here's your drinks.

532
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,492
Can I see some I.D.?

533
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,891
My I.D.?

534
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,864
Oh, um, I left it in my limo.

535
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,495
Sorry.

536
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,365
Julie.

537
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,636
Hi, Mr. Corrado.

538
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,875
A swimsuit model?

539
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:59,746
This is so typical. I either
get stood up or worse... and this is worse!

540
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,382
How did you ever get in here?

541
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,189
It's a long story,
but the cheat-sheet version is,

542
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,730
I'm on a scavenger hunt
for a lunch spot.

543
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,735
The fountain.

544
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,101
How do you know about the fountain?

545
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,164
I'm not that old.

546
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,072
I went to Abbott High School, too.

547
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,572
Never did get to
sit at the fountain, though.

548
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,716
Okay, get going.

549
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,876
Actually, could you buy me a drink?

550
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,113
A soda would fulfill the hunt list.

551
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,088
But I have to get a picture of it.

552
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,215
I should have known that
you would be nearby.

553
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,784
Two ginger ales for these two.

554
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,295
With olives.

555
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,523
It's very cosmopolitan.

556
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,467
Hey, sweet thing.
Wanna dance?

557
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,669
When hell freezes over... twice.

558
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,969
She likes me.

559
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,835
Hey... do you want to sneak in?

560
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,568
No, thanks.
I'm waiting for someone.

561
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,109
Your boyfriend.

562
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,542
My boyfriend?

563
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,807
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

564
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,007
Playing hard to get?

565
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,883
I'm just sitting here.
I'm not playing anything.

566
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:39,013
Well, I gotta go to another gig.
Their speaker blew.

567
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,615
That's what I do during the summer,
I move speakers.

568
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:47,653
It's not, like, my life goal or anything,
but, you know, it's money.

569
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,825
That's nice.

570
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,096
Why are you talking to me?

571
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,194
What do you mean?

572
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,137
Well, guys never talk to me.

573
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:00,803
I mean, sometimes they ask me to hold
the door for them, but that's about it.

574
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,607
What's your name?

575
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,511
- Yancy.
- Peter.

576
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,483
And I would never ask you
to hold a door.

577
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,459
What's with you?
Your face is all glad-Iooking.

578
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,023
A guy...
a really cute guy...

579
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:29,300
and he talked to me like a guy
talks to a girl that he maybe might like.

580
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,567
Where'd he go?

581
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,370
He left.

582
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,537
And I'll probably never,
ever see him again.

583
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,808
This is the worst night of my life.

584
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,307
Your girls are drinking
with Mr. Corrado.

585
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,580
- Total grode.
- Pathetic.

586
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,686
Okay.

587
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,728
You have to leave.
You girls shouldn't be here.

588
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,822
Mr. Corrado, some female-type advice...

589
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,026
Should I be afraid?

590
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,035
Loosen your tie.

591
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,306
Come here.

592
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,352
Looks good.

593
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,186
Who would have guessed?

594
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,748
Hi.

595
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,190
Do you want to dance?

596
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,458
Yeah. Sure.

597
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,670
We still have a chance
at winning. Let's go.

598
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,647
I think I just had a stroke.

599
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,156
- What?
- Up there on that platform.

600
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,955
- Is that...?
- My mother!

601
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:02,157
What is she doing?
This is like Moms Gore Wild.

602
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,169
She can't... wiggle... like that.
She's a mother.

603
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,728
She uses Saran Wrap.
She makes mac and cheese.

604
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,774
She drives a Volvo.

605
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,509
Yeah, older babeage,
shaking her boo-tay.

606
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,608
Do you think my dad
knows about this?

607
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,744
Oh, this is horrible!
I mean, my mom's a...

608
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,848
Who is she?

609
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,426
Whoever she is,
she's headed this way. Let's go.

610
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,659
Come on.

611
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,723
Was I?

612
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,360
Yeah, you were just shaking!

613
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,426
Yes.

614
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,773
What is that?

615
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,469
I think it's my scarf.

616
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,978
Yeah, but you weren't wearing a scarf.

617
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,536
I know.

618
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,784
Gabby!
Gabby, who did you see?

619
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,387
I'm not sure.

620
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,365
Oh, shoot. No reception.

621
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,764
I have to make a call.

622
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,565
I'm beyond dead.
She's calling Dad.

623
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,800
Ren will cover.

624
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,604
She's gonna want to
talk to me.

625
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:24,137
Hello! Is anyone else concerned
that we're sitting in trash?

626
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,681
Yeah, so, anyway...
oh, my God, did I tell you?

627
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,885
I have to get home before...

628
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,622
This cannot happen.

629
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:44,063
Really okay.

630
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,433
Where to next?

631
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,792
All right, so I'll see you later,
hopefully. All right. Bye.

632
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,574
Okay, so I'll see you
in a few minutes?

633
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,407
All right. Okay, bye-bye.

634
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,606
Oh, wait. No way. Really?

635
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,918
Who was that?

636
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,783
Oh, come on.
Come on, come on.

637
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:25,894
Twinkie, yeah.

638
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:43,375
Hello?

639
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,115
<i>Hi. Sweetheart.</i>

640
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,316
Are the girls there?

641
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,188
They're here, of course!

642
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,453
Have you seen them?

643
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,516
Yeah.

644
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:15,607
SpongeBob.

645
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,717
Where else would they be?

646
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,580
Yeah.

647
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,992
Oh, it's all coming together.

648
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,893
Where would they be?

649
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,989
They're great.

650
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,866
Hey, hey, hey! Turn it off!

651
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,371
Look, l...

652
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,001
No, no, no! Turn it off!
No, turn it off!

653
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,066
I didn't do it!

654
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,134
Off!

655
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,543
Thank you!

656
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,082
Honey, it sounds like
we're being attacked.

657
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,244
What? Attacked? Oh, no.

658
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:55,349
No! The next- door neighbor, the hose
was going all over into our yard.

659
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,690
Just bring the phone
up to Julie's room.

660
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,260
Julie...

661
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,802
your mom's on the phone.

662
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:11,930
Jules?

663
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,803
Yeah, Dad?

664
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,711
Your mom's on the phone.

665
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,553
Hello?

666
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,715
Hi. Is everything okay?

667
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,622
Yeah, Mom, everything's fine.

668
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,160
So what are you girls up to?

669
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,217
Stuff.

670
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,285
<i>What stuff?</i>

671
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,921
Just stuff, okay?

672
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,625
Julie, need I remind you...?

673
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,828
<i>Mom. H krow all your rules...
no moving. No smiling</i>.

674
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,892
No breathing.

675
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,235
<i>Honey. Those rules</i>
<i>are for your own good.</i>

676
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,605
You girls should be getting
to bed now, anyway.

677
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,975
Bed? It's barely 9:30.
How old do you think we are?

678
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,035
Honey, why is it...?

679
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,945
<i>Why don't you just freeze me
<i>ir a time capsule?</i>

680
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,676
That way I stay little forever.

681
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,515
Okay, I'm going now.
Behave. Goodbye.

682
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,520
That was way too close.

683
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,693
I'm freaking exhausted.

684
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,137
I need to go back to college
and get some rest.

685
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,337
I don't know how to say this,
but thanks.

686
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:22,242
And can you cover for us
for just a little longer?

687
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,538
Go be a teenager.

688
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,440
It ends too soon.

689
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,354
And it gets replaced
by ribbons and lampshades.

690
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,633
Steve's house.

691
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,227
Uh-oh.

692
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,501
Define "uh-oh."

693
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,634
I think the car needs charging.

694
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,043
What? We ran out of juice
in front of Steve's house?

695
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,083
It has a quick charge function.
I just need a plug.

696
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,311
A plug?

697
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:03,785
Calm yourself.

698
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:07,221
We'll take care of the car,
you just go get his boxers.

699
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,816
Wait... why do I have to
boost his boxers?

700
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:14,489
Are you kidding? The only reason this
is even on the list is because of you.

701
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,999
She's right.
This one's all you.

702
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,835
Do you think he's in there?

703
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,667
It's almost ten.
He might be at the dance by now.

704
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,832
Or he might be inside getting ready.

705
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,002
I mean, no one great
shows up before ten.

706
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,477
Thanks for that.

707
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,258
I can't do this.
Let's go home. We lose.

708
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,055
You are Julie...

709
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,391
great knees, powerful brain.

710
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,294
You can do this.

711
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,925
"Great knees"?
"Powerful brain"?

712
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,299
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

713
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,065
What do you care anyway?

714
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,935
You're moving.

715
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,066
That's why I care.

716
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,407
Julie, I know you can do this.

717
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,695
Ugh! Serious ugh!

718
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,589
Got 'em!

719
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,796
Here she comes!

720
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,671
She did it.

721
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,145
She actually went inside.

722
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,809
This is gonna be
worth the price of admission.

723
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,409
PatrolTec Security, please.

724
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:49,357
Hello, I'd like to report
a suspicious person at 947 Oak Lane.

725
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,620
Thank you.

726
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:51,683
Done.

727
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,045
You think that's the girl?

728
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,607
Hard to tell. It was dark.

729
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,932
A plug! I found a plug!

730
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,219
Of course.

731
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,552
You know, I think this is the girl,

732
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,716
and I recognize her from somewhere.

733
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,522
I think I knew her
in my grade school or something.

734
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:03,588
So?

735
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,760
She grew up nice.

736
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,532
Drama club, basketball,
debate team.

737
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:13,235
Hobbies... hot dogs,
skateboarding, and napping.

738
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,505
Steve, what are you doing?

739
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,241
There's, like, a gym full of girls
waiting for you.

740
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:23,476
Basketball, boarding, and dogs.

741
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,413
Hey, hurry up!
Dance ends at midnight!

742
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,164
Okay, we can almost reach.

743
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,998
Come on.

744
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,504
Okay, stop!

745
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:17,833
Stop pushing!

746
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,500
We're not pushing anymore!

747
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,183
Oh, no!

748
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,219
What the heck was that?

749
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,364
Okay, here we go.

750
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,495
Oh, flashlight!

751
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,062
Gonna leave a mark.
There we go.

752
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:58,337
Look, someone smacked
into the PatrolTec guy!

753
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,145
- Sweet!
- I know.

754
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,413
Securing the perimeter.

755
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,118
There's the suspect.
Hey, you!

756
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,557
PatrolTec Security!

757
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,356
All right, I've spotted you!

758
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,796
Security officer on the premises!
Right here!

759
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,959
And we win.

760
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,467
We always win.

761
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,299
Is there no one to challenge us?

762
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:22,838
Let's scoot over to the dance.

763
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,737
What's the point?

764
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,072
It's obvious they're not even
going to finish.

765
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,408
Let's just go get juicers.

766
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:34,007
Is there a reason you don't want to
go to the dance... like a Todd reason?

767
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,382
No. There's no Todd reason.

768
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,886
Then what's your affliction?

769
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,388
I'm sure one of my sister's friends
can get us in.

770
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,118
Let's just go.

771
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,760
I got a suspicious person call
at this address,

772
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,857
and you look suspicious to me.

773
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,563
Hey... haven't I seen you before?

774
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,503
I don't think so.

775
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,507
What's your name?

776
00:52:58,575 --> 00:52:59,906
Julie.

777
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:04,345
And why are you damp, Julie?

778
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:07,110
I was surprised by some sprinklers.

779
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:17,289
- What have we here?
- I can explain.

780
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,521
I doubt it. Follow me.

781
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,892
Hey, where's the tiny green car?

782
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:23,955
What?

783
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,763
The tiny car that hit me?

784
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,236
Not even a dent.

785
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,973
Told you this thing was tough.

786
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,538
Hello! How are we
gonna salvage Julie?

787
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,982
Did you guys already panty-raid
skater-boy Steve?

788
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,250
Yeah, but Julie got nabbed
by Joe PatrolTec.

789
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,485
She needs a hero.

790
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,998
Your telephone number, please.

791
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:03,928
Hey!

792
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:07,637
No heels on the hardwood floor, okay?

793
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:20,352
I don't know what girls
are always whining about.

794
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,084
Heels aren't so bad.

795
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,318
I'll get it!

796
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,428
Yes, good evening.

797
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,992
This is Officer Shiner
from PatrolTec Security.

798
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,264
Is this Mr. Corky?

799
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,209
Uh-huh. Well, I'm standing here
with your daughter Julie.

800
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,335
That's right.

801
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,840
All right.

802
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,007
Your father
wants to talk to you.

803
00:54:58,662 --> 00:54:59,993
Dad?

804
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,896
Fifty monthly for six months.

805
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,298
Um, what was that, Dad?

806
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:09,429
You have no idea how close Dad
just came to answering this phone.

807
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,134
I had to hurt myself,

808
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,073
and I'm wearing red pumps.

809
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,578
Fifty monthly for six months.

810
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,307
No.

811
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,008
No?

812
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,313
No. Three.

813
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,250
You're negotiating row?

814
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,585
That's right. I'll be home soon.

815
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,716
That is...

816
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,196
She renegotiated and hung up.

817
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,860
She's way more impressive
than I thought.

818
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:42,738
Don't move.

819
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:46,708
I know I've got a field
interrogation card in here somewhere.

820
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,266
Julie, get in!

821
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,176
Hey! Tiny green car!

822
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,842
- What are you doing?
- Winning!

823
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,252
That's my official decal!

824
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,952
We've got everything!
Let's get to the high school!

825
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,028
That is it. Come on.

826
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,897
What is the problem? Come on.

827
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:24,042
Why do people
even have children? Why?

828
00:56:29,049 --> 00:56:31,984
Whoa! You are my hero!

829
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:33,542
I'll write songs about you.

830
00:56:35,588 --> 00:56:36,577
Look!

831
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:39,950
They stopped for juicers?

832
00:56:40,026 --> 00:56:41,721
- They're still in the game?
- Let's go!

833
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:52,369
Come on! Go faster!

834
00:57:04,918 --> 00:57:05,907
Tie!

835
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:08,419
Calm your jets.
Let's compare goods first.

836
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:16,556
So, all things being equal,
tiebreaker.

837
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:19,564
What? No, we share the spot.

838
00:57:19,632 --> 00:57:22,066
Share? With you?
Don't think so.

839
00:57:22,135 --> 00:57:23,932
Tiebreaker, winner take all.

840
00:57:24,003 --> 00:57:25,334
You're on.

841
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:29,171
First one to get the king
or queen's crown at the dance, wins.

842
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:30,334
What?

843
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,878
Staci, isn't that Todd's car?

844
00:57:32,946 --> 00:57:34,709
That is his car.

845
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:40,151
I thought you guys decided
you were skipping the dance, Staci.

846
00:57:47,393 --> 00:57:49,884
Are we really going into the dance?

847
00:57:50,964 --> 00:57:52,864
You bet we are. Follow.

848
00:58:13,987 --> 00:58:15,852
Tickets, please.

849
00:58:15,922 --> 00:58:18,857
Hold on. Where's your ticket?

850
00:58:18,925 --> 00:58:20,790
Oh, I...

851
00:58:23,029 --> 00:58:24,223
...don't have one.

852
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:27,528
Sorry. No ticket, no dance.

853
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:32,036
I know who you are.

854
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,803
You do?

855
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:40,209
You're out here collecting tickets
instead of being inside at the dance.

856
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,613
You spend your weekends
doing extra-credit algebra,

857
00:58:43,683 --> 00:58:47,016
you play way too much
Monopoly with your parents,

858
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:51,079
and you've never eaten
anywhere near the fountain.

859
00:58:51,157 --> 00:58:56,561
And in four years, I will be you
unless I get into that dance.

860
00:59:04,404 --> 00:59:05,769
You go.

861
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:08,898
Get in there.
Do it for all those who never could.

862
00:59:08,975 --> 00:59:12,035
- Did we win?
- Almost. We still have to get the crown.

863
00:59:13,947 --> 00:59:16,006
Get... crown.

864
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:19,441
What crown?

865
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:37,560
So this is it...
a high school dance.

866
00:59:37,637 --> 00:59:40,470
They don't even let us
wear shoes at our dances.

867
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,440
And they serve warm Kool-Aid.

868
00:59:42,508 --> 00:59:45,068
I wonder if Steve's here.

869
00:59:48,047 --> 00:59:51,380
Hey, spazmonkey, stand still.

870
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:53,043
Let's scope.

871
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,317
Where is Todd?
Do you see him?

872
00:59:59,392 --> 01:00:02,259
Not yet. Remain calm
until the evidence is in.

873
01:00:08,501 --> 01:00:11,061
Are you gonna ask someone to dance?
Come on, ask someone to dance.

874
01:00:11,137 --> 01:00:13,230
No, man, just leave me alone.

875
01:00:13,306 --> 01:00:14,796
Dude.

876
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:17,836
You guys remember a girl
named Julie Corky?

877
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,902
Wasn't she on our grade school bus?

878
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,540
Yes. I knew that was her.

879
01:00:24,584 --> 01:00:26,677
Gregg and I saw her
boarding tonight in a red dress.

880
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:29,085
She looked sweet.

881
01:00:29,155 --> 01:00:30,247
Nice one.

882
01:00:30,323 --> 01:00:32,587
Hi. Hey.

883
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:35,890
Hi. Do you...

884
01:00:36,963 --> 01:00:39,488
...know if your friend wants to dance?

885
01:00:41,067 --> 01:00:42,557
I don't know. Ask him.

886
01:00:42,635 --> 01:00:44,535
Could you ask him for me?

887
01:00:47,674 --> 01:00:52,407
Dude, that girl,
my dream girl, dance with her.

888
01:00:56,349 --> 01:00:57,338
Sure.

889
01:01:08,428 --> 01:01:10,419
Maybe they just met.

890
01:01:11,397 --> 01:01:13,661
Yeah. Maybe.

891
01:01:13,733 --> 01:01:15,564
Almost time for
the big dance contest,

892
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:17,762
and remember, anything goes,

893
01:01:17,837 --> 01:01:20,431
so just pretend
that Mrs. Withers and I aren't here.

894
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:23,909
Badness. Look over there!

895
01:01:26,279 --> 01:01:27,268
Come on!

896
01:01:40,026 --> 01:01:42,221
Guess you changed your mind
about the dance.

897
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:43,353
Staci.

898
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:48,557
Who the hell are you?

899
01:01:48,634 --> 01:01:50,727
- I'm his girlfriend.
- Oh, really?

900
01:01:50,803 --> 01:01:54,330
Because I'm his girlfriend.
Have been for six months.

901
01:01:57,944 --> 01:02:00,378
Catfight! Meow!

902
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:19,529
Stay away from my footballer.

903
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:20,964
You can have him!

904
01:02:23,302 --> 01:02:25,293
Hey, where you going?

905
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:27,635
Get real. She's not worth it.

906
01:02:27,707 --> 01:02:29,197
Are you kidding?

907
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:32,608
Staci? Staci's a prime goddess.

908
01:02:32,678 --> 01:02:35,875
If I had a girl like Staci,
I would worship her.

909
01:02:35,948 --> 01:02:38,508
She hooked up with you,
and now you dump her?

910
01:02:38,584 --> 01:02:40,711
What a typical quarterback move.

911
01:02:40,787 --> 01:02:45,554
Princess doesn't hook up.
Never has, never will.

912
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:49,024
I...

913
01:02:49,095 --> 01:02:51,791
Looks like someone
isn't so different from us after all.

914
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,061
All right, everybody grab a partner.

915
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:57,000
The mojo dance contest
is about to begin.

916
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:59,867
Come on, Todd. Let's go
command the dance contest.

917
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:04,774
Too bad. So sad.

918
01:03:04,844 --> 01:03:07,210
Guess you don't have
anyone to enter with.

919
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,838
Yes I do.

920
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,406
You've got to be kidding.

921
01:03:11,484 --> 01:03:14,453
Staci, did the fall
give you brain damage?

922
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,978
Bite me! I can dance!

923
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:24,222
What do you say, girlfriends?

924
01:03:24,297 --> 01:03:25,992
But we don't have
anyone to dance with.

925
01:03:26,065 --> 01:03:28,295
Who else do we need?
Let's go!

926
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:33,958
Freshman year, we have arrived!

927
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:41,572
What is it?

928
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:43,302
Some sort of list.

929
01:04:43,376 --> 01:04:45,571
"PatrolTec decal.

930
01:04:45,645 --> 01:04:47,078
"This one's for Julie...

931
01:04:47,146 --> 01:04:49,637
Get Steve Phillips' boxer shorts."

932
01:04:49,715 --> 01:04:52,183
That's where my boxers went!

933
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:53,741
"Get crown."

934
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:56,686
Dude, look,
it's the girl in the red dress!

935
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,300
There's clearly
one shining couple here tonight,

936
01:05:50,376 --> 01:05:53,345
and here they are, the winners
of the mojo dance contest!

937
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:56,574
Whatever.

938
01:05:56,649 --> 01:05:58,879
Well, you aren't a very good dancer.

939
01:05:58,951 --> 01:05:59,940
What?

940
01:06:09,695 --> 01:06:10,684
Thanks.

941
01:06:12,698 --> 01:06:16,065
Hey, you want to see
a picture of me in a coma?

942
01:06:17,303 --> 01:06:19,100
Okay.

943
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:20,604
Really?

944
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:27,405
Sweet.

945
01:06:29,982 --> 01:06:34,385
You know, this doesn't mean that we're,
like, boyfriend and girlfriend or anything.

946
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:36,717
Oh, I know,
but now I've got this picture,

947
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:40,748
and this picture is way better
than my coma picture.

948
01:06:40,826 --> 01:06:44,887
Dude, you are an insta-legend.

949
01:06:45,898 --> 01:06:47,627
Could we have our picture
taken with you?

950
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:51,058
Be cool, guys.

951
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:58,572
This is the sweetest slumber party ever.

952
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:00,874
Yeah. Aren't you glad
Staci couldn't come?

953
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:01,935
What? Why?

954
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:05,074
Because Julie's mom only let her
invite three girls.

955
01:07:07,086 --> 01:07:08,986
I...

956
01:07:09,055 --> 01:07:11,080
was the replacement?

957
01:07:11,157 --> 01:07:14,024
I mean... no.

958
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:16,323
I was the replacement.

959
01:07:18,264 --> 01:07:19,595
What did you say to her?

960
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:23,101
- I didn't mean to. It just...
- What?

961
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:27,367
I told her that she
replaced Staci at the party.

962
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,805
Oh, no.

963
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:30,501
I'm sorry.

964
01:07:30,576 --> 01:07:33,136
Let's go find her. Come on.

965
01:07:35,448 --> 01:07:37,177
Before Mr. Chilton announces
the king and queen,

966
01:07:37,249 --> 01:07:39,183
we have a special dedication,

967
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:40,912
to Yancy

968
01:07:40,986 --> 01:07:42,886
from the speaker-moving guy.

969
01:08:11,117 --> 01:08:12,812
What are you doing here?

970
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:14,512
I told you I had another gig.

971
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:16,020
I saw you dancing out there.

972
01:08:16,088 --> 01:08:18,886
I thought you might want to
try with a partner.

973
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:20,447
Yes.

974
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:31,027
Someone for everyone...

975
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,003
except me.

976
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:38,500
On the bright yet dim side,
we could still win the scavenger hunt.

977
01:08:38,577 --> 01:08:39,566
True.

978
01:08:39,645 --> 01:08:41,670
Where do you think
they keep those crowns?

979
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:44,306
Come on.

980
01:08:45,384 --> 01:08:47,852
- Do you like brownies?
- Are you kidding?

981
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,753
Brownies are
a very important food group.

982
01:08:55,294 --> 01:08:56,659
The crowns aren't here.

983
01:08:56,729 --> 01:08:58,526
So you haven't won.

984
01:08:58,597 --> 01:08:59,586
Yet.

985
01:08:59,665 --> 01:09:03,157
We're not giving the fountain spot
to you Dumpster frumpsters.

986
01:09:03,235 --> 01:09:05,328
Talk, talk, talk, and no action.

987
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:11,101
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

988
01:09:11,177 --> 01:09:13,645
You've been voting all week
for king and queen.

989
01:09:14,647 --> 01:09:17,946
Jennifer Allen and Steve Phillips.

990
01:09:19,018 --> 01:09:20,110
He won?

991
01:09:20,186 --> 01:09:21,881
Steve won!

992
01:09:24,523 --> 01:09:27,356
Jennifer's a bud of mine,
a former cheer squad leader.

993
01:09:27,426 --> 01:09:28,916
She'll give me the crown for sure.

994
01:09:33,532 --> 01:09:35,090
Choose your partners, guys.

995
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:36,862
This song's reserved for you.

996
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:50,373
Julie? Julie Corky?

997
01:09:55,754 --> 01:09:57,619
He just said your name!

998
01:09:58,691 --> 01:09:59,953
That was real?

999
01:10:00,025 --> 01:10:01,253
Yes!

1000
01:10:13,072 --> 01:10:14,562
Wanna dance?

1001
01:10:29,488 --> 01:10:32,321
I didn't even know you knew who I was.

1002
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:44,964
You win.

1003
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:49,703
- Julie got the crown!
- We win!

1004
01:10:49,775 --> 01:10:51,675
We win the scavenger hunt!

1005
01:10:51,744 --> 01:10:53,712
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it!

1006
01:10:53,779 --> 01:10:55,713
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

1007
01:10:55,781 --> 01:10:58,375
You were so sure we'd win,
you gave away our spot.

1008
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:00,816
Let us know
how the Dumpster tables are.

1009
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:03,980
- I hear they have gum on them.
- And other unmentionables.

1010
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:05,489
Unmentionables?

1011
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:07,957
I cannot eat on unmentionables.

1012
01:11:31,216 --> 01:11:32,911
How did you know?

1013
01:11:32,985 --> 01:11:34,475
Know?

1014
01:11:35,554 --> 01:11:38,580
About me and you...
and the crown?

1015
01:11:38,657 --> 01:11:40,921
I saw you boarding earlier tonight.

1016
01:11:40,993 --> 01:11:43,757
And then I saw you out there dancing.

1017
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:45,819
It all fit.

1018
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:48,025
And the crown...

1019
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:51,664
By the way,
can I have my boxers back?

1020
01:11:53,672 --> 01:11:55,435
I like your laugh.

1021
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:07,616
- I'm sorry. It might be...
- Go ahead.

1022
01:12:10,756 --> 01:12:13,247
- Hello?
- Where are you guys?

1023
01:12:13,325 --> 01:12:15,293
- Is Mom home?
- Well, no, but she...

1024
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:17,420
<i>hf Dad only krew where Mom
really was tonight...</i>

1025
01:12:17,496 --> 01:12:22,058
<i>Julie. she just called.
She's or her way. So get home. Now.</i>

1026
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:25,035
Who was it? Was it your mom?

1027
01:12:26,338 --> 01:12:29,705
My mom doesn't know we left the house,
and she's on her way home right now.

1028
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:32,573
What? She's on her way home?
Let's go!

1029
01:12:32,644 --> 01:12:34,805
Unbelievable as it is, I have to go.

1030
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,370
I'm sorry.

1031
01:12:42,688 --> 01:12:43,677
All right.

1032
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:45,952
Good time.

1033
01:12:48,694 --> 01:12:50,127
I didn't get the kiss.

1034
01:12:50,195 --> 01:12:51,184
What?

1035
01:12:52,197 --> 01:12:53,960
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

1036
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:56,729
and realize that I'm just
some average little freshman.

1037
01:12:56,802 --> 01:12:59,168
I had my chance, and I missed it.

1038
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:02,401
Whoo! Crank it!

1039
01:13:02,474 --> 01:13:03,463
Whoo!

1040
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:04,531
Yeah!

1041
01:13:05,544 --> 01:13:08,012
We should do this once a week.

1042
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:11,671
My crown!

1043
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:14,514
Hey, tiny green car!

1044
01:13:19,558 --> 01:13:20,991
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1045
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,722
I am commandeering this car
in the name of PatrolTec Security.

1046
01:13:23,796 --> 01:13:26,993
Please evacuate... hey! Hey!
I am a security officer!

1047
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:28,590
I took a two-week course!

1048
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:39,909
Hi, Mom, could you pick me up?
I'm on the corner of Union and Grant.

1049
01:13:39,978 --> 01:13:42,242
L-I really don't want to talk about it.

1050
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,487
What are we gonna do?

1051
01:13:54,593 --> 01:13:55,787
Come on!

1052
01:13:57,796 --> 01:13:59,195
The fort!

1053
01:13:59,264 --> 01:14:01,323
- What?
- Trust me.

1054
01:14:14,313 --> 01:14:16,304
Come on! Come on!

1055
01:14:16,381 --> 01:14:17,370
Get up.

1056
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,709
Catch it!

1057
01:14:31,463 --> 01:14:33,158
Julie, what are you doing?

1058
01:14:33,232 --> 01:14:35,359
- Julie, no.
- You're gonna fall!

1059
01:14:35,434 --> 01:14:37,425
- Julie!
- She's gonna fall!

1060
01:14:46,512 --> 01:14:47,740
Oh, my God!

1061
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:51,206
You guys, help!

1062
01:14:59,358 --> 01:15:00,916
Julie, are you okay?

1063
01:15:00,993 --> 01:15:02,358
What about you?

1064
01:15:03,428 --> 01:15:04,918
Just go.

1065
01:15:04,997 --> 01:15:07,591
Hey, come on, let's go.

1066
01:15:09,368 --> 01:15:11,233
Take care. Thanks for driving.

1067
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:14,864
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, girls.

1068
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:17,500
- You forgot your scarf.
- Thank you.

1069
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:32,681
Hi.

1070
01:15:32,858 --> 01:15:34,348
Hi.

1071
01:15:34,426 --> 01:15:36,917
So, how was the party?

1072
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:38,326
Quiet.

1073
01:15:39,398 --> 01:15:40,490
Quiet?

1074
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:45,898
Wait. I want to
show you something. Come here.

1075
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:52,432
This is our old water. Have a taste.

1076
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:56,609
- Okay?
- Okay.

1077
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:59,242
Now try our brand-new water.

1078
01:16:05,524 --> 01:16:06,786
Honey...

1079
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:09,986
this definitely tastes better.

1080
01:16:10,062 --> 01:16:12,530
- Oh, gosh.
- Thank you.

1081
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:17,490
- Did you have fun at the club?
- I did, but I missed you.

1082
01:16:17,569 --> 01:16:19,764
Everybody needs
a night out now and then.

1083
01:16:19,838 --> 01:16:21,863
You know what? They do.

1084
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,601
Let's go check on the girls.

1085
01:16:23,675 --> 01:16:24,664
Okay.

1086
01:16:26,445 --> 01:16:28,140
Assume sleep positions!

1087
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,902
Told ya. No problem.

1088
01:17:06,985 --> 01:17:09,317
- What's with him?
- I don't know.

1089
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,855
We really did it.

1090
01:17:17,929 --> 01:17:22,195
My Cinderella night,
and I'm still the ugly stepsister.

1091
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:33,569
Ladies, time to get up.

1092
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:35,670
There's gonna be pancakes!

1093
01:17:39,384 --> 01:17:41,352
How long were we asleep?

1094
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,580
Ten minutes.

1095
01:17:43,655 --> 01:17:45,748
Funny. Feels like five.

1096
01:17:49,828 --> 01:17:52,661
You know, I always knew
that old fort would come down one day.

1097
01:17:52,731 --> 01:17:54,961
I just didn't think it would
take the arbor down with it.

1098
01:17:55,934 --> 01:17:58,425
Hey, this water's not so bad, Dad.

1099
01:17:58,503 --> 01:17:59,936
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1100
01:18:00,005 --> 01:18:00,994
Well, thank you.

1101
01:18:02,007 --> 01:18:03,907
What are we gonna do
about the backyard?

1102
01:18:04,976 --> 01:18:07,672
You might be on your own there, Dad.

1103
01:18:07,746 --> 01:18:10,374
I've decided to go back to college.

1104
01:18:12,651 --> 01:18:14,016
That's great.

1105
01:18:14,086 --> 01:18:16,111
Yeah, I mean, last night
kinda got me to thinking,

1106
01:18:16,188 --> 01:18:17,849
you know, high school rocked,

1107
01:18:17,923 --> 01:18:21,051
but it's time to leave it to sis.

1108
01:18:21,126 --> 01:18:24,152
I think I may have
a career ahead in surveillance.

1109
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:26,663
I hear PatrolTec has an opening.

1110
01:18:29,868 --> 01:18:31,335
So...

1111
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:36,607
exactly what
did you girls do last night?

1112
01:18:37,175 --> 01:18:38,574
Exactly?

1113
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,972
Exactly.

1114
01:18:46,685 --> 01:18:48,152
Here's the thing, Mom.

1115
01:18:50,222 --> 01:18:51,553
The thing is...

1116
01:18:53,892 --> 01:18:56,258
We left the house,

1117
01:18:56,328 --> 01:19:01,129
but I assure you, it was for
a very important adolescent cause.

1118
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,359
Adolescent?

1119
01:19:04,403 --> 01:19:06,462
As in "growing up"?

1120
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:08,870
Is that so hard to believe?

1121
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,464
Yes, it is,

1122
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:15,343
because not too long ago
I had a little girl who took ballet.

1123
01:19:15,414 --> 01:19:17,473
She did magic tricks.

1124
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:21,144
We used to bake together
in her Easy-Bake oven,

1125
01:19:21,219 --> 01:19:24,552
and she loved ponies and ladybugs.

1126
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:28,453
I remember her.

1127
01:19:28,527 --> 01:19:32,395
I guess I missed the bridge
between ladybugs and boys.

1128
01:19:33,965 --> 01:19:36,058
I think I'm still standing on that bridge.

1129
01:19:41,072 --> 01:19:43,540
You take your time crossing it.

1130
01:19:43,608 --> 01:19:45,200
Got you something.

1131
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:54,315
A doorknob?

1132
01:19:54,386 --> 01:19:56,183
With a lock.

1133
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:02,253
<i>To the unstoppable freshmer.</i>

1134
01:20:02,327 --> 01:20:04,022
Unstoppable!

1135
01:20:08,633 --> 01:20:11,363
- That's my mom.
- She's giving me a ride.

1136
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:14,361
I have to get home
and finish packing.

1137
01:20:17,309 --> 01:20:19,607
- Bye!
- Bye!

1138
01:20:19,678 --> 01:20:21,077
Bye!

1139
01:20:21,146 --> 01:20:23,444
- I had a fun time!
- Thank you!

1140
01:20:32,691 --> 01:20:36,218
So... this is it.

1141
01:20:37,362 --> 01:20:39,592
You're really moving.

1142
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:44,232
Everything changes now.

1143
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:46,532
Everything would have changed anyway.

1144
01:20:47,873 --> 01:20:49,864
Last night did that.

1145
01:20:51,943 --> 01:20:54,468
Tell me how the view is
from the lunch spot.

1146
01:20:55,547 --> 01:20:57,572
If we sit there.

1147
01:20:57,649 --> 01:20:58,741
What do you mean?

1148
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:02,617
Wherever we sit,
