1
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:42,853
Yes.

2
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,829
Of course.

3
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:48,390
Yes.

4
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:50,365
Yes, of course.

5
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:54,979
No, trust me.
Now's the time to sell.

6
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,107
All the collectors
will be at the antique fair.

7
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:03,815
It's only a first estimate.

8
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:07,427
Sorry, I'll have to call you back.

9
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:09,735
My client just got here.

10
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:53,222
Please be seated.

11
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:00,174
Today the Lord welcomes you home

12
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,305
Patrick

13
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:05,417
but you aren't alone.

14
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:08,779
Your family and friends -

15
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,950
all your friends - are with you.

16
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,808
The loyalty,

17
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,942
the kindness that you always showed

18
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:19,282
to all your friends

19
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:22,894
they're here today
to commemorate it.

20
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,164
For those who wish,

21
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:32,019
there is a memorial book to sign.

22
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,143
Thank you, madame.

23
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,189
Thank you, madame.

24
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:46,389
Thank you for coming.
Patrick liked you.

25
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:48,846
And I liked him.

26
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,473
He was an outstanding collector.

27
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:56,782
Which reminds me. He mentioned
a bureau that might interest me.

28
00:03:56,857 --> 00:04:00,818
- The Majorelle?
- That's it. Could I see it?

29
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,257
Come to the house whenever you like.

30
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:06,552
- Life goes on, right?
- Life goes on.

31
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:09,205
I'll come by tomorrow. Be strong.

32
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:28,435
Hi, how are you?

33
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,335
Hi, George.

34
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:35,860
- Hello.
- The sale's started!

35
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,073
Sorry. They went the whole hog.

36
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:42,616
- Sorry. How was it?
- Funereal. Let me see the catalogue.

37
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:45,623
Which number?
How high would you go?

38
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:47,451
- 15?
- 20.

39
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,229
- It's only a lamp.
- We'll sell it for twice that.

40
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:54,395
Sold to the lady at the back
for 17,000 euros.

41
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:57,335
Now, a small change of program.

42
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,996
Lot 211has been withdrawn,

43
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:04,474
so we'll pass straight to Lot 212.

44
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:13,245
Which 16th-century
French agronomist...

45
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:15,225
Hi, Roger!

46
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,968
...introduced silk manufacture?

47
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,418
He launched the silk industry

48
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:28,446
that flourished throughout France.

49
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:31,940
Olivier de Serres! I know it.

50
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,916
Button it, bookworm.

51
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,567
- Olivier de Serres!
- There's no mayo on my egg.

52
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,998
It's a hard-bald egg!

53
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:46,017
- You know why it's called "mayonnaise"?
- He's at it again!

54
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:50,562
It was named after Port Mahon,
captured by France in 1755.

55
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,607
Mahon, mahonnaise...

56
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,983
Bruno! You're a bore!

57
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:56,937
I'm not. It's interesting.

58
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:59,969
Eat it while it's hot.

59
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:03,720
This Greek terracotta vase

60
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:06,175
from the 5th century B.C.

61
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,836
is a moving relic of a friendship.

62
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:11,143
The inscription says,

63
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:15,173
"He who commissioned it,
grieving for his dearest friend,

64
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:18,146
"filled this vase with tears

65
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,970
"and placed it in his tomb."

66
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:24,168
Starting price, 50,000 euros.
On the phone?

67
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:26,692
60,000.

68
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:27,627
70.

69
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:28,971
- 70,000.
- 80,000.

70
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,071
- 80,000.
- 90,000.

71
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,091
90,000.

72
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,436
Anything on the phone?

73
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,259
I'm bid 90,000.

74
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:39,531
100,000.

75
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,974
110,000.

76
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,429
120,000.

77
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,227
Any more bids?

78
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,343
150,000!

79
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:51,021
150,000.
150,000 for the gentleman.

80
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,945
160,000.

81
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:55,945
No more bids?

82
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,806
- 170!
- Stop it!

83
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:00,558
- You bid, madame?
- No, sorry.

84
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:03,442
The gentleman's bid
stands at 170,000.

85
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,546
170,000...

86
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:07,244
180,000.

87
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:08,330
You're out, sir?

88
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:11,469
Yes, sir? 190,000!

89
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,538
200,000.

90
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:19,732
200,000 euros!

91
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,455
200,000 euros?

92
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,493
No? 200,000. Any more bids?

93
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,859
200,000 for that gentleman.

94
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,583
Sold for 200,000.

95
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,372
Congratulations. A fine purchase.

96
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:35,791
Moving on to the next lot...

97
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:42,865
228,700 euros!

98
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:45,174
Including commission.

99
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,366
Étienne Delamotte.

100
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,303
- The TV producer.
- Here, I'm an antiques collector.

101
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:54,800
François Coste, dealer.

102
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,013
1930s, Deco and tribal art.

103
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:59,636
- So why do you want my vase?
- Yours?

104
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:03,154
- It belongs in my collection.
- You should have bid up.

105
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:05,202
You think you can buy everything?

106
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,828
- It's the law of the market.
- The market!

107
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,907
- Have a heart!
- How much?

108
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,698
- What?
- For a heart. How much?

109
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:15,448
Did you bring packaging
for the vase?

110
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,938
- No. Why?
- It's very fragile.

111
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:20,948
Then deliver it to my place.

112
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:22,298
OK.

113
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,884
- Your place?
- Where would it go in the gallery?

114
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,154
Tell me you bought it
for a collector.

115
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:30,972
- I bought it for me.
- With the gallery's money?

116
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,033
I had to have it. A sudden urge.

117
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:37,308
We're partners 50-50, remember.

118
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:40,310
Relax, we'll work something out.

119
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:42,359
- You want to ruin us?
- It's not that bad.

120
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:46,940
- And if the bank gets tough?
- We'll manage. Don't we always?

121
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,714
See you this evening.

122
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,165
12, Rue de Solferino.

123
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:04,697
- Good evening.
- What?

124
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:06,363
Good evening.

125
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:08,508
Good evening. I'm in a hurry.

126
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:16,451
Solferino. A battle on June 24, 1859.
France defeated Austria.

127
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:19,167
The Red Cross began as a result.

128
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,594
How about that?

129
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:23,972
There, on Avenue Frochot,

130
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,405
Auguste Renoir had his studio.

131
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,285
There, at No. 15,

132
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,001
was the Café du Croissant,

133
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,268
where Jaurès was assassinated
on July 31, 1914,

134
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:38,632
the eve of World War One.

135
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,933
He was eating a strawberry tart.

136
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:42,659
That's important.

137
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,965
It is indeed.

138
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,799
Wait till you hear
what happened today.

139
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:52,353
We met at the auction
to buy a lamp.

140
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,525
He made us buy
an insanely expensive Greek vase.

141
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:59,337
- Is he up on Greek antiques?
- Not at all. What possessed him?

142
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:09,450
Eiffel's grandfather was German.
If he hadn't changed his name,

143
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:13,258
the Eiffel Tower would be called
the Bönickhausen Tower.

144
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:14,986
I'll get out here.

145
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:17,705
- This isn't Rue de Solferino.
- Never mind.

146
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:20,141
I'll walk the rest.

147
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:22,028
- 16 euros.
- Fine.

148
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:23,620
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

149
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:26,084
- Can I have a receipt?
- Yes.

150
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:33,033
By the way, Renoir's studio
wasn't on Avenue Frochot.

151
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:35,339
It was Toulouse Lautrec.

152
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:38,059
- It was? I'll check.
- Do.

153
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,142
- Your friends are here.
- Good, thanks.

154
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:53,864
Hello, everybody.

155
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,313
Hello.

156
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,387
The client says,

157
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:00,590
"It's an old daub
from our country house,

158
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,513
"near Pont-Aven."

159
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,946
I look at the signature.
"P. Go."

160
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:08,046
- Who was this Mr. Go?
- Chinese?

161
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:12,307
A Chinese painter
in 19th-century Brittany?

162
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:14,609
"P. Go" was shorthand
for Paul Gauguin.

163
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,725
Who's she?
Haven't we met before?

164
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:21,936
You never notice people.
Marianne.

165
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:25,106
I introduced you at that opening.

166
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:28,339
Right! Do you know her well?

167
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:31,631
- Very well. She's my girlfriend.
- Your girlfriend?

168
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:34,289
We're together.

169
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,702
You're kidding!

170
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,678
No.

171
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:41,269
Sorry. I'd never have guessed.

172
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:42,710
Guessed what?

173
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:44,665
That I like women.

174
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:49,560
Don't you ever wonder
what I do outside work?

175
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,586
- I respect your privacy.
- You don't give a fuck about other people.

176
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:56,975
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, but it doesn't matter.

177
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:02,870
- You look grim. Birthday blues?
- No, I went to a funeral.

178
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,466
Patrick Bourgoin's.

179
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:06,394
Why? You couldn't stand him.

180
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,849
A little unfinished business...

181
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:13,235
Guess how many we were,
including his widow. Seven!

182
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,731
Well, there'll be fewer at yours.

183
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,234
What?

184
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,586
There'll be nobody.

185
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,215
- You're joking.
- No.

186
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,108
Why did he say that?

187
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,077
- Because you have no friends.
- No friends?

188
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,632
No. How could you?
You only like things.

189
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:34,398
I get it. You're all teasing!

190
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:37,334
Catherine's right.
You have no friends.

191
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:40,476
My appointment diary is full.

192
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,456
Lunches lined up for three weeks!

193
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,082
We're talking friends, not contacts.

194
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:47,041
Real friends you can rely on.

195
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:49,376
- Like a best friend?
- For instance.

196
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,031
Who's yours?

197
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:55,481
I have lots!
Present company, to start with.

198
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:59,330
A best friend isn't a crowd.
So? Who is it?

199
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,337
Why should you know him?

200
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:04,828
I don't carry him around
in my breast pocket.

201
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,624
OK, but who is it?

202
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:10,009
What is this? The Inquisition?

203
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:14,724
- Does he even exist?
- Of course he does!

204
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:17,059
- I don't think so.
- Want to bet?

205
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:19,232
Stop it. You can't bet on that.

206
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:22,402
- He won't let go.
- Same as you!

207
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:24,446
Relax. She didn't mean it.

208
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,079
It's a serious accusation!

209
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:28,704
Accusation?
Don't over dramatize.

210
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:33,054
You'll meet my best friend.
What do you bet?

211
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,759
The vase.

212
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:40,545
- The vase?
- Your Greek vase.

213
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:45,256
If I don't meet your best friend
by the end of this month, it's mine.

214
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:48,355
And if I win? Because I will.

215
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:51,176
- You keep the vase.
- Bet?

216
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:54,789
Bet. You have ten days.

217
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,284
Bertrand, obviously best friend.

218
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:07,266
Let's put Jean-Louis.

219
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,978
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

220
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,997
Rémi, perfect.

221
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,957
Should I stay or go home?

222
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,069
Yes.

223
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:23,045
Yes what?

224
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,981
This is a rare visit.
We barely even talk on the phone.

225
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:31,661
We've talked at least twice a week
and had lunch three times this year.

226
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:33,932
You're keeping count?

227
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,408
- How are you?
- OK.

228
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:38,538
- How's Nathalie?
- Natasha. We're separated.

229
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:39,852
I know.

230
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,769
It's a shame. I liked Natasha.

231
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:47,052
- Where do we put the bureau?
- In the gallery.

232
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:49,643
- And the settee?
- No, the storeroom.

233
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,918
- How old are your kids now?
- Nine and twelve.

234
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:55,336
- Studying what?
- Nothing special yet.

235
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,314
Go ahead.

236
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:02,098
- Why have you come?
- To ask after you. Isn't it natural?

237
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:05,481
No. You never asked before.

238
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:09,998
- Remember our trip to Sicily?
- We happened to be at the same hotel.

239
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,980
And wasn't it fun?

240
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:17,430
The first time we met at an auction,
I felt I'd always known you.

241
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:19,829
- Didn't you?
- I can't remember.

242
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:23,092
Isn't it weird?
We don't see each other for months,

243
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,128
but we pick up
exactly where we left off.

244
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,589
Oh? And where was that?

245
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:31,286
Bertrand, what are you and I?

246
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:33,621
Dealers.

247
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:36,598
Yes, I don't mean...

248
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,945
- Go on.
- More than that, we're

249
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:44,111
friends.
You're my best friend.

250
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:48,086
- Have you regressed to childhood?
- No. Why?

251
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,227
Could have fooled me!

252
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:54,456
You sound like a school kid,
not an adult who steals my clients.

253
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:58,102
Don't get me wrong.
I just wanted to ask you...

254
00:15:58,172 --> 00:15:59,481
OK.

255
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:02,166
Why didn't you say so?
How much?

256
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:06,034
- I'm not here to borrow money.
- It's nothing new.

257
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,070
I always pay you back.
Good reckonings make good friends.

258
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:13,011
Good reckonings
make good reckonings.

259
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,903
You disappoint me, Bertrand.
You were top of my list.

260
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:21,047
You even had a list?

261
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,127
A list of friends?

262
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,128
I'll save you the effort
of asking the others.

263
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
They'll all say the same thing.

264
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,826
NESCAFÉ BREAK...
AMONG FRIENDS

265
00:16:58,565 --> 00:17:01,346
I'm looking for a book.
I'm not sure of the name.

266
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:04,828
I can't find it on the shelves.
It's about

267
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:07,741
how to make friends.

268
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:10,815
- How To Make Friends?
- Yes.

269
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,511
Marc!

270
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,887
Marc!

271
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,326
- How To Make Friends!
- What?

272
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:18,431
How To Make Friends!

273
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:21,537
Do we have any left?
For this gentleman.

274
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:25,504
You're looking for
How To Make Friends?

275
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,169
Yes.

276
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,794
It's on order.
Shall I put one aside?

277
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:30,912
Yeah.

278
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:33,473
What name?

279
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,334
François Coste.

280
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,531
Honest to God!

281
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,835
Excuse me.
Are you two friends?

282
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,275
- Yes.
- How did you do it?

283
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,072
- Do what?
- Become friends.

284
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,083
I don't understand.

285
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:59,564
Me neither.

286
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,728
How did you meet?
What do you have in common?

287
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:06,758
What do you argue about, if you do?
Do you?

288
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:09,255
Excuse me!

289
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:10,887
You didn't answer me.
I'm serious.

290
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:14,123
Will you leave us alone?

291
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:16,101
You should get help!

292
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:35,239
"Friend."
The most common word in the book,

293
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,096
but the rarest thing in reality.

294
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:41,841
The Greeks and Romans
idolized friendship.

295
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:45,704
Over the centuries,
other values displaced it,

296
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,096
but in today's insecure world,
where our jobs, families,

297
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:52,402
and governments
no longer protect us,

298
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:55,534
friendship is back in a big way.

299
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,709
It stands like the last beacon

300
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,571
in a sky that has lost its sun
and not yet found its stars.

301
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:07,600
Many books explain how to make friends
at work, for your advantage,

302
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:10,867
cultivating people
for their usefulness.

303
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,822
True friendship is the opposite.

304
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,893
It is priceless.

305
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:19,921
Small gifts can foster friendship.
They can never buy it.

306
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,683
Love is sometimes sold,

307
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:25,205
but friendship, never!

308
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,279
The best way to find a friend...

309
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:30,485
Are you looking for friendship too?

310
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,310
I've tried everything.

311
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:35,247
The want ads, Dial-A-Friend,

312
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:36,696
the internet...

313
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,835
On lonely evenings...

314
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:43,418
Make him feel valued!

315
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:45,622
Make him feel unique,

316
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:48,855
the most important person
in the world.

317
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:57,661
JESUS IS YOUR FRIEND

318
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:27,679
No sign of the vase.

319
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:30,493
They phoned to apologize.

320
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,082
- What's taking so long?
- Paperwork.

321
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,708
The import permit was missing.

322
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:40,734
Tell me, François.

323
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:42,658
Why's it so important to you?

324
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:45,724
To you too.
We bet it, remember?

325
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:47,421
So let's talk about it.

326
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:51,522
- Am I intruding?
- Louise!

327
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:54,589
Hi.

328
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,035
I'll call a cab.

329
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,435
- We're viewing a studio.
- She's leaving me!

330
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:02,146
I'm only staying in Paris
until I get my degree.

331
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:04,254
Doesn't Bordeaux have a university?

332
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:06,465
Yes, but it's not the Louvre School.

333
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:08,542
Will the studio be OK?

334
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,836
- You won't be living in it.
- So why ask my opinion?

335
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,751
- You'll be paying.
- No kidding!

336
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,572
François.

337
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,876
No taxis available.

338
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:24,130
- I've got my bus pass.
- I don't.

339
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,892
Leave it to me.

340
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,495
Hello.

341
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:47,623
- We can't go on meeting like this!
- You called me. Where to?

342
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:51,467
- Rue des Francs-Bourgeois, please.
- Francs-Bourgeois, here we come.

343
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:54,829
A very old street.
The Revolutionaries renamed it...

344
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,709
- We don't care.
- We do!

345
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,115
Tell us.

346
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:02,379
Rue des Francs-Citoyens.
"Bourgeois" was passé.

347
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:06,189
They got it wrong.
The Francs-Bourgeois weren't bourgeois.

348
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:08,710
Just like the Earl of Sandwich

349
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:11,052
didn't invent the sandwich,

350
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:13,989
and a black box is actually orange.

351
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,144
- It's getting bad.
- Leave me alone!

352
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:21,736
You really ought to see a doctor.

353
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,270
- Need a specialist?
- No!

354
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:25,102
- Why?
- A client of mine

355
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:28,618
consults a top asthma doctor.

356
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,276
- I could get his name.
- I see.

357
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:32,873
You set this up!

358
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:35,368
- Me?
- You two knew each other!

359
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:37,708
- Let me out.
- Drive on.

360
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:39,306
- Let me out!
- Drive on!

361
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,938
Sweetheart!

362
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:55,887
Don't sweat it. It happens.

363
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,649
What happens?

364
00:22:57,718 --> 00:22:59,758
Lovers' tiffs.
With your age gap...

365
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:04,366
An age gap between parent and child
is pretty essential.

366
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:06,544
I apologize.

367
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:13,778
You were right
about Avenue Frochot.

368
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:17,837
Jean Renoir, the painter's son, lived there.
My mistake.

369
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,523
Which crime writer's pen name
was Gom Gut?

370
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:24,441
It was...

371
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,921
- Do you know or not?
- I know. I'm just a bit nervous.

372
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:29,172
Well?

373
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:34,458
He was Belgian, born in 1903,
died in Lausanne in 1989...

374
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:38,713
- He created Maigret.
- That's not the answer.

375
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:41,114
It's coming back...

376
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,067
Georges Simenon!

377
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:44,955
Sorry.

378
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,501
Which country won
the 1954 World Cup?

379
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:50,068
1954?

380
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,759
Hungary lost 3-2...

381
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:56,659
Helmut Rahn
scored the winning goal.

382
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,905
Give me the country,
not a full replay.

383
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:01,845
Which Frenchman acted in
The Man Who Knew Too Much?

384
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:05,754
- Trick question?
- No.

385
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:08,923
Yes. Hitchcock filmed it twice, right?

386
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:12,374
The 1956 version.

387
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:16,474
- In 1934 it was Pierre Fresnay.
- That's not the answer.

388
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,511
It's on the tip of my tongue!

389
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:23,546
He acted in Saints Alive.
He wrote gardening books!

390
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:26,231
Mr. Balanchine, we'll call you.

391
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:28,095
I blew it, right?

392
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:31,808
- We have more candidates to see.
- Of course. Thank you.

393
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:38,976
It was Daniel Gélin!

394
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:43,194
Goodbye.

395
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:46,879
- Didn't we try him before?
- More than once.

396
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:49,405
- He knows it all.
- Who cares?

397
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:51,813
For a show called Know-It-All?

398
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:56,831
- He's the man who knew too much.
- By far. See how he fell apart with us?

399
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:59,358
Imagine him with a live audience.

400
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,400
Monsieur Coste?

401
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:06,301
- Your delivery.
- I was getting worried.

402
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,724
- Where do you want it?
- Through there.

403
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:19,558
Sign, please.

404
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:24,098
I often wonder why
they call you porters Savoyards.

405
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,664
No idea, sir.

406
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,593
Here...

407
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:29,219
Thanks.

408
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,681
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

409
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:52,612
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, son.

410
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,345
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi, dear.

411
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:56,586
Tell us, how did it go?

412
00:25:56,654 --> 00:26:01,957
- Some pretty good fares.
- But did they pick you for Know-It-All?

413
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:04,104
I don't think so.

414
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:08,551
How come?
Didn't you answer right?

415
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:11,275
- Did you take your tranquilizers?
- I don't like to.

416
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:15,207
They make me feel all hot and cold.

417
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:18,249
Can't they make allowances
for nerves?

418
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:19,566
Thank you.

419
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,088
Night, Ma.

420
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,896
See you, son.
Get home safely.

421
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:30,152
Drive carefully!

422
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,889
What can I say?

423
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,262
- Can we go?
- We just got here!

424
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,573
I can't bear all these people.

425
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,511
- Can't you make an effort?
- No.

426
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:18,262
- I can see why you have no friends.
- Don't you start.

427
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:29,712
- Sorry!
- It's occupied!

428
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:32,118
Sorry to phone you so late...

429
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:34,806
Our helpline is open 24 hours.

430
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:36,852
How can I help you?

431
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:39,259
Not me. A friend.

432
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:43,962
A friend? It's OK, most people
who call Dial-A-Friend are like you.

433
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,550
- Like me?
- They have no friends.

434
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:50,004
I have plenty of friends!
I even made a list.

435
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:51,355
- No!
- No what?

436
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:53,626
I wasn't saying "No" to you.

437
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:55,604
What's your idea
of the perfect friend?

438
00:27:55,678 --> 00:27:58,613
I don't care.
I just need one by the 31st.

439
00:27:58,686 --> 00:28:00,443
Why's that?

440
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,902
I just have to.

441
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,906
Can I help?

442
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:39,358
Why do you always refuse help?

443
00:28:41,477 --> 00:28:45,472
- What are you looking for?
- A piece of paper. A list.

444
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,092
It's personal.

445
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:52,893
And what are we?

446
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:55,585
What do you mean?

447
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:58,209
Where are you and I going?

448
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,979
Fine.

449
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,311
We'll talk when you're less busy.
Good night.

450
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:12,862
Good night.

451
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,802
- Right, go.
- No!

452
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:50,378
Mr. Coste? Someone to see you.

453
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:52,388
- Who is it?
- Mr. Ballanchain.

454
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:56,719
- I don't know him.
- He knows you. Says it's important.

455
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,310
See ya, pal.

456
00:29:58,384 --> 00:30:00,686
- Thanks for the help.
- Anytime.

457
00:30:02,128 --> 00:30:04,943
- Sorry to bother you.
- You're Mr. Ballanchain?

458
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:07,856
- At your service.
- Ballanchain, as in "ball and..."

459
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:13,191
No, it's Balanchine.
Like the choreographer.

460
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:17,194
Sorry about your daughter.
I shot my mouth off.

461
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,335
- Is she here?
- You came to see her?

462
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:25,073
- No. You left this in my taxi.
- Ah! I searched everywhere. Thanks.

463
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:28,009
I guessed it was
a list of clients or...

464
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,729
Nice place.

465
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:35,985
Business slow?
Your shop seems pretty empty.

466
00:30:36,052 --> 00:30:40,177
It's not a shop, it's a gallery.
Of antiques.

467
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:42,961
I'm into old stuff too.

468
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,971
I love a good flea market.

469
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:48,395
I also collect. Panini stickers.

470
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,847
1958-78.

471
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:57,810
I have them all except one.
Pelé the King.

472
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:00,498
If you or a colleague sees one...

473
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:04,594
- Anyone you know.
- We might.

474
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:08,658
I just learned a new fact.
Why are they called Savoyards?

475
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:11,733
- No idea.
- 'Cause they come from Savoy!

476
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:13,743
Napoleon III started it

477
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:17,273
when he annexed Savoy to France.

478
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:19,095
Isn't that amazing?

479
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:21,072
I'll be off.

480
00:31:22,107 --> 00:31:24,016
See you, maybe.

481
00:31:51,936 --> 00:31:53,692
Wait!

482
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:57,525
Can I ask you a question?

483
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,382
Any subject except hard rock.
It's not my thing.

484
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:03,613
Not that. Did you know
those Savoyards before?

485
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:05,174
We just met.

486
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:08,413
- And the dachshund?
- First time I saw it. Why?

487
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:11,068
- What are you doing for lunch?
- Eating.

488
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,698
Good! Me too.

489
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:17,755
Can I ask you something?

490
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:21,122
Sure, if it's up my street.

491
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:23,905
I'm trying to find some friends.

492
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:27,201
I mean I'm looking for old friends

493
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:31,131
who would help me out of a jam.

494
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:34,916
And who, if I should pass away,

495
00:32:35,814 --> 00:32:37,885
would attend my funeral.

496
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:41,506
You'd be there, for one!

497
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:45,766
Why do you need to find them?

498
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,805
I have my reasons.

499
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:51,108
What's the point of having
a crowd at your funeral?

500
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:58,949
Some people can't play sports.
I can't make friends.

501
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:00,805
Right. So?

502
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:04,359
I want to be like you.

503
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:06,945
- Like me?
- Yes. I've noticed.

504
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:10,247
You mix well, even with strangers.
How do you do it?

505
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:14,245
I don't know.

506
00:33:14,316 --> 00:33:16,454
You have to be sociable.

507
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:19,556
- Meaning?
- If you don't know, forget it.

508
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:22,506
Don't you think I'm sociable?

509
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:26,795
Not really. No offense!

510
00:33:27,532 --> 00:33:29,507
Teach me to be sociable!

511
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:33,737
- It can't be taught.
- There must be a trick to it.

512
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,075
Teach me, please. I'll pay you.

513
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:38,887
You're joking!

514
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,805
No, I'm not. I never joke.

515
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:44,358
That's your first mistake.

516
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:48,043
OK, let's try.

517
00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:51,951
That's a big bag.
Is someone meeting you off the train?

518
00:33:52,015 --> 00:33:54,601
My grandson. He's a real cutie.

519
00:33:54,672 --> 00:33:56,560
Not as cute as his grandma!

520
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:58,052
What's his name?

521
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:01,030
- Erwan.
- That's Breton for Yves.

522
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,480
Right!

523
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:05,513
- You know Brittany?
- A bit. Where are you from?

524
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:06,699
Paimpol.

525
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,190
<i>I love Paimpol, its cliffs</i>

526
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:12,714
<i>- Its church, the pilgrimage...
- I don't know it.</i>

527
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:15,470
<i>But above all,
I love the girl from Paimpol</i>

528
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:19,249
<i>Who waits for me in Brittany</i>

529
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,886
There you go, my dear.

530
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:29,363
Your bag.

531
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:32,745
- Are you always so jolly?
- Smile and the world smiles with you.

532
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,210
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, madame.

533
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,969
Did you like lesson one?

534
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:40,405
Come with me. I need a toaster.

535
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:46,320
Stand here
and tell me where I go wrong.

536
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:50,317
Good afternoon.

537
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:51,766
I'm looking for a toaster.

538
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:56,050
- What do you recommend?
- This one's good.

539
00:34:58,713 --> 00:34:59,760
Hello.

540
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:03,280
- Can I help?
- I need a toaster that defrosts.

541
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:06,388
- This one's best.
- Does it defrost?

542
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:11,509
- Did you see this one?
- I like this one.

543
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:14,612
Dear me! I can't decide.

544
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:17,531
I'll think about it.
Thanks. Goodbye.

545
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:23,260
- See? They liked me.
- Naturally. You're a customer.

546
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:25,626
But we hit it off. Don't deny it.

547
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,602
You really don't get it.

548
00:35:27,676 --> 00:35:30,230
My parents would love one of these.

549
00:35:30,301 --> 00:35:32,756
- I'll buy it for them.
- No. No.

550
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:35,317
- Watch your braking distance.
- What?

551
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,008
We're on the meter,
not the wheel of fortune.

552
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,387
There are plenty of ways
to be sociable.

553
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:45,310
Just stay on your toes.

554
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,285
And smile.

555
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:53,884
Hello.

556
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,020
Madame.

557
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:02,457
- They all look miserable.
- So cheer them up!

558
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,791
Hello!

559
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:15,803
An espresso, please.

560
00:36:18,884 --> 00:36:21,273
- Roger!
- No. It's on me.

561
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:27,006
This whole round is on me.

562
00:36:47,111 --> 00:36:49,021
I blew it again.

563
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,005
What went wrong?

564
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:54,532
- You said, "It's on me."
- Yes.

565
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,448
- Who is "me"?
- Me!

566
00:36:57,513 --> 00:37:02,337
They don't know you. You can't buy
people drinks until they know you.

567
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:04,745
It's weird.
For you, it's automatic.

568
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,079
I thought I'd got it.

569
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:10,245
There's nothing to get.
Just be yourself.

570
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,809
Sociable, smiling...

571
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:13,857
OK, to sum it up.

572
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,720
Sociable, smiling.

573
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:18,822
And sincere.
Sincerity's essential.

574
00:37:18,893 --> 00:37:21,227
The magic formula! I knew it!

575
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:23,081
Three Ss. Sociable.

576
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:24,774
Smiling.

577
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:26,438
Sincere.

578
00:37:26,765 --> 00:37:28,075
If you like.

579
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:29,965
- No?
- Yes...

580
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,725
Sociable, smiling, sincere.

581
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:37,220
I'll watch you.

582
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:32,273
- "Live and learn," my dad says.
- Why should I be sociable with strangers?

583
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:34,448
Who do you want to be sociable with?

584
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,642
- People I know. Friends.
- I didn't think you had any.

585
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,816
One is all I need.

586
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:43,157
Is there nobody
you could call at 3am?

587
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:45,265
Nobody!

588
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:48,119
- Even if you had a big problem?
- I don't.

589
00:38:48,185 --> 00:38:50,999
You do. You have nobody
to call at 3am!

590
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:53,913
- Where next?
- Nowhere. I've had enough.

591
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:56,977
- Shall I run you back?
- I need a walk.

592
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:58,992
- What do I owe?
- Pay me tomorrow.

593
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:01,171
I said I've had enough.

594
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:03,576
You can't just give up
and walk away.

595
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,716
Someone's waiting for you
somewhere.

596
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:07,990
Who? Where?

597
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:10,361
Me, tomorrow, outside your door.

598
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,497
What if I don't answer?

599
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,506
I'll wait. I'm a taxi driver.

600
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,809
Our cash flow's still tight.

601
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,275
The bank is threatening...

602
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,687
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

603
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,518
I have to say you're slacking off.

604
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:36,860
Missing appointments,
cruising town in a taxi...

605
00:39:36,928 --> 00:39:40,244
I know you hate driving
in Paris, but still.

606
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,582
Lost your bet?

607
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,241
No!

608
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,460
- Only three more days.
- I know.

609
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:58,042
- Eating out tonight?
- Yes, with friends.

610
00:39:58,114 --> 00:40:01,410
- Want to come?
- No, I'm going out too.

611
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:05,471
I'd hate to think of you
all alone at home.

612
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,901
What are you doing in the dark?

613
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,426
I'm with my friend.

614
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:41,340
Who?

615
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:43,843
My only friend.

616
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:46,974
Are you drunk?

617
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:51,331
- Where were you?
- Get off my case.

618
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,369
I care about you, that's all.

619
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:55,904
That's new.

620
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:58,761
That's a mean thing to say, darling.

621
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:05,730
Achilles and Patroclus.

622
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:09,380
From the Iliad.
Legendary friends

623
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:12,040
through thick and thin.

624
00:41:17,485 --> 00:41:19,395
Good night.

625
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,736
Good morning.

626
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:55,949
- You're looking better today.
- Yes.

627
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,572
- You were right. I've found him.
- Found?

628
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:02,189
My best friend.
Right underneath my nose.

629
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:04,680
His name is Luc.

630
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,065
Luc Lebinet.

631
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,037
So, where to?

632
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,019
Nogent-sur-Marne.

633
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:12,499
This is it!

634
00:42:13,108 --> 00:42:15,116
- If you say so.
- I'm sure.

635
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,388
My long-lost buddy.

636
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,092
That's the place.

637
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:27,632
He'll be so surprised.
My best friend at age 11.

638
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:30,158
Look, that's him. Lebinet.

639
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:32,817
- A childhood friend?
- Yeah.

640
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:34,578
They're the most loyal.

641
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:38,453
Lebinet.

642
00:42:41,912 --> 00:42:44,301
Funny, he's hardly changed.

643
00:42:49,018 --> 00:42:52,281
- Why not talk to him?
- I want him to think it's chance.

644
00:42:52,347 --> 00:42:55,608
- What do we do?
- Follow them.

645
00:43:04,476 --> 00:43:06,298
Thanks.

646
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:07,770
Thanks for everything.

647
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,046
Shouldn't I wait?

648
00:43:09,116 --> 00:43:12,466
No. He's bound to invite me home
for a long chat.

649
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,933
Bye.

650
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,085
Lebinet!

651
00:43:41,153 --> 00:43:43,771
Incredible. Remember me?

652
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:45,117
No.

653
00:43:45,184 --> 00:43:48,447
Coste. François Coste!
Carnot Junior High.

654
00:43:48,513 --> 00:43:50,848
Sixth grade.

655
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:53,086
Coste? Yeah, right.

656
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:54,584
Goodbye.

657
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:56,896
Lebinet!

658
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,169
- Sir?
- I have nothing.

659
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:00,926
Luc!

660
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:03,516
Wait! Wait for me.

661
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:06,555
You bought quiche?
My favorite food!

662
00:44:06,628 --> 00:44:10,241
You used to call me "Quichie" at school,
remember?

663
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:11,453
It's a sign!

664
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:14,656
Let's eat it together.
You can introduce me to your family.

665
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:16,962
Get lost!

666
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:21,052
Luc!

667
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:25,502
We were best friends.
You can't have forgotten!

668
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:27,779
I haven't forgotten.

669
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:31,044
We were worst enemies.
I thought you were a creep.

670
00:44:31,111 --> 00:44:34,079
Everybody did.
The whole class loathed you.

671
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:36,485
You were a smug little shit then,

672
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:38,854
and I see you still are.

673
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,928
C'mon. He's not your sort.

674
00:44:41,001 --> 00:44:42,889
Schmuck!

675
00:44:42,953 --> 00:44:46,117
- You waited?
- I smelled a rat.

676
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:48,706
Childhood friendships don't last.

677
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:51,047
Sit in the front.

678
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:04,486
Same old story.
You meet people, get close to them,

679
00:45:04,556 --> 00:45:06,498
then they're gone.

680
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:08,296
Friendship's a myth.

681
00:45:08,364 --> 00:45:12,293
Look who's talking.
You make friends with everyone.

682
00:45:12,365 --> 00:45:15,365
Everybody's the same as nobody.

683
00:45:15,437 --> 00:45:18,437
Believe me. We're always alone.

684
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:44,176
Monsieur Coste?

685
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,631
- Hello.
- Voilà.

686
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:50,896
Fill in the amount you want, my friend.

687
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:53,551
I'm not selling.

688
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:56,337
I'm set on having that vase.

689
00:45:56,404 --> 00:45:58,859
I'm set on keeping it, my friend.

690
00:46:00,084 --> 00:46:02,473
- You don't understand. I'm offering...
- No, no, no.

691
00:46:02,548 --> 00:46:05,069
You don't understand. I said no.

692
00:46:06,165 --> 00:46:09,066
You really don't deserve it.

693
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:21,457
Aren't Sundays a drag?

694
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:26,870
Statistically,
more people die on Sundays.

695
00:46:26,935 --> 00:46:30,645
How do you stay alive on Sundays?

696
00:47:03,068 --> 00:47:06,746
Why did the damn ref
allow so much injury time?

697
00:47:07,646 --> 00:47:09,980
Is it the subway that's bugging you?

698
00:47:10,045 --> 00:47:11,735
Got out of the habit?

699
00:47:11,804 --> 00:47:14,707
Me too, but parking is hell
at the stadium.

700
00:47:19,328 --> 00:47:21,083
Remember the three Ss.

701
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:24,185
- Sociable...
- Smiling, yeah...

702
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,868
Dickheads!

703
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:45,663
Aren't you hungry?
Let's grab a bite.

704
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,098
I eat with my parents on Sundays.

705
00:47:48,163 --> 00:47:50,584
Oh, well. Next time.

706
00:47:50,658 --> 00:47:53,245
- No, you can come too.
- You think so?

707
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:56,545
- Won't they...
- You're kidding. We'll take potluck.

708
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,486
- Where do they live?
- The suburbs.

709
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:00,964
There's a direct subway.

710
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:02,554
Subway? No way.

711
00:48:02,628 --> 00:48:04,865
- No?
- No.

712
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:09,828
- It was close back there.
- The subway's always close!

713
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:15,521
- Thanks.
- Bye.

714
00:48:18,279 --> 00:48:20,319
Your suburb's pretty.

715
00:48:20,391 --> 00:48:22,595
Why wouldn't it be?

716
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:24,965
They live here and I live there.

717
00:48:25,031 --> 00:48:28,774
- You can't cut the cord?
- It's them, not me.

718
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,255
- Drove my wife crazy.
- So, you're married?

719
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:34,533
Me, yes. Her, not so much.

720
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:37,089
- How about you?
- Divorced.

721
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:39,684
My fault, naturally.

722
00:48:39,754 --> 00:48:41,161
You live alone?

723
00:48:41,226 --> 00:48:43,495
Yes, it depends.

724
00:48:43,562 --> 00:48:45,668
Depends on the evening.

725
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:50,497
She lays her eggs,
safe from storm and foe...

726
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:55,498
Evening.

727
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:56,643
- Evening.
- Evening.

728
00:48:56,715 --> 00:48:59,531
François Coste, our dinner guest.

729
00:48:59,596 --> 00:49:03,753
The famous François?
Bruno talks a lot about you.

730
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:05,796
My friend François.

731
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:10,375
My friend Bruno.

732
00:49:11,502 --> 00:49:13,193
Bruno, my friend.

733
00:49:15,054 --> 00:49:17,804
Catherine.
I'm afraid you've lost your bet.

734
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,839
I'm about to have dinner
with my best friend.

735
00:49:20,912 --> 00:49:23,661
Take care, talk to you later.

736
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,914
- I hope you like quiche.
- I could eat it every day.

737
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:29,808
- Here, François.
- Thanks.

738
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:31,434
You've cheered me up.

739
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:34,123
Smile and the world smiles with you.

740
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:36,430
- Here, son.
- Thanks.

741
00:49:36,497 --> 00:49:39,978
- Did you tape Thalassa for me?
- Sure.

742
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,085
- Bruno's a champion mastermind.
- Future champion.

743
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:45,063
Quiz games, you know?

744
00:49:45,138 --> 00:49:48,008
On TV.
Not cereal boxes.

745
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,539
We coach him, see.
We train him.

746
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:54,736
Bruno, get out some good wine
to toast your friend.

747
00:49:54,804 --> 00:49:57,226
How did he get so addicted to facts?

748
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,017
As a kid he collected newspaper articles.

749
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:03,216
"True or False?"
"Amazing Facts!" "Did You Know?"

750
00:50:03,285 --> 00:50:06,417
He followed all the game shows
on the radio and TV.

751
00:50:06,486 --> 00:50:09,170
Some kids idolize rock stars.

752
00:50:09,238 --> 00:50:12,085
His idols were Alex Trebek
and Robert Robinson.

753
00:50:12,695 --> 00:50:15,956
Not that it helped him
pass his exams.

754
00:50:16,022 --> 00:50:19,471
He knew a lot more than the teachers,
but

755
00:50:20,632 --> 00:50:22,575
he fell apart. Nerves.

756
00:50:23,128 --> 00:50:26,389
He has nice manners.
What does he do?

757
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,945
- He's a dealer.
- In what?

758
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:31,701
- Art, furniture...
- Aunt Jacky's!

759
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:33,592
I don't think...

760
00:50:33,882 --> 00:50:34,994
Father!

761
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:39,059
I think there's some valuable stuff,
but you're the expert.

762
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,705
Voilà!

763
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:46,353
Yes, yes, yes.

764
00:50:48,732 --> 00:50:51,219
Interesting, this art deco table.

765
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:53,114
I could easily sell it for you.

766
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:56,114
You could?
What's it worth?

767
00:50:56,188 --> 00:50:58,163
About 10,000.

768
00:50:58,237 --> 00:51:00,987
- Francs or cents?
- Euros.

769
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:07,068
Let me think about it.

770
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:12,313
There!

771
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:13,791
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

772
00:51:13,856 --> 00:51:16,408
Your trip wasn't wasted.

773
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:22,262
I haven't had such a happy time in ages.
So glad to have met you.

774
00:51:22,336 --> 00:51:23,679
Us too!

775
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:25,884
You're very sociable.

776
00:51:25,953 --> 00:51:27,577
- Really?
- Yes.

777
00:51:27,648 --> 00:51:29,307
Really very sociable.

778
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:35,642
You have nice parents.

779
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:37,536
Yeah.

780
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:40,734
- What are yours like?
- They're dead.

781
00:51:40,802 --> 00:51:43,388
Shit. I'm sorry.

782
00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:46,460
You have your daughter, though.

783
00:51:46,532 --> 00:51:50,460
I'm worried about Louise.
She's allergic to dust,

784
00:51:50,532 --> 00:51:53,794
but, as you saw,
she refuses to seek treatment.

785
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,683
Girls that age are touchy.

786
00:51:56,453 --> 00:51:59,584
Like, if she wears makeup,
she must have a boyfriend.

787
00:52:00,357 --> 00:52:03,260
But don't ever ask.
Let her confide in you.

788
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:06,683
Her, confide? Not in me, anyhow.

789
00:52:06,758 --> 00:52:09,125
She never even calls me "Dad."

790
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:12,803
- What does she say?
- Nothing. She says nothing.

791
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:15,239
I can't get through to her.

792
00:52:15,304 --> 00:52:17,345
Is she the only one?

793
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:20,646
- Want to put it down?
- I'm OK.

794
00:52:20,712 --> 00:52:23,134
We can keep going...

795
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:26,309
- Can you lift it?
- You lift!

796
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,897
Lift your end. Go on.

797
00:52:29,737 --> 00:52:31,526
Higher.

798
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:33,864
Damn!

799
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:37,226
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

800
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,362
Don't worry? It's a period piece.

801
00:52:39,915 --> 00:52:41,442
- Isn't it?
- Sure.

802
00:52:41,515 --> 00:52:43,523
- Early Woolworths.
- You mean...

803
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,112
- It's not worth a fart?
- Not even that.

804
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,147
- You paid 10,000.
- To make your father happy.

805
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:52,681
You pay to make people happy?

806
00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:54,572
You don't?

807
00:52:55,565 --> 00:52:57,802
- Where do we put it?
- There.

808
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:15,912
Voilà.

809
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:20,806
Your place isn't potluck.
It's the jackpot!

810
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:24,363
Make yourself at home.

811
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:26,059
Here's to friendship.

812
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:29,196
It's unique. 5th century B.C.

813
00:53:29,266 --> 00:53:32,135
A man had it made
in memory of his best friend.

814
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,415
He was inconsolable.

815
00:53:34,483 --> 00:53:36,752
He filled it with his tears.

816
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:38,728
No shit.

817
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:41,006
That's Achilles and Patroclus.

818
00:53:41,074 --> 00:53:43,497
The Iliad.
Achilles and Patroclus.

819
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:47,053
Like Danny Wilde and Brett Sinclair
in The Persuaders!

820
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:49,361
Yeah, kind of.

821
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:53,837
- Time I went home.
- Don't be silly.

822
00:53:53,908 --> 00:53:55,916
We've drunk too much.

823
00:53:55,989 --> 00:53:57,746
I have room for friends.

824
00:53:57,814 --> 00:53:59,920
I'm sure you do

825
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,931
have room.

826
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,614
- Evening.
- Evening.

827
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:19,474
Sorry to just turn up,
but you stopped returning my calls.

828
00:54:19,545 --> 00:54:24,401
Yes. Sorry.
I've been up to my neck.

829
00:54:25,401 --> 00:54:27,224
Can I come in?

830
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,199
Yeah.

831
00:54:31,482 --> 00:54:34,352
- Am I troubling you?
- Not at all.

832
00:54:35,354 --> 00:54:38,355
- Going down-market?
- It was a gift.

833
00:54:41,435 --> 00:54:43,126
- You're not alone?
- Yes.

834
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:46,512
Actually, no. Louise had an attack.
I dialed a friend...

835
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:49,491
I mean, I dialed a doctor.

836
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:51,801
I prefer your silences.

837
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:55,254
But if you call me, I'll answer.

838
00:55:09,663 --> 00:55:11,452
- François?
- Yes?

839
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,222
- Good night.
- Good night.

840
00:55:15,296 --> 00:55:19,257
I think friendship
is the greatest thing.

841
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:21,468
True friendship.

842
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:23,544
It's always pure and open.

843
00:55:24,513 --> 00:55:26,401
Anyway...

844
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:29,658
See you tomorrow.

845
00:55:32,418 --> 00:55:35,266
We hung out, went to a soccer game,

846
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,811
took the subway
and had dinner with his parents.

847
00:55:38,883 --> 00:55:42,146
He's leading you astray!
What does he do?

848
00:55:42,212 --> 00:55:45,113
- Drives a taxi.
- Don't give me that.

849
00:55:45,187 --> 00:55:49,379
We've been friends since we were 11.
He became a taxi driver, so what?

850
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:51,550
And it's useful. I call, he comes.

851
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:55,200
The plumber comes when I call,
but he's not my best friend.

852
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,368
I warn you,
I won't settle for a stand-in.

853
00:55:58,437 --> 00:56:01,472
What will it take to convince you?

854
00:56:01,543 --> 00:56:03,267
What's a best friend to you?

855
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:05,669
I don't know. Let's say...

856
00:56:05,735 --> 00:56:07,907
Someone who'd take risks for me.

857
00:56:07,975 --> 00:56:09,502
What kind of risks?

858
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,463
Have you seen the time?

859
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:14,748
- A big risk?
- Yeah, a big risk.

860
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:19,684
- What's the acid test?
- I'll let you answer that.

861
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:22,023
- Good night.
- Good night.

862
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:36,808
Morning, miss.

863
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:41,131
- I know you, right?
- Yes, I'm your dad's taxi driver.

864
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:42,789
He's catching up on sleep.

865
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,959
Great soccer game.
He cheered his head off.

866
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:49,096
- Who?
- Your father.

867
00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:52,364
- My father, a soccer fan?
- Yeah!

868
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,715
Does he eat butter?

869
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:58,924
No idea.

870
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:04,523
- I was up all night.
- One night is nothing.

871
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:09,807
The sleeplessness record
is held by Randy Gardner from San Diego.

872
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:11,814
In 1965, at 17,

873
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:14,757
he went 264 hours without sleep.

874
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:20,620
- You're a student, right?
- Yeah.

875
00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:22,959
- Of what?
- Asian archaeology.

876
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:25,776
Ruins, the memory of civilizations...

877
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,362
- Do you know...
- Do you ever stop talking?

878
00:57:28,434 --> 00:57:31,980
My wife... My ex says I do it
so people won't hear me.

879
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:43,537
There are pecans in this.
Very bad for you.

880
00:57:43,604 --> 00:57:45,842
I've eaten it all my life!

881
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:47,501
Good reason to stop.

882
00:57:47,572 --> 00:57:51,119
Pecans can cause respiratory allergies.

883
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,907
You care about my health?

884
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:55,698
Your father does.

885
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:58,133
He's really worried.

886
00:57:58,198 --> 00:58:00,817
- Did he tell you?
- Are you surprised?

887
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:02,316
A bit.

888
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:04,880
What's funny about it?

889
00:58:05,497 --> 00:58:07,666
It's true.

890
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:08,979
How are you?

891
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:10,935
I made you breakfast.
Sleep well?

892
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,423
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

893
00:58:18,616 --> 00:58:21,617
How would you define a true friend?

894
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:25,651
- Someone who'll go to the limit for you.
- Such as?

895
00:58:25,722 --> 00:58:28,689
Lend you his cab if yours breaks down...

896
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:30,770
Don't you have...

897
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:39,322
Don't you have a clearer definition?

898
00:58:39,388 --> 00:58:42,171
What's your definition?

899
00:58:42,237 --> 00:58:43,798
A friend

900
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:46,236
is someone who'll take risks for me.

901
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:48,788
- That's not much clearer.
- It is.

902
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,920
If I had big money problems,
my friend would help me out.

903
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:57,726
As it happens, I do.
I'm deep in debt.

904
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:59,895
- And?
- Can I trust you?

905
00:58:59,966 --> 00:59:02,455
- Friends don't ask that.
- You're right.

906
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:07,318
In my business, sometimes
I have to resort to certain schemes.

907
00:59:07,393 --> 00:59:10,359
- Schemes?
- Scams, if you prefer.

908
00:59:10,432 --> 00:59:13,695
The question is,
who can I ask?

909
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:17,374
- You can ask me.
- Even if it's illegal?

910
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,338
- It's like a loan.
- Like how?

911
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:24,344
An art theft. My vase.

912
00:59:24,418 --> 00:59:27,168
- You're gonna steal your vase?
- No, you are.

913
00:59:27,235 --> 00:59:29,536
- And do what with it?
- Keep it.

914
00:59:29,602 --> 00:59:32,538
When the insurance pays up,
I'll take it back.

915
00:59:33,828 --> 00:59:36,249
You said a friend would go to the limit.

916
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,713
Yes, but that's the limit.

917
01:00:57,518 --> 01:00:59,145
There!

918
01:01:00,176 --> 01:01:01,866
Surprise!

919
01:01:01,935 --> 01:01:05,253
Well done.
You can put the vase down.

920
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,230
Meet Bruno,
my best friend.

921
01:01:08,304 --> 01:01:10,793
Sociable, smiling, sincere!

922
01:01:10,865 --> 01:01:13,286
A masterpiece of a best friend.

923
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:16,624
- That's your surprise?
- Nobody got hurt. Right, Bruno?

924
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:19,340
- What the fuck's going on?
- Just a joke.

925
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,988
- A joke?
- See what a risk my best friend took?

926
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:26,321
Faking a theft for the insurance?

927
01:01:26,387 --> 01:01:28,297
How's that for friendship?

928
01:01:28,372 --> 01:01:30,576
On his part, yes. But yours?

929
01:01:30,644 --> 01:01:33,709
- Be a sport. I won the bet, right?
- What bet?

930
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:36,497
Nothing. I'll explain.
Champagne?

931
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:38,803
No, thanks.

932
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,732
Poor François.
You lost before you started.

933
01:01:43,317 --> 01:01:47,441
By making such a stupid bet,
you proved you had no friends.

934
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:50,161
You never did and never will.

935
01:01:51,767 --> 01:01:53,589
Tell her, Bruno.

936
01:01:54,103 --> 01:01:56,657
Tell her you're my best friend.

937
01:01:59,608 --> 01:02:02,259
Don't be like that. It was for fun.

938
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:05,521
For fun?

939
01:02:14,777 --> 01:02:17,528
Where are the tears?

940
01:02:40,829 --> 01:02:43,219
It's not your fault. He stinks.

941
01:03:18,178 --> 01:03:20,896
We've always covered your overdrafts,

942
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:24,826
but, as I said to your partner,
this deficit is excessive.

943
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,873
I'll cover it.

944
01:03:26,946 --> 01:03:29,849
We can't simply take your word for it.

945
01:03:29,924 --> 01:03:31,681
Take my share of the business.

946
01:03:31,748 --> 01:03:33,723
That should cover it easily.

947
01:03:33,797 --> 01:03:37,277
- And your partner?
- She'll manage the gallery solo.

948
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:43,517
- You realize what this means?
- Yes.

949
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,860
It's the price I have to pay.

950
01:04:01,097 --> 01:04:03,486
Mind if I join you?

951
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:11,999
I had a call from Mom.

952
01:04:12,073 --> 01:04:14,824
She asked if you were OK.
I said no.

953
01:04:14,891 --> 01:04:16,898
Was I right?

954
01:04:23,884 --> 01:04:27,179
I'm taking a field course
for my degree.

955
01:04:28,043 --> 01:04:29,767
It'll last a year.

956
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:32,040
Where?

957
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:33,767
Cambodia.

958
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:37,516
- The Angkor temples. It's a dig.
- A dig?

959
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:39,175
With your dust allergy?

960
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:41,483
It's gone. I'm cured.

961
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:47,685
It wasn't dust, it was food.
Your friend saw it at once.

962
01:04:48,366 --> 01:04:49,828
My friend?

963
01:04:49,903 --> 01:04:52,751
Of course. You have no friends.

964
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,238
At the time, I thought

965
01:05:01,137 --> 01:05:04,454
"He's started to care about other people."

966
01:05:06,418 --> 01:05:08,425
But you hadn't.

967
01:05:14,482 --> 01:05:16,392
Poor Bruno.

968
01:05:17,235 --> 01:05:19,471
He fell for it.

969
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:54,451
- Sorry to burst in on you.
- It's a pleasure. Come in.

970
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,408
Hello.

971
01:05:56,472 --> 01:06:00,050
I'm worried about Bruno.
I haven't heard from him.

972
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,895
Neither have we. It's been a week.
Our boy's unhappy.

973
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,961
Did you know
his best friend betrayed him?

974
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:08,757
You heard about it?

975
01:06:08,826 --> 01:06:12,143
And how! He'd known
Jean-Claude since school.

976
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,520
- Jean-Claude?
- The boy next door.

977
01:06:14,586 --> 01:06:16,791
His oldest friend. And closest.

978
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:19,707
They were inseparable. Until

979
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:21,876
J-C ran off with Bruno's wife.

980
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:25,554
- Didn't he tell you?
- He still isn't over it.

981
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:28,084
- Losing his wife or his friend.
- Both!

982
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:30,774
He trusted them.
It was a terrible blow.

983
01:06:30,844 --> 01:06:32,884
These wounds heal slowly.

984
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:34,964
He's still fragile.

985
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:37,591
It was touch and go.

986
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,949
Isn't it cute?

987
01:06:53,023 --> 01:06:56,886
He's been collecting facts
since he was little.

988
01:07:04,226 --> 01:07:08,831
His dream is to be on a TV show,
but they never pick him.

989
01:07:08,898 --> 01:07:11,386
He's unlucky there, too.

990
01:07:17,668 --> 01:07:21,017
To you, I'm just a fox
like any other fox.

991
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,831
But if you tame me,
we'll need each other.

992
01:07:25,605 --> 01:07:28,126
You'll be unique in the world for me.

993
01:07:28,197 --> 01:07:30,880
And I'll be unique in the world for you.

994
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:32,541
THE LITTLE PRINCE

995
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:37,149
Morning, sir.

996
01:08:01,834 --> 01:08:04,681
Found your friend?

997
01:08:04,745 --> 01:08:08,162
What's this? A fake?

998
01:08:08,235 --> 01:08:10,373
No, that's the real one.

999
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:14,186
- I don't follow.
- The delivery was late, right?

1000
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,106
Actually, it wasn't.

1001
01:08:16,171 --> 01:08:19,434
I was having a replica made.

1002
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,093
A perfect copy, right?

1003
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:23,781
Whatever for?

1004
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,445
The copy?

1005
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:31,075
To protect us from the bank.
And I was right.

1006
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:34,216
Your stupid stunt nearly cost us the gallery.

1007
01:08:34,286 --> 01:08:36,391
200,000 euros in smithereens!

1008
01:08:36,461 --> 01:08:38,917
Your trick backfired on you.

1009
01:08:39,598 --> 01:08:42,282
You've learned a lesson. We're even.

1010
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,522
- I lost the bet.
- Forget it.

1011
01:08:44,591 --> 01:08:46,152
It never mattered.

1012
01:08:46,896 --> 01:08:49,164
Did Bruno know it was a fake?

1013
01:08:50,384 --> 01:08:53,199
No, and he thought
his best friend was real.

1014
01:08:58,193 --> 01:09:02,055
You asked about the acid test.
There isn't one.

1015
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:07,180
I forget who said,
"There's no love, only tests of love."

1016
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,389
But the exact opposite is true.

1017
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:12,493
There's no test. There's only love.

1018
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:15,181
- It hurt me.
- What did?

1019
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,386
Your indifference.

1020
01:09:18,452 --> 01:09:21,322
What else would you have wanted?

1021
01:09:21,396 --> 01:09:24,015
I'd have liked to be your friend.

1022
01:09:30,581 --> 01:09:32,404
Excuse me.

1023
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,819
- Mr. Delamotte's office? First floor.
- Thanks.

1024
01:09:39,894 --> 01:09:42,033
You were right.
I didn't deserve it.

1025
01:09:42,102 --> 01:09:44,918
- Yes?
- It's Delamotte.

1026
01:09:44,983 --> 01:09:48,912
I've just received your package.

1027
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,511
I don't understand.

1028
01:09:50,585 --> 01:09:52,624
Simple. You wanted it, it's yours.

1029
01:09:52,696 --> 01:09:55,567
But at what price?

1030
01:09:55,642 --> 01:09:58,424
- I assume you...
- Only what I paid for it.

1031
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:01,785
- Plus a small favor.
- I see.

1032
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,858
A favor one can only ask a friend?

1033
01:10:03,931 --> 01:10:06,418
No, I wouldn't ask you that.

1034
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,814
- Bruno!
- Are you in there?

1035
01:10:09,883 --> 01:10:12,273
- Bruno!
- Bruno!

1036
01:10:12,347 --> 01:10:14,966
- Everybody's looking for you.
- I can't!

1037
01:10:15,741 --> 01:10:19,482
- It's your life's dream.
- I'll never make it.

1038
01:10:19,547 --> 01:10:22,515
- You will. Be brave.
- No!

1039
01:10:22,588 --> 01:10:25,818
On the count of three,
I'll break the door down!

1040
01:10:25,886 --> 01:10:27,674
One! Two!

1041
01:10:27,741 --> 01:10:29,880
Wait!

1042
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:32,470
- What's the matter?
- Your tranquilizer.

1043
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:35,706
- You know it makes me...
- Tranquil. Come on.

1044
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:37,399
Time to go now.

1045
01:10:46,592 --> 01:10:48,828
- Which one?
- In gray.

1046
01:10:50,369 --> 01:10:52,988
Mr. Balanchine?
Étienne Delamotte.

1047
01:10:53,057 --> 01:10:55,741
I produce the show. Good luck.

1048
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:58,045
No harm in it.

1049
01:10:58,112 --> 01:11:00,502
- The same to you all, naturally.
- Thank you.

1050
01:11:00,578 --> 01:11:05,336
Bruno was picked out of a hat to fill in,
they said. Is that right?

1051
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:07,419
That's right.

1052
01:11:07,492 --> 01:11:10,458
Everybody on set! Showtime!

1053
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:14,266
You're on, son.

1054
01:11:20,165 --> 01:11:21,180
Good evening.

1055
01:11:21,252 --> 01:11:25,311
Good evening and welcome to
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

1056
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:29,855
Hopefully one of you will answer
all the questions, using three lifelines

1057
01:11:34,599 --> 01:11:38,308
and end up winning one million euros!

1058
01:11:38,376 --> 01:11:42,085
The fastest finger takes the hot seat.
That means Bruno!

1059
01:11:42,152 --> 01:11:44,421
Bruno!

1060
01:11:49,384 --> 01:11:51,752
Bruno was not just the fastest,

1061
01:11:51,817 --> 01:11:55,331
he was the only finger on the button.

1062
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:56,963
Feeling a draft?

1063
01:11:57,034 --> 01:12:00,034
- It's chilly in here.
- Hot chili, or cold?

1064
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:02,016
Let's go.

1065
01:12:05,226 --> 01:12:06,820
Steady!

1066
01:12:06,891 --> 01:12:08,931
Steady, Bruno.

1067
01:12:14,732 --> 01:12:16,805
You live near Paris.

1068
01:12:16,877 --> 01:12:20,259
You drive a taxi.
Who's with you here tonight?

1069
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:22,853
M-m-my...

1070
01:12:22,925 --> 01:12:25,031
Your m-m-my? No?

1071
01:12:28,013 --> 01:12:30,566
- My dad and mom.
- Your parents, right.

1072
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:33,955
You're nervous being on TV.
Take it easy!

1073
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:36,136
It's seeing you for real...

1074
01:12:36,976 --> 01:12:41,482
When I was a kid, I came home for lunch
to watch you in Tic-Tac-Toe.

1075
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:42,696
That dates us!

1076
01:12:42,767 --> 01:12:46,151
You know the game has three milestones...

1077
01:12:55,345 --> 01:12:58,215
If you win a lot, which I hope you do,

1078
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,680
how will you spend it?

1079
01:13:00,755 --> 01:13:04,814
The usual dream? A beautiful house,
a world cruise?

1080
01:13:04,883 --> 01:13:06,377
- Both.
- Both.

1081
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:08,492
A house on a desert island.

1082
01:13:08,564 --> 01:13:11,411
- You have no ties here?
- No.

1083
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:13,745
You're not married, then?

1084
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:15,438
No... Yes, I think.

1085
01:13:15,508 --> 01:13:18,094
How's that?

1086
01:13:18,165 --> 01:13:20,882
I am. It's my final answer.

1087
01:13:21,493 --> 01:13:24,363
Here we have a very sociable contestant.

1088
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:29,137
For 200 euros.

1089
01:13:29,207 --> 01:13:33,167
A person who leaves in a hurry is said to

1090
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:35,149
A, take a bow,

1091
01:13:35,223 --> 01:13:36,881
B, take a hint,

1092
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:38,894
C, take a dive,

1093
01:13:38,968 --> 01:13:40,310
D, or take a powder?

1094
01:13:40,376 --> 01:13:42,132
Take a powder.

1095
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,549
Powder is right!
Congratulations.

1096
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:54,035
- Bruno?
- I have a hunch, but...

1097
01:13:54,106 --> 01:13:57,041
- First thought best thought.
- But fools rush in.

1098
01:13:57,114 --> 01:13:59,253
Yes.

1099
01:13:59,322 --> 01:14:01,527
Use a lifeline? You have three.

1100
01:14:01,595 --> 01:14:02,804
No! Yes...

1101
01:14:02,874 --> 01:14:06,104
Sorry, is that yes or no?

1102
01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:07,416
No...

1103
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:10,419
I'll go for C. "The Citroen Song."

1104
01:14:10,844 --> 01:14:15,186
It's my final... You should do a question
on famous last words.

1105
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:18,292
- Sorry, what?
- For example,

1106
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:21,181
Elvis Presley's last words were:

1107
01:14:21,247 --> 01:14:23,285
"I'm gonna read on the john."

1108
01:14:23,357 --> 01:14:25,048
It's true!

1109
01:14:25,117 --> 01:14:27,257
It's worth a thought, Bruno. Thanks.

1110
01:14:27,326 --> 01:14:29,269
Thanks a lot.

1111
01:14:29,342 --> 01:14:30,968
The correct answer

1112
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,185
is

1113
01:14:32,256 --> 01:14:33,369
answer

1114
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,122
C, for Citroen!

1115
01:14:38,176 --> 01:14:40,086
Well done.

1116
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:48,182
I think it's A. The diplodocus.

1117
01:14:48,257 --> 01:14:51,105
Of course it is. Right answer!

1118
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:52,631
I know it's Scooby-Doo.

1119
01:14:52,706 --> 01:14:55,575
And you're right.
Scooby-Doo is correct.

1120
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:57,953
My guess is B,

1121
01:14:58,019 --> 01:15:00,409
Chicken Victoria.

1122
01:15:00,482 --> 01:15:02,010
It's your final answer?

1123
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:05,880
Chicken Final is my answer, Victoria.

1124
01:15:05,955 --> 01:15:08,225
Sorry.

1125
01:15:08,292 --> 01:15:13,083
Bruno, if your answer is right,
you have won -

1126
01:15:13,157 --> 01:15:14,585
come what may -

1127
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,766
48,000 euros.

1128
01:15:18,277 --> 01:15:20,863
The right answer

1129
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,341
is

1130
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:27,426
Chicken Victoria!

1131
01:15:27,494 --> 01:15:29,218
48,000 euros!

1132
01:15:29,286 --> 01:15:34,373
Bruno, this is a unique moment
in the history of the game.

1133
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,287
We've reached - you've reached -

1134
01:15:37,351 --> 01:15:40,483
the top of the pyramid
to face the final question

1135
01:15:40,552 --> 01:15:42,375
for one million euros

1136
01:15:42,441 --> 01:15:45,921
without using
even one of your lifelines!

1137
01:15:47,337 --> 01:15:50,916
Ready? This question is worth
one million euros.

1138
01:15:51,977 --> 01:15:54,629
Which painter did not take part

1139
01:15:54,698 --> 01:15:59,106
in the first exhibition
of Impressionists in 1874?

1140
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:02,058
Cézanne?

1141
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:04,033
Renoir?

1142
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:06,725
Manet? Monet?

1143
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,584
Fuck!

1144
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:11,019
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

1145
01:16:11,085 --> 01:16:14,402
- It's a tough question.
- Worth a million euros!

1146
01:16:14,478 --> 01:16:18,186
You're a brilliant contestant,
but if you're in doubt...

1147
01:16:18,253 --> 01:16:20,839
- I'm not.
- I'm impressed. No pun intended.

1148
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,846
- I've no idea. I quit.
- No, no, no.

1149
01:16:23,919 --> 01:16:27,148
You're allowed to use a lifeline.

1150
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:31,241
- I know, but I'd rather...
- Quit with three unused lifelines?

1151
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:34,346
No, that would be idiotic.

1152
01:16:34,416 --> 01:16:37,383
I'll use the 50:50.

1153
01:16:37,456 --> 01:16:43,239
Good! That's sensible. Computer,
please remove two wrong answers.

1154
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:47,755
You're left with Manet and Monet.

1155
01:16:48,977 --> 01:16:51,117
That clears the air.
Manet or Monet?

1156
01:16:51,186 --> 01:16:53,128
It does?

1157
01:16:53,202 --> 01:16:55,658
- I'll Ask the Audience.
- OK.

1158
01:16:55,731 --> 01:16:57,835
Audience, get ready to vote,

1159
01:16:57,906 --> 01:17:00,907
but only if you know the answer.

1160
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:03,598
Ready, go!

1161
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:13,291
Oh, dear.

1162
01:17:13,364 --> 01:17:16,464
52:48. Just as I feared.

1163
01:17:16,534 --> 01:17:18,868
The audience is deeply split.

1164
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:22,575
Let me recap.

1165
01:17:22,646 --> 01:17:25,516
Either you quit now
and keep 300,000 euros,

1166
01:17:25,591 --> 01:17:27,479
a very tidy sum,

1167
01:17:27,543 --> 01:17:33,327
or you pick an answer
and run the risk of falling back to 48,000.

1168
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:38,770
But you still have one more lifeline.

1169
01:17:40,216 --> 01:17:42,639
- Phone.
- Phone a Friend, of course.

1170
01:17:42,713 --> 01:17:44,853
Phone a Friend!

1171
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:47,577
- I'd better quit.
- Wait!

1172
01:17:47,641 --> 01:17:50,641
Please sit down. Why quit now?

1173
01:17:50,713 --> 01:17:52,721
- I've won a lot.
- I know!

1174
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:56,111
More than I could ever earn in a taxi.

1175
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:02,071
You must have a friend
who can help you.

1176
01:18:10,076 --> 01:18:13,012
Nobody can help.
I have no friends.

1177
01:18:18,462 --> 01:18:20,698
Your Bruno is gold dust!

1178
01:18:20,766 --> 01:18:24,215
The ratings are sky high.
He's touched people's hearts.

1179
01:18:24,287 --> 01:18:26,075
Well, Bruno?

1180
01:18:29,152 --> 01:18:32,414
I'll phone a friend.

1181
01:18:33,888 --> 01:18:36,256
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1182
01:18:36,321 --> 01:18:39,550
You look a little bit upset.

1183
01:18:39,617 --> 01:18:41,526
Not because of the game.

1184
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,740
Who do we phone?

1185
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:46,430
François.

1186
01:18:46,498 --> 01:18:48,091
Right. Phone your friend.

1187
01:18:48,163 --> 01:18:51,065
He's no friend,
but he may know the answer.

1188
01:18:51,139 --> 01:18:53,211
Listen. Don't worry.

1189
01:19:15,942 --> 01:19:18,812
- Yes?
- Hello, this is Jean-Pierre Foucault.

1190
01:19:19,558 --> 01:19:22,144
- Who?
- He's pulling your leg.

1191
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:24,103
I'm here with Bruno.

1192
01:19:24,167 --> 01:19:27,910
- I guess you're watching Millionaire.
- No.

1193
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:33,410
Even so, we need you
for the million-euro question.

1194
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,164
Here's your friend Bruno.

1195
01:19:36,232 --> 01:19:38,305
Yes, here's Bruno.

1196
01:19:40,106 --> 01:19:42,211
Hello, François.

1197
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:48,003
- I didn't think you'd call.
- Me neither.

1198
01:19:48,426 --> 01:19:51,526
You weren't top
of my list of friends.

1199
01:19:51,595 --> 01:19:55,076
I guess not.
Still, I'm glad we can talk.

1200
01:19:55,148 --> 01:19:56,740
It's not about that.

1201
01:19:56,811 --> 01:20:01,319
I have a question on art.
I hope you can answer it.

1202
01:20:01,388 --> 01:20:03,624
Are you listening?

1203
01:20:06,413 --> 01:20:08,202
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

1204
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:11,946
I'd like to thank you
for helping my daughter.

1205
01:20:12,014 --> 01:20:15,461
- Not at all.
- Although I should have done it.

1206
01:20:15,534 --> 01:20:19,659
Right.
You were too busy with your bet.

1207
01:20:19,728 --> 01:20:23,436
If criticism's all I get,
I may as well hang up.

1208
01:20:23,503 --> 01:20:25,030
Be my guest.

1209
01:20:25,103 --> 01:20:29,327
- Do we hit the clock?
- No! Let it run. I'm the boss!

1210
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:32,492
You're angry, sure.
I stabbed you in the back.

1211
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:35,179
But I didn't know
your other friend did too.

1212
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:38,031
- Don't give me "friend."
- Just let me say...

1213
01:20:38,097 --> 01:20:39,559
Be quiet.

1214
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:42,449
You are - you were - my only friend.

1215
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:45,703
Don't make me cry.

1216
01:20:45,778 --> 01:20:49,324
In The Little Prince,
the fox says:

1217
01:20:49,394 --> 01:20:51,500
"If you tame me, we'll need each other."

1218
01:20:51,571 --> 01:20:56,525
You'll be unique for me.
And I'll be unique for you."

1219
01:20:57,492 --> 01:20:59,598
How did you know that?

1220
01:21:06,933 --> 01:21:09,454
Tell me you're not too angry.

1221
01:21:10,486 --> 01:21:12,723
I need to hear you say it.

1222
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:16,491
I'm not too angry with you.

1223
01:21:16,566 --> 01:21:18,956
I was at the time, but...

1224
01:21:21,272 --> 01:21:25,876
Sorry to barge in
on your privacy, Bruno,

1225
01:21:25,943 --> 01:21:28,594
but maybe we should
get back to the question?

1226
01:21:28,663 --> 01:21:31,086
Of course.

1227
01:21:31,161 --> 01:21:33,496
François, here's the question.

1228
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:35,862
Which one of these two painters

1229
01:21:35,929 --> 01:21:42,226
did not take part
in the Impressionist exhibition of 1874?

1230
01:21:42,298 --> 01:21:44,950
Manet or Monet?

1231
01:21:45,019 --> 01:21:47,834
- You understand the question?
- Yes.

1232
01:21:48,827 --> 01:21:50,420
So?

1233
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:52,629
It was Manet.

1234
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,482
- Not a shadow of a doubt?
- Not a shadow.

1235
01:21:56,219 --> 01:21:58,195
OK. Bye.

1236
01:21:59,229 --> 01:22:00,985
Bye.

1237
01:22:01,052 --> 01:22:03,955
Hold it.
You might want to thank him.

1238
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,582
Hello, François?

1239
01:22:06,653 --> 01:22:08,858
I... Hello?

1240
01:22:12,286 --> 01:22:14,523
So?

1241
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,907
I'll go for

1242
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:22,205
answer C. Manet.

1243
01:22:23,391 --> 01:22:25,629
It's my final answer.

1244
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:31,674
If it's wrong, Bruno,
you've lost 952,000 euros

1245
01:22:31,744 --> 01:22:33,370
and won only 48,000.

1246
01:22:33,441 --> 01:22:36,344
But if you're right,

1247
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:40,412
you've won a million euros.

1248
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:47,225
The answer, for a million euros, is

1249
01:22:48,835 --> 01:22:52,032
Manet! You were right!
One million euros!

1250
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:12,253
A million euros! Well done.

1251
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:41,251
ONE YEAR LATER

1252
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:45,088
Thank you, friends.

1253
01:23:45,163 --> 01:23:48,872
- Happy birthday.
- Isn't that...

1254
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:51,397
Thank you.

1255
01:23:51,467 --> 01:23:53,769
- It's a beauty!
- Blow!

1256
01:23:53,837 --> 01:23:55,942
Magnificent.

1257
01:23:59,277 --> 01:24:01,764
Happy birthday, François.

1258
01:24:02,349 --> 01:24:05,066
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1259
01:24:05,134 --> 01:24:07,207
Excuse me.

1260
01:24:08,302 --> 01:24:10,855
Could I have the bill, please?

1261
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:13,893
It's already been paid
by that gentleman.

1262
01:24:37,299 --> 01:24:39,371
Happy birthday, François.

1263
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:43,535
Thank you.

1264
01:24:47,604 --> 01:24:49,580
What are you doing here?

1265
01:24:49,653 --> 01:24:52,073
It's as good as anywhere.

1266
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:57,429
Even your slice of heaven?

1267
01:24:58,229 --> 01:25:00,018
It was a slice of hell.

1268
01:25:01,909 --> 01:25:04,276
And your million?

1269
01:25:04,726 --> 01:25:08,785
It goes fast,
especially if you're not in the habit.

1270
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:13,653
So, you're back driving a taxi?

1271
01:25:14,903 --> 01:25:16,660
It's what I do best.

1272
01:25:22,552 --> 01:25:24,887
I brought you a gift.

1273
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,344
- Should I open it?
- Sure.

1274
01:25:35,674 --> 01:25:37,911
- Like it?
- Yes.

1275
01:25:42,939 --> 01:25:45,623
- Who's that?
- Dad's best friend.

1276
01:25:52,796 --> 01:25:56,145
I thought we had to watch
our braking distance.

1277
01:26:05,886 --> 01:26:08,537
I see your daughter is back.

1278
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:14,523
As if you didn't know.

1279
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,073
I had no idea.

1280
01:26:19,232 --> 01:26:23,061
So, you came here tonight
by chance?

1281
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:26,203
Absolutely by chance, yes.

1282
01:26:29,122 --> 01:26:30,432
- Why?
- No reason.

1283
01:26:30,498 --> 01:26:33,847
It's a happy coincidence, that's all.

1284
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:41,181
- Want to hear the best bit?
- Go on.

1285
01:26:41,252 --> 01:26:44,001
- Remember your vase?
- That you demolished.

1286
01:26:44,067 --> 01:26:45,312
Yeah.

1287
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:48,893
You said it was unique, right?

1288
01:26:48,964 --> 01:26:52,281
Well, we had drinks
with the producer after the show,

1289
01:26:52,357 --> 01:26:54,080
and there was your vase.

1290
01:26:54,148 --> 01:26:57,116
- My vase?
- No, but one exactly like it.

1291
01:26:57,189 --> 01:26:58,913
Are you sure?

1292
01:26:58,982 --> 01:27:01,316
I looked. It was the spitting image.

1293
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:05,506
- Do those vases come in pairs?
- Not normally, no.

1294
01:27:05,574 --> 01:27:10,529
See? Maybe you paid a fortune for a fake.

1295
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,803
Don't you believe me?

1296
01:27:12,871 --> 01:27:15,839
You don't? How much do you bet?

1297
01:27:15,912 --> 01:27:18,946
- No more bets!
- Just a friendly bet?

1298
01:27:19,016 --> 01:27:21,253
OK, a friendly bet!
