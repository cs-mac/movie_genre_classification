00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,150
- Bullshit! You mean you just saved your ass.
- You will compromise the chances of rescue.

303
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,930
- No, you want to save it.
- Did not you you do something you do Thi missing.

304
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,240
- Everyone should know ...
- Do your best to help.

305
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,280
Time passes, Paul.

306
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,000
That's why you need to contact him
Dan Brenner emergency.

307
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,500
Well.

308
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360

- Yes, yes, I'm Paul.

311
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,660
Paul, I was informed of your situation.

312
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,820
I want to know that we have already started working
and try to get out of there.

313
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,180
Oh, thank you, Lord!

314
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,800
I was told that the deadline
s 21:00. Is it true?

315
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,220
- The so called me.
- All right.

316
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,200
You do not have much time to them.
And I want to make sure I understand.

317
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,120
- Kidnappers have you buried in the ground?
- Yes, an old drum ciug.

you signal on your phone

319
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,710
N is not greater depth
half a meter.

320
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,720
- I do not know. Maybe.
- How is your phone battery?

321
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,400
- How you gonna keep it?
- It downloaded more than half.

322
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,080
All Rights Reserved. Gotta eat
little battery.

323
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,920
The best way to find you,
We follow to tell you the phone signal.

324
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,100
- The buzzer is activated or shakes?
- On the shakes.

325
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,680
Hold down the star key
to modify his door.

326
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,500
- You use less energy.
- And with my Zippo lighter what?

327
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,320
- You and a lighter?
- Yes.

328
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,520
- Use whatever you search for clues to ...
- Wait. I do not consume oxygen?

329
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,500
- Do not worry, yet. Try ...
- It is very dark in here, no telephone.

330
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,810
Paul, to understand.
Try your index is

331
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,120
one could say
when the drum was made ciugul.

332
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,680
- Guys, you must grãbiþi.
- We are working as quickly as possible, Paul.

333
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,224
You know if you are somehow
, And other survivors?

334
00:32:59,225 --> 00:33:01,325
- From your convoy?
- Yes.

335
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,780
At the front, know nothing.

336
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,180
I wanted my family
were better, period.

337
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,490
I did not know if you come here and a.

338
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,040
I did not know what
none of us.

339
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,680
- He calls me e..
- Whoever has kidnapped?

340
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,430
- Yes. What to do?
- You know the phone number is?

341
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
- Yes.
- Give it to me and me.

342
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,340
- Do not reply?
- Give me the first issue.

343
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,500
- A cross-eyed.
- Y address.

344
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,500
- We closed.
- Y address. Now!

345
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:27,325
Hello! Hello!

346
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
Two hours and four minutes.

347
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,050
You must give me more time.

348
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,680
Have you talked to people at the embassy?
Pay?

349
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,390
Yes. I spoke with someone from the government and
They told me not to pay a penny.

350
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Do not pay?

351
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,550
No. They said they
not negotiate with terrorists.

352
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,150
- Terrorists? I am a terrorist?
- Yes. You are a terrorist, you bastard!

353
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,230
If you are afraid,
means I'm a terrorist?

354
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,280
What do you make me wrong Thiele?

355
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,820
- What does it hurt?
- Yes.

356
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,020
Yes, I ...

357
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,520
I came here to win
a little money, that's all.

358
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,450
And I had a job in Como
you are here. Now my family has nothing.

359
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,620
Not my fault!

360
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,360
N 9 / 11 is not my fault
but you still have no market here.

361
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,000
Neither Saddam was not my fault
but you're still here!

362
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,460
Thi-I said, I came here to work.
To help rebuild the country.

363
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,350
- To rebuild what you have destroyed.
- You stop it! Stop, please!

364
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,440
I am an ordinary man. A single disc, right?

365
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,120
I have no authority to make decisions.
I want to go home, nothing more.

366
00:34:25,907 --> 00:34:26,960
Hello!

367
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,550
You should make a video
for redemption.

368
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,810
Yes. Get me out of here
and make-Thi and video.

369
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,530
No. A registration to do now.

370
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,760
- What? How?
- Use the camera on the phone.

371
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,920
On your feet. Read your intrucþiunile
box at your feet.

372
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,960
- I see.
- On your feet.

373
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,700
Intrucþiunile box bed
what's on your feet.

374
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,390
Well. If you save,
let me go?

375
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Only if we receive money.

376
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,720
I will pay five million
dollars to me.

377
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,680
And getting less. One million dollars.

378
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,000
If you pay me to let go?

379
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,080
One million dollars.

380
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,920
Thank you that you called Conroy family.

381
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,130
Currently, we are at home.
Leave a message after the beep. Thank you.

382
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,470
Phooey!

383
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,319
- Paul?
- Ithier give his phone number ...

384
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,699
Wait a minute.
Okay, go ahead.

385
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,735
Well.
Wait a bit.

386
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:36,000
07902-24-921.

387
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,793
It's great, Paul!

388
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:42,029
If you do not use a telephone line cloned
'Ll find them in minutes.

389
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,909
And with me?
You can find my phone signal?

390
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,669
We have many problems with that.

391
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,043
It seems that the use of a line EDS, which
probably through a network of Egypt.

392
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:51,244
What do you mean?

393
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,793
It will not be easy.

394
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:56,129
- Wants to make a video.
- No!

395
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,299
- Keep the distance and as many as you can.
- If it'll save me, I do.

396
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,429
The last thing we want in November, is that
this disc to go to Al Jazeera.

397
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,469
- "We"?
- Yes.

398
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,329
This situation can not change
into an international incident.

399
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,789
You just know you care, you?
Since I do not care?

400
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,029
- We care.
- And me?

401
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,649
- We care, Paul. From this we ...
- No. You do not care.

402
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,509
Do not worry about me.
Nobody cares about you.

403
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,099
I had eight friends who were murdered,
and six of them were omorâþi today.

404
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,959
- Listen to ...
- I had no weapon, no armor, nothing.

405
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,559
Because you are not soldiers.

406
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,209
Let's say that those who
I was put in the coffin of that!

407
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,309
Paul, listens ...

408
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,399
Let's say that those who
killed my friends!

409
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,309
- We do all that kindness and you can.
- No, do nothing!

410
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,519
- OK. Calm yourself.
- I know how things work.

411
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,229
You do not worry about your projects
policy of secrecy and clandestine.

412
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,109
If I were a diplomat or a
commissioned in charge of hostage rescue

413
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,149
or any other function and important
I have brought you here to flash.

414
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,859
But I am a mere mortal, and therefore,
should shut up and die.

415
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,809
We must focus
what you do, Paul.

416
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,969
- Go-ta-n me, Dan!
- Paul, listen to me!

417
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,599
The number one priority
is to find you on.

418
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,829
And as I look for research
a four-star general.

419
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,699
It and so do not waste oxygen Thi
implying that crap.

420
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,430
I can not ...

421
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,899
- I hear you, Paul? Do you agree?
- Do not ...

422
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,738
S-Who knew that I was put here?
Who are they?

423
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:07,239
Ordinary people.
Like you and me.

424
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,959
- I am not a terrorist.
- No, they are not terrorists.

425
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,360
How do you know?

426
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,799
If you were a homeless man, mortal hunger.
In fact, I take that back.

427
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,849
If your family would have starved,
what you have done for them?

428
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,209
- And I've never had someone killed.
- You sure?

429
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,925
Who cares?

430
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:29,009
Are you sure that criminals do not care about anything.
Do you worry that receive money and.

431
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,779
Then you pay them. Give them your money.

432
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,404
Believe me, if it were the solution,
and not have hesitated a moment.

433
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,439
How many people have spent on this?

434
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,899
- Since when am I here?
- Yes.

435
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,159
Hundreds. Journalists, manufacturers, soldiers ...
Hundreds of people were rãpiþi.

436
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,249
This is one of
more profitable business here.

437
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,550
How many people you saved?

438
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,499
- How many people you saved?
- Not much.

439
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,200
- Tell me their names.
- Whose name?

440
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,499
- Tell me a name.
- Whose name?

441
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,719
Show me thi really cared for them.
Rine that meant something.

442
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,379
Mark White.

443
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,420
Who was Mark White?

444
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:17,219
Unless you're in New Hampshire.
He was 26 years and was a medical student.

445
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,099
He came to help doctors here.

446
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,250
What happened to him?

447
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,094
They captured some insurgents.

448
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:27,960
- When?
- In three weeks.

449
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,230
Do not forget the name.

450
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:36,452
Remembers their names.

451
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,158
And a. ..?

452
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,630
- E. ..?

01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,750
Good. This means that
Because we are in the right place.

608
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,000
Are you anywhere near?

609
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:14,225
I talked to soldiers
Ithier accompanying the convoy.

610
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:16,336
I'm alive?

611
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,390
A part of them.

612
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:20,900
The two Bradley tanks
were hit by bombs trap.

613
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,400
The rest have fallen into the trap
firearms of small caliber.

614
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,113
But what happened there, Paul?

615
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:28,765
Paul.

616
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:31,935
Paul?

617
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:54,416
No!

618
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:17,064
Phooey!

619
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:36,910
Come on! Come on!

620
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,530
Hello?
Hello. Who's there?

621
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,790
- Paul Conroy?
- Yes, I'm Paul. Who are you?

622
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:50,480
Paul, my name is Alan Davenport

623
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:53,090
Director of Personnel are here
Christian, Roland and Thomas.

624
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:54,370
Thi-I left a message.

625
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,840
Yes, but I learned from Rebecca Browning
who works at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

626
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,394
Can you tell me tell you a bit
on the state where you are?

627
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:03,314
It worsened and Facebook.
There was an explosion or something like,

628
01:07:03,315 --> 01:07:05,300
and sand flowing everywhere.
I have about half an hour before ...

629
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:08,800
It does not matter. Lini and you and you up.
You should try to calm down.

630
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,400
Tell me, Paul.
Who are you talking about?

631
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:14,610
The people who kidnapped me and Dan Brenner
Working Group of the hostages ...

632
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,400
Okay, Paul. I'm with you.
What I can say about the media?

633
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,810
I know that your redemption request
was released,

634
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,150
but you talked with someone
what happens?

635
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,020
- No.
- Good. It would be better to stay and a.

636
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,370
It is important to maintain this
quiet as possible.

637
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,530
This situation is out of control!

638
01:07:30,544 --> 01:07:34,220
Help me! Help me! Please!
How can you help me?

639
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,240
I know you're upset, but from what I heard

640
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,630
have already taken the necessary
that for you out there.

641
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,140
Thus, A and, hopefully, will not last very long.

642
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,410
- Praise the Lord!
- Yes, thank you God!

643
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,960
I want to register call,
to start a tape recorder.

644
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,380
A second ...

645
01:07:54,820 --> 01:08:00,420
My name is Alan Davenport, Director
The staff of the Christian, Roland and Thomas.

646
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:03,020
Today's date is October 23, 2006.

647
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,130
Talk to Paul Conroy.

648
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:09,920
Mr. Conroy, you are aware
that this conversation is being recorded?

649
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:11,883
- What?
- Please answer my question.

650
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:13,680
Shit!

651
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,918
- Mr President, Conroy!
- Yes. Yes!

652
01:08:14,919 --> 01:08:17,617
Let me do this?

653
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:19,600
For what you have my permission?
What's this?

654
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,700
- I want my answer, yes or no? Please!
- Yes. Are you thanking?

655
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,522
Thank you.
Mr. Conroy, when you committed to the CRT?

656
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:29,800
I do not know. In nine months ago.
In January. What does this mean?

657
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:33,620
I as well as the official date of your employment,
January 4, 2005. Is that correct?

658
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:36,000
With his worries? This is crazy!

659
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,920
- January 4, 2005. Is that correct?
- Yes.

660
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,190
During the initial briefing,
both before being sent to Iraq,

661
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:46,070
You have been warned of the dangers
it is the job?

662
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:47,910
You mean when
when I arrived in Dallas,

663
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,280
We said that all trucks will be
armored glass and antiglonþ?

664
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,080
You say if you told us everything
things, the situation is different here?

665
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:55,670
That's why I told you?

666
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,610
I need your answer
yes or no? Please!

667
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,070
Yes.

668
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,780
Right now you have received and signed
an employment contract with the CRT

669
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:08,920
and you explained that his company policy
and your duties?

670
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,240
- Yes, I signed a pile of papers.
- Yes or no?

671
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,100
Yes! I signed the contract. Yes.

672
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:18,940
Ne-nþeleg who were taken hostage in Iraq
two hours ago, is not it?

673
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:22,350
Yes! This is a correct assessment
my situation, you idiot.

674
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,829
Ask this discussion?

675
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:24,960
Our legal department,

676
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:27,780
requires us to obtain a statement
Sworn to our employees,

677
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:29,920
confirming
why

678
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,660
company forced to barter their services.

679
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:36,300
Since this morning,
your contract with the CRT has been officially closed.

680
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,700
Wait, wait, wait ...
What did you say?

681
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,960
We have been informed that you had a relationship
Working with colleagues of the CRT

682
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,710
Pamela Wrestling.

683
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:48,650
- No. Wait ...
- Was stated in your contract

684
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:51,780
a clause in the fraternity,
it was very clearly explained

685
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:53,340
-... that any relationship ...
- You stop, you stop!

686
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:55,640
whether romantic or sexual nature

687
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,550
is deemed insufficient
TRC officials

688
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,890
and result in immediate termination
contract.

689
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,900
We were just friends.

690
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:05,400
- Our records say otherwise.
- Your entries are false.

691
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:08,958
We have a legal obligation to inform you that
due to technical

692
01:10:08,959 --> 01:10:12,840
Erath CRT no employee
when your removal,

693
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:16,900

for any damage caused to you,

694
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:19,800
the date and time
the official conclusion.

695
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:22,980
Therefore, in your case,
this includes the current incident

696
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:26,290
or any other consequences
thereof.

697
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:31,140
And my insurance money?
My family needs money.

698
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:34,520
Since trãiaþi
termination when ...

699
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,176
Do not do that!

700
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:39,363
- You understand what I ...?
- There is something like!

701
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:43,221
You understood everything you said, Mr. Conroy?

702
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,810
Mr. Conroy!

703
01:10:49,499 --> 01:10:51,213
Fuck you, motherfucker!

704
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:58,346
Since I finished the interview
Paul Conroy, one to stop the recorder.

705
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:02,573
You put me here.

706
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:08,454
Sorry.

707
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,550
Reply!

708
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:04,850
Phooey!

709
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:22,922
Why do not you answer me?

710
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:55,200
Put me º...!

711
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:38,509
- Paul, are you?
- I am dead.

712
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,220
- How do you know?
- I know.

713
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:44,775
Three F-16 flew over the city
few minutes ago.

714
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:46,531
Yes, I know.

715
01:14:47,237 --> 01:14:49,550
It was very fun for me.

716
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:54,180
Did you know that I'm here?

717
01:14:55,204 --> 01:14:56,541
Yes.

718
01:14:57,956 --> 01:15:00,019
Do they care?

719
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,818
The people knew that I was kidnapped ...

720
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:09,550
If you're dead

721
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:11,990
I never know where they are.

722
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:15,326
We continue to say that we follow
phone signal.

723
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:20,050
- You've already tried that.
- We can try again.

724
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:30,842
- It's over, you?
- No.

725
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:35,972
Yes.

726
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:43,605
What should I do?

727
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:46,858
I do not know.

728
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:50,320
It's weird.

729
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,180
What?

730
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:55,017
You know ...

731
01:15:58,016 --> 01:16:00,788
He wanted this
to do otherwise, Paul.

732
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:03,996
Yes.

733
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,100
And I.

734
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,110
It does not matter.

735
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:24,000
It does not matter.

736
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:27,941
My name is Paul Steven Conroy.

737
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:36,032
Security Number: 048-32-1198,
Date of Birth 20/03/1976.

738
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:41,660
This is my last record
wish and serve as a testament.

739
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:49,280
My wife, Linda Conroy

740
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,174
I leave the $ 700
from my personal savings

741
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,950
and all I have left
the annuity.

742
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,000
My son, Shane Conroy ...

743
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,009
I have nothing to leave them.

744
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:13,136
I leave my clothes.

745
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,600
I leave my clothes.

746
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:18,992
For, when more and more.

747
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:21,327
But that did not leave.

748
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:31,158
I did ...
He wanted more ...

749
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:38,345
Maybe if I were a baseball player
famous, or a guy wearing a costume

750
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,222
then he took over.

751
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:44,392
But if you, yourself can be even
Form one of the guys knew.

752
01:17:48,418 --> 01:17:49,840
Yes.

753
01:17:49,845 --> 01:17:53,580
Promise me that when you grow up
nobody to take care of your mother.

754
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:56,000
And i. .. I do not know.

755
01:17:57,594 --> 01:18:00,491
And promise me that all the time
you try to do the right thing.

756
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:06,539
I love you very much, Shane.

757
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:11,085
Maybe I was sufficiently many times
I said. I do not know.

758
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:13,838
Or maybe yes, I have no idea.

759
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:17,800
But probably not enough.

760
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,976
Sorry, Linda.
You must listen.

761
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,830
You're not dead.
Hello? Hello!

762
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,100
Where are the prices?

763
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,720
- I do not know.
- But you know what?

764
