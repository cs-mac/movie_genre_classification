1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,050
This is German National Radio

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,370
And here I am.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,710
The Fuehrer is in our midst again.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,710
Speaking now: the Fuehrer.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,310
(Hitler samples)

6
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,170
(and then you get used to it)

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,740
(and you understand)

8
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,280
(it's not the end of the world)

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,220
(even if it looks gray sometimes)

10
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,000
(one day it will be full of colors again)

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,050
(one day it'll be blue as the sky again)

12
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,770
(if things go topsy-turvy)

13
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,080
(and our hair's going gray)

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,200
(it's not the end of the world)

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,280
(it's still needed it after all)

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,450
(it's not the end of the world)

17
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,650
(even if it looks gray sometimes)

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,350
(one day it will be full of colors again)

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,620
(one day it will be blue as the sky again)

20
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,170
(if things go topsy-turvy)

21
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,650
(and our hair's going gray)

22
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,250
(it's not the end of the world)

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,280
(it's still needed after all)

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,420
(it's not the end of the world)

25
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:23,540
(it is still needed after all)

26
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,820
He won't burn.

27
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,820
Reporting as ordered. He won't burn, Sir.

28
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,110
Who won't burn?

29
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,510
The Fuehrer, Mr. Obersturmbannfuehrer.

30
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,540
And Mrs. Fuehrer, Mrs. Braun, not either, Sir.

31
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,650
Pour some gas on 'em and they'll burn.

32
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,880
Gas? On the Fuehrer?

33
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Mr. Obersturmbannfuehrer, Sir.

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
There's no more Fuehrer.

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,400
And don't call me that you ignoramus.

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Yes, Mr. Obersturmbannfuehrer, Sir.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,880
My god.

38
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,800
The ashes of the world's greatest
commander had barely cooled

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,050
when a large demand for memorabilia
from our 'Millennial Reich' arose.

40
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,620
I was 9 at the time and
had only just begun trading antiques.

41
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,620
But I already specialized.

42
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,680
The Fuehrer's personal items
achieved the highest prices.

43
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,450
The more personal, the better.

44
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,450
Preferably close to the skin.

45
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,200
We had lots of foreign guests at the time.

46
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,220
The Fuehrer was especially popular
with our American friends.

47
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,970
These were skeptical by nature
and only bought authentic goods.

48
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,970
Preferably certified.

49
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,800
This is my Sunday hat. Signed, A.Hitler.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,970
I looked back at my debut product
with a certain professional pride.

51
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,170
I was determined not to put my rise
to an artistic all-rounder at risk.

52
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,170
Especially not by real work...

53
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,170
.. in the bourgeois sense of the word.

54
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:46,170
In the Fifties most Germans were busy
producing the 'economic miracle'.

55
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,540
And did not want to be reminded
of their most recent past.

56
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,680
Not only that Nazis couldn't be found anywhere

57
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,000
there never had been any. Not even sympathizers.

58
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,310
Business was bad.

59
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,340
That's why I knew right away
when I looked into Bigi's eyes

60
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,310
that I had found the love of my life.

61
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,620
I introduced myself to my future wife
as Professor Dr. Fritz Knobel.

62
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,370
Produced the necessary documents
and together with her left the hectic city.

63
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,880
Biggi opened a small cleaning business

64
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,340
and I fully dedicated myself
to my artistic inclinations.

65
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,170
[years later in Swabia]

66
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,850
Don't make such a fuss.
Take your clothes off.

67
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,220
I won't.

68
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,740
Biggi, dear, you've got such a great body.

69
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,310
Flowing hips, an elegant nuchal line,

70
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,450
hot breasts.

71
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,880
Breasts, breasts, forget it.

72
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,310
Just like with that French brothel picture.
And what did I look like?

73
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,910
Like an old, drunk whore!

74
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,910
So?
Here, look. No!

75
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,570
Sorry dear, I can't help the
way Toulouse-Lautrec painted.

76
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,740
I can't change his style
only so that you look better!

77
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,540
It's different with Hitler,
he was a much worse painter.

78
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,510
What?

79
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,510
I mean better, much better!

80
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,310
He made people look better than in reality,

81
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,970
healthy, natural, beautiful.
Especially the women.

82
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:39,370
Please, darling, undress and I'll paint you
as Eva Braun. More beautiful than ever.

83
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,050
I won't pose nude for
somebody who fucked Hitler.

84
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,680
He didn't. He couldn't!

85
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,600
It's a historic fact that sexually he
wasn't really...  Darling!

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,050
Darling, don't make such a fuss.

87
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,650
Find someone else.

88
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,110
But who? Biggi. Darling.

89
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,200
Only once. The deadline's tomorrow.

90
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,940
It's a fixed job. Thousands of Deutschmarks.

91
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,050
My marriage had been in crisis for a while.

92
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,480
My business failures where mostly to blame.

93
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,220
Predominantly in the area of French
impressionism, surrealism, and dadaism.

94
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,170
But this time I had a legitimate assignment.

95
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,800
My customer was a passionate collector
of .. ehm .. nazi realism.

96
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,910
I was ordered to get him an authentic
nude of Eva Braun, painted by Hitler.

97
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,250
Not a problem for me.

98
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,940
I knew the Fuehrer's companion's face.

99
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,400
I only needed to find a matching body.

100
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,680
Knobel, Prof. Dr. Fritz Knobel.

101
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,250
I am the official painter of the
prime minister of Baden-Württemberg.

102
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,370
I've been commissioned by the
government to paint oil portraits

103
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,880
the most beautiful women
of our Swabian home country.

104
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
I'm not from Swabia.

105
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,110
I am from Bergisches Land.

106
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,540
You are so beautiful.
And I will depict you as silent.

107
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,200
I see.

108
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,200
Had I only left my hands off brush and woman.

109
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,770
I would have avoided a lot of trouble.

110
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,680
At the same time in Hamburg the "Carin II",

111
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,480
a rotten old boat was dry-docked.

112
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,800
An equally seedy Journalist named Hermann Willié

113
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,480
had just bought it under great financial strain
from Hermann Göring's estate.

114
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,110
Willié was a muckraker
with a phenomenal talent for marketing.

115
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,820
He would make my modest artistic talents
bloom in a catastrophic way.

116
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,370
Hermann, getting that thing out now?
That'll cost another fortune.

117
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,370
Wasn't it OK there in the water?

118
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,370
No, not OK, we sunk.

119
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,480
Some good advice if I may:
Sell it, before you're completely ruined.

120
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,910
Can you spare a hundred?
I promised the guys Champagne.

121
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,880
Dear highly esteemed Madam, ...

122
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,140
..high madam... highly honored madam...

123
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm at the end of my rope, financially.

124
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,970
No,no.

125
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,110
I am the proud owner of your uncle's yacht.

126
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,650
I am ecstatic to be meeting our honored
Marshal of the Reich's niece in person.

127
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,910
Sitting, uh, standing in front of her.

128
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,420
I am guessing you are...

129
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,420
...flat broke. I mean ...eh

130
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,910
..flat out amazed at how young and beautiful...

131
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
..how young, a highly esteemed
madam is standing in front of me.

132
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,480
Sorry, I am flabbergasted to be looking
into the esteemed Marshal' nieces eyes.

133
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,200
I am beside myself.

134
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Von Hepp.

135
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Willié, Hermann.

136
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,770
Willié with acute accent.

137
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,570
I took the liberty of getting these
flowers as a token of ....

138
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
I love spring flowers.

139
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,340
Even though I have to say ...

140
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,340
..for me, autumn also has  its nice, warm days.

141
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,250
What?

142
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,250
You know, I am the emotional type.

143
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,250
I did not fail to notice that.

144
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,250
A very unusual move by a reporter..

145
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,940
especially since he's from such a ...
neodemocratic newspaper.

146
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,340
You have to believe me, ...

147
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,140
my paper's direction isn't always....

148
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,370
..else I wouldn't have
taken the burden of your uncle's yacht.

149
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,140
That's what I though. Otherwise
I would not have met with you.

150
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,110
I thought a man who buys and
maintains my uncle's boat

151
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,450
can hardly be one of them.

152
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,050
An when I saw the picture of
the yacht you send me...

153
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,400
...with you are at the helm,
all strong and naked ...

154
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Well, I wasn't all naked.
I was wearing pants.

155
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:13,770
Shorts! And I thought to myself,
Freya, let's take a closer look at that one.

156
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,770
I would not mind at all,
quite the opposite.

157
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,770
How dare you!

158
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,970
My imagination runs wild when
I look into your eyes Mrs. Reichsmarschall.

159
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,570
About if we shouldn't  transfer that thing
back into your lap, for example.

160
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,140
What thing, please?

161
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,620
I mean the ship. It should return
into the bosom of your family.

162
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,570
I'll cut you a deal. 350k in cash.

163
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,450
If you need a bill, you'll have to add sales tax.

164
00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:01,020
It seems like you're quite the ... sleazy person.

165
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,250
Just a little...  - Professor!

166
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,910
Like this?

167
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,910
Yes like that.

168
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,450
Do you want to try it on?

169
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,050
It's my uncle's bathrobe. The Reichsmarschall.

170
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,250
The Reichsmarschall. With pleasure.

171
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,970
Over...  or under my clothes?

172
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,970
As you wish.

173
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,110
Well, in that case, I'll allow myself to ...

174
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,620
You look manly.
Masculine and powerful.

175
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,940
I love you, Freya, ... like crazy.

176
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,910
Big Hermann's yacht with his niece
on the Elbe river at sundown.

177
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,280
How fucking cool!

178
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,910
There is no yacht more German than
that of the Reichsmarschall.

179
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,310
This needs to be on the title....

180
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,250
Hermann, maybe you should
let the editorship know who the owner is.

181
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,570
Pit, what's that for?

182
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,510
It doesn't matter who owns it now,
it's important that it used to belong to Göring.

183
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,540
And the current owner will
let us take all the pictures we want.

184
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
The ship, the niece, everything for 50k.

185
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,620
I've brought a few samples.

186
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,880
Here, the Reichsmarschall's bath robe.

187
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,710
From the family estate.

188
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,000
12 silver teaspoons...

189
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
..monogrammed, from the same estate.

190
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,250
Swastika..

191
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,140
..and Hallmark.

192
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,510
Used very heavily by the Reichsmarschall.

193
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,450
We can have all of this, everything.

194
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,600
Everything's included in those 50 grand.

195
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,420
40?

196
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,400
Very interesting. Dead for
40 years, yet still sweaty.

197
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,710
Smell this, Uwe.

198
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,220
Say, Willié, is it possible that you
are the proud owner of Göring's yacht?

199
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,420
You can't call that ownership.

200
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,400
Technically, yes, maybe, ....

201
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,370
.. but actually the bank owns it.

202
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,480
I think that's quite the chutzpah, Mr. Willié.

203
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,620
So, that's what you think.

204
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,170
I think it's pretty amateurish of you
not to realize what a big hit this is.

205
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,880
.. journalistically.

206
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,280
As long as I am sitting here...

207
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,250
It's "we", Uwe.

208
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,880
Of course it is! As long as we are sitting here...

209
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,800
...we won't have a swastika on the title,
no Göring boat...

210
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:02,850
..no sweaty bathrobes, and no
teaspoons with swastikas and hallmarks.
...we won't have a swastika on the title,
no Göring boat...

211
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,200
..no sweaty bathrobes, and no
teaspoons with swastikas and hallmarks.

212
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
That's right, Uwe.

213
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,420
Then soon there won't be any readers left.

214
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,880
I'm sick of your Nazi shit. Nobody wants to
know. Nobody, never ever!

215
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,480
Eva Braun.

216
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,250
Naked in oil.

217
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,940
Created by the Fuehrer himself...

218
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,710
..with his own brush.

219
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,880
Doctor Knobel, ...I can't call you doctor anymore.

220
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,880
Fritz!

221
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Oh, gee.

222
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Let's drink to that.

223
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,510
To devoted comradeship.

224
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,050
I am Karl.

225
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,370
Karl, cheers!

226
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,620
Cheers, Fritzle!

227
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,650
Right this way...

228
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,650
What?

229
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,080
Ah, about those old machines.

230
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,770
..ah, him, I used to know him
until 1938, then we lost touch.

231
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,000
This is Prof. Dr. Staffek, 
an expert on the Third Reich.

232
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,600
Delighted.

233
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,080
Prof. Dr. Knobel, also a known art historian.

234
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,910
Former president of the art academy Leipzig.

235
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,910
Dresden, actually!

236
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,600
I see, so there's two experts now.

237
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,850
I wasn't informed that this was
going to be a scholastic competition.

238
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,850
Neither was I.

239
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,540
But I will gladly accept any challenger.

240
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,770
Oh Fritzle, don't get me wrong.

241
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,420
But mother said...

242
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,800
You did too.

243
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,510
Yes, me, too.

244
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,850
We thought 10000 DM
is a lot of money for a painting.

245
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,970
Just show us if you
don't have anything to hide.

246
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,310
I've got nothing to hide.

247
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,080
I just want to say even experts
can be wrong sometimes.

248
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,140
Ah, yes, I'll leave that to you, dear fellow.

249
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:44,620
It's, it's, unbelievable....

250
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,620
That's Eva!

251
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,510
Little Eva in the field behind
the house in front of the Watzmann.

252
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,450
I've never said otherwise.

253
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,480
You can give your opinion later,
when it is your turn.

254
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,850
First of all I can tell you
that this is definitely an unknown piece.

255
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:08,220
I never said anything else. This
is an unknown painting by the Fuehrer...

256
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,200
Unknown to you maybe,
but not to me.

257
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,680
Not to you?

258
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,680
No, I was present when he painted it.

259
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,510
You were ... present?

260
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,650
Yes.

261
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,200
I was a summer guest at the Berghof.

262
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,510
It was a gorgeous summer day..

263
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,250
..July 7th, 1939.

264
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,850
In the afternoon, around 5 pm,

265
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,600
I was walking through the field.

266
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,970
Cornflowers behind the Berghof.

267
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,600
Suddenly he's standing there
painting her.

268
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,570
The way god made her, right
in front of this very mountain view.

269
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,220
What are you trying
to say, Professor?

270
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,020
Is this a Hitler or not?

271
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:10,910
Madame, one thing I can say without a doubt,
this is the most, most authentic Hitler.

272
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,940
My customer and I were very impressed by
the professors professional opinion.

273
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,050
The man obviously was an intimate expert
of neogermanic art history.

274
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,940
Fascinated I listened to the rest
of his statement when I got an idea.

275
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,510
My life's most fateful idea,

276
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,140
which would result in a body of
work of historic proportions.

277
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,940
The expert professor was not only present
when the painting was done...

278
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,310
.. he also knew why it had been lost for so long.

279
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:46,510
I know where this painting comes from
as I have written a famous book about it.

280
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,080
In "The Fuehrer and I" I exposed ...

281
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:55,310
...that in April of '45 the Fuehrer's entire
private archive was put in 10 metal boxes...

282
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,000
..and flown from the Reich's capital.

283
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,740
And this airplane, a Junkers-352,
was shot down by the enemy

284
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,250
in a town called Börnersdorf, close to the Czech border.

285
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:12,220
The metal boxes have been missing ever since.

286
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,480
10 boxes full of secret documents,
most private records,

287
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,000
the most secret secrets of the Fuehrer
and the person Adolf Hitler.

288
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,370
The Fuehrer cried
when he received this message.

289
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,850
Come on now.

290
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
We're no longer friends, you backstabber.

291
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,910
How often have you promise me that?

292
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,310
Give me an advance! 10k you asshole.

293
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,310
I'll give you nothing.

294
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,800
Give me 100.

295
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,370
Hermann, no.

296
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,200
Get rid of that junk and get us a big hit.

297
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
Not this crap. Then I'll
get you back into the money.

298
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,080
You'll do it, Hermann.

299
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
But what?

300
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,000
What? A big hit! You hear me?

301
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,080
Something with a bang
that jumps right at you.

302
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Right at the news stand.

303
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
If you're the reader.

304
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Bang, bang, bang!

305
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Understand?

306
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,110
A big hit.

307
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,510
You're all wet.

308
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,480
It's raining, professor.

309
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,220
Yes, yes, but I am busy right now.

310
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,880
I urgently have to write something.

311
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,620
Writing? I didn't know you
were a writer, too, professor.

312
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,880
I thought you were only a painter.

313
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,940
That, too. I art everything, I mean
I am an artistic all-rounder.

314
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,850
A little multi-talented genius.

315
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,940
I love little geniuses.

316
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,940
I see.

317
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,050
Martha, please cover up.
I really have to work now.

318
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,800
Baroness Freya von Hepp.

319
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,820
Does she have to be there again?

320
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,820
You are quiet now.

321
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,740
Karl Lentz and wife are doing the honor of inviting

322
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:15,420
Baroness Freya von Hepp to an evening of
comradeship on the occasion of Hitler's 90th.

323
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,020
P.S.: on this occasion I will allow myself
to present an unknown secret document

324
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,480
written by the Fuehrer himself.

325
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,080
Unknown secret document?

326
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,370
written by the Fuehrer himself. Freya!

327
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,370
It's all nonsense. He does
that every year.

328
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,280
Last year it was a dirty
napkin with the Fuehrer's boogers.

329
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,000
This year it'll be an old note
with an inkblot, no thanks.

330
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,080
We're going.

331
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
No, we're not.

332
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:58,220
That's bitter orange marmalade!

333
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,200
I told you I do not
like orange marmalade.

334
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,250
You did not say that to me.

335
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:10,740
I did. I repeatedly said I did
not want orange marmalade.

336
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,420
Hermann, what are you doing?

337
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,280
Hermann?

338
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,250
What are you doing?

339
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,250
I'm getting dressed.

340
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,250
And the I'll leave you.

341
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,770
Because of the marmalade?

342
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,770
No, because you do not obey me.

343
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,850
I cannot live with a woman
who does not obey.

344
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,420
(if I had to live without hope)

345
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,140
(if I had to believe nobody loved me)

346
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,600
(that there was no more happiness for me)

347
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,740
(that would be hard)

348
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:29,140
(if I didn't know in my heart that you once told me)

349
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,510
('I love you')

350
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,880
(Life would be without meaning for me)

351
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,940
(but I know more)

352
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:49,200
(I know a miracle will happen one day)

353
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,110
(and a thousand fairy tales will come true)

354
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:05,080
(I know a love cannot end this quickly)

355
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:12,620
(a love this big and wonderful)

356
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,250
(We're under the same star, your fate is mine)

357
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:31,020
(You're far yet so close as our souls are one)

358
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:36,450
(and that's why .....)

359
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,200
I won't do it.

360
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,910
Yes you will. Cut off 60 cm of the string
and bring it down here. Now!

361
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,140
A, A, where's that fucking A?

362
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,000
F. H.

363
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,910
F.H. , F.H., ... Fuehrer Hitler.

364
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,680
Fuck it.

365
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:50,800
Our Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler's secret diary from 1945.

366
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,140
The Fuehrer kept a diary?

367
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,710
You didn't know?

368
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,110
Classified. Property of the Fuehrer.

369
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,170
Keep shut at all times.

370
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,880
Open it, comrade Lentz.
I accept the responsibility.

371
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,650
Yes, Mr. Ober-Gruppenführer.

372
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,480
Open April 20th. Read.

373
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,170
Yes, Mr. Ober-Gruppenführer.

374
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,250
Here we go, April 20th, 1945.

375
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,480
Kotzestunk.

376
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,740
What?

377
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,170
Thank god, I finally woke up
from this horrible dream.

378
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:51,310
A true nightmare of euca... 
apocalyptic dimensions.

379
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:57,420
Dreamt that the plane was shot down.

380
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:07,020
The one that will bring my private archive
to my fortress in the Alps, tomorrow.

381
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,170
Gundelfinger, my loyal pilot, dead.

382
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,540
Exactly like that.

383
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,800
Shattered in a field in the middle of nowhere.

384
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:24,800
In my dream I heard the name of
a place I had never heard before.

385
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,820
Birnenschorf?

386
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,820
Börnersdorf!

387
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,770
Börnersdorf.

388
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,220
That is.... that is....

389
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,480
Inconceivable.

390
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,020
Read on, comrade.

391
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,880
All my paintings, my most 
private hand-written notes.

392
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:59,420
Even you my dear diary 
fell victim to the flames.

393
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,200
I did not cry during the Röhm-Putsch.

394
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,740
I did not cry on July 20th.

395
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,220
I didn't even shed a single tear during Stalingrad.

396
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,660
But tonight, I cried bitterly.

397
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,100
The Fuehrer cried.

398
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,080
Yes.

399
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,240
Didn't you know?

400
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,720
No.

401
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,380
That was...

402
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,940
.. a big hit.

403
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,720
Yes, that's sensational.

404
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,300
Truly a hit.

405
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,160
Allow me to introduce myself.

406
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,520
Prof. Dr. Fritz Knobel.

407
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Historian and antiques dealer.

408
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,100
Heil!

409
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,100
Heil!

410
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,140
Heil!

411
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,720
You could really get me Hitler's diary?

412
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,280
Anything you want. Everything
that's in those 10 metal boxes.

413
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,660
That's what I could get you.

414
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,020
Oh really, oh that would be....

415
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,860
You see, if somebody keeps a diary...

416
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,400
...he doesn't only write one...

417
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,360
Of course not.

418
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,400
...but several.

419
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,400
Of course.

420
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,180
Under certain circumstances I might have access.

421
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,280
Oh, really?

422
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,500
Via Leningrad, ...

423
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,220
.., Lehmberg, Leipzig, Lindau.

424
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,600
Vienna?

425
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,300
There's only the question if you can afford it, Mr. ..?

426
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,620
Hermann Willié with acute accent.

427
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,080
Money is not an issue. I always 
say you either have money or you don't.

428
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,640
I fully agree.

429
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
With acute accent,

430
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,420
Weiss-Magazin?

431
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,320
You're from the press?

432
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,360
Very interesting.

433
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,520
No it's not.

434
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,060
Why?

435
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,780
My husband wants nothing
to do with the press.

436
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,260
No, no.

437
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,400
Not at all, he has always avoided
the press, even as a child.

438
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,960
He never wanted to be in the papers.
He has always lied, he can't help it.

439
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,880
And what he just told you about boxes
and diaries is all made up.

440
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,300
Get out of here.

441
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,560
But pro..professor,... I...

442
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,600
Hermann, little man, look, ...

443
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,900
Freya!

444
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,120
Professor!

445
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,060
Hermann!

446
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,080
Being in the paper wouldn't exactly hurt my business.

447
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,260
Being in the paper as a forger! You tinkerer!

448
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,740
Professor!

449
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,100
Please wait.

450
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,060
Stop, stop, professor!

451
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,480
Hermann, little man, look,
Hitler did not keep a diary.

452
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,480
Yes, he did.

453
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,540
No, manny, he didn't.

454
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,140
You know what uncle Hermann
always said to us kids?

455
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,900
After writing "Mein Kampf"
the Fuehrer got a cramp

456
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,760
has a shaky hand,
what a blessing for the fatherland.

457
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
He couldn't really.

458
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
At least not with his hand.

459
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,120
It's a historic fact.

460
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,200
Börnersdorf

461
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,100
How much cash
do you have on you?

462
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,540
Don't know. Why? Maybe 2000 DM.

463
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,880
Say, you surely have a wife
and kids at home, don't you?

464
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,000
Eh, yes.

465
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So 2 grand is a lot of money for you, right?

466
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,720
Uhuh.

467
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,880
Say, you surely have a wife and kids at home.

468
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,600
So 500 DM is a lot of money for you, right?

469
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,120
I refuse to tolerate a personal question like that.

470
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,960
...while my colleagues are around.
Stop over there.

471
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,460
Börnersdorf.

472
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,300
Freya!

473
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,200
Hermann, I'm warning you.

474
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,780
Don't gyp me again like with that fake Chinaman.

475
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,560
That story about Mao
Tse-tung's gay swim instructor

476
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,860
who turned out to be Korean instead of Chinese

477
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,700
and who definitely couldn't swim.

478
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,200
But he was gay!

479
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,000
And if you can't fathom what a big hit this is

480
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,500
Adolf Hitler's secret diaries.

481
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,140
They aren't down there, are they?

482
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,360
No.

483
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,280
But I know where they are and I'll get 'em.

484
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,780
And if you can't fathom what a
big hit this is. Internationally. Bang, bang!

485
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,780
Bang.

486
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,820
Then you're an ignoramus
and and a huge asshole.

487
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,600
And the plane was all ablaze
and coming over those trees.

488
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,880
And?

489
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,460
We used to have trees here.

490
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,360
Now there aren't any trees.

491
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,920
And I thought 'he'll hit that barn'

492
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,440
But no, right where we are standing now

493
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,840
it went down.

494
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,200
I remember a man wanting out
but nothing could be done.

495
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,500
Everything was bent and hot.

496
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,240
Everything was burnt.

497
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,620
And then, with a single bang.

498
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,420
Total silence.

499
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,300
Terrible.

500
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,260
Great, I mean, gruesome.

501
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,420
A little question on the side:

502
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,120
What was aboard that plane?

503
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,440
Nothing, really, ...no..

504
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,500
Iron .. how do you say it...

505
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,280
Boxes? - Yes, boxes.

506
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,260
Iron boxes.

507
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,260
Did you hear, Hermann?

508
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,420
Holy cow, Hermann.

509
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,600
You know something?

510
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,900
I love you.

511
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,540
Well,

512
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,660
a whole lot of brown sauce.

513
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,140
Well, obviously you don't want it to drip on you.

514
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,740
Neither do I. But we have to remember that

515
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,040
competition is fierce.

516
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Not to mention we could 
sell this worldwide.

517
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,980
Just think about what the Americans
made with Einsteins diaries.

518
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,000
Millions.

519
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,140
I'm thinking globally
Hitler's the bigger name.

520
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:29,020
We've never had an author
like that in our paper.

521
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,480
This sleazy Willié, I mean,...

522
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,900
can't we put someone more professional
on it. It's such a delicate topic.

523
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,720
Does it have to be this sleazy Willié?

524
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,540
Yes, sleazy, that's exactly the right term for him.

525
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:55,300
But he's a true bloodhound with a good nose.

526
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,780
That guy has some nose, I tell you.

527
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,780
If he really works his way into this Hitler thing..

528
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,480
it'll be a big hit. I'll swear.

529
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,480
I'd like to give this top priority.

530
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,320
That's why I came straight to you, the boss.
Not the editorship.

531
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,300
Only you and me and this ..Willié.

532
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,560
My dear Mr. Willié,..

533
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
it's been too long.

534
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,140
We haven't met. I mean I've seen you
but you've never noticed me.

535
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,380
I'm very shortsighted.

536
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,260
What are you bringing me
today, old bloodhound?

537
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,020
This is the cockpit window of the
Ju-352 that crashed over Börnersdorf.

538
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,480
Ah, yes.

539
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,820
Fell from a height of 100 m from old 'Auntie Ju'...

540
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,920
..the parachute didn't open and
this trooper found his tomb.

541
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,200
Pardon?

542
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,420
Jup, we still sang that in the army in '64.

543
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,560
I was an ensign with the paratroopers.

544
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,420
May I ?

545
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,140
Exceptionally...

546
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,360
..aesthetic.

547
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,140
50, 100, 150, 200.

548
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,940
Thousand. - Thousand, yes.

549
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,360
50

550
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,000
100

551
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,260
150

552
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,960
200

553
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,500
Somebody was here. This is a wet spot
and it smells of semen.

554
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,100
Only I was here, by myself.

555
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,940
Masturbating?

556
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,000
Biggi.

557
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,680
Exactly.

558
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,500
Liar.

559
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,000
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and get that slut!

560
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,280
Don't you dare.

561
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,660
Oh I will, and I'll rub her nose in that
spot and then she'll tell me if you fucked her.

562
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,780
You lying son of a bitch.

563
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,660
Biggi, don't. Stay.

564
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,240
Please stay here.

565
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,200
I admit to everything.
You are completely right.

566
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,340
She was here and so was I.

567
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,380
And I am a lying....  well, like you said.

568
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,680
But please do me one favor,

569
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,680
don't take it personally.

570
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,680
You know what I'm like.

571
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,880
I can resist anything...

572
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
...except for temptation.

573
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,340
And it comes to me in all shapes and sizes.

574
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,500
I thought to myself.... cash is king.

575
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,940
You see? It's happening again.

576
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,260
Sausage platter.

577
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,260
Ah, yes.

578
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,680
Did she notice?

579
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,420
No.

580
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,400
I admitted to everything.

581
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,960
But I told you to lie!

582
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,700
I can't do that.

583
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,980
I cannot lie, Martha!

584
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,580
The world wants to be lied to.

585
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,740
Yes, yes.

586
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,740
Well, I just can't.

587
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,300
I can't lie.

588
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,300
Neither privately not professionally.

589
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,240
I just can't.

590
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,180
Yes, yes, I know, me neither.

591
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,980
It's a relief

592
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,520
to hear that you're so honest.

593
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,520
Because this thing can only happen
if we are both completely honest.

594
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,680
Of course, honestly.

595
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,820
And that's why I'm telling you quite frankly

596
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,720
that this thing needs to be completely secret.

597
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,880
Top secret.

598
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,880
Yes, yes, the highest degree.

599
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,740
I don't know you, you don't know me.

600
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,160
Of course not.

601
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:11,760
And these diaries would be coming
from Moscow via the GDR.

602
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,820
Moscow?

603
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,560
Yes, via Kiev, Warsaw, Potsdam, Pankow.

604
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,560
Bangkok?

605
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,200
Pankow!

606
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,640
Nobody knows, nobody may ever know.

607
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,240
They'll just appear, nobody knows from where.

608
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,620
And most importantly, they
may not be publicized.

609
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,680
Not publicized?

610
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,100
I fully agree.

611
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:44,100
However for a newspaper,
that is a very hard condition.

612
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,240
I don't know how to .... them in Hamburg.

613
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,400
You know Hamburg is Germany's leading press city.

614
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,780
If I approach them like "friends, don't publicize"...

615
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,740
That would be rather novel to them.

616
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,000
I don't mean not publicize them ever.

617
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:09,050
I mean, don't publish them before I give my OK.

618
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,720
From a safe space

619
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,920
where me and my associates from the East

620
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,770
Can be assured of out safety.

621
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:25,750
If Hitler's secret diaries are published,
heads will roll. What do you think!

622
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,300
The whole world will be
watching closely.

623
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,370
There will be a bang and we should
both be far away, dear Willié.

624
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,000
Taking cover from the KGB, BND, AEG.

625
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,570
AEG?

626
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,170
I mean ARD..eh.. that acadamic research thing...eh...

627
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,320
I see.

628
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:49,620
Mossad, Stasi, CIA. I have no use for
money that will only buy me a coffin.

629
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,570
No,no, despite all my passion for it

630
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,400
I am not suicidal.

631
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,150
When I think about what's in store for me..

632
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,920
All the burden I take on with 25 to 30 volumes.

633
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,670
There are 30 volumes?

634
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,000
Roughly. It depends on what's being
delivered and what's being paid.

635
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,770
How about 40k?

636
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,770
40000?

637
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,770
A piece?

638
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:37,470
Well, er, I mean, we should be able to find a way.

639
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,870
I think, maybe one or two.

640
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,220
Shall we say 3 for 120?

641
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,770
I'll give you an advance of 10%.

642
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,370
12000 DM and the rest upon delivery.

643
00:51:55,050 --> 00:52:02,470
These are 1,2,3,4...

644
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,200
80, 90, 100

645
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,900
110, 120, 130

646
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,100
140

647
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,570
I hope that engine will run.

648
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:05,020
Empty. I think fried eggs and coffee
aren't good for my stomach.

649
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,370
Maybe chamomile tea and Zwieback?

650
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,900
Oh yes, please!

651
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,650
And maybe some very light oatmeal?

652
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,520
That would be sweet.

653
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,520
Fritzken,

654
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,350
just say what you need, I'll do anything for you.

655
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,720
Ugh!

656
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,070
What's upP?

657
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,420
No, no, just your strong smell.

658
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,120
From my mouth?

659
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,170
Yes.

660
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,520
24.02.1940

661
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:56,620
The superhuman efforts

662
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,720
of the recent past

663
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:05,920
are giving me gas in my intestines.

664
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:12,320
And Eva says I have bad breath.

665
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:17,500
When I think about what
we are holding in our hands here.

666
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,900
What his hands touched.

667
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:27,470
When I think about that ... here and now....

668
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:31,820
I'm touching what he held in his hands.

669
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:41,270
Then, I get a whiff of something.. like an emotion.

670
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,850
Something like history's ice cold breath.

671
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,500
I have to admit.

672
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,900
What did I want to say?

673
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,620
Right, what's in them?

674
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,770
I did not dare to break the seal,
my Fuehrer, I mean, ... doctor.

675
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:10,320
It says so on them....
that only authorized people.... explicitly.

676
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,620
Top secret. Property of the Fuehrer. Keep shut.

677
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,400
And so on... Bohrmann.

678
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,250
Well, eh, ..

679
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:26,870
That falls under the statute of limitations, right?

680
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,500
I mean it does not apply for us anymore.

681
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,400
Pass me those scissors.

682
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,370
Ah, right, that is written in old German.

683
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,370
That's how the Fuehrer wrote.

684
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,550
Yes, yes.

685
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,770
Kept astoundingly well.

686
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,770
Beautiful old German writing.

687
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:10,720
Too bad, ... too bad, that I cannot read this now.

688
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:16,270
Back with the Hitler Youth I used to ....
we didn't read or write much, but..

689
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,270
If you like, I can try.

690
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:26,670
Here it says February 24th, 1942.

691
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,600
February 24th.

692
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:29,720
1940

693
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,770
Right.

694
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:38,870
And then, ... aha, ... the Ü, eh, U,...

695
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:49,770
... the superhuman efforts ...

696
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:58,050
..of the recent past...

697
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:17,750
.... are giving me gas ....

698
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,950
..in my intestines.

699
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:27,320
Gas in my intestines. Incredible. So intimate.

700
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,520
Carry on.

701
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,500
Gas in my intestines and Eversack.

702
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,400
Eversack?

703
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,400
Who's Eversack?

704
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,920
Eversack is bardbath.

705
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:50,920
Maybe he's alluding to a person
named Eversack Bardbath. Sounds Jewish.

706
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,650
Maybe bad breath?

707
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,070
As I was saying Eversack is a Jew.

708
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:09,300
And his real last name is badbreath,
and Hitler found out or something....

709
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,050
Just a minute.

710
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:25,470
Now I know. Incredible.
Such human grandeur.

711
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,020
Uncompromising authenticity.

712
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,020
Go on, what does it say?

713
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:39,600
It says: The superhuman efforts of recent times
are giving me gas in my intestines.

714
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,350
And Eva says...that I have bad breath.

715
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,850
That is...

716
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,850
..that is...

717
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,850
That is sensational.

718
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,520
Adolf Hitler privately.

719
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,870
A person like me and you.

720
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,850
That's a worldwide sensation, gentlemen.

721
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,400
Hermann.

722
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:18,570
600.000, 700.000, 800.000,....
I guess I need to go to the bank.

723
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,970
Go ahead, where's the problem?

724
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,450
Bank's are still closed.

725
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,450
Well then open one!

726
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:10,700
I am happy to hear you like it.

727
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,970
The way the Fuehrer wrote it, Mr. Willié.

728
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:15,850
Hermann.

729
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,020
Hermann from now on.

730
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,420
It's not like I know what 's in them, Hermann.

731
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:26,150
I was afraid you guys
might not like it. Historically.

732
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:30,170
Historically this is of greatest importance

733
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:32,170
for Germany, for the entire world.

734
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:34,670
Really?

735
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,670
Every word is most important.

736
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:39,020
He's sharing his innermost thoughts every day.

737
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,050
Is that true.

738
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:48,170
I haven't read it but it's possible
he wrote a bunch of bullshit, right?

739
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,500
No?

740
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,170
Fritz, if you value our friendship

741
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:59,170
don't talk like that about
the Fuehrer in my presence.

742
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,250
Sorry, Hermann, I didn't mean it like that.

743
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:06,000
Nevermind. When can you deliver
the remaining 25 books?

744
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,920
25?

745
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,100
Yes, chop chop, asap.

746
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,220
Put some pressure on them,
they're getting paid for it!

747
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:18,700
Here's another 100.000, as an advance.

748
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:29,900
Thank you, Hermann.

749
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:13,170
Dr. Wieland may I introduce Baroness von Hepp.

750
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:15,570
The niece of the Reichsmarschall.

751
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:16,320
What?

752
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,600
Göring.

753
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,870
Frau Göring...

754
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,020
Von Hepp

755
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,020
Oh, pardon.

756
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,470
No need to apologize
I'm not ashamed of my uncle.

757
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,700
Neither do I.

758
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,820
My uncle, e.g. was in the resistance.

759
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:35,200
Yes, I guess neither of us
is to blame for their families.

760
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,800
Of course not, quite the contrary,
maybe the two have met.

761
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,470
I'd say never mind and cheers.

762
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,200
Champagne!

763
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:56,750
I meant your uncle, .. my uncle, ... eh...

764
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:57,050
You're not only weak...
you're a pig.

765
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,270
Oh Fritz, ... come here, just once more.

766
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,520
That's enough.

767
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:17,070
January 30th, 1933

768
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:20,420
I need to have a serious talk with Eva.

769
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:23,720
She believes a man spearheading Germany

770
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,570
has spare time for private affairs

771
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:35,600
In her youth she does not realize the constant
struggle the German chancellor is facing.

772
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,900
August 1st, 1936

773
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,750
I opened the Olympic Summer Games 1936

774
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:48,050
All events are sold out. 
I hope I'll get tickets for Eva.

775
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:51,450
November 19th, 1942

776
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:55,250
At the east face of Watzmann
three young mountaineers were under distress.

777
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:00,670
I sent 50 mountain infantrists to their rescue.

778
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,650
What cheek!

779
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:19,100
This is beyond belief.

780
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:20,670
What?

781
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,670
Why does nobody show this to us?

782
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,670
Oh, I see.

783
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,320
Why? We are showing it to you right now.

784
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Why are we finding out now.

785
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,300
Why is the editorship being left out?

786
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,820
Who's leaving you out we are 
putting all our cards on the table.

787
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:40,370
We're just asking you if you would be interested
in publishing Hitler's secret diaries.

788
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:45,420
Pardon me Mr. Willié but that's not the point.
Hitler's secret diaries would be a hit.

789
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:46,650
Globally.

790
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,650
Oh, really, you think?

791
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:54,070
It's beyond comprehension, indeed. I mean

792
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,420
This discovery is so unusual and astounding...

793
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,720
...knowing Mr. Willié I have only one question:

794
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,100
Which one?

795
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,100
Are they real?

796
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,100
Great question, Uwe.

797
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,920
What do you mean, 'real'?
I don't get it.

798
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,300
Yes, no, I mean, me neither.

799
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:20,750
That maybe, but this first letter
here looks like an 'F' to me.

800
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,050
And his name was hardly Fritze Hitler.

801
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:25,620
That's an F? ... FH?

802
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:32,120
That's an 'A', not an 'F'.

803
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:37,520
No, it's clearly an....'F'...'FH'.

804
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,420
Fuehrer Hitler.

805
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,620
That's it, "Fuehrer Hitler".

806
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,000
Nonsense, Fuehrer Hitler...

807
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,520
Maybe 'Flags high", Uwe.

808
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,520
Nonsense.

809
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,850
Fuehrer...Fuehrer

810
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:58,850
Fuehrer Hail

811
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:00,520
Fuehrer's Hound

812
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,520
Fuehrer's dog?

813
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,220
Fuehrer's Hand?

814
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,700
Fuehrer's ...

815
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:14,020
Head...quarters. Führerhauptquartier!

816
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,350
Fuehrer Headquarters

817
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,900
February 6th, 1943

818
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:32,800
Last weeks tension took a
toll on my health.

819
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:38,120
I have caught a cold from
driving with the roof down.

820
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,350
I have a temperature of 39.5°C.

821
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,570
I have to interrupt my work repeatedly

822
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:56,520
Even the most simple tasks
are causing me great difficulties.

823
01:09:56,770 --> 01:10:00,850
I am using up a huge amount of these
convenient new paper tissues.

824
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:07,850
I am constantly shaken by
violent sneezing spells.

825
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:17,770
I'm taking lots of medications.

826
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:19,870
I feel very groggy.

827
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,870
I have strong headaches..

828
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:26,220
..sometimes it's so bad that
I have a constant ringing in my ears.

829
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:36,570
It rings, and rings, and rings, and rings.

830
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,800
What do you look like?

831
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,800
What do you mean?

832
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,800
I look bad.

833
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,620
Last weeks tensions took a
toll on my health.

834
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:06,900
I have caught a cold from
driving in a convertible.

835
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,670
Here, I have a temperature of 39.5°C

836
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,870
Fritz, we need to get an expertise.

837
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,200
What kind of expertises?

838
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:20,050
The editorship wants expertises by independent experts

839
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:25,500
which prove beyond any doubt that
the author is Adolf Hitler and nobody else.

840
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,970
I think that is....

841
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,520
I find that..., eh...

842
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,970
That's a great idea, Hermann.

843
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:37,970
Not a problem.

844
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,670
We'll do a handwriting analysis.

845
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,170
Handwriting analysis?

846
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:48,150
Yes, you take the original diary in
the Fuehrer's original handwriting,

847
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:53,920
and compare it to another original writing
done by the original Fuehrer

848
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,720
also in the same original handwriting.

849
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,850
And then you can compare one
original with the other.

850
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,700
And where can I get such an
original writing by the Fuehrer?

851
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,850
From the Fuehrer, I mean from me,
from those metal boxes.

852
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:12,170
I'll have to look if I still 
have something by the Fuehrer.

853
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:54,370
Cognac?

854
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,720
The bottle is in the bunker.

855
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:16,450
In the name of the German people
I order Prof. Dr. Ing. hc. Ferdinand Porsche

856
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:20,650
to invent a novel 4-cylinder motor vehicle

857
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,270
with an air-cooled standard engine

858
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,570
priced like a midsize motorbike

859
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:29,600
low-maintenance, sturdy, with low fuel consumption.

860
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:34,120
a car for the entire German people

861
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:39,450
A true Volkswagen. Signed, Adolf Hitler.

862
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:44,600
Oh dear, he has invented the beetle.

863
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,750
Yes, and it still runs.

864
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,000
40.5°C.

865
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,600
I hope he doesn't die.

866
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,500
He's never had a fever this high with me.

867
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,500
Not with me, either.

868
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,920
How can the doctor say he's fine
when he's burning up.

869
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,850
His hear is beating as if it might
tear him apart any minute.

870
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,320
Say something, Fritz.

871
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:13,750
Fritzken, tell us what's wrong.

872
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:19,000
F...f....fear.

873
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,100
You don't need to be afraid any more.
Martha and I had a talk.

874
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,550
Woman to woman.

875
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:29,750
We get along very well now.

876
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:34,570
It keeps getting better and better

877
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,320
Can you keep a secret, father?

878
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,300
What?

879
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,050
Do you know the Corinthians?

880
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:10,300
Yes, I, Paul,...
Do you know the Corinthians?

881
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,670
Yes, I, Paul,...

882
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,670
etc., etc., yes, yes,...

883
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:18,350
Now imagine you were suspecting
that these epistles were forgeries.

884
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,200
What?

885
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:26,620
Not General Paul, I mean the Apostle Paul was the author
but a sleazy, little, ......

886
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,920
militaria dealer from Jerusalem.

887
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,850
But why?

888
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,920
Maybe for 20000 silver pieces.

889
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,500
Per epistle.

890
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,750
From whom?

891
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:39,850
From some big paper. Jerusalem magazine or something.

892
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,270
You're in feverish delirium.

893
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:49,250
No, no, no, father,...  imagine you suspected
that somebody screwed you over.

894
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:53,350
Wouldn't you have to go to your boss?

895
01:16:53,350 --> 01:17:00,420
And tell the holy father that this
Corinthian thing smells,

896
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,420
we shouldn't publish them.

897
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,370
Prof. Dr. Jäggi from Zurich

898
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:07,600
was able to verify beyond reasonable doubt

899
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:14,020
that the documents presented come from
the same author, Adolf Hitler.

900
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:16,670
Slower and more clearly, please.

901
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:28,850
Steward Rosenzweig, New York City:
After extensive analysis of the handwriting...

902
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:39,070
and comparison with the different
documents provided by you

903
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:43,370
..I have come to the conclusion
that Hitler wrote all of them.

904
01:18:54,270 --> 01:19:04,670
Prof. Dr. Siegfried Kessel, London.... I recognize 
a handwriting very familiar to me....

905
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,370
..that of our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler.

906
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:16,400
One is neutral, one's a Jew, one's an old Nazi.
You can hardly ask for more.

907
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,500
What's up Hermann, 
aren't you happy?

908
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,970
I never doubted it for a second.

909
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,970
Exactly.

910
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,820
Yes.

911
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,600
Hermann

912
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:07,350
(my ideal in this world is a hero,
a tall, blonde man)

913
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:14,220
(he comes from a fairyland and gives me his big
strong hand which could rip me apart)

914
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:21,220
(that's what my dream man looks like
his name is Ralf or Peer)

915
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:27,270
(my reality looks very different though, won't you listen to this)

916
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:31,050
(he's called Waldemar and he has black hair)

917
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:34,670
(he's neither proud nor bold but I love him)

918
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:38,170
(he's called Waldemar, he won't be a star)

919
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:41,400
(his home is Berlin, but I love him)

920
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,750
(the boy is the opposite of my ideal)

921
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:48,020
(I don't understand myself but I don't care)

922
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,550
(he's called Waldemar, he has little money)

923
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:54,870
(I'll never get an ermine but I love him)

924
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:58,850
Fritz! Fritzken! Seriously.

925
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:06,270
Are you also trade east to west?

926
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,520
East to west?

927
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,820
yes, no, Miss Martha is a close
confidante of my husband.

928
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,920
His..

929
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,170
secretary

930
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:19,900
private secretary.

931
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:23,750
my husband's business has grown so much

932
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:24,900
Oh really?

933
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:30,600
Yes, he's expanding every day.
He's bubbling over with ideas.

934
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,350
Can you see this small white dust?

935
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,120
That her.

936
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,400
Eva?

937
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,400
Yes, Eva.

938
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:50,000
and the bigger, grayish brown, coarser particles, that's him.

939
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,550
Adolf?

940
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:52,620
Yes.

941
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:54,820
Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun.

942
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,950
Forever and ever.

943
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:57,150
united in death

944
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:00,150
Mixed. Can't be told apart by a layman.

945
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,600
How much would you want for it?

946
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,020
Well, this is priceless, really.

947
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,620
If at all, I'll only sell the bundle.

948
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:10,620
What bundle?

949
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,200
Imagine what has come to light!

950
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,720
What?

951
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:26,900
I've just heard from a trustworthy source in Potsdam.
The Fuehrer didn't write 30 diaries, he wrote 60!

952
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:31,050
60? Fritz! That would be...

953
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:33,050
expensive, Hermann. Expensive.

954
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,220
40k per volume won't be enough.

955
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:40,900
And there's lots more.

956
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:45,170
Secret documents, paintings, 
all very secret.

957
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:49,170
Fritz, give me a spoon full.

958
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:51,170
Please.

959
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:54,570
Just a single one.

960
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:59,000
No, Hermann, I can't just
tear the two apart like that.

961
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,720
Then give me two.

962
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,420
Dear colleagues, I am happy
you made it after all.

963
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,000
Dear Uwe, dear Kurt.

964
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,070
It's our pleasure.

965
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,500
Yes, indeed, Hermann.

966
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:55,100
Dear colleagues, let me introduce you to
Lieutenant General von Klantz from the SS

967
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,970
and Mr. Strasser, the Fuehrer's art expert.

968
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:01,950
Dear Lieutenant General, Dear Professor,

969
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:06,500
Our editorship is reporting for duty
if I may say so.

970
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,120
It's a big honor, Gentlemen,

971
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,720
to finally be opening the eyes of the German
people and the rest of the world.

972
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:17,620
We are fully aware, Lieutenant Colonel,
.. I mean Lieutenant General.

973
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:22,520
..and to be saying loudly and clearly, that

974
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,670
there was a human heart in
the Fuehrer's chest, as well.

975
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,670
And what a heart!

976
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,200
One, two, one, two.

977
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:36,300
Ladies and Gentlemen,

978
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,720
tonight we're celebrating with our host,

979
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,100
our dear old friend Hermann,

980
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:48,020
his 30 year anniversary in the business.

981
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:51,700
How he's achieved all of this with such bravery,

982
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,050
such success,

983
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:56,920
and never-ending commitment,

984
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,220
will now be told by my little song.

985
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:12,720
That's how I paid for college.

986
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:28,070
(Hermann, you're a man who walks his path by himself)

987
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:36,300
(Hermann, you look ahead, even if fate says 'no')

988
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:43,700
(Hermann, you've got heart,
you're no stranger to pain)

989
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:51,120
(just a single joke and you take courage again)

990
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:58,670
(You can't be stopped,
you're boldly reaching for the stars)

991
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:05,050
(You'll chase happiness near and far)

992
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:11,120
(You've got a nose for the big hit)

993
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:16,800
(Mao Zedong, Lumumba, and Kongo-Müller)

994
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:23,220
(Hermann, Hermann Willié, with acute accent)

995
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:29,070
(You're the best nose aboard this ship)

996
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:36,070
(Hermann, Hermann Willié, with acute accent)

997
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:41,920
(You're the best nose aboard this ship)

998
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:48,770
(Hermann, Hermann Willié, with acute accent)

999
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:54,850
(You're the best nose aboard this ship)

1000
01:27:54,850 --> 01:28:01,470
(Hermann, Hermann Willié, with acute accent)

1001
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:08,300
(You're the best nose aboard this ship)

1002
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,350
You look all messed up.

1003
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:42,550
That's your passion, Hermann.

1004
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,270
Oh, really?

1005
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:50,120
Can't you at least put makeup on
before you come to breakfast?

1006
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,400
At your age.

1007
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,370
You look all wrinkly.

1008
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:12,200
Orange marmalade. Again!

1009
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:24,450
You bitch!

1010
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,900
I'm leaving now. Forever.

1011
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,400
Well,

1012
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,420
Don't speak. Whatever you're about to say is a lie.

1013
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:54,850
You think you're on the way up now.

1014
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:58,600
And there's no more room for
people who knew you before.

1015
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,600
I get it.

1016
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:05,100
And I get that you want
your triumph all to yourself.

1017
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:09,420
Hope you'll get there. Hermann. Adieu.

1018
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:19,820
Adieu.

1019
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,750
Into the trash? You're throwing out my paper?

1020
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:56,220
This perfectly terrible East German paper?

1021
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:02,220
You throw out this precious
old paper like it was junk!

1022
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:09,700
Every single night for over a year
now I sit at this goddamn table

1023
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:14,050
in front of these damn journals
until I want to puke.

1024
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:18,250
57 volumes of Adolf, written by Hand,
Biggi, you know what that means?

1025
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:20,950
I don't know who I am anymore.

1026
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:22,950
That I believe.

1027
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:27,400
I know his handwriting better than my own.
I've lost my own.

1028
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,450
I've put in superhuman efforts, Biggi.

1029
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:38,670
And I will shortly have created
the world's biggest work of forgery.

1030
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,270
And the two of you..?

1031
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:42,450
We're cleaning up.

1032
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:44,020
It was about time.

1033
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:47,250
You are  destroying my means of production!

1034
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:49,720
I have very lucrative orders!

1035
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:54,170
Hitler's book on women.

1036
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:56,650
Hitler's novel on Ludwig II.

1037
01:32:56,650 --> 01:33:00,200
Hitler on Blondie, the German
shepherd through the millenia

1038
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,200
and my opera, Biggi

1039
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,200
Opera? You're a composer, too?

1040
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,050
Nonsense, shut up you stupid cow.

1041
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:08,320
Biggi, I want to write my opera.

1042
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,950
Fritz, get that thought out of your head.

1043
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:14,220
Oh, Biggi, what a smash hit that would be!

1044
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:19,950
Wayland, the Smith. A comedic opera
by Adolf Knobel, I mean, Hitler.

1045
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:22,500
Conducted by Leni v. Riefenstahl.

1046
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,800
Conducted by Karajan, premieres in Bayreuth.

1047
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,800
That would be.....

1048
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:32,120
That would be a cultural world sensation!

1049
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,400
Biggi, and you and me...

1050
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,370
and me?

1051
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:41,500
Yes, you too. The three of us
are sitting in the first row.

1052
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,070
You'll be sitting in jail, not in the first row.

1053
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:03,650
What do you think, heads are going to roll

1054
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:08,970
when Hitler's secret diaries are published
the whole world will be watching

1055
01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:10,970
very closely.

1056
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:18,900
It'll cause such a bang that
we'll better take cover far, far away.

1057
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,820
Thank you, thank you.

1058
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:23,350
Thank you, thank you.

1059
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:27,500
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1060
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:34,350
Ladies and Gentlemen, dear colleagues,

1061
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,950
I am happy about the turnout.

1062
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:40,500
I am opening our press conference

1063
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:48,570
Welcoming journalists from 87 nations
as well as 24 foreign TV stations.

1064
01:35:51,500 --> 01:36:00,350
From this day on,
vast parts of German history need to be rewritten.

1065
01:36:06,570 --> 01:36:11,220
Just between us two, this is an F, not an A, right?

1066
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:13,070
And he surely wasn't called Ferdinand.

1067
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:14,150
Of course not.

1068
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:15,620
So what does FH stand for?

1069
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,650
Something's rotten, Lieutenant General.

1070
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,650
A forgery, Lieutenant General.

1071
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,350
Didn't you know?

1072
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:30,900
(Do I dream? Am I awake? Do I cry? Do I laugh?
today I don't know what I'm doing)

1073
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:38,770
(Where I stand and walk people are smiling at me)

1074
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:47,400
(Today fairy tales come true and I realize..)

1075
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:51,520
(This will only happen once and won't come again)

1076
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:55,150
(It's too good to be true)

1077
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,350
(Like a miracle it's shining down on us)

1078
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:03,150
(A golden light from paradise)

1079
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:07,100
(This will only happen once and won't come again)

1080
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:10,770
(It might only be a dream)

1081
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:14,570
(This only comes around once in a lifetime)

1082
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:18,370
(It might be over tomorrow)

1083
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:22,470
(This only comes around once in a lifetime)

1084
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:25,950
(There's only one May each spring)

1085
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:37,050
(This will only happen once and won't come again)

1086
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:40,850
(It's too good to be true)

1087
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:45,050
(Like a miracle it's shining down on us)

1088
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:48,850
(A golden light from paradise)

1089
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:52,470
(...)

1090
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:46,270
Hermann, Hermann

1091
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:55,550
Here's the newest expertise
from the Federal Criminal Agency.

1092
01:38:55,550 --> 01:39:00,170
Another one? Great, leave it with the others
and grab a bottle of champagne.

1093
01:39:00,170 --> 01:39:02,200
Hermann!

1094
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:13,950
The Hitler diaries were certainly
produced after the war.

1095
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:20,470
The tacking threads and glue used
had not yet been available during the Third Reich.

1096
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:25,900
With regards to content
it's a superficial product

1097
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:31,700
of a forger of limited intellectual capacity.

1098
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:41,250
Passports, please.

1099
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:45,250
The Count

1100
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:48,680
The Countess

1101
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:52,970
Your highness.

1102
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:54,970
There you go.

1103
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:56,970
Safe travels.

1104
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:05,880
Hermann, if you say the words 'big hit'
one more time, I'll punch you in the face.

1105
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:16,110
Don't you realize? If the diaries are in Hitler's handwriting...

1106
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:19,710
..and we have three expertises that prove that...

1107
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:24,450
..but the paper was produced after the war...

1108
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:28,000
..that can only mean...

1109
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,420
..that you cheated us out of 9 million DM.

1110
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:35,710
For bad breath and gas.

1111
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,220
Unsavory smut.

1112
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:40,220
Tasteless.

1113
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:42,220
Disgusting.

1114
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:44,220
No, no, no.

1115
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:50,740
That can only mean that Adolf Fuehrer

1116
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:53,420
must have written his diaries

1117
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:55,820
after his death.

1118
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,620
And since the dead can't write

1119
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:01,080
that can only mean that

1120
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:03,080
he lives.

1121
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:06,280
Who's alive?

1122
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:09,370
Adolf Hitler.

1123
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:12,280
He's alive.

1124
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:19,600
That's the hit of the millennium.

1125
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:22,110
he..

1126
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,570
he lives...

1127
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,570
Yeah, right.

1128
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,020
Yes, yes.

1129
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,080
He lives.

1130
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:52,000
I'll prove it to you.

1131
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:54,570
I'll look for him.

1132
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:56,910
and I'll find him

1133
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,600
and when I've found him

1134
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:01,600
I'll bring him right here

1135
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:04,220
to Hamburg.

1136
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:14,220
Hamburg is Germany's leading press city.

1137
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:22,910
You've gotten me into
hot water, Gentlemen.
