00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,839
<i>Hi. I'm Bert Rodriguez
from En Pelotas Magazine,</i>

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,163
the Latin's world numero uno source
for breaking sexy news.

3
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:23,427
Chronicler, if you will,
of the secret history of Hollywood.

4
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,690
Humble memorialist of the
vertiginous ups and precipitous downs

5
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:28,963
of the world's greatest
female porn stars

6
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,779
because porn stars
are people too.

7
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,433
And I don't mean objectifying them.
No, sir.

8
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,919
<i>En Pelotas is about paying tribute
to those Amazon creatures</i>

9
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:41,537
walking among us
who make the term "sex goddess"

10
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:44,292
sound woefully undernourished.

11
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:46,470
And in a world increasingly known

12
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:49,733
for its surgical enhancements
and questionable pubic hairstyles,

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,437
one performer stands...
Or is it stood?... taller than the rest.

14
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:57,734
And that is the "initimable"...

15
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:00,419
And that is the ininim...

16
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:05,315
And that is the inimitable
Elektra Luxx.

17
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:09,641
<i>Let me take you back to a time before
all the acclaim, the drug busts,</i>

18
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:12,586
<i>before the high-profile affair
with Nick Chapel</i>

19
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:14,886
<i>and the detritus
of their ensuing sex tape.</i>

20
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:18,827
Let me deposit you in the wasteland
of adult entertainment in the '90s.

21
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:22,916
A dark era in which the silicone craze
erupted like a Macedonic volcano

22
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,661
and gonzo slayed the plot-driven
pictures of yesteryear.

23
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,290
Even in that toxic environment,

24
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:31,015
she managed to elevate
standard mature programmers

25
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:35,273
<i>such as Sticky Sweet Volume 2
and Natural Born Killer Naturals.</i>

26
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:37,444
Eventually earning herself
an unprecedented

27
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:40,581
five consecutive Fox of the
Year awards from the AWN.

28
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:43,498
But if one performance
perfectly captures the moment

29
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:46,597
where she turned the page
and went from promising sex kitten

30
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,621
to behemothic superstar,

31
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,044
it would have to be her turn
as twin nymphomaniac sisters

32
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:55,207
<i>in the precisely titled
2 Nymphomaniac Twin Sisters.</i>

33
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:59,203
It is here that Elektra first puts into
play her look-to-the-camera theory.

34
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,703
<i>The rest, as they say, is history.
Take a look.</i>

35
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,300
<i>With this seemingly harmless</i>

36
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:06,829
<i>breaking of the proverbial
fourth wall,</i>

37
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,413
<i>Miss Luxx pretty much started
a revolution.</i>

38
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:12,333
Seems immaterial now,
but at the time, there were rumors

39
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:14,863
she had looked at the camera
awaiting direction

40
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:18,766
or simply thought the camera was
in another place altogether. Nonsense.

41
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:21,449
<i>Take a look at
Dial SS for Super Sex.</i>

42
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:23,694
Am I interrupting something?

43
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:26,475
- It's her. It's Super Sex.
- Huh?

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,910
What do you bad boys want
all that money for?

45
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,960
- To get some pussy.
- Buy some beer.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,748
Let's deal with the beer later.

47
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,506
First things first.

48
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,492
<i>BERT: And here she is in
The Best Girl Scout Cookies.</i>

49
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:51,310
We're lost, totally lost.

50
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:54,474
It'll be hours before
they send out a search party.

51
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:58,634
I will gather some sticks
to make a fire.

52
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,932
I know a better way to keep warm.

53
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:07,147
We can't. I asked your group
leader, Stacey, to marry me.

54
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:08,688
So marry her.

55
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:14,515
Group Leader Stacey taught me
to share and we share everything.

56
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:18,546
<i>The success of
2 Nymphomaniac Twin Sisters</i>

57
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,807
was such that the producers
signed her up for the hotter sequel:

58
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:24,754
2 Nymphomaniac Twin Sisters Il:
Wetter Than Seattle.

59
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,891
This is the one
with the famous orgy scene

60
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:28,949
in which Elektra joins herself
in bed

61
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,425
<i>for what Adult World News
called the big bang of all sex scenes.</i>

62
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:34,057
WOMAN:
Berto!

63
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:36,973
What?

64
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,995
WOMAN:
You told me you took out the trash.

65
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:41,330
I did! I did take it out!

66
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,539
It won every major award
at the AWN show,

67
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,459
including two best actress statuettes
for Miss Luxx.

68
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:57,452
WOMAN: You didn't take it out!
- Mom, please not now! Please!

69
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:05,398
The industry being as literal as it is,
Elektra soon starred

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,205
as the world's most jaw-droppingly
curvilinear astrophysicist

71
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,986
<i>in The Big Bang,
earning herself another nomination</i>

72
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,448
for best group sex scene, but
losing to newcomer Venus Azucar

73
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,845
in what is still
a hotly debated decision.

74
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,375
WOMAN:
When are you going to take it out?

75
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:23,932
When you begin to mount the edge of
the most fantastic shivering spasm,

76
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,399
it's not bad form to look him
in the eye and say:

77
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,454
"I don't know where I'm going,
but if you move, I will kill you."

78
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,270
And if you're with a woman,
you might also compliment her hair.

79
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,092
Nothing makes us more insecure,

80
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,080
even with our ankles
behind our ears,

81
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:40,281
than our hair looking all funny.

82
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:41,431
Yes, Maria.

83
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:46,174
WOMAN: My husband often complains
that I'm too quiet during...

84
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,418
You know.

85
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:51,099
But I don't really know what to say
because I'm concentrating myself.

86
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,306
Well, verbal reinforcement
is a must.

87
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:56,738
If the man is fucking you
with wild abandon, it is your duty

88
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:59,355
and your privilege
to encourage him.

89
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,008
- Mrs. Turner.
- Oh, well,

90
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:07,264
...if the man is already doing the...
- If he's already inside you, yeah.

91
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:11,298
Isn't it then, quite frankly, a little
redundant to be talking about it?

92
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,949
No, no, no. Men are very insecure.

93
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:17,793
And it is critical that you reaffirm.
This is of vital importance.

94
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,996
Also, they are primarily
visual creatures.

95
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,336
Don't keep your faces
scrunched up the whole time.

96
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:24,574
That's a mistake first-timers
make on camera.

97
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,651
At least before Botox
changed the game.

98
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,664
Same thing in the privacy
of your own home.

99
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:33,474
Men require encouragement.
I cannot emphasize this enough.

100
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,788
- What is it, Dolores?
- It's nothing.

101
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,350
You've been wanting
to say something.

102
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:41,856
I'm fine.

103
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:44,731
What is it? We're all friends.

104
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:48,541
I had this horrible experience
last week with my boyfriend and...

105
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,132
- What's wrong with your eye?
- Nothing.

106
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,732
But it keeps twitching.

107
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:55,938
Oh, uh, well...

108
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,196
That's just it.

109
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:06,242
I was practicing the oral technique
you suggested

110
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,567
and when it was time...

111
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,925
I timed it all wrong and...

112
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,838
- It's okay, let it all out.
- And it all went in my eye

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,904
and I went blind and I had to
be rushed to the emergency room.

114
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:21,666
Blind?

115
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,488
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,013
You were giving
on your knees.

117
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,063
And where
was your hair?

118
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,269
It... Well, he was
holding it back.

119
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:33,473
- That wasn't a problem.
- And he was standing.

120
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:36,293
He was on the couch
just like you said, and I was...

121
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:38,597
I was giving him
that devouring look.

122
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:43,335
I said, "Didn't you promise me
a pearl necklace?"

123
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:47,139
Obviously, in my whole life,
I never said that before.

124
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:48,420
I'm very proud of you.

125
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:52,032
I didn't even get to say "necklace"
because suddenly,

126
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:56,840
this whip strikes across my eye
and my vision goes all blurry

127
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,076
and I fall back and I...

128
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:02,659
So you fell off the horse.
Most natural thing in the world.

129
00:09:02,828 --> 00:09:04,136
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:06,666
And nothing else to do
but get right back on.

131
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:11,051
The whole ride, the
paramedic was snickering facts

132
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:15,849
about how the prostaglandin
and the citric acid in his semen

133
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:20,291
was not compatible
with my contact-lens solution.

134
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:22,695
And your boyfriend?

135
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,421
Oh, he felt so bad for me.

136
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:28,194
He punched that ambulance driver
when he was driving

137
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:32,522
and he got me
a real pearl necklace.

138
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:35,556
WOMEN: Aw.
- They're Japanese. So, yeah.

139
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,068
All right.

140
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,342
That's it for today.

141
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,550
Oh, Father McKinley
needs the room next week,

142
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,125
so we will start at 6:00.

143
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,849
- Miss Luxx?
- Yeah?

144
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,733
Miss Luxx, you don't
know me. My name is Cora.

145
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:06,986
- Oh, you just missed class.
- I'm not here for your class.

146
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,866
I need to speak to you
about something else.

147
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:11,622
Oh, yeah?

148
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,935
It has to do with

149
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:17,478
Nick Chapel.

150
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:19,657
If you're a reporter,
my answer is no.

151
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:22,127
Thanks, but no thanks.
And also, no.

152
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,453
- I'm not. I saw you at the funeral.
- You saw me at the funeral?

153
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,488
Fighting with his mother. That
was awful the way she slapped you.

154
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:31,080
- You are a reporter.
- No, I'm a flight attendant.

155
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:35,144
- Print whatever lie you like.
- It's not like that. I killed him.

156
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:36,775
What did you say?

157
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:39,761
Not on purpose, obviously.
I'm not a murderer...

158
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,712
"Ess," murderess.

159
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,329
I've never killed
anything in my life.

160
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,313
But if it wasn't for me,
Nick wouldn't be dead.

161
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:49,225
Did Father McKinley
send you?

162
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:51,696
Because he doesn't own
the community center.

163
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,826
My class is just as legal
as his Bible study is.

164
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,425
I don't know who that is.

165
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:58,701
- Have a drink with me?
- I don't know you.

166
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,356
Not yet. I can tell
we're gonna get along great.

167
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:04,754
Just one harmless
little drink, please?

168
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:08,272
One is my limit anyway.

169
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,568
You heard about the briefcase
Nick was carrying

170
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:18,100
with the lyrics
for the new record?

171
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,878
I heard it went missing. Someone
stole it from the airport?

172
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,988
- Yes, well...
- You stole it?

173
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:24,718
Shh!

174
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,346
- Why?
- For you.

175
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,885
- For me?
- And for him too, I suppose.

176
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:34,197
God rest his soul.
See, all the songs are about you.

177
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:36,141
How can you be sure?

178
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,014
Well, one is called
"Elektra Is Blue."

179
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:42,997
Another is called
"Luxx Super Deluxe."

180
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,745
There's also one called
"All Natural Sex Vixen."

181
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:49,582
One's called "Emotional Quicksand
With Her Ankles Behind Her Ears."

182
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:54,453
And there's a working title
"He's So Juvenile, She's So Adult."

183
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:58,804
Nobody's ever written a song
about me before.

184
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:00,849
Well, this guy wrote 15.

185
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:02,445
Can I see them?

186
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,372
You can have them.

187
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:11,800
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

188
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,857
This is so generous of you.

189
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,667
You committed a crime because
you thought it was unfair

190
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:27,576
for me to never know these existed?
I couldn't live with myself knowing.

191
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:30,226
- How can I ever pay you back?
- Don't be silly.

192
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:35,763
No, I mean it. I mean, if there
is anything you ever need...

193
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:38,999
Well, there is one thing.

194
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,767
Name it.

195
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,602
- I need you to seduce my fiancé.
- Excuse me?

196
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:50,641
It's the only way I can
forgive myself and marry him.

197
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,859
I see.

198
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,441
You thought I would just
go ahead and do this?

199
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:57,592
Well, I figured with
your line of work,

200
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:59,730
...you wouldn't mind.
- I wouldn't mind?

201
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,071
Morally speaking,
in a professional sense.

202
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:07,671
My Benjamin, he's the guy,
you know?

203
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:13,303
He's intelligent,
he's kind, he's loyal.

204
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:18,322
And I just am so insanely guilty
over cheating on him,

205
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:21,243
- I can barely look him in the eye.
- So tell him.

206
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:25,395
Why would I tell him? I didn't
even consummate anything with Nick.

207
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:28,315
He talked about you while
I was giving him a blow job.

208
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:33,563
And then he hits his head, and it's just
not the kind of thing you tell a fiancé.

209
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:40,925
Is it? Well, I mean, I know that
I will never ever do it again.

210
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,843
But how can he ever
really be sure?

211
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:46,324
In his mind, he'll always wonder if,
given the chance, would I do it again.

212
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:49,878
- So you thought if I seduced him?
- Well, just the one time.

213
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,697
I would catch you in the act,
he would feel terrible.

214
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:55,614
I would forgive him,
case closed.

215
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:58,971
I'm not even considering this,
but how do you know I'm his type?

216
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:03,771
We rented one of your videos
and I could tell he was into you.

217
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,807
You know the one where you
play the nymphomaniac twins?

218
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:10,358
I fell asleep, but when I woke up,
you ended up in bed with yourself.

219
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,634
- How did you do that anyway?
- Movie magic.

220
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:16,826
- Didn't it freak you out? I mean...
- I didn't write the thing and I'm retired.

221
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:19,131
Not to mention,
I'm a mother-to-be.

222
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,103
Oh, you can barely even tell. Not in
a million years, you look fabulous.

223
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:24,727
That was not my point.

224
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,180
I didn't mean to upset you.

225
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:33,117
This whole plan
is ridiculous.

226
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:37,145
Just forget the whole thing, okay?
I think I just needed to hear myself

227
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:41,374
say it out loud to realize how
crazy it is, but I'm fine now.

228
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,612
I'm back to my good old self.

229
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,878
Well, I should be going now.

230
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:03,899
Holly?

231
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,042
Holly?

232
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:09,438
- Elektra?
- What are you doing here?

233
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:12,954
Waiting for my girlfriend. We're
going to Mexico for the weekend.

234
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:16,897
- What happened?
- Just too many martinis.

235
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:21,892
- So I heard you quit the biz, huh?
- Yup.

236
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:26,310
- And you're teaching at a commune?
- No, I teach at a community center.

237
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:28,417
- Cooking class, right?
- No.

238
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,492
- Taxidermy?
- No.

239
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:34,492
- What is taxidermy exactly?
- Like how to stuff animals.

240
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,867
- With food?
- When they're dead.

241
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:38,492
No shit.

242
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:41,605
Look, I want you
to be completely honest.

243
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:44,865
- Am I the reason you quit?
- What are you talking about?

244
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:48,389
<i>You walked off the Cowgirls set
during our big scene, remember?</i>

245
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:49,763
That?

246
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,776
No, Holly, of course not.
Nothing to do with you.

247
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:54,791
Because my whole
oral-sex hang-up

248
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,669
was connected
to memories of my dog.

249
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:00,767
I'm pregnant.

250
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,554
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

251
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:05,831
- Is it yours?
- What?

252
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,600
- Is the father gonna be around?
- I'm gonna raise it on my own.

253
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,329
HOLLY: You are?
- Mm-hm.

254
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:14,115
That is so inspirational.

255
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:15,942
I wish you were my mom.

256
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:19,431
Not in a weird way.
I'm just... I'm so thrilled.

257
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,117
Thanks. Have fun in Mexico.

258
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,704
It's not a romantic weekend.
Just my best friend.

259
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:26,499
Okay, have a blast.

260
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,601
Have you ever had a best friend
that you wanted to be closer to?

261
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,421
- What?
- Nothing.

262
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:35,751
- I hope you don't throw up too much.
- Likewise.

263
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,200
Oh, hey.

264
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,860
I'm Bert Rodriguez, sex blogger.

265
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:49,093
Once again, you are tuned into
the frequency of the erotic,

266
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,516
the wavelength of all things carnal,
voluptuous, bawdy and epicurean.

267
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,097
Never lecherous, always ardent.

268
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:59,465
<i>I'm referring, of course,
to the world of En Pelotas Magazine.</i>

269
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:02,979
We now resume part two of
the greatest-living-porn-star series,

270
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,570
profiling the meteoric rise
and illustrious reign

271
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:09,899
of world-class professional
supernova Elektra Luxx.

272
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:12,451
We will bring you up to date
with Elektra today

273
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:14,082
and address shocking rumors

274
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:17,123
that have been sweeping
the adult film industry like wildfire.

275
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:19,433
WOMAN: Did you see it yet?
- What do you want?

276
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:22,085
- Did you see it?
- See what? I'm kind of busy here.

277
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,458
There's like 15 comments
in the comments section.

278
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:27,273
BERT: I'm in the middle of a
live stream. What are you doing?

279
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:29,064
- Check it out.
- Don't touch my laptop.

280
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,231
- I'm not gonna break it. Look.
- Give me this.

281
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,013
"Me likey the hottie
in the gallery.

282
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:38,183
Dang, I was wrong about you
being gay." Signed, Pork Grind.

283
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:39,976
I hate this creep.

284
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,770
- What gallery?
- Keep reading.

285
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:45,732
<i>"This girl is perfect. Keep these coming,
En Pelotas." Signed Trilobite.</i>

286
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:47,310
What did you do?

287
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:52,937
Olive, what is that?

288
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:55,046
You wanted original content, right?

289
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:58,031
- You broke into my site.
- Desperate times, desperate measures.

290
00:17:58,193 --> 00:17:59,817
How did you guess my password?

291
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,374
Like "Captain Marvel"
was so hard to guess?

292
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:04,432
- You had no right!
- What's the big deal?

293
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:05,738
This is totally perverted!

294
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,971
- Where did you get those panties?
- I have a ton of panties like that.

295
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:12,584
I seriously doubt you have a ton of
panties that say, "All you can eat."

296
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:14,793
- Okay, maybe not a ton.
- I'm gonna be sick.

297
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:15,944
I think I look hot.

298
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:19,148
- There's something wrong with you.
- It's no big deal.

299
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:20,458
"No big deal," she says.

300
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:24,172
Look, what I mean is you're a dear
guy, brah, but no A.F. Einstein.

301
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:27,120
You call me "brah"? I'm not
your "brather," I'm your brother.

302
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:30,545
Your blog shows potential.
You have to take it to the next level.

303
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:33,739
You have no idea
what I am trying to do here.

304
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,052
There is a philosophy.

305
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:39,307
There is a sensibility and an aesthetic
that completely escapes your vulgar...

306
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:40,491
Your articles are cool.

307
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:43,027
You won't gonna generate traffic
unless you show skin.

308
00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:46,484
That's what these weirdos read the
blog for. I was doing you a favor.

309
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:48,553
A favor. How is my little sister

310
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,693
getting half naked and posting
pictures doing me a favor?

311
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,569
You need original amateur content.
Isn't that what you told Trixie?

312
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:58,221
What business is this of yours
what I told Trixie?

313
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:01,387
Maybe you wanna see her naked.
You're a perv like your readers.

314
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:05,070
I asked Trixie about this
before we were friends,

315
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:08,500
- when she was just a checkout girl.
- Because you like her.

316
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:10,417
- She's Swedish.
- She's not Swedish.

317
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,752
- Yes, she is.
- Her family's from Orange County

318
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,379
and what if she was Swedish?

319
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,069
See? This is why we're not
gonna have this conversation.

320
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:19,693
You don't know the first thing
about anything important.

321
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:22,415
- Like what?
- If it wasn't for Swedish movies

322
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:26,325
in the 1960s, practically all movies
today would be about robots, okay?

323
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:28,493
- You're full of shit.
- You don't know history!

324
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:32,438
Eroticism is in their blood. They're
like a hotbed for modern sexual culture.

325
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,453
- You... Look it up.
- Whatever.

326
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:38,412
All I know is you need original
content, perky tits and smooth legs,

327
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:40,590
not plastic hags
with stretch marks.

328
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,267
- Plastic... Stretch... God, who are you?
- I'm gonna be a famous Internet pinup.

329
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:46,992
- Not on my blog.
- Yes. Watch me.

330
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,548
You have no idea what kind
of comments I've gotten.

331
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:53,035
- Want me to read them to you?
- Put that down. This is expensive.

332
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:01,039
Cora? Are you gonna be all right?

333
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,551
I'm just gonna take a nap and
then I'll be totally awake.

334
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:08,592
Maybe not the best idea.
I hear a lot of people drown like that.

335
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:10,937
You're funny.

336
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:14,544
And a fine, fine human
being for bringing me home.

337
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,560
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

338
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:20,470
But you better go now
before Benjamin gets here.

339
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,161
I love him so much.

340
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:25,041
I really screwed up this time.

341
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,308
I think maybe you should turn off
the water before I leave.

342
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:32,021
Good idea, so I don't have to pee.

343
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:33,880
Right.

344
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,389
Right-o, buffalo.

345
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,471
What are you looking at?

346
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:59,481
Just keep walking, keep walking.

347
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,700
Don't even think about it.

348
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,889
Elektra, so stupid.

349
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,762
MAN:
Yeah?

350
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:15,162
Hi, uh, I just walked past you
on the stairs.

351
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:17,714
- Have we met before?
MAN: I don't think so.

352
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,893
ELEKTRA:
Huh. Can you, uh?

353
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:25,878
I feel really weird talking to the door.
You mind opening up?

354
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,794
- Hey.
- Hey.

355
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:36,510
I was waiting for my Realtor.

356
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,126
I'm looking for an apartment
on another floor.

357
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:40,604
Oh, yeah?

358
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:46,493
- Can I be honest with you?
- Okay.

359
00:21:47,168 --> 00:21:50,016
I was gonna ask you if I
could come in and take a look,

360
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:52,510
you know, see if
I wanted to buy or not,

361
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:55,161
but that would be a total lie.

362
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:57,788
- Lie?
- I'm just looking for an excuse

363
00:21:57,952 --> 00:22:00,092
...to get into your place.
- Why is that?

364
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,838
- Life.
- Life?

365
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,634
Life is funny, you know.

366
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:09,143
I took one look at you and said to
myself, "Elektra, life is fleeting.

367
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:12,760
And if today is a day you wanna
be bad, why not be real bad?

368
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:16,831
With that hunk of flesh with the
muscles and the crooked smile."

369
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:22,329
- You think my smile's crooked?
- With a sort of sinister sexiness.

370
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:28,026
Don't take this the wrong way,
you're a very forward woman.

371
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:32,123
Forward and backward too,
if you catch my drift.

372
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:35,329
You just don't waste any time,
do you?

373
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:38,426
I know what I like. And when I
like it, I like it right away.

374
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:39,872
So we can keep talking here.

375
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:42,938
You can always wonder "what
if," or you can pull me inside

376
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:46,500
and do to me everything you ever
wanted to do with a woman in bed.

377
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:50,075
ELEKTRA:
Right there, right there.

378
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:55,420
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

379
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:57,247
Just like that.

380
00:22:58,373 --> 00:22:59,550
Don't come yet.

381
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:01,536
Don't come yet.

382
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:06,080
God, you know how to fuck me.

383
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:10,210
Oh, I'm gonna come.
I'm gonna come.

384
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:33,052
I'll be right back.

385
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,326
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
We're not alone.

386
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:43,553
- What are you talking about?
- There is a dead chick in the bathtub.

387
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,401
- Who is this?
- I'm Elektra, you hussy.

388
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,839
- Who the hell are you?
- No. Who is this?

389
00:23:57,832 --> 00:24:00,898
- Obviously, he's your fiancé.
- This is not my fiancé.

390
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:04,676
- Yes, he is. She's still drunk.
- I'm not her fiancé.

391
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:07,743
Yes, you are. You're both drunk.
Your name is Ben.

392
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,492
I'm sorry, sweetheart. My name
is Dellwood. Dellwood Butterworth.

393
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:14,110
And you can call me Dell.

394
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:17,444
- What is he doing in here?
- He lives here, you idiot.

395
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:22,020
- Actually I don't... I don't live here.
- So, what are you doing in here?

396
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:27,049
Well, to be honest,
I, um, broke in.

397
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:28,520
- What?
- Is this a robbery?

398
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:30,920
- I'm calling 911.
- This is not a robbery.

399
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,156
- You just said you broke in.
- And then he raped you.

400
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:34,884
DELL: Whoa! Hold up, lady. Hey. Whoa.

401
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:37,894
Now, if anything,

402
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,165
...it was the other way around.
- Excuse me?

403
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:42,087
You couldn't wait
to get my clothes off.

404
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:44,772
- You said you were Ben.
DELL: I said no such thing.

405
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,241
I am a great many things,
but a liar I am not.

406
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:50,088
Well, you better be gone
when the real Ben gets here.

407
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:53,384
- As soon as I get what I came for.
- I'd say you made out pretty well.

408
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,893
Coincidentally, you happened to
break in here today? I don't buy that.

409
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:01,284
I refuse to believe God's
sense of humor could stoop this low.

410
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:02,663
To tell you the truth,

411
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,407
I am a private detective, hired by
the band to find the missing lyrics.

412
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:08,199
- What?
DELL: For the new album.

413
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:11,911
I've been tracking your whereabouts
since the funeral.

414
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:16,294
You knew what I was doing all along
and still took advantage of me?

415
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:19,214
Let's define "advantage" here.

416
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:21,709
You are a stunning woman.

417
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:23,212
You came on to me.

418
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:26,571
You asked, please take care of you
because you were just raring to go.

419
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,223
I'm a gentleman.
And I'm only human to boot, darling.

420
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,463
- You are a scumbag.
- No, listen.

421
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:34,021
In my line of work,
certain lines get crossed.

422
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:37,039
But I didn't even know you were
in the apartment. Honest.

423
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,240
When I left you at the bar,
you were soused.

424
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:41,448
I meant to come back here
before you got home.

425
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:43,853
Not much of a detective then.

426
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:48,140
Oh. Huh. Well, I was hired to find
these and I found them, didn't I?

427
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:50,693
- Those songs are rightfully hers.
- They're not.

428
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:54,214
- You'd be in trouble if it wasn't for...
- If it wasn't for?

429
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:00,974
- Was that all for show before?
- Take a wild guess.

430
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:03,559
- All of it?
- Most of it.

431
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,308
- You liked a bit of it then, didn't you?
- Well, I am not a robot.

432
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,546
- You liked more than a bit.
- Don't push it.

433
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:12,332
Can I buy you a coffee?
I mean, it's only fair.

434
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:15,178
You know,
all those songs are about me.

435
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:19,050
You know, I've never
even listened to the band.

436
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:20,942
Mostly into bluegrass,
some electro.

437
00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:23,976
- This Nick Chapel, was he talented?
CORA: Very.

438
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:28,945
I tell you what.
I don't think anyone's gonna know

439
00:26:29,106 --> 00:26:32,555
how many of these things he wrote,
so if you have coffee with me,

440
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,178
I'll let you keep the one
you like the best.

441
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:36,363
Is that a deal?

442
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,733
I suppose it could be.

443
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,064
- You gotta shake on it.
- I think we're beyond a handshake.

444
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:46,025
So you just jump on any girl
that comes on to you?

445
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:49,483
Well, not just any.

446
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,088
Well, mostly, yeah.

447
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:54,100
I mean,
look at the way she's put together.

448
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:57,135
MAN:
Hello?

449
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,750
Hello?

450
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,193
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, honey.

451
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,941
- Ben.
- Hi.

452
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,980
Mitch. This is Beatrice.
Your fiancée was nice enough

453
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:13,526
to let us take a gander.

454
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:16,720
- Thinking of buying on the 7th floor.
- Our Realtor never showed.

455
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,992
- His car hit a train.
- Just brutal.

456
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,427
Well, look. Thanks a million.

457
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:24,177
A little out of our price range,
but we'll run the numbers.

458
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,390
- Good luck.
- Benjamin.

459
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:26,900
Mitch.

460
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:36,313
BAMBI: Hey.
- What's up?

461
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:40,055
- You were talking in your sleep.
- What did I say?

462
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,320
- "What does 10 bucks get me?"
- That's it?

463
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:45,274
Yeah, what were
you dreaming?

464
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:46,548
I don't know.

465
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:48,309
Really?

466
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:50,651
Yeah, I think...

467
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,918
I think I was back at school
in the cafeteria

468
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:56,566
and I wanted to know
what 10 bucks got me.

469
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,589
So, what did you get?

470
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:02,263
- Frozen yogurt.
- No shit. You were humping the pillow.

471
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:05,019
And a pony.
Frozen yogurt and a pony.

472
00:29:06,302 --> 00:29:10,295
Well, listen up, pony girl. I just met
two venture capitalists in the lobby.

473
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:12,635
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm. Loaded.

474
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,311
- Margaritas?
- No, like, rich.

475
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:20,440
They saw us at the beach this
morning and they are totally smitten.

476
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,995
They were mosquitoes.
I got bit right on my ass.

477
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,280
"Smitten."

478
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:26,389
You need to have your ears
looked at.

479
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,804
I love my ears.

480
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,015
By a doctor.

481
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,856
Doctors are like mimes,
but they talk.

482
00:29:33,024 --> 00:29:34,431
BAMBI:
They wanna take us to dinner.

483
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,535
How can you be hungry
after that guacamole?

484
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:38,133
BAMBI:
You don't have to eat it all.

485
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:42,135
The point is, they gave me 200
bucks to go to the bathroom.

486
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:46,363
- Gross.
- Not to watch me go to the bathroom.

487
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:49,823
Just like a tip to powder my nose

488
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:52,474
prove a little interest
in our company.

489
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,397
- What company?
- Our company.

490
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,862
- We don't have a company.
- Female company.

491
00:29:57,025 --> 00:29:58,619
Okay, no need to get upset.

492
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:01,470
Well, get dressed so that
we can make some easy money.

493
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,456
Aren't we supposed to be
on vacation?

494
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:06,651
Yes, this way, we get all expenses paid.

495
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:09,754
- Okay, but isn't that, like, working?
- Technically.

496
00:30:09,922 --> 00:30:13,718
And again, who's been whining all
month about being fired from her job?

497
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,859
- I don't know.
- That was a rhetorical question.

498
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:19,993
- Are you saying I got fired?
- You told me you got fired.

499
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:22,334
I told you I got escorted
from the premises.

500
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:24,735
- I quit before they kicked me out.
- Whatever.

501
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,835
The producers said that I was never
gonna work in that town again.

502
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:29,052
It's a cheesy line.

503
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:32,482
He means he's gonna make sure you
never get another job in the business.

504
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:34,587
He didn't say "business,"
he said "town."

505
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:36,992
There are a million other towns
besides Chatsworth.

506
00:30:37,284 --> 00:30:39,292
Be that as it may,

507
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,362
one of the banker guys recognized
you from one of your movies.

508
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,027
- Which one?
- He didn't say.

509
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:47,492
But he said he stumbled upon
one of your movies in a hotel.

510
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:49,759
He's a liar.
I never did a movie in a hotel.

511
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:53,340
- No, he saw your movie in the hotel.
- What hotel?

512
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:56,325
- How am I supposed to know?
- It is an innocent question.

513
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:59,868
Why do you make it so goddamn
hard to have a simple conversation?

514
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:03,327
How am I making it hard?
I am just sharing my point of view.

515
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,950
Or should I go along
with every one of your opinions?

516
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,453
"Yes, Bambi, no, Bambi,
whatever you say, Bambi."

517
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:12,096
You should be grateful that I try to
bring something to our discussions.

518
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:16,157
I am, but sometimes the thing
that you could bring is silence.

519
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:27,518
Holly.

520
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:39,331
That sounded harsh. I'm sorry.

521
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:43,874
Are you pouting? Oh, I see.

522
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,181
You're bringing silence
to the discussion.

523
00:31:46,345 --> 00:31:48,353
You've proven your point. You win.

524
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:51,908
Come on. You're not gonna let me
go by myself, are you?

525
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:53,929
There's two of them.

526
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:55,812
Please?

527
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,880
Doesn't feel so good
when I'm rhetorical, does it?

528
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,368
Fine. Stay.

529
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,373
Thanks.
I forgot I'm babysitting tonight.

530
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,395
- Charlotte?
- How do you know?

531
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:34,790
I told you I've been following you.

532
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,284
Her aunt Addie is recovering
from an accident.

533
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,176
Doctor has a thing for her mother,

534
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,282
drove her home the other night.

535
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:44,387
You have no problem carrying
on a conversation all by yourself.

536
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:45,637
May I ask you something?

537
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:48,068
I get the feeling
you're gonna ask anyway.

538
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:51,303
Why didn't you try to prove Nick
Chapel was the father of your child?

539
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,411
You worried about the DNA test?

540
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:56,616
No, I didn't feel like having my
name dragged in mud all year long.

541
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,429
You don't appreciate questioning
that begins with:

542
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:02,980
"What first attracted you
to the millionaire Nick Chapel?"

543
00:33:03,406 --> 00:33:06,440
- Can I ask you something?
- Divorced, twice.

544
00:33:06,703 --> 00:33:08,775
Usual complaint.
I'm married to the job.

545
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:10,633
That, and I was told I suffer from

546
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,148
a quasi-quixotic desire
to set the world straight.

547
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:17,675
I started as an independent
out of Cairo, Illinois,

548
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,530
birthplace of wife number one.

549
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:21,289
I've been moving around
ever since.

550
00:33:21,455 --> 00:33:23,496
A friend roadied
for some Scottish metal act.

551
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:25,419
I fell in the rock 'n' roll crowd.

552
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,437
I get asked to do strange things,

553
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,397
including forging birth certificates
for underage groupies after the fact.

554
00:33:33,103 --> 00:33:34,991
A sort of creepy request

555
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:37,835
that does little
to elevate my opinion of men.

556
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:42,540
But the hours are flexible.
There's always free beer.

557
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:46,314
In any case, I don't expect you
to absorb all this in one sitting.

558
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:48,713
- Am I making you nervous?
- Yes.

559
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:52,143
- Why? We already went to bed.
- Well, for starters,

560
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:56,167
...you're just about perfect, darling.
- Only almost.

561
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:59,208
- And I have very good taste.
- I don't like people with taste.

562
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:02,094
Girl after my own heart.
I only meant good taste in women.

563
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,123
- Well, in that case...
- Secondly, you teach a class.

564
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,974
And I've always been terribly
intimidated by teachers.

565
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,862
Particularly sexology teachers.

566
00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:12,968
Is that even a word, "sexology"?

567
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:16,042
Oh, yeah. There's a word
for everything these days.

568
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:21,770
You teach a course
on how to act like a porn star in bed.

569
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:24,175
- That's a great title by the way.
- Thank you.

570
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:27,089
- How'd you come up with it?
- Came to me in the shower,

571
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:31,279
which is where most of my ideas
come from, which is why I'm so clean.

572
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:36,296
- You just made that up, didn't you?
- I do like the resonance of it though.

573
00:34:36,468 --> 00:34:37,995
You know what I mean?

574
00:34:38,165 --> 00:34:41,480
I've always liked people who can
describe the world in their own way.

575
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:43,987
Well, now you're just
blowing smoke up my ass.

576
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,247
An expression I never
understood entirely or wanted to.

577
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:51,891
- Still, can we do this again sometime?
- The coffee part or the other part?

578
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:55,121
- Let's start with the coffee.
- I don't know, you talk a lot.

579
00:34:55,285 --> 00:34:58,285
I don't have to.
I can just sit here and not say a word.

580
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:02,281
- I thought you said you didn't lie.
- Too late to choose the other part?

581
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:05,301
I'll see you around.

582
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:08,879
Oh, what about the song?
I told you, you could pick one.

583
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:10,541
Right.

584
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:20,785
I'll take this one.

585
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:25,047
Thank you, Dellwood.

586
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:27,445
Good luck to you.

587
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,348
As I said, Miss Luxx, call me Dell.

588
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:45,554
Just leave me alone!

589
00:35:45,786 --> 00:35:49,779
Eleanor. Goddamn it, wait.
Don't take the keys.

590
00:36:01,497 --> 00:36:03,387
Why does she always
have to be so dramatic?

591
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,588
I'm sorry.

592
00:36:05,755 --> 00:36:08,089
Nothing I ain't seen before.

593
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:12,730
- I'm Jimmy.
- I know.

594
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,820
- Has she said something about me?
- I've heard her crying.

595
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:24,856
What is it with me and elevators?

596
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,540
Power has been going
on and off all day.

597
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:31,643
- You've heard her crying?
- I'm right above you guys.

598
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,540
She's been talking amazing
amounts of shit behind my back.

599
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:40,183
But she's the one cheating on me,
you know, with her mother's gardener.

600
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:44,348
Would I make that up?
It sounds like a bad porno.

601
00:36:45,182 --> 00:36:48,084
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

602
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,165
No apology necessary.

603
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,722
I've never seen your work,
but I pass no judgment.

604
00:36:52,892 --> 00:36:54,999
I can't believe this.

605
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:00,956
This is kind of like
a bad porno too, you know.

606
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,342
You know, like, a naked guy stuck
in an elevator with a chick who,

607
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:09,941
no offense,
is hot as balls.

608
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:17,304
- Things could be worse.
- Sure.

609
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:20,189
It could be a naked guy
who talks a lot.

610
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,287
I'm sorry. I...

611
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:30,720
I'm just having a...

612
00:37:31,424 --> 00:37:34,075
That was so rude. You're...

613
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:36,123
You're sweet.

614
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:39,003
I followed her out to her
mom's estate a few weeks back.

615
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,202
I'm not proud of it,
but I get jealous.

616
00:37:42,562 --> 00:37:45,758
Her mom's loaded
and they fight all day long.

617
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:48,220
You should have seen Eleanor,

618
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:52,214
strutting past these gardeners
like she has a bell for an ass.

619
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:57,247
Puts these guys in a trance. Leaves
blowing all over the driveway.

620
00:37:58,146 --> 00:38:00,317
It's a sickness
with that girl.

621
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,583
The second I saw her,

622
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:06,968
she just knocked the
architecture right out of my legs.

623
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,271
- Love.
- Love.

624
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:13,630
When we're not in love, we're
miserable wishing we were in love.

625
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:17,111
And when we are in love, we're
miserable that love isn't enough.

626
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:18,392
You said it.

627
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,931
It's not like
we don't have enough information.

628
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:24,131
Every song and book and movie
out there is about love.

629
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:27,842
Still, it fucks up
just about everybody.

630
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:32,193
You don't have a sister by chance?

631
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,581
I do, actually.

632
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,745
- Cute?
- Twin, identical.

633
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:41,627
No kidding.
Like in that movie you did?

634
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:45,338
How would you know?
You've never seen my work.

635
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,702
That's okay.

636
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,942
I was a little offended.

637
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:53,665
So, what does she do?

638
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,590
She's a criminal.

639
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:58,336
<i>The irony is she never got caught
doing anything when we were kids.</i>

640
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:01,537
<i>I was always grounded, mostly
for chasing the neighbor's chickens</i>

641
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:02,879
<i>till they passed out.</i>

642
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,055
You look like crap.

643
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:07,942
How are you holding up?

644
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,427
I wanted to bring you a book,
but they wouldn't let me,

645
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:13,829
so I brought plain old cash.

646
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:17,634
They don't allow books.

647
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,510
You can dip a page in acid, sell off
little squares for a bunch of money.

648
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:25,765
I keep trying your lawyer. He never
calls me back. Is he doing anything?

649
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,281
He's a goofball. He says they'll
move me, and that's a good thing.

650
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:31,619
- What about the appeal?
- Tell me about Hollywood.

651
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:33,988
Is it decadent and wonderful?

652
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:35,975
I don't really know.
I work in the Valley.

653
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:38,342
But there's an endless supply
of empty warehouses.

654
00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:40,677
You're getting
more and more famous.

655
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:43,111
- Yeah, I guess.
- Don't be so modest.

656
00:39:43,274 --> 00:39:46,090
Staff members started
taking my picture while I shower.

657
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:48,963
- They can do that?
- They do whatever they want.

658
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,008
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I don't mind so much.

659
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:55,237
They just sort of stand there,
stare, drool and leave.

660
00:39:55,402 --> 00:39:57,225
You're not spending it
all up your nose?

661
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:58,662
No.

662
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:03,265
Look at me.
Trying to be a good example.

663
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,567
- You eating?
- Yeah. You?

664
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:09,637
Get up every morning at 5:30
for breakfast.

665
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:13,382
It's either pancakes with no syrup,
French toast with no syrup,

666
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,849
three kinds of eggs,
or shit on a shingle.

667
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:18,151
That's chipped beef and gravy
on toast.

668
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,909
We got lima beans
three times a day.

669
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:22,530
The Honor Ranch planted
a bumper crop of lima beans,

670
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:24,936
so we got them
coming out of our ears.

671
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:28,258
Lima-bean stew, in Jell-O,
creamed lima beans.

672
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,673
Jesus H.

673
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,449
You got a big following
with the Mexican girls.

674
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:37,159
They even asked me to make a movie
in here, but I turned them down.

675
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:39,235
- Did they try anything?
- They tried.

676
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:40,867
I had a couple of them.

677
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:45,827
The lisp is a bit of a magnet.
It gets worse when I get nervous.

678
00:40:45,998 --> 00:40:48,071
- You can barely hear it.
- It's okay.

679
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,856
The cost of doing business
around here.

680
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:58,090
- Celia.
- They put me in the quiet room.

681
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:01,603
Eight days one time,
12 days the next time.

682
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,802
No matter who you think you are,
you never get used to that.

683
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,341
I gotta get you out of here.

684
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:10,602
Don't kid yourself. I'm not getting
out of here for a couple of years.

685
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,839
But when I do,
I am never coming back.

686
00:41:13,008 --> 00:41:15,758
I'm moving to some beach somewhere
away from all the assholes.

687
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:18,413
I wanna drink myself silly,
eat shrimp cocktail

688
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:20,486
and get my nipples tanned
in the breeze.

689
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,068
- Oh, you hear about the old man?
- No.

690
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:35,982
Mom wrote saying the cocksucker
died last Christmas.

691
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:37,192
Heart attack.

692
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,678
Might've made it, but the ambulance
taking him to the hospital

693
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:44,165
ran a red light, got plowed
by a truck, finished him right off.

694
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:47,818
Like someone up there wanted
to make sure the job was done.

695
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:49,710
Celia.

696
00:41:51,537 --> 00:41:52,553
Good riddance, huh?

697
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,801
Yeah.

698
00:42:06,613 --> 00:42:08,269
Wasn't so bad.

699
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:11,666
So she ever get out?

700
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:16,272
Three years ago. Haven't
heard from her since.

701
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,205
Oh, hey, this is yours.

702
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,641
You can use my phone.
Call the locksmith.

703
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:28,117
Yeah, well, it's already
been like 30 minutes and...

704
00:42:29,461 --> 00:42:31,371
Okay, I see.

705
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,134
Yeah, will do.

706
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:34,796
Thank you.

707
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:09,807
Mm-mm.

708
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:17,779
Can I ask you something?

709
00:43:17,944 --> 00:43:20,245
You can ask.

710
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:24,748
What if I showed you
what a good neighbor I can be?

711
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:27,252
Then you should go.

712
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:29,271
What if I refuse?

713
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:32,467
I have a gun under my bed.

714
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,472
Prove it.

715
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:44,308
Go home to your wife, slick.

716
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:50,325
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- I know.

717
00:43:50,682 --> 00:43:53,300
And please leave the robe.

718
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:02,456
- Can I ask you something else?
- You can ask.

719
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:07,890
When you look at Eleanor, does she
strike you as the cheating type?

720
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:11,418
No.

721
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:16,693
You think maybe I'm just imagining
all this stuff with the gardener?

722
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:20,409
I hope so.

723
00:45:10,784 --> 00:45:11,831
What is this?

724
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,816
- What are you doing? No.
- Just let me finish this song.

725
00:45:14,976 --> 00:45:17,562
- No.
- Olive, Olive.

726
00:45:18,144 --> 00:45:19,387
- No.
- Back off!

727
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:21,855
- I'm fulfilling my manifest destiny.
- Back off!

728
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:23,806
OLIVE:
No! Get off!

729
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:31,580
MICHAEL:
To the good life.

730
00:45:31,746 --> 00:45:33,534
GEORGE: Yeah.
BAMBI: Thank you.

731
00:45:35,617 --> 00:45:38,489
- You made it.
- Please, come sit.

732
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:42,585
- How are you feeling?
- Much better. Thank you.

733
00:45:42,753 --> 00:45:44,281
I am Michael Ortiz.

734
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,785
- I'm George.
- Holly.

735
00:45:47,362 --> 00:45:50,296
You know,
you're a lot taller in person.

736
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:52,539
And you must be
the adventure capitalists.

737
00:45:52,705 --> 00:45:55,390
Now, how is that different
from regular capitalists?

738
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:57,857
- That's very clever.
- You are funny.

739
00:45:58,018 --> 00:46:00,507
- She's funny.
- I'm funny.

740
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,296
MICHAEL: Would you like
something to eat or drink?

741
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,625
- Oh, yeah, let's take a look.
- All right.

742
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:10,172
- I didn't know you wore glasses.
- I'm blind as a bat.

743
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,340
I have a water retention problem
around my ankles. Ever get that?

744
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:16,990
It feels like there's an alien
under your skin. It's not intestinal.

745
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:19,678
Did Bambi tell you
what she's been going through?

746
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:22,049
- Is your stomach bothering you?
- I'm feeling fine.

747
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,220
She was up all night
with Montalban's revenge.

748
00:46:24,388 --> 00:46:25,699
MICHAEL:
You mean Montezuma's?

749
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,195
<i>After that actor from
Fantasy Island, right?</i>

750
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,592
She's making another joke.

751
00:46:30,758 --> 00:46:33,123
It's all these beans
these Mexicans serve.

752
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:35,260
Thank God I don't have
a problem with gas.

753
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,667
Bring me beans and beer,
everybody steer clear.

754
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,772
- Holly.
- Yes?

755
00:46:39,943 --> 00:46:41,404
Come with me to the ladies' room.

756
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:43,646
- I don't have to go.
- Keep me company.

757
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:44,894
I just got here.

758
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:48,356
Did Bambi tell you about her
grandmother Lupita yet?

759
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,907
- No.
- I don't think they wanna hear this.

760
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,159
Why not?

761
00:46:52,328 --> 00:46:54,782
You go take a piss
and I'll tell them the story.

762
00:46:54,952 --> 00:46:59,142
Do you know that Bambi's real name
is Bambola de la Concepcion Paradis?

763
00:46:59,303 --> 00:47:00,285
It is not.

764
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:02,911
- You're of Spanish descent?
- Half Spanish.

765
00:47:06,472 --> 00:47:08,578
Just the really
filthy words like that.

766
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:12,607
<i>Yeah, the only Spanish that I know is
mas cerveza and grande frijol.</i>

767
00:47:12,777 --> 00:47:14,751
"Big bean," it means.
Do you know that?

768
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:16,578
Don't look like you have a big bean.

769
00:47:16,744 --> 00:47:19,078
- Holly.
- There's only one way to find out.

770
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,859
Anyway, Bambi's grandmother
was a total babe

771
00:47:22,024 --> 00:47:24,098
in the South African nation of, um...

772
00:47:25,032 --> 00:47:26,659
- What was it again?
- South America.

773
00:47:26,825 --> 00:47:29,094
- Yeah, where was she from?
- Venezuela.

774
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,232
She won Miss Venezuela
like two or three times

775
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:34,335
and caught the eye of a general.

776
00:47:34,506 --> 00:47:38,402
And these Hispanics are constantly,
I don't know, changing dictators

777
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:40,806
and overthrowing
governments and...

778
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:44,036
I don't know why I'm telling you.
You guys are both from "Hispain."

779
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:46,952
So anyway, this general had
a real hard-on for Lupita,

780
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,260
<i>a young poet's wife.</i>

781
00:47:48,427 --> 00:47:51,044
<i>He sent her elaborate gifts,
which she returned</i>

782
00:47:51,211 --> 00:47:54,473
<i>until finally, he had her husband
arrested on fake charges</i>

783
00:47:54,635 --> 00:47:56,969
<i>and then she made an appointment
to see him.</i>

784
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:04,521
<i>He made her wait all day
before she was let into his office.</i>

785
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:13,222
Your husband is a fool. It's none of
my business if you live with a fool,

786
00:48:13,388 --> 00:48:16,203
but if you wanna see him,
you'll bend to my wishes

787
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:19,015
...like the precious flower you are.
- You can't do this.

788
00:48:19,182 --> 00:48:22,531
Your husband will rot in that prison
until you give yourself to me.

789
00:48:22,702 --> 00:48:23,879
That will never happen.

790
00:48:24,045 --> 00:48:25,473
Your words, not mine.

791
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:29,190
<i>Exactly one month passed
with no word from her husband</i>

792
00:48:29,356 --> 00:48:32,074
<i>when her brother was dragged
from his classroom</i>

793
00:48:32,237 --> 00:48:33,994
<i>by the general's secret police.</i>

794
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:37,987
<i>The newspaper said he was part
of a conspiracy to kill the dictator.</i>

795
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:45,066
You're tougher than your brother.
We broke him in half a day.

796
00:48:45,231 --> 00:48:48,329
You could help him if you wanted to,
if you weren't so proud.

797
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,500
I think maybe you like this.

798
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:53,964
Maybe you've never been
touched by a real man.

799
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:57,194
Don't you wanna know what a night
of passion with a real man can do?

800
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,735
To tell you the truth,
I'm not even mildly curious.

801
00:49:03,312 --> 00:49:06,158
I am the most
patient person I know, Lupita.

802
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,591
You ever read the Bible?

803
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,617
Listen to this.

804
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:13,995
"I am the door.

805
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:18,983
By me, if any man enter in,
he shall be saved."

806
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:20,358
That's St. John.

807
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:23,753
You can be like St. John
and be that door for me, Lupita.

808
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,677
Let me enter you.

809
00:49:26,482 --> 00:49:28,106
Let me be saved by you.

810
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:32,561
<i>It took another six weeks
and the arrest of her father</i>

811
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:34,281
<i>for Lupita to finally break.</i>

812
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:37,321
<i>She agreed to see the general
and do anything he asked her</i>

813
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,912
<i>as long as her family was spared.</i>

814
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:44,938
I may not be the most honorable
man, but I keep my promises.

815
00:49:45,555 --> 00:49:48,337
You will go to hell for this,
you know that.

816
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:52,558
I'm sure the sky will fall, snakes
and spiders raining on people.

817
00:49:53,107 --> 00:49:54,996
Maybe not like that,

818
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:58,354
but justice is coming.

819
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:01,481
We will all pay for our sins.

820
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:05,970
Till then,
we do the best that we can.

821
00:50:07,636 --> 00:50:09,775
I didn't do all this to hurt you.

822
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:14,512
I did this because I can't
help myself around you.

823
00:50:14,933 --> 00:50:18,129
It's your own fault for being
God's most perfect creature.

824
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:23,054
My mother once told me:

825
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,320
"If you're going to be a whore

826
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:30,452
you might as well
be a high-priced whore."

827
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:32,753
She'd be very proud of you today.

828
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:34,347
Yes.

829
00:50:34,678 --> 00:50:36,434
Yes.

830
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,129
Because I am not a whore.

831
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:00,758
<i>And the next day,</i>

832
00:51:00,919 --> 00:51:03,954
she was arrested
and executed by a firing squad.

833
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,358
Is that true?

834
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:07,985
That is the true story
of Bambi's grandmother Lupita.

835
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:11,600
- Well, she's a real firecracker, huh?
- Yes.

836
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:15,313
I have to run to the little girls' room
because I'm bleeding like a stuck pig.

837
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:16,911
Be back.

838
00:53:03,936 --> 00:53:05,342
Ticktock.

839
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:11,707
Yeah?

840
00:54:12,421 --> 00:54:14,046
It's me.

841
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,438
Benjamin who?

842
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:19,612
Benjamin, my fiancé.
He's coming up.

843
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,538
- Who is this?
- Cora.

844
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:22,683
Where are you?

845
00:54:22,854 --> 00:54:25,504
Downstairs in the car.
He said to wait for him here.

846
00:54:25,669 --> 00:54:27,131
How did you find me?

847
00:54:27,302 --> 00:54:29,724
Father McKinley, but there's no time.
Listen up.

848
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:33,023
<i>- Wait. There's someone at my door.
- It's Benjamin.</i>

849
00:54:33,191 --> 00:54:36,125
He recognized you from the video,
so he asked me how I knew you,

850
00:54:36,295 --> 00:54:39,294
and I decided to come clean
about the Nick Chapel incident.

851
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:43,780
It went wrong and somehow I told him
that you slipped me some Quaaludes.

852
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:45,088
What?

853
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:46,685
And you and the detective
are blackmailing me.

854
00:54:46,855 --> 00:54:47,935
You what?

855
00:54:48,102 --> 00:54:50,852
It was stupid but just go along
with it. He's mad as a hornet.

856
00:54:51,016 --> 00:54:52,575
So you brought him to my place?

857
00:54:52,743 --> 00:54:55,843
He's a mild-mannered man.
He's a birdwatcher for fuck's sake.

858
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:59,782
<i>He recognized you. Your eye color
is a match for the Green-cheeked Conure.</i>

859
00:54:59,943 --> 00:55:02,879
- The what?
- It's a type of parrot. Go along with it.

860
00:55:03,048 --> 00:55:04,030
<i>I am begging you.</i>

861
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,103
I will do anything you want me to
for the rest of my life.

862
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:10,302
You name it, I'll do it.
I'm begging you.

863
00:55:11,592 --> 00:55:14,724
Miss Luxx,
do I look like a jerk to you?

864
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:19,687
Let me rephrase that.
Miss Luxx, I am not a jerk.

865
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,238
Under different circumstances,
you'd see right away.

866
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,312
I'm one of the least
jerk-type guys around.

867
00:55:25,482 --> 00:55:28,777
And I figure you've met your share.
Am I right or am I out of line?

868
00:55:28,937 --> 00:55:32,288
In the world that you've chosen
to sell your wares,

869
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:36,802
to apply your talents, to
present yourself as a commodity,

870
00:55:36,972 --> 00:55:38,051
a vendible,

871
00:55:38,218 --> 00:55:40,608
you've met some
not-so-nice guys.

872
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,990
Am I correct, Miss Luxx?

873
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:43,878
You can call me Elektra.

874
00:55:44,043 --> 00:55:47,305
Can I? Because I don't
really know you, now, do I?

875
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:50,464
Well, no.

876
00:55:50,636 --> 00:55:53,505
What we do know
is you're a phony.

877
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:55,622
- Excuse me?
- Is it not your job

878
00:55:55,788 --> 00:55:58,855
to fake
the most intimate emotions?

879
00:55:59,628 --> 00:56:01,057
Pleasure? Joy?

880
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:04,262
You're a phony.
Objectively speaking, yeah?

881
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,738
Among colloquials.

882
00:56:08,397 --> 00:56:11,747
And if you knew my Cora like
I know Cora, and how could you?

883
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:17,448
You can't, but if you did, you would
know that she is a life enthusiast.

884
00:56:17,613 --> 00:56:19,588
Well, I assure you that I've never...

885
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:21,613
Someone looking
to broaden her horizons.

886
00:56:22,156 --> 00:56:24,841
Moral? Yes.

887
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:27,533
Not infallible.

888
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:29,767
And here you come,

889
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:32,357
a sex-industry celebrity,

890
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:35,309
charitable with your Quaaludes
and your drummer boyfriend,

891
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:38,057
and he preyed upon the fact
that it was his song

892
00:56:38,222 --> 00:56:40,907
we listened to on our engagement
night. Did you know? No.

893
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,413
Yeah, we did.

894
00:56:42,575 --> 00:56:45,478
His famous song. His power
ballad. What's it called?

895
00:56:45,648 --> 00:56:49,062
"Set Me Free or..."

896
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:52,431
"Set Me on Fire or Set
Me Free, Silky Marie."

897
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:56,455
Yes. And you throw a lot of
sand in her eyes, don't you?

898
00:56:56,624 --> 00:56:57,934
Pixie dust.

899
00:56:58,096 --> 00:57:01,610
And suddenly, she wakes up in a
bathroom 20,000 feet in the air

900
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:04,012
with a drug casualty

901
00:57:04,656 --> 00:57:06,250
in heavy turbulence

902
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:09,067
and you have the nerve
to blackmail her.

903
00:57:12,465 --> 00:57:14,767
What kind of person are you?

904
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:33,809
Just so we're clear, you will
never get another penny from us.

905
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,272
I refuse to become your mule,

906
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:39,915
whatever it's called
in blackmailer's parlance,

907
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:43,375
in your vulgar patois.

908
00:57:46,036 --> 00:57:49,231
I've never hit a woman, but if
you start bothering my fiancée,

909
00:57:49,396 --> 00:57:52,013
I will kick your ass
something serious.

910
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:55,441
Same offer goes
for your detective bitch.

911
00:57:56,629 --> 00:57:59,150
I may look like
I have zero combat rating,

912
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:02,578
but trust me,

913
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:06,578
you don't wanna
tussle with me.

914
00:59:22,714 --> 00:59:25,529
What kind of person am I?

915
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,601
I wish I had a clue, little one.

916
00:59:57,759 --> 00:59:58,967
<i>GIRL:
I didn't say that.</i>

917
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:05,082
<i>WOMAN 1:
Girls, lunchtime.</i>

918
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:08,249
<i>You come back here.</i>

919
01:00:12,572 --> 01:00:14,233
<i>CELIA:
They put me in the quiet room.</i>

920
01:00:14,398 --> 01:00:16,885
<i>Eight days one time,
12 days the next time.</i>

921
01:00:17,054 --> 01:00:21,048
<i>No matter who you think you are,
you never get used to that.</i>

922
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:25,916
<i>GIRL:
Please don't go, Dad.</i>

923
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,395
<i>MAN 1: The rock-music world is in shock
with the news that Nick Chapel,</i>

924
01:00:29,565 --> 01:00:31,903
<i>drummer for the rock band
Midnight Love Parade,</i>

925
01:00:32,063 --> 01:00:35,129
<i>has been found dead in the lavatory
of a commercial airliner.</i>

926
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:43,191
<i>MAN 2: You're so pretty,
you could be a movie star.</i>

927
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,215
<i>WOMAN 2:
Come on, don't be scared.</i>

928
01:01:03,713 --> 01:01:06,943
- Don't be scared.
- Fuck. Shit. Oh, my God.

929
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:08,764
Hello, Elektra.

930
01:01:08,928 --> 01:01:10,555
What are you?

931
01:01:12,066 --> 01:01:14,301
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

932
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:17,313
The actual Virgin Mary?

933
01:01:17,475 --> 01:01:19,742
That whole thing
is blown out of proportion.

934
01:01:19,907 --> 01:01:21,881
Mary is fine.

935
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:23,937
I'm hallucinating, right?

936
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,138
Am I dying? Is it a tumor?

937
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:28,893
No, I'm really here.

938
01:01:29,059 --> 01:01:30,520
All right.

939
01:01:30,915 --> 01:01:34,079
I'm gonna close my eyes

940
01:01:34,243 --> 01:01:38,138
and when I open them
you won't be here.

941
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:48,090
"Snow white, sinful,
everything fits tight.

942
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:51,557
Nipples like 12-penny nails
dancing in the light."

943
01:01:52,037 --> 01:01:55,233
This doesn't strike me
as hit-single material.

944
01:01:55,907 --> 01:01:57,697
It's a first draft.
Needs a little work.

945
01:01:57,861 --> 01:02:00,162
The entire lyric
is about your breasts.

946
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,748
He wrote one
about my ankles too.

947
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:06,332
But he didn't mean it like that.
It's just his way of...

948
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:13,372
Mary,

949
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:17,310
what are you doing here?

950
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:20,226
You're not happy to see me?

951
01:02:21,094 --> 01:02:24,161
Oh, I am. Just...

952
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:27,939
I never imagined I'd
actually be talking to you.

953
01:02:28,103 --> 01:02:31,681
Well, sure you did.
You used to talk to me every night.

954
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,268
- I did?
- "Dear Mary, Mother of Sorrows,

955
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:38,117
does anyone hide as many deep
secrets as I hide inside?"

956
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,489
And you were listening?

957
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:42,592
I'm here, aren't I?

958
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,100
Hm.

959
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:52,385
Dear Mary, Mother of Sorrows,

960
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:58,176
I've had kind of a tough day,
week, year.

961
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,469
I'm sorry to burden you
with my problems.

962
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:04,455
I'm sure you have more
important people...

963
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:06,790
Don't. People always do
that. They ask for help

964
01:03:06,953 --> 01:03:09,473
and then say there's someone
else I should be helping.

965
01:03:12,106 --> 01:03:13,895
I'm here.

966
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,097
Ask me anything you wanna know.

967
01:03:19,402 --> 01:03:21,126
- Anything?
- As long as it isn't

968
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:22,885
the capital of South Dakota.

969
01:03:28,426 --> 01:03:32,387
- Anything?
- Anything. Past, present or future.

970
01:03:32,556 --> 01:03:34,497
Just one question, please.

971
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:37,537
People tend
to abuse this privilege.

972
01:03:44,395 --> 01:03:46,786
Will my baby be healthy?

973
01:03:47,725 --> 01:03:49,480
She's perfectly healthy.

974
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,683
She?

975
01:03:51,852 --> 01:03:54,537
Strictly speaking,
I'm not supposed to do that.

976
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:58,376
Actually, I came to give you
a message.

977
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:00,963
What message?

978
01:04:01,132 --> 01:04:04,067
Something good
is going to happen to you.

979
01:04:09,677 --> 01:04:10,823
That's it?

980
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:13,062
Today. That's the important part.

981
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:14,212
Today.

982
01:04:14,382 --> 01:04:16,838
Isn't today almost over?

983
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,555
It's not over yet.

984
01:04:23,214 --> 01:04:26,826
I had such high hopes for my life
when I was little.

985
01:04:28,879 --> 01:04:32,938
I just really thought it was all
gonna turn out different, you know.

986
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:35,274
It's how you do things,

987
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:39,659
not necessarily the things you do
that make you who you are.

988
01:04:43,985 --> 01:04:45,479
What's your heart worth?

989
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,110
What?

990
01:04:48,272 --> 01:04:51,948
A person's worth what their heart
is worth. You know that, don't you?

991
01:04:53,553 --> 01:04:55,080
Don't confuse me even more.

992
01:04:55,249 --> 01:04:57,802
You're not confused.
You're just afraid.

993
01:04:57,968 --> 01:05:00,303
- I am so afraid.
- Of what?

994
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:04,681
A harmless little baby?

995
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:09,033
But what am I gonna tell her
when she grows up?

996
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:14,729
That her mom made her living
spreading her legs on camera?

997
01:05:16,306 --> 01:05:18,727
What kind of example is that?

998
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:23,568
I can just picture
the other moms sneering

999
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:27,080
and their husbands making passes,
or maybe not even.

1000
01:05:27,571 --> 01:05:29,514
Maybe the baby weight
never comes off,

1001
01:05:29,684 --> 01:05:33,874
and I'm just
some fat ex-porn star

1002
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:40,109
collecting unemployment, charging
for appearances at fan convention...

1003
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:57,581
For one generation, it was the
assassination of a beloved president.

1004
01:05:57,749 --> 01:06:00,400
For another, the killing
of a peace-loving musician.

1005
01:06:00,564 --> 01:06:04,077
For the one after that, the suicide
of yet another peace-loving musician.

1006
01:06:04,245 --> 01:06:06,798
But for my generation
and that of my peers,

1007
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:10,315
the shocking announcement
of Elektra Luxx's sudden retirement

1008
01:06:10,486 --> 01:06:13,203
from the adult-film industry
defined the end of an era.

1009
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:15,887
A loss, not of innocence,
not exactly,

1010
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,508
but a potentially
insurmountable loss, nonetheless.

1011
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:23,377
<i>I am Bert Rodriguez
from En Pelotas Magazine,</i>

1012
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:27,286
the adult Latin world's numero uno
source for breaking sexy news

1013
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:30,197
and it is my duty,
sad as it may be,

1014
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,655
to put into context
what is no longer rumor

1015
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:35,058
but ice-cold fact.

1016
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,054
For weeks we've held
our collective breath

1017
01:06:39,223 --> 01:06:44,559
and prayed that the rumor mill
was simply just milling.

1018
01:06:44,887 --> 01:06:51,030
But we must now face her
unexpected, Garboesque decision

1019
01:06:51,193 --> 01:06:53,103
to walk away from the spotlight.

1020
01:06:53,273 --> 01:06:55,573
WOMAN:
Roberto?

1021
01:06:56,665 --> 01:06:58,574
What? I'm working.

1022
01:06:58,746 --> 01:07:02,390
WOMAN:
That checkout girl is here again.

1023
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,213
Let's take a break.

1024
01:07:08,922 --> 01:07:10,647
Thanks, compadre.

1025
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,046
Trixie, with an X.

1026
01:07:17,211 --> 01:07:18,554
Yep.

1027
01:07:20,091 --> 01:07:22,230
- That Walton kid is cute.
- He's an innocent.

1028
01:07:22,394 --> 01:07:24,054
- Don't drag him into this.
- Into what?

1029
01:07:24,218 --> 01:07:28,180
Just saying he doesn't need to grow
up any faster than he already has.

1030
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:31,347
- The world has enough grown-ups.
- You're in a funky mood.

1031
01:07:31,516 --> 01:07:34,102
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
I just can't seem to shake it.

1032
01:07:34,268 --> 01:07:38,294
You know, I even went to the cemetery
to remind myself that she's not dead.

1033
01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:41,491
- And?
- Oh, it didn't help.

1034
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:43,547
I'm thinking of starting
a support group,

1035
01:07:43,707 --> 01:07:45,235
not just online but in person.

1036
01:07:45,405 --> 01:07:48,535
Like kindred spirits
going through it together.

1037
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:51,989
Let's talk about something else.

1038
01:07:52,157 --> 01:07:55,638
I would if there was anything else.

1039
01:07:56,766 --> 01:07:58,390
So you wanna see the pictures?

1040
01:07:58,556 --> 01:08:02,452
Because I'm really nervous
about showing you these.

1041
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:03,832
What pictures?

1042
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,886
I told you
I was gonna get test shots.

1043
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:07,061
Test shots?

1044
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:10,525
Yeah, to see if I had what it takes.
You know, the "it" quality that...

1045
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:12,146
Did Olive put you up to this?

1046
01:08:12,735 --> 01:08:14,329
No.

1047
01:08:15,038 --> 01:08:17,656
I've decided I wanna become
an Internet pinup.

1048
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,061
Oh, wow.

1049
01:08:20,446 --> 01:08:21,821
Okay.

1050
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,927
Well, this is a lot more eclectic
than you made it sound.

1051
01:08:33,374 --> 01:08:34,520
I look fat, don't I?

1052
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,182
No, not at all.

1053
01:08:36,352 --> 01:08:39,864
You look, very... Wow, I can
almost see your kidneys in this one.

1054
01:08:40,224 --> 01:08:42,527
Yeah, the photographer said
that's a key pose

1055
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:46,912
if you wanna make it out
of the amateur world.

1056
01:08:50,241 --> 01:08:52,063
You look
very contemplative here.

1057
01:08:52,224 --> 01:08:55,454
Yeah, it was a heck of a pose
to hold.

1058
01:08:55,713 --> 01:08:57,950
You don't think I look
a little bit like a squid?

1059
01:08:58,114 --> 01:09:00,863
No. No, not at all.

1060
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:05,436
But, Trixie, I don't know
if you should necessarily

1061
01:09:05,603 --> 01:09:08,187
be going around
and showing these to just anyone.

1062
01:09:08,354 --> 01:09:11,420
I mean, they're very personal,
for lack of a better word.

1063
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:13,146
You look beautiful.

1064
01:09:13,314 --> 01:09:14,939
It's not that. You...

1065
01:09:15,106 --> 01:09:17,114
Every part of you is...

1066
01:09:17,508 --> 01:09:21,663
It's very well-lit
and it's very well-manicured.

1067
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:23,071
Are you blushing?

1068
01:09:23,235 --> 01:09:25,406
Yeah, it just got hot in here, right?

1069
01:09:26,724 --> 01:09:28,764
Are you a little, um,
flustered?

1070
01:09:29,315 --> 01:09:31,388
"Flustered." No. I'm...

1071
01:09:31,555 --> 01:09:34,589
Just feel a little strange,
don't you?

1072
01:09:35,044 --> 01:09:37,980
Just a little clammy maybe.

1073
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:39,610
The a.c. hasn't been working

1074
01:09:39,781 --> 01:09:42,649
and, um, this whole
Elektra Luxx thing

1075
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:45,887
has really hit me harder
than I've let on.

1076
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,665
Can we not talk about Elektra
for a second?

1077
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:52,448
Look at me.

1078
01:09:54,405 --> 01:09:57,984
I'm real and I'm here.

1079
01:09:58,276 --> 01:10:00,034
Yeah, I know. I'm not that out of it.

1080
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,077
Here.

1081
01:10:07,173 --> 01:10:09,629
- Feel my heart.
- Very strong.

1082
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,998
Beats all the way from here

1083
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,438
to here.

1084
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:19,073
So it does.

1085
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:21,572
Oh, God.

1086
01:10:21,959 --> 01:10:26,269
Can't you see, Bert Rodriguez,
you ridiculous man?

1087
01:10:26,568 --> 01:10:27,777
I have zero interest

1088
01:10:27,944 --> 01:10:30,465
...in becoming an Internet pinup.
- You don't?

1089
01:10:30,632 --> 01:10:33,186
The only reason I come down here
is so that I can see you.

1090
01:10:33,352 --> 01:10:34,595
That's silly.

1091
01:10:38,857 --> 01:10:40,351
Trixie.

1092
01:10:40,521 --> 01:10:41,982
Yeah.

1093
01:10:42,602 --> 01:10:44,837
- No.
- Yeah.

1094
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,848
But you said you never had
a best guy friend before

1095
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:53,638
...and that meant a lot to you.
- Well, what can I say?

1096
01:10:54,248 --> 01:10:56,453
- But what about these pictures?
- They're for you.

1097
01:10:56,617 --> 01:10:59,140
For me? So you went
to some weirdo photographer,

1098
01:10:59,306 --> 01:11:02,469
some '70s throwback who
specializes in nude figure modeling

1099
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,292
to take pictures just to show me?

1100
01:11:04,586 --> 01:11:07,652
No, actually, Olive took them.

1101
01:11:07,818 --> 01:11:10,786
- Olive? Bane-of-my-existence Olive?
- Yes.

1102
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:12,548
I'm feeling a little fuzzy.

1103
01:11:12,714 --> 01:11:15,563
Oh-oh. No. You're not gonna
faint before you kiss me.

1104
01:11:15,724 --> 01:11:17,828
I'm not planning on fainting at all.

1105
01:11:17,995 --> 01:11:22,403
I'm just saying that I'm feeling
a little woozy because

1106
01:11:23,595 --> 01:11:25,253
I haven't eaten...

1107
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,366
Bert? Bert?

1108
01:11:28,779 --> 01:11:31,649
Oh, fuck.

1109
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:39,108
Well...

1110
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:43,786
Well, you never know where
things will take you, do you?

1111
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:46,698
I listen to your voice every day, Bert.

1112
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:50,754
I recorded one of your goofy
streaming chats and edited it

1113
01:11:50,925 --> 01:11:54,373
so that instead of talking
about different pubic hairstyles

1114
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:57,388
worn by porn stars, it says:

1115
01:11:58,061 --> 01:12:03,845
"You're an uncontaminated blossom
in a wilderness of evil."

1116
01:12:05,134 --> 01:12:07,436
Don't ask me what it means.

1117
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,626
All I can say is that every morning,

1118
01:12:10,797 --> 01:12:14,573
I wake up to that voice
like Pavlov's dog.

1119
01:12:15,054 --> 01:12:20,239
A voice my clit recognizes instantly.

1120
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,877
You tantalize me, Bert Rodriguez.

1121
01:12:25,617 --> 01:12:29,359
I wanna swallow you whole
and spit out the bones.

1122
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:43,143
Do you wanna tell me what
the hell it is you think you're doing?

1123
01:12:43,313 --> 01:12:45,221
Going with the flow?
Being funny?

1124
01:12:45,393 --> 01:12:47,946
The idea is to show
these guys a good time.

1125
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,896
- You mean your idea.
- Yes, Holly, my idea.

1126
01:12:51,057 --> 01:12:53,196
Seeing as your idea
is some bizarre attempt

1127
01:12:53,361 --> 01:12:56,395
at teaching these guys a lesson
in morals, I say go with mine.

1128
01:12:56,562 --> 01:12:58,384
And who made you boss?
Was there a vote?

1129
01:12:58,547 --> 01:13:01,361
- What is with you?
- I was gonna ask the same question.

1130
01:13:01,522 --> 01:13:03,530
What am I doing? Trying
to make us some money.

1131
01:13:03,699 --> 01:13:05,455
- Pimping me out.
- Pimping us both out.

1132
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:07,441
Seeing as that's what
we do for a living.

1133
01:13:07,602 --> 01:13:09,992
- There's more to it than the money.
- Like what?

1134
01:13:10,164 --> 01:13:13,011
Maybe you've been getting pawed at
by pigs for so long

1135
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:15,473
that you're actually starting
to like it.

1136
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:18,641
Rest assured it's all an act.

1137
01:13:18,803 --> 01:13:20,113
Well, that's what you say.

1138
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:23,536
- Who else is gonna say it?
- Now you're just trying to confuse me.

1139
01:13:23,827 --> 01:13:26,644
Because you know it's an act.
You're trying to hurt my feelings.

1140
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:28,462
How do I know that?

1141
01:13:28,628 --> 01:13:29,904
How do you know that?

1142
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:32,659
Because you know me better
than anybody, Holly.

1143
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:33,933
You're my best friend.

1144
01:13:34,101 --> 01:13:36,467
- Am I?
- What is that supposed to mean?

1145
01:13:36,628 --> 01:13:39,150
Friends aren't supposed
to be embarrassed of each other.

1146
01:13:39,317 --> 01:13:41,870
- Who says I'm embarrassed?
- Nobody.

1147
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:43,728
I'm the one
who's embarrassed.

1148
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:47,984
You're embarrassed of me?
You've got a lot of nerve.

1149
01:13:48,244 --> 01:13:50,548
You can be embarrassed of me
but I can't be of you?

1150
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:53,709
- I never said I was.
- You don't have to. I can tell.

1151
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:55,600
Oh, stop it. It's not true.

1152
01:13:55,766 --> 01:13:56,942
Your word against mine.

1153
01:13:57,398 --> 01:13:59,372
Why would I
be embarrassed?

1154
01:13:59,541 --> 01:14:03,437
Because I'm not the sharpest stool
in the shed.

1155
01:14:05,078 --> 01:14:09,967
Where does it say I wanna hang out
with the sharpest tool in the shed?

1156
01:14:10,935 --> 01:14:13,270
"Tool," sorry.

1157
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:16,304
No need to apologize.

1158
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,149
So you struggle with big words.
Big deal.

1159
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,964
"Tool" is not a big word.

1160
01:14:23,128 --> 01:14:24,982
Well, it's not an everyday word.

1161
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:29,648
Unless you work
at a hardware store.

1162
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,495
Maybe I should get tested.

1163
01:14:36,825 --> 01:14:38,102
Tested for what?

1164
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,822
To see if I'm acoustic.

1165
01:14:40,216 --> 01:14:42,006
- Autistic?
- That.

1166
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:43,696
Holly, you're not autistic.

1167
01:14:43,864 --> 01:14:45,359
What the hell is wrong with me?

1168
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:47,831
I never understand
what anybody's talking about.

1169
01:14:47,994 --> 01:14:51,705
It's like the entire world got handed
an instruction manual except for me.

1170
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:57,499
I think sometimes
you're easily distracted.

1171
01:14:57,658 --> 01:14:59,032
Mostly around you.

1172
01:14:59,642 --> 01:15:01,333
What do you mean?

1173
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:04,498
- I think I'm distracted by you.
- Great. It's my fault again.

1174
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,521
Not like that.

1175
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:09,715
It's just because you're...

1176
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:15,862
You're so pretty and smart

1177
01:15:16,027 --> 01:15:21,113
and generous and funny and kind.

1178
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:24,857
Well, I'm not all that kind.

1179
01:15:25,596 --> 01:15:28,630
I know how much patience it takes
to hang around me. I do.

1180
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:34,137
I love you, Bambi.

1181
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,134
I love you too.

1182
01:15:42,398 --> 01:15:44,023
Okay.

1183
01:15:44,223 --> 01:15:47,636
What do you say
we take a deep breath,

1184
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:50,294
we go back out there
and we show these guys...

1185
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:54,902
No, not like I like you, I mean...
Which I do.

1186
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:58,809
I'm in love with you.

1187
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:02,902
I know you don't feel
the same way,

1188
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:07,032
but I couldn't go on another second
without telling you.

1189
01:16:08,094 --> 01:16:11,291
- I think you're a little drunk.
- I've never been this sober in my life.

1190
01:16:11,711 --> 01:16:13,119
Holly, we're not even gay.

1191
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:15,035
- Neither are you.
- That's my point.

1192
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:19,673
No, it's not about being
straight or gay, okay? I just...

1193
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,977
Yeah, I love you.

1194
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,729
I've never been clearer
about anything.

1195
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,957
- This is ridiculous.
- I know.

1196
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:30,745
Are you serious?

1197
01:16:32,673 --> 01:16:35,008
But I mean... I don't under...

1198
01:16:35,522 --> 01:16:38,204
I mean, this is retarded.

1199
01:16:38,368 --> 01:16:41,053
What are we supposed to do,
go out on a date?

1200
01:16:41,633 --> 01:16:42,878
Maybe.

1201
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:48,378
So you wanna
have sex with me?

1202
01:16:48,546 --> 01:16:51,862
I mean, I dream about it
almost every night.

1203
01:16:53,346 --> 01:16:56,826
Holly, you're making me blush.

1204
01:16:56,995 --> 01:16:58,304
I'm telling you the truth.

1205
01:16:58,466 --> 01:17:00,736
So the dream about the pony?

1206
01:17:00,898 --> 01:17:02,938
I'm afraid of ponies.

1207
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:08,731
But I am wet
with indecent happiness for you.

1208
01:17:10,499 --> 01:17:12,734
- Really?
- Really.

1209
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:16,190
- What about men?
- What about them?

1210
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:18,595
I'm gonna need penis
once in a while.

1211
01:17:18,754 --> 01:17:20,185
- Who doesn't?
- Who doesn't?

1212
01:17:20,357 --> 01:17:23,486
Look, I'm not saying yesterday
I'm sucking cocks like a madwoman,

1213
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:26,817
and today I forgot
about the whole thing, it's just...

1214
01:17:28,036 --> 01:17:34,017
The person that I wanna be with
night and day is you.

1215
01:17:34,661 --> 01:17:37,443
The rest will sort itself out.

1216
01:17:38,693 --> 01:17:40,416
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1217
01:17:40,581 --> 01:17:42,470
- It doesn't make sense.
- Doesn't have to.

1218
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:44,964
No, we might really regret this
in the morning.

1219
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,816
I don't care. I don't care.

1220
01:18:06,663 --> 01:18:09,630
Sorry, I couldn't wait
any longer.

1221
01:18:13,383 --> 01:18:15,358
My mother-in-law's
probably cracking jokes

1222
01:18:15,527 --> 01:18:18,375
about how it's taking
me so long in here.

1223
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,953
"Beans, beans, beans.

1224
01:18:22,121 --> 01:18:26,015
What is this country's obsession
with putting beans in everything?"

1225
01:18:27,593 --> 01:18:29,087
- Howdy, partner.
- Hey.

1226
01:18:29,258 --> 01:18:30,817
Where's your mom?

1227
01:18:30,985 --> 01:18:33,440
She dropped me off.
She was late for a date.

1228
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:36,805
- By the way, your elevator is broken.
- Still?

1229
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:41,604
How was your day?

1230
01:18:41,834 --> 01:18:44,736
Disaster. You?

1231
01:18:44,906 --> 01:18:46,400
Same.

1232
01:18:47,018 --> 01:18:48,675
What happened?

1233
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:54,531
Just perfected a skill for
pissing everybody off these days.

1234
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:57,545
A skill is a skill. Don't knock it.

1235
01:18:58,154 --> 01:19:00,424
- Smoke?
- I thought you quit?

1236
01:19:00,587 --> 01:19:02,857
Another resolution I couldn't keep.

1237
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:12,356
Thank you.

1238
01:19:15,788 --> 01:19:16,901
I tracked down my dad.

1239
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:21,034
He's in Arizona State serving
a nickel stretch on a robbery charge.

1240
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:22,571
Are you gonna visit him?

1241
01:19:22,732 --> 01:19:25,317
I'm gonna start with a letter,
go from there.

1242
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:28,044
Yeah, that's a sensible thing to do.

1243
01:19:28,236 --> 01:19:31,913
Fathers are way complicated.

1244
01:19:35,245 --> 01:19:36,708
Can I ask you something?

1245
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:38,404
Anything.

1246
01:19:39,181 --> 01:19:43,524
If you only retain 23 percent of what
you learn in high school, what's it for?

1247
01:19:43,694 --> 01:19:46,759
It's like a test run for life.
You know, how to deal with people.

1248
01:19:46,926 --> 01:19:48,682
- Mean people.
- Mostly mean people.

1249
01:19:48,847 --> 01:19:52,873
- Were you popular in high school?
- I was a total misfit till I was a senior,

1250
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,405
...then I got a little too popular.
- What changed?

1251
01:19:56,111 --> 01:19:57,354
I was a late developer.

1252
01:19:57,518 --> 01:19:58,763
Intellectually speaking.

1253
01:19:59,631 --> 01:20:01,803
You are a riot.

1254
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:06,603
Look, I know you've
heard this before,

1255
01:20:07,695 --> 01:20:09,931
but if you peak in high school,
you're done.

1256
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:13,444
The less you fit in now, the better
chance you have at a happy life.

1257
01:20:15,055 --> 01:20:17,325
What was your day disaster?

1258
01:20:18,032 --> 01:20:21,032
- Totally child inappropriate.
- Sex, drugs, murder?

1259
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:23,404
- No drugs involved.
- Jesus!

1260
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:25,869
Are the cops gonna come
busting in any second?

1261
01:20:28,785 --> 01:20:29,994
That's freaky.

1262
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:34,539
Probably your mom
forgot something.

1263
01:20:38,384 --> 01:20:39,367
Mrs. Turner?

1264
01:20:39,537 --> 01:20:41,425
TURNER: Do you realize
your elevator isn't working?

1265
01:20:41,585 --> 01:20:42,567
ELEKTRA:
Yes, I'm sorry.

1266
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:45,039
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
May I come in?

1267
01:20:45,682 --> 01:20:47,753
ELEKTRA: Um, of course.
- All right.

1268
01:20:47,921 --> 01:20:50,027
Charlotte, this is my friend
Mrs. Turner.

1269
01:20:51,571 --> 01:20:53,839
No. No, it isn't.

1270
01:20:54,002 --> 01:20:54,984
Charlotte.

1271
01:20:55,154 --> 01:20:58,666
This is Rebecca Linbrook.
I've read all your novels.

1272
01:20:59,059 --> 01:21:01,131
Aren't you
a little young for them?

1273
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,633
Rebecca Linbrook,
the mystery writer?

1274
01:21:03,795 --> 01:21:06,283
- That's me.
- I read one of your books.

1275
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:09,997
The one that got turned into that movie
with what's-his-name as the detective.

1276
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:12,811
Alan Rickman. The ending was
way better in the book.

1277
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:16,521
Have to agree with you there,
young lady.

1278
01:21:16,851 --> 01:21:19,755
Why did you tell me
your name was Mrs. Turner?

1279
01:21:19,924 --> 01:21:22,127
Well, uh, may I?

1280
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:23,371
Yes.

1281
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:26,356
You have to understand I haven't
done my own research for years.

1282
01:21:26,517 --> 01:21:28,753
I usually hire someone else
to do it for me.

1283
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:32,877
But there was something
intriguing about your ad.

1284
01:21:33,044 --> 01:21:35,762
The ad in the paper
about your class.

1285
01:21:36,821 --> 01:21:39,375
And I felt compelled
to check it out myself.

1286
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,454
I'm not sure I follow.

1287
01:21:41,623 --> 01:21:44,110
She's been coming to your class
posing as a student

1288
01:21:44,277 --> 01:21:46,100
to write a character based on you.

1289
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:49,012
- You have?
- In so many words.

1290
01:21:49,334 --> 01:21:51,221
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

1291
01:21:51,382 --> 01:21:52,813
Well, awful, I should think,

1292
01:21:52,983 --> 01:21:55,981
when I tell you what sort of character
I was looking for.

1293
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:57,296
What sort of character?

1294
01:21:57,591 --> 01:21:58,736
Something lurid, I bet.

1295
01:21:58,903 --> 01:22:01,685
A fallen woman.
A future murder victim, perhaps?

1296
01:22:01,846 --> 01:22:03,471
Charlotte, please.

1297
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:06,127
A desperate woman
on a downward spiral.

1298
01:22:06,295 --> 01:22:08,945
She was once
a very famous adult-film star.

1299
01:22:09,111 --> 01:22:12,724
Now she's being cast in mother roles
which, of course, her ego can't take,

1300
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:16,205
so she decides to start a class
at a community center,

1301
01:22:16,376 --> 01:22:18,286
unwittingly attracting a stalker

1302
01:22:18,457 --> 01:22:21,207
with ties to her past.
I never got cast in mother roles.

1303
01:22:21,368 --> 01:22:25,144
Maybe he's a jilted ex-boyfriend or the
deformed janitor at her old high school.

1304
01:22:25,304 --> 01:22:28,436
- She has a twin she never talks about.
- I have a twin sister.

1305
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,642
- I spoke with her.
- You spoke with my sister?

1306
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:33,839
I always wanted a twin sister.
I used to check under my bed.

1307
01:22:34,009 --> 01:22:37,457
- I didn't tell her what it was about.
- Why did you speak with my sister?

1308
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:40,723
- Like I said, character background.
- I think you better go now.

1309
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:44,884
Oh, no, no, no. There's no reason
to be scared or uncomfortable.

1310
01:22:45,049 --> 01:22:46,577
I'm telling you all of this

1311
01:22:46,745 --> 01:22:50,455
precisely because I am not writing
a character based on you anymore.

1312
01:22:50,842 --> 01:22:51,858
You're not?

1313
01:22:52,027 --> 01:22:54,164
Absolutely, categorically not.

1314
01:22:54,618 --> 01:22:55,764
What changed
your mind?

1315
01:22:55,931 --> 01:22:58,832
I needed a femme fatale.
A tragic figure.

1316
01:22:59,002 --> 01:23:02,004
And you just kept changing
my perception of the character

1317
01:23:02,172 --> 01:23:04,179
so then I became interested
in you.

1318
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:08,145
I became intrigued
with how positive you remain

1319
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,290
even having led such a sordid life.

1320
01:23:10,461 --> 01:23:12,435
It takes more than willpower.

1321
01:23:12,603 --> 01:23:15,800
It takes gusto
to remain that stubborn.

1322
01:23:16,508 --> 01:23:20,917
- I can't tell if you're making fun of me.
- I don't think she is. Look at her eyes.

1323
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:24,985
Charlotte, um, will you let us talk
in private for a moment?

1324
01:23:25,821 --> 01:23:28,242
Sure thing.
Nice meeting you, Miss Linbrook.

1325
01:23:28,413 --> 01:23:30,933
Nice meeting you too, Charlotte.

1326
01:23:32,829 --> 01:23:35,481
Quite honestly, I'm afraid of children.
They're everywhere.

1327
01:23:35,645 --> 01:23:38,295
I know what you mean,
but Charlotte's all right.

1328
01:23:40,029 --> 01:23:42,813
So how can I help you?

1329
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,247
Do you have any Scotch?

1330
01:23:45,181 --> 01:23:46,196
Sorry, I don't.

1331
01:23:46,366 --> 01:23:48,025
That's all right.

1332
01:23:49,886 --> 01:23:52,058
I'm a lone wolf, Elektra.

1333
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,850
I've become more and more
secretive the older I get.

1334
01:23:58,015 --> 01:24:01,463
It's not really my nature.
It's this rotten fame as a novelist.

1335
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:06,039
I've learned to talk a lot, but I never
really reveal anything about myself.

1336
01:24:07,263 --> 01:24:09,849
To be quite honest,
I've had a bit of a day.

1337
01:24:10,016 --> 01:24:13,561
I had a terrible fight with my daughter,
whose boyfriend lives below you,

1338
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:17,405
technically her husband now.
That's how you came onto the radar.

1339
01:24:17,568 --> 01:24:20,699
I saw you coming out of that
limousine with that rock star.

1340
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,547
- Wait, Eleanor is your daughter?
- Yes.

1341
01:24:23,713 --> 01:24:27,707
Yes, and I love her desperately,
but she's just so spoiled.

1342
01:24:27,874 --> 01:24:29,018
It's just impossible.

1343
01:24:29,186 --> 01:24:30,810
Stop. I don't know what it is,

1344
01:24:30,977 --> 01:24:34,840
but everybody has this bizarre
compulsion to tell me their problems.

1345
01:24:35,265 --> 01:24:39,293
I know I look wise and enlightened,
but I cannot help you whatsoever.

1346
01:24:39,457 --> 01:24:40,832
I am a total mess myself.

1347
01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:44,190
I know. I know.
You're pregnant and you're broke

1348
01:24:44,355 --> 01:24:46,361
and you're in terrible debt
with the IRS

1349
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:48,832
and you don't have
any real career prospects.

1350
01:24:48,995 --> 01:24:51,548
Well, you don't have to put it
like that.

1351
01:24:53,634 --> 01:24:55,708
How do you feel
about self-help books?

1352
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:58,461
- I hate them.
- Same here.

1353
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:00,450
They only help the person
that writes them.

1354
01:25:00,612 --> 01:25:03,262
- I couldn't agree with you more.
- Right.

1355
01:25:05,188 --> 01:25:08,898
With all due respect, you are
going somewhere with this, right?

1356
01:25:09,059 --> 01:25:13,632
Oh, yes, I want to write a book
about your class.

1357
01:25:13,796 --> 01:25:15,106
About my class?

1358
01:25:15,523 --> 01:25:19,004
When a woman reaches my age,
Elektra...

1359
01:25:19,172 --> 01:25:21,474
Well, when a woman my age
writes mysteries,

1360
01:25:21,637 --> 01:25:24,223
everybody automatically assumes
that you're a lesbian,

1361
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:27,737
but in my case,
there's this cruel irony

1362
01:25:27,908 --> 01:25:32,546
in that when one finally figures out
how the equipment works,

1363
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:35,459
then all the men are dying
or they're chasing teenagers.

1364
01:25:35,814 --> 01:25:39,109
In fact, none of my friends
would ever guess

1365
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:42,915
that I am dating
my Filipino landscaper, Lamberto,

1366
01:25:43,077 --> 01:25:45,182
20 years my junior.

1367
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:48,219
And by "dating,"
I mean we mostly stay in bed.

1368
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:51,106
And all of that is due to you,
my dear.

1369
01:25:51,653 --> 01:25:58,278
I want to write a self-help book
that actually helps.

1370
01:25:58,439 --> 01:26:00,894
I've already spoken
to my publisher about it.

1371
01:26:01,063 --> 01:26:03,135
What did they say?

1372
01:26:03,464 --> 01:26:07,041
He wrote you an advance.

1373
01:26:09,448 --> 01:26:11,073
That's a lot of zeros, isn't it?

1374
01:26:11,241 --> 01:26:13,062
That's just the start.

1375
01:26:13,225 --> 01:26:14,818
Are you?

1376
01:26:15,113 --> 01:26:16,770
Is this real?

1377
01:26:16,936 --> 01:26:20,767
Oh, of course. Of course, sometimes
good things happen to good people.

1378
01:26:20,937 --> 01:26:22,976
Today, something good
is happening to you.

1379
01:26:25,577 --> 01:26:26,657
What did you say?

1380
01:26:27,145 --> 01:26:29,087
I sell a lot of books, Elektra.

1381
01:26:29,257 --> 01:26:32,105
And when a world-famous author
decides to dip her feet

1382
01:26:32,265 --> 01:26:34,370
into the waters
of the self-help arena,

1383
01:26:34,539 --> 01:26:37,440
well, let's just say
that my esteemed publisher

1384
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,456
will move mountains
to make sure it's a bona fide hit.

1385
01:26:40,874 --> 01:26:46,657
Especially something as titillating
and spiritually healing as:

1386
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:49,064
<i>How to Act Like a Porn Star in Bed.</i>

1387
01:26:50,059 --> 01:26:51,969
Swell title, by the way.

1388
01:26:52,138 --> 01:26:54,441
Thank you. It came to me
while I was in the shower.

1389
01:26:54,603 --> 01:26:57,735
- We're gonna have to change it.
- Oh, yeah?

1390
01:26:57,898 --> 01:27:01,642
Yes, something a little catchier
with a little ring to it. Maybe:

1391
01:27:02,732 --> 01:27:04,553
<i>Women in Ecstasy.</i>

1392
01:27:06,508 --> 01:27:08,263
<i>Woman in Ecstasy.</i>

1393
01:27:08,428 --> 01:27:11,078
Yes, how's that roll off your tongue?

1394
01:27:11,948 --> 01:27:12,994
I like it.

1395
01:27:13,164 --> 01:27:14,211
Yeah?

1396
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:19,941
You know, they say all it takes
to survive bad fortune

1397
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,213
is decent manners.

1398
01:27:22,763 --> 01:27:26,180
But good fortune,
that takes character.

1399
01:27:27,757 --> 01:27:31,173
You're going to be a very
rich woman, Elektra Luxx.

1400
01:27:31,533 --> 01:27:34,086
Better make sure
your head's on right.

1401
01:27:34,255 --> 01:27:37,004
As right as it's ever gonna be.

1402
01:27:39,246 --> 01:27:42,541
<i>To Women in Ecstasy.</i>

1403
01:27:42,703 --> 01:27:47,110
<i>To Women in Ecstasy.</i>

1404
01:27:48,975 --> 01:27:53,284
"When you begin to mount the edge
of the most fantastic shivering spasm,

1405
01:27:53,456 --> 01:27:56,040
it's not bad form
to look him in the eye and say:

1406
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:59,470
'I don't know where I'm going,
but if you move, I will kill you.'

1407
01:27:59,632 --> 01:28:02,348
And if you're with a woman,
you might compliment her hair.

1408
01:28:02,512 --> 01:28:03,974
Nothing makes us more insecure,

1409
01:28:04,144 --> 01:28:05,999
even with our ankles
behind our ears,

1410
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,365
than our hair looking all funny."

1411
01:28:10,097 --> 01:28:14,766
Chapter two: "How to Seduce
Just About Anything that Moves."

1412
01:28:14,929 --> 01:28:16,838
Which is a good place
for us to stop.

1413
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:19,430
You will have to buy the book
to find out.

1414
01:28:33,009 --> 01:28:36,357
Oh, hey, Jean, how
lovely of you to come.

1415
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:40,109
Of course. I started talking dirty
to my husband in the act.

1416
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,510
It's completely changed
the way we communicate.

1417
01:28:42,675 --> 01:28:44,431
Not just in the bed, all the time.

1418
01:28:44,882 --> 01:28:48,298
Turns out I have a real flair
for coming up with the filthiest things.

1419
01:28:48,467 --> 01:28:52,460
- He can't get enough.
- That is great, dear, whatever it takes.

1420
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,602
Thank you.

1421
01:28:59,508 --> 01:29:00,850
- Lamberto.
- Excuse me, sir.

1422
01:29:01,108 --> 01:29:03,726
The only merchandise she's signing
is the book.

1423
01:29:04,244 --> 01:29:05,902
- Bert?
- Hi, Elektra.

1424
01:29:06,068 --> 01:29:08,238
Oh, he's okay, Lamberto.
How are you doing?

1425
01:29:08,405 --> 01:29:12,148
Very good, very good. How are you?
You look so curvaceous.

1426
01:29:12,309 --> 01:29:14,163
Oh, well, I'm about to explode.

1427
01:29:14,772 --> 01:29:16,912
- How is the website doing?
- Very good.

1428
01:29:17,077 --> 01:29:19,564
We have a new layout
for easier site navigation.

1429
01:29:19,732 --> 01:29:22,384
- My girlfriend, Trixie, designed it.
- You have a girlfriend?

1430
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:26,226
Six months. She helped me through a
hard time. Would you like to meet her?

1431
01:29:26,389 --> 01:29:28,780
- Yeah. Of course.
BERT: Yeah? Yeah.

1432
01:29:28,949 --> 01:29:31,120
- Hi.
- Hi, Trixie. I'm Elektra.

1433
01:29:31,286 --> 01:29:33,904
- I've heard so much about you.
- You can't prove any of it.

1434
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,209
Oh, it's all good, don't worry.

1435
01:29:38,133 --> 01:29:42,389
Yes, Elektra, well, first off,
congratulations on this epochal event.

1436
01:29:42,551 --> 01:29:44,438
Your debut,
it's sure to be a bestseller.

1437
01:29:44,598 --> 01:29:47,664
We have links on our website
to almost every online retailer

1438
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:50,318
...that carries the book. Yeah.
- That's so nice of you.

1439
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:53,909
Go on, ask her.

1440
01:29:54,071 --> 01:29:57,269
- What?
- Well, now that you're pregnant,

1441
01:29:57,431 --> 01:30:00,300
there's been unprecedented
chat-board speculation

1442
01:30:00,471 --> 01:30:03,123
since you're so famously
naturally endowed

1443
01:30:03,289 --> 01:30:07,346
as to exactly how much bigger
your breasts have gotten.

1444
01:30:07,832 --> 01:30:10,800
And we conducted a poll
guessing actual measurements,

1445
01:30:10,968 --> 01:30:13,390
but I promised
I'd make an inquiry.

1446
01:30:15,128 --> 01:30:19,734
If it's not too offensive to ask.

1447
01:30:19,994 --> 01:30:25,176
Yeah, uh, Miss Luxx, he means
it in the most innocent way.

1448
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,113
Water...

1449
01:30:28,281 --> 01:30:31,860
- You wanna take a water break?
- No, no, no. That's not what I mean.

1450
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:33,881
Oh, you want us
to get you some water.

1451
01:30:34,042 --> 01:30:37,272
No, no, no. I don't need any water.
I think my water just broke.

1452
01:30:37,818 --> 01:30:40,784
- Your what?
- My water just... It broke.

1453
01:30:40,954 --> 01:30:44,271
Holy Jesus, her water broke.
Oh, my God. Are you gonna be okay?

1454
01:30:44,443 --> 01:30:46,831
Call a cab.
Put this in the trunk flat, not folded.

1455
01:30:47,002 --> 01:30:49,075
- Yeah. Excuse me.
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

1456
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,960
- I have a car. I can bring it around.
- Dell?

1457
01:30:52,123 --> 01:30:53,880
BERT: I'll get you to a hospital.
ELEKTRA: Sure?

1458
01:30:54,043 --> 01:30:55,899
Yes, I'm sure.
Come on, work with me.

1459
01:30:56,059 --> 01:30:57,237
Please don't drop me.

1460
01:30:57,404 --> 01:31:00,252
Elektra Luxx, I would die
a happy man before I drop you.

1461
01:31:00,412 --> 01:31:02,200
Let's go get this baby born.

1462
01:31:02,364 --> 01:31:04,120
Come on, people,
work with me here.

1463
01:33:15,013 --> 01:33:19,835
<i>ANNOUNCER: Watch Elektra Luxx in her farewell

1464

You wanna play games?

1465
01:33:22,758 --> 01:33:23,968
I like games.

1466
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:26,880
When I ask you a question,
you'll know.

you want her to be doing.</i>

Good. I was tired of sheep.

What about the parole board?

1475
01:33:48,231 --> 01:33:50,119
I am the parole board.

1476
01:33:50,278 --> 01:33:51,872
I see.

01:33:52,039 --> 01:33:55,169

I could eat a horse.

Try me instead. I taste better.

1482
01:34:08,585 --> 01:34:10,560
Hot dog.

1483

I will turn you into manure.
