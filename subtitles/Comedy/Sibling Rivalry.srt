1
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,293
This is the story...

2
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,794
of how I almost lived
my entire adult life...

3
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,797
in a functional coma...

4
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:30,799
instead of becoming the writer
I always dreamed I'd be...

5
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,802
like Sylvia Plath, only happy.

6
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:36,305
To be a writer
was my childhood dream...

7
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:39,307
but like my childhood,
the dream was sweet...

8
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:40,725
but mostly it was short.

9
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,269
My parents died
in a car accident...

10
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:45,812
leaving my sister
and me orphans.

11
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:48,107
My sister acted
like a brat at the funeral...

12
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:49,983
setting a life-long pattern...

13
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,986
of always doing and saying
whatever she felt.

14
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:59,033
As for me, the next twelve years
were very lonely...

15
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,326
until...

16
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:04,871
With this ring,
I thee wed.

17
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:12,420
His name was Harry Turner,
and we were in love.

18
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,381
I thought everything
was going to be perfect...

19
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:18,426
and it might have been,
except for one thing...

20
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:21,387
Harry was already married
to someone else...

21
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,430
his family.

22
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,433
Harry joined
their medical practice...

23
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:28,935
and although I had his hand
in holy matrimony...

24
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,603
they had his shingle.

25
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:35,400
Harry became a brilliant
gastroenterologist...

26
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,277
who really knew his way
around an intestine.

27
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:39,778
See this part here?

28
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,990
To people on the outside...

29
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,952
I'm sure it looked like
we had a happy life together...

30
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:48,953
and for a while,
I thought we did, too.

31
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:50,955
I mean, things
weren't exactly...

32
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:53,373
the way I would
have liked them...

33
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:54,958
but I learned
to make compromises...

34
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,461
which is how we achieved
a balance in our marriage.

35
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:00,422
The problem is...

36
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,340
somewhere during
eight years of balancing...

37
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,885
I stopped thinking
of myself as me.

38
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:07,929
All I was was Harry's wife.

39
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:09,388
Hi. How are you?

40
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,601
We were one of those couples
who did everything together...

41
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,437
except communicate.

42
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:41,125
Good night, dear.

43
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,672
You didn't want
to make love, did you?

44
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:49,424
No, no. That's all right.

45
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:50,884
Good.

46
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:52,885
Sex wasn't everything,
but it was...

47
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:55,889
one of the few things we did
without Harry's family.

48
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,683
So when that began to fade,
I should have said something...

49
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,393
but I didn't know how.

50
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,355
Harry, I thought I'd make...

51
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,524
a nice, big pot roast
for your family tonight...

52
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:08,858
or turkey.

53
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,026
What do you think?

54
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:14,322
Harry, can you hear me?

55
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:16,866
Hello?

56
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,992
Come on in, Iris.

57
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:20,702
Your front door was open.

58
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:21,745
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:23,371
You want some coffee?

60
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:24,873
Please.

61
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:26,834
Marjorie? Coffee.

62
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,126
I'll need some milk with that.

63
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:30,670
With milk.

64
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,170
What's this?

65
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,173
"We love you loads,
Uncle Charles."

66
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:36,092
The kids made it themselves.

67
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:38,093
How can they love him loads?

68
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:40,095
He left for Costa Rica
before they were born.

69
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:42,888
I think they're just proud
to have an uncle...

70
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:44,891
that helps so many people.

71
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,476
All doctors help people.

72
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,894
Charles travels all over
the world helping people.

73
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:51,105
I don't think all doctors
do that, Harry.

74
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:52,480
Here you go.

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,733
Just like you like it...
with one splash.

76
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,569
Low-fat.

77
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,487
There's no problem.
Low-fat.

78
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:02,072
Anyway, the kids
can't wait to meet him.

79
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:03,700
I can't, either.

80
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,577
It's so weird having
a brother-in-law...

81
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,119
that I don't even know.

82
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,954
It's weirder having
a brother you don't know.

83
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:11,081
What's that supposed to mean?

84
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:14,543
My own brother sends me
one letter in fifteen years.

85
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,919
When you're off winning
the Nobel Peace Prize...

86
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,588
you can't be expected to write
a bunch of letters.

87
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,256
Did Charles win
a Nobel Peace Prize?

88
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:22,174
He didn't win.
He was just nominated.

89
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,801
Why do you do this?

90
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,137
Do you think he'll like me?

91
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:29,431
Of course he'll like you.
You're Harry's wife.

92
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,765
Here you go. Low-fat.

93
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,436
Too late. Gotta go.
Got a C-section at 9:00.

94
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,438
And I've got a polyp at 9:30.

95
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,446
Hiya, doll.
How's my sweetheart?

96
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,947
Tired. Haven't seen you
in a while, Nick.

97
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,449
You been busy?

98
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,950
Yeah. Busy, busy, busy.

99
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,952
Having lunch
with my brother today.

100
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:54,454
He's here.

101
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:55,622
Good.

102
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,122
How's the fish fry?

103
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,916
I wouldn't eat it, honey.

104
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,378
Hey, Wilbur!

105
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:05,005
I hear the fish fry
is no good...

106
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:07,799
but I got a feeling
about the meat loaf.

107
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,635
Your landlord called me today.

108
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:14,263
You haven't paid your rent
in four months.

109
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:16,848
Your landlord says
you owe $1,200 back rent.

110
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:18,308
I know.

111
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:20,477
And I'm going to go
over to his office...

112
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:22,020
after this lunch...

113
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,980
and pay him part
of what I owe him...

114
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,816
as a good faith kind of thing.

115
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:27,983
Good. How much you
going to give him?

116
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:29,235
$200.

117
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,654
Where are you going
to get the money?

118
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:33,155
Can you loan me 200 bucks?

119
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:36,324
No, just until I close this
big deal that I'm working on.

120
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,659
All right, Nick, look...

121
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:40,161
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

122
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,455
I'm going to lend you
the whole $1,200.

123
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:44,999
Oh, no, no. Wilbur,
I can't take that much!

124
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,626
Nick, you know I'm up
for chief of police.

125
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:49,711
I know.
I can't believe it.

126
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,713
But this kind of thing...

127
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:53,799
could really hurt
my chances, Nick.

128
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,634
You know, my brother
getting evicted...

129
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:57,343
for not paying his rent.

130
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,095
Right.

131
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,929
I'm under
a magnifying glass, Nick.

132
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,849
I got to get appointed
by the mayor.

133
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,351
You get to meet the mayor?

134
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,562
It's all public.
You could blow this for me.

135
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:11,314
You deserve
to be chief of police...

136
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:15,318
and I'm going to do everything
I can do to help, and...

137
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:18,112
because we're brothers, and...

138
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:20,823
I love you.

139
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,825
I love you,
I love you,

140
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:24,702
I love you,
I love you!

141
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,163
Yeah. You wanted to see me, Pat?

142
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:30,039
Shut the door.

143
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,837
You've been working for me
for three months today...

144
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:39,339
and you haven't sold
one set of blinds.

145
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:40,465
Can I sit down here?

146
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:41,675
No.

147
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:45,053
Face it, Nick...

148
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,139
You're just not a salesman.

149
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:50,433
Oh, Pat, don't say that.

150
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,643
You're hurting me.

151
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:54,145
I gotta let you go.

152
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:55,937
No, Pat. No. Not yet!

153
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:59,858
You see, I...
I've got an appointment here...

154
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:02,027
and I'm going down now to...

155
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:03,779
I'm going to the Sheraton.

156
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,362
The Sheraton?

157
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:08,699
Yeah. I am going to put
an A-1 Acme vertical blind...

158
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,243
in every window in every room
in that hotel.

159
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,787
But the Sheraton's got drapes.

160
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:16,873
Exactly.

161
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,922
Hi, J.

162
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:25,422
Hi. What's wrong?

163
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:28,926
Nothing. I just came by
to drop these off.

164
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:30,594
Why?

165
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:32,596
Because I thought
this would be...

166
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,181
a real good opportunity
for you to think about...

167
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:36,766
going to community college.

168
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:38,768
What are you,
my career counsellor?

169
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:40,937
No. I'm your sister.

170
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:43,439
Jeanine, I just think...

171
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,440
that you can do
better than this.

172
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,526
I like fish.

173
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:49,736
Of course you like fish, because
you don't have to have...

174
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,238
a real relationship
with a fish.

175
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:54,449
I think you are
very, very unhappy...

176
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,367
and I'm glad we're
talking about it...

177
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,371
because I think you have a lot
of feelings bottled up inside.

178
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,955
What are you talking about?

179
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:02,456
Does Harry go down on you?

180
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,792
I didn't think so.

181
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:08,002
Please do not
talk to me like this.

182
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:11,756
I bet you've never come
even once in your life.

183
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:14,466
You just... Get back here,
young lady.

184
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:15,926
Listen to me.

185
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:18,303
This is why you don't
have a relationship!

186
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:19,763
What?

187
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:22,349
This... that... because you are
so forward.

188
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:24,392
I'm not forward.
I'm honest.

189
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:25,935
Is that what you call it?

190
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:29,480
Is that why you're single,
making minimum wage?

191
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,858
I don't want a relationship.
I'm independent.

192
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,484
And as a matter of fact...

193
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,152
I have had
quite a few relationships.

194
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,070
No. To qualify
as a relationship...

195
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,031
it has to last
longer than 24 hours!

196
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,867
At least I didn't marry
the first guy who felt me up.

197
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,368
He isn't the first guy who...
I had some...

198
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:46,454
Could you grab those, please?

199
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,502
Do you love Harry?

200
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:57,630
Yes, I love Harry.
He is my husband.

201
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:01,176
Why don't you like him?

202
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:02,635
I like him.

203
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:05,637
It's just that his whole family
treats me like street scum.

204
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:07,473
They have never used
that exact term.

205
00:11:07,473 --> 00:11:08,891
Ever since you met this guy...

206
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:10,809
your life got wrapped up
into this neat little package.

207
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,853
You even stopped writing.
You used to love to write.

208
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,855
That was a long time ago.

209
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,398
And I never was a real writer.

210
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,359
You wrote short stories.

211
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,028
Those weren't short stories.
Those were novels.

212
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,737
I just never finished them.

213
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:27,199
You started them a lot,
and since you got married...

214
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,950
you stopped even starting them.

215
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,410
This is ridiculous.

216
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,371
I know you were a virgin
when you got married.

217
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:39,418
Don't you ever wonder
if Harry's doing it right?

218
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,378
Harry is doing it fine!

219
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:43,797
And even if he weren't,
it's none of your business.

220
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:47,718
You know what you should do?
You should have an affair.

221
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:48,968
What?

222
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:51,179
Then at least you'd have
some frame of reference.

223
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,889
Do you know something?

224
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,057
I have spent
most of my life...

225
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:57,226
pretending like
you are retarded...

226
00:11:57,226 --> 00:12:00,854
just so I can stand
being related to you!

227
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,199
You dented your cheese.

228
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,415
Is this checkout line closed?

229
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:26,878
No. The cashier just went to get
my credit card approved.

230
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:30,464
She's going to let you use
a credit card to buy just that?

231
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:33,258
No. I'm buying one of those
fruit baskets over there.

232
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:35,051
This goes with that.

233
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,304
What do you think?

234
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:40,557
People really like
those kind of things?

235
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,642
I don't know.
I suppose so.

236
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:44,893
Would you like it?

237
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:48,856
I don't know!
Sorry.

238
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:52,025
You could use your anger
in a more productive way.

239
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,445
How's that?

240
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:58,281
You could help me
write this card.

241
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:00,450
It might calm you down.

242
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,328
What's the present for?

243
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,831
A party.

244
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:09,332
But I'm having second thoughts
about going.

245
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:13,794
OK. Everything's ready.
Your order's in.

246
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,882
Let's see...
I got the address.

247
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,384
They're making up your basket
in the back...

248
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,844
and we'll send it out
as soon as it's done.

249
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,804
OK. Thanks.

250
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,348
You done with that card yet?

251
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,476
Not yet.
I was just getting some help.

252
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,855
What do you say?

253
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,275
So then you don't really
want to go to this party?

254
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,860
No, not really.

255
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,487
I feel obligated, but...

256
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:46,200
Tell them to start without you.

257
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:48,618
OK.

258
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:55,248
That way, you know...

259
00:13:56,751 --> 00:14:00,545
You could go late,
if you wanted to.

260
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:10,346
Chardonnay.
Bourbon and soda.

261
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:11,680
Enjoy.

262
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:21,022
Why were you so angry?

263
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:23,524
I was just upset.

264
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:25,527
Somebody upset me... my sister.

265
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:27,861
You shouldn't
let her bother you.

266
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:32,824
She thinks that I need to...
improve myself.

267
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:37,870
You shouldn't pay so much
attention to your family.

268
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,748
Anyone can see that
you don't need improvement.

269
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,041
You don't know me.

270
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,379
Not that I don't appreciate...

271
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:48,547
that you think
that I don't need any.

272
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,928
I like you
much better this way.

273
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,388
How's that?

274
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:59,557
You're in a good mood now.

275
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:04,310
I think you put me
in a good mood.

276
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,896
How'd I do that?

277
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,439
I don't know.

278
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,316
I guess it's nice
to just, you know...

279
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:14,362
be able to just be myself.

280
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,364
Instead of?

281
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:18,365
Instead of what
I'm supposed to be.

282
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,453
- You know, good.
- Oops!

283
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:25,289
Oh... I'm Sorry.

284
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,915
What does that mean...
Good?

285
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:31,376
Sometimes people just think...

286
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:35,590
that you're always supposed
to act one certain way.

287
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,593
And that can just get
sort of tiring.

288
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,302
You're being good now?

289
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:48,809
I'm not.

290
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:53,814
I don't even know you...

291
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:56,608
And I never talk to strangers.

292
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:05,784
Are you always good?

293
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:08,494
Yeah, pretty much.
I try to be.

294
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,621
Did you ever try not to be?

295
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,293
I don't think anybody
would recognize me.

296
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:25,218
I don't think people
would really like it if...

297
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:30,805
if I wasn't being...
the person that they think I am.

298
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:36,185
So you're protecting everyone
from this other side you have.

299
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,980
Must be a pretty
dangerous side.

300
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,152
You been hiding yourself
for a long time?

301
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:51,907
As long as I can remember.

302
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:55,869
I bet it would be real nice
to let the real you out.

303
00:16:57,996 --> 00:17:02,250
I don't even know
if I know how to do that.

304
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:06,170
Do you?

305
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:19,683
My, my, my Aunt Jemimah!

306
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:24,855
Sweet, sweet...

307
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:27,773
This is delightful.

308
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:32,026
Oh, my god,
you are truly gifted!

309
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:34,697
What is that you're doing?

310
00:17:34,697 --> 00:17:38,867
That's good!
That's very good.

311
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:42,871
This is very pleasurable!

312
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,831
In-a-gadda-da-vida!

313
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,293
Are you a jogger?

314
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:52,004
I can't take any more.

315
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,131
God! Whoa, whoa!

316
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:56,132
Jesus!

317
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:57,633
Just take me...

318
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,135
This is so...

319
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:00,469
I can't take it anymore.

320
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:01,721
Yes, I can. I can.

321
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,806
Just give it to me.
OK, just...

322
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:13,231
Oh, god, rock and roll!

323
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,733
Is this all the mail
from yesterday?

324
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,735
Yes. I believe that'll be it.

325
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:19,694
I'll take care of it.

326
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,784
Hi, Don.
How's it going?

327
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:29,537
Mr. Diamond doesn't want
vertical blinds, Nick.

328
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:33,291
Mr. Diamond hasn't seen
my vertical blinds.

329
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:37,294
And because you and I are
old friends from high school...

330
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:39,338
I thought that
I'd give your boss...

331
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:41,799
first peek at the new line...

332
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,884
before I brought them
across town to the Hyatt.

333
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:46,427
There's no way, Nick.

334
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:48,554
There is a way, Donnie.

335
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:51,808
If I can hang them
in one of the rooms...

336
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:56,353
if Mr. Diamond can see
what they do for a window...

337
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:58,563
they sell themselves.

338
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:02,526
They sell themselves.

339
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:09,447
I think I just made up
for the last eight years.

340
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,534
I don't know your name...

341
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:14,786
and you don't know my name,
and that's good...

342
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,790
because this
can never happen again.

343
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:25,587
I hope it does...
but with my husband, not you.

344
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:27,256
I never had an...

345
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,011
I always knew
that I had it in me.

346
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:37,765
You just made me feel so...

347
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,479
Whatever you did was just so...

348
00:19:48,316 --> 00:19:50,318
We've got to get up.

349
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:52,112
I have to go.

350
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:57,658
You going to wake up,
sleepy head?

351
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:01,412
Come on. Get up.

352
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,610
Oh, god!

353
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:40,989
404...

354
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,449
401.

355
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,336
All right.

356
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:01,841
Wrong key.

357
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:09,598
Oh, jeez!

358
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:11,308
This is my fault.
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,017
I'll get that.

360
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:14,811
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

361
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:16,771
No. Wait.

362
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:18,815
I don't believe this happened.

363
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:20,817
Look, here's your...

364
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:22,026
Here's your... things.

365
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:24,319
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,821
Your personal...

367
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,614
Yep!

368
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:29,324
Yeah.

369
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:30,325
Oh, boy!

370
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:33,828
I can't believe this day!

371
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:38,624
The wallet!

372
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:46,089
Got to give it to Donnie.

373
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:52,928
Wait a minute.

374
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:09,235
Your... door's open.

375
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:46,810
I see you put up the sign.
Thanks, Harry.

376
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,312
Where have you been?

377
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:51,315
I've been...
I've been with my...

378
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:52,648
my sister.

379
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:54,484
What were you doing
with your sister?

380
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,194
You've got a dinner to cook.

381
00:22:56,194 --> 00:22:57,987
I know that!

382
00:22:57,987 --> 00:22:59,989
I have to take a shower.

383
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:01,741
Isn't your sister coming
to help you?

384
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:04,326
No.
Yes, she's coming.

385
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:06,788
Of course she's coming.
Why wouldn't she come?

386
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:17,421
I'm a sinner!

387
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:19,382
I'm a killer sinner.

388
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:21,175
I'm a sinful killer!

389
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:24,928
Oh, god!
Forgive me, please!

390
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,221
Forgive me.

391
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:33,352
9-1-1-1.

392
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:34,770
No, not...

393
00:23:35,854 --> 00:23:37,606
9-1-1.

394
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:43,361
Hello!

395
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:47,949
I'd like to make
an anonymous report.

396
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:50,284
Is that OK?

397
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,703
Yes, please.

398
00:23:54,788 --> 00:23:56,873
I just thought
you should know...

399
00:23:56,873 --> 00:24:00,293
that there is
a dead man in room 402...

400
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:02,670
at the Summit Bluff Sheraton.

401
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,880
Did you get all that?

402
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,716
Yeah, I got it.

403
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:08,008
Good.

404
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:11,886
Ma'am? Hello?

405
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:15,808
Ma'am, hello?

406
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:21,228
Summit Bluff Sheraton.
May I help you?

407
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:24,773
This is Officer Rodriguez
with the Summit Bluff police.

408
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,400
Let me talk to hotel security.

409
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:38,745
Mr. Diamond, the elegant choice
for the Nineties.

410
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,663
That's one.

411
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,376
Anybody in there?

412
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,169
Wait!

413
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:48,754
Don't open the door!

414
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,255
Sorry. I'm just
getting undressed.

415
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:54,383
Hotel security.
Everything OK in there?

416
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:58,095
Yes. Everything's fine.

417
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:01,723
I'm here alone,
and nothing's wrong.

418
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:05,394
I got a call about some trouble
in this room.

419
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:10,814
I didn't call.
Haven't used the phone, so...

420
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:12,399
There's no trouble here.

421
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,901
OK.

422
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:15,652
Sorry to bother you.

423
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:18,405
Don't worry about it.

424
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,116
All right.

425
00:25:22,116 --> 00:25:23,659
OK.

426
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:29,457
That's one.

427
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:56,815
The bracket...

428
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,486
Darn it, bracket!

429
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,994
Stuck.

430
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:23,881
Oh, my god!
I'm sorry!

431
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:25,924
I didn't know you were asleep.

432
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:27,342
Oh... blood!

433
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,262
Oh! Oh, boy!

434
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:32,805
You've been hurt!

435
00:26:32,805 --> 00:26:34,932
All right. All right.
Just relax! Relax.

436
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,310
Hello?

437
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:41,396
Hello!

438
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:43,566
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!

439
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:45,650
Oh... oh, My g...

440
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,486
Pulse. Pulse. Come on!

441
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:58,162
He's dead.

442
00:26:58,162 --> 00:27:00,455
He's definitely...

443
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:01,956
He's definitely dead.

444
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,252
This isn't good.

445
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:10,255
This definitely isn't good.

446
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,757
Look...

447
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:14,260
What am I going to do?

448
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,262
I'll call the...

449
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:22,266
No, I guess I'll go to the desk
and tell them that...

450
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,769
I can't believe it!

451
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:30,273
Wait. Donnie won't like this.
Donnie won't like this.

452
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:34,028
I'll call...
I'll call...

453
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,571
I don't know who to call.

454
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,075
I remember this day.

455
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:43,411
I tried so hard not to cry.

456
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,914
I was so proud
of our new little Dr. Charles.

457
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:50,625
Charles Junior was
a very fine-looking young man!

458
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,921
I never realized how much
he looks like me.

459
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,089
Look at me.
Was I ever really that cute?

460
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:58,925
You must have been.
Look at you now.

461
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,259
Why wasn't I in this picture?

462
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,721
I think you were sick.
You were always getting sick.

463
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,351
Not me.

464
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,769
It's not me.

465
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:12,854
Not me.

466
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:14,105
It's never me.

467
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,606
It's me.

468
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:18,067
Honey, why don't you tell them
about your urethra.

469
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:22,321
I had to dilate
a urethra today...

470
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:24,114
One millimetre.

471
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,035
Here's your radishes.

472
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,668
Hello?

473
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:40,837
Hello.

474
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:43,798
May I speak
to Marjorie Turner, please?

475
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:45,717
This is she.

476
00:28:45,717 --> 00:28:50,012
Yes. You don't know me,
but I have some bad news...

477
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:51,472
about your husband.

478
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:56,351
Your husband
has had an accident.

479
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,941
Hello? Hello? Hello?

480
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:07,570
Who was that?

481
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,862
Prank call.

482
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:16,661
Hello?

483
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:18,704
Mrs. Turner...

484
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:22,500
your husband's had an accident
in his hotel room.

485
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,209
Who is this?

486
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:30,256
Mrs. Turner, he's had
a very severe accident.

487
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:33,176
You have the wrong number.

488
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:34,302
No, I don't.

489
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,180
Who was it?
A breather?

490
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:40,475
Sort of.

491
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:54,236
What?

492
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:56,238
Mrs. Turner,
this isn't a joke.

493
00:29:56,238 --> 00:29:58,323
So please don't hang up on me.

494
00:29:58,323 --> 00:30:00,326
How do you know my name?

495
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:02,578
And where did you get
this phone number?

496
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:09,041
I found your wallet
here in the hallway...

497
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,960
and I have it in the hotel.

498
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,131
Thank you so much.

499
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:18,925
Let me just go check.
I'll be right with you.

500
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:29,727
Darn it.

501
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,729
You are correct.

502
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,605
Mrs. Turner...

503
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:37,234
I think your husband is dead.

504
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:40,529
Listen to me.
I need that wallet.

505
00:30:41,822 --> 00:30:43,864
What about your husband?

506
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:45,825
Listen to me.
Just stay put.

507
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:47,909
I will meet you there
in 20 minutes.

508
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,912
And don't call anyone
until I get there.

509
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,334
Stay here.

510
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:03,257
Who was that?

511
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:04,591
I have to go out a minute.

512
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:06,885
Where?

513
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:09,430
Somebody found my wallet.

514
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,974
They're at the grocery store
waiting to pick it...

515
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:14,892
Would you get that, please?

516
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:16,436
You can't go now!

517
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:17,769
I have to!

518
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:19,939
It's got my license in it.
It has all my credit cards.

519
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:21,941
It has everything,
and they want me to come.

520
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:23,525
What about dinner?

521
00:31:25,944 --> 00:31:27,611
You cook.

522
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,906
I don't cook.
I reheat.

523
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:31,783
Oh, god.
All right, I'll start.

524
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:34,368
You get over here.

525
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,954
This is chicken.
Here is the recipe.

526
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:39,749
We are making veal marsala.

527
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:42,625
Chicken!
Chicken marsala!

528
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,337
Take a piece
of chicken like this.

529
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,629
Slice, slice, slice, slice.

530
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:51,800
This afternoon, I cut out
half of a lower intestine.

531
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,345
It seemed like it was
a quarter of a mile long!

532
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,763
Where is Charles Junior?

533
00:31:56,763 --> 00:31:59,642
He's late.
He said he'd be here at 7:00.

534
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:01,435
It's only 8:00.

535
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:05,647
Hello.

536
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:07,648
Excuse me for a few minutes.

537
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:09,108
Where are you going?

538
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:10,693
Where's she going?

539
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:13,362
To... out. I'm going
to the grocery store.

540
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:15,322
I left my wallet there...

541
00:32:15,322 --> 00:32:17,323
and the people
that work there...

542
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:19,660
would very much like me
to come and get it.

543
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,702
Can't your sister go
and pick it up...

544
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:24,163
No! Because...

545
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:26,290
I have to sign for it,
of course...

546
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,417
to prove that it's mine.

547
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,586
Can't you just wait
until my brother gets here?

548
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:32,712
I would like to make
a good impression.

549
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:34,881
I would like the whole family
here to greet him.

550
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:36,216
Who's going to cook dinner?

551
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:37,759
My sister.

552
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,843
Let's go out to eat.

553
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:41,512
Marjorie!
Your sister can't cook.

554
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:44,640
Yes, she can. I just taught her.
It's just chicken, Harry.

555
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:48,268
There's Charles.

556
00:32:56,692 --> 00:32:58,194
Dr. Turner?

557
00:32:58,194 --> 00:32:59,696
What the...

558
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:01,989
If you'd just sign here, please.

559
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,117
I'll bet this is
from the polypectomy...

560
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,869
I did this morning.

561
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:11,914
The young lady
seemed very grateful.

562
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,792
Oh, it's lovely.

563
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,545
What does she say?

564
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:22,007
This is typical.
It's from Charles.

565
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,260
Charles?

566
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,221
Charles sent fruit.
Isn't that sweet?

567
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,015
It's an hour late.
This isn't fruit.

568
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:31,807
This is a total lack
of consideration.

569
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:33,809
It looks like fruit to me.

570
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:36,311
What does the card say?

571
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:39,857
"Start without me."

572
00:33:39,857 --> 00:33:41,816
He's going to be late.

573
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,615
All right, Mrs. Turner,
do you remember me?

574
00:33:49,615 --> 00:33:53,118
I just wanted to tell you that
I didn't mean any of this...

575
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,120
and I know
you must be just...

576
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,664
But I just feel so terrible.

577
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:59,374
Do you have my wallet?

578
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:00,459
Pardon me?

579
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,209
My wallet.

580
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:14,763
I'm in the vertical
blinds business, right?

581
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,973
And I was doing
an installation here.

582
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,809
I'll show you.

583
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:23,395
I was like this,
working on the window...

584
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,897
and I didn't see him sleeping.

585
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,361
Sleeping?

586
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:35,197
Yeah. I was having trouble
with this bracket...

587
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:37,617
which is not normally the case
with this particular model...

588
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:41,745
but I had to use force,
and I jammed up in there.

589
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,538
This got caught...

590
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:45,414
and I was pulling
and pulling and pulling...

591
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:48,126
and then it came loose
and... Oh, jeez!

592
00:34:48,126 --> 00:34:49,920
Just about like that.

593
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,420
And...

594
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:55,173
It came down right on him.

595
00:34:55,173 --> 00:35:01,262
It stabbed him, really,
right in the left temple.

596
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:08,061
Right there.

597
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:17,403
At least he went in his sleep.

598
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:22,365
It was quick.
I doubt if he felt any pain.

599
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:25,368
Are you all right?

600
00:35:25,368 --> 00:35:28,621
Do you want any...
Do you want any water?

601
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:30,247
No, thank you.

602
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:34,126
I guess I should just
call the hospital.

603
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:36,378
No, you can't do that!
You can't call the hospital.

604
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:39,839
Why not?

605
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,679
Because I can't bring him
to the hospital.

606
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,806
Why is that?

607
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:52,684
Because he's not my husband.

608
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,228
No... now, Mrs. Turner,
let's face the facts.

609
00:35:55,228 --> 00:35:56,730
Sit down.

610
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,815
Your husband is a doctor.

611
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:00,274
Yes, he is, but...

612
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:03,861
No. I found his wallet,
and I looked in the I.D.

613
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:07,197
So I know he's your husband...
Dr. Charles Turner.

614
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:09,866
No. That is my...
This is...

615
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,202
He's my brother-in-law.

616
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:15,204
Let's stick with reality.

617
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:18,041
You both have
the same last name.

618
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:22,669
That's how we both
have the same last name.

619
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:32,887
I didn't know he was
my brother-in-law.

620
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:39,225
I had never met him...
until this afternoon.

621
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:42,145
I guess you two
just hit it off, then.

622
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:44,356
Yeah, we really did.

623
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:48,901
But my husband doesn't
know about this...

624
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:51,904
and I would be
ever so grateful...

625
00:36:51,904 --> 00:36:54,823
if you could be here
when the police arrive.

626
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:56,075
Police?

627
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:57,576
Yeah, and you know what?

628
00:36:57,576 --> 00:37:00,828
They wouldn't even have to know
that I was here today...

629
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:02,747
if you didn't want to tell them.

630
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:05,041
No, we can't call the police.

631
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:09,169
What I mean is, you can
call the police, but I can't.

632
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:12,172
I can't even be here
when the police arrive.

633
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:13,966
How come?

634
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:16,718
I just can't.

635
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,181
What are we going to do
about him?

636
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:24,684
Maybe if I call the hospital.

637
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:26,686
No, you can't call
the hospital, either...

638
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:28,062
because if you call
the hospital...

639
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:29,396
they will notify the police.

640
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:31,273
That's standard procedure.
I know that.

641
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:32,565
What about your family?
Can't you call anybody?

642
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:35,235
No! I can't call my family!
They would tell my husband...

643
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:37,195
and he would find out
that I... Oh, god!

644
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:39,196
What are we going to do?

645
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:41,991
I don't know. I don't know
what we're doing! God!

646
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,201
All right.
This is a definite tragedy...

647
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:46,161
but it's also an accident...

648
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:48,163
and I think we ought to not
lose sight of that.

649
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:49,789
He's dead!

650
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,710
I think we ought to not
lose sight of that!

651
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,252
Let's stay calm.

652
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:56,212
How am I supposed
to stay calm?

653
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:57,714
All right,
I'll tell you what.

654
00:37:57,714 --> 00:38:00,799
I think we should
probably just...

655
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:05,595
I think we should
get rid of the body.

656
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:12,310
Did you say...

657
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:15,354
Get rid of the body?

658
00:38:15,354 --> 00:38:18,940
Yeah. It's in both
of our best interest.

659
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:26,031
Get rid of the body.

660
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:28,032
Do you have a better idea?

661
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:33,203
No. I'm not real good
with stuff like this.

662
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:35,706
I don't want to be involved.
I really don't.

663
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:38,166
I don't think I should be
involved in this.

664
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,375
Why not?

665
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,169
Because I can't.
I can't! God! Lord!

666
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:44,922
If you run out on me now,
you're going to force me...

667
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,674
to call your real husband.

668
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:51,428
If you call my husband...

669
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:56,308
I'm calling the police!

670
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:58,184
Yes, I will!

671
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:05,149
Yes... I will.

672
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:18,369
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

673
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,996
All right.
All right...

674
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,085
I know there's
got to be a solution.

675
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,882
A suicide.

676
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:36,219
Lady, don't think like that.

677
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,178
There's got to be
a better way out.

678
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:42,599
Not me!
Him.

679
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,269
He's going to...

680
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:49,313
Know what we can use?

681
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:50,606
These.

682
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:54,902
3L21.

683
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:58,238
21. Go ahead.

684
00:39:58,238 --> 00:40:01,075
We got an emergency call
reporting a fatality...

685
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:03,702
only there's no victim
at the recorded address.

686
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,453
What's the cause of death?

687
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,579
Caller didn't say.
I thought you might want to...

688
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,290
check out the origin
of the call.

689
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,709
The lady seemed pretty upset.

690
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,251
I'll check it out.
What's the address?

691
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:14,211
28 Oak Tree Road.

692
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:41,236
Excuse me, miss.
I'm Captain Meany...

693
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:43,279
with the Summit Bluff police.

694
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:47,157
I knocked on your front door.
You must not have heard me.

695
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:50,995
What's wrong?

696
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:52,787
I'm checking out
an emergency call.

697
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:55,123
It came from your address
about 6:45 tonight.

698
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:56,416
What emergency?

699
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:57,916
Do you live here?

700
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,753
No. My sister
and her husband do.

701
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:00,962
Are they at home?

702
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:04,214
No. They just left.

703
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:06,258
But my sister
should be back soon.

704
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:09,260
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

705
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,221
Only take a couple of minutes.

706
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,472
Sure.

707
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,308
Come in.

708
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:16,934
All right.

709
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,696
Let me see if I've got
everything.

710
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,365
You came over
at approximately 6:30 p. m...

711
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,618
to help your sister cook
for a dinner party...

712
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:40,206
and shortly thereafter,
everyone decided to eat out.

713
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,414
Yeah.

714
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:44,209
Are you sure it's a woman
who made the phone call?

715
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:45,418
Yeah.

716
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,795
Because it definitely wasn't
my sister's in-laws.

717
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:49,422
That family receives
crank calls.

718
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:51,215
They don't make them.

719
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:53,342
That leaves
you and your sister.

720
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:56,219
I know I didn't make
any crank call.

721
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:58,931
And I know my sister would never
make a crank call...

722
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:00,432
believe you me.

723
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:04,519
But I know you probably
can't just take my word for it.

724
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,812
I like to be thorough.

725
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,692
But I'll tell you...

726
00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:14,736
Sometimes I go
on instinct alone.

727
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:17,863
I believe in instinct, too.

728
00:42:17,863 --> 00:42:19,574
It's always right, isn't it?

729
00:42:19,574 --> 00:42:21,575
100% of the time.

730
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:28,499
Thanks for the coffee.

731
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:30,334
It's tea.

732
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:34,212
What? You're kidding.
This is tea?

733
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:35,338
No!

734
00:42:37,214 --> 00:42:39,217
Son of a gun, it is tea!

735
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:42,219
Usually I hate tea,
but this is good.

736
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:43,721
I used two bags.

737
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:45,597
That's your trick.

738
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:47,557
I don't usually cook.

739
00:42:47,557 --> 00:42:51,060
I don't have the time
because I have this career.

740
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:57,482
That's understandable.
Thanks for the...

741
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:05,656
What do you do?

742
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:08,076
I work at Carl's Fish Fair.

743
00:43:08,076 --> 00:43:09,786
I've been there.

744
00:43:09,786 --> 00:43:11,704
I never saw you there.

745
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:14,665
Probably because the day
I was there, you weren't there.

746
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:16,958
Because I'd have remembered you.

747
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:18,502
Thank you.

748
00:43:20,587 --> 00:43:22,380
I gotta go.

749
00:43:25,215 --> 00:43:27,886
You want to make sure
you lock this after I go.

750
00:43:33,182 --> 00:43:34,224
Good night.

751
00:43:34,224 --> 00:43:35,850
Good night, captain.

752
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:55,952
How's this?

753
00:43:55,952 --> 00:43:59,414
"My darkness descends
deeper than I knew it could.

754
00:44:00,748 --> 00:44:05,043
"Enveloped in the blackness,
I search for some light.

755
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:08,965
"Maybe now...
Maybe this time."

756
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:10,298
That's beautiful.

757
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:11,675
You really think so?

758
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:16,136
I was really touched.
I really believed it.

759
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:18,181
Thank you.

760
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,349
I hope everybody else
believes it.

761
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:25,186
They definitely will.

762
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:28,482
Do you think anyone
might recognize the handwriting?

763
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:30,191
No. I wrote like a doctor.

764
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:35,988
Where did you get all of these?

765
00:44:35,988 --> 00:44:37,323
From my husband, the doctor.

766
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,993
He's a doctor?

767
00:44:40,993 --> 00:44:43,161
The whole family...
they're all doctors.

768
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:45,997
They get these
samples of drugs...

769
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:49,333
from these drug companies,
free of charge.

770
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:52,587
I've got a lot of blue ones
in there now...

771
00:44:52,587 --> 00:44:54,671
and a lot of the red ones.

772
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:56,382
You think I ought to...

773
00:44:56,382 --> 00:44:58,134
There's some more white ones.

774
00:44:58,134 --> 00:44:59,843
Yeah, use them all.

775
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:01,720
Just stuff them down there.

776
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:08,101
There they are.

777
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:13,856
All right. I think
that about does it.

778
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:18,360
Good. You have that done,
and I have this, and...

779
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:29,828
Were you absolutely sure
that you got all these deals?

780
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:31,580
What's that?

781
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,873
The protection.

782
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,461
How many were used?

783
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,671
Five.

784
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,423
Five.

785
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,676
Wow!

786
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:49,387
He had been out of the country
for a very, very long time.

787
00:45:49,387 --> 00:45:51,723
I see.

788
00:45:51,723 --> 00:45:54,808
We found four so far.

789
00:45:54,808 --> 00:45:58,646
Oh, rats!
Did you check the shower?

790
00:45:58,646 --> 00:46:01,357
Yes, I already got
the one in the shower.

791
00:46:01,357 --> 00:46:04,525
Already got the shower.
OK, we were...

792
00:46:04,525 --> 00:46:05,736
Shower!

793
00:46:09,614 --> 00:46:11,616
Do you have any idea...

794
00:46:11,616 --> 00:46:15,203
where that fifth one
might have been applied?

795
00:46:15,203 --> 00:46:17,205
Did you check out here
on the balcony?

796
00:46:17,205 --> 00:46:19,081
No, you got that one already.

797
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:22,626
Yeah, I already got that one.
Let me see...

798
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:33,301
Found it!

799
00:46:38,348 --> 00:46:40,559
What? He's still wearing it?

800
00:46:53,361 --> 00:46:56,198
Go ahead. Just...

801
00:46:56,198 --> 00:46:58,658
I'm not taking it off.

802
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:03,120
You certainly can't expect me
to take it off.

803
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,123
You ought to do something...

804
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:08,125
because that's not
a very appropriate thing...

805
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,751
for a suicide.

806
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:14,548
I'm just absolutely not
taking it off.

807
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:18,634
You are more familiar
with him than I am.

808
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:20,595
Yes, but you have
done this before.

809
00:47:20,595 --> 00:47:22,597
I mean, this kind of thing
you have done.

810
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:24,473
Haven't you sort of done this?

811
00:47:24,473 --> 00:47:27,143
I've taken them
off me personally...

812
00:47:27,143 --> 00:47:32,480
but I've never taken them
off another man.

813
00:47:34,024 --> 00:47:37,152
Why don't you pretend
like he's you?

814
00:47:37,152 --> 00:47:40,195
No. This is where
I draw the line.

815
00:47:44,658 --> 00:47:47,952
All right. Fine.
I will do it myself.

816
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:50,163
God, it's no big deal!

817
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:54,250
I sort of think you're acting
like a little bit of a baby.

818
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,212
It's just a body.

819
00:47:57,212 --> 00:48:04,426
A body is just a house
God gives us to live in.

820
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:06,261
That's all our body is.

821
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:09,639
And then we go away
to a different place...

822
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:12,515
and we don't live
in our house anymore.

823
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:15,186
Now, see? There.
Was that any big deal?

824
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,116
Nick.

825
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,116
Will!

826
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:34,119
What are you doing here?

827
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:39,624
I just thought
I'd stop by and say hello.

828
00:48:39,624 --> 00:48:41,626
Say hello?

829
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:45,129
Yeah. I really need
something to drink.

830
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:48,549
And maybe we could
have a little talk.

831
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:51,093
Good. Because I really
need to talk.

832
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:53,595
You need to talk?
You never need to talk.

833
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:56,139
I'm always the one
that needs to talk.

834
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:59,809
Do you got one of those
"not really beers" in here?

835
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,561
It's on the door.

836
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:03,396
Great.

837
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,940
I've earned this tonight.

838
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:12,696
I met a woman tonight.

839
00:49:12,696 --> 00:49:14,656
Yeah?

840
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:20,077
So did I, only I can't
really date this one.

841
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:23,455
We're sort of
in a business deal together...

842
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,541
because of a certain event.

843
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:32,088
I don't know what
she sees in me, but...

844
00:49:32,088 --> 00:49:35,633
we talked for over an hour.

845
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:37,676
She made me feel important.

846
00:49:37,676 --> 00:49:39,303
Who?

847
00:49:39,303 --> 00:49:42,264
The woman I met tonight.

848
00:49:42,264 --> 00:49:45,100
Yeah?
I think you're important.

849
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,601
You think I'm important...

850
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:49,103
because I'm always getting you
out of trouble.

851
00:49:49,103 --> 00:49:50,605
She's different.

852
00:49:50,605 --> 00:49:52,607
She doesn't want
anything from me.

853
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,692
I don't want anything from you.

854
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,110
Just sit down.

855
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:59,154
One of the reasons
why I came over here tonight...

856
00:49:59,154 --> 00:50:01,948
was I wanted
to find out about... tea!

857
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:03,658
You're drinking tea.

858
00:50:03,658 --> 00:50:05,452
Yeah. Tea's good.

859
00:50:05,452 --> 00:50:10,414
This girl is younger than me,
but in a lot of ways...

860
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:12,208
she's more independent
than I am.

861
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,001
She really understands me.

862
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:15,336
I understand you.

863
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:20,215
And I like who I am
when I'm with her.

864
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:27,304
Wilbur, about this
chief-of-police thing...

865
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:33,143
What if something...
minor happened?

866
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:37,146
What's the most minor thing
that could happen...

867
00:50:37,146 --> 00:50:39,315
and you'd still be OK?

868
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:41,651
Are you in trouble again?

869
00:50:41,651 --> 00:50:48,323
No, no!
I was just wondering.

870
00:50:48,323 --> 00:50:49,950
Her name is Jeanine.

871
00:50:51,535 --> 00:50:53,370
I gotta call her.

872
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:57,998
No, I was just wondering if...

873
00:50:57,998 --> 00:50:59,792
I was wondering how much...

874
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:03,629
accidental manslaughter
will hurt your chances.

875
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:04,880
God.

876
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:13,096
When did you find out?

877
00:51:15,597 --> 00:51:17,683
We got the call this morning.

878
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:21,144
Someone from the hotel
housekeeping staff found him.

879
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,647
Why was he staying
in a hotel, anyway?

880
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,565
He was supposed
to stay with us.

881
00:51:25,565 --> 00:51:27,692
I spent over $900...

882
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:31,320
on new slipcovers
for the guest room.

883
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,156
Maybe he was too depressed
to be with anybody.

884
00:51:34,156 --> 00:51:35,907
How would she know?

885
00:51:35,907 --> 00:51:39,077
Marjorie gets depressed
sometimes.

886
00:51:39,077 --> 00:51:43,290
Yeah. Every now and then,
I get a little blue.

887
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,333
What on God's earth did Charles
have to be depressed about?

888
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:50,588
Charles is gone.
I can't believe he's gone!

889
00:51:50,588 --> 00:51:53,507
Why did he do it?

890
00:51:56,134 --> 00:51:59,680
He left this note.

891
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,599
A note?

892
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:09,314
"My darkness descends deeper
than I knew it could."

893
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:15,151
"Enveloped in the blackness,
I search for some light."

894
00:52:18,112 --> 00:52:23,201
"Maybe now...
Maybe this time."

895
00:52:26,286 --> 00:52:29,290
What a beautiful note!

896
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,708
Did you really like the note?

897
00:52:34,127 --> 00:52:36,712
Of course we like the note.

898
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:40,132
What kind of
a question is that?

899
00:52:40,132 --> 00:52:42,801
A very insensitive one!

900
00:52:44,428 --> 00:52:46,679
He should have been here,
where he belonged...

901
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:50,517
with his family
at his coming-home party.

902
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:53,811
Maybe he didn't
want to be here.

903
00:52:55,854 --> 00:52:59,733
I have never seen you
this talkative before!

904
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:01,735
Children, I'm afraid
there are still...

905
00:53:01,735 --> 00:53:05,530
certain details to discuss.

906
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,448
The funeral...

907
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,747
Before we get into that,
I was thinking about...

908
00:53:17,582 --> 00:53:19,417
The organ donation centre...

909
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:21,253
You know what I was thinking?

910
00:53:21,253 --> 00:53:23,630
I was thinking that Charles
would have liked it...

911
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,465
if we donated
his organs to science.

912
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:30,719
Iris, that's
an excellent idea!

913
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:32,638
Harry.

914
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:34,722
Harry?

915
00:53:36,057 --> 00:53:38,060
Do you really think
that's necessary?

916
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,144
Yes.

917
00:53:40,144 --> 00:53:43,481
Yes, I think it's appropriate.

918
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:47,150
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have suggested it.

919
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:51,154
Yes. My Charles
would have liked that.

920
00:53:51,154 --> 00:53:53,240
Thank you, Iris.

921
00:54:16,093 --> 00:54:18,138
Guess what.

922
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:21,390
I met this guy.
I think I really like him.

923
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,642
You always think you like them
for 24 hours.

924
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:27,855
You always do this.

925
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:29,564
Do what?

926
00:54:29,564 --> 00:54:30,773
Whenever
something good happens...

927
00:54:30,773 --> 00:54:33,609
you have to find something bad
to say about me.

928
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:35,027
That's not true.

929
00:54:35,027 --> 00:54:37,488
Then try being happy for me
for once, OK?

930
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:41,867
OK.

931
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:48,414
So, tell me about him.

932
00:54:48,414 --> 00:54:51,751
He's not like the men
I usually date.

933
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:53,585
He has a job?

934
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:56,129
Yeah. And we haven't
known each other that long...

935
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,632
but we talked all night
on the phone.

936
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:01,176
And get this...
he loves fish.

937
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:04,053
Not only that,
but he has a tank.

938
00:55:04,053 --> 00:55:06,890
It's small, but he says
he wants to get a bigger one.

939
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,558
He sounds really committed
to his fish.

940
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:11,560
It's more
than just fish, though.

941
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,728
We're getting
to know each other.

942
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:16,148
He told me about
his two old girlfriends.

943
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:18,274
I'm telling him
about my past relationships.

944
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:22,612
The weirdest thing is,
I owe it all to you.

945
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:24,404
What do you mean?

946
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,908
I met him at your place
last night...

947
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:28,909
and I'm nuts about him.

948
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,827
Last night?

949
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,913
Yeah. After you all left...

950
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:36,542
he came around
investigating a crank call.

951
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:37,751
What?

952
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,461
Does he work
for the telephone company?

953
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:43,713
Nope. He's a cop.

954
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:46,759
Cop? A policeman?

955
00:55:46,759 --> 00:55:49,803
There was a policeman
in my house last night?

956
00:55:49,803 --> 00:55:54,390
Yep. And I am going to be
at his house tonight.

957
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,767
Why didn't you tell me this?

958
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:57,602
I forgot.

959
00:55:57,602 --> 00:55:59,019
Does Harry know?

960
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:01,021
No. I was going to call
you guys and tell you...

961
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:03,064
only Wilbur called...
that's his name, Wilbur...

962
00:56:03,064 --> 00:56:06,110
and we talked all night,
so I thought I'd tell you today.

963
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,735
This is just like you!

964
00:56:07,735 --> 00:56:09,654
It's no big deal.

965
00:56:09,654 --> 00:56:12,240
Only he still
needs to talk to you.

966
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,451
Me? Why?

967
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:17,245
There was
this crank call made...

968
00:56:17,245 --> 00:56:19,913
and he said they traced it
back to your house.

969
00:56:19,913 --> 00:56:22,124
What do you mean
by a crank call?

970
00:56:22,124 --> 00:56:24,458
A 911 call.

971
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,962
Oh, lord.

972
00:56:26,962 --> 00:56:28,921
Don't worry. I told him
it was a mistake.

973
00:56:28,921 --> 00:56:30,631
Did he believe you?

974
00:56:30,631 --> 00:56:32,799
Of course!
Why wouldn't he?

975
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,095
I just knew something like this
was going to happen.

976
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,930
Wilbur needs to talk to you
about this crank call...

977
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,932
on account of he's up
for police chief...

978
00:56:40,932 --> 00:56:43,434
and he wants to cover
all his bases.

979
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:47,479
Only I don't want you to say
anything bad about me, OK?

980
00:56:47,479 --> 00:56:51,150
I really like this guy.
All right?

981
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,734
OK!

982
00:56:52,734 --> 00:56:54,486
What's wrong?

983
00:56:54,486 --> 00:56:56,488
Nothing.

984
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,289
God!

985
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,841
Marjorie?

986
00:57:21,344 --> 00:57:24,013
Marjorie, are you OK?

987
00:57:24,013 --> 00:57:27,807
Yes. I'm just
a little emotional.

988
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:32,353
I missed choir practice
this morning...

989
00:57:32,353 --> 00:57:34,356
and I just hate myself!

990
00:57:34,356 --> 00:57:36,525
I hate to sound
like a broken record...

991
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:39,026
but I know how to cure you
of these moods of yours.

992
00:57:39,026 --> 00:57:41,028
I don't think so.

993
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:44,198
You should get rid of Harry
and have an affair.

994
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,534
As soon as you and Harry
clear things up...

995
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:50,036
then you won't be
so jealous of me.

996
00:57:50,036 --> 00:57:53,873
I am not jealous of you!

997
00:57:53,873 --> 00:57:56,542
Oh, yeah?
Then why are you crying?

998
00:57:56,542 --> 00:58:00,379
I am crying because
Harry's brother died.

999
00:58:00,379 --> 00:58:03,382
Oh, please! You didn't
even know Charles.

1000
00:58:03,382 --> 00:58:04,883
I knew him!

1001
00:58:04,883 --> 00:58:08,678
Right. You knew of him,
but you didn't really know him.

1002
00:58:10,847 --> 00:58:13,850
I really knew him.

1003
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,351
I killed him!

1004
00:58:19,354 --> 00:58:21,522
Marjorie,
do you have your period?

1005
00:58:21,522 --> 00:58:24,860
Are you listening to me,
god damn it?

1006
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,361
You never curse!

1007
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:30,197
Oh, Lord, forgive me.

1008
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:35,536
Now I have two things
to confess in church this week.

1009
00:58:35,536 --> 00:58:37,871
What are you talking about?

1010
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:41,874
I knew him
in the biblical sense.

1011
00:58:41,874 --> 00:58:43,376
What?

1012
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:46,378
I met him, and we did it!

1013
00:58:46,378 --> 00:58:49,381
You had sex
with your brother-in-law?

1014
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:52,759
It was not sex.
It was good!

1015
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:57,138
And, Jeanine... I had one.

1016
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:59,307
One what?

1017
00:58:59,307 --> 00:59:01,349
You know...

1018
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:04,562
I don't believe this!

1019
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:07,397
You said you killed him.
How'd you kill him?

1020
00:59:07,397 --> 00:59:08,857
Sex!

1021
00:59:08,857 --> 00:59:10,775
Sex?

1022
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:15,572
I had an affair
because you told me to!

1023
00:59:20,618 --> 00:59:24,079
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm saying excuse me!

1024
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,080
Marjorie,
this is so bizarre.

1025
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,083
I know. I must have been
too powerful for him.

1026
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:31,585
He had himself a heart attack!

1027
00:59:31,585 --> 00:59:33,087
While you were...

1028
00:59:33,087 --> 00:59:34,130
After!

1029
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:37,466
I think it was after.
I hope it was after.

1030
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:48,601
Howie, is that you?

1031
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:49,602
No.

1032
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:53,105
Iris. And Harry.

1033
00:59:53,105 --> 00:59:54,982
Just checking in.

1034
00:59:54,982 --> 00:59:57,651
You two shouldn't be in here.
This is highly irregular.

1035
00:59:57,651 --> 00:59:58,860
Calm down, Plotner.

1036
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,820
Just going to make sure
our brother is in good hands.

1037
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,739
Yeah, but you shouldn't
be in here. It's unethical.

1038
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:05,533
The chest cavity appears to be
within normal limits.

1039
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:07,868
Do you want to do this?

1040
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:12,581
This is a funny thing.

1041
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:17,168
Must be one
of those pills he took.

1042
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:20,420
There's a whole clump of them
in his oesophagus.

1043
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,423
They didn't get digested.

1044
01:00:22,423 --> 01:00:24,676
None of these got digested.

1045
01:00:24,676 --> 01:00:27,594
What are you doing?
Get out of there!

1046
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:30,680
Look at this.

1047
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,516
Looks like an eraser.

1048
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:34,184
From a pencil.

1049
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:37,019
It's an eraser from a pencil.

1050
01:00:37,019 --> 01:00:39,856
Your brother was a weird guy.

1051
01:00:43,192 --> 01:00:45,527
Plotner, you got a second?

1052
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:47,195
David.

1053
01:00:47,195 --> 01:00:48,697
Oh. Harry.

1054
01:00:48,697 --> 01:00:49,698
Yeah.

1055
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:53,034
Take a look at this.
I don't understand it.

1056
01:00:53,034 --> 01:00:54,494
Charles was
an excellent doctor.

1057
01:00:54,494 --> 01:00:56,036
Why would he
try and kill himself...

1058
01:00:56,036 --> 01:00:58,497
with a thousand milligrams
of stool softener?

1059
01:00:58,497 --> 01:01:00,248
He tried to kill himself
with a laxative?

1060
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:01,834
That and 800 milligrams...

1061
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:03,711
of a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory.

1062
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:06,045
That's for menstrual cramps.

1063
01:01:06,045 --> 01:01:07,130
I know.

1064
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,466
Antihistamines,
aspirins, muscle relaxants...

1065
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:12,177
vitamin tablets...
all in small dosages.

1066
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:14,471
I don't get it.

1067
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:16,972
Your brother...

1068
01:01:16,972 --> 01:01:20,684
wasn't he doing immunization
work in South America?

1069
01:01:20,684 --> 01:01:22,227
Yes.

1070
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:24,896
He was brilliant.

1071
01:01:24,896 --> 01:01:28,274
Then he would have had access
to some very lethal medications.

1072
01:01:28,274 --> 01:01:31,694
I know. So why would he
take that stuff?

1073
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:34,363
It's like he raided
somebody's medicine chest.

1074
01:01:34,363 --> 01:01:36,198
You might as well know.

1075
01:01:36,198 --> 01:01:38,492
I don't think that Charles
committed suicide.

1076
01:01:38,492 --> 01:01:40,202
What?

1077
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:42,496
Harry, why do you say that?

1078
01:01:42,496 --> 01:01:44,997
For one thing, there was
scar tissue on the heart.

1079
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:48,000
That usually indicates
a heart attack.

1080
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,210
Heart attack.

1081
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,171
Also, there were some signs
of sexual activity.

1082
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:58,384
What about the suicide note?

1083
01:01:58,384 --> 01:02:00,386
That's the only thing
I can't understand...

1084
01:02:00,386 --> 01:02:02,347
because the lab reports
came back...

1085
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:04,348
and the drugs that Charles took
are all highly suspect.

1086
01:02:04,348 --> 01:02:07,142
What's wrong
with the drugs he took?

1087
01:02:07,142 --> 01:02:08,769
Can't they kill you?

1088
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:10,687
They'll give you the runs,
numb your ovaries...

1089
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,648
and give you a very relaxed take
on your situation...

1090
01:02:12,648 --> 01:02:14,315
but they won't kill you.

1091
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:17,944
I don't see why you have to
turn this into a police case.

1092
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:19,445
Charles is dead.

1093
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:22,824
Why don't you just let it be
and bury the man?

1094
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:24,449
I can't, Marjorie.
I can't bury him...

1095
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,368
until I find out
what happened.

1096
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,170
Hi, Jeanine.

1097
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,672
Hi. How you doing?

1098
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,173
Good. Come on in.

1099
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:42,675
I brought you something.

1100
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,175
You didn't have to
bring anything.

1101
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:45,468
I made a whole dinner.

1102
01:02:45,468 --> 01:02:48,179
No, it's not food.
It's a scavenger.

1103
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:50,682
Take care of
any algae problems.

1104
01:02:50,682 --> 01:02:52,183
Where's your tank?

1105
01:02:52,183 --> 01:02:54,143
Right over there.
It's a bowl, actually.

1106
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:55,644
A scavenger, huh?

1107
01:02:55,644 --> 01:02:58,689
That's great, because sometimes
I get a little algae.

1108
01:02:58,689 --> 01:03:00,190
A little?

1109
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,192
That's very sweet of you.

1110
01:03:02,192 --> 01:03:04,694
This guy's going to have
a good time tonight.

1111
01:03:04,694 --> 01:03:06,279
I'm just going
to float him.

1112
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:08,990
Let him get used
to the temperature.

1113
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:10,616
Where's your brother?

1114
01:03:10,616 --> 01:03:13,618
I don't know. I don't even know
if he's coming.

1115
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:16,163
But dinner's all ready.
Maybe we should just eat.

1116
01:03:16,163 --> 01:03:17,956
Relax.
He's just a little late.

1117
01:03:17,956 --> 01:03:20,542
Besides, I like it
when we're alone together.

1118
01:03:23,627 --> 01:03:27,631
I wanted you to meet
my brother up front.

1119
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:29,175
Here, sit down.

1120
01:03:29,175 --> 01:03:31,635
I didn't want you to think...

1121
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:34,637
that I was keeping
anything from you.

1122
01:03:34,637 --> 01:03:37,640
What would you
be keeping from me?

1123
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,642
My brother.

1124
01:03:39,642 --> 01:03:41,186
What's wrong with him?

1125
01:03:41,186 --> 01:03:42,645
Nothing.
It's just that...

1126
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:46,190
sometimes he has a hard time
holding onto a job...

1127
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,649
or paying a bill.

1128
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:49,193
I love spaghetti.

1129
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:50,652
It's my specialty.

1130
01:03:50,652 --> 01:03:53,654
It's not that
my brother is lazy.

1131
01:03:53,654 --> 01:03:56,199
It's just that he isn't...

1132
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,868
Isn't as accomplished as you?

1133
01:03:57,868 --> 01:03:59,327
That's not it.

1134
01:03:59,327 --> 01:04:02,413
Actually, I wish
he was more like you.

1135
01:04:02,413 --> 01:04:03,663
Do you know that...

1136
01:04:03,663 --> 01:04:06,625
you're the most independent
woman I've ever met...

1137
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,418
that liked me back.

1138
01:04:08,418 --> 01:04:11,129
I know what it's like...

1139
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:13,631
to be following
in someone's footsteps...

1140
01:04:13,631 --> 01:04:16,133
who is always doing
the right thing...

1141
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:19,136
and constantly being judged
by their standards.

1142
01:04:19,136 --> 01:04:22,139
Maybe I am judging him
by my standards.

1143
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:24,432
I'm sure your brother
would love to be like you...

1144
01:04:24,432 --> 01:04:26,351
but it doesn't sound
like he is.

1145
01:04:26,351 --> 01:04:29,270
That's it. For years,
I've hated feeling...

1146
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:31,272
like I had to take
care of him.

1147
01:04:31,272 --> 01:04:34,066
Don't take care of him.
Just be his brother.

1148
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:38,654
You're right.
That's what I've got to do.

1149
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:41,240
Let's eat.

1150
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,158
You don't really need
to meet my brother.

1151
01:04:44,158 --> 01:04:47,662
Just like you don't really have
to meet my sister.

1152
01:04:51,165 --> 01:04:52,499
Feed me.

1153
01:04:52,499 --> 01:04:54,668
Yes, ma'am.

1154
01:04:54,668 --> 01:04:57,171
You want sausage,
or do you want meatballs?

1155
01:04:57,171 --> 01:04:58,171
Both.

1156
01:04:58,171 --> 01:04:59,422
You got it.

1157
01:04:59,422 --> 01:05:01,174
Wilbur...

1158
01:05:01,174 --> 01:05:05,594
what's your feeling
on this prank call?

1159
01:05:05,594 --> 01:05:08,055
Your gut feeling?

1160
01:05:08,055 --> 01:05:09,598
It's nothing, I guess.

1161
01:05:09,598 --> 01:05:15,270
Wilbur, go with your gut.
Remember how often it's right.

1162
01:05:24,278 --> 01:05:26,071
Wilbur?

1163
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,407
Wilbur?

1164
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:33,411
Yeah. I'm sorry to wake you,
but I'm in jail.

1165
01:05:33,411 --> 01:05:34,871
I've turned myself in.

1166
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:36,038
What for?

1167
01:05:37,582 --> 01:05:39,083
I killed a man.

1168
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:40,460
What?

1169
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,296
It was by accident,
but he's dead.

1170
01:05:44,296 --> 01:05:45,589
Dead?

1171
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:47,090
What? What is it?

1172
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:48,592
It's nothing.

1173
01:05:48,592 --> 01:05:50,594
Did you say that you...

1174
01:05:50,594 --> 01:05:51,927
Yeah.

1175
01:05:51,927 --> 01:05:55,598
I was in a hotel room
doing an installation...

1176
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:57,099
and things went bad.

1177
01:05:57,099 --> 01:05:58,767
Oh, my god.
The hotel room.

1178
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:00,102
That's my prank call!

1179
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:03,104
The man's name
was Charles Turner.

1180
01:06:03,104 --> 01:06:04,564
I didn't even know him.

1181
01:06:04,564 --> 01:06:08,693
Oh, my god! You?
That was you?

1182
01:06:08,693 --> 01:06:10,403
I need a lawyer,
if you know any.

1183
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:12,404
I hate to keep
leaning on you...

1184
01:06:12,404 --> 01:06:15,240
but I don't know how I'm going
to find one from in here.

1185
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,117
Yeah, yeah.
I'll take care of it.

1186
01:06:17,117 --> 01:06:18,535
Great.

1187
01:06:18,535 --> 01:06:24,040
Will, I'm sorry.
When I get out of here...

1188
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,043
after I've served my time...

1189
01:06:26,043 --> 01:06:28,753
I'm going to be
the greatest salesman ever...

1190
01:06:28,753 --> 01:06:32,339
and I'm going to pay you back
all the money I owe you.

1191
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:33,548
OK?

1192
01:06:33,548 --> 01:06:35,050
OK.

1193
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:37,469
I love you, Will.

1194
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:39,054
Yeah. Right.

1195
01:06:48,062 --> 01:06:50,064
I know who killed Charles.

1196
01:06:50,064 --> 01:06:51,564
You do?

1197
01:06:51,564 --> 01:06:53,066
This is very difficult.

1198
01:06:53,066 --> 01:06:57,570
Look, Wilbur, this has nothing
to do with us. Really.

1199
01:06:57,570 --> 01:07:00,573
I know you're nothing
like your brother...

1200
01:07:00,573 --> 01:07:03,575
just like I'm nothing
like my sister. Nothing at all.

1201
01:07:03,575 --> 01:07:05,078
Jeanine...

1202
01:07:05,078 --> 01:07:07,079
I know, but it was
an accident.

1203
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:09,331
There's a lot
at stake here, Wilbur.

1204
01:07:09,331 --> 01:07:11,457
How do you know?
You don't even know Nick.

1205
01:07:11,457 --> 01:07:12,458
Nick?

1206
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:14,085
My brother.
He killed Charles.

1207
01:07:14,085 --> 01:07:15,129
What?

1208
01:07:15,129 --> 01:07:18,089
It was an accident.
He turned himself in.

1209
01:07:18,089 --> 01:07:20,550
That's why he didn't
show up for dinner.

1210
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:24,094
He's in jail.
My little brother's in jail.

1211
01:07:24,094 --> 01:07:29,933
Wait a minute, now.
Just calm down, Wilbur.

1212
01:07:29,933 --> 01:07:31,976
I got to get a lawyer
and get him out.

1213
01:07:31,976 --> 01:07:33,978
He can't stay in jail.
He's not streetwise.

1214
01:07:33,978 --> 01:07:36,480
He could get killed in there.

1215
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,691
How did you know
it was an accident?

1216
01:07:40,109 --> 01:07:43,111
I don't know.
I just thought...

1217
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:46,614
I don't know.
You said that it was.

1218
01:07:46,614 --> 01:07:49,117
I got to find a lawyer.

1219
01:07:49,117 --> 01:07:50,618
What about you?

1220
01:07:50,618 --> 01:07:53,120
What about becoming
chief of police?

1221
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,498
Five minutes ago, I wanted to be
chief of police...

1222
01:07:55,498 --> 01:07:57,332
more than anything
else in the world.

1223
01:07:57,332 --> 01:07:59,334
All the times
that he needed help...

1224
01:07:59,334 --> 01:08:01,002
I helped him because
I felt I had to.

1225
01:08:01,002 --> 01:08:02,086
Now I want to!

1226
01:08:02,086 --> 01:08:04,006
I don't care
if he did it or not.

1227
01:08:04,006 --> 01:08:05,923
He's my brother.
Screw the job.

1228
01:08:12,554 --> 01:08:14,265
Harry?

1229
01:08:14,265 --> 01:08:15,557
Yeah?

1230
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,604
Honey, where have you
been all night?

1231
01:08:21,604 --> 01:08:24,900
At the lab, and then
at the police station.

1232
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,903
What were you doing
at the police station?

1233
01:08:28,903 --> 01:08:30,361
Is there any coffee?

1234
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:31,362
Yeah.

1235
01:08:33,031 --> 01:08:34,408
Anybody home?

1236
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:35,492
In here.

1237
01:08:35,492 --> 01:08:37,577
What are they doing here?

1238
01:08:37,577 --> 01:08:38,953
I've called a family meeting.

1239
01:08:38,953 --> 01:08:40,370
What for?

1240
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,122
Your front door was open.

1241
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:43,207
So?

1242
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:44,626
Do you want coffee?

1243
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:45,751
Sure.

1244
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:46,710
Please.

1245
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:51,923
Don't move.
I'll make it.

1246
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:54,426
This isn't going
to take long, I hope.

1247
01:08:54,426 --> 01:08:56,803
I've got two back-to-back
pap smears at 9:00.

1248
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:58,930
No, it's not.
I just want to wait...

1249
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:01,139
until mother and dad get here
to explain.

1250
01:09:01,139 --> 01:09:03,351
I don't want to have
to say it twice.

1251
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:06,311
Your front door is open.

1252
01:09:06,311 --> 01:09:09,648
Iris left it open.

1253
01:09:09,648 --> 01:09:12,441
What's the big news?

1254
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:15,945
Sit down.

1255
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,575
I've been working
with the police...

1256
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:25,578
on Charles' case,
as you all probably know, and...

1257
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,790
We've found a murder suspect.

1258
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,087
You did?

1259
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,588
Who was it?

1260
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:38,173
A salesman.

1261
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:41,426
What kind of a salesman
would kill Charles?

1262
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:43,929
A blinds salesman.

1263
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:45,263
How could a blind salesman...

1264
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:47,974
No, he sold blinds, dad...

1265
01:09:47,974 --> 01:09:51,268
and he dropped them
on Charles' head.

1266
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,397
He claims it was an accident.

1267
01:09:55,397 --> 01:09:56,565
Oh, lord!

1268
01:09:56,565 --> 01:09:57,899
How do you know all this?

1269
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:01,610
He turned himself in, confessed.
He even apologized.

1270
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,113
He confessed?

1271
01:10:03,113 --> 01:10:04,530
Yeah.

1272
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:06,031
What about the suicide?

1273
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:08,117
This guy said he panicked...

1274
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:10,034
and set it up to look
like Charles killed himself.

1275
01:10:10,034 --> 01:10:12,580
Oh, my lord!
He said that?

1276
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:17,125
Harry said he confessed.
That's what confessed means.

1277
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,626
I knew it.

1278
01:10:18,626 --> 01:10:21,462
I knew my Charles would never
take his own life.

1279
01:10:23,214 --> 01:10:25,841
Marjorie, I've got to
talk to you alone!

1280
01:10:25,841 --> 01:10:27,426
Jeanine, not now.

1281
01:10:27,426 --> 01:10:29,260
My boyfriend's brother
is in jail.

1282
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,928
Jeanine, I said not now!

1283
01:10:30,928 --> 01:10:33,182
He is in jail
for killing Charles!

1284
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,267
Wait.

1285
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:38,519
Wait.
What are you saying?

1286
01:10:38,519 --> 01:10:40,771
That your boyfriend's brother
killed my brother?

1287
01:10:41,856 --> 01:10:44,441
Wait a minute. Your boyfriend
is Nick's brother?

1288
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:46,443
Nick? I didn't
say his name.

1289
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:48,695
- How do you know his name?
- How do you know Nick?

1290
01:10:48,695 --> 01:10:50,571
I always thought
she was too sweet...

1291
01:10:50,571 --> 01:10:52,074
not to be hiding
something.

1292
01:10:52,074 --> 01:10:54,617
Wilbur was up
for chief of police, OK?

1293
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,453
That's why Nick
couldn't go to the police.

1294
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:58,912
How do you know Nick?

1295
01:10:58,912 --> 01:11:01,290
Nick is in jail.
He could be there for years.

1296
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,125
Obviously where he belongs.

1297
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:08,046
Marjorie, you got to help me.
Wilbur's a wreck.

1298
01:11:08,046 --> 01:11:11,049
I can't stand
to see him like this.

1299
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:13,009
You love him, don't you?

1300
01:11:14,885 --> 01:11:18,013
Yeah, I do.

1301
01:11:18,013 --> 01:11:20,681
I really think
that you should leave.

1302
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:25,061
Harry, I have something
to tell you...

1303
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:26,646
privately.

1304
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:28,064
What is it?

1305
01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:30,608
Harry, I need to talk
to you alone.

1306
01:11:30,608 --> 01:11:32,235
If you have something to say,
just say it now.

1307
01:11:32,235 --> 01:11:33,902
Harry, I need to talk
to you by yourself!

1308
01:11:33,902 --> 01:11:34,903
Just tell me!

1309
01:11:34,903 --> 01:11:36,029
I can't!

1310
01:11:36,029 --> 01:11:38,156
There should be no secrets
in this family!

1311
01:11:38,156 --> 01:11:40,032
God damn it, what is it?

1312
01:11:40,032 --> 01:11:41,910
I had an affair!

1313
01:11:52,586 --> 01:11:54,546
Harry, I'm sorry.

1314
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:01,261
I'm sorry from the bottom
of my soul.

1315
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:02,929
I'm sorry.

1316
01:12:02,929 --> 01:12:04,430
You're sorry?

1317
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,807
Sorry is just not good enough
for my brother!

1318
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:10,144
I knew it... from the day
he brought her home.

1319
01:12:10,144 --> 01:12:14,021
Harry... I wish
I could take it away.

1320
01:12:14,021 --> 01:12:17,400
I know how much
this hurts you.

1321
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,151
Who was it?

1322
01:12:21,529 --> 01:12:24,281
I only slept with him once.

1323
01:12:29,034 --> 01:12:30,537
Just once.

1324
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:35,416
But it...

1325
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:40,713
It apparently made
quite an impact on him.

1326
01:12:40,713 --> 01:12:42,798
You were right about her.

1327
01:12:42,798 --> 01:12:44,257
Throw her out, Harry.

1328
01:12:44,257 --> 01:12:46,050
You don't have to
put up with this!

1329
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:47,968
God damn it, Marjorie!
I'll kill him!

1330
01:12:47,968 --> 01:12:49,052
Harry, don't.

1331
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:50,764
If I were you, Harry,
I'd kill both of them!

1332
01:12:50,764 --> 01:12:53,766
Let her go, son.
She's not worth it!

1333
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:55,642
Who is he?

1334
01:12:55,642 --> 01:12:58,352
Harry, can't we talk
about this alone?

1335
01:12:58,352 --> 01:13:00,481
No! Who is he?

1336
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:01,857
Who is he?

1337
01:13:01,857 --> 01:13:03,983
Was.

1338
01:13:03,983 --> 01:13:05,777
What does she mean "was"?

1339
01:13:05,777 --> 01:13:07,861
Are you telling me it's over?
Is that it?

1340
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:09,614
He's out of your life now?

1341
01:13:09,614 --> 01:13:10,615
She'll do it again.

1342
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:13,658
If they do it once,
they always do it a second time.

1343
01:13:13,658 --> 01:13:15,994
That god damn son of a bitch!
Who is he? Who is he?

1344
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:20,499
Charles.

1345
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:24,418
Charles is the man I slept with.

1346
01:13:25,628 --> 01:13:27,338
My brother Charles?

1347
01:13:27,338 --> 01:13:30,508
She slept with my Charles?

1348
01:13:31,592 --> 01:13:33,176
I don't believe it.

1349
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:36,137
I thought you told me
Charles was dead.

1350
01:13:36,137 --> 01:13:38,347
He is dead!

1351
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:40,266
That's disgusting!

1352
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:42,143
No, no!

1353
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,853
He died when we were doing...

1354
01:13:46,897 --> 01:13:48,899
I don't think
we should be hearing this.

1355
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:51,110
Yes. Yes, we should.

1356
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,652
But the note.

1357
01:13:52,652 --> 01:13:54,612
Charles left
that beautiful note.

1358
01:13:54,612 --> 01:13:57,115
I wrote the note.

1359
01:13:57,115 --> 01:13:58,366
You?

1360
01:13:59,492 --> 01:14:00,535
Why?

1361
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:03,662
Because I didn't
want Harry to find out.

1362
01:14:03,662 --> 01:14:06,081
Because the second I did it...

1363
01:14:06,081 --> 01:14:09,084
I knew I'd made
a horrible mistake...

1364
01:14:09,084 --> 01:14:11,211
and I didn't want to lose him.

1365
01:14:11,211 --> 01:14:13,587
Of course you'd lose him,
you... slut!

1366
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:15,047
Shut up, Iris!
Just shut up!

1367
01:14:16,173 --> 01:14:18,509
All of you! This is between
me and my wife!

1368
01:14:18,509 --> 01:14:20,886
You're one of us, son!
She isn't.

1369
01:14:20,886 --> 01:14:22,887
This concerns
all of us, Harry.

1370
01:14:22,887 --> 01:14:25,849
She isn't.
She's never been one of us.

1371
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:29,561
Shut up!

1372
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:30,812
Shut up. Shut up!

1373
01:14:33,021 --> 01:14:34,606
Now get the hell
out of my house!

1374
01:14:36,108 --> 01:14:40,279
Are you asking us
to leave your house?

1375
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:41,946
Yes, mother.

1376
01:14:43,281 --> 01:14:44,907
Well!

1377
01:14:44,907 --> 01:14:47,159
I don't want to be here.

1378
01:14:50,413 --> 01:14:54,624
We're due at the hospital...
where we're wanted.

1379
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,131
Iris!

1380
01:15:01,131 --> 01:15:02,131
Come on.

1381
01:15:07,595 --> 01:15:10,598
Marjorie, I'm so sorry.

1382
01:15:10,598 --> 01:15:13,558
Are you going to be OK?

1383
01:15:14,726 --> 01:15:16,560
I'll call you later.

1384
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,562
Bye.

1385
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:24,610
Harry...

1386
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,904
can't you forgive me?

1387
01:15:29,615 --> 01:15:32,075
How many others were there
besides my brother?

1388
01:15:33,451 --> 01:15:34,994
None!

1389
01:15:34,994 --> 01:15:36,913
And the first guy
who comes along...

1390
01:15:36,913 --> 01:15:38,831
you do it to him to death?

1391
01:15:44,628 --> 01:15:46,630
Eight years!

1392
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,841
Eight years of marriage,
I have been faithful.

1393
01:15:49,841 --> 01:15:53,636
How did you think...
How could you possibly think...

1394
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:55,638
that you could keep this
hidden from me?

1395
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:59,642
Were you waiting for some
special opportunity to tell me?

1396
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:01,142
Like my birthday?

1397
01:16:01,142 --> 01:16:03,395
Do you think I haven't
had opportunities?

1398
01:16:03,395 --> 01:16:05,230
Because, boy, have I had...

1399
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:06,981
There have been women
I've never even told you about.

1400
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:09,317
They're everywhere.
The way they look at me...

1401
01:16:09,317 --> 01:16:12,069
in my waiting room,
outside the E.R.

1402
01:16:12,069 --> 01:16:15,572
Two years ago, at the colon
convention in Atlanta...

1403
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:19,326
a blonde haematologist
put her room key in my hand.

1404
01:16:19,326 --> 01:16:22,078
Suite 1404.
And I gave it back!

1405
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,621
Was I stupid!

1406
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:26,165
What are you doing?

1407
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,835
What? You think
you're going to leave me?

1408
01:16:28,835 --> 01:16:31,086
I'm not going
to let you leave me.

1409
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,463
I'm leaving you!

1410
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,468
Harry did leave me.

1411
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,845
The truth is,
it didn't matter who left whom.

1412
01:16:40,845 --> 01:16:43,097
I was alone,
and I was scared.

1413
01:16:43,097 --> 01:16:44,515
Marjorie.

1414
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,103
My sister suggested
I see a doctor.

1415
01:16:49,103 --> 01:16:52,021
Maybe you ought to go
see a doctor, huh?

1416
01:16:54,107 --> 01:16:57,610
That was really
the wrong thing to say.

1417
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:00,612
I was desperate
to talk to Harry...

1418
01:17:00,612 --> 01:17:04,616
to tell him the truth about
what I did and why I did it...

1419
01:17:04,616 --> 01:17:07,619
and how sorry I really was
and that I loved him.

1420
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:09,621
I found myself
in a full-blown depression.

1421
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:11,539
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't eat.

1422
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:13,458
I couldn't stop
thinking about Harry.

1423
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:16,627
I didn't know where he was.

1424
01:17:16,627 --> 01:17:19,422
Harry hadn't just
disappeared from my life...

1425
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:22,424
but with a few deft turns
of a screwdriver...

1426
01:17:22,424 --> 01:17:25,469
he disappeared
from his family's life, too.

1427
01:17:25,469 --> 01:17:27,888
I used to worry a lot about
Nick, but I didn't have to.

1428
01:17:27,888 --> 01:17:29,389
His dream came true...

1429
01:17:29,389 --> 01:17:31,223
in the same room
where his nightmare began.

1430
01:17:31,223 --> 01:17:32,558
Mr. Diamond, I'm sorry.

1431
01:17:32,558 --> 01:17:33,893
But we haven't
been able to rent 402...

1432
01:17:33,893 --> 01:17:35,394
since this scandal started.

1433
01:17:35,394 --> 01:17:37,396
Of course you haven't.
Would you want to sleep...

1434
01:17:37,396 --> 01:17:39,356
in a bed where a stiff slept?

1435
01:17:39,356 --> 01:17:40,732
No. It's god damn creepy.

1436
01:17:40,732 --> 01:17:42,108
Get the god damn door
open, you fool.

1437
01:17:42,108 --> 01:17:44,653
What the hell
is going on here?

1438
01:17:44,653 --> 01:17:46,154
Who the hell is that?

1439
01:17:46,154 --> 01:17:48,656
I don't know, Mr. Diamond.

1440
01:17:48,656 --> 01:17:51,617
Just what do you think
you're doing up there?

1441
01:17:51,617 --> 01:17:55,120
I was just getting my blinds...

1442
01:17:56,663 --> 01:17:58,165
Put up here.

1443
01:17:58,165 --> 01:18:01,667
I heard there was
a tragedy in the room...

1444
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:05,046
and I thought that it might
freshen it up a bit.

1445
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,674
What do you think?

1446
01:18:08,674 --> 01:18:11,385
You sold the Sheraton?

1447
01:18:11,385 --> 01:18:14,180
I told you I'd do it
if you gave me enough time.

1448
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,889
Sit down.

1449
01:18:15,889 --> 01:18:17,891
You're having lunch with me!

1450
01:18:19,309 --> 01:18:22,603
Nick really did turn out
to be a top-notch salesman...

1451
01:18:22,603 --> 01:18:26,440
and I've got a house
full of blinds to prove it.

1452
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,609
Wilbur became chief of police.

1453
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:32,612
My sister found herself
in a relationship...

1454
01:18:32,612 --> 01:18:35,615
that lasted
way more than 24 hours.

1455
01:18:35,615 --> 01:18:38,118
I knew it was serious...

1456
01:18:38,118 --> 01:18:41,245
when she moved her
10-gallon tank into his house.

1457
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:46,625
As for me, I couldn't control
my feelings anymore.

1458
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:49,502
So I tried to contain
them on paper...

1459
01:18:56,134 --> 01:18:59,511
After I figured out
how to use a typewriter.

1460
01:19:07,102 --> 01:19:10,354
Six months passed before I
realized I hadn't lost my mind.

1461
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:13,650
I never thought I would be able
to be alone and be OK...

1462
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:15,109
but I was.

1463
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:16,944
I am good!

1464
01:19:16,944 --> 01:19:19,946
When I finished writing,
I let Jeanine read it.

1465
01:19:25,618 --> 01:19:27,120
She loved it.

1466
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,122
I love it!
This is so good!

1467
01:19:30,122 --> 01:19:31,999
She really loved it.

1468
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:35,377
I wasn't sure anyone else
would like it the way she did...

1469
01:19:35,377 --> 01:19:38,130
but Jeanine was positive
it could get published...

1470
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:41,382
so I just let her take care
of the details.

1471
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:43,635
The tables
had really turned...

1472
01:19:43,635 --> 01:19:45,970
because now she was
giving me career advice.

1473
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:49,306
I waited patiently
for some response to my work.

1474
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:53,186
Finally, I got my first call.

1475
01:19:58,148 --> 01:19:59,148
Hello?

1476
01:19:59,148 --> 01:20:00,149
Hi.

1477
01:20:00,149 --> 01:20:01,275
Who's this?

1478
01:20:01,275 --> 01:20:02,569
It's me. Harry.

1479
01:20:04,153 --> 01:20:05,154
Oh!

1480
01:20:05,154 --> 01:20:07,615
Wow! You sound different.

1481
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:09,032
I'm...

1482
01:20:10,367 --> 01:20:12,703
I'm older.
I had a birthday.

1483
01:20:12,703 --> 01:20:15,288
Yeah. I got you a card.

1484
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:17,248
I didn't get it.

1485
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:19,083
I didn't mail it.

1486
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:20,084
Oh.

1487
01:20:21,877 --> 01:20:25,839
Listen, I read your thing.

1488
01:20:25,839 --> 01:20:27,383
What thing?

1489
01:20:27,383 --> 01:20:29,175
Your story.

1490
01:20:29,175 --> 01:20:33,721
You know..."Still Life
in Summit Bluff."

1491
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:35,848
How did you get ahold of...

1492
01:20:35,848 --> 01:20:38,184
Jeanine thought
I should read it.

1493
01:20:38,184 --> 01:20:40,227
That little bitch.

1494
01:20:40,227 --> 01:20:41,395
Bitch?

1495
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:43,189
You never swore.

1496
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:46,441
I'm doing a lot of things
that I never did before.

1497
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:48,401
I am, too.

1498
01:20:48,401 --> 01:20:51,947
By the way, I finally
took your advice.

1499
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:54,073
You opened your own practice?

1500
01:20:54,073 --> 01:20:56,450
In Sausalito. I'm even
making house calls now.

1501
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:58,702
That's great!

1502
01:20:58,702 --> 01:21:00,578
Yeah.

1503
01:21:00,578 --> 01:21:01,956
Harry?

1504
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:03,540
Yeah?

1505
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:07,919
What did you think of my story?

1506
01:21:07,919 --> 01:21:09,420
I loved it.

1507
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,629
You did?

1508
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:12,841
Yeah, I did,
especially that part...

1509
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:15,134
where the idiot doctor
neglected his wife...

1510
01:21:15,134 --> 01:21:18,344
and drove her into the arms
of his cousin.

1511
01:21:18,344 --> 01:21:20,680
I mean, that part...

1512
01:21:23,141 --> 01:21:24,308
Marjorie...

1513
01:21:24,308 --> 01:21:25,852
Yeah?

1514
01:21:25,852 --> 01:21:28,353
I owe you an apology.

1515
01:21:28,353 --> 01:21:30,147
You owe me?

1516
01:21:30,147 --> 01:21:31,649
Yeah.

1517
01:21:31,649 --> 01:21:34,735
Harry, I betrayed you.
I had the affair.

1518
01:21:34,735 --> 01:21:37,195
I wasn't much of a husband.

1519
01:21:37,195 --> 01:21:40,489
I know, but I could have
said something.

1520
01:21:40,489 --> 01:21:42,409
I probably wouldn't
have heard you.

1521
01:21:42,409 --> 01:21:44,452
I guess it's just lucky
you finally wrote it.

1522
01:21:44,452 --> 01:21:47,996
Yeah. It's getting
terrific response.

1523
01:21:47,996 --> 01:21:49,664
I'm not surprised.

1524
01:21:49,664 --> 01:21:52,043
Who have you heard from?

1525
01:21:53,334 --> 01:21:54,419
You.

1526
01:21:56,337 --> 01:21:57,671
Marjorie, do you think...

1527
01:21:57,671 --> 01:22:00,174
that maybe
we could get together...

1528
01:22:00,174 --> 01:22:02,177
and talk about things?

1529
01:22:06,305 --> 01:22:09,140
I guess so.

1530
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,517
When?

1531
01:22:14,145 --> 01:22:15,605
Soon.

1532
01:22:18,315 --> 01:22:20,150
Soon.

1533
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:23,653
Can I call you?

1534
01:22:23,653 --> 01:22:26,156
Yeah, sure, if you want to.

1535
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:29,116
OK, then... I'll call you.

1536
01:22:30,494 --> 01:22:31,495
OK.

1537
01:22:35,331 --> 01:22:36,415
Bye.

1538
01:22:36,415 --> 01:22:37,499
Bye.

1539
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:42,170
Marjorie!

1540
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:47,800
Harry?

1541
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,178
You said I could call.

1542
01:23:04,023 --> 01:23:05,441
I like your beard.

1543
01:23:05,441 --> 01:23:07,275
Thanks.

1544
01:23:07,275 --> 01:23:09,946
You look like
you did in school.

1545
01:23:12,114 --> 01:23:13,699
So do you.

1546
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:20,872
Can I come in?

1547
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:22,873
Yeah.

1548
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,875
Yeah.

1549
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,172
Harry...

1550
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:34,050
Yeah?

1551
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:36,011
How's your heart?
