1
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:44,844
Willard! Bring in
the videocassette recorder.

2
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:25,510
Suddenly, l realized that,
l don't have a pension plan...

3
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:29,305
...l don't have a health plan,
l don't have a dental plan...

4
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,015
...l don't have....

5
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,028
Willard!

6
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,789
Where the hell is my blue hat?

7
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:39,125
l don't know, Miss Crock.

8
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,879
Do you expect me to go
to my 10:00 meeting, like this?

9
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,466
No. Absolutely not, Miss Crock.

10
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,259
l'll help you find it.

11
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,519
l'm cold!

12
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,440
You taking a coffee break, lazybones?

13
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:05,276
All right, it's a good job.

14
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,738
l should have known it was you.

15
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:25,630
Miss Crock, you have such an appreciation
of fine clothing...

16
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:28,424
...l was thinking it was time
you buy me a new uniform.

17
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,678
You lookjust fine to me, Willard.

18
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,805
And you're dismissed.

19
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,890
But, it's disintegrating.

20
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,267
The buttons are barely hanging on.

21
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:40,645
Willard, that is a terrific suit.

22
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:44,065
Your father worked for me for 30 years.
Wore that suit every day.

23
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:45,608
Never complained!

24
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,193
Yeah, and then he died.

25
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:50,989
And then, at the funeral, you made
the undertaker give it back to you...

26
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,741
...so you could stick me in it
for another 15 years.

27
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:55,994
Just what are you implying?

28
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:01,708
Miss Crock, it's Christmas time.
l'm only asking for a new uniform.

29
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,960
''Only'' a new uniform?

30
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:07,422
And pretty soon it'll be
''only'' a new broom, maybe.

31
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,718
And before you know it,
l will be ''only'' bankrupt!

32
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,638
Now, would you please
get out of my sight...

33
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,517
...before l kick you in the ass?

34
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,285
lt's not my fault
you have frost on your strawberries.

35
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:39,579
We have a contract.

36
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,958
Well then, l'll see you in court.

37
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,294
Excuse me, ma'am.

38
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,921
-l've got the Danish.
-Okay.

39
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:50,757
Bring 'em in.

40
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,259
Miss Crock, l'd like you to meet...

41
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:57,555
...Gunn Froling, Erland Vetterlund,
Per Malmsjo and Bertil Guve.

42
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,932
The executive team
from Copenhagen Snak Food.

43
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:04,312
Well, l'm just flattered that you're
even considering my little factory.

44
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,230
Lovely output.

45
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:09,275
That's terrific, Gunn.
You are truly a Great Dane.

46
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:17,200
Come, gentlemen, l'd like to show you
the Bun room. l'm sure you'll love it.

47
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,120
lt's just past Jellies and Creams.

48
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,456
What a bunch of bores!

49
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,376
l never know what those guys are saying.

50
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,128
Never mind about that.
Do you think we've got a deal?

51
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,422
Does Big Boy have a weight problem?

52
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:34,592
Soon you're going to be
the richest, prettiest...

53
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:38,930
...sexiest lady in the entire pastry industry.

54
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:41,015
l've told you, Chip...

55
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,893
...not in the office.

56
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,040
Hey, guys.

57
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,088
Nothing says Christmas Eve
like some hot, spicy chicken wings.

58
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,798
All right!

59
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,595
lf they're so yummy, how come
you only show up when it's free?

60
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:21,931
There he is.

61
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,849
About time!

62
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:26,060
Can you believe it? The old prune
made me clean her chimney.

63
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:28,771
Like she thinks Santa's coming
to pay her a visit.

64
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:35,278
Now, look here. Be careful with this
'cause it's kind of strong.

65
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:42,744
Willard, you need to make
a New Year's resolution.

66
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:44,954
Quit working for the ball-buster.

67
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,082
Show her who's boss, man.
Take a shit in her soup.

68
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,418
Thanks. That's real constructive.

69
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:53,713
You know how things are today.
A man has a job, he holds onto it.

70
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,257
ln your case, till he dies of old age.

71
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:58,468
Yeah, like my old man.

72
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:02,639
You know what he said to me
on his deathbed?

73
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,683
He said, ''Stick with Miss Crock.
You'll get ahead.''

74
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,186
l don't know what he was talking about.

75
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:11,564
Merry Christmas, Willard.

76
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:14,484
Merry Christmas, Rusty.

77
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,944
''Good King Wenceslas looked out

78
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,447
''On the Feast of Stephen''

79
00:07:19,614 --> 00:07:21,407
Oh, Chip...

80
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:23,951
...it's beautiful!

81
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,912
Now open yours.

82
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,039
l'm so excited.

83
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:32,001
Oh, Virginia, what a sweet gift!

84
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,838
l know how much you like money.
lt's $50,000.

85
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,383
You can buy anything you want with it.

86
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:43,137
What are you standing around for, Willard?

87
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,808
We don't want a mess now,
do we, on Christmas?

88
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,031
-Will that be all?
-That will not be all.

89
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,039
Merry Christmas.

90
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,211
Miss Crock, l wasn't expecting this.

91
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:20,174
l thought of something that l knew
you'd be thrilled to death with!

92
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:23,219
Miss Crock, God bless you.

93
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,180
-Open it!
-You are a good woman.

94
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,892
-What's this?
-Your favorite.

95
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,395
Mincemeat pie.

96
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:35,523
Where the hell is my suit?

97
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,444
Goodness gracious! Sakes alive!
l thought you'd like it.

98
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,571
-Like it?
-Yes.

99
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,450
And l put a pair of cuff links in there
as well.

100
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:48,077
You went all out, didn't you?

101
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,622
A pair of crackerjack cuff links
and one shitty pie!

102
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,796
What are you doing?

103
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,716
l thought we were going
to Leroy's Christmas kegger?

104
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,427
Miss Crock said
l gotta spend a night in the box.

105
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,180
Damn! lt's more like in Filipino prison.

106
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:10,808
-''Get in that sweatbox!''
-Leave me alone!

107
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,227
Fine.

108
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:17,607
Feliz Navidad.

109
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:23,988
Just in case you get hungry.

110
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,251
Beat it. This is my dinner.

111
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,965
You rat, l'll squash you.

112
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:46,135
Come here.

113
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:58,314
l can't believe l've tolerated him
for as long as l have.

114
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:01,401
He's just a user.
Willard's exploited your generosity.

115
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,695
That's exactly right.

116
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:07,198
l mean his father, Teddy, was a nice man.

117
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,742
-But enough is enough.
-Really.

118
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,869
Well, tomorrow, we'll...

119
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,163
...fire him.

120
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:16,791
Throw his stuff in the furnace.

121
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:26,050
-Santa Claus must be stopped.
-There will be no Christmas this year.

122
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,468
You got that right.

123
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,306
You're not gonna believe this.

124
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,349
The old grinch is gonna fire me.

125
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,893
lt's ridiculous.
Why would someone fire their slave?

126
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:39,397
Because she's mean.
She picked Christmas Day to do it.

127
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,816
Damn! You need revenge.

128
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:47,322
-Revenge! We need revenge!
-Revenge! We need revenge!

129
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:53,369
Let's kidnap Santa Claus. We'll break
into his toy shop and seize him!

130
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,872
Maybe those moon men are...

131
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,959
-...onto something.
-You mean we should kidnap Santa?

132
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:03,588
Wait a minute.
Why don't we just kidnap Miss Crock?

133
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:06,049
-No, it's crazy.
-No, that's brilliant!

134
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,551
We'll grab Granny
and hold her ass for ransom.

135
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,387
And if they don't pay,
we start hacking off her fingers.

136
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,723
First her thumb, then her pointer...

137
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:16,017
...then her little nasty finger.

138
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,727
What are you talking about?

139
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,397
We're not criminals.
You fry chicken, l drive a car.

140
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,984
When that money comes rolling in,
l'll go crazy, man!

141
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:27,695
-l'll laminate my menus.
-Shut up, okay?

142
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,157
We know nothing
about kidnapping an old lady.

143
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,370
But what about her dog?

144
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,246
-You mean Biscuit?
-No, Muffin.

145
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:41,709
Yeah, she loves him
more than anything in the world.

146
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:44,879
l bet she'd pay plenty
for that old bag of fleas.

147
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,674
Yeah, l bet she'd pay $1 million.

148
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,202
Remember, we have to be quiet
inside the house.

149
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,037
Miss Crock is a light sleeper.

150
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,331
You ain't gotta worry about me.

151
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:28,006
This place is nice.

152
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,178
What the hell are you doing?

153
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,724
-l'm checking for electric eyes.
-There's no electric eyes.

154
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,351
-How do you know? They're invisible.
-Trust me.

155
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:42,603
l've lived here my entire life.

156
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,529
So, this is where the old bitch sleeps?

157
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:01,581
Okay, give me the weenie.

158
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:16,054
Okay, Muffin.
l gotta special treat for you.

159
00:13:18,806 --> 00:13:19,807
Cripes!

160
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,440
What kind of aim was that?

161
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:28,941
Muffin!

162
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,694
Bite my weenie.

163
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:46,084
The hell with this. Plan B.

164
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,717
Will you shut that dog up?

165
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,390
You bastard!

166
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:26,457
Would you keep it down?

167
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,086
''Keep it down?''
This thing is eating my hand!

168
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:39,053
Jesus, this is a nightmare!

169
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:40,930
Put him in the box!

170
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,358
Who's smarter? Now who's smarter?

171
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,113
What should it say?

172
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,781
''We've got him.

173
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:02,368
''Pay us $1 million, or he's a dead dog!''

174
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:05,705
-How does that sound?
-Fine.

175
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:07,999
Let's get the hell out of here.

176
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:23,473
$1 million!

177
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,642
This is the happiest day of my life.

178
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,978
-With that money, we can do anything.
-l know what l'm gonna do.

179
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,606
l'm gonna buy me a four-star chicken hole.

180
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:35,193
l'll get a better neighborhood
and a listing in the Zagat Guide.

181
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:39,238
l'm going someplace warm where you
don't need layered clothing. Start over.

182
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:41,991
l got some good years left in me.
l can better myself.

183
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:45,370
l'm gonna register at one of them
four-year universities.

184
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:01,761
My friend...

185
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,097
...here's to second chances.

186
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,830
Did you have a lovely sleep, Muffin? Yes.

187
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:14,334
Now, we'll have a lovely breakfast,
you and....

188
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:23,593
Oh, my God!

189
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:27,055
Look at me.

190
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,431
Muffin!

191
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:31,643
Look what they've done to your mother.

192
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,770
l don't know....

193
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:42,820
''We've got him. Pay us $1 million
or he's a dead dog.''

194
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,032
Who's a dead dog?

195
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,034
Willard?

196
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,789
Man, we've got so many choices.

197
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,708
-l'm just trying to get out of Pittsburgh.
-You said it.

198
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,461
Check out this. Bora Bora.

199
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,714
l was thinking more like Caribbean myself.

200
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,426
Whichever one has a school
with a strong liberal arts program.

201
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,554
Lord! l'm dead!

202
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:12,850
-We're going to jail.
-What do you mean ''we''?

203
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:15,311
That's my picture on the front page.

204
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:25,530
Who would have thought kidnapping a dog
would make the front page?

205
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:29,117
Wait a minute. They think it was me.
They think l was kidnapped.

206
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,829
-They don't even mention Muffin.
-Why would somebody kidnap you?

207
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,039
l don't know, but they think someone did.

208
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:38,584
''There were signs of a scuffle,
the chauffeur's blood was on a wall...

209
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:41,379
''...and a note demanded $1 million...

210
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,173
''...or he's a dead dog.''

211
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,440
Sweet Jesus!

212
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,318
We kidnapped a turd.

213
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:06,029
According to sources,
the missing chauffeur had been...

214
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,948
...a loyal employee for over 15 years.

215
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:11,868
Virginia Crock,
known for her mouthwatering treats...

216
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,330
...awoke this morning
to news that was not so sweet.

217
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:30,011
Do you have any enemies?

218
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:34,557
Not that l know of.
l'm just an elderly lady who makes pies.

219
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:38,853
Well, does Mr. Fillmore have any enemies?

220
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:42,273
-Who?
-That's Willard's last name.

221
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,028
Not that l know of.

222
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:50,823
Did he have anybody
that he used to bring around the house?

223
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:53,242
Not that l know of.

224
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,205
Does he have any living relatives?

225
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:58,998
Not that l know of.

226
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:03,711
Ma'am...

227
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:07,173
...excuse me, but...

228
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,593
...this man worked for you
for over a decade...

229
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:15,264
...and you don't know
if he has any friends or any relatives?

230
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,101
Detective, Miss Crock has told you
everything she knows.

231
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,561
What do you mean?
She hasn't told me anything.

232
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:22,897
Sir, if it makes you happy...

233
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:26,651
...you go right ahead
and find Willard Fillmore.

234
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,904
As for me...

235
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:32,740
...it's time for my nap.

236
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,998
Sources say that Fillmore
moved to Pittsburgh at the age ofsix.

237
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:42,375
Here's the thing. I hardly knew Willard.

238
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:47,630
Police say ifyou have any information,
call the Piehunt Hotline at 1-800--

239
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,050
-How did this get so big?
-Rusty, we gotta turn ourselves in.

240
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:52,927
How? They think you're the victim.

241
00:20:53,011 --> 00:20:56,347
Shit! You have to be really dumb
to accidentally kidnap yourself.

242
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:59,851
Wait a minute.
This is all gonna get pinned on me!

243
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:03,104
You gotta get un-kidnapped!
You gotta escape!

244
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:07,191
The kidnappers go out to dinner,
you chew through the ropes, you get away.

245
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:10,653
Yeah, that's good.
That's good, but it should be real.

246
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:14,907
There was a struggle
and l got all bruised and beat up!

247
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:20,538
This is an airtight alibi.

248
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,874
Here. Let me help you.

249
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:23,916
Good.

250
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,336
-You like that, right?
-Yeah, wait a minute.

251
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:27,629
What?

252
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:29,714
l got an idea.

253
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:35,053
What are we worried about?
Why don't l just stay kidnapped?

254
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,846
Why?

255
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,057
lt makes perfect sense.

256
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,186
lnstead of them paying $1 million
for Muffin, they pay it for me.

257
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:46,022
Why would somebody pay
$1 million for you?

258
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,441
'Cause l'm a man. Muffin's a dog.

259
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:52,278
-Yeah, but he got a pedigree.
-Gimme a break, l'm better than he is!

260
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:57,700
Come on! l'm better than a dog!

261
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,912
l'm five times better.

262
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,126
-''$5 million.''
-lt's repugnant.

263
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:10,296
lt's like a rising stock.

264
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:13,424
Why did he jump from one to five?

265
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:26,562
All right, man. Let's see some real
emotion here. You're kidnapped.

266
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:29,983
Let's see some tears.
l want to feel something real.

267
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:33,736
-And action!
-Help! Save me!

268
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,573
Miss Crock, l'm begging you, please!

269
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:43,579
l got into MSNBC.
How do you plug that camera in?

270
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,582
l think like this.

271
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,881
In a startling development
in the Pittsburgh kidnapping...

272
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,968
...this shocking videotape
was e-mailed to MSNBC.

273
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:00,680
Help, Miss Crock, save me!
I'm begging you!

274
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:03,558
They got me wearing chains!

275
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:05,893
I'm living in a cage.

276
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,522
They're gonna kill me ifyou don'tpay.

277
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,817
Open your wallet, you tight-ass!

278
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,321
Jesus, somebody has to do something!

279
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,489
Dinnertime, dog.

280
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:24,996
They got me eating kibble.

281
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,335
I don't know how much longer I can last.

282
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:32,545
Oh, God, Chip...

283
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,256
...he's wearing a collar.

284
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:39,010
Collars don't hurt.
They're just trying to intimidate us.

285
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,887
Whatis that?

286
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,098
Is that urine? Itis!

287
00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:46,643
Itis! It's human urine!

288
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:51,439
Chip, we're late.

289
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,942
-Miss Crock!
-What's your reaction to the kibble video?

290
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:57,445
Have you changed your mind
about paying the ransom?

291
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:00,114
She'll not deal with criminals.
lt's a police matter.

292
00:24:00,198 --> 00:24:03,409
Your chauffeur was chained like a dog.
Where's your compassion?

293
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:05,536
l'll show you compassion.

294
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:09,248
Get your asses off my property!

295
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:11,376
I'm afraid you didn't hear me.

296
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:14,879
I'm afraid you didn't hear me!

297
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:21,636
Today, dessert baron Virginia Crock,
reiterated she will notpay the ransom.

298
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,056
We went to the man in the street
to find out what he thinks.

299
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:27,642
She's rich. She can afford it.

300
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:30,937
If I worked for that...chowder...slut...

301
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:35,650
...I'd tell her to...get down,
get busy on my...man.

302
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,445
More concerned citizens
have started a formal protest.

303
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:41,739
No more pies if Willard dies!

304
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,368
ls that Hillary?

305
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:47,870
She's looking good.

306
00:24:57,714 --> 00:24:59,757
Rich people are no good.

307
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:01,968
I'm never gonna eat herpie again.

308
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,225
This media blitz is killing us.

309
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:11,436
Our sales have dropped 50 percent.

310
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:21,821
Miss Crock, go to hell! Miss Crock--

311
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,206
Miss Crock, many bad things are happened.

312
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:35,084
We thought we were buying
your wholesome American image.

313
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:39,297
But it's terrible shock
that you don't rescue your loyal houseman.

314
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,592
Sweet old lady on pie box
is now super-villain.

315
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:45,261
l'm sorry, honey. They're playing hardball.

316
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:47,847
lf you don't pay up, they're gonna walk.

317
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:55,229
Fuck!

318
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:58,524
Of course I'm gonna pay the ransom.

319
00:25:58,608 --> 00:26:03,905
Ijust didn't want to encourage
those underworld criminals.

320
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,825
But now I want Willard
home again with me.

321
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:11,412
The old hag is coughing up!

322
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:15,208
Thank you, Miss Crock.
And thank you, Hillary, for kicking her ass!

323
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,459
l'm free!

324
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,586
We are millionaires!

325
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,756
Anybody here?

326
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:23,758
Hello?

327
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:28,221
What can l do for you?

328
00:26:28,513 --> 00:26:29,973
Are you Rusty P. Hayes?

329
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:33,434
Yes, l am. Can l interest you
in my shrimp boat special?

330
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:37,480
No. l'm here investigating
the kidnapping of Willard Fillmore.

331
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:39,190
Who?

332
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:43,361
-You must have read about him.
-l don't read newspapers.

333
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,947
We thought you might know him.

334
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,908
We were going through
Mr. Fillmore's belongings...

335
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:53,663
...and we found this
''Chicken Dinner Special'' punch card.

336
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:55,164
Really?

337
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,750
Yeah, this guy.

338
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:01,462
-l was wondering what happened to him.
-He was kidnapped.

339
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:03,965
When he came in here, did he...

340
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:07,593
...ever do anything unusual
that would draw attention to him?

341
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:13,224
One time l seen him eat
50 chicken gizzards all by himself.

342
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:17,186
Look, if you come across anything
that might help us...

343
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:19,939
-...give me a call.
-Sure.

344
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:22,650
l hate loose ends...

345
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,902
...and l want this case to end.

346
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:45,214
l was so scared,
l thought l was gonna pee in my pants.

347
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,884
He knows something.
He had a funny look on his face.

348
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,845
-Why'd you tell him so much?
-l didn't tell him nothing.

349
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:53,556
l told him about the time
you ate 50 chicken gizzards.

350
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,060
That wasn't me!
That was some Chinese guy.

351
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:59,562
Fong did do that, didn't he?

352
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:03,691
l'm telling you, we got problems.
That evil Kojak hates loose ends.

353
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:07,737
And when they pay and l don't show up,
that's a loose end. He'll go nuts!

354
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:12,575
-You'll be some place nice, like Jamaica.
-Yeah, well, he'll track me there.

355
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,371
Wait a minute. What if we fooled them
and made them think l was dead?

356
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:19,082
Like maybe if we borrowed a corpse.

357
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,501
Don't we know somebody
who knows somebody...

358
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:23,086
...who works at the morgue?

359
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,672
Hillary used to live across the street...

360
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:29,467
...from a dude who was in the army
with this guy who worked at the morgue.

361
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,427
l forgot it was Hillary.

362
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:36,808
Yeah, you can't hit her up, man.
She just walked a picket line for you.

363
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,787
Oh, my God!

364
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,874
l never thought l'd see you again,
and here you are.

365
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:05,044
-l brought you flowers.
-Oh, my God!

366
00:29:05,128 --> 00:29:06,838
Wow! You're such a class act.

367
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:09,716
You get ransomed,
then you buy me flowers.

368
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:14,095
Well, l didn't get ransomed, per se.

369
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,141
-Did you escape?
-No, l didn't escape literally.

370
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:26,566
Shit.

371
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:33,114
Where'd they go?

372
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:42,957
-All right, how did you do it?
-lt was really no problem.

373
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:47,086
l told her the truth, we had a little sex,
she told me the guy's name: Grover.

374
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,548
Damn! Did all that in ten minutes.

375
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,304
Spooky!

376
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:33,967
Grover?

377
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:44,519
What are you doing? Get away from that.

378
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:46,646
l'm sorry.

379
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:48,815
lt's just a rock.

380
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,650
lt's not just a rock.

381
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:55,446
lt's a pet rock.

382
00:30:56,447 --> 00:31:00,076
A pet rock.
l haven't seen one of these in years.

383
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,496
Yeah. l just dug it out of his colon.

384
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:10,670
Yeah, it's still warm.

385
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,006
l got a whole collection.

386
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,884
lt's really amazing...

387
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:20,805
...what you dig out of the inside
of dead people when you cut them open.

388
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:24,058
People swallow everything.
Here's some dice.

389
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,061
The guy must have been to Vegas.

390
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:32,817
Got all kinds of stuff here.
This beautiful harmonica.

391
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:38,740
-Don't put that in your mouth.
-This is interesting here.

392
00:31:39,324 --> 00:31:40,366
Yes.

393
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,579
You gotta go in that way.
lt couldn't have gone in this way.

394
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:47,332
He would have noticed. A broom?

395
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:54,964
''Where'd it go?''

396
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:59,802
''Oh, forget about it.''
He's dead, and then you find it.

397
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:02,180
You know, it's all kinds of stuff like that.

398
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:04,057
This is good. Yeah.

399
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:08,394
lt's a clicker.
''Hey, honey, where's the clicker?''

400
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:10,855
''l don't know.''

401
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:13,232
''lnside me.''

402
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,943
Here. Look at this.

403
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:18,029
A perfectly good comb.

404
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:21,991
Grover, how would you like
to make $100,000?

405
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:25,954
Well, that's a lot of cheese.

406
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:27,747
What l gotta do?

407
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:31,834
l want people to think that l'm dead.

408
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:35,922
Dead?

409
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:40,969
Yeah, you just take one of the dead bodies
and dress it up like my man Willard here.

410
00:32:41,052 --> 00:32:43,388
And when they find it, they think it's him.

411
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,141
You think it's that easy?
l can just take up any old body...

412
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:48,685
...and give it to you?

413
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:50,436
l got filing slips!

414
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,147
My bodies are catalogued!
This is a tight ship!

415
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:56,651
Why don't you take some old bum
that nobody would notice?

416
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:57,986
A ''bum''?

417
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:01,155
Come on! lf you do it,
there's $100,000 for you.

418
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,241
Will it show up on my W2?

419
00:33:03,324 --> 00:33:05,159
No, tax-free.

420
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:09,414
Good. Because why should my money
go to pave roads and build schools?

421
00:33:09,497 --> 00:33:12,709
Yeah, good point. Listen. This is the plan.

422
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:14,669
Dump the body tomorrow night.

423
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,422
And make sure you get someone
that looks like me, okay?

424
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:19,132
No problem. Piece of cake.

425
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:22,302
Here's some clothes of mine
that you can put on him, all right?

426
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:25,388
And l got my driver's license.

427
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:28,141
-You put that in his pocket.
-Yes.

428
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:30,435
-And here's some jewelry.
-Jewelry?

429
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:33,354
Those are nice.

430
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:38,192
Wait a minute.

431
00:33:38,776 --> 00:33:40,528
lsn't this suit kind of ratty?

432
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:44,198
Ain't it gonna be degrading for a dead man
to have to wear this trash?

433
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:46,367
-Just do it.
-All right.

434
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,287
l'll do it.

435
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:55,001
Miss Crock, l just want to thank you
for agreeing to pay the ransom.

436
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:58,921
'Cause most folks....

437
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,759
Most folks just don't appreciate
the work we cops do.

438
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:06,929
-Virginia.
-What?

439
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:12,644
Willard, bring in our guests
some coffee here!

440
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,234
-What's that?
-l don't know.

441
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,784
The cover page is from Pic 'n' Shop.

442
00:34:31,913 --> 00:34:33,456
lt's from the kidnappers.

443
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:37,168
''Miss Crock, bring the cash
to Three Rivers Stadium at 10:00 PM.

444
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:40,088
''No cops or the chauffeur dies.''

445
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:41,506
No cops!

446
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:44,676
What if those bums run off
with my money?

447
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,720
Don't worry, ma'am.
That ballpark is so gigantic...

448
00:34:47,804 --> 00:34:50,682
...we're gonna be able to hide
a million cops in there.

449
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:55,019
l thought these guys were smart,
but they're in way over their heads.

450
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:07,365
You think the cops are gonna show up
at the stadium?

451
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,369
You kidding me, man? lt's gonna be
like rush hour at Dunkin' Donuts.

452
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,037
Yeah.

453
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:16,499
l'll be waiting for you
in the Runway Lounge.

454
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,711
-Don't forget. The flight's at midnight.
-Then, tomorrow...

455
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:22,547
-...we'll be lying on the beach.
-Sipping margaritas.

456
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,090
Smoking a fatty.

457
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:32,307
This is the most distressful day of my life.

458
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:35,184
Do we have to pay them all the money?

459
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:39,480
l mean, couldn't we, l don't know,
sort of shortchange them a little?

460
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,441
Virginia, bite the bullet.

461
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:44,819
l'm sure your taxman
will figure a way to write it off.

462
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:48,990
That's a lot of green.

463
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:56,789
Jesus Christ, l don't know what the hell
the wheel is doing on this side of the car.

464
00:35:56,956 --> 00:36:01,794
God almighty, l don't know how
poor Willard ever put up with this shit.

465
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:10,470
-Hello?
-This is the kidnapper.

466
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:14,015
-How'd you get my number?
-Shut up! There's been a change in plan.

467
00:36:14,098 --> 00:36:17,518
-Don't go to no stadium.
-l gotta go to the stadium.

468
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:21,939
You're not gonna do nothing
until l tell you to, you smelly old bitch.

469
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,691
Nowlisten...

470
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:25,443
...you meet me at Midtown Park.

471
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:28,404
That place isn't safe after dark!

472
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:32,283
Cork it! I'll see you there in ten minutes.

473
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:41,084
-Quick, get me the police!
-l'm still here!

474
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:47,548
Try any more games like that,
l'll put a bullet through Willard's head.

475
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:20,456
Gimme the money!

476
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,626
You're the kidnapper.

477
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,587
You no-good hooligan!

478
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:29,632
You decimate my house.

479
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:32,468
You violate my public goodwill!

480
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:36,973
And why? Why me?
What did l ever do to you?

481
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:39,392
Gimme the money!

482
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:41,602
You oughta be ashamed of yourself!

483
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:45,189
Does your mother know
the kind of work that you do?

484
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:47,650
Don't you ever stop talking?

485
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:49,777
Gimme the money!

486
00:37:54,574 --> 00:37:59,662
Now, l expect you to return Willard
in exactly the same condition he was in!

487
00:37:59,746 --> 00:38:03,958
He was a strong worker!
And he had good teeth!

488
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:08,129
l got the money! l got the money!

489
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:12,717
l gotta buy Hillary a nice dinner.
l'm gonna buy my mom a new headstone.

490
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,387
One with her name on it and everything!
l got the money!

491
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:18,431
Mister!

492
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,727
-What's in the suitcase?
-Get away from me.

493
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,520
Hey, mister, what's in the suitcase?

494
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:27,482
-Hand it over!
-Get away from me, you little shit!

495
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:30,151
-What's in the suitcase?
-Show us some respect.

496
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:33,029
-What's in the suitcase?
-Hand it over!

497
00:38:33,112 --> 00:38:36,032
-l don't like your attitude.
-Take a hike.

498
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,078
Jesus Christ!

499
00:38:40,495 --> 00:38:41,663
Harder!

500
00:38:42,914 --> 00:38:43,998
Zap him!

501
00:38:56,636 --> 00:39:00,098
You can't let him down now.
You can't let him down.

502
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:06,020
Yeah, let's see.

503
00:39:50,732 --> 00:39:52,317
Not bad.

504
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:08,166
Don't pay any attention to me.

505
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:10,877
l'm just gonna take some work home.

506
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,546
l'm very conscientious.

507
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:17,800
Oh, boy.

508
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:21,471
l'll go get it.

509
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:31,481
Wake up!

510
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,151
Where am l? What is this?
What's going on here?

511
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:39,155
The police found you beat up in the park.

512
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:44,994
But, of course, those incompetents let
the kidnappers get away, with my money.

513
00:40:45,078 --> 00:40:47,038
So, l was in the park...

514
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:50,166
...and they got away with the $5 million....

515
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:51,668
You owe me.

516
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:55,046
And you're going to work off that ransom...

517
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:59,717
...until the day Jesus calls you home.

518
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:07,642
Just a chunk light in spring water,
not in olive oil, and a diet Coke.

519
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:12,897
There you are, as l live and breathe.
Pittsburgh's finest.

520
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:14,941
l'm truly sorry, ma'am.

521
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:18,903
But if it's any consolation,
we had every inch of that stadium covered.

522
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:19,988
We had snipers.

523
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:22,949
Who cares?

524
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:26,786
Would you do me a favor?

525
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:32,333
Find my cash.

526
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,712
l gotta get outta here.

527
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,354
Mr. Fillmore, l....

528
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,485
-Could l have a few words with you?
-Sure, of course.

529
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:03,072
-How can l help you?
-l wonder, Mr. Fillmore....

530
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:09,037
l wonder if you would...

531
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:12,749
-...give me a description of the kidnappers?
-The kidnappers.

532
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:16,127
Well, l never actually saw the kidnappers...

533
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,922
...that well because l was kept blindfolded.

534
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:21,883
Blindfolded?

535
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:25,011
But you were not blindfolded on the video.

536
00:42:25,178 --> 00:42:27,096
No, l wasn't.

537
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:29,807
No, l wasn't blindfolded on the video.

538
00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:33,353
But l didn't see the kidnappers
then either, because...

539
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:37,899
...they hired a TV crew to shoot the video.

540
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:42,612
Yeah, we did it in a studio with a crew.

541
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:51,245
You got any Nuprin?

542
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:53,247
No.

543
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:55,708
Why? What happened in there?

544
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:58,628
The bozo's covering for the kidnappers.

545
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:01,464
l really gotta get out of here.

546
00:43:05,677 --> 00:43:08,680
-Stop!
-Where do you think you're going?

547
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,598
Rusty! Hey, Rust.

548
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,060
-Where you been?
-The drop off did not go as planned.

549
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,106
l concur 'cause the plan never mentioned
my best friend two-timing me.

550
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:20,817
-l didn't two-time you!
-Come on, man!

551
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,696
''l'll do the drop all by myself,
that way Rusty won't get in trouble.''

552
00:43:24,862 --> 00:43:28,199
Where's the bag of money?
Why aren't you at the airport?

553
00:43:28,533 --> 00:43:32,453
-What are you doing in a hospital?
-A street gang took the money.

554
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:36,374
-Bullshit! You're ripping me off!
-No! l swear to God.

555
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:39,168
lt was these big muscle men in the park.

556
00:43:39,294 --> 00:43:42,213
They beat me up and took the $5 million.

557
00:43:42,297 --> 00:43:44,674
They had guns and tattoos...

558
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:49,679
...and they had those two sticks on a chain
that you swing and you hurt people with.

559
00:43:49,762 --> 00:43:54,183
-Are you saying you were mugged?
-Mugged? lt was more like a rape.

560
00:43:56,853 --> 00:43:59,272
Well, not a real rape.

561
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:03,359
Look, Grand lnquisitor,
if you had ripped me off...

562
00:44:03,443 --> 00:44:07,530
...would you barricade yourself
in a hospital room with 20 cops outside?

563
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:09,782
You make an interesting point.

564
00:44:09,991 --> 00:44:13,161
lt's not imaginable
that things could be more botched.

565
00:44:13,244 --> 00:44:14,287
Yeah?

566
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:17,206
What about Grover?

567
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:20,960
Oh, no! That fruitcake's
gonna be dumping my fake body.

568
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:25,882
Hello, County Morgue, Rita speaking.
Can l help you?

569
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:28,593
I'd like to speak to a Grover Cleaver.

570
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:31,220
l'm sorry.
Mr. Cleaver no longer works here.

571
00:44:31,304 --> 00:44:33,473
Bitch, what are you talking about?

572
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:38,353
Mr. Cleaver quit yesterday.

573
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:41,272
He said he was joining the superrich.

574
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:48,363
Grover retired from the morgue.
Too wealthy to hold a job.

575
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:51,658
Man, we are no good at this.
We gotta stop this guy.

576
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:54,494
-How? We don't know where to find him.
-Call Hillary.

577
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:55,912
She doesn't know him.

578
00:44:55,995 --> 00:45:00,416
She knew his name from that fat dude
who used to live across the street.

579
00:45:02,126 --> 00:45:03,753
You're so defeatist!

580
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,255
Fine. l'll track him down myself.

581
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:09,175
lf you did it,
you'd probably muck it up anyway.

582
00:45:10,218 --> 00:45:12,470
The guy can't do anything right.

583
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:18,393
Detective!

584
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,313
Mr. Hayes. What are you doing here?

585
00:45:25,775 --> 00:45:27,944
l'm visiting my Aunt Mabel.

586
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:32,991
She's real sick.
She got polio and emphysema...

587
00:45:33,074 --> 00:45:36,619
...all that shit together.
lt's gonna kill her. l swear.

588
00:45:37,453 --> 00:45:40,832
She's staying in this room right here.
l'm gonna go say hi.

589
00:45:46,754 --> 00:45:49,549
Aunt Mabel, come gimme some sugar, girl.

590
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:53,761
l told you don't listen to them doctors!

591
00:45:56,681 --> 00:45:59,934
Okay, you're convulsing. You gotta relax.

592
00:46:00,852 --> 00:46:02,353
All right, Aunt Mabel!

593
00:46:02,437 --> 00:46:05,440
l'm gonna let you get some rest!
Get some rest, Aunt Mabel!

594
00:46:05,523 --> 00:46:08,276
All right, give Uncle Gordon my love!

595
00:46:16,576 --> 00:46:20,622
That medicine got Aunt Mabel
real irritable. She's crazy.

596
00:46:20,913 --> 00:46:23,207
She's normally a real sweetheart.

597
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:24,751
Detective!

598
00:46:25,543 --> 00:46:28,546
Detective, you're not gonna believe
what's happened.

599
00:46:31,758 --> 00:46:34,052
We've just discovered a dead body.

600
00:46:34,552 --> 00:46:35,970
Shit.

601
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:44,687
They found the body!
They found the body!

602
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:46,272
Oh, my Lord.

603
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:50,276
That dumb-ass Grover. He's the only one
of us who follows directions.

604
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,280
We're going to jail. We're going to jail.
We're gonna be somebody's bitch.

605
00:46:54,656 --> 00:46:57,742
Maybe if we confess, they'll go easy on us.

606
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:01,287
Yeah, maybe we'll just get
community service.

607
00:47:01,454 --> 00:47:04,958
Or maybe they'll take us
to one of those country club prisons.

608
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,793
We'll talk stocks with bankers.

609
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:10,254
-We could really make some connections.
-You're insane.

610
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:12,882
We're gonna be somebody's bitch.

611
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:19,722
Willard.

612
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,976
l have some shocking news.

613
00:47:23,226 --> 00:47:25,061
They found your kidnapper.

614
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:31,859
-Are you sure it was the kidnapper?
-Of course l'm sure!

615
00:47:31,943 --> 00:47:36,239
They found his dead body on the front
steps of the Quaker Wax Museum.

616
00:47:36,614 --> 00:47:42,120
He was wearing all your clothes
and those divine cuff links l gave you.

617
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,249
Any idea why the kidnapper
would be wearing your clothes?

618
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:48,876
No.

619
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,798
Any idea why the kidnapper
would be dead?

620
00:47:54,173 --> 00:47:57,802
Well, that kidnapping den
was a real hothouse of emotion, you know.

621
00:47:57,885 --> 00:47:59,595
Anything could have happened.

622
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:04,559
Well, let's just hope that body
isn't so ripped up that you can't identify it.

623
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,568
That's the guy. No question.
That's the kidnapper.

624
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:15,111
That's the guy?

625
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:20,700
That's the guy who beat you up
and held you prisoner?

626
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:26,247
Yeah, well, he was a lot more ferocious
back when he was alive.

627
00:48:26,414 --> 00:48:29,167
Ferocious? He's an old midget.

628
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:33,630
Yeah, but he had a real low voice.
You know, very intimidating.

629
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:37,383
''Put your hands behind your head!
Get in the corner.''

630
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:41,971
That's him. That's him!
l'd recognize that voice anywhere.

631
00:48:47,226 --> 00:48:48,436
Okay.

632
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:54,442
Well, in some weird, screwy way
that l will never understand...

633
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:56,277
...that is the kidnapper.

634
00:48:56,736 --> 00:49:00,698
l'm telling you, this whole thing stinks.
Fillmore and Hayes are connected.

635
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:03,785
-Yeah, that midget was no tough guy.
-No shit, Sherlock.

636
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:06,788
They are definitely hiding
something or someone.

637
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:13,044
Our 1-800 line produced an eyewitness.
Meet Edgar Kettle. He saw the drop.

638
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:14,963
Yeah.

639
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:18,424
l saw the whole thing. The whole thing.

640
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:20,760
Last night,
l was in my check-cashing store.

641
00:49:20,843 --> 00:49:25,473
l look out and l see a man
toss a body onto the steps.

642
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:29,644
-What kind of man?
-He was ugly.

643
00:49:29,978 --> 00:49:31,396
Real ugly.

644
00:49:31,479 --> 00:49:36,025
Get me the sketch artist in here right now.
This case is about to break.

645
00:49:47,537 --> 00:49:49,539
That looks just like me.

646
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,418
''Wanted for Crock kidnapping.''

647
00:50:05,096 --> 00:50:07,181
Make this go away.

648
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:40,840
l'm screwed!

649
00:50:42,592 --> 00:50:46,346
Willard, take away my salad plate!

650
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:49,182
I'm ready for the second course!

651
00:50:49,474 --> 00:50:50,516
Yeah.

652
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:53,811
''Stick with Miss Crock. You'll get ahead.''

653
00:51:04,656 --> 00:51:07,533
Apologize to the man!
Apologize for what you did!

654
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:10,161
l'm sorry for misbehaving in the park.

655
00:51:10,244 --> 00:51:12,830
You better be!
This is the man you wronged, Tito.

656
00:51:12,914 --> 00:51:16,834
-Now, give back what you took.
-Here it is, mister. l didn't even open it.

657
00:51:16,918 --> 00:51:19,671
That's 'cause you couldn't open it, liar!
lt was locked!

658
00:51:19,754 --> 00:51:23,758
As soon as l saw the address on the tag
we drove it straight over here.

659
00:51:25,134 --> 00:51:26,844
-Thanks.
-Come on!

660
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:29,806
Your hide has an appointment
with my hand!

661
00:51:41,693 --> 00:51:44,404
Yeah! Let's party!

662
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:49,367
''Willard, clear my salad plate!''
Yeah, well, lick me, you old bag!

663
00:51:49,492 --> 00:51:51,661
Your busboy's going to Bermuda!

664
00:51:51,995 --> 00:51:54,539
We're going to Bali, so l can date her.

665
00:51:54,872 --> 00:51:57,250
-Yeah!
-Get some Bali booty.

666
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:04,215
Hurry up! Hurry up! Move out!

667
00:52:06,801 --> 00:52:08,511
Come on! Come on!

668
00:52:10,805 --> 00:52:13,641
You can't park there!
That's a tow-away zone!

669
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:16,936
We ain't never coming back.
Go park it up your ass.

670
00:52:31,326 --> 00:52:35,330
Excuse me. We'd like two tickets to Bali.

671
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:36,914
First class.

672
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,961
-And how will you be paying for that?
-That's a good question.

673
00:52:42,045 --> 00:52:45,214
-That hadn't really occurred to us.
-How about this?

674
00:52:45,298 --> 00:52:46,966
-Cash!
-Cash!

675
00:52:53,973 --> 00:52:56,893
-Don't worry, we got money.
-Back off there, lady.

676
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:04,984
There's no money!
Miss Crock double-crossed us!

677
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:06,527
The old crow never paid!

678
00:53:06,778 --> 00:53:10,865
She didn't care if l lived or died!
She just ransomed me with cabbage!

679
00:53:10,949 --> 00:53:14,953
The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading ofpassengers.

680
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:21,501
l told you not to park there.

681
00:53:25,755 --> 00:53:29,133
She double-crossed us.
We'll triple-cross her.

682
00:53:29,342 --> 00:53:33,680
But this time, we'll kidnap Miss Crock
like l said we do in the first place.

683
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,015
No, man, it's over.

684
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:52,532
Listen, sorry l had to leave so,
you know, quickly the other day.

685
00:53:52,907 --> 00:53:54,951
That's all right, speedy.

686
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:57,620
l know you had a crime wave to get to.

687
00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:00,164
So what do you need tonight? Dynamite?

688
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:03,126
Nitro? A getaway driver, maybe?

689
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:06,921
No. None of that.
Our gang's gone straight.

690
00:54:07,714 --> 00:54:10,925
All l need now is a new life.

691
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,931
Willard!

692
00:54:17,348 --> 00:54:18,933
Answer the door.

693
00:54:23,146 --> 00:54:25,148
Honest to God, he kills me.

694
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:27,692
His father never would have
goofed off like this.

695
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:30,612
He's never around when.... l'm coming!

696
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:37,076
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

697
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,287
This is who the hell l am!

698
00:54:40,163 --> 00:54:42,206
l'm wanted by every cop in Pittsburgh!

699
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,960
-l don't even know what l did wrong!
-Oh, my God.

700
00:54:46,127 --> 00:54:49,589
You're the son of a bitch
who's got my money!

701
00:54:49,672 --> 00:54:52,258
What money? l never got no $100,000.

702
00:54:52,383 --> 00:54:54,427
$100,000 my ass!

703
00:54:54,636 --> 00:54:58,056
-lt was five million big ones!
-What are you, batty?

704
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:01,017
-The deal was for $100,000.
-What deal?

705
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,145
-You ripped me off!
-Yeah?

706
00:55:08,399 --> 00:55:10,234
Good shot, huh?

707
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:12,862
Would you get the hell out of my house?

708
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,490
Where's Willard?

709
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,450
-Where's Willard?
-Where is he?

710
00:55:17,533 --> 00:55:20,328
-You want Willard? l'll get him.
-Don't do that to me!

711
00:55:20,411 --> 00:55:23,164
-You think l'm stupid?
-l'll get him!

712
00:55:23,247 --> 00:55:26,167
-You sons of bitches ain't ripping me off!
-Holy shit!

713
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,754
-Go on!
-Oh, my God! Help me!

714
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:35,176
-Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
-Come here, sweetie pie!

715
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:37,887
-God!
-l got you!

716
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:41,182
l got you. Watch your head.

717
00:55:45,853 --> 00:55:47,105
Come on!

718
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,110
Muffin! Muffin, attack!

719
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:57,865
Nice doggy.

720
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:01,035
Please, attack!

721
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:04,372
Come on!

722
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,338
Miss Crock, l got news for you!
l'm quitting!

723
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,759
Miss Crock, where are you?

724
00:56:17,302 --> 00:56:20,555
-Hey, Miss Crock!
-l got some news for you, whore!

725
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:23,599
l'm packing up
and moving out of this dump!

726
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:27,186
That's right, you heard me!
Good-bye, pie hag!

727
00:56:31,274 --> 00:56:32,775
Where's she at?

728
00:56:44,454 --> 00:56:45,580
Oh, my God!

729
00:56:45,872 --> 00:56:47,832
Grover stole my idea.

730
00:56:47,915 --> 00:56:51,210
Virginia! Where are you? We're late.

731
00:56:51,794 --> 00:56:54,547
Virginia, the party starts at 9:00.
Are you ready?

732
00:56:57,592 --> 00:57:01,346
-What's going on here?
-We were just turning down the sheets.

733
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:03,181
Where's Miss Crock?

734
00:57:03,264 --> 00:57:06,309
Who are you?
What's that note in your hand?

735
00:57:12,482 --> 00:57:14,359
What'd you do that for?

736
00:57:15,026 --> 00:57:16,569
l was scared.

737
00:57:17,695 --> 00:57:20,657
-What do we do now?
-Run!

738
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:26,037
-This is so bad!
-Jesus forgive me!

739
00:57:34,379 --> 00:57:36,005
Help. Police.

740
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:38,508
That stupid Grover!

741
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:41,094
What kind of kidnapper
uses his own stationery?

742
00:57:41,177 --> 00:57:43,763
You know, they're gonna catch him,
and when they do...

743
00:57:43,846 --> 00:57:46,391
...he's gonna blab all about us!

744
00:57:52,146 --> 00:57:54,232
They're hunting us down!

745
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:00,780
Stop! This is the police!

746
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:03,866
-Well, no shit!
-Let's jump that fence!

747
00:58:05,118 --> 00:58:08,371
-l'm getting a charley horse!
-l gotta start working out!

748
00:58:15,211 --> 00:58:17,630
Freeze! You're under arrest!

749
00:58:20,174 --> 00:58:22,135
Details are sketchy,
butin a twiststranger than bizarre...

750
00:58:22,218 --> 00:58:25,054
...Miss Virginia Crock herself
has been kidnapped.

751
00:58:26,097 --> 00:58:27,056
Oh, my God!

752
00:58:28,433 --> 00:58:30,601
Snowball. Baby, let me in!

753
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:32,937
Open up!

754
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:37,650
-Have you heard the news?
-Yes, l know. lt's terrible.

755
00:58:40,945 --> 00:58:42,989
-What are we gonna do?
-l don't know.

756
00:58:43,072 --> 00:58:46,242
-But this is not our fault.
-You said it wouldn't hurt anyone!

757
00:58:46,326 --> 00:58:49,329
You said if we switched the money
nothing would happen.

758
00:58:49,412 --> 00:58:50,997
The kidnappers would be stuck!

759
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,167
All l meant was
that they couldn't complain to the police.

760
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,918
Now we've pissed them off!

761
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:58,880
You deserve that money.
She's been a figurehead for years.

762
00:58:59,255 --> 00:58:59,881
Oh, stop it!

763
00:58:59,964 --> 00:59:02,592
You're the only one
holding that bakery together.

764
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:04,761
l had to. She's out of her mind.

765
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:09,974
Exactly. So, why don't we
just let the kidnappers keep her?

766
00:59:12,769 --> 00:59:14,729
Get me out of here!

767
00:59:14,812 --> 00:59:18,399
The pain! I got a medical condition.

768
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:20,652
All right, Fillmore. Time to talk.

769
00:59:20,735 --> 00:59:22,904
My dick hurts!

770
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,287
l want the truth. What's your connection
to Rusty P. Hayes?

771
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:35,166
l've known Rusty my whole life.
Our mothers were in church choir together.

772
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:38,294
l don't even know this chauffeur guy,
all right?

773
00:59:38,378 --> 00:59:41,381
The first time l seen him
was in my restaurant, two weeks ago.

774
00:59:41,464 --> 00:59:44,092
Last night, like every week,
l called up Rusty...

775
00:59:44,175 --> 00:59:47,053
...and told him to come
and watch Monday Night Football.

776
00:59:47,136 --> 00:59:49,222
Last night was Thursday.

777
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:53,559
Yeah. l'm sorry. lt wasn't
Monday Night Football. lt was Oprah.

778
00:59:53,643 --> 00:59:56,729
Last night, l get this call
to make a delivery...

779
00:59:56,896 --> 00:59:58,898
...to this Wilbur guy.

780
00:59:59,065 --> 01:00:01,317
You mean, Willard.

781
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:03,778
Yeah, right. Willard.

782
01:00:03,903 --> 01:00:08,783
So anyway, l drive up to this mansion
in my chicken delivery truck.

783
01:00:08,908 --> 01:00:13,538
You know your truck was impounded
at the airport earlier that day?

784
01:00:13,621 --> 01:00:15,248
lt was?

785
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,043
Yeah, right. No, l was on foot.

786
01:00:19,294 --> 01:00:23,006
So anyway, the doorbell rings,
and it's the kidnappers!

787
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,301
So, they started chasing us.

788
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:28,511
And then Miss Crock,
l remember she showed up.

789
01:00:28,594 --> 01:00:32,765
She ran in, and she'd just been taking
a bath, so she was nude.

790
01:00:32,849 --> 01:00:35,059
Of course, naturally, this upset everybody.

791
01:00:35,143 --> 01:00:37,478
Gunshots started going off, man.

792
01:00:37,562 --> 01:00:40,106
The windows was exploding,
l heard screaming.

793
01:00:40,189 --> 01:00:42,775
So, l run to my truck as fast as l can.

794
01:00:43,067 --> 01:00:47,113
l mean, l run away because l was scared.

795
01:00:47,196 --> 01:00:52,327
Chip Oswald says you hit him
over the head with a desk lamp.

796
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,372
No, he's mistaken.

797
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:58,750
He's mistaken. That was not me.

798
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:02,629
So, Rusty's got this desk lamp
and he's beating the hell out of Chip.

799
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:05,673
And, he's pounding him and pounding him.

800
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,051
Then l say:

801
01:01:08,134 --> 01:01:12,138
''Rusty, that's not the kidnappers.
That's Chip!''

802
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:15,558
That's when the cops showed up
and they distracted everybody...

803
01:01:16,351 --> 01:01:18,061
...and the kidnappers got away.

804
01:01:19,187 --> 01:01:21,314
One final question.

805
01:01:22,231 --> 01:01:25,318
Let's forget all this other crap.

806
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:28,446
Where is Miss Crock?

807
01:01:29,113 --> 01:01:29,948
l don't know.

808
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:32,951
Who is Miss Crock?

809
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:37,747
Come on. Open your mouth.

810
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,999
Come on. You want some food, Blackie?

811
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,751
Eat some dinner.

812
01:01:42,293 --> 01:01:44,879
Eat it, Blackie. lt's good. Look.

813
01:01:45,672 --> 01:01:48,091
-Come on, Blackie.
-His name is Muffin.

814
01:01:48,257 --> 01:01:49,968
lt is not Blackie.

815
01:01:50,468 --> 01:01:51,844
Shut up!

816
01:01:52,095 --> 01:01:56,265
The dog's name is what l say it is
until somebody takes you off my hands.

817
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:59,477
The sooner the better, Poopy.
The sooner the better!

818
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,854
-Yeah, go on!
-''Yeah, go on!''

819
01:02:03,648 --> 01:02:05,024
Help!

820
01:02:06,609 --> 01:02:10,321
That's my favorite TV program.
We're gonna watch it, Blackie.

821
01:02:10,405 --> 01:02:13,616
This is it. Look at that. See that?

822
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:15,827
Hawaii Five-0.

823
01:02:16,786 --> 01:02:20,456
-What have we got, Danno?
-Klaus Marburg. West German passport.

824
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:21,874
-How bad?
-How bad?

825
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,627
-Pretty bad. Went right through him.
-Any witnesses?

826
01:02:24,711 --> 01:02:26,671
-Any witnesses?
-Yeah, lots of them.

827
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:28,881
-Only one shot?
-Only one shot?

828
01:02:28,965 --> 01:02:29,799
Just one.

829
01:02:31,426 --> 01:02:33,845
He was hitjust after
he stepped off the ramp.

830
01:02:33,928 --> 01:02:37,265
Steve, take a look. Finished.

831
01:02:38,558 --> 01:02:41,519
What is your obsession with that guy?

832
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,105
lt's Jack Lord!

833
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,150
l'm the vice president
of his national fan club.

834
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:49,360
Clam up, will you?

835
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:56,451
Hey! What are you, crazy?

836
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:00,747
The show's not over yet.

837
01:03:00,913 --> 01:03:02,624
Give me that.

838
01:03:06,586 --> 01:03:09,505
-Excuse me. May I have your attention?
-Oh, my God.

839
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:12,133
I'm pleased to announce
that Miss Crock's Bakery...

840
01:03:12,216 --> 01:03:14,719
...is now merging
with Copenhagen Snak Food.

841
01:03:14,927 --> 01:03:17,555
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Additionally...

842
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,225
...in accordance with Miss Crock's policy
regarding kidnapping...

843
01:03:21,309 --> 01:03:24,646
...we will notpay the ransom.

844
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:28,608
I know Miss Crock will be proud of us
standing behind herlike this.

845
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:32,236
Hey, wait a minute.
l'm gonna get screwed on this deal.

846
01:03:35,156 --> 01:03:37,283
That's two dozen anthuriums.

847
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:45,708
What?

848
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:49,170
What did l do? Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

849
01:03:49,253 --> 01:03:51,422
l swear l'm innocent!

850
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,675
No, please! Don't!

851
01:03:53,758 --> 01:03:57,345
-Who's the crybaby?
-We just busted the guy.

852
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:01,432
He was trying to pass the marked bills
from the Fillmore kidnapping.

853
01:04:01,516 --> 01:04:03,184
Well, what do you know?

854
01:04:03,267 --> 01:04:06,020
The brains behind the operation.

855
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:07,855
Get me Fillmore and Hayes!

856
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:10,441
-Don't tell them about Grover.
-Why not?

857
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:13,361
Things are bad enough
without us getting blamed...

858
01:04:13,444 --> 01:04:15,822
...for killing that old midget
at the wax museum.

859
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:19,534
-Maybe we should tell them the truth.
-Yeah, right.

860
01:04:19,617 --> 01:04:23,037
Like they'll believe it started
'cause we kidnapped Muffin's turd.

861
01:04:23,913 --> 01:04:26,666
There you are. Get in here! Sit down!

862
01:04:31,045 --> 01:04:33,715
The days of dicking Dewey are over.

863
01:04:33,965 --> 01:04:37,552
We found the kidnapper.
Your partner extraordinaire...

864
01:04:37,635 --> 01:04:39,345
...he's in our custody.

865
01:04:39,429 --> 01:04:41,973
So, tell me all about Roger.

866
01:04:43,266 --> 01:04:44,142
Who?

867
01:04:44,642 --> 01:04:46,269
Oh, no.

868
01:04:46,728 --> 01:04:48,604
You can't play those games anymore.

869
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,773
We nailed him with marked bills.

870
01:04:50,857 --> 01:04:53,151
All that $5 million was traceable.

871
01:04:53,234 --> 01:04:55,320
What $5 million? Miss Crock never paid.

872
01:04:57,363 --> 01:04:59,699
What do you mean, she never paid?

873
01:05:03,786 --> 01:05:04,912
l don't know.

874
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:07,415
You just said Miss Crock never paid.

875
01:05:07,498 --> 01:05:09,208
What do you mean, she never paid?

876
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:12,128
-l didn't say that.
-You did. l heard you say that.

877
01:05:12,211 --> 01:05:13,921
You said, ''Miss Crock never paid.''

878
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:15,757
l wanna know what you meant by that.

879
01:05:17,508 --> 01:05:19,886
-l don't know.
-What did you mean by that?

880
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:22,680
What did you mean,
Miss Crock never paid?

881
01:05:22,764 --> 01:05:24,307
What did he mean by that?

882
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:31,689
What the hell are you doing?
That man's a cop!

883
01:05:32,482 --> 01:05:34,025
l was scared.

884
01:05:34,192 --> 01:05:37,946
Every time you're scared,
you hit a guy with a desk lamp!

885
01:05:39,948 --> 01:05:41,574
l'm getting out of here.

886
01:05:49,165 --> 01:05:51,960
-Who gave you the marked money?
-l don't know!

887
01:05:52,043 --> 01:05:54,796
lt was change in a restaurant.

888
01:05:55,004 --> 01:05:58,424
lf you don't tell us,
you're spending three years in hard labor.

889
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:01,928
lt was Chip Oswald.

890
01:06:08,935 --> 01:06:10,436
Come on!

891
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:22,907
Willard, this is a cop car.
Should we really be taking a cop car?

892
01:06:23,866 --> 01:06:25,451
l'm gonna kill you!

893
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:28,663
Put your ass to the gas! Go!

894
01:06:33,001 --> 01:06:35,712
-Where are we going?
-l don't know!

895
01:06:41,342 --> 01:06:43,886
Shit. We're not making things any better.

896
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:46,681
We gotta find Miss Crock and Grover
and clear this up.

897
01:06:46,764 --> 01:06:49,100
How we gonna do that?
We know nothing about him.

898
01:06:49,183 --> 01:06:52,895
We don't know where he lives, how
to reach him. He's a complete mystery.

899
01:06:52,979 --> 01:06:55,523
Hold on. l got an idea.

900
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,736
Directory assistance. What city?

901
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:02,488
Pittsburgh. Grover Cleaver.

902
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:05,283
-Is that a business or residence?
-Residence.

903
01:07:05,366 --> 01:07:08,036
-Is that Kleaver with a ''K''?
-No, with a ''C''...

904
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:10,163
...like ''cupcake.''

905
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:14,375
Thank you. Press 1 to be connected.

906
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:16,419
Got it.

907
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:23,134
Aloha. You've reached
the Jack Lord Fan Club.

908
01:07:23,426 --> 01:07:26,679
-For membership, send $25...
-l got the Jack Lord Fan Club.

909
01:07:26,763 --> 01:07:28,556
...to the Jack Lord Fan Club.

910
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,476
-Attention: Grover Cleaver.
-Wait! lt's Grover!

911
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:33,978
He lives at 910 Mabley Terrace.

912
01:07:34,062 --> 01:07:37,273
Mabley Terrace?
That's a shitty neighborhood.

913
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:44,238
Damn it! Turn around!

914
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,834
We got away!

915
01:08:02,006 --> 01:08:05,969
As you can see from oursky-cam
they are traveling in a stolen police car.

916
01:08:06,052 --> 01:08:08,721
Again, to recap for those viewers
just tuning in...

917
01:08:08,805 --> 01:08:12,892
...less than 15 minutes ago the two
key suspects in the Crock kidnapping...

918
01:08:12,976 --> 01:08:15,103
...escaped from a downtown police station.

919
01:08:15,186 --> 01:08:17,522
We'll stay with this story
until its conclusion.

920
01:08:27,991 --> 01:08:30,576
Here we go. l got it all.

921
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,162
Here it is.

922
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,708
One box of Fixodent.

923
01:08:38,918 --> 01:08:42,672
One bag of prunes for the old chute.

924
01:08:44,132 --> 01:08:47,343
And four pounds of lamb and rice...

925
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:48,720
...Dog Chow!

926
01:08:48,803 --> 01:08:50,221
That's for you.

927
01:08:51,347 --> 01:08:52,932
Where's my Ben-Gay?

928
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:57,395
You forgot my Ben-Gay, didn't you?
You know my muscles get sore!

929
01:08:57,478 --> 01:09:00,523
''You know my muscles get sore.''
Zip it, you nag!

930
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:04,444
l wish l never met that dang chauffeur.

931
01:09:04,652 --> 01:09:07,780
Come on. The first rule of life, Blackie:

932
01:09:07,947 --> 01:09:09,616
''Never do no favors.''

933
01:09:09,699 --> 01:09:12,744
You call kidnapping a man
doing him a favor?

934
01:09:13,578 --> 01:09:16,831
l didn't kidnap that guy.
He kidnapped himself.

935
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:20,835
What did you say?

936
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,387
You ain't gonna take me alive!

937
01:09:45,068 --> 01:09:45,735
Grover!

938
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:52,492
-Jesus Christ!
-Why is he shooting at us?

939
01:09:52,575 --> 01:09:54,827
He thinks we're the police!

940
01:09:56,454 --> 01:10:00,875
Grover, we are not the police!
We are not the police!

941
01:10:02,293 --> 01:10:04,921
Try to fool stupid Grover, huh?

942
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:06,422
l'll show ya!

943
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:15,807
-Grover, it's us!
-Don't shoot!

944
01:10:17,266 --> 01:10:19,477
lt's you guys. Come on up!

945
01:10:20,228 --> 01:10:21,896
Hurry up! Hurry up!

946
01:10:24,065 --> 01:10:27,902
-Any word yet on that car?
-Yeah, it's been spotted on Mabley Terrace.

947
01:10:28,027 --> 01:10:30,697
Mabley Terrace? Jesus.

948
01:10:31,322 --> 01:10:32,949
l'll need some backup. Let's go!

949
01:10:33,324 --> 01:10:37,370
Grover, you have to let Miss Crock go.
Too much shit's going on.

950
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:40,498
No way! l'm out $18 for groceries.

951
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:41,791
What?

952
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:45,336
-Here's $20, all right?
-l can't break no $20.

953
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,922
-Keep the change!
-All right.

954
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:55,430
-Miss Crock, we're here to rescue you.
-How dare you kidnap yourself!

955
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:59,475
You tried to swindle me?

956
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:03,021
l am going to have your ass!

957
01:11:03,396 --> 01:11:06,274
-Miss Crock, l'm sorry.
-What nerve!

958
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:08,943
After all l've done for you.

959
01:11:09,027 --> 01:11:12,780
l was under a lot of pressure, and l....

960
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:17,076
After all you've done for me?

961
01:11:21,456 --> 01:11:24,834
Willard Fillmore,
the building is surrounded!

962
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:28,004
What exactly, Miss Crock,
did you ever do for me?

963
01:11:28,087 --> 01:11:31,507
l've been your slave for 15 years!
l worked my butt off!

964
01:11:31,591 --> 01:11:35,386
And then, when l got kidnapped,
you wouldn't even pay the ransom money!

965
01:11:35,595 --> 01:11:38,056
Well, after all, you...

966
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:41,225
-...were just a hired servant.
-Hired....

967
01:11:42,018 --> 01:11:45,605
Well, does a hired servant
watch TV with you when you're lonely?

968
01:11:45,813 --> 01:11:50,443
Does a hired servant read to you
that time you broke your glasses?

969
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,614
Does a hired servant visit you
in the hospital when nobody else does?

970
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:57,492
l did everything my father would've.

971
01:12:01,663 --> 01:12:02,997
Not everything.

972
01:12:05,124 --> 01:12:08,836
Your father was, a very special man.

973
01:12:09,963 --> 01:12:14,050
He provided extra services.

974
01:12:16,511 --> 01:12:18,471
Oh, my God.

975
01:12:18,596 --> 01:12:21,724
Your dad didn't say,
''Stick with Miss Crock. You'll get ahead.''

976
01:12:21,808 --> 01:12:25,395
He said, ''Stick with Miss Crock
and you'll get head.''

977
01:12:25,478 --> 01:12:29,023
Would you butt out? We're talking here!

978
01:12:29,107 --> 01:12:30,692
Yuck!

979
01:12:31,943 --> 01:12:34,487
Let's move!

980
01:12:38,783 --> 01:12:41,035
-Can you see them?
-They're on the third floor.

981
01:12:41,869 --> 01:12:42,870
Oh, man!

982
01:12:42,954 --> 01:12:45,081
That's why l couldn't compare to my dad?

983
01:12:45,164 --> 01:12:48,459
Now, don't be silly. lt's just that...

984
01:12:48,543 --> 01:12:51,838
...your father was very gifted.

985
01:12:51,921 --> 01:12:55,008
-That's some big shoes to fill.
-l don't wanna hear this!

986
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:58,177
Man, you must've been a total let down.

987
01:12:58,261 --> 01:13:00,847
No wonder she ransomed you
with an empty suitcase.

988
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:03,349
That suitcase wasn't empty.

989
01:13:04,851 --> 01:13:06,227
l paid every cent.

990
01:13:06,311 --> 01:13:09,230
Then why do Roger and Chip
have the money?

991
01:13:09,314 --> 01:13:11,691
Roger and Chip?

992
01:13:14,694 --> 01:13:18,531
Stop! Don't shoot!
They're stupid and confused!

993
01:13:18,615 --> 01:13:21,034
Position! Move out!

994
01:13:21,117 --> 01:13:23,536
-l'm going in.
-Come on!

995
01:13:23,995 --> 01:13:25,747
l can't believe it.

996
01:13:25,955 --> 01:13:31,169
l can't believe Chip shafted me.

997
01:13:31,753 --> 01:13:33,338
l can't believe you came through.

998
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:35,006
Beaver team, move in! Go!

999
01:13:39,302 --> 01:13:41,220
lt's like an army out there.

1000
01:13:42,513 --> 01:13:45,808
l'm on parole for mail fraud. l gotta hide.

1001
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,734
-How'd you get in there, man?
-l mean...

1002
01:13:54,817 --> 01:13:56,694
-Come on, Grover!
-...l...

1003
01:13:56,778 --> 01:14:01,532
...took care of all of Chip's gambling debts.

1004
01:14:02,116 --> 01:14:05,828
l paid for all his methadone treatments.

1005
01:14:07,455 --> 01:14:09,832
l guess we both got the big screw.

1006
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:13,294
Come on, Grover!

1007
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:16,798
Don't move! Hayes and Fillmore...

1008
01:14:16,881 --> 01:14:20,385
...you're under arrest, again,
for the abduction of Virginia Crock.

1009
01:14:20,468 --> 01:14:22,762
And this time, it's gonna stick!

1010
01:14:24,931 --> 01:14:27,266
You clod.

1011
01:14:27,725 --> 01:14:30,228
They didn't kidnap me.

1012
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:32,855
They rescued me.

1013
01:14:33,273 --> 01:14:37,735
lf Willard hadn't shown up,
l'd be dead and buried in this hellhole!

1014
01:14:38,236 --> 01:14:41,864
l don't understand.
Then who's the kidnapper?

1015
01:14:46,452 --> 01:14:49,372
First, l wanna upgrade the assembly line.

1016
01:14:49,455 --> 01:14:52,208
Toss out minced meat.

1017
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:54,252
Bring in vanilla custard.

1018
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:58,798
Then, l'm gonna mix
strawberry into the rhubarb.

1019
01:15:03,261 --> 01:15:05,805
Freeze! You're under arrest.

1020
01:15:07,307 --> 01:15:08,725
Chip Oswald...

1021
01:15:08,808 --> 01:15:12,854
...you are under arrest for the kidnappings
of Willard Fillmore and Virginia Crock.

1022
01:15:12,937 --> 01:15:16,399
That is ridiculous! How dare you!

1023
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:19,027
l demand you leave my house!

1024
01:15:25,283 --> 01:15:27,619
Put on your pants. You're going to jail.

1025
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:30,371
All right, let's get them hands
behind your back.

1026
01:15:31,623 --> 01:15:34,334
Oh, my God! lt's the new Village People.

1027
01:15:35,376 --> 01:15:37,462
-You're all crazy!
-Put down that gun!

1028
01:15:37,545 --> 01:15:40,298
-l'm not going back to prison!
-What do you mean...

1029
01:15:40,381 --> 01:15:42,008
-...''back''?
-Up yours!

1030
01:15:42,091 --> 01:15:46,721
l've got nothing from all of those years
of suffering, working for you!

1031
01:15:46,804 --> 01:15:49,098
-Nobody does.
-Stay out of this!

1032
01:15:50,099 --> 01:15:52,185
l'll see you all in hell!

1033
01:15:52,727 --> 01:15:55,772
l'll slice you and l'll dice you...

1034
01:15:55,855 --> 01:15:58,775
...and l'll bake you all into meat pies!

1035
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:09,327
Well, it's an ugly ending,
but the case is solved.

1036
01:16:09,535 --> 01:16:12,288
l knew he was the kidnapper
the whole time.

1037
01:16:12,497 --> 01:16:15,667
Never trust a black man named Chip.

1038
01:16:22,465 --> 01:16:24,759
This is so beautiful.

1039
01:16:25,593 --> 01:16:28,680
-l could spend the rest of my life here.
-Yeah.

1040
01:16:28,763 --> 01:16:31,808
And we found a place
where almost everyone speaks English.

1041
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:45,488
There's my juicy, succulent chicken.
Come here.

1042
01:16:46,322 --> 01:16:48,866
-How's business, baby?
-Great, Rusty.

1043
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,910
You guys got a package.

1044
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:55,039
Look.

1045
01:16:55,456 --> 01:16:57,041
lt's from Miss Crock.

1046
01:16:57,667 --> 01:16:59,502
What did she send?

1047
01:17:02,964 --> 01:17:06,634
-Check it out. lt's an Armani suit.
-And there's a letter.

1048
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:15,184
''Dear Willard, I hope you're enjoying
your retirement money.

1049
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:19,606
''Here's a suityou can wear
when you graduate from U.S.C.

1050
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:23,651
''Back in Pittsburgh,
I decided not to sell the company.

1051
01:17:23,735 --> 01:17:27,614
''And I have a new man in my life.

1052
01:17:28,364 --> 01:17:30,408
''Grover's quite special.

1053
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:35,121
''He's a little slow,
but he does what he's told.

1054
01:17:35,455 --> 01:17:38,708
''So, thanks again forintroducing us.

1055
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:42,003
''Your everlasting friend, Virginia.''
