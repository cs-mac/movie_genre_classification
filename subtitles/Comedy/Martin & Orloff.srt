All aboard!
Good morning.

2
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:07,788
Good morning.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:11,593
Good morning.

4
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:13,711
How long
to pittsburgh?

5
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:15,571
10 hours
to pittsburgh.

6
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:17,631
Is there
a bar car on here?

7
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:19,500
Thanks.
On your left.

8
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,086
Madam,
traveling alone?

9
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:21,937
All alone.

10
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:23,922
Shall I wake you
for pittsburgh?

11
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:25,007
No. I'm going
to new york.

12
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:26,508
The big apple.

13
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:27,310
Right.

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,911
Thank you,
and good night.

15
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:30,512
Thank you.
Good night.

16
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,426
Please don't scream.

17
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,546
I just want you to go
to sleep. Please!

18
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:51,863
Please!

19
00:03:57,869 --> 00:04:01,906
Son of a bitch.

20
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:05,293
Are you some sort of freak
rapist asshole? Ah!

21
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,244
Fucker!

22
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:09,830
Son of a...Uh!

23
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,839
Aah!

24
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,993
Don't scream.

25
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:23,345
Aah! Aah!

26
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,850
Don't...Don't scream.

27
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:42,600
What was
in that needle?

28
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,336
What was in it?
Tell me.

29
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:49,123
Damn it. Why won't you
say something to me?

30
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:51,626
What the hell
do you want?

31
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:55,130
Do you want money?
Do you want money?

32
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,298
You can have
what you want.

33
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,384
I have
a lot of money.

34
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,361
What was in that
shot you gave me?

35
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,862
It's all right.

36
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:12,366
I'm always very careful
with the needles.

37
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,867
It won't hurt you.

38
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,770
What do you mean you're
always very careful?

39
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,872
It won't hurt you.
It's just to help you sleep.

40
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:19,372
Tell me what
was in the shot!

41
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:20,873
It's just
to help you sleep!

42
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:22,276
Why don't you just
take what you want?

43
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:23,877
It's important.
Don't you understand?

44
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,881
It's important to me!
It's important to me!

45
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:26,882
Aah!

46
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:32,719
I'm always very careful
with the needles...

47
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,472
so it puts you to sleep

48
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:38,920
And it doesn't hurt.

49
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,565
It's very important.

50
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,096
Porter: pittsburgh!

51
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:06,798
Pittsburgh!

52
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,384
Wooh,
where could she be?

53
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,220
Joyce.

54
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,356
Porter: don't pound
on that door.

55
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:16,160
There's people sleeping
in there.

56
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,644
Wowe're looking
for a friend of ours.

57
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:20,730
We've been up and down
this whole...

58
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:21,732
Joyce!
Joyce!

59
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,735
You look fabulous.

60
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:28,239
And your hair
is longer.

61
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,740
Oh, god. Ok.

62
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:32,743
Denise is gonna
meet us in new york.

63
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,044
Yeah, she's gonna be

64
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:36,047
At the station
when we get there.

65
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:39,751
so I spend the night alone
and wake up to this?

66
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:43,137
Another creep.
Watch your hands.

67
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:46,807
You're
Martin madahas?

68
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,978
I'm cuda. Come.

69
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:51,564
We must take
another train.

70
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,485
Porter: braddock.

71
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:00,498
Nosferatu.

72
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:08,423
Nosferatu.

73
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:14,595
Vampire.

74
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:18,549
First, I will
save your soul.

75
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,471
Then I will destroy you.

76
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,225
I will show you
your room.

77
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:32,680
You may come and go,

78
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,465
But you will not take people
from this city.

79
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:38,269
If I hear of it,
a single time,

80
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:41,471
I will destroy you
without salvation.

81
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,112
You may not enter
my room.

82
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:50,315
When I wish to speak
with you, I will.

83
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,567
My granddaughter
stays with me.

84
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,819
You will not enter
her room.

85
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,414
I have told her
not to speak with you,

86
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,209
But she will.
You will not answer.

87
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,794
Tomorrow you may rest.

88
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:05,099
Next day
you work in my shop.

89
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,383
I have been told
you are imbecile.

90
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:08,885
Can you speak?

91
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:14,258
Speak, so I can hear
your voice.

92
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,143
Speak, nosferatu.

93
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:23,266
Nosferatu.

94
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,281
You will not enter
my room, nosferatu.

95
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,933
You will not
enter my room!

96
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,587
You will not take
family blood.

97
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:44,089
There isn't any magic!
There isn't any magic!

98
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,760
It's just a sickness.

99
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,846
Nosferatu.

100
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:59,939
Nosferatu.

101
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,442
I am your cousin.

102
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:05,313
I am
your cousin Martin.

103
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:16,876
You see?

104
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,582
You see?

105
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:28,087
It isn't magic.

106
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,977
Even I know that.

107
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:39,600
It isn't magic.

108
00:18:58,503 --> 00:18:59,804
Ok, ladies.
I'm sorry.

109
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,507
You know,
i never miss a day,

110
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,510
In 43 years.

111
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,433
I'm sorry I was late
today, ladies.

112
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,186
You need help
here, cuda.

113
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:17,273
Well, my cousin arrived today
from indianapolis.

114
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:20,443
You'll see him here.
He's going to help me.

115
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:22,027
Oh, isn't that nice?
Is he old like you?

116
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,779
Old like all of us,
you mean.

117
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,316
How long has it been since
a young man moved into braddock?

118
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:28,802
Actually, he is a young man...
Not even 20.

119
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,254
A young man in the house
with christina?

120
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,706
Related or not,
i don't think it's right.

121
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:34,574
But, mrs. Bellini...

122
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,086
You shouldn't have it, cuda.
How will it look?

123
00:19:37,286 --> 00:19:39,797
It looks as you want it
to look, mrs. Bellini.

124
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,666
My family knows
how to behave.

125
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:18,956
Uh, you must be Martin.

126
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:24,512
Is, uh...
is tada cuda home yet?

127
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,951
Hey.
What's happening?

128
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,806
Oh. Hi, Martin.

129
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,647
We're having
stuffed cabbage tonight.

130
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,232
Do you like it?

131
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,188
Do you like
stuffed cabbage?

132
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,910
Well, it's
tada cuda's favorite,

133
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,694
And around here,
things are done his way.

134
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,866
What? What?

135
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:35,456
I couldn't hear you.

136
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:40,209
Oh, I didn't know
you were listening.

137
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:41,711
That's a crazy talk show.

138
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:45,450
On all night,
from 6:00 to 6:00.

139
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,819
I'd call him
if we had a phone.

140
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,188
Can you believe
that...No phone?

141
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:54,274
Well, tada cuda and i
had a terrible fight

142
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:55,893
About it last week,

143
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:58,364
And i'm gonna have one
put in my room...

144
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,699
as long
as I pay for it

145
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,202
And as long as the bell
doesn't ring too loud.

146
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:14,330
Say, would you like
to have a phone?

147
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:16,832
I mean, an extension could
only be a few dollars more,

148
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:18,800
And I could make
the arrangements for you,

149
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:22,972
And we could share the expenses
at the end of the month.

150
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:26,060
Well...

151
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,844
you let me know
if you want one, ok?

152
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:43,111
Look how he eats.

153
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:24,989
Put your finger
in there.

154
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,352
Go ahead.

155
00:23:30,552 --> 00:23:32,246
Oh, I can't.

156
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:33,648
Try it.

157
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,250
No. I...

158
00:23:36,752 --> 00:23:38,637
i can't put
my finger in it.

159
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:47,596
Aah! Ha ha ha!

160
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:49,181
Wow. That's
really great.

161
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:50,651
See, it has
2 blades...

162
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:52,953
A real one
and a slip blade.

163
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,605
You hold the real one
and pull the slip blade up.

164
00:23:57,774 --> 00:24:00,526
Things only seem
to be magic.

165
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:02,512
There is
no real magic.

166
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:04,698
There's no
real magic ever.

167
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,554
Hello, cuda.

168
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:11,556
hello, arthur.

169
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:15,760
Oh, arthur,
this is my cousin.

170
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,844
Arthur thelanus,
Martin.

171
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:18,015
hello, Martin.

172
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:20,574
Indianapolis, huh?
It's a good town.

173
00:24:20,774 --> 00:24:22,855
Well, I hear
there's work there.

174
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:24,937
There's work
everywhere, arthur.

175
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,639
People just don't
bother to look for it.

176
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,776
I'm talking about
decent work

177
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:31,227
With decent money.

178
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:38,484
Christine: let's go
over to your place, ok?

179
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:40,487
i'm tired.
Let's just watch the game here.

180
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,072
Cuda will like that.

181
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,908
Come on.
What about me?

182
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,491
I promised him.

183
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:46,794
He's been bugging me
for all this time.

184
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:48,495
He says, "you never spend
any time around here."

185
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:50,498
I think he think
we're off someplace...you know.

186
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,501
What about me?
You don't seem to ever

187
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,503
Want to spend any time
with me anymore.

188
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,505
We spend
our lives in bed!

189
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,306
We do not.

190
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:01,009
That's not the way it is,
and you know that.

191
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,811
Just relax.

192
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:06,098
Can't you just
relax here?

193
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:07,400
No, I can't
relax here.

194
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,768
I'll just watch, like,
the first half with him.

195
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,353
I'm so sick of you,

196
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:13,630
This whole place,
everyone here.

197
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,107
All you want to do
is sit down

198
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:16,410
And watch the games

199
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,612
And just let everything
just pass by.

200
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:21,415
We have to get
in the car,

201
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:23,616
And we have to drive
all the way out there.

202
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:25,117
It's even
more exhausting.

203
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:26,919
Oh, come on.
Give me a break!

204
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,005
Just forget it.

205
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,926
Nosferatu.

206
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:37,061
Oh, you must be Martin.

207
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:38,881
Just a minute, son.

208
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,417
I'll get my purse.
Go around to the side.

209
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:43,670
Go around to the side.

210
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,438
This is
for the meat.

211
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:05,943
And this is
for you, Martin.

212
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:07,311
Ok?

213
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:26,832
Well, that was quick.

214
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:30,303
I didn't expect you
till later this afternoon.

215
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:32,021
It's good
that you caught me.

216
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:34,590
I was just gonna run
down to the state store.

217
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:45,986
Thank you.

218
00:27:56,081 --> 00:27:57,465
I can give you

219
00:27:57,665 --> 00:28:01,503
A ride back downtown
if you'd like.

220
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:04,455
Why not?
It's such a long way.

221
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,266
Let's go.

222
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,321
This is
really something...

223
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:21,024
Coming all the way up here
to deliver this stuff.

224
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:24,028
Now I deliver you
all the way back downtown.

225
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:30,783
I could have
picked it up myself.

226
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:34,790
It's too bad you had
to walk all the way up.

227
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,145
Have you got a minute?
I need gas.

228
00:28:57,146 --> 00:28:58,531
can I help you?

229
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:01,150
Woyes. A dollar's worth
of regular, please.

230
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,571
My husband puts in
all the mileage

231
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:07,073
When he's out gallivanting
around with the girls.

232
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:08,657
So i'm not gonna use
my money

233
00:29:08,658 --> 00:29:10,360
To fill up the tank
for him.

234
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:12,446
I don't get enough
as it is.

235
00:29:14,331 --> 00:29:16,334
Yeah, I know you
have to get back.

236
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:19,285
It'll just be
a minute.

237
00:29:19,286 --> 00:29:21,372
Would you reach over there
in the glove compartment

238
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,709
And give me the little
notebook that's in there.

239
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:26,293
In the glove
compartment.

240
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:29,297
There's a little
notebook in there.

241
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:34,070
Thanks.

242
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,214
My husband's
a fanatic about this...

243
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:40,359
How much gas, when,
what's the mileage.

244
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,276
I'm sorry.

245
00:29:42,277 --> 00:29:45,532
I'm the complaining
old housewife.

246
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:48,985
If you don't like it,
get out.

247
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:52,906
Hey, I don't mean you.
I mean me.

248
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:54,489
If i'm so dissatisfied,

249
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,493
I should
just get out of it

250
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:58,496
And shut up
about it.

251
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:05,803
You remind me of an old
cat I used to have.

252
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:07,753
I don't mean that
to sound funny.

253
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:09,556
I had
an old alley cat,

254
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,141
And he used to sit
on the floor

255
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,145
And stare up at me
with those eyes.

256
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,147
I really
used to be able

257
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,949
To talk
to that old cat.

258
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,300
And he'd just
listen and listen

259
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,653
Till I got it all
out of my system.

260
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,906
He never said
anything either,

261
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,491
Never talked back.

262
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,498
Wow.

263
00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:52,636
Thank you.

264
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:57,776
Say, do you do
any other jobs...

265
00:30:57,976 --> 00:31:01,362
Yardwork, handy-Work,
stuff like that?

266
00:31:01,363 --> 00:31:04,699
Well, maybe we can work
something out.

267
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,453
See you next week.

268
00:31:39,988 --> 00:31:41,289
Christina: it's crazy.

269
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,600
I can't believe
this is happening.

270
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,711
It's a nightmare,
for you and him!

271
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,412
Your father was not
from our part of the world.

272
00:31:48,413 --> 00:31:49,997
Your mother knew.

273
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:51,582
She believed.

274
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,153
Well, if she did,
then thank god

275
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:54,721
I was too little
to know her.

276
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:57,673
Martin had his father
until he was 32.

277
00:31:57,674 --> 00:32:00,283
Grandfather,
he is just a boy!

278
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:03,094
Look in the books,
christina.

279
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:04,096
We have the books
of the family.

280
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:05,899
Did you ever look?

281
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:08,135
Of course, the books.
The books will show it.

282
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,288
Those damn books...
They should be burned!

283
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:12,439
That's where you get
your horrible ideas!

284
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,974
Ask the boy himself.
Ask Martin. He will tell you.

285
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,560
He's unbalanced.
He's mad.

286
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,564
And you and those books
have driven him to it!

287
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:20,866
He is nosferatu.

288
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,650
He was born
to elena borassa

289
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,153
And rudy mathias
in the old country

290
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,338
In 1892.

291
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:30,208
He is young
for nosferatu.

292
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:34,246
There have been 9
such accursed in the family.

293
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:36,214
There are 3 still alive.

294
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,716
Martin is one.

295
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,469
Count demodeli is the eldest
in the family now.

296
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,356
From the old country,
he sends the letters

297
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:46,559
Telling who will take
the company into their house.

298
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:50,229
We obey, first
for the family shame,

299
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,816
And again because,
to defy the evil ones

300
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:55,186
Is to bring a curse
upon oneself.

301
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:57,905
I will not shame
the family,

302
00:32:58,105 --> 00:33:00,356
But the devil...
the devil can take my soul.

303
00:33:00,556 --> 00:33:01,940
I would have
destroyed the children

304
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:04,445
The moment they
showed the signs.

305
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:07,916
Elena borassa took
her own life instead.

306
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:12,370
Now...Martin comes to me.

307
00:33:14,755 --> 00:33:17,343
People cannot come
to other people's beliefs.

308
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:22,130
It's hard for you, I know.
It's hard for anyone young.

309
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:25,216
Do you believe
that god's whole world

310
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:27,220
Runs by the laws
of the few sciences

311
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,663
We have been able
to discover?

312
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:32,108
Oh, no, christina.
There is more.

313
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:33,410
But people
are satisfied.

314
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,613
They know so much,
they think they know all.

315
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:39,299
And that makes it
easy for nosferatu.

316
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:41,985
That makes it easy
for all the devils.

317
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:50,879
Damn him.

318
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,699
Here. Let me help.

319
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,518
No. It's my job.

320
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:58,803
I just want
to help, all right?

321
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:01,306
No. It's my job.

322
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,760
Mind if I turn
this off?

323
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,742
I'm glad you don't
believe in the magic.

324
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:23,246
Well, I don't.
I really don't.

325
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:26,166
I know, and i'm glad.

326
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,204
I'm sorry that you have
to go through it all.

327
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:33,207
I know it must be
awful for you.

328
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,292
It is. It is awful.

329
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,062
Tada cuda. Ah, he's...

330
00:34:37,262 --> 00:34:39,130
As long as it
doesn't get crazy.

331
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:41,515
Sometimes
they get crazy.

332
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:43,769
How old are you,
Martin?

333
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,395
Oh, i'm old.

334
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:47,022
How old?

335
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:49,392
84.

336
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:00,153
Listen, I would really
like to help you.

337
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:03,874
Would you like
to see a doctor?

338
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:05,457
I've seen
lots of doctors.

339
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,042
They don't know
what to do either.

340
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:08,627
You shouldn't be
with the family.

341
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:09,929
Maybe you should be

342
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:11,999
In a hospital
or a home or something.

343
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,584
No. That would be
too hard for me.

344
00:35:13,585 --> 00:35:15,303
Well, I think that
this is hard for you,

345
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:16,886
And I think
that if the family

346
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:18,004
Really wanted
to help you,

347
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:20,224
That that's what
they should do.

348
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:22,676
They're crazy! They're
the ones that are...

349
00:35:24,262 --> 00:35:27,066
I'm sorry.
Ah, it's just that...

350
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:30,268
well, I grew up in this
entire thing, too.

351
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:32,070
Nosferatu. Nosferatu.

352
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,772
The family curse.
The family shame.

353
00:35:34,773 --> 00:35:36,576
It's the middle ages!

354
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:39,362
Do you know,
i heard about this

355
00:35:39,363 --> 00:35:41,215
My entire life?

356
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:42,998
Sometimes I even
start thinking

357
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:45,418
That i'm gonna believe
all that bullshit.

358
00:35:45,618 --> 00:35:48,088
I couldn't go
to a hospital.

359
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:51,774
That would be
too hard for me.

360
00:35:51,974 --> 00:35:55,461
I'll be fine.
I'm always fine.

361
00:35:57,264 --> 00:35:59,308
Damn him.

362
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:01,352
Listen...

363
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:03,136
i really want to
talk to you

364
00:36:03,137 --> 00:36:05,022
Some more
about this, ok?

365
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:07,232
No, I mean I really
want to talk to you,

366
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,643
And maybe even we can
sit grandfather down

367
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:11,229
And talk to him.

368
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,131
I'll talk to you,
not to him.

369
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,233
All right.
That's all right.

370
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:21,706
Sure you don't
want me to help?

371
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:25,077
Well, i'm gonna go wait
out on the back porch.

372
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:27,580
If arthur comes,
i'm gonna go ahead and leave.

373
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,998
See you later.

374
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:32,134
I'd like to have
a phone.

375
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:35,721
I would really like
to have a phone.

376
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:37,307
How about that game
on sunday, man?

377
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:39,310
It was pretty close.
It could have gone either way.

378
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,112
We put your phones
in upstairs

379
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:43,813
And left the phone books
up there for you.

380
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:45,064
Thank you.

381
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:46,851
Christina, shouting:
what do you think I am?

382
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:48,352
What do you
think I am?

383
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:49,853
Oh, i'm so sick of you!

384
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,858
I'm so sick of your attitude
towards me!

385
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:54,660
I'm important,
and i'm tired...

386
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,028
I'm tired of waiting
on that damn porch!

387
00:36:57,029 --> 00:36:58,413
Don't give me that.

388
00:36:58,613 --> 00:37:00,865
I don't want
to hear you say that!

389
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:03,618
I don't care where
you were this time.

390
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:04,703
Where were you last week?

391
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:06,547
Where were you
the week before that?

392
00:37:06,747 --> 00:37:08,210
Do you think
i don't hear things?

393
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,875
I don't ever ask you,
now, do i?

394
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:10,877
Do I ever accuse you
of anything?

395
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:12,778
I know what you're doing!

396
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:14,680
I don't care.
I don't care!

397
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:55,090
A man and a woman
dancing.

398
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:56,676
This is a man
and a lady in bed?

399
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:57,926
Yeah.
It's only $4.98.

400
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:00,262
I sell
a lot of them.

401
00:38:14,244 --> 00:38:16,413
T.J. Is here,
you know.

402
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:20,202
Let me put your bags
in your car for you.

403
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:21,786
I don't want
no money.

404
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,621
I just want to
help you, baby.

405
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:25,589
That's all I want.

406
00:38:41,723 --> 00:38:43,058
snowcone?

407
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,062
Wosnowcone?
Oh, no snowcone.

408
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:46,563
How about a fudgicle?

409
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:48,248
I think
we're gonna be

410
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:49,749
A few minutes
making up our minds.

411
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:51,450
Maybe you better
take care of this man.

412
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:53,286
Do you have
ice cream sandwiches?

413
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:55,238
A sandwich? One?

414
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:18,681
Hello.

415
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,352
who is it,
honey?

416
00:39:24,353 --> 00:39:25,436
Oh, jesus.

417
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:27,022
Do you have anything?

418
00:39:27,023 --> 00:39:29,543
Uh...do you
have anything?

419
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,327
I only give to
organized charities.

420
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:33,112
He can't hear you,
you schmuck.

421
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:35,331
Jesus.

422
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,957
All right?
Come on.

423
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:39,313
Thank you.
Ha ha ha!

424
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:41,672
I mean, uh...
good luck.

425
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,459
Ok?

426
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:31,508
Wocall me when you know
where you'll be, ok?

427
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:33,143
As soon as I know,
i'll call, all right?

428
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:35,463
Don't do anything
i wouldn't do.

429
00:40:35,663 --> 00:40:37,983
You know me
better than that.

430
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:26,318
Woman's voice: Martin.

431
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:30,871
Martin.

432
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:39,966
Martin.

433
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:03,409
Worichard?

434
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,500
Richard?

435
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:45,432
Woman's voice: Martin.

436
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,722
Martin.

437
00:43:56,696 --> 00:43:58,197
Martin.

438
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:31,516
Echoing: Martin...

439
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:38,156
Martin...

440
00:44:49,669 --> 00:44:51,671
echoing: Martin...

441
00:45:09,475 --> 00:45:12,643
ok.

442
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:13,903
Who are you?

443
00:45:14,103 --> 00:45:15,362
Oh, my god. Ah!

444
00:45:15,363 --> 00:45:18,482
Look, let's not get
excited about this.

445
00:45:18,483 --> 00:45:20,569
There's no reason to get
upset or anything, ok?

446
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,073
I don't know him!

447
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:23,957
Aah!

448
00:45:29,629 --> 00:45:30,931
Are you all right?

449
00:45:31,131 --> 00:45:32,632
He shot me
with something.

450
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:34,534
What did
he do to you?

451
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:36,636
I don't know
who he is.

452
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:38,288
Have you
seen him before?

453
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:39,940
He came to the door
one day.

454
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,643
He came to the door,
and he said he was deaf.

455
00:45:42,644 --> 00:45:44,646
He shot me with something.
Better call somebody.

456
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:46,448
I can't call anybody!

457
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:49,149
You're not supposed
to be here!

458
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:50,851
I can't call the police.

459
00:45:50,852 --> 00:45:52,436
Where did he go?

460
00:45:52,437 --> 00:45:53,738
I don't know.

461
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:55,440
I'm not gonna go
out there and look.

462
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:56,625
Call somebody!

463
00:45:56,825 --> 00:45:58,076
Lewis, I can't
call anybody!

464
00:45:58,077 --> 00:45:59,578
You are not supposed
to be here!

465
00:45:59,778 --> 00:46:00,379
What am i
supposed to do?

466
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:01,862
I don't care
who finds out about us!

467
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:04,449
He shot me with something!
Now call somebody!

468
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,035
Call the police, hospital,
ambulance, anybody!

469
00:46:06,036 --> 00:46:06,720
Call somebody!

470
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,706
I don't know
who to call!

471
00:46:12,425 --> 00:46:14,008
Lewis, who
should I call?

472
00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:15,510
The emergency number.
Call 911.

473
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:16,887
I can't call 911.

474
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,465
That's the police.

475
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:20,801
It's not the police! It's just
a general emergency number!

476
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,103
Do you have a friend
i can call?

477
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:25,022
Is your car here?

478
00:46:25,222 --> 00:46:26,555
Yeah.

479
00:46:26,556 --> 00:46:28,140
Call the hospital and tell them
what happened, all right?

480
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:30,477
Tell them we'll be there
in 5 minutes.

481
00:46:30,478 --> 00:46:31,362
Ok. What hospital?

482
00:46:31,562 --> 00:46:32,814
I don't know
what hospital!

483
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:34,148
Is mercy around here?

484
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:35,733
I don't know
the number.

485
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:37,869
Call information.
Get their number. Call them.

486
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:39,369
Information, can you
give me the number

487
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,906
Of mercy hospital,
please?

488
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:43,408
Thank you.

489
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:48,748
Shit! It's fucked up.
Wait a minute.

490
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:50,733
I got to do it again.

491
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:52,718
I can't get through!

492
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,804
I forgot the number!

493
00:46:55,004 --> 00:46:57,223
Wait. Um...

494
00:46:57,423 --> 00:46:58,807
shit.

495
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:01,928
Lewis, are you
on the other phone?

496
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:05,482
Lewis, hang up
the phone!

497
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:11,688
I can't get through.

498
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:13,907
Hang up the phone, would you?
Are you on it?

499
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:16,860
Shit. What's
the number?

500
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:18,195
I forgot the number.

501
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,001
Hang up!

502
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:24,452
All right!

503
00:47:29,175 --> 00:47:30,059
Hang up!

504
00:47:30,259 --> 00:47:31,710
I'm off. I hung up.
I've got my foot on it.

505
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:35,431
Is there another
phone in this house?

506
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:37,199
Downstairs,
in the game room.

507
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:38,967
You keep calling
to get somebody,

508
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:40,686
All right?
Keep calling!

509
00:47:40,886 --> 00:47:42,270
Oh!

510
00:47:42,271 --> 00:47:44,774
Uh...oh, shit.
The number.

511
00:47:59,457 --> 00:48:00,825
Bastard.

512
00:48:06,381 --> 00:48:08,216
Lewis!

513
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,218
Open this door,
you bastard!

514
00:48:10,418 --> 00:48:13,472
You fucker, open
this goddamn door!

515
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:14,422
Lewis, what happened?

516
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,227
Lewis!

517
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,347
Aah!

518
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:57,135
Aah! Aah! Help! Help!

519
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:02,291
No! No!
Get away from me!

520
00:49:02,491 --> 00:49:05,644
No! Stop!
Please! No! Aah!

521
00:49:05,645 --> 00:49:07,446
No! Stop!

522
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:10,049
What did you do to me?

523
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:12,651
What did you
do to me?

524
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:14,154
Get out!

525
00:49:16,156 --> 00:49:19,159
Go away.

526
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:36,594
No!

527
00:49:44,403 --> 00:49:46,904
Lewis! Lewis!
Get away, lewis!

528
00:49:46,905 --> 00:49:48,491
Lewis, he's gonna...

529
00:49:48,691 --> 00:49:51,611
Lewis, don't come in here!
Look out!

530
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:52,995
Oh, lewis!

531
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:03,590
Listen, we've got to
get away from here!

532
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,176
Get on the phone!
Get some help! Get anybody!

533
00:50:06,177 --> 00:50:08,045
I'm gonna get
that fucker!

534
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,671
Hello.

535
00:51:19,672 --> 00:51:21,675
I need help.

536
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:04,469
Don't be afraid.

537
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:07,055
You'll just go to sleep.

538
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:11,177
I don't have to
hurt you now.

539
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:12,261
Aah!

540
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:16,649
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

541
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,452
You'll just
fall asleep,

542
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:21,155
And you'll wake up.
I promise.

543
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:22,957
You'll be all right.

544
00:52:23,157 --> 00:52:25,526
You'll fall asleep
and wake up.

545
00:52:29,497 --> 00:52:32,150
You want me?

546
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:35,003
Yes. Yes.

547
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:39,422
Yes, but i'm not
going to hurt you now

548
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:42,927
Because of him.

549
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:07,654
You weren't supposed
to be there.

550
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:12,043
Why were you there?

551
00:53:14,996 --> 00:53:16,997
You weren't supposed
to be there.

552
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:24,306
You weren't supposed
to be there.

553
00:53:53,454 --> 00:53:54,838
Voice: nosferatu.

554
00:54:01,796 --> 00:54:04,682
Martin's voice:
it gets crazy sometimes,

555
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:06,885
And sometimes I think
they're really gonna catch me

556
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:08,687
And hurt me
or even kill me.

557
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:10,388
Man's voice: yeah,
i've seen that in the movies...

558
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:12,391
People trying
to stop your kind.

559
00:54:16,646 --> 00:54:19,147
Martin's voice:
you have to really stay calm

560
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:21,001
When that happens.

561
00:54:21,201 --> 00:54:22,785
And you just have to remember
that the ones that are after you

562
00:54:22,786 --> 00:54:24,588
Are never calm.

563
00:54:24,788 --> 00:54:27,040
People are never calm
when they're angry.

564
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,493
Man's voice: no, it's true.
It's very true.

565
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:31,076
Martin's voice:
for a long time,

566
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:32,879
I didn't care
if they'd kill me.

567
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:36,666
Most people spend their lives
worrying about dying.

568
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:40,004
For a long time,
i wished I would die,

569
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:42,264
Or I wished
somebody would kill me.

570
00:54:42,464 --> 00:54:44,724
It's been
a long time for me...

571
00:54:44,725 --> 00:54:49,313
a long time
full of crazy people.

572
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:43,538
I'm pretty careful
about not getting caught now.

573
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:48,410
I've learned a lot of things.
I have good tools.

574
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,994
And I have the needles.

575
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:51,497
Man's voice: needles?

576
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:54,501
Martin's voice: it was
really hard before the needles.

577
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:57,503
Man's voice:
what kind of needles?

578
00:55:57,703 --> 00:55:59,004
Count?

579
00:56:39,632 --> 00:56:41,467
Martin's voice: everything's
been pretty easy

580
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:44,554
Since i've learned
how to be careful.

581
00:56:44,555 --> 00:56:46,138
People are
the hardest thing.

582
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:50,611
Man's voice: ha ha ha.
I understand.

583
00:56:53,364 --> 00:56:57,152
When I see people together,
they don't talk, not really.

584
00:56:57,352 --> 00:56:59,653
They don't say
what they mean.

585
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:01,155
Man's voice: right.

586
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:03,791
Martin's voice:
then they have the other,

587
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:06,027
They have
the sexy stuff,

588
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:08,463
Whenever they want it.

589
00:57:17,473 --> 00:57:20,976
I've been much too shy
to ever do the sexy stuff.

590
00:57:20,977 --> 00:57:22,278
Man's voice: mm-Hmm...

591
00:57:22,478 --> 00:57:25,982
Martin's voice: I mean, do it
with someone who was awake.

592
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:27,985
Man's voice: uh...ha ha.

593
00:57:31,488 --> 00:57:34,491
Martin's voice: someday maybe
i'll get to do it...

594
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:36,710
awake, without
the blood part.

595
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:41,916
Just do it with somebody
and then be together

596
00:57:42,116 --> 00:57:44,919
And talk all night.

597
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,935
Man's voice: we've had
questions from our listeners

598
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:01,937
As to how often this happens.
I mean, every full moon?

599
00:58:02,137 --> 00:58:04,439
Martin: I don't know.
I lose track.

600
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,109
Not all the time.

601
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:10,062
That's not like
in the movies either.

602
00:58:10,063 --> 00:58:12,566
I saw a movie once
where it happened every night.

603
00:58:12,765 --> 00:58:15,067
Now, that's crazy.
Those movies are crazy.

604
00:58:15,068 --> 00:58:16,970
oh, so you
mean to tell me,

605
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,072
All those movies
aren't true, huh?

606
00:58:19,272 --> 00:58:20,373
What else isn't true?

607
00:58:20,573 --> 00:58:22,377
Are you gonna dispel
any other myths,

608
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:25,079
Like getting back
to your grave before sunup

609
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,380
Or garlic...

610
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,081
Martin:
it's all crazy.

611
00:58:28,082 --> 00:58:32,586
so you don't burn up
to a crisp in the sunlight?

612
00:58:32,786 --> 00:58:34,088
Nothing like that?

613
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:36,742
Martin: well, the sun
bothers my eyes sometimes,

614
00:58:36,942 --> 00:58:39,394
Especially when it's about time,
when I get shaky.

615
00:58:39,594 --> 00:58:42,096
yeah, well, listen, count,
my sponsor's getting shaky,

616
00:58:42,097 --> 00:58:44,499
So i've got to take a break.
Hang on a minute.

617
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:47,052
Night-Timers, we've been
talking to the count.

618
00:58:47,252 --> 00:58:49,605
Yes, a real, live,
honest-To-Goodness vampire.

619
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:51,106
And if you have
any questions

620
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:52,909
You'd like to pass on
to the count,

621
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:56,612
How about giving me a call
here at 555-1650?

622
00:58:56,812 --> 00:58:59,699
Be back in a moment.

623
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,285
Man's voice on radio:
be back in a moment.

624
00:59:02,286 --> 00:59:04,437
Talk about a sale.
This week's sale at mason's...

625
00:59:04,638 --> 00:59:06,790
Accent storage tables,
some of our best-Selling...

626
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,795
count, are you there?
Hey, count? Count?

627
00:59:10,995 --> 00:59:12,797
Count, are you there, man?

628
00:59:12,997 --> 00:59:14,298
Martin: hello.

629
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:16,100
say, man, where can i
get ahold of you?

630
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,102
This is really going over big.
I mean, it's very good.

631
00:59:18,302 --> 00:59:20,806
We have a lot of people calling,
and they're very interested.

632
00:59:21,006 --> 00:59:22,307
Count, i'd like
to talk to you.

633
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,819
I'd like to have you
come down to the station...

634
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:29,530
Man's voice on radio:
...a 54 by 20 by 16 now $66.

635
00:59:50,388 --> 00:59:53,523
You stay
in my house.

636
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,307
Will you embarrass
me like this?

637
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:56,810
This is
a catholic family.

638
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,813
I will not be seen
in church without you.

639
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,314
Get dressed.

640
01:00:03,435 --> 01:00:05,018
Priest: and jesus
answered them,

641
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:08,523
"Have not I chosen you 12,
and one of you be the devil..."

642
01:00:14,029 --> 01:00:18,366
So ends the gospel
according to saint john.

643
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:21,788
Instead of a sermon today,
i think that we need to discuss

644
01:00:21,988 --> 01:00:26,375
The problem of
rebuilding the church.

645
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,878
Being new to the community,
i've asked deacon roy

646
01:00:29,078 --> 01:00:31,381
To talk to you
about this.

647
01:00:31,382 --> 01:00:32,683
We need
a good bit of money

648
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:34,685
If we hope
to rebuild this parish.

649
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,887
Deacon roy, if you would
address the congregation.

650
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:38,889
Deacon roy: thank you.

651
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:40,557
First of all,

652
01:00:40,558 --> 01:00:43,945
The tragedy of our church
being burned down,

653
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:49,700
I understand, has shaken
some of our parishioners' faith.

654
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:52,620
This need not be.

655
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:57,208
Now is the time
to express your faith.

656
01:00:57,209 --> 01:01:01,214
For example, if we go
to our homes when we leave here

657
01:01:01,414 --> 01:01:05,301
And see things that
we do not use laying around

658
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:07,219
That we can sell,

659
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,805
That's one way
to raise money.

660
01:01:10,005 --> 01:01:11,306
Hold raffles.

661
01:01:11,307 --> 01:01:15,895
And we can all get together
and furnish labor.

662
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:18,482
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.

663
01:01:18,483 --> 01:01:21,051
Will you come up to
the house sometime?

664
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:23,820
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

665
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,321
Thank you very much.

666
01:01:25,322 --> 01:01:28,117
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

667
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:31,112
We will have supper
late tomorrow night.

668
01:01:31,113 --> 01:01:32,613
I invited
the new priest

669
01:01:32,614 --> 01:01:34,015
To come to our house
for supper.

670
01:01:34,215 --> 01:01:35,616
You will make
a good dinner.

671
01:02:02,362 --> 01:02:06,450
Sure you wouldn't like
something in that?

672
01:02:08,152 --> 01:02:11,238
You don't mind
if I do, right?

673
01:02:46,526 --> 01:02:49,612
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to frighten you.

674
01:02:49,812 --> 01:02:52,116
It's just that you're...

675
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:56,203
So gentle,

676
01:02:56,204 --> 01:02:59,539
So nice.

677
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,594
I only want
to hold you.

678
01:03:03,794 --> 01:03:07,849
Martin, don't be
so afraid.

679
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,184
The door is finished.

680
01:03:16,442 --> 01:03:19,445
Father curry
was in braddock...42...

681
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:21,948
No, 43 years
before he left.

682
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:24,750
No. Thank you.

683
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,953
I'd like to have
a little more wine.

684
01:03:27,153 --> 01:03:28,821
You like this wine?

685
01:03:28,822 --> 01:03:31,624
Gorinzkas made this wine.
I like it, too.

686
01:03:31,824 --> 01:03:34,628
Gorinzkas. I don't know him.
Is he catholic?

687
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:36,296
A good catholic,
yes, father howard.

688
01:03:36,496 --> 01:03:37,881
But you wouldn't
know him.

689
01:03:37,882 --> 01:03:39,934
He left even
before corelli.

690
01:03:40,134 --> 01:03:41,919
That's too bad.
I would have commissioned him

691
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,921
To make some wine
for the church.

692
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:46,757
I don't suppose
it's sacrilege to say

693
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:49,594
That the wine at st. Vincent's
is putrid.

694
01:03:49,595 --> 01:03:52,180
You were sent here,
or you asked to come?

695
01:03:52,181 --> 01:03:53,874
I was sent
by the diocese

696
01:03:54,074 --> 01:03:55,767
When father corelli
retired.

697
01:03:55,768 --> 01:03:57,369
Retired? Ha!

698
01:03:57,569 --> 01:03:59,654
Father corelli
is younger than I am.

699
01:03:59,655 --> 01:04:02,274
He asked to leave.
He left, like the rest of them.

700
01:04:02,474 --> 01:04:04,910
They think this town
is finished.

701
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:06,913
No. He has cancer.

702
01:04:07,113 --> 01:04:08,831
He's very near
the end.

703
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:10,749
In fact,
i haven't heard.

704
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,835
He may be gone.

705
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:19,810
Oh, thank you.

706
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:24,598
This is a town for
old persons, father howard.

707
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:27,050
You know the things
an old person

708
01:04:27,051 --> 01:04:28,635
Wants from a priest?

709
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:29,904
Oh, this is
very sweet.

710
01:04:30,104 --> 01:04:32,357
An old person
needs a priest

711
01:04:32,557 --> 01:04:35,501
Who thinks the way
the old person thinks,

712
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:38,646
A priest who believes
in the old ways.

713
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:40,649
That's why I use the latin mass
here in braddock.

714
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:43,118
I think
people around here...

715
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:45,537
Do you believe
in demons, father howard?

716
01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:49,575
Do you believe the devil
can enter a person's soul?

717
01:04:50,827 --> 01:04:52,829
I don't know
what to believe about that.

718
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:55,164
You don't know,
father howard? Ha!

719
01:04:55,364 --> 01:04:56,915
You see, this
is what I mean.

720
01:04:57,115 --> 01:04:58,667
This is not
what an old person

721
01:04:58,668 --> 01:05:00,355
Wants to hear
from a priest.

722
01:05:00,555 --> 01:05:01,972
Father howard, would you
like some more cookies?

723
01:05:02,172 --> 01:05:03,473
No, thanks.

724
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:04,975
Can I get you
anything else?

725
01:05:05,175 --> 01:05:07,144
No, no. I'm fine.

726
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:09,679
If our priests cannot
save us from such things,

727
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,864
Who can, father howard?

728
01:05:11,065 --> 01:05:13,517
Well, i've had several
conversations about this

729
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:15,019
With some
of my associates,

730
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:16,821
And I think...

731
01:05:17,021 --> 01:05:18,823
i think it's
a difficult issue.

732
01:05:19,023 --> 01:05:21,608
It's something
that has to be dealt with.

733
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:22,694
Grandfather,
stop it.

734
01:05:22,695 --> 01:05:24,163
You're gonna scare
father howard away.

735
01:05:24,363 --> 01:05:25,747
Fascinating subject,
actually.

736
01:05:25,748 --> 01:05:27,498
You should talk
to father zulemas about this.

737
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:28,384
Father...

738
01:05:28,584 --> 01:05:29,385
zulemas.
Zulemas.

739
01:05:29,585 --> 01:05:31,837
He a great old guy.
He claims to have actually done

740
01:05:32,037 --> 01:05:34,005
The old mystical rites
for real.

741
01:05:34,006 --> 01:05:35,958
He went to see
that film <i>the exorcist.</i>

742
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:38,594
He said they did it
all wrong.

743
01:05:38,595 --> 01:05:39,478
Zulemas.

744
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:42,131
I don't suppose
you saw that movie.

745
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:44,100
I thought
it was great.

746
01:05:50,858 --> 01:05:53,226
Woman's voice: Martin.

747
01:05:53,426 --> 01:05:55,611
Martin.

748
01:06:08,576 --> 01:06:10,913
nosferatu.

749
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,146
I cast you out...

750
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,365
Unclean spirit,

751
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,452
Along with every
satanic power of the enemy,

752
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:21,088
Every sector from hell,

753
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:24,092
And all your felled
companions,

754
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:27,244
In the name of our lord
jesus christ.

755
01:07:27,245 --> 01:07:29,097
It is he
who commands you.

756
01:07:29,297 --> 01:07:32,383
Harken therefore,
and tremble in fear, satan,

757
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:34,334
You enemy of the faith,

758
01:07:34,335 --> 01:07:36,338
You foe
of the human race,

759
01:07:36,538 --> 01:07:38,056
You begetter of death,

760
01:07:38,057 --> 01:07:39,358
You robber of life,

761
01:07:39,558 --> 01:07:41,360
You corrupter
of justice,

762
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,012
You root
of all evil and vice,

763
01:07:44,013 --> 01:07:45,948
Seducer of men,

764
01:07:46,148 --> 01:07:48,316
Betrayer
of the nations...

765
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:54,156
...fountain of avarice,
fomenter of discord,

766
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,959
Author of pain
and sorrow.

767
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,730
Why, then, do you stand
and resist, knowing...

768
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:05,502
that christ our lord
brings your plans to nothing?

769
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:10,757
By the sign of the holy cross
of our lord jesus christ,

770
01:08:10,758 --> 01:08:13,710
Who lives and reigns

771
01:08:13,711 --> 01:08:16,046
With the father
and the holy spirit,

772
01:08:16,047 --> 01:08:18,351
God and forever...

773
01:08:20,352 --> 01:08:21,628
o amen.

774
01:08:21,828 --> 01:08:23,104
Amen.

775
01:08:23,105 --> 01:08:25,690
The lord
be with you all.

776
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:27,384
May he also be
with you.

777
01:08:27,584 --> 01:08:29,277
May he also
be with you.

778
01:08:29,477 --> 01:08:31,029
Let us pray.

779
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:35,868
Look down in pity
on this, your servant,

780
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:37,369
Martin,

781
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:40,272
Now in the toils
of the unclean spirit,

782
01:08:40,472 --> 01:08:43,376
Now caught up
in the fearsome threats

783
01:08:43,377 --> 01:08:46,153
Of man's ancient enemy,

784
01:08:46,353 --> 01:08:49,132
Sworn foe of our race...

785
01:09:01,312 --> 01:09:03,597
By the sign
of the cross...

786
01:09:07,103 --> 01:09:12,107
Keep watch over the innermost
recesses of his heart.

787
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:32,590
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

788
01:11:32,591 --> 01:11:35,594
Devil. You are the devil.

789
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,571
You devil, you.

790
01:11:54,165 --> 01:11:57,034
It's just a costume.

791
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:16,054
It's only a costume.

792
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:50,309
Wait just a minute.
I'll get some money.

793
01:12:52,812 --> 01:12:54,896
How about a little
painting tomorrow?

794
01:12:55,096 --> 01:12:56,698
Joey's
out of town again,

795
01:12:56,898 --> 01:13:00,402
And he left the game
room half finished.

796
01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:04,858
You want me here
for sex, don't you?

797
01:13:05,058 --> 01:13:07,609
I never really
did it before.

798
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:10,196
I was always
too shy.

799
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:15,201
But I decided...

800
01:13:15,202 --> 01:13:19,372
i'd really like
to do it with you.

801
01:13:31,969 --> 01:13:33,938
I'm all dressed now.

802
01:13:36,558 --> 01:13:38,526
Why are you crying?

803
01:13:40,446 --> 01:13:42,448
Why are you crying?

804
01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:44,148
It's nothing.

805
01:13:47,454 --> 01:13:50,857
Did I hurt you?
What did I do?

806
01:13:51,057 --> 01:13:54,460
You didn't do
anything, Martin.

807
01:13:54,461 --> 01:13:57,464
You're worrying
about having a kid.

808
01:13:57,664 --> 01:13:59,333
I knew I should
have worn

809
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:01,067
One of those things.

810
01:14:01,267 --> 01:14:02,802
Oh, jesus, Martin.

811
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:05,088
It's nothing
to do with you.

812
01:14:05,089 --> 01:14:07,057
Really?

813
01:14:07,058 --> 01:14:10,511
Really. Worrying about
having a kid. Ha ha.

814
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,317
I can't have kids.

815
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:18,320
I can never
have kids.

816
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,022
There's something
wrong inside.

817
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:23,024
I don't know.

818
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,831
What do you think?

819
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:33,368
Is that good for me
or bad for me?

820
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:36,955
No opinion?

821
01:14:36,956 --> 01:14:39,541
That's why you're so nice
to have around, Martin.

822
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:42,128
You don't have opinions.

823
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:44,265
You took it down.

824
01:14:44,465 --> 01:14:45,214
What?

825
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:49,403
You took it down.

826
01:14:49,603 --> 01:14:52,105
Oh, I thought
it was stupid,

827
01:14:52,106 --> 01:14:53,908
A stupid superstition.

828
01:14:54,108 --> 01:14:56,729
I just didn't want it
there, that's all.

829
01:14:56,929 --> 01:15:00,314
I was right,
wasn't i?

830
01:15:00,315 --> 01:15:02,317
Hurry and come down
to supper.

831
01:15:02,517 --> 01:15:04,535
I'm going out
tonight.

832
01:15:04,536 --> 01:15:06,487
Woget the goddamn stogie
out of your mouth

833
01:15:06,488 --> 01:15:08,874
And don't burn me up.

834
01:15:09,074 --> 01:15:11,626
I'll try not to.

835
01:15:11,627 --> 01:15:13,712
Don't try
to burn me up.

836
01:15:17,716 --> 01:15:21,721
Nope. I've just got to get
out of here, that's all.

837
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,522
I say go
to all of you.

838
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:25,725
If you don't want
to be here,

839
01:15:25,925 --> 01:15:27,727
Then we don't
need you!

840
01:15:27,927 --> 01:15:30,313
I want to be here.

841
01:15:30,314 --> 01:15:33,400
I've been here
since I was a kid.

842
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:35,202
Hey, but i'm
a good mechanic.

843
01:15:35,402 --> 01:15:38,522
I should be fixing cars.
What am I doing here?

844
01:15:38,523 --> 01:15:40,608
Go...like
william korinzkas,

845
01:15:40,808 --> 01:15:43,161
Like molinopzkus.

846
01:15:43,162 --> 01:15:45,747
It's good for christina
not to be married yet.

847
01:15:45,947 --> 01:15:47,280
She's young
for her years.

848
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:50,367
Maybe it's good for her
never to marry.

849
01:15:50,368 --> 01:15:53,422
You know,
we have a problem...

850
01:15:53,623 --> 01:15:55,007
in the family.

851
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:55,809
What?

852
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:57,510
You've seen
the boy Martin.

853
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:58,544
Yeah.

854
01:15:58,545 --> 01:16:00,429
Oh, it is a problem.

855
01:16:00,629 --> 01:16:03,432
It is the shame
of us parents.

856
01:16:03,632 --> 01:16:06,135
You want to have
children, don't you?

857
01:16:06,335 --> 01:16:07,637
Yeah.

858
01:16:07,638 --> 01:16:08,972
Think about it.

859
01:16:08,973 --> 01:16:11,058
Just think about it.

860
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,065
You're still here.

861
01:16:19,066 --> 01:16:20,952
I guess...

862
01:16:21,152 --> 01:16:24,154
i guess he, uh...
couldn't come.

863
01:16:25,656 --> 01:16:27,658
I guess, uh...

864
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:32,005
i don't like
arthur.

865
01:16:32,205 --> 01:16:34,332
He makes you
feel bad.

866
01:16:35,585 --> 01:16:37,386
Oh, Martin,
it isn't arthur.

867
01:16:37,586 --> 01:16:41,474
It's...i don't expect
any more from arthur.

868
01:16:41,674 --> 01:16:43,058
It's...

869
01:16:43,059 --> 01:16:44,643
it's everything.

870
01:16:44,644 --> 01:16:45,445
It's...

871
01:16:45,645 --> 01:16:47,013
it's everything.

872
01:16:53,937 --> 01:16:55,438
Arthur told me about

873
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:57,132
The conversation
you had with him.

874
01:16:57,332 --> 01:16:59,025
It's such bullshit,
grandfather.

875
01:16:59,026 --> 01:17:01,285
It is so goddamn
hypocritical.

876
01:17:01,485 --> 01:17:03,748
There is insanity
in this family,

877
01:17:03,948 --> 01:17:05,332
And you've got it!

878
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,702
You will not use such
language in my house.

879
01:17:07,902 --> 01:17:09,453
Language? Shit
on the language!

880
01:17:13,957 --> 01:17:16,543
Well, good-Bye,
grandfather cuda.

881
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:23,936
Where will you go?

882
01:17:25,271 --> 01:17:28,274
I leave tomorrow
morning with arthur.

883
01:17:28,474 --> 01:17:30,076
Oh, but don't worry.

884
01:17:30,276 --> 01:17:32,987
We won't have
any offspring.

885
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:35,898
We won't even
wind up together.

886
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:38,985
Arthur's
just my way out.

887
01:17:41,488 --> 01:17:43,289
Christina...

888
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:45,959
you are wrong.

889
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,746
Well, then,
too bad for me.

890
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,593
Christina: if you
need anything,

891
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:03,395
You just
call me or...

892
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:05,346
Or come. I'll send
you the money.

893
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,649
No. You'll forget
about me.

894
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:08,817
No, I won't.

895
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,519
Why do you think
i'll forget?

896
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,522
Because
you're going away.

897
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,108
People always go away

898
01:18:15,109 --> 01:18:17,493
So they can forget
where they were.

899
01:18:19,245 --> 01:18:21,247
Well, I won't.
You'll see.

900
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,249
I won't forget.

901
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:28,120
I'll tell you
where I am.

902
01:18:55,316 --> 01:18:57,068
Martin...

903
01:18:57,069 --> 01:18:59,871
will you finish
your breakfast?

904
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:14,013
I wish you could
shoot me up with drugs,

905
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:17,473
Take away a piece of my brain
or something.

906
01:19:23,563 --> 01:19:26,734
Boy, do I wish what
you have is catching.

907
01:19:26,735 --> 01:19:29,820
Some people think
it is catching.

908
01:19:31,322 --> 01:19:33,991
In the movies,
it's catching.

909
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:35,860
Give it to me.

910
01:19:35,861 --> 01:19:37,445
Please.

911
01:19:44,703 --> 01:19:46,671
Martin, you're lazy!

912
01:19:46,672 --> 01:19:48,975
You're a lazy boy!

913
01:19:49,175 --> 01:19:50,759
Cuda, you make him work!

914
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,045
We work hard
around here!

915
01:19:53,046 --> 01:19:54,630
Martin's voice:
there's a lot of people

916
01:19:54,631 --> 01:19:55,932
I could do it to
if I wanted.

917
01:19:56,132 --> 01:19:58,634
Man's voice: ooh, stay away
from your old friend barry.

918
01:19:58,635 --> 01:20:01,221
Martin's voice: I know a lot
of people. I know what they do.

919
01:20:01,222 --> 01:20:04,191
I've watched them a lot,
and I know what they do.

920
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:25,464
I've been
letting them go,

921
01:20:25,465 --> 01:20:27,550
Even the ones who are
really mean to me all the time.

922
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,418
I just decided
to let them go.

923
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:34,173
So I don't know
what i'm gonna do.

924
01:20:34,373 --> 01:20:36,367
I'm getting pretty shaky.

925
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,561
I'm really
getting shaky.

926
01:20:38,562 --> 01:20:40,146
Can I bring
your buggy back?

927
01:20:40,147 --> 01:20:41,148
You ain't got
to pay no cash.

928
01:20:41,348 --> 01:20:42,449
I don't want
no money.

929
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:44,650
And when I try to find
somebody to do it to,

930
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:45,869
I can't decide.

931
01:20:46,069 --> 01:20:48,154
It's like...none of the ladies
look pretty.

932
01:20:48,155 --> 01:20:49,456
I don't know.

933
01:20:49,656 --> 01:20:52,460
I used to be able
to decide fast.

934
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:55,579
I used to be able
to find somebody really fast...

935
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:58,583
The ladies looked pretty
or something.

936
01:20:58,783 --> 01:20:59,467
Please.

937
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:01,168
Leave her alone!

938
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:04,923
Man, what
you doing?

939
01:21:04,924 --> 01:21:06,559
Martin's voice:
maybe it's just because

940
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:08,761
I'm doing the sexy stuff
without the blood now,

941
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,764
Doing it
with an awake person.

942
01:21:11,964 --> 01:21:13,132
I don't know.

943
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:22,976
He looks really good
in his tennis shoes, doesn't he?

944
01:21:27,981 --> 01:21:32,201
hey, that's where
that loony lives, man.

945
01:21:32,202 --> 01:21:34,788
Hey, give me
that beer can, will you?

946
01:21:34,988 --> 01:21:37,574
I can hit that loony
with this beer can.

947
01:21:37,575 --> 01:21:39,376
Come on.
Give me a beer can.

948
01:21:39,377 --> 01:21:41,328
Whoo! Hey!

949
01:21:53,926 --> 01:21:57,430
How about a beer?
Give me a beer.

950
01:22:01,935 --> 01:22:03,620
You know, you
didn't have to like

951
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,472
All of that attention
that he was giving you.

952
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:09,150
What can I say?
Beggars can't be choosers.

953
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,827
Yeah? Well, you can
beg and choose me,

954
01:22:11,828 --> 01:22:13,229
Can't you?

955
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:14,830
Sure can.

956
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:17,334
Martin's voice:
i've got to do something.

957
01:22:17,534 --> 01:22:19,137
I've got to pick
somebody.

958
01:22:19,337 --> 01:22:22,039
I'm getting so shaky,
i might make a mistake.

959
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,841
Barry's voice: a mistake?

960
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:27,044
Martin: I might make a mistake
and get caught.

961
01:22:27,244 --> 01:22:29,546
Barry's voice:
hear that, night-Timers?

962
01:22:29,746 --> 01:22:31,350
The count
is getting thirsty.

963
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:34,553
So watch out!
Watch out, night-Timers.

964
01:22:34,753 --> 01:22:37,555
He might be
in your neighborhood.

965
01:22:37,755 --> 01:22:39,357
Ha ha ha!

966
01:22:39,557 --> 01:22:42,059
Barry on radio:
...neighborhood. Ha ha ha!

967
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:45,824
Oh, I found me a place
to sleep here tonight.

968
01:22:46,024 --> 01:22:49,785
Oh, here's a special here...
'64 buick, $75.

969
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:52,287
I only want to sleep
all night long.

970
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,457
Here's a '60 chevy,
as is...

971
01:22:58,379 --> 01:23:00,880
Hey!

972
01:25:51,649 --> 01:25:54,734
Go up
to the west side.

973
01:26:17,293 --> 01:26:18,877
Freeze!

974
01:26:35,027 --> 01:26:37,030
Take the car
in front of the warehouse.

975
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:39,032
I'll follow him on foot.

976
01:26:44,203 --> 01:26:46,006
This is car 14 reporting.
Lozono on foot.

977
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:49,210
I'm going around to the front
of the warehouse.

978
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,850
guys, guys, quiet.

979
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,551
What's that?
What's that noise?

980
01:26:58,552 --> 01:26:59,855
I'll check it out.

981
01:27:00,055 --> 01:27:01,556
What the hell
are you doing here?

982
01:27:01,557 --> 01:27:04,426
What you want in here?
Oh, it's just a little kid.

983
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:07,313
Wait a minute.
It's just a kid.

984
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:10,414
It's just a kid.
Hey, stevie, man, be cool.

985
01:27:10,614 --> 01:27:13,518
What you want in here?
Why don't you leave

986
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:15,021
Get the fuck out!

987
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:33,923
Freeze!

988
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:30,184
good time
of the year to go south.

989
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:32,821
You ever been
to mexico?

990
01:28:33,022 --> 01:28:37,775
I was in mexico...
about 2 years ago.

991
01:28:37,776 --> 01:28:40,246
You don't have
a travel section, do you?

992
01:28:40,446 --> 01:28:41,330
No.

993
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:44,032
Can't depend on
the newspapers anymore.

994
01:28:46,036 --> 01:28:47,837
Barry's voice:
but you don't...

995
01:28:48,037 --> 01:28:49,839
you don't know what
you're gonna do, huh?

996
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:53,042
Martin's voice: no,
i really don't. I really don't.

997
01:28:53,243 --> 01:28:55,545
I never got a letter
from christina.

998
01:28:55,745 --> 01:28:57,047
I knew she'd forget.

999
01:28:57,048 --> 01:28:59,700
Barry's voice:
hmm, that's too bad.

1000
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,552
Martin's voice:
yeah, that is too bad.

1001
01:29:23,993 --> 01:29:26,461
Martin's voice: I guess
i shouldn't have friends.

1002
01:29:26,462 --> 01:29:27,346
Barry's voice: no.

1003
01:29:27,546 --> 01:29:29,331
Martin's voice:
i was getting pretty mixed up.

1004
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:30,915
Barry's voice:
no, that's right.

1005
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:33,920
You shouldn't get involved.
It's...it's dangerous, right?

1006
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,556
Martin's voice:
right. You forget.

1007
01:29:36,557 --> 01:29:38,140
You make mistakes.

1008
01:29:38,141 --> 01:29:39,559
Barry's voice:
live for yourself.

1009
01:29:39,759 --> 01:29:42,094
Whatever it takes to get
through the night, right, count?

1010
01:29:42,095 --> 01:29:43,680
Martin: are you
making fun of me?

1011
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:45,082
Barry's voice:
i'm with you, count.

1012
01:29:45,282 --> 01:29:46,683
I mean,
you're absolutely right.

1013
01:29:46,684 --> 01:29:47,985
You're all right,
my man.

1014
01:29:48,185 --> 01:29:50,187
Martin: well, I don't know
what i'm gonna do.

1015
01:29:50,387 --> 01:29:51,571
I really don't!

1016
01:29:53,324 --> 01:29:54,826
Cathy.

1017
01:30:06,789 --> 01:30:08,540
Woman's voice: Martin...

1018
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:21,688
Martin's voice:
i didn't do it.

1019
01:30:21,888 --> 01:30:23,606
I didn't do it.

1020
01:30:23,607 --> 01:30:25,108
Barry's voice:
mm-Hmm. Ok.

1021
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:27,110
Martin's voice:
i really didn't.

1022
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:28,411
Barry's voice: ok.

1023
01:30:28,611 --> 01:30:31,114
Martin's voice: in a way,
i'm glad it's all over.

1024
01:30:31,115 --> 01:30:33,268
I shouldn't have friends,

1025
01:30:33,468 --> 01:30:35,620
Not even
for the sexy stuff.

1026
01:30:42,377 --> 01:30:44,262
And that's another thing
about those movies.

1027
01:30:44,462 --> 01:30:47,966
Vampires always have ladies,
sometimes lots of ladies.

1028
01:30:47,967 --> 01:30:49,869
Well, that's wrong, too.

1029
01:30:50,069 --> 01:30:51,770
You don't need
all that.

1030
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:54,473
Barry's voice: ha ha ha!
You don't need that?

1031
01:30:54,673 --> 01:30:56,275
Martin: no,
you really don't.

1032
01:30:56,475 --> 01:30:58,277
I mean, if the magic part
was real

1033
01:30:58,477 --> 01:31:00,980
And you could make them do
whatever you wanted to...

1034
01:31:00,981 --> 01:31:02,282
Barry's voice:
oh, yeah.

1035
01:31:02,482 --> 01:31:04,850
Martin: well,
that would be different.

1036
01:31:05,051 --> 01:31:06,936
In real life...
in real life,

1037
01:31:06,937 --> 01:31:10,323
You can't get people to do
what you want them to do.

1038
01:31:56,956 --> 01:31:58,541
You get used to things,
you know.

1039
01:31:58,542 --> 01:32:00,043
Barry's voice:
yeah, sure.

1040
01:32:00,044 --> 01:32:02,046
Martin's voice:
you get used to your life,

1041
01:32:02,246 --> 01:32:04,916
And it all gets easier.

1042
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:09,252
Tada cuda:
i warned you, Martin.

1043
01:32:09,253 --> 01:32:11,555
Nobody in the town,
i said.

1044
01:32:11,755 --> 01:32:13,141
Nobody in the town.

1045
01:32:13,341 --> 01:32:15,427
I heard about
mrs. Santini.

1046
01:32:15,428 --> 01:32:18,621
You think I believe
she killed herself?

1047
01:32:18,821 --> 01:32:22,016
Do you really think
i believe this?

1048
01:32:22,017 --> 01:32:24,819
Your soul is damned,
nosferatu.

1049
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:02,861
Captioning made possible by
lions gate home entertainment

1050
01:33:25,086 --> 01:33:26,737
yeah, that's him.
I liked him.

1051
01:33:26,937 --> 01:33:28,664
I wonder
where the count is.

1052
01:33:28,864 --> 01:33:30,628
I know he's
out there somewhere.

1053
01:33:30,828 --> 01:33:32,393
He hasn't called
in a long time.

1054
01:33:32,593 --> 01:33:34,394
All right, the count.
Yes, the count.

1055
01:33:34,594 --> 01:33:36,596
We all want to know
what happened to the count.

1056
01:33:36,797 --> 01:33:40,101
What do you think
happened to the count?

1057
01:33:40,102 --> 01:33:41,904
what happened
to the count?

1058
01:33:42,104 --> 01:33:43,906
the count.
What happened to the count?

1059
01:33:44,106 --> 01:33:47,608
The question of the year
is what happened to the count?

1060
01:33:47,808 --> 01:33:50,612
I don't know.
What happened to the count?

1061
01:33:50,812 --> 01:33:53,616
All right,
our man the count, yes.

1062
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:01,207
oh, the count.
We have a call for the count.

1063
01:34:01,407 --> 01:34:03,209
I kind of hope
you're listening out there.

1064
01:34:03,409 --> 01:34:05,011
The people
want to hear from you.

1065
01:34:05,211 --> 01:34:07,014
Go ahead. What's your concern
about the count?

1066
01:34:07,214 --> 01:34:09,716
I wondered where he was,
and while I was wondering,

1067
01:34:09,717 --> 01:34:11,367
I wrote a song
about him.

1068
01:34:11,567 --> 01:34:13,020
Black cape and shiny...

1069
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:16,223
Second his cape
is not black, you understand.

1070
01:34:16,423 --> 01:34:17,724
No, he stands cool,

1071
01:34:17,725 --> 01:34:20,729
And his cape
has got patterns on it,

1072
01:34:20,929 --> 01:34:22,462
Like a paisley.

1073
01:34:22,662 --> 01:34:24,198
a paisley?

1074
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:27,702
and he wears
a big apple cap.

1075
01:34:29,704 --> 01:34:34,576
you sound polish.
We have a polish vampire.

1076
01:34:34,577 --> 01:34:36,996
we enjoy your show.
I hope you get him back.

1077
01:34:37,196 --> 01:34:38,297
And it was
a good gimmick.

1078
01:34:38,497 --> 01:34:40,999
Second I think I know
where the count is.

1079
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,502
I have a friend
who I think is the count.
