1
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,300
Ah, look at you, Cleveland!

2
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,700
Put your hands together for this one.

3
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,400
What say?

4
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
From the top!

5
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,300
Yeah!

6
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Thank you.

7
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,200
We love you, Cleveland! Whoo!

8
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,800
- Dudes! Yeah!
- Yeah!

9
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,200
Do you have any idea how
rare that is? That kind of energy...

10
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,700
...coming off the crowd
and feeding us?

11
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,500
And us feeding it right back to them?
That is what it's all about, my brothers.

12
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,000
We are gonna be huge!

13
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,500
- More importantly, how were my moves?
- Those moves.

14
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,500
I got the best seat in the house
between the guitar and bass...

15
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,300
...and you rocked. Yeah!
- Yeah!

16
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,000
- Oh, now, that was classic Vesuvius.
- Billy.

17
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,300
Nice show. Whoo!

18
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,700
- Hey, what did the label say?
- Let's start with some beers first.

19
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,400
Those are on me,
and those are imported.

20
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,400
- Imported. Sounds like good news, right?
Or bad.

21
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,900
Be right back.
- More like awesome news.

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,100
Matchbook Records just offered us
an awesome contract...

23
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,100
...and it is awesome.

24
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,900
- We're gonna be rich!
- I'm gonna get a Fiero.

25
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

26
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,000
There's just one hitch.

27
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,000
They want you to replace Fish.

28
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,500
President of the label
wants his nephew in the band.

29
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,400
Fish is the heart and soul of this band.
We've been together since high school.

30
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,100
- He came up with the name Vesuvius.
- Yeah, he's great.

31
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,500
Guys, they're gonna put money
behind you. That means videos, touring...

32
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,300
No. Forget it, Billy.

33
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
We're not gonna sell him out
because some rich kid...

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,300
...wants to play rock star. Forget it.
- All right.

35
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,100
I'm calling the head of the label now.
Tell him where he can stick his nephew.

36
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, there was talk of you guys
opening for Whitesnake...

37
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,700
...but sometimes opportunity
knocks twice, right?

38
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,700
- Whitesnake, man.
- Dude, I love that band.

39
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,000
I mean, think about it.
Fish will land on his feet, right?

40
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,800
Like I said, he's a great drummer.

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
Right. He's gonna be fine.

42
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,600
Billy, hang up that phone.

43
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,300
You traitors!

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,900
Start the van, man. He's coming!

45
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,700
We lost him.

46
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,200
- I don't think that went too well.
- What a baby.

47
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,200
- We did it, guys. All right.
- We totally did it.

48
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
- That was kind of awesome!
- It's gonna be all right.

49
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
I think we lost him.

50
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,800
That's definitely gonna be in a book
about us.

51
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
He didn't fit.

52
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,600
After all we've been through?
And you sell me out just like that?

53
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,700
Oh, my God.
He was like a jet plane.

54
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,600
- So fast.
- Fast runner.

55
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
- Definitely a fast runner.
- I didn't know how fast he was!

56
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I was going 60.

57
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,100
- He ran like a gazelle, right?
- I was gonna say that.

58
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,700
- Like, his stride was really big.
- Yeah, really big.

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Like he'd lived with animals
or something, in the woods.

60
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,300
And he, like, mimicked their... Aah!

61
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
Jesus, man, keep going!

62
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,700
Oh, my...

63
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,900
We gotta shake him loose, man!

64
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,500
I will drag you down to hell with me.
I will eat your souls.

65
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
Hit the brakes, man!

66
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,500
Oh, my God, Kerr. You killed him.

67
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,100
You killed him.

68
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,300
He deserved it, man.

69
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,900
He's dead.

70
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,900
He can't be killed.

71
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Dude, he can't be killed.
He can't be killed.

72
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,900
Back it up, back it up.

73
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,800
He's a zombie!

74
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,600
I don't need you!

75
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,700
I'm gonna be 10 times bigger
than you! No!

76
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,500
A billion times bigger than you! No!

77
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,900
Eleventy billion, trillion...

78
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,500
... vermillion times bigger than you!

79
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,700
Jeez, this would be a great album
if I could ever listen to it.

80
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
New Vesuvius, fellas.

81
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,500
Waited in line two hours last night
to get it. Supposed to be amazing.

82
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,300
Everybody thought they peaked
when their sixth album went platinum...

83
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,100
...but then they came back...

84
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,900
...and blew the doors off
with Devil's Nursery.

85
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,200
- Devil's Nursery rocks.
Look at those faces.

86
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,800
It's the etchings of time, man.
These guys have really lived, you know?

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,300
Yeah, I know.

88
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,300
Oh, you a fan?
I mean, how could you not be, right?

89
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,200
I don't really listen
to heavy-metal music.

90
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,900
- Oh, dude, you gotta hear this.
- No, I don't.

91
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,800
- No, seriously, if you've never heard...
- Seriously, I'm not interested.

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,800
Trust me. One track,
you're gonna be hooked for life.

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,800
- Zammit's Metal Racking.
- Hello, Zammit's Metal Racking. What?

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
You wanna hear the new Vesuvius?

95
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,100
Yeah. It's sweet, huh?

96
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,300
I'll burn you a copy.

97
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,900
Can you hold, please?

98
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,500
Do not tell me that this was
about them.

99
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,100
Well, as it happens, by coincidence,
it was the new album...

100
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,900
...by Vesuvius.

101
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,200
- Damn it, Rob.
- Which is terrible, by the way.

102
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,700
- Totally overproduced.
- Really? Okay, look. Rob.

103
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,700
I know that we've been through this
a whole bunch...

104
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,100
...and I know you think
you're getting past it...

105
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,800
...but this is not getting past it.
It has been 20 years. Let it go.

106
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,900
I have let it go...

107
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,800
...and the universe keeps shoving
Vesuvius back in my face.

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,500
Look, guppy, I don't think
I can do this anymore.

109
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,300
This just isn't working for me.
I'm sorry. I think it's time...

110
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,200
- I break up with you.
- What?

111
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,100
- I break up with you. l...
- No.

112
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,500
- No!
- Yes.

113
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,300
- What?
- What were you gonna say?

114
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,300
- I interrupted you.
- You just said what I was gonna say.

115
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,100
I am breaking up with you,
so quiet.

116
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,300
I am fantastic.
You don't break up with me.

117
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm gonna have to ask you
to pack your things and leave.

118
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,400
This is my apartment.

119
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,600
This is gonna be great.

120
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,300
A fresh start, you know,
get my life back on track.

121
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,500
That's the attitude, Robert.
- Thanks, sis.

122
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,500
So you'll be on your feet...

123
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,800
...and out of this house
in what, about a week?

124
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,700
- Lisa, come on. Give the guy a break.
- Thank you, Stan.

125
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,100
Talk about your missed opportunity.
Imagine if he was still in Vesuvius.

126
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,400
My brother-in-law in Vesuvius.

127
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
Know what our lives would be like?

128
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,200
I'd be wearing silk underwear
right now.

129
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,900
It's like winning the lottery...

130
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,100
...and having the lottery ticket
ripped up in front of your face.

131
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,400
Thank you, Stan.

132
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,700
Thought we weren't supposed to use
the V-word in front of Uncle Rob.

133
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,200
He can take it.

134
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,000
So have you heard? Matt got into MIT.

135
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,600
- Oh.
That's my boy.

136
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,900
That makes sense. Last time I saw you,
you were building a robot.

137
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,800
How'd that ever work out?

138
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,100
That was eight years ago,
when I was 10.

139
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Ha!

140
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Maybe you want to take a can
of shut up.

141
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,900
Matt is also in a band,
playing the prom.

142
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,900
- The only way he'd ever get to go.
Hey.

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,400
I swear if you don't stop annoying me,
I'm gonna shave your head in your sleep.

144
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,100
I'd still be the pretty child.

145
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,400
Matt.
- Violet, Matt, stop it.

146
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
A band, huh?
So, what do you call yourselves?

147
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
A.D.D.

148
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Add? Huh.

149
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,900
- Well, it's short.
- What?

150
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Easy to remember.

151
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,300
No. It's A.D.D.,
as in attention deficit disorder.

152
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,600
Oh, good, you changed it,
because "Add" really blew.

153
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,300
Robby, you know I love you...

154
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,300
...but letting you stay here
isn't gonna solve your problems.

155
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
Of course.
Just ditch me, like everyone else has.

156
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,700
It's called tough love, kid.

157
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,900
But what about the sweet love,
where you say, " Hey...

158
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,100
...stay as long as you want, and here's
some cash so you can fix your car."

159
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,100
- In your dreams, pal.
- Sis, come on.

160
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,700
I'm feeling really good about
the future, you know?

161
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,200
Like all of this is... Ah!

162
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Robert?

163
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,900
Where is Jeremy? I swear,
I am gonna kill him when he shows up.

164
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,100
Here he comes, with his mom.

165
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,000
Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy's Mom.

166
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Hey, guys. So I kind of got suspended
from school today...

167
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,700
...and I can't play prom.

168
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,300
- Wait. What?
- Tell them what you did, Jeremy.

169
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
I kind of brought hash brownies
to the Spanish Club luncheon.

170
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,700
- Not bueno.
And?

171
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,600
And Señorita Horowitz
kind of got really stoned...

172
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
...and passed out
in the locker room.

173
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
And?

174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,200
And somebody kind of drew a, uh...

175
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
A penis.

176
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
A penis on a grown woman's face.

177
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
And now he can't walk
during graduation.

178
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,100
Every mother's dream.
Let's go, Jeremy.

179
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,300
See you guys. Rock hard.

180
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
A penis.

181
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,100
- Prom is in two days.
- Not for us, it's not.

182
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,500
You know what?

183
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Blessing in disguise.

184
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,700
Who wants to play
some crappy school dance anyway?

185
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,200
I do. And so do you.

186
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,300
- Whatever.
- I could ask my uncle.

187
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,000
- I don't think we're that desperate.
- He was an original member of Vesuvius.

188
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,500
- I bet he can still play.
- Yeah, but he's ancient.

189
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's start looking for a new drummer.

190
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Yeah, so am I in?

191
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,100
- Hey, wh...
- Sorry, Uncle Rob. Were we too loud?

192
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,200
"Too loud" is not in my vocabulary.
How dare you?

193
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,900
- Excuse me?
- How dare you call yourself a musician?

194
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Loads of bands use drum loops.

195
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,300
Loads of elevators play Celine Dion.
That don't make it right.

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Now get your devil box out of here.

197
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,600
Move it, Moby Dick.

198
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,500
Go.

199
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,300
My work here is done.

200
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,900
- That's your uncle.
- That's my uncle.

201
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,300
We've kind of exhausted
all our other options, so...

202
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,800
- I don't have any better ideas.
- Okay, fine. Go talk to him.

203
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,800
Hey, Uncle Rob, can I talk to you?

204
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,300
I will not buy beer for you
and your friends...

205
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,300
...nor rent you my password
to porn sites.

206
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,300
Rent...? No, no. I was...

207
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,700
I was actually just wondering
if you'd play with us at our prom gig.

208
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,200
What did you just say?

209
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,500
I was wondering if you'd play the drums
with us, just for one night.

210
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,800
Absolutely not.

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,900
I haven't played the drums in 20 years.
Drumming is pain...

212
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,200
...and I've had more than enough pain
for one lifetime.

213
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,100
Look.

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Come... Just meet me up here.

215
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
We need a drummer, okay?
And you play the drums.

216
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,100
You've been a pretty terrible uncle
over the years.

217
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,700
Yeah, you only come by when you
need something from my mom.

218
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,000
You never remember my birthday.
You called me Max until I was 11.

219
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
Okay, what's your point, Matt?

220
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,100
This is...

221
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,700
This is really, really important to me.

222
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,500
I'm not what you would call
a social butterfly.

223
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,300
You know?

224
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,500
Playing this gig...

225
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
...is probably the closest I'm ever
gonna get to...

226
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,100
...breaking the ice with, you know,
the ladies.

227
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,700
You're looking to score.
I can respect that.

228
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,000
Anyway, if you really are my uncle...

229
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,900
...my family...

230
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,100
...you will do this one thing for me.

231
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,100
- Matt, where is he?
- He said he would be here.

232
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,700
He doesn't know the songs,
and I thought he'd be here early.

233
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,700
He said he didn't need to,
he could play with us in his sleep.

234
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,600
He said he feeds on God juice
and miracles spring forth.

235
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Never fear, niños. Got our laminates.
All access. Drives the chicks wild.

236
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Hey, are you ready?
We're on in five minutes.

237
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Five minutes? What? We're headlining.
We shouldn't go on till 11.

238
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,400
It's the prom. It's over at 11.

239
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,300
Wait. So we're on in five minutes?
Seriously, five minutes?

240
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,300
Okay.

241
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,100
Wow. That's... Five minutes.
Eye of the tiger.

242
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Bang a gong, get it on. Bang a gong.

243
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
Get it on, all night long, bang a gong,
get it on. Rock me, Amadeus.

244
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh!

245
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,500
- I'm gonna be so sick.
- A little pre-show ritual.

246
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,700
- Did you just...?
- Lucky charm.

247
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,600
Some people carry a rabbit's foot,
I rock a pocket of puke.

248
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
Now, ladies and gentlemen, A.D.D.

249
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,900
Follow my lead.

250
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,100
One, two, three.

251
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
A.D. D, ladies and gentlemen. A.D.D.

252
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Now it's time for your prom king
and queen's first dance.

253
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
Stop. Stop.

254
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,300
Woo-hoo! Rock and roll.
Thank you, Cleveland!

255
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,100
Yeah! What a show! Come on.
Mattie, chest bump.

256
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,300
Here we go.
How awesomely sweet was that?

257
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,900
Oh, yeah, if by awesomely sweet,
you mean a horrific train wreck...

258
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,700
...we will never live down, then, yeah,
it was super awesomely sweet.

259
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,900
It was like that scene in Titanic.
You know, the one where they all die.

260
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,500
What? We rocked
the balls off that place!

261
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
- You are delusional.
- You got that right, sourpuss.

262
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,600
You know what else? A.D.D. just landed
itself a new bricklaying drummer...

263
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,200
...and his name is Fish.

264
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,300
Dude. Wake up.

265
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,700
You just ruined that show and you're
never playing with this band again.

266
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,500
Thanks.

267
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,500
Hello.
Hello.

268
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,900
Is Curtis at home?
- Who is asking?

269
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,000
Robert. Fishman.

270
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,800
- My friends call me Fish.
- Fish.

271
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm the drummer in the band
from the...

272
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,900
From the prom.

273
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
Oh.

274
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,300
Oh, you're serious. Oh, wow.
Okay, I'm sorry.

275
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,200
Curtis said that the drummer was older.
I just... I figured college.

276
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,700
- So and you're his older sister?
- That's very flattering. No, I'm his mom.

277
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,900
No, you're not. Seriously, you're not.

278
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,300
What is your name?

279
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,000
Well, usually, Curtis's little friends
call me Ms. Powell.

280
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,100
- Ms. Powell?
- Mm-hm.

281
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,100
There's the cutest little jazz club...

282
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,400
You know, I'm sorry.
I just don't date my son's friends.

283
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,900
You know? It's just icky.

284
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,900
- Right. Yeah.
- Kids are in the back.

285
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,900
Uh, Curtis? Honey?
Your play date's here.

286
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,200
So sweetie, what time is your mom
picking you up?

287
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,700
You're hysterical.

288
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,400
You have no idea. I'll see you guys.

289
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,500
If it isn't the one-man band.

290
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Okay.

291
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,700
Look.

292
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,700
I haven't played in front
of an audience in 20 years...

293
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,700
...and so maybe, possibly...

294
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,000
...I got a little carried away
and out of control, and I'm sorry.

295
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,100
But I can make it up to you.
What if I told you...

296
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,500
...I could get us a gig?
- I'd say you're full of shit.

297
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,600
Oh, whoa. Curtis, 1991 called.
They want their teenage angst back.

298
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,500
Oh, my God, they just called again.
They want that joke back.

299
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,200
Hang on. A gig?
Like when U2 plays and everybody's like:

300
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,000
"Yeah, U2! I love you."

301
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,800
Yes. These songs need
to be heard, man. Seriously!

302
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,500
Who writes these songs, anyway?

303
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,600
- I do.
- Abandonment issues.

304
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,900
Daddy bailed when he was 4, so...

305
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,300
Well, there's a crazy mojo working
with Mr. Dark and Broody there...

306
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,300
...and me likey.

307
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
So what do you say
we lay down tracks...

308
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,400
...with Uncle Fish at the kit,
and let me run with it?

309
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,300
- All right, band meeting.
- Okay. Huddle up.

310
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,700
No, just us three. The band.

311
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,300
Yeah. I'll be in my office.

312
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,300
Okay, perhaps last night
he was a bit ostentatious...

313
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,900
...with his performance style, but you
can't deny the fact that he's got chops.

314
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,900
- No way, man. I told him he's out.
You can't deny it.

315
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,300
All right, you guys.
Let's just think about it like this.

316
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,500
It might be kind of cool...

317
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,100
...you know, if he were in the band.
We'd have it all:

318
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,800
The magnetic
but tormented lead singer...

319
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,400
...the awkward, neurotic, super-nerd...
- That's me. That's me.

320
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,500
...the kind of ironic, postmodern
you know, punk girl...

321
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,300
...and the ancient
crazy-faces-making rocker.

322
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,700
You can't tell me
you've seen anything like that.

323
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,600
- For good reason. This isn't a joke to me.
- You think it is to us?

324
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,000
What have we got to lose?

325
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,600
All right. If he delivers a gig,
I'll give him a chance.

326
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,400
Woo-hoo! Yes.

327
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,200
Hello, Concrete Jungle?

328
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Galardy's Bar & Grill.

329
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,300
Oh, hi. Is this the Hi-Fi Club?
I played there in 1985 with Vesuvius.

330
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,900
I am with the band A.D.D.
I have a demo.

331
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,900
I have a new band.
It's called A... Hello?

332
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,600
We have not yet rocked Akron.

333
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,600
Yes, do you have auditions?
Thank you.

334
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,300
Thank you. You're closed?

335
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,700
Okay. I'll try back.

336
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,700
Oh, what are you doing here?

337
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,100
I'm working on a song.

338
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,400
Oh, uh-oh. Look out, everybody.
Genius at work.

339
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,500
Lennon and McCartney
rolled into one.

340
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,100
- I'd like to get back to work.
- How many songs in that book?

341
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,600
Probably 211.

342
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Wow.

343
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,500
That's like 500 albums.

344
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,300
I was never so much of a songwriter.
More of a name-the-band kind of guy.

345
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,300
Different skill set. Still important.
Can I look at what you are writing?

346
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,100
Dude, we are a band, okay?
Bands share everything.

347
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,500
- Deodorant. Buses. Chicks.
- I'd just rather not.

348
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,700
- We're like a family.
- No.

349
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
I'll be gentle.

350
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,700
Okay.

351
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,700
- These are some great lyrics.
- Thank you.

352
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,700
"Tomorrow never comes."

353
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,200
So true. I don't understand it,
but that's heavy, man.

354
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,000
- Thanks.
- That's good stuff.

355
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,300
Thank you.

356
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
So your dad took off
when you were just a little kid?

357
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,200
Mm. That must have been tough.

358
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,600
You miss what you never knew.

359
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,400
- What are you doing?
- That's good.

360
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,800
- "You miss what you never knew."
- It is? You like it?

361
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,900
- Yeah.
- And you can have it, gratis.

362
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

363
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,900
Are you gonna finish that?

364
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,900
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

365
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,900
- So any luck getting us a gig?
- Yeah.

366
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,500
It's just about finding
the right showcase.

367
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,900
It's just focusing
on the perfect showcase.

368
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,900
No one likes the demo.

369
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,800
I mean, it's stupid to think anybody
but me would be into it.

370
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,500
What? This music is great,
and I can prove it.

371
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
- How?
- Let's ride.

372
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,900
This, my friend,
is called the drive test.

373
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,600
If we can drive around
with no place to go...

374
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,200
...blast the music, and feel like we're
on top of the world...

375
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,900
...then we know
we're onto something.

376
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Sing it.

377
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,700
Like you mean it!

378
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Come on.

379
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Right?

380
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,800
How do you come up with
those rhymes? "Busted, trusted."

381
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,900
I don't know how you come up with it.
I like this part.

382
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,500
Isn't it something, Cleveland?
A.D. D!

383
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,900
- This guy!
- And this guy!

384
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,500
- Mosh pit!
- Mosh?

385
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,300
Slam dance!

386
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,200
It does make you feel invincible, huh?
Like everything is possible now!

387
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,500
And you know what?

388
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,000
If we can bring that to an audience,
even for four and a half minutes...

389
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,700
...then we've got something.

390
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,500
Give me your phone.

391
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,700
Make it turn into a camera.

392
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,300
- That? Okay.
- Yeah.

393
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,900
Give me a rebel yell on three.
Three, two, one!

394
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,100
That is the moment we knew
we were gonna be huge.

395
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,000
Whoo!

396
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
Hello?

397
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,700
Yeah, hold on a sec. Robert!

398
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,500
Ow!
- Robert!

399
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
I'm busy.

400
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,300
- Phone!
Jeez.

401
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,100
Now.

402
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,700
I think it's about a job.

403
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,200
How could it not be about a job?

404
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,600
One of those ones I've been
looking so hard for.

405
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,300
Hello, this is Fish. What?

406
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,900
What? Yeah! No, hold on.
Hold on.

407
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,900
Yeah.

408
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,200
- Gone... That's what I did.
- Yeah, but you sing the harmony.

409
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,500
Oh, jeez.

410
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,700
That needs to be fixed.

411
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,500
God.
I have news...

412
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,900
...but you know what?
Before I reveal said news...

413
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,900
...we need to work on some things,
including stage presence.

414
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,500
Why? Because A.D.D. has a gig.

415
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,700
- What?
- A gig?

416
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,200
A gig! Yes!

417
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
- Whoo!
- Yes!

418
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,900
We are playing the Tiger Room
in Fort Wayne, Indiana...

419
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,200
...Saturday night. We are hitting
the "muh-huh-fuh-ing" road.

420
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,100
Oh, Indiana.

421
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,100
My mom's not gonna let me
go to Indiana.

422
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,400
- No, my mom's not gonna let me go.
Listen up, kiddies.

423
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,800
You don't ask your parents
for permission to rock.

424
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,400
You think The Beatles went to
their mums and dads:

425
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,500
"Hello, Mum. Hello, Dad.

426
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
May I have permission to go
with my mates...

427
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,300
...to a little pub
called Shea Stadium...

428
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,300
...and rock the world
for the rest of eternity?" No!

429
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,300
They were adults! You're an ad...
They were adults.

430
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,000
- What about the church-retreat excuse?
- What's that?

431
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,100
It's like, " Mom, Dad, I really wanna go
on this church retreat...

432
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,100
...that I heard about so that I can learn
about the Bible...

433
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,500
...you know, and meet other teenagers
who share my interest in the Bible."

434
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,900
- Ha. This works?
Yeah.

435
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,200
You just print up a fake flyer
on Photoshop...

436
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,600
...show it to your parents,
and you're at a show.

437
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,700
Give it up
right now, daughter of Beelzebub.

438
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,300
Hit me.

439
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,200
Nothing. Nothing.
You're a tough cookie...

440
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,500
...but I'm gonna get a smile
out of you yet.

441
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,400
Smiling is for the weak.

442
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,700
I can't believe
we're stealing my mom's car.

443
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,500
It's not stealing when you're family.

444
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,900
But still, don't tell your mom.

445
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,600
Hop in.

446
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,900
I'm so nervous.

447
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,100
- Did you just sneeze on my face?
- No, that wasn't me.

448
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
What you working on?

449
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,600
You going to ask to hear something
every time you see me writing?

450
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,500
Pretty much, yep.

451
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,400
- It's called "Bitter."
- Butter?

452
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,200
"Bitter."

453
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,500
It's a song?

454
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
- Yeah, it's a song.
- Let's hear some.

455
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
It goes:

456
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,200
And it goes on like that.

457
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,700
Well, the cyanide and razor blades
are in the glove box. Help yourself.

458
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,600
- Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey.
- What?

459
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,100
It's really good stuff. It's like poetry.

460
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,700
I just wanna say, I am so excited
we're on the road.

461
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,300
We are doing it.
We're living our dream.

462
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,000
This is it. This is what it's about,
living our dream.

463
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,600
You know, we don't stop.
We don't stop for anything. We just...

464
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'd better stop.

465
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,100
Come on, Robert. Let's go.

466
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,100
I can't believe you called
the cops on me.

467
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,900
- You stole my car, Robert.
- I topped off your fluids.

468
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Oh, get a job!

469
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,700
I had a job, an awesome gig
that was gonna pay $ 100...

470
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,000
...until you reported your car missing.
- Oh, take responsibility!

471
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
You!

472
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,100
- So long, Mattie.
- So long...

473
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Don't talk!
You are not allowed to speak!

474
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,900
You are not allowed to drive...

475
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,600
In fact, to do anything
for the rest of the summer.

476
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,700
You can take away the wheels
and his right to free speech...

477
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,600
...but you cannot take away
the dream.

478
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,900
Damn right.

479
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,700
Shut up, Stan.
Get out of my house, Robert.

480
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,100
Hey, Fish, Fish, Fish. Listen.

481
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,600
I'm really sorry she made me drop
a dime on you.

482
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,600
It's okay, buddy.

483
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,400
Hey, give me the heavy-metal
devil horns.

484
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,600
Now lock them with me.

485
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
My brother.

486
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,000
Oh, man, thanks for letting me
stay here, Mr. Lee.

487
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,400
I really appreciate it.
Yeah, those rice bags look comfortable.

488
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,600
Fish, no one has eaten
more takeout than you.

489
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
You put my kids through college.

490
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
You stay until you get
back on your feet, huh?

491
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,700
Thanks, Mr. Lee.

492
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,400
Wow. That heat is tremendous.

493
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Take this.

494
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,500
- What's this for?
- For the rats.

495
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Rats?

496
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,000
Uncle Rob?

497
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,500
Hey. Hey, I thought
you were grounded.

498
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,400
Technically, I'm at the library
for the next 10 minutes.

499
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,000
But I'm not, really. I'm here.

500
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,700
Phew.

501
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,200
It's uncomfortably hot down here.

502
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,100
So, what brings you
to the House of Lee?

503
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
I have a way...

504
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,100
...we can still practice.

505
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,200
So I've taken four webcams...

506
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,300
... then interfaced our computers
to create a non-delayed...

507
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,400
... real-time virtual network.

508
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Hello? Is this thing on?

509
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
- Can you hear us?
- Is this working?

510
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,500
Testing, testing.

511
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,500
Mike check. Check. Can you hear me?

512
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
This thing on?

513
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,000
- It's a camera, it's not a mike.
- I can hear you.

514
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,900
- We can hear you.
- Okay, let's do this.

515
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,300
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.

516
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
- Oh!
It's not a mike, Uncle Rob.

517
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,300
What?
- Is anybody else seeing this?

518
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,600
Okay. All right.

519
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,300
Am I the only one seeing this?
Why is no one else reacting?

520
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,300
- Try "Tomorrow Never Comes."
- Curtis, are you watching this?

521
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,900
- Okay, "Tomorrow Never Comes."
- This is sick. Fish.

522
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,700
- Oh, God. Okay.
Okay, here we go.

523
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,300
One, two, one, two, three, four...

524
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,400
No. Yeah. I know, I keep trying to
download the homework...

525
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,600
...but my annoying brother
is hogging all the bandwidth.

526
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,300
Some stupid practice in our garage.

527
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,400
Hang on. I'll call you back.

528
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,800
Hello, YouTube.

529
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,100
Oh, dude, this is that thing
they were talking about on Stern.

530
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,500
Holy shit. I think that's Robert.

531
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,900
What next, guys?
Oh, that's a lot of Robert.

532
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,200
What do you wanna do next?

533
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,500
Leon, come here, come here.

534
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,300
That's... This guy's hilarious.

535
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,700
That's my brother-in-law.

536
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
- The song's pretty g...
- Taking a little noodle break.

537
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,600
Just had dinner with him.
Get out of here.

538
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,100
Ahem. You want to share this
with the rest of the class, huh?

539
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,600
Oh. What is that?

540
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,500
What's next? Let's keep going.

541
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,100
- Let's keep up this energy.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

542
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,700
Oh, God. Okay.

543
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,100
I'm telling you,
that's the naked drummer.

544
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,700
Are you sure, man? It's kind of
hard to tell with his clothes on.

545
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,900
It is the naked drummer.

546
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,100
Hey, fam.
I got here as fast as I could.

547
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,900
There he is. I don't recognize you
with clothes on.

548
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,500
David Marshall, head of A and R
for Matchbook Records.

549
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,600
Matchbook Records?

550
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,500
By the way, I'm Stan.
I'm kind of with the band.

551
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,800
Great, great.

552
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,900
He's come all the way from Los Angeles
to meet you, Robert.

553
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
We're on the Internet. On the Internet.

554
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,100
Over a million hits and counting.

555
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,800
- You know what that sound is? Anybody?
- No.

556
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,800
What about you, Norm from Cheers?

557
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,900
That's the sound of the money truck
backing up to your door.

558
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,800
But my team at Matchbook,
we see more than money.

559
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,100
We see beyond the gimmick
of the naked drummer.

560
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,000
It's a fun video.
We're laughing at it, laughing...

561
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,600
...but then we're humming the songs.
It's the rope-a-dope.

562
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Know what I mean? The rope-a-dope.
We're laughing, laughing, then boom!

563
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,600
Out of nowhere, we're singing
and humming the tunes. Why?

564
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,300
Why would we do that? I'll tell you why.
Because the songs kick F-ing ass.

565
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,700
Wow! All these years,
wearing a suit to the office.

566
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,300
- I should have been a naked drummer!
- Absolutely. Here's the dealio.

567
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,500
If A.D.D. has more tunes like that,
then Matchbook is very interested.

568
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,900
I'm sure you guys got a lot of heat.
Lot of people coming after you.

569
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,800
Yeah, I didn't pay taxes in the '90s.

570
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,300
The phone's been ringing
off the hook with offers.

571
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,100
Good. Good to know. Okay.
We're in the pressure cooker.

572
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,200
We are through
the looking glass, amigos.

573
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,400
I'm gonna call my people, I'm gonna
come back and holler at you.

574
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,500
Excuse me a sec.

575
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,300
We're gonna be signed.
We're gonna be signed.

576
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,300
- Well...
- I'm gonna go call Amelia and Curtis.

577
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,900
I love your new tat.
I just got it done.

578
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,800
I'll validate you on your way out.

579
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,200
All right, thanks.

580
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,200
Hello. I'm here for A.D.D.

581
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,500
Name?

582
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,300
Robert Fishman.

583
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Studio 3.

584
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,300
Wait. My name is on the list?

585
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,300
- Yeah.
- So my name is on that list.

586
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,200
Yeah.

587
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,500
Can I have it?

588
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,200
- No.
- Okay. Sure.

589
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,400
This does not suck.
You're the man.

590
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,100
They have free food.

591
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,100
Whoa.

592
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,000
The mixing board...

593
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,900
...with its thousands
of mysterious buttons.

594
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,500
The big chair...

595
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,800
...that swooshes me
around the studio.

596
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,700
That allows me to slide
wherever I care to go.

597
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,800
The soundproof glass window.
The giant headphones.

598
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,000
It's not very good.
It's very, very depressing.

599
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,100
It makes me wanna kill myself.

600
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,900
Seriously, we need to stop this
right now.

601
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
Why don't we turn this frown
upside down?

602
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,700
Let's just push the tempo.
Say, "I'm not bitter."

603
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,900
- Okay.
- Okay? Follow my lead.

604
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,700
- What's he doing?
From the bridge. Let's do it.

605
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,900
One, two, three, four!

606
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,500
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

607
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,100
Sing!

608
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,300
- You recording?
- Yep.

609
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,500
- Yeah!
- Ow!

610
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,300
- Yes. That's what I'm talking about!
That rocks.

611
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,500
Instead of a canoe paddling in a pond,
we were a tank flying down a mountain.

612
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,500
- I like that. It feels really good.
- What do you guys think?

613
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,800
Lennon's rolling over in his grave
to hide the boner you just gave him.

614
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,300
We're gonna bounce that down.

615
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,600
- Yeah! Bouncing it down!
- Whoo! What does that mean?

616
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,900
I have no idea. Let's take five.

617
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Someday one of these bad boys
will have your name on it, C-note.

618
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,500
I guarantee.

619
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,500
There's a lot of biz buzz on you
back in Hollyweird, my man.

620
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

621
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,700
You got an opportunity to capitalize
on this YouTube thing.

622
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,700
We're talking an album, a tour...

623
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,300
You're gonna have more ladies
than Jay-Z got Mercedes.

624
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,500
You're gonna need two dicks.

625
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,500
- Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah. No problem.

626
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,700
- What are you guys doing?
- Just telling Big C here the game plan.

627
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,100
We're gonna hang out in the studio
a couple weeks, do more recording...

628
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,900
...then strap in, young'uns.

629
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,600
We're hitting the road.

630
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,700
- What?
- You heard me, Curly Sue.

631
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,100
Midwest tour.

632
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,200
Huh? That's right!

633
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,700
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

634
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,300
All right. Easy.
- Yeah.

635
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,700
And in conclusion,
ladies and gentlemen...

636
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,300
...I promise you that on the road,
these kids will have an experience...

637
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,500
...unlike any they have
ever experienced!

638
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,000
Um...

639
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,600
I think, well,
what he's trying to say in a...

640
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,700
Just a really incomprehensible way...

641
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,500
...is that this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for them.

642
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,300
And they have worked so hard,
and want this so badly.

643
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,000
And I'm not thrilled with letting Curtis go
without me being there...

644
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,800
...but I don't want him to spend the rest
of his life thinking, "What if...?"

645
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,500
You know? So you got my vote.

646
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm sorry.

647
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,200
I lived my life saying, "What if...?"

648
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,600
Twenty years of "What if...?"

649
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,400
You feel me, Jack?

650
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,400
You'll be safe, right?

651
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,300
Of course.

652
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

653
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,900
- Okay?
- Okay.

654
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,400
- Okay.
- Lisa?

655
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,500
Okay. All right.

656
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,600
Just please be careful.
Okay.

657
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,600
Hey. Thank you.

658
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,100
You're welcome.

659
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,900
But if one hair on his head is harmed,
I will kill you.

660
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,100
- Cool.
- All right.

661
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,900
- Mattie? I trust you.
Yeah?

662
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,000
But I don't trust your uncle.

663
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,500
So I don't want you to listen
to a word he says, okay?

664
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

665
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,200
Whoa.

666
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,800
First tour bus.

667
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,100
Nice ride.

668
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,000
I'll call you guys.
- Please do.

669
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,600
- Will you be okay?
- Yes. I'm gonna be fine.

670
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,400
- I love you. I'm so proud of you.
- Love you too.

671
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,300
Mr. Gator here.
All you bear bait headed north...

672
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,700
...on big slab l-5 round yardstick 40...
- Citizens band, huh?

673
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
Pretty cool.

674
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,200
- Ever heard of cell phones?
- Ever heard of brain cancer?

675
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,400
There's two things in this world
I do not trust when they're wireless...

676
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,100
...and that is phones and marionettes.

677
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,000
Woo-hoo! Beaded curtains.

678
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,000
Fridge with beer. Beer I didn't pay for.

679
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,200
Yes. Time to party hearty. Hello.

680
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,700
I thought you were
gonna be the responsible adult.

681
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,800
Oh, I'm gonna be
responsible, all right...

682
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,700
...for partying till my nuts catch fire.

683
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,100
What is wrong with you?

684
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,400
What is wrong with me? All my life,
people kept saying, " Grow up.

685
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,000
Give up your dreams. Get a haircut, Fish.
You'll never rock anymore."

686
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,700
Well, you know what?
Look at me now, day job!

687
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,900
Woo-hoo!

688
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
On your left,
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

689
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,300
Whoo!

690
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,100
Save some room
for my drums, baby...

691
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,100
...because Fish's Age of Rage
has begu...

692
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,500
I got a bug.

693
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,500
- Woo-hoo! First venue.
All right.

694
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,100
First marquee.

695
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,500
Check, check, check. Check, one, two.
Check, one, two. Check. Check.

696
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,200
- First sound check.
- Yeah.

697
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,100
Check, check. Test hit.

698
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,300
Testes, one, two, testes,
check, check.

699
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,400
Let's give a warm
Dayton welcome to A.D.

700
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,300
Yeah.

701
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,100
Hi.

702
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,600
Hello.

703
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,500
Hey, hey. Let's rock.

704
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
One, two, three.

705
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,500
First technical difficulty.

706
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,900
First recovery.

707
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,500
You nailed that key change
on "Too Far."

708
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,200
Oh, thanks.

709
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,600
You were out of your mind.
Chewing the keys off the board.

710
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,800
You were better than Kurt Cobain.
You're like Hurt Cobain.

711
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,100
A.D.D.

712
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,900
You guys are sweet.

713
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,200
First fan. Ha-ha!

714
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,600
That did sound pretty good.

715
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,300
It was better than good.
It was sweet.

716
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,400
You're so wet.

717
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:16,300
- Yes. Yes! Our band is sweet.
- No!

718
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,000
- Sweet!
- Oh, my God.

719
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,400
I'm not leaving you out, Mattie.
I'm saving the biggest hug for you...

720
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,900
...because you brought me here.
- Uncle Rob, we don't need...

721
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,300
- Oh, there we go. Shh.
- Oh, God.

722
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,100
- Uncle Fish has got you there, big fella.
So moist.

723
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,300
Hi.

724
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,200
Um, we were wondering if we could
buy you guys a beer or something.

725
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,300
First groupies.

726
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,800
Unfortunately, they are not of age.
Fortunately...

727
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,600
...I am double the legal limit
for after-show parties.

728
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah, we were kind of looking
for someone...

729
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:58,700
...a little closer to our age,
but thanks.

730
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,900
First blow-off. Let the games begin.

731
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,400
Oh, man.
This is where rock 'n' roll came to die.

732
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,900
It's all about text chats
and Playbox with you guys.

733
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
- It's Xbox.
- Whatever.

734
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,900
We're on tour.

735
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,400
- You may never get this chance again.
- Come on.

736
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Okay? We have gotta cut loose.

737
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
I feel like I cut loose
when I'm on-stage.

738
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,800
Then I like to rest and unwind a little bit.
Please move.

739
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,600
- And you call yourself my nephew.
- He's right.

740
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,700
- It's late. We're tired.
- You're like a bunch of grandmas.

741
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,600
You look like Miss Saigon.

742
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,600
Wait, I get it. You guys don't know
what it means to go on tour.

743
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,000
- Don't you do this.
- Well, I do.

744
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,400
You're a monster.

745
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,300
Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish!

746
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,800
I am a golden Fish!

747
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,900
Woo-hoo!

748
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Woo-hoo!

749
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,000
Yeah! Now we got a party!

750
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,900
- Aah!
Oh!

751
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,000
Hey, man. What's wrong?

752
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,300
We're in the joint.

753
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,300
We're going behind bars, man!
This is awesome.

754
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
This is what being a rock star's
all about!

755
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,900
Yeah, I don't know. I guess for me,
it's always been more about the music.

756
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,200
No, music definitely
plays an important part.

757
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,700
I just...

758
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,900
I always hope maybe, you know...

759
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,600
...someday, my dad
would hear one of my songs...

760
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,700
...and feel, I don't know, something.

761
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,100
You want my advice?

762
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,600
You got a good thing going.

763
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,100
Don't chase something
you're never gonna get.

764
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,400
It's his loss. He's the one missing out.

765
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Trust me. I know.

766
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,100
I got the best seat in the house.

767
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,100
Right between the guitar
and the bass.

768
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,700
- Fishman. You all made bail.
- Yes.

769
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,900
- How?
- Thank you. The fans.

770
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,600
The magic of rock 'n' roll.
Come on, where's my posse?

771
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,700
That, my friends, is what happens
when you're a rock star.

772
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,300
- Night, guys.
Night, Fish.

773
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,100
Oh, crap.

774
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,700
Mom?

775
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,000
I trusted you. I vouched for you
and for the safety of these kids.

776
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,100
This is how you pay me back? By being
a drunken, irresponsible, drunken...

777
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,600
- You said "drunken."
- I know.

778
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,100
- What is wrong with you? Hey, Kim.
- Hey, Lisa.

779
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,100
Two arrests in three weeks?

780
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,400
What does it feel like
to destroy a hotel room?

781
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,600
It must be freeing.
It's gotta be freeing, huh?

782
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,500
You have no idea.

783
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,000
- Really?
Oh, yeah.

784
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,800
You are such an idiot.

785
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,900
Come on, Matt. We're going.
Tour's over.

786
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,200
You can't cancel the t...
Lower my voice.

787
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,700
You can't cancel the tour.

788
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,400
- He's right. People are digging...
- I don't care if you're selling out arenas.

789
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,300
- I don't trust Drummer Boy...
- What?

790
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,100
- Let's go.
- I'm not going home.

791
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,100
I'm not, either. And don't call my uncle
Little Drummer Boy.

792
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,900
- He's a big drummer boy.
- I'm the mother, you're the child.

793
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,700
No, because I show you respect,
and then you don't listen.

794
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,800
- I can't hear you.
- Hey. Guys. Guys.

795
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,500
- You don't listen to me.
- We're a band and we stick together.

796
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,900
We're finishing the tour.

797
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,900
I'm sorry if you guys have a problem,
but that's the way it is.

798
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,100
Yeah.

799
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:17,400
- Okay, I'll go.
What?

800
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,300
I don't think it's fair.
These kids cancel their tour...

801
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,900
...because Baby Huey over here
isn't responsible enough to be an adult...

802
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,300
...so I will go.

803
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,700
- I'll go too.
- Oh, be quiet, Stan.

804
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,000
No. A tour with parents is not a tour.
On this point, I will not bend. That's it.

805
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,800
My line in the sand has been drawn.

806
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,800
I just wanna say
on behalf of the band...

807
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,400
...it's kind of a buzz-kill
having you on the tour.

808
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,100
Really? If you hadn't been such a jackass,
I wouldn't have to be here.

809
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,100
Whatever. I just need you
to do a little babysitting...

810
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,100
...and don't rain on my parade, okay?
Because I'm living my dream.

811
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,400
Did you always have that knee brace
in your dream?

812
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,900
What did I say about raining
on my parade?

813
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,900
Sorry. You know what? I'm sorry.

814
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,400
You are an adult. I mean, technically.

815
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,700
You can do what you want. I just think
you might want to start to take it easy.

816
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,500
Take it easy? Thanks, the Eagles.

817
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,800
No. I spent my whole life
taking it easy...

818
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,800
...and now I'm making up
for lost time.

819
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,100
- Hoo-hoo!
- All right.

820
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,600
I'm gonna do whatever I want.
Watch this.

821
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,200
I may go moon a trucker.

822
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,100
Or streak up and down the bus,
or take a nap.

823
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,900
Not sure which. My choice.
Hmm. Make a decision.

824
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,200
I think I'll take a nap. Excuse me.

825
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,700
Okey-dokey.

826
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,500
I have a silly question. Do you
have any hand sanitizer?

827
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,500
I do. I've used it for
other things, but you're welcome to it.

828
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,700
Jesus Christ.

829
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,700
Hello?
- Hey, it's D.V. Put me on shout, yo.

830
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,800
- Hey, are you guys sitting down?
- One second.

831
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,100
- Yeah, well stand up. I got great news.
- Okay.

832
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,300
You're gonna shoot a music video.

833
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,600
Whoo! Yes!

834
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,700
I got us the hottest video director
in town.

835
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,400
Yeah. All right, I gotta go.
I'm in a tremendous amount of pain.

836
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,700
Cut it, please. Cut...

837
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,100
We're rehearsing now.
That means you should move.

838
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,600
Your mouth and your body.

839
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,900
Go backwards in slow motion,
then say the words backwards.

840
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,300
Where's the girl?

841
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,900
Say the words backwards.

842
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,800
In post it's all gonna be forward.

843
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,400
You have to go backwards
for me to make it forward, get it?

844
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,900
- Where's the girl?
- Don't hold your breath.

845
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,100
- What is happening?
- Excuse me, Kip?

846
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,100
- Yes?
- Listen, can we call this a day?

847
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,400
- No. No, this isn't happening.
- Listen to me.

848
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,800
- What's going on?
- Go ahead.

849
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,300
It's Amelia.
She's just having a really tough day.

850
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,900
- Not feeling like a rock star.
- I'll go talk to her.

851
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,800
Okay. Good luck with that.

852
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,500
- Amelia?
Just go away.

853
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,400
Come on, it's okay to be nervous.

854
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,000
I either throw up or get the runs
before every show.

855
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,700
- Last night it was both.
- Gross. Leave me alone.

856
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,200
Come on. Girlfriend, we need you.
Come on.

857
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,000
- I'm sorry. I just can't.
- Hey, what's wrong?

858
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,700
- I told that idiot stylist not to brush it.
- Let me see.

859
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,600
Holy sh... Oh, wow. Hey.

860
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,100
- See? I look like shit, okay? Go away.
- Listen, it's just hair. It's no biggie.

861
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,500
Maybe girls like me
just don't belong in music videos.

862
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,800
You know, if that's the look
that they want, they should just...

863
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,700
...grab one of those annoying little girls
hanging on Curtis.

864
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,300
Don't say that.

865
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,500
Those girls are a dime a dozen.
That is why you are in this band...

866
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:07,400
...and they are not. Because you
have looks and personality.

867
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,300
You've got attitude,
you've got edge...

868
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,600
...you've got pure, unfiltered
badass-ed-ness. Yeah.

869
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Now, as far as the 'do goes...

870
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,700
...take it from someone that's been
at war with their hair.

871
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:25,700
It just needs a little bit of love
and a lot of product.

872
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,300
Welcome back.

873
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,300
Smile? No smile?

874
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,400
Thanks, Fish.

875
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,600
- Good job.
- This part's gonna blow people's minds.

876
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,600
I'm gonna shoot you with this old Bolex,
stop-motion, you're gonna be animated.

877
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,700
So pick your spot, take your breath,
and move a tiny bit.

878
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,700
Move a tiny bit.

879
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,800
Move a tiny bit.

880
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,600
Move a tiny bit. Wait a minute.

881
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,900
- You have a tattoo.
What? Where?

882
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,200
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna get that checked out.

883
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,300
Funny. Good. I'm just saying
it's weird...

884
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,200
...because you have a tattoo,
but you're a mom.

885
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,500
Gee, nothing gets by you, does it?
Yes, I have a tattoo, and I am a mom.

886
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,300
A few too many flirtinis?

887
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,800
Close. It was an old band.

888
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,700
- You were in a band?
- Mm-hm.

889
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,300
I was in an all-girl punk band.

890
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,600
No way. That's awesome.

891
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,100
Yeah. Put a safety pin in my T-shirt
and I'm a badass. Good times.

892
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:47,100
So what happened to the old "S.W."
band? Why'd you give it up?

893
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,000
Well, I'm not exactly sure...

894
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,900
...but I think it had something to do
with the fact that...

895
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,200
...a pregnant 17-year-old lead singer...

896
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,900
...wasn't exactly what MTV
was looking for.

897
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,600
- They so lack vision.
- Cut! You moved too much. Okay?

898
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,500
"Tiny bit" means tiny bit, not big bit
or regular bit. Tiny bit. Move a tiny bit.

899
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,400
I don't know why you're blinking
more than a normal person...

900
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,200
...but blink like a normal person
or don't blink.

901
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
So your choice.

902
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,600
Matt.

903
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,400
- Matt.
- Yeah, you okay?

904
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,200
- Do you sleep with your eyes open?
- No, I'm fine.

905
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,000
Good night.

906
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,000
Hey, can you sign my shirt?

907
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,000
You're... You're very
well-proportioned.

908
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,600
- Hey. Good night.
- Good night.

909
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,800
You Tube sensation A.D.D.
have gone from total unknowns...

910
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,100
... to a top- 10 album,
a number one single...

911
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,500
... and a sold-out tour
in just three short months.

912
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,500
Thank you very much.
You have a great night.

913
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,200
I love you, Matt.

914
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,700
Somebody threw this at me,
and it's got a telephone number...

915
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,200
...an e-mail address, and it's big.

916
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,900
Rock 'n' roll.

917
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,100
- Let me see that.
- Hey, hey. A.D.D., you were amazing.

918
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,700
Oh, wow.
Mattie, oh, it was so incredible.

919
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,700
Everybody loved it and they were
singing along with the words.

920
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,500
They were mouthing your words.
You were good, Fish.

921
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,900
Oh, my goodness. That was great, guys.
Unh! Give it up.

922
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,100
Okay, I understand. Nice. Nicely done.
Here's the plan, okay?

923
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,400
We gotta go down, give some face time
to the fans, then get out of here, okay?

924
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,100
MySpace is throwing you guys a party,
and I don't wanna be late.

925
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,000
Wanna get there before all the good
T-A-l-L is taken, know what I'm saying?

926
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,500
We can spell.

927
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,100
Yeah. Yeah, no, I get that.
That makes sense.

928
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,300
Hello. Hello there. Hi.
I don't think we've been introduced.

929
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,700
- David Marshall, Matchbook Records.
- Hey. Kim Powell. I'm Curtis' mom.

930
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,400
Oh!

931
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,100
The wellspring, huh?

932
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,800
Excuse me?

933
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,800
I would love to spend nine months
inside you.

934
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,900
Why's everybody being quiet?

935
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,000
Ha-ha-ha!
Hoo-hoo!

936
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,300
There it is. It's like a school bus
for assholes.

937
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,300
- I'm not gonna get in that thing.
- That is a nice ride.

938
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,100
- Yeah. Go have fun.
Come on, let's go.

939
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,700
- Oh, wow. Yellow.
- Yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

940
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,200
Okay, let's go.

941
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,300
I'm gonna cut to the chase,
because that's how I do, but...

942
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,000
You're familiar
with the term "MILF"?

943
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,300
Because I would never use that
to describe you, ever.

944
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,500
I hate that term. It disgusts me.

945
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:38,100
No, no, no. you are more
of a "MILMSLT."

946
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,300
That's a mother I'd like to
make sweet love to.

947
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,500
Oh, thank you.
I'm really flattered, actually.

948
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,000
Um, so are you familiar
with the term "PILS"?

949
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,100
No, no, no. What's a PILS?

950
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,500
It's a person I'd like to stab.

951
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,900
- I know.
- Oh, that's good. Watch out here.

952
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,900
Cougar's got claws.

953
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,100
- I'm gonna hop in the Hummer.
- Good idea.

954
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,900
- I'll see you guys in the Hummer.
- Go.

955
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,500
Hit the omelet bar.

956
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,900
- Well played, my lady.
- Shall we?

957
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,300
You know, I'm gonna take a rain check.

958
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,800
Really? You? A rain check, huh?

959
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,200
- Okay.
- Well, you know, I got...

960
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,800
...a date back at the club
with a couple of shorties, so...

961
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,800
- Oh, all right. See you later.
- Okay. All right.

962
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,700
Don't wait up for me, okay,
because I'm gonna be:

963
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,600
- Whoop, whoop! Whoop.
See you.

964
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,500
Mattie?
Hi.

965
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,500
- Hi. Are you okay?
- Oh, super duper. I am just doing...

966
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,900
- This is some...
- Who is she?

967
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,900
I don't know her name.
I've seen her at our shows...

968
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,700
...and I've wanted to engage her,
but I just get so nervous.

969
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,000
- Which one is she?
- She's sitting at the bar, in the blue.

970
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,100
- No. Don't stare.
- I'm not staring.

971
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,200
You're embarrassing me in front of her.
Just be respectful.

972
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,700
She's the one sitting over there
in the blue T-shirt.

973
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,500
Uh, okay. The shirt that reads
"I heart Matt" in rhinestones?

974
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,900
That could be a coincidence.

975
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,900
Maybe it's "I heart Matt" LeBlanc
from TV's the Friends.

976
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,200
Look at me, Amelia.

977
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,300
Look at me. I am not the world's
most handsome guy here.

978
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,300
And...

979
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,000
...I don't know how to speak to a girl,
other than you.

980
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,000
I've never kissed a girl.

981
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:52,500
I've never asked one to go to a movie
or maybe go to dinner, or...

982
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,500
There, okay?
Now you've had the experience.

983
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,900
Now go talk to her
and quit pussing out.

984
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,400
Hi. Nice to meet you.

985
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,800
- Could you sign this, please?
- Oh, yeah.

986
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,100
Yeah, that would be great.

987
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,300
Huh.

988
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,100
Hello?

989
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,500
- Hey. Can I?
- Sure, come on in.

990
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,800
You're back already, huh?
How were the smallies?

991
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,000
Shorties, and I decided to call it
an early night tonight.

992
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,900
Those were some great moves,
by the way.

993
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,600
Yeah, great.

994
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,000
So this is supposed to be a guitar.

995
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,300
Yeah, it's a guitar. It's really fun.
Do you wanna play?

996
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,700
- Come on. Come on.
- All right.

997
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,300
- All right, just put it on. Okay.
- Okay.

998
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,900
See? It goes red, blue.
I'm lost.

999
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,300
- Blue.
- Blue.

1000
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,700
- And hit this so you can get extra points.
- I love this song. This song is awesome.

1001
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,000
You're doing it.

1002
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,900
- I'm kicking your ass is what I'm doing.
- You're not even.

1003
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,700
- Yeah.
- Now we're a rock band.

1004
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,300
Double head.

1005
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,700
May I introduce
A.D.D.'s first video. Pow!

1006
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:15,400
You know, verse, chorus, verse, chorus.
You've heard the song.

1007
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,100
So, what do you think, huh?

1008
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,900
I'm not even embarrassed by it,
and I'm embarrassed by, like, everything.

1009
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,500
Well, your body's changing.

1010
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,900
Don't you hate how the camera itself
adds 10 pounds?

1011
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,100
Yeah. The camera and food, right?
If you like that, you're gonna love this.

1012
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,300
This little puppy...

1013
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:35,300
...is going to debut next Monday
as the number nine video in the country.

1014
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,200
Yeah. All right.

1015
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,100
And you're gonna crap
your khakis when you hear this.

1016
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,000
Y'all just got asked to open
for Vesuvius...

1017
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,500
...in honor of their induction into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Huh?

1018
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,600
That's pretty great, right?

1019
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,300
Like a " Cleveland up-and-comers
open for Cleveland legends" thizz-ang.

1020
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,300
Not to mention, it keeps it all in the
Matchbook family, which is good.

1021
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,000
No. No.

1022
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,300
No, no, no.

1023
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,400
Fish, Fish? Breathe, breathe.
You have to breathe.

1024
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,300
All right. Okay.

1025
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,200
What if I said yes already?
Where does that leave us?

1026
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,600
Oh, God. Okay, all right, Fish?

1027
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,000
- Drama.
No!

1028
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:22,000
- I'll go talk to him.
- No, no. Just sit. I'll do it.

1029
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,200
You guys realize
if you open for Vesuvius...

1030
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,600
...you'll get to play
in front of 20,000 people.

1031
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,600
Fish has a history with them.
We can't do that.

1032
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,500
Look, I love Fish. I do. I love that guy.
And I never say love...

1033
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,600
...but the guy's practically
in a full-body cast.

1034
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,200
You know what I mean? I think it's time
we put him out of his misery.

1035
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,000
Know what I'm saying?
We need to freshen the look of the band.

1036
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,900
- What do you say?
- A band's a family.

1037
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,900
You don't turn your back on family.

1038
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,000
What is this, Full House?
Are you kidding?

1039
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,100
He stays. That's that.

1040
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,500
You know what? You're right.
Yeah. No, he stays. Good call.

1041
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:09,600
- Hey. Fish!
- No, no! I can't do it. I won't do it.

1042
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,100
"Promised Land" is my song.
I came up with the title.

1043
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,100
And they are in the promised land...

1044
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,300
...and I'm walking around in the desert
for 40 years. I'm Moses.

1045
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,700
I led them to the land of milk
and honey and three-ways and orgies...

1046
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,500
- Fish. Listen to me.
- And I'm eating manna...

1047
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,100
I can't... I can't hear you...

1048
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,400
Ooh.

1049
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,800
Hello, Yoko.

1050
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,600
- What was that for?
- To shut you up.

1051
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,800
- Okay.
- Now listen to me.

1052
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,400
You have already made it
to the promised land, okay?

1053
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,800
Not the way you thought,
but you've made it.

1054
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,300
Are you gonna blow this
because of some stupid grudge?

1055
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,900
Come on. Just let it go.
Play the gig. Please.

1056
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,200
Your witchy, witchy ways
won't work on me.

1057
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:08,200
I am never opening for Vesuvius.

1058
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:24,100
Oh, oh, oh. Hey, buddy. Hey, man.
What a coincidence, huh?

1059
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,200
- I didn't know you were staying here.
- Yeah, I love this place.

1060
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,100
Same floor and everything.

1061
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,300
I wanna say
I think it's super awesome...

1062
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,400
...that you're cool with Fish
banging your mom.

1063
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,000
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just saying...

1064
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,500
...it's mature that you approve of him
hitting that sweet stuff.

1065
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:45,200
Cool as a fan, man.
You're a cool, cool kid.

1066
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,600
You're like Vin Diesel
wrapped in a Jeremy Piven pie.

1067
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,300
All right. Here we are.

1068
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,100
You know what? I just realized
I'm not in this hotel.

1069
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,500
Take care, kiddo.
You're a rock star. Whoo!

1070
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,600
If you guys have been dying to spend
some time in Cleveland...

1071
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,800
...come out next month when A.D.D.'s
gonna be doing a free arena show.

1072
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,900
We're gonna be opening up for
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees...

1073
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,900
...the mighty Vesuvius.

1074
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,400
Hey, hey. I thought you said
we weren't gonna do that.

1075
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,300
- I decided we were.
- Guys, we should discuss this later.

1076
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,100
There's no need. It's a done deal.

1077
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,400
I am not doing that, okay?
I am not opening for them.

1078
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,600
You think we should open
for Vesuvius?

1079
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,200
Then you better find a new drummer.

1080
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,800
Know why you're in this band?
You're a joke.

1081
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm not letting
my mom go out with a joke.

1082
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,100
And I'm not missing the show of my life
because of you.

1083
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,800
Ow! Ow!

1084
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,200
What? You've never seen anyone
kick over their drums in anger...

1085
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,300
...jump off the stage
and twist both ankles?

1086
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,900
No.
- Well, now you have. Ow.

1087
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,500
Make a path.

1088
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,600
Oh, no.

1089
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,200
Fish. It's okay. Are you okay?

1090
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,900
Yeah. Yeah.

1091
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,200
- You all right?
- Yeah, top of the world.

1092
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,900
Thanks. My left ankle is making
a pretty serious clicking noise.

1093
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,400
- Yeah, I hear that.
- Yeah.

1094
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,000
Listen. We need to talk to Curtis.

1095
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,300
Fish, we kissed. Once. On tour.

1096
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,300
You know what this is. This isn't real.
In real life, I am Curtis's mom...

1097
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,500
...and you are... Oh, you are just a guy
who won't grow up.

1098
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:39,400
I tried growing up, okay?
For 20 years.

1099
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,600
I tried it. I hated every moment of it,
and I'm not going back to that.

1100
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,800
You never even moved forward.
You didn't give being an adult a chance.

1101
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,100
You're just living in some moment
that happened 20 years ago.

1102
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,600
You said you didn't have it
figured it out either.

1103
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,100
I don't, but at least
I'm living in the present.

1104
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,900
Hello, rat.

1105
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,600
Here we are. Check it out, guys, huh?
Not bad.

1106
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,100
Yeah, yeah.
Uh-oh.

1107
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,200
Who could that be?
Guys, this is your new drummer, Paul.

1108
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,600
Go ahead and get to know him better.
Give him a nickname. Any animal.

1109
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,700
Except Fish. Obviously,
that would be a little awkward.

1110
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,300
Cool. Great. Well, come on.
Let's go. Let's rehearse.

1111
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,300
Set up. Come on.

1112
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:46,100
Yeah, there we go. All right.

1113
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,400
Any last requests?

1114
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,100
Be gentle.

1115
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,700
Robert, I like your résumé.

1116
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:25,800
I certainly love your objectives,
and Stan speaks very highly of you.

1117
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,100
I do notice that your last job
was a few months ago.

1118
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,000
What have you been doing since then?

1119
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,900
He's been taking some time
to recharge the old batteries.

1120
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,600
And now I'm ready to work here
until I die.

1121
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:56,400
I don't even wanna talk to him about it.
It's so frustrating and it's so unfair.

1122
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,000
Hey.

1123
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,800
Hey. We were supposed to start
two hours ago.

1124
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,600
Relax. I figured you guys
could just practice with Paul.

1125
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,200
Ever since you forced Fish out...

1126
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,900
...this went from being a band...

1127
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,100
...to being you
and some people behind you.

1128
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,800
I didn't force him out of the band.
He quit.

1129
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,100
You were mean and manipulative,
and you completely forced him out.

1130
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,400
- This Paul thing is good for us.
- Are you kidding me?

1131
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,000
Look at him. It's like
Abercrombie's making people now.

1132
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,300
We need Fish.

1133
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,700
You know? He's sloppy and stupid,
and he's full of life.

1134
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,900
We're not the same without him.
You know it.

1135
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,900
Okay, yeah. He said
he won't open for Vesuvius.

1136
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:41,100
Curtis, had you gone up to him
and just said it from your heart...

1137
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:45,400
...how important it was for you
and the band, he would have done it.

1138
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,900
- Mattie's right. I mean, he would have.
He would've done it in a second.

1139
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,000
Because he loves you.

1140
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,000
Know what, guys? I'm really not
in the mood to practice.

1141
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,100
I hope you know that I'm getting paid
whether we practice or not.

1142
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,300
Shut up, Paul.

1143
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,600
Hey.

1144
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,500
Hey.

1145
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,400
Listen, I had no idea
real life was so boring.

1146
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,800
And soul crushing.
Don't forget soul crushing.

1147
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,700
That's a nice suit.

1148
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,400
I'm gonna kill you.

1149
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,100
You mind if I sit?

1150
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,100
So...

1151
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:11,100
...Matt says that if I'd asked you
in a nicer way to open for Vesuvius...

1152
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,100
...you'd have said yes.

1153
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,900
Well, even though he's a genius,
he's an idiot.

1154
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,400
I am not opening for no Vesuvius.

1155
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,300
- You're being a baby.
- No, I'm not. I'm being realistic.

1156
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,700
You're telling me Robert Fishman,
a.k.a. Fish...

1157
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:29,400
...has a chance to play Q Arena
in front of 20,000 screaming fans...

1158
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,700
...and he's not gonna take it?

1159
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,900
I saw Ozzy bite the head off a bat
on that stage.

1160
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,300
You could see A.D.D. there with
a really good seat between the guitar...

1161
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,900
...and bass.
- And the bass. Best seat in the house.

1162
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,900
No. No way.

1163
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,800
I am not opening for Vesuvius.
They can open for me.

1164
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,900
It's not fair.

1165
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,900
Of course not. Who said life was fair?

1166
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,700
- Don't be so mature.
- You want my advice?

1167
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,900
You got a good thing going.

1168
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,900
You shouldn't be chasing something
you're never gonna get back.

1169
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,500
Keep stealing my lines,
I'll punch you in the eye.

1170
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:09,100
Let me tell you how it's gonna be.
You're gonna suck it up...

1171
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,300
...because A.D.D. needs a sloppy-ass
Robert Fishman-type drummer.

1172
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,500
It's just one more night, one more show.
Just finish what you started.

1173
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,500
What do you say?

1174
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,900
I say...

1175
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:31,200
...I am the best sloppy-ass
Robert Fishman-type drummer there is.

1176
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,400
- Ow.
- Ooh, I'm sorry.

1177
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,900
Excuse me, everyone?
May I have your attention?

1178
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,200
I want you all to know
that me and my band...

1179
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,200
...are gonna play the Q Arena.

1180
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,600
And I want you to know
it is never too late.

1181
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

1182
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,200
Yeah. All right.

1183
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,200
It is never too late to rock.

1184
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,900
Come on, guys. Let's go. Stage dive.
Stage dive.

1185
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,600
Stage dive.

1186
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,600
We're gonna bodysurf you
on out of here. Come on. Let's go.

1187
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,500
All right. Here we go.
Rock 'n' roll!

1188
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,600
Ow, ow, ow. My carpal tunnel.
Okay, put me down.

1189
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,500
Yes.

1190
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,800
All right. Can you feel the excitement?

1191
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,800
I sat right there for Metallica...

1192
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,100
...way up there for Mötley Crüe,
behind the stage for Van Halen...

1193
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,100
...but I never thought
I would be standing here.

1194
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,900
I'm so nervous.
I'm gonna be sick.

1195
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,700
Act like we're back in the garage.

1196
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:35,800
Yeah, with 20,000 Vesuvius fans
just chilling on the driveway.

1197
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,900
- You think they'll like us?
- We're gonna make them like us.

1198
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:43,200
There they are. Woo-hoo!
A.D.D. Ha-ha!

1199
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:48,300
Fish, dude, so glad to have you
back, bro. For real, for real.

1200
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,000
Everybody at Matchbook is happy
you worked out your thing.

1201
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,700
Well? You ready?

1202
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,900
Let's get ready to do this show.
Come on.

1203
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:00,600
All right. Come on, let's go.

1204
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,900
Okay, guys, follow me.

1205
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,800
I got A.D.D. right here with me.
This way.

1206
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,700
Clear the hall. Vesuvius coming
through. Vesuvius coming through.

1207
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,900
Ha-ha! Uh-oh!

1208
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
A.D.D., let me introduce you
to the mighty Vesuvius.

1209
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,900
David Marshall.
We've met a couple times.

1210
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:10,100
No.

1211
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,500
Sorry.

1212
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:16,600
Hello, kiddies. You're the band
we're supposed to launch.

1213
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,900
Gobsmacked, eh?

1214
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,600
It's all right, mates. It's difficult
to meet your heroes for the first time.

1215
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,500
Why do you guys
have British accents?

1216
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,700
Who's this geezer?
"Why do you have British accents?"

1217
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,100
Hang on. Hang on. We know him, mates.

1218
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,600
Back from when
we were American. Look, it's Fish.

1219
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,900
Who?

1220
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,400
Oh, Trash, Trash, it's Fish. Fishy.
Fish and chips.

1221
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,900
Oh, right.

1222
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,600
Yeah, Fish, having a laugh.

1223
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,200
All right, mate? Sticks, this is the bloke
what you replaced.

1224
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,500
- Hey, that's right.
- Fishy.

1225
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,800
I just wanted to point out
that I'm actually from England.

1226
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:00,400
He's just taking the piss.
You know, one of me mates.

1227
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,300
So, Fish.

1228
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,600
Been busy?

1229
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,300
You know,
I've thought about this moment...

1230
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,900
...every day for the last 20 years...

1231
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:14,600
- Oh...
...wondering what I would say to you...

1232
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,200
...what I would do to you.

1233
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:20,400
And if this was a week ago...

1234
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,900
...I would have attacked you all
like a fierce wolverine.

1235
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,500
I'm glad it wasn't last week, then.

1236
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,400
Pulled the skin from your faces...

1237
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:35,500
...and treated myself to some
human carpaccio or face jerky.

1238
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,600
But that is just not me anymore.

1239
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,000
So I wanna say to you right now...

1240
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,900
...have a great show.

1241
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,300
Oh...

1242
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:49,000
Cheers, man.
Come on, for old times' sake.

1243
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:57,800
Not bad, huh? D.V. coming
through for you. Meeting your heroes.

1244
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,700
Let's do this. Woo-hoo!

1245
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,900
Yeah!

1246
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,300
I know that guy.

1247
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,900
I love you, Matt.

1248
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,700
Yeah! Whoo!

1249
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,000
Yes. Yes!

1250
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,700
You rocked it.

1251
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

1252
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,000
So good.
Yes.

1253
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,700
- Great show.
Yeah, you too.

1254
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:05,400
So I was wondering maybe if later
you'd wanna get a bite to eat.

1255
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,800
Sure. Yeah. I'll tell Mattie.

1256
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,100
I was thinking maybe, you know,
just me and you could go together.

1257
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,700
Oh.

1258
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:18,900
Yeah.

1259
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,700
I mean, you know, that'd be cool.

1260
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,000
All right.

1261
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,900
Hey.

1262
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,100
There it is.

1263
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,300
So good, man. You were so good.

1264
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:36,200
Sweetie, you were wonderful.
Fish, that was awesome.

1265
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,400
Thanks.

1266
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,400
- Nice haircut, by the way.
- Thank you.

1267
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:44,000
I heard women
like a more mature look, so...

1268
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,100
I liked your look.

1269
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:47,700
- Come here.
- Ah, ah.

1270
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:51,000
- I'm kind of... You know? You sure?
- I don't care.

1271
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,300
All hail the mighty...

1272
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:04,300
... Vesuvius.

1273
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,500
Oh, my God. They're lip-synching.

1274
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,700
It's a live mike.

1275
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,000
- They're lip-synching.
- They're lip-synching.

1276
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,100
Get out there and do something.

1277
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,700
Keep going.

1278
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,200
Oh, no.

1279
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,600
We got an Ashlee Simpson
situation here.

1280
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,400
You suck.

1281
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,600
Go back to Cleveland, Cleveland.

1282
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,700
Go away.

1283
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:57,100
You guys suck.
Losers.

1284
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,500
A.D.D. A.D.D.

1285
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:09,500
A.D.D. A.D.D. A.D.D. A.D.D.

1286
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,900
It's insane.
- What do you think?

1287
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,800
I think...

1288
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,600
...they're calling our names.
Come on. Let's roll.

1289
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It is not a good idea to go out there.

1290
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,000
It's Vesuvius' show.
Don't wanna make them look bad.

1291
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,800
And you'll piss off the record company,
which I do not suggest you do.

1292
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,100
These people came here
for live music.

1293
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:34,300
Screw these people. It's a free show,
dumbass. You don't have a choice.

1294
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,500
- David's right.
- Thank you.

1295
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,500
We don't have a choice.
We gotta go up there.

1296
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,700
By the way, you better not be here
when we get back.

1297
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,600
We're gonna look
for new management.

1298
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,700
I love this kid. Love him.
You speak your mind.

1299
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:51,200
You have integrity. You inspire me.
You're like 6, and you inspire me.

1300
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,500
Hey. Read my lips, asshole.
You're fired.

1301
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,000
- Let's go. Come on.
- You're a bad man.

1302
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,200
Come on, guys.
