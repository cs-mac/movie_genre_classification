1
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:47,533
<i>I wrote this story for Renee because</i>

2
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,473
<i>I wanted to believe
in the happily ever after.</i>

3
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,813
<i>Now, her story isn't unique,</i>

4
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:57,953
<i>but she is.</i>

5
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:03,613
<i>The way she speaks the truth.</i>

6
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:05,833
<i>The way she sees the world.</i>

7
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:17,532
<i>Once upon a time there was a girl
who loved fairy tales.</i>

8
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:22,202
<i>Her mind painted the brightest day.</i>

9
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:27,172
<i>And the darkest night.</i>

10
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:39,752
<i>But her imagination turned on her</i>

11
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:44,262
<i>and found her wherever she would hide.</i>

12
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:02,251
It's okay, it's okay now.

13
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,181
There, there, sweetheart.

14
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,481
Good night.

15
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,651
Now, where are we going to go
in our dreams tonight?

16
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,121
My garden.

17
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:17,321
Good, good.
Now you draw your beautiful garden.

18
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:54,970
<i>So she imagined the most beautiful garden.</i>

19
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,600
<i>But even the sun
could not outshine the gray.</i>

20
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,450
<i>When her best friend, Jessie, lost her mom,</i>

21
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,590
<i>she realized not every story has
a happy ending.</i>

22
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,160
<i>So the girl grew up
and left fairy tales behind,</i>

23
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,060
<i>but her music, art and friends
made her feel something...</i>

24
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,940
<i>...even if it wasn't happily ever after.</i>

25
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,740
- Yep?
- Hello?

26
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,370
You left this on the counter last night.

27
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,970
Crazy pills.

28
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,340
No, no, bipolar is not crazy.

29
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,679
What were you doing when the memory part
of my brain was forming?

30
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:47,979
- I forget.
- You what?

31
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:49,989
- Take them.
- Okay.

32
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,839
Only in Orlando.

33
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:24,249
Monday play list. Track four.

34
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,189
One, two, three...

35
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,458
- What?
- Sean sighting.

36
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:12,268
You ladies coming tonight?

37
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,808
I'm not a lady.

38
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,668
- Thanks.
- See you there.

39
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:21,508
He smells like leather.

40
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:23,408
He smells so good.

41
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:27,218
- No. It starts at midnight?
- So?

42
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:29,478
- We can be there for 10 minutes.
- It's Halloween.

43
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,447
- Are you kidding me?
- Who cares? My dad will kill me, Renee.

44
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,517
- You know that.
- He will not.

45
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:36,087
It says dancing on here.
Is it, you know, like sexy dancing?

46
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:39,017
Or, you know,
girls getting really close and...

47
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:41,097
We're going.

48
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,907
I don't want to get shanked
in strobe light hell,

49
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,037
so can we, you know,
please get out of here?

50
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,137
- Yeah, let's bounce.
- Let's explore a little bit.

51
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:01,677
- No.
- Let's explore.

52
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,087
There's nothing over there.

53
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:22,825
- Renee!
- Jessie!

54
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,125
We need to go home.

55
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,595
No. Where'd she go?

56
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:27,825
Where did... Are you drunk now?

57
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:30,165
- It was so beautiful.
- Hey, hey, come on.

58
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:32,595
You know what, this place sucks
and you're trashed and I wanna go home.

59
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:34,135
No, no, no. I like how this place is.

60
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,835
- No, well, I don't care, we're going home.
- You're not my mom, Jess!

61
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:42,545
- Walk your ass home then.
- Why don't you just...

62
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:46,415
Nice one. Way to go.

63
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,885
Don't leave like that.

64
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,425
Don't worry, I got you.

65
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:52,685
That was bad.

66
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:55,255
I'll take you home.

67
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,851
I think these swings are broken.

68
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:16,931
- Need me to push you?
- I think I do.

69
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,361
You're Superman!

70
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:27,841
Michael, come on. Dinnertime.

71
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:37,470
- You wanna get higher?
- Shit, Mackey!

72
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,780
And, yes, I do have the shit.

73
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,950
Come on.

74
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,110
Got it? There you go.

75
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,460
Unbelievable.

76
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,560
Damn kids.

77
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,730
You know what I thought about
the first time I got high?

78
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,790
What?

79
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,930
That Adam and Eve must have been cavemen.

80
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,100
What?

81
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,100
Think about it, we grow up
and they tell us about Adam and Eve,

82
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,840
and then we go to school
and they teach us about cavemen.

83
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,310
The whole point of our education
is to get rid of those fairy tales.

84
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,810
I think Adam and Eve is
the truest story I've ever heard.

85
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,650
'Cause things are perfect
and then you ruin them.

86
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,950
Man's gonna cope.

87
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,660
Speaking of which,
word is it's snowing in Daytona.

88
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,059
- At Echo's?
- Yes.

89
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:31,389
Yes!

90
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,529
- Ready? One, two...
- Go!

91
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,109
Man, leave that poor fish alone.

92
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,409
Children's stories are sick, man.

93
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,479
You got Humpty Dumpty
chillin' on the wall, right?

94
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,579
I wouldn't be on the wall if I was an egg.

95
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:54,879
That's suicidal, man. You know, for real.

96
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:56,919
Maybe he was a crackhead.

97
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:58,319
He was just a dumb egg.

98
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,019
He's not an egg.

99
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,899
- Yeah, he was.
- No.

100
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:07,129
The nursery rhyme never says he's an egg.
The artist drew him like that.

101
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,229
Whatever, man.

102
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,969
The shit's set. Who's in?

103
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:18,009
This ain't free.

104
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:25,448
<i>If you wanna hang out</i>

105
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:28,788
<i>You gotta take her out</i>

106
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:34,558
<i>Cocaine</i>

107
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:40,658
<i>If you wanna get down</i>

108
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:44,898
<i>Down on the ground
Cocaine</i>

109
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:49,908
<i>If you got bad news</i>

110
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:55,578
<i>Gonna kick them blues
Cocaine</i>

111
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:01,318
<i>When your day is done</i>

112
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:04,418
<i>And you wanna run
Cocaine</i>

113
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,318
<i>Cocaine!</i>

114
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:08,688
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

115
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:11,958
<i>Don't forget this fact</i>

116
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:15,427
<i>You can't get it back
Cocaine</i>

117
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:17,697
<i>Cocaine!</i>

118
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:22,907
<i>She don't lie, she don't lie,
she don't lie...</i>

119
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:24,767
Everybody!

120
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:27,677
<i>- Cocaine!
- Cocaine!</i>

121
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:30,477
- One more time, come on.
- One more time!

122
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:33,987
<i>She don't lie, she don't lie,
she don't lie</i>

123
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:37,417

No!

No!

She don't lie, baby!

137
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,206
- Yeah!
- Love cocaine!

138
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:57,553
Hey, where you goin'?

139
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,343
Leave me alone.

140
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:02,013
I do believe you've got something of mine.

141
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:06,993
Come on, baby, get in the... Shit.

142
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,363
Cut her off.

143
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:00,212
Hey.

144
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,252
Hey, it's Renee.

145
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:06,842
<i>I'm sorry to call so late.</i>

146
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:12,092
<i>I kind of need you.</i>

147
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:25,062
- Hey!
- Hi.

148
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:26,962
Look at this ride.

149
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:30,301
No, it's not mine. It's my boss's.

150
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,971
- How you doin'? You look so good.
- Good.

151
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,671
You look... You look so different.

152
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:35,111
Can we go?

153
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,181
Hi, Jess.

154
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,651
Old friends, huh?

155
00:20:56,901 --> 00:21:01,131
So, I'm working
for a big music manager now.

156
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:06,811
By working for him, I mean
I'm just interning, you know, for free.

157
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,611
He still hasn't heard me sing yet.

158
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,651
So why were you in Daytona?

159
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:17,161
Thanks for getting me.

160
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:19,921
So where are we taking you,
your parents' house?

161
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:22,650
Or you wanna go to a crack house
or where do you wanna go?

162
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,630
I don't know yet.

163
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,590
It doesn't matter. Wherever it is,

164
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,790
I have to get the car back to
my manager first and then wherever.

165
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,060
He's your boss.

166
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,740
You have got to be shitting me.

167
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,610
Relax. Okay? This is where my boss is.

168
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,610
It's just... It's kind of crazy that
there's a thing on addiction and stuff.

169
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,380
Wow. What a coincidence.

170
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,590
The way I see it, you kind of owe me one.
All right?

171
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,290
So just think about going in there

172
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,730
and listening to an ex-drug addict
who happens to be my manager.

173
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,890
He's your boss.

174
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,560
My boss slash future manager

175
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,770
is in there talking about
how he used to be a crack whore,

176
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,570
and I would say this is really good timing.

177
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,640
He was a crack whore.
You're calling me a crack whore then?

178
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,739
No, you're not a crack...
It's the first...

179
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,009
It's the only drug slang thing I know.
I don't...

180
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:17,569
What else would I call you?

181
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:19,179
I mean, I'm not calling you that.

182
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:21,549
Just, whatever you do,
if you don't wanna go in there,

183
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:25,059
stay here, I'll be back in 10 minutes.

184
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:26,679
- Okay?
- Fine.

185
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,709
Excuse me.

186
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,879
Can I have a cigarette, please?
If you have an extra one?

187
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:54,909
Thank you.

188
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,699
Rough night?

189
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:07,658
- Rough life.
- Cheers.

190
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:20,768
So are you addicted to Jesus?

191
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:24,638
Doing a favor for a friend. You?

192
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:26,478
Here for the communion wine.

193
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,678
I think it's probably watered down.

194
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:30,318
I'll see you in there?

195
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:32,958
- Nope.
- Okay.

196
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:37,388
Here you go. Not a scratch on it.

197
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:38,958
You rescue your princess?

198
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:44,668
Yeah. This is her, I mean, this is Renee.

199
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:48,268
Pleasure to meet you, I'm McKenna.

200
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:50,298
Princess Renee.

201
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:53,708
So, you're Dylan's manager?

202
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:56,708
Manager? You a rock star now?

203
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:59,707
Well, if you'll excuse me, rock star.

204
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:02,407
That's the crack whore?

205
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:06,007
Don't call him... Between us, all right?

206
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:09,457
All right, are you gonna come in?

207
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:21,127
The very first line of
cocaine that I ever took,

208
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,967
the first bump, if you like,

209
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:27,037
man, I was in love, okay?

210
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,807
It was the love of my life.

211
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:34,747
Any doubt, any insecurity that I had, gone.

212
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:37,747
It was bigger than my job,
bigger than my family,

213
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,817
my friends, you know, bigger than me,

214
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:41,617
and I was a god, remember?

215
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:45,757
I think rock bottom for me

216
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:50,086
was a three-day cocaine binge.

217
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:53,726
I was a mess. I was, you know, bloody nose

218
00:24:53,736 --> 00:24:56,526
and I wasn't sleeping obviously

219
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,466
and I'd run out, I couldn't get anymore.

220
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:01,806
So I was scrabbling around on the floor

221
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:05,816
looking for crumbs in the carpet.

222
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:11,876
And I drank a bottle of vodka
and my heart stopped and I flat lined.

223
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:17,046
I actually ended up withdrawing on my own
at my parents' house,

224
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,956
I was

225
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:21,116
lying on my... My parent's couch

226
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:24,696
and my father just sitting there

227
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:27,036
holding my hand and...

228
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:29,906
He had his other hand on my head

229
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:33,896
the way that...

230
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:39,136
I don't have any conclusions for you guys.

231
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:41,276
I'm very much a work in progress myself.

232
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:43,875
But if you take anything from today,

233
00:25:43,885 --> 00:25:46,815
let it be that addiction is real.
It's bigger than you are.

234
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:02,835
Shit, shit!

235
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:02,024
I know a place.

236
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:05,894
- You want me to make a...
- Yes, yes.

237
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:11,664
You know, down there
there's a trampoline, somewhere.

238
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:16,804
Renee Yohe?

239
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:33,583
So I'll take it. When can I move in?

240
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:39,093
So do you have drugs in your system?

241
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:42,103
Yeah. Don't most people who come here?

242
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:48,033
So what drugs have you taken
in the last 72 hours?

243
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,873
Some uppers, mostly just coke.

244
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:52,363
That it?

245
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:55,573
Alcohol.

246
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:59,743
Ecstasy, but not that much.

247
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:05,313
What about legal drugs, prescriptions?
You know, for conditions.

248
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:11,423
I'm here because I have a drug problem.
Not prescription drug problem.

249
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:14,963
You ever been diagnosed
with any mood disorders?

250
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:20,832
Miss Yohe?

251
00:28:20,902 --> 00:28:25,772
I don't see how that has
anything to do with anything. Sorry.

252
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:30,402
How long have you
been off your medication?

253
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:31,912
Are you gonna let me in or no?

254
00:28:31,952 --> 00:28:33,512
Is my audition finished?

255
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:36,022
You need a dance
or a little song or something?

256
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:39,312
No, but I do need to see your arm.

257
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:42,282
Congratulations, guys.

258
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:46,452
You brought me to the only rehab
that doesn't take drug addicts.

259
00:28:46,462 --> 00:28:47,522
I didn't make the cut, let's go.

260
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:49,592
- This isn't a detox center, you know that.
- Yeah, but...

261
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,062
You need to bring her
back when she's clean.

262
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,462
- Are you kidding me?
- Like... Is that a joke?

263
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:55,002
- Guys...
- Guys, just give me a second.

264
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:57,402
Conrad, let her detox here.
What's the problem?

265
00:28:57,672 --> 00:29:00,272
We're not equipped, we're not insured
to deal with detoxing.

266
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:02,702
You can't take drug addicts?
Then who gets rehabbed here?

267
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:04,282
Bring her back in five days.

268
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:06,672
She can't sit in a room
without drugs for five days.

269
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:08,082
That's why we came here.
That's why she's here.

270
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:09,842
Okay, everybody just needs to calm down.

271
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:12,311
No, you don't understand how hard it was
to get her here.

272
00:29:12,321 --> 00:29:16,621
Stop! Stop! This is why I can't.

273
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:24,161
Let's just go, please.

274
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:36,911
My God. Who does that?

275
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:38,111
So how do you know this girl?

276
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:41,371
We just met.

277
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:45,221
Come on, let her in.

278
00:29:45,891 --> 00:29:49,481
Look, you saw her arm.
She could trigger the other girls. I can't...

279
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:51,921
I can't risk a fresh cut.
You know the deal, David.

280
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:53,791
Just bring her back.

281
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:55,231
Hey.

282
00:29:55,831 --> 00:29:59,231
Where you been,
why haven't I seen you at meetings lately?

283
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,731
You know, business.

284
00:30:01,741 --> 00:30:03,970
Yeah. I know bullshit.

285
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,170
This might be a very good thing
to happen for you, you know.

286
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,040
- Nothing is happening to me.
- Five days, no drugs, no new cuts.

287
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,540
I can't commit to that!

288
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,450
Well, I remember somebody
committing to that for you.

289
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,210
- You're an asshole.
- Bring her back.

290
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,490
I can't do that.

291
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,390
Wow, I haven't seen your parents
in, like, forever.

292
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,900
Yeah, me neither.

293
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,500
- Renee!
- Hey, baby!

294
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,570
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you in forever.

295
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,670
Think you can stay?

296
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,040
April, honey, go inside, please.

297
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,210
Can Renee come in?

298
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,850
Honey, inside, please.

299
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,759
- Hey, Dad.
- Hello, Renee.

300
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,429
I...

301
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:03,599
I'm gonna go to rehab in a few days.

302
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:06,729
Good, good, that's really good.

303
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,029
And I just need to...

304
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,339
Actually, I was wondering if I could
stay here for, like, just until I go.

305
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,169
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

306
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:18,709
Crap.

307
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,679
He's not gonna let her stay.

308
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:22,709
Can she stay at your place?

309
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:26,449
No. My dad's not into sleepovers.
Not since my mom died.

310
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:27,959
She can stay with me.

311
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:29,619
Yeah, that's a great idea, Dylan.

312
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:31,119
What's wrong with his?

313
00:31:31,129 --> 00:31:33,949
I don't know.
Just his mother being a raging alcoholic

314
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,359
might get in the way. No big deal.

315
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,659
Dad, I literally don't have anywhere else
I can go.

316
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:42,359
I'm sorry. I promised myself
it wasn't going to happen again, okay?

317
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:45,369
And the last time you stayed here,

318
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:48,069
- it was your... Please just listen to me.
- I know... No, don't...

319
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,898
It was your sister who found your blood.

320
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,238
Okay, I am aware of that.
It's not going to happen ever again.

321
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:55,818
You don't understand, Dad.
If you don't let me stay here...

322
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:57,318
- No, I do understand.
- ...I have nowhere else to go.

323
00:31:57,488 --> 00:32:00,018
Five minutes.
Thank you, thank you very much.

324
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,078
- David?
- Yes?

325
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,148
- Can she stay with you?
- No, she can't.

326
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,678
I can't let it happen to your sister
and I can't...

327
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:07,458
Dad, you can't!
You have to let me stay here.

328
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:09,918
- Please.
- No. She's your friend, mate.

329
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,258
But you just stood up in church and said

330
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:12,988
how important it is for people
to have strong support.

331
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,558
I know what I just did and I am having
a tough time at the moment, Dylan.

332
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,328
- I've got a lot on my...
- Please. I know. So is she!

333
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,128
- You love me so much?
- I would do anything for you, but...

334
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,198
You don't want me to sleep in my room
so I can get better?

335
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,668
- Dylan, please.
- ...go home to something like this.

336
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:24,338
- Can I just have five seconds to try...
- She trusts you.

337
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:27,078
- And you have a huge house.
- You have a huge house?

338
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:29,408
- Well, it's big!
- Fine!

339
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:33,148
You shut up, and you stop sulking,

340
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:35,718
and you're all staying at my place.

341
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:36,978
...one of the things I can't do...

342
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,148
You would not do anything

343
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:39,988
because you're not letting me sleep
where I need to sleep!

344
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:41,117
Mr. Yohe, my name's David McKenna.

345
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,957
Do you mind if Renee stays with me
for a couple of days?

346
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,227
She's gonna need to get some things.

347
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:17,997
Lovely.

348
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:28,197
You moving out or you moving in?

349
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,437
Not sure yet.

350
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:30,567
This is fancy.

351
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:33,876
- Hey, Renee.
- Yep.

352
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:38,916
In this house
there's no booze and no drugs. Okay?

353
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:42,046
Just sleep, coffee and cigarettes.

354
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:44,286
My number one rule, we don't get tired
and we don't get hungry.

355
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,586
Okay.

356
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:49,526
- You in?
- I'm in.

357
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,256
Let's do it.

358
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:56,756
Okay, kitchen, my quarters, hot tub,
you lot can park it upstairs,

359
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:59,126
middle room's my office, no kids allowed.
We clear?

360
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:02,006
And you got first dibs. You two...

361
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:11,906
Addiction is a very
complicated relationship.

362
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,106
We've been friends with Renee
for, like, 12 years.

363
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:16,206
- Trust me, we know.
- Okay, all right.

364
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:17,656
This is not Renee.

365
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:22,156
<i>You have to hink Invasion of
the Body Snatchers or something, okay?</i>

366
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:26,155
Every single thing in her,
every fiber of her being

367
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:28,495
wants one thing, is
thinking about one thing,

368
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:31,465
cares about one thing and it's not you,
and it's not me.

369
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:33,565
It's drugs, okay?

370
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:35,335
So what do we do?

371
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,635
What we do is...

372
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:40,765
Okay, the game plan is distractions,
distractions, distractions. Okay?

373
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:43,375
Dylan, you're on snack duty, okay?

374
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:46,385
Take Renee, don't let her out of your sight.
Come straight back.

375
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:49,015
She'll ask you to go someplace else,
you don't go, you don't deviate,

376
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:51,445
you come back here.
Half an hour, 30 minutes. All right?

377
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:53,825
Or I'm coming after you. Jessie?

378
00:34:54,455 --> 00:34:57,285
Jessie, take all the knives and anything
sharp in the house and hide them.

379
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:59,255
You want me to
hide all the knives in the house?

380
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,255
Did you see her arm?

381
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:05,635
Look, all the ways you want to punish Renee
for being a shit friend

382
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:07,795
will pale in comparison to the ways
Renee will punish herself.

383
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,835
Now get on with it.

384
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:12,435
All right, let's go.

385
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:15,615
Dylan? Don't forget my Lucky Charms.

386
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:24,224
Animal crackers! Oh, yes!

387
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,544
I missed you.

388
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:31,864
Yeah, I mean, why did we stop hanging out
in the first place?

389
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:35,124
What is this? What are we doing?
We're hanging out.

390
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,824
We used to hang out,
like, every day together

391
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,324
and now you're a completely
different person

392
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:41,564
doing different things and I don't know...

393
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,804
Different things?

394
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:45,934
You know what I'm talking about.

395
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:47,944
- I know what you're talking about.
- You know.

396
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:50,514
Why did you do that to your arm?

397
00:35:52,854 --> 00:35:54,944
It just looked right.

398
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:58,984
Well, I like the way you look without it.
'Cause it's not true.

399
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,584
Crap, sorry. I didn't know this was...

400
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:03,854
No, no, no. I got this. I got this.

401
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:05,584
Okay.

402
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:01,431
Whoa, McKenna, whoa!

403
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:03,101
Jamie!

404
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:06,081
You nearly gave me a heart attack,
you wanker.

405
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,651
When did we start sounding the alarm?

406
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:09,211
Today.

407
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,341
And when did we get new friends?

408
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,811
Keeping her safe.

409
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:15,081
- Obvious enough.
- Renee,

410
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:18,681
meet Jamie, my sometimes housemate,
who I'm guessing missed his flight.

411
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:20,081
Jessie. Good night.

412
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:22,551
Dylan took your room,
so you can bunk with him.

413
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:26,121
All right! Bunk buddies. See you up there.

414
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:29,571
This is David McKenna.
Everything's fine, false alarm.

415
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,171
Want some Lucky Charms?

416
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:45,541
I know this isn't any of my business,
but you all right, Renee?

417
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:48,020
Piano-czar.

418
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,650
- A coozer?
- It's coke and booze together.

419
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,120
I made it up, do you like it?

420
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,390
Yeah. I don't think McKenna coozes much.

421
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,430
He's such a quitter.

422
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,100
So what's you're... Who do you...
What's your deal?

423
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,100
I'm actually a lot more
interested in you right now.

424
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,270
I'll bet.

425
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,940
I need a place to detox for a few days
till I go to rehab

426
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,150
and McKenna is donating to my charity.

427
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,950
Nosy.

428
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,590
I didn't mean to be nosy.

429
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm just really...

430
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,630
That's really brave.

431
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,890
I'm happy for you.

432
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,190
Why doesn't he have knives?

433
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:43,059
So what do you do?

434
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:48,369
I am a rep for a surf company.

435
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:52,719
McKenna's nice enough to let me crash here
when I'm in town.

436
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:55,089
- You're like a traveling salesman?
- Yeah.

437
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:57,209
Legit job.

438
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:00,119
Office. Grown-up stuff.

439
00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:03,519
But what I really wanna do is write.

440
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,259
You like Paper Route?

441
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:10,359
They're playing at
the Florida Music Fest tomorrow.

442
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,199
Yeah. We should go.
You think the warden will let you out?

443
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:15,569
I will dig my way out.

444
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:17,999
Right on.

445
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:21,499
So you out tomorrow morning or...

446
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:24,069
Actually the day after,
if that's okay with you.

447
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,779
Yeah, the more the merrier.

448
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:28,549
All right, thank you.

449
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:30,489
No problem.

450
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,858
Appreciate it.

451
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:38,248
And congratulations on
your new life, Renee.

452
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:41,758
- Good night.
- Bye!

453
00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:48,328
Pretty good.

454
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:51,168
How are you feeling?

455
00:40:51,538 --> 00:40:53,408
Like my soul got kicked in the nuts.

456
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:56,038
Good.

457
00:40:56,148 --> 00:41:00,618
Well, not good that you feel
like your soul's been kicked in the balls,

458
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:04,348
but it's good you're being honest.
Secrets make you sick.

459
00:41:05,218 --> 00:41:06,658
I like that, McKenna.

460
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:08,918
- Remember it.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:14,218
Thank you

462
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:16,928
for all of this.

463
00:41:18,198 --> 00:41:20,358
Somebody did it for me,
you'll do it for someone else.

464
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:24,067
All right, thanks for the sandwich.

465
00:41:24,677 --> 00:41:26,337
Sleep tight.

466
00:41:42,757 --> 00:41:44,327
This is slave labor.

467
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:46,497
I prefer the term internship.

468
00:41:46,497 --> 00:41:48,327
It's all gonna be back next week.

469
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:50,927
So will you. It's a test of wills, mate.

470
00:41:51,837 --> 00:41:53,667
- Hey.
- There she is!

471
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,897
You all right, sleeping beauty?

472
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:02,907
You have an extra one of those...
Thank you.

473
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:05,707
Hey, boss?

474
00:42:05,787 --> 00:42:08,817
I have three...
No, I have four questions for you.

475
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:11,817
- I'll answer two. Maybe.
- Okay.

476
00:42:11,817 --> 00:42:13,647
One, why don't you have any furniture?

477
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,277
Two, where'd you get your tattoo,

478
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:20,196
three, how come you left England,
and four, I'll ask you later.

479
00:42:20,226 --> 00:42:21,916
One, I just haven't found
the right sofa yet,

480
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:25,126
I wish people would stop pressuring me,
and two, I got that bad boy in prison.

481
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,796
Prison? What did you do?

482
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,236
Only answering two questions.

483
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:32,566
- Hey! Right on.
- Hey, Jamie!

484
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:33,736
Looking great, guys.

485
00:42:33,946 --> 00:42:36,466
So what are you doing
your last night in Orlando?

486
00:42:36,476 --> 00:42:39,016
I was thinking Florida Music Fest.

487
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:42,246
I mean, your band's playing, right?
We'll all go together.

488
00:42:42,456 --> 00:42:45,786
You have bands? McKenna, I wanna go.

489
00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:48,786
One band, and, no, you can't go,
you're staying with the babysitters.

490
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:50,946
I thought she needed distractions.

491
00:42:50,956 --> 00:42:54,056
Yeah, if there's music,
I'm not thinking about drugs.

492
00:42:54,096 --> 00:42:57,186
No, there's no drugs at a music festival.
It's a great idea.

493
00:42:57,466 --> 00:43:00,126
Exactly. I don't have extra tickets anyway,
so it's settled.

494
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,356
Turns out Hurley's sponsoring the event.

495
00:43:01,366 --> 00:43:05,066
Made a call, got us VIP treatment
and Paper Route's playing.

496
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:09,305
And we'll be there
to support your band, Between the Trees.

497
00:43:09,345 --> 00:43:10,505
Why thank you, Jamie.

498
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:16,505
<i>What would you say if I told you
that I'm not giving up?</i>

499
00:43:16,515 --> 00:43:19,815
<i>However long it takes</i>

500
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,985
<i>It's clear that things have changed</i>

501
00:43:24,995 --> 00:43:26,855
<i>Since when we started</i>

502
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:30,425
<i>But we can't just walk away, babe</i>

503
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:33,255
<i>So I am telling you that</i>

504
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:39,775
<i>I know things aren't quite
like what they used to be</i>

505
00:43:41,805 --> 00:43:43,805
<i>Different faces,
different places</i>

506
00:43:43,845 --> 00:43:47,645
I needed this. Thank you.

507
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:51,275
You're welcome.

508
00:43:53,785 --> 00:43:57,015
Boys, nice one, well done, more of
the same please. That was the bollocks.

509
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:58,685
So when are we gonna meet Stevo?

510
00:43:58,695 --> 00:44:00,954
Just let me handle the business.

511
00:44:00,964 --> 00:44:02,924
You're going to meet him
right after the second set.

512
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,864
Go make daddy proud.

513
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:12,364
<i>Where have I landed
I don't quite remember</i>

514
00:44:12,374 --> 00:44:17,604
<i>I fell to pieces
one night in December</i>

515
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:21,074
<i>The memories of losing you</i>

516
00:44:21,084 --> 00:44:23,504
<i>You're like a ghost</i>

517
00:44:23,514 --> 00:44:27,114
<i>Tracing where I said to you</i>

518
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:29,784
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

519
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:31,944
- Lift me up!
- Oh, no!

520
00:44:31,954 --> 00:44:35,894
Yes, Dylan, lift me up!
Lift me up! Come on!

521
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:38,554
Please, you guys, if anyone
is doing drugs up there,

522
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:40,254
I will come right down immediately.

523
00:44:40,464 --> 00:44:41,964
They might be.

524
00:44:42,004 --> 00:44:44,094
No, no, no. McKenna will kill me.

525
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:46,194
- Please, please, Dylan.
- Just watch from right here.

526
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:48,364
Come on, one...

527
00:44:48,904 --> 00:44:50,464
Be right back?

528
00:44:50,474 --> 00:44:53,943
Girl scout's honor. One, two, three!

529
00:44:54,983 --> 00:45:00,013
<i>Looking for love like
a bride looks for dresses</i>

530
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:03,443
<i>The memories of losing you</i>

531
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:05,953
<i>You're like a ghost</i>

532
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:09,323
<i>Tracing where I said to you</i>

533
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:12,153
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

534
00:45:12,163 --> 00:45:14,793
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

535
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:17,363
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

536
00:45:17,373 --> 00:45:19,233
<i>To get through it</i>

537
00:45:19,773 --> 00:45:22,203
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

538
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,433
McKenna?

539
00:45:23,443 --> 00:45:24,903
- Stevo.
- What's up?

540
00:45:24,913 --> 00:45:26,033
- How you doing?
- Good.

541
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:27,303
- Safe trip?
- All good.

542
00:45:27,313 --> 00:45:30,873
Okay, good. Anyway, listen,
are you a Between the Trees fan yet?

543
00:45:31,683 --> 00:45:34,343
- We'll see.
- Okay.

544
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:35,543
When can I meet the band?

545
00:45:35,553 --> 00:45:39,353
I'll introduce you right after the second set.
Listen, would you excuse me a minute, yeah?

546
00:45:39,923 --> 00:45:41,483
Hey, where's Renee?

547
00:45:41,493 --> 00:45:42,583
She's up there, we just put her up there.

548
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:47,462
Tell me you are joking. You put her up there?
We're at a music festival!

549
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:49,662
It's fine, McKenna!

550
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:51,562
Well, she's not there now!

551
00:45:51,572 --> 00:45:53,632
I told you this was a bad idea!

552
00:45:53,642 --> 00:45:56,532
Okay, Jessie, you go that way,
you get back in the crowd

553
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:59,012
and you come with me!

554
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:11,612
- Yohe! Yohe!
- Hey!

555
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:14,982
Where you been?
What happened to you back in Daytona?

556
00:46:14,992 --> 00:46:16,752
What, you get saved or kidnapped
or something?

557
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:19,852
A little bit of both.
I lost my group I came with.

558
00:46:20,232 --> 00:46:24,272
Why don't you get in,
I'll take you around the front by the stage.

559
00:46:30,172 --> 00:46:34,102
Hey, wanna go downtown?
I got some mad snow not far from here.

560
00:46:34,112 --> 00:46:36,682
No, no more snow. I'm done with that.

561
00:46:36,682 --> 00:46:39,841
Two days sober, man, three days to rehab.

562
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:41,311
How Hollywood of you.

563
00:46:41,321 --> 00:46:43,481
Come on, you sure you don't want
to go out with a bang?

564
00:46:43,491 --> 00:46:45,181
No. Take me back.

565
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:46,851
All right.

566
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:53,421
- Renee!
- Hey, hey, hold on.

567
00:46:53,931 --> 00:46:57,621
Hey, all right. Thanks.

568
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:59,431
Sure thing. Stay safe.

569
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,831
Yeah, you too. Hey.

570
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:04,901
Is that one of your boyfriends?

571
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:07,301
What's your problem? No, no.
What's your problem?

572
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:09,671
Did you just go use with that guy?

573
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:11,971
- Did I just use with that guy?
- Did you just go use with that guy?

574
00:47:11,981 --> 00:47:14,371
No, I didn't go use with that guy, Jess!

575
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:17,111
Just go home, dude, if you don't want
to be here, you don't have to be here.

576
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:18,281
I'm sure you'd love that, wouldn't you,

577
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:20,181
so you could have a house full of men
all to yourself, right?

578
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:22,661
What are you talking about?

579
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:24,721
We used to be a family.

580
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:27,321
- Do you know how much that means to me?
- Yes.

581
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:31,790
You gave up everything for some prick
at a bullshit rave.

582
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,330
Whoa, you don't know
what happened with Sean. Okay?

583
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,530
I don't care what happened, Renee,
'cause it's not about Sean,

584
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,040
it's about you giving up everything
for the slightest bit of attention.

585
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,300
Listen to me right now.

586
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,350
I will tell you everything right now. He...

587
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,740
Stop right there. Just stop right there.

588
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,270
I don't care and I don't want to hear it.

589
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,280
I'm so sick of
hearing your stories and your sadness

590
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:55,450
and seeing your pity scars
all over your body.

591
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,550
I'm so sick of it. I'm done.

592
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,390
<i>I want to see what I dream</i>

593
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,760
<i>I want the inconvenience</i>

594
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:08,030
<i>I hope you see that
when you fall in love...</i>

595
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:35,659
Stevo, no, no, Steve's fine, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he loved it.

596
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:38,019
Yeah, he really did, yeah.

597
00:48:38,029 --> 00:48:41,159
Yeah, something came up.

598
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:44,999
Just let me deal with the
contracts, all right?

599
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:49,439
No, no, no, no, I'll be there. Yeah.
No, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

600
00:48:50,049 --> 00:48:51,129
Yeah, okay.

601
00:49:08,229 --> 00:49:10,799
You going out for a smoke?

602
00:49:15,438 --> 00:49:17,598
Don't you have a plane to catch?

603
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:21,668
It's delayed till we get you to rehab.

604
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:28,108
When I was a little kid I used to say that
planes were like these big friendly giants

605
00:49:28,778 --> 00:49:34,288
and if I had, like, a bad dream, bad idea,

606
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:38,988
a plane would just fly them away.

607
00:49:39,528 --> 00:49:41,188
Sounds beautiful.

608
00:49:45,168 --> 00:49:47,458
Just wanna escape all this shit.

609
00:49:50,638 --> 00:49:53,938
Yeah, you know, you remind me
of my friend, Zeke.

610
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:55,698
Zeke.

611
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:58,508
He'd say the worst part of his day
was the paddling back to shore.

612
00:49:58,848 --> 00:50:01,308
- Surfing?
- Yeah. He was a surf buddy.

613
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:05,948
He died two months ago.

614
00:50:06,758 --> 00:50:12,687
Took his own life. Now, I don't know
if I could have said something.

615
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:17,817
But I wanna be the guy
who can say the right thing.

616
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:19,527
You know?

617
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:25,367
I think people might need more than words.

618
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:28,167
Maybe.

619
00:50:33,317 --> 00:50:38,547
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think I... I think.

620
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:42,947
Is she okay? Is she all right?

621
00:50:44,627 --> 00:50:46,347
- No.
- Need some water?

622
00:50:46,597 --> 00:50:48,717
- A blanket?
- She needs a bed.

623
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:52,757
Here's a bucket, in case you need to...

624
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:56,197
- I'm so cold.
- It's all right, I got it.

625
00:50:58,407 --> 00:51:02,726
My dad put this by my bed
every time I was ill.

626
00:51:02,736 --> 00:51:04,066
Let me get you some water.

627
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:09,176
Is this normal?

628
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:11,236
This is the worst part.

629
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,706
Great.

630
00:51:13,716 --> 00:51:15,256
I'll be next door, okay?

631
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:18,856
Yeah, hang in there.

632
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:47,016
I missed you.

633
00:51:50,886 --> 00:51:52,255
You wanna go for a ride?

634
00:51:53,295 --> 00:51:55,015
No.

635
00:52:12,745 --> 00:52:14,175
Am I ever going to be okay?

636
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:20,985
Why did you make me like this?

637
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:37,995
No, ma'am. What are you thinking...

638
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:42,965
<i>She's hurting herself.
She's cutting herself,</i>

639
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:45,764
<i>and I don't understand.
What is wrong with her?</i>

640
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:50,274
<i>Those pills are nothing. I don't want her...
I don't want her taking all those pills,</i>

641
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:51,874
<i>do you understand?</i>

642
00:52:52,814 --> 00:52:54,344
<i>Why does she keep doing these things?</i>

643
00:52:54,354 --> 00:52:57,314
<i>It doesn't help to ask why.</i>

644
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:02,154
<i>Why can't we help it? Why is she doing
these things? She's hurting herself.</i>

645
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:18,853
What did I say?

646
00:54:18,863 --> 00:54:23,563
All business comes and goes through me.

647
00:54:23,573 --> 00:54:26,703
No, that's... No, I...

648
00:54:26,713 --> 00:54:29,602
No, you... No, you...

649
00:54:29,612 --> 00:54:32,642
Will you let me speak? Please?

650
00:54:32,742 --> 00:54:35,402
You really wanna have this conversation?

651
00:54:35,412 --> 00:54:41,212
Three months ago you were performing
for a bunch of drunks in a bloody toilet.

652
00:54:42,052 --> 00:54:43,782
Don't you ever speak to me like that!

653
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:48,892
Shit!

654
00:55:02,142 --> 00:55:03,402
Patio.

655
00:55:18,162 --> 00:55:19,882
It's nice, huh?

656
00:55:29,331 --> 00:55:32,301
- Bombay Bitches.
- What?

657
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:35,361
Your third question.
The reason I left England.

658
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:39,031
For a band.
I got stuck here in Orlando for a few more.

659
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:41,041
Bombay Bitches.

660
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:48,641
Yeah, yeah, all right, I do know it,
you can stop, thank you.

661
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:53,181
They were also the reason
I hit rock bottom fairly predictably.

662
00:55:53,261 --> 00:55:58,191
So is that how you did it?
You started over somewhere new and...

663
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:02,001
No. That didn't work for me.

664
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:04,931
The problem was always me.

665
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:08,531
Wherever I went, there I was.

666
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:12,731
A friend once said to me
that I should never be left unattended

667
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:15,040
because what I get back to is me.

668
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,210
And me is the problem.

669
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,540
You need other people.

670
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,580
What's today's date?

671
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,090
The 15th.

672
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,290
- I have to go somewhere. Please.
- Not a chance.

673
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:35,460
Please, please. I'll take Dylan.
It'll be fine. Please. It's important.

674
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,630
Take Dylan. One hour.
I'm trusting you, all right?

675
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,200
Thank you.

676
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,810
Your dad said you were here.

677
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,920
I'm really sorry we forgot.

678
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,749
I miss you.

679
00:57:09,999 --> 00:57:11,259
It was like you died too, you know.

680
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:15,699
I didn't.

681
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:20,109
I miss her so much and
I can't lose you, too.

682
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:30,379
Why did you stop calling us?

683
00:57:30,959 --> 00:57:32,919
It was just overnight,
you just stopped calling us.

684
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:38,649
I just...

685
00:57:39,629 --> 00:57:44,189
Something happened
and I just didn't want to talk about it.

686
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:50,369
I wanted to be alone and it just got...
It got out of hand.

687
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:52,769
What are you talking about?

688
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:54,609
Halloween party.

689
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:00,708
Sean pulled over in a parking lot
so I could throw up.

690
00:58:13,398 --> 00:58:14,988
<i>And he raped me.</i>

691
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:23,608
I mean, we had no idea.

692
00:58:24,078 --> 00:58:25,938
I'm so sorry.

693
00:58:26,038 --> 00:58:28,668
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

694
00:58:29,978 --> 00:58:34,608
I'm sorry about everything I said at
the concert. I'm sorry about everything.

695
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:36,478
I'm sorry.

696
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,208
Will you please come back to McKenna's?

697
00:58:39,218 --> 00:58:42,658
I'll come back. I promise.

698
00:59:49,956 --> 00:59:51,586
All right, everyone, pay attention.

699
00:59:51,596 --> 00:59:54,816
She is never alone. Got it?

700
00:59:54,826 --> 00:59:57,356
And no crowd surfing
in the record shop, please,

701
00:59:57,366 --> 00:59:59,656
thank you very much, if you don't mind.

702
01:00:00,136 --> 01:00:01,396
Daja Grace.

703
01:00:01,406 --> 01:00:04,406
- I think it's Dasia, isn't it?
- Man.

704
01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:05,796
- What?
- Look.

705
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:08,266
- You don't need that.
- I know.

706
01:00:08,276 --> 01:00:13,906
It's just the idea of eternal sobriety
scares me very much.

707
01:00:14,116 --> 01:00:15,506
- One day at a time.
- Right.

708
01:00:15,516 --> 01:00:16,606
Yeah.

709
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:19,986
At least that's what my mom said
right before she relapsed.

710
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:22,176
Good.

711
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,596
Now that is impressive.

712
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:31,066
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

713
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:32,826
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

714
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:37,025
The metalmark is the most
beautiful butterfly.

715
01:00:37,035 --> 01:00:40,505
And it's the most fragile,
as it only lives a week.

716
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:43,935
Isn't that sad?

717
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,835
I wanted to ask you something.

718
01:00:46,845 --> 01:00:50,345
- Yeah?
- Don't get angry. It's kind of crazy.

719
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,785
I love crazy. I'm insane.

720
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:58,085
I want to write. I want to tell your story.

721
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:02,455
- You want to write my story?
- Yeah, I do.

722
01:01:03,365 --> 01:01:08,955
It's powerful and because nobody says...

723
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:13,305
Nobody talks about all the things
that happen to you.

724
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,465
- You know?
- I know.

725
01:01:14,475 --> 01:01:16,875
And I just... I think it will help somebody.

726
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:20,775
- Oh, God.
- You think it'll help...

727
01:01:20,785 --> 01:01:22,305
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no!

728
01:01:22,315 --> 01:01:26,785
Jamie, I'm just...
You think it could help people, like...

729
01:01:28,124 --> 01:01:29,584
Yeah, I do.

730
01:01:31,594 --> 01:01:33,984
Okay, then do it. Sure.

731
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:36,714
<i>Thanks for coming out to open mic night.</i>

732
01:01:36,724 --> 01:01:40,824
<i>- First up is Dylan Landers. Dylan?
- What?</i>

733
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:44,924
Shit! Did you hear that?

734
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,304
Get your stuff. We're going to the front.

735
01:01:48,774 --> 01:01:50,804
Hello.

736
01:01:50,814 --> 01:01:53,034
<i>My name is Dylan.</i>

737
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:54,674
<i>Sorry.</i>

738
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:56,304
<i>So this is a...</i>

739
01:01:56,314 --> 01:01:59,804
<i>I've never really done this before.
This is my first time.</i>

740
01:01:59,814 --> 01:02:03,374
<i>So today, tomorrow, actually,</i>

741
01:02:03,384 --> 01:02:08,514
<i>my best friend, Renee, is going to rehab.
For drugs. And...</i>

742
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,984
<i>Not, like, to get drugs, but...
'Cause they don't...</i>

743
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:12,424
<i>I don't think they have drugs there.</i>

744
01:02:12,434 --> 01:02:14,894
<i>So I want to sing a song for her.</i>

745
01:02:14,904 --> 01:02:16,964
<i>It's sort of like...</i>

746
01:02:16,974 --> 01:02:19,693
<i>It's kind of like a prayer in reverse.</i>

747
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:22,103
<i>No, it's like, it's good. Here it goes.</i>

748
01:02:29,443 --> 01:02:35,313
<i>Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry</i>

749
01:02:35,323 --> 01:02:41,413
<i>You don't know how lovely you are</i>

750
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:47,423
<i>I had to find you
Tell you I need you</i>

751
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:52,663
<i>Tell you I set you apart</i>

752
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:58,933
<i>Tell me your secrets
Ask me your questions</i>

753
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:04,003
<i>Oh, let's go back to the start</i>

754
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:09,773
<i>Nobody said it was easy</i>

755
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:15,182
<i>It's such a shame for us to part</i>

756
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:21,532
<i>Nobody said it was easy</i>

757
01:03:22,162 --> 01:03:28,072
<i>No one ever said
It would be this hard</i>

758
01:03:30,142 --> 01:03:34,232
<i>I'm going back to the start</i>

759
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:50,622
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

760
01:03:50,632 --> 01:03:51,822
That was a fun day, right?

761
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:54,392
Yeah, fun, fun.

762
01:03:56,902 --> 01:03:58,792
Flying out?

763
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:02,492
Yeah, I'm taking
the big friendly giant tomorrow.

764
01:04:02,502 --> 01:04:04,471
No, don't steal my line.

765
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:12,841
I have a little... I have a little...
I just wanna give you something.

766
01:04:12,851 --> 01:04:15,471
- But it's weird.
- All right.

767
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:17,921
Okay. Ready?

768
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,251
Here, hold it like...

769
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,351
Okay.

770
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:29,091
I don't trust myself with it and I...

771
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:31,831
I would like to throw it away.

772
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:37,601
But maybe you can do that instead.

773
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:51,241
- Okay.
- Thank you.

774
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:58,380
- Let's take a ride.
- Okay.

775
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,230
Come on.

776
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:22,740
Can you believe
he still drives the same stupid truck?

777
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:26,110
Sean is a janitor now. He's a real winner.

778
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,350
- Take the first one?
- No.

779
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,150
Take it.

780
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:31,620
Come on, we're not doing this.

781
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:32,750
- Take it!
- This is stupid. No.

782
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,690
- I'm not doing this. I wanna go back, please.
- Hey, Renee.

783
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,560
You need this. You don't even understand
how bad you need this.

784
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:41,230
I don't need this. I don't need this.
I don't need this.

785
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,790
He took you from us.
He took you from everything.

786
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,860
Stop!

787
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:46,430
Please, I can't. I can't right now.

788
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,499
Please. Just forget it.
It was a long time ago.

789
01:06:30,749 --> 01:06:32,719
You don't have to...

790
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:38,519
Thank you.

791
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:41,518
I've got something for you.

792
01:06:43,298 --> 01:06:45,518
I got this at three months sober.

793
01:06:45,528 --> 01:06:47,728
It's your watch thingy.

794
01:06:47,738 --> 01:06:49,228
Here, look.

795
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:52,598
No way.

796
01:06:54,408 --> 01:06:58,868
"God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

797
01:06:58,878 --> 01:07:02,968
"the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference."

798
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:05,638
You have to wind it every day.

799
01:07:05,648 --> 01:07:09,508
It's a little reminder
to take it one day at a time.

800
01:07:09,518 --> 01:07:11,678
You're like my fairy godmother.

801
01:07:11,688 --> 01:07:13,818
Did you just call me a fairy?

802
01:07:13,828 --> 01:07:15,398
Yes.

803
01:07:20,938 --> 01:07:23,938
Don't say it. Don't say a word.

804
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,378
- Love you.
- Love you too.

805
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,547
- How you doing?
- Better.

806
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:44,587
Good. Welcome back.

807
01:11:10,623 --> 01:11:12,213
<i>In our local hero report,</i>

808
01:11:12,223 --> 01:11:16,123
<i>one young man is making a difference
in the lives of young people in crisis.</i>

809
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:19,823
<i>Jamie Tworkowski wrote a story
about a local girl, Renee Yohe,</i>

810
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:23,233
<i>who was suffering from addiction,
depression and bipolar disorder</i>

811
01:11:23,733 --> 01:11:26,293
<i>and got clean with the help of her friends.</i>

812
01:11:26,303 --> 01:11:30,433
<i>He posted her story on Myspace titled
"To Write Love On Her Arms"</i>

813
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:32,073
<i>and it quickly went viral.</i>

814
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,573
<i>Remembering her scars,</i>

815
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:37,973
<i>he printed the unusual logo on T-shirts
to raise money for her treatment.</i>

816
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,473
<i>Friends in bands
started to wear our T-shirts.</i>

817
01:11:40,483 --> 01:11:42,443
<i>You know, they were really
generous with their platform.</i>

818
01:11:42,453 --> 01:11:45,313
<i>Then something crazy
and unexpected happened.</i>

819
01:11:45,323 --> 01:11:47,653
<i>Thousands of young adults found the page</i>

820
01:11:47,663 --> 01:11:51,923
<i>and wrote about their own struggles
of depression, addiction and isolation,</i>

821
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:56,592
<i>and an online community was born
and became a legitimate social movement.</i>

822
01:11:56,602 --> 01:11:59,332
<i>Jamie now runs the nonprofit organization</i>

823
01:11:59,342 --> 01:12:02,962

824
01:12:02,972 --> 01:12:06,232
<i>Renee Yohe has become a role model

825
01:12:06,242 --> 01:12:09,812
<i>and will be speaking at an event
this Friday in Orlando.</i>

826
01:12:10,782 --> 01:12:13,652
You know, most people are celebrities
before they go into rehab.

827
01:12:14,492 --> 01:12:17,342
Next week no one will care.
Don't worry.

828
01:12:17,352 --> 01:12:20,912
Well, if this is McKenna's doing,
I'll skin him alive.

829
01:12:21,862 --> 01:12:23,182
Did you give him this?

830
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:26,732
No, no. That's a story
he'll have to tell you.

831
01:12:30,032 --> 01:12:31,432
Oh, boy.

832
01:12:31,442 --> 01:12:34,132
Yeah? You ready for this?

833
01:12:35,412 --> 01:12:36,602
I don't know.

834
01:12:36,612 --> 01:12:38,332
Six months is not a long time.

835
01:12:38,782 --> 01:12:40,572
Thanks, Doc.

836
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:44,812
Hello.

837
01:13:10,411 --> 01:13:12,271
Renee...

838
01:13:14,111 --> 01:13:16,741
Sorry, we didn't know if the surprise
was appropriate or anything.

839
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:19,011
What's going on?

840
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:21,441
- It's like so intense.
- I know.

841
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:25,251
I have a manager now
and we're playing some shows

842
01:13:25,261 --> 01:13:27,551
- and I really want you to come because...
- Shut up. Oh, my God!

843
01:13:28,191 --> 01:13:30,021
Dylan's a pro.

844
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:32,291
Where's McKenna?

845
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:34,161
He's taking a break sort
of from everything.

846
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:35,261
What do you mean?

847
01:13:35,271 --> 01:13:37,301
His band fired him.

848
01:13:37,671 --> 01:13:38,831
- No way.
- Yes.

849
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:40,190
But he'll be back in a few days.

850
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,630
- He's just sorting things out.
- Okay.

851
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,700
Is it my fault?

852
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,670
- No, no, no.
-'Cause he was babysitting me?

853
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,730
- No.
- Yeah, it is.

854
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:49,070
- No. I would seriously tell you...
- Hi.

855
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,440
I'm going to go make out with your dad.

856
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:58,950
You want some sobriety cake?

857
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:02,080
- It's so good.
- Is it?

858
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,090
This is my second piece,
but I ate the first one in hiding.

859
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,300
Are you okay?

860
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,500
Yeah.

861
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,300
I'm good. It's just a little weird.

862
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,300
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

863
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,470
'Cause what are we celebrating, that I'm...

864
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,480
It's like, "You're normal, yay, party!"

865
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,870
Well, if you don't want anybody
to be here right now,

866
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,970
- we can get them out.
- Oh, my God, Jess. Jess.

867
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:28,070
Renee!

868
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:29,910
Hey!

869
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,109
Hi!

870
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:33,689
I'm so proud of you.

871
01:14:35,089 --> 01:14:36,779
- Thank you.
- How are you feeling?

872
01:14:36,789 --> 01:14:39,489
- Much better.
- You look amazing.

873
01:14:41,299 --> 01:14:45,129
Thanks for all your notes
and sending me letters and all that stuff.

874
01:14:45,139 --> 01:14:46,529
Of course, of course, of course.

875
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:48,599
We have so much to catch up on.

876
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,799
- It has been a whirlwind!
- I know.

877
01:14:49,809 --> 01:14:50,929
I want you to come down to the office,

878
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:54,479
I want you to see everything that
you've created and what's happened.

879
01:14:55,179 --> 01:14:56,439
It's beautiful.

880
01:14:56,449 --> 01:14:58,109
That'd be great, yeah, I'd love to.

881
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,269
Maybe respond to a few e-mails, yeah?

882
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,039
Sounds good.

883
01:15:02,049 --> 01:15:03,279
- Okay?
- Yeah.

884
01:15:03,289 --> 01:15:06,289
Babe, come meet Renee!

885
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:07,479
Hi.

886
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:10,119
It's so nice to finally meet you!

887
01:15:10,129 --> 01:15:12,919
Renee, this is Amanda. She's my girlfriend.

888
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:15,559
She's down from New York
for the show on Friday.

889
01:15:15,569 --> 01:15:18,059
Yeah. Jamie talks about you all the time.

890
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:19,929
He's so proud of you.

891
01:15:19,939 --> 01:15:23,299
And I can't wait for the event on Friday.
It's going to be amazing.

892
01:15:25,008 --> 01:15:27,368
Are you looking forward to it? Are...

893
01:15:28,478 --> 01:15:32,138
Well, anyway,
it's nice to finally meet you,

894
01:15:32,148 --> 01:15:35,138
and I can't wait for Friday, and...

895
01:15:35,148 --> 01:15:36,238
And we've got to catch up.

896
01:16:55,697 --> 01:16:57,657
- It's like it happened overnight, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

897
01:16:57,797 --> 01:17:00,267
We've had this office
for a couple months now.

898
01:17:01,337 --> 01:17:05,127
In this room we put some of the letters
from, you know, our followers.

899
01:17:05,137 --> 01:17:06,197
Hey, Renee.

900
01:17:06,207 --> 01:17:07,267
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

901
01:17:07,277 --> 01:17:08,337
That's cool.

902
01:17:08,347 --> 01:17:10,136
They write to us, you know.
They just want to have a voice.

903
01:17:10,146 --> 01:17:11,206
Yeah.

904
01:17:11,216 --> 01:17:14,146
Come on in.
These people just want someone to talk to,

905
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:16,436
someone to hear them.

906
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:17,506
Yeah.

907
01:17:17,516 --> 01:17:18,946
And they feel safe with you.

908
01:17:18,956 --> 01:17:21,016
So just click on the messages.

909
01:17:22,526 --> 01:17:24,686
<i>- And voilà.
- Yeah.</i>

910
01:17:24,696 --> 01:17:27,386
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

911
01:17:28,026 --> 01:17:30,186
- Be right across the hall.
- All right.

912
01:17:36,136 --> 01:17:40,026
<i>I can't do life anymore.
I just want to die.</i>

913
01:17:40,036 --> 01:17:41,976
<i>Everything's so messed up.</i>

914
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:45,206
I don't have friends like you.

915
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,476
Why are you so special?

916
01:17:50,816 --> 01:17:55,716
I'm writing this 'cause
nobody knows about the scars on my chest.

917
01:17:58,026 --> 01:18:00,096
Who am I supposed to tell?

918
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:06,165
<i>Hi. My...</i>

919
01:18:07,195 --> 01:18:09,595
When I was 12, my dad molested me.

920
01:18:09,605 --> 01:18:11,295
Okay.

921
01:18:23,045 --> 01:18:26,775
It's the only time that I agree.
I know. It was so embarrassing.

922
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,745
You know what,
would you at least put on your robe

923
01:18:28,755 --> 01:18:30,515
before you run for the paper every Tuesday?

924
01:18:30,525 --> 01:18:32,055
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

925
01:18:43,605 --> 01:18:45,665
Then the band will play
and I'll introduce you.

926
01:18:45,675 --> 01:18:48,795
And then you speak.
Have you written something up?

927
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:51,435
- About what?
- Your story.

928
01:18:53,614 --> 01:18:56,574
It's kind of a personal story.
Don't you think?

929
01:19:00,814 --> 01:19:03,914
Hey, guys, would you mind helping me
put the T-shirts in the van?

930
01:19:06,294 --> 01:19:08,124
You got a sec?

931
01:19:10,724 --> 01:19:12,694
What's going on?

932
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:18,604
What... Why did you write this?

933
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:20,864
For you.

934
01:19:23,244 --> 01:19:28,004
For me? Really? How... All this is for me?

935
01:19:28,584 --> 01:19:29,974
Yeah.

936
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:33,374
I'm sitting at the airport

937
01:19:36,124 --> 01:19:38,314
and I can't stop thinking about you.

938
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:41,284
You and these five days.

939
01:19:41,524 --> 01:19:46,283
I just started writing and writing, and
my heart poured out and it was beautiful.

940
01:19:46,293 --> 01:19:48,223
And it was about you.

941
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:55,463
So then why didn't you just send it to me?

942
01:19:56,243 --> 01:19:59,463
Because I thought about Zeke,

943
01:19:59,473 --> 01:20:01,773
and I thought about all the people,

944
01:20:03,313 --> 01:20:05,773
all the people
who were in similar circumstances

945
01:20:05,783 --> 01:20:11,653
and I wanted people to know
that recovery is possible.

946
01:20:15,923 --> 01:20:20,123
What if I'm not recovered?

947
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:24,223
What are you talking about?

948
01:20:26,173 --> 01:20:27,423
Talk to me. This is...

949
01:20:27,433 --> 01:20:29,293
This is me, all right, you know?

950
01:20:29,303 --> 01:20:31,203
Put all this aside.

951
01:20:31,943 --> 01:20:34,303
Do you need to go back to rehab?

952
01:20:36,613 --> 01:20:39,502
No. I'm fine.

953
01:20:39,512 --> 01:20:40,572
Renee, we can pay for it.

954
01:20:40,582 --> 01:20:43,012
I'm fine.

955
01:20:44,722 --> 01:20:49,412
- I just am nervous. Just nervous.
- Yeah.

956
01:20:53,162 --> 01:20:56,292
All right. I'm here if you need me.

957
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:38,960
- Hey! Hey.
- Hey!

958
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:40,360
How are you feeling?

959
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,960
I just wanted to see you
and talk about some...

960
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:45,230
It's a bit of a mess. Just hang on a sec.

961
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,930
I'm just going to clean up.
I've been... Had the... Find some...

962
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,400
So you got fired, huh?

963
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:53,070
- What's that, sorry?
- You just got fired

964
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,070
and now you have to sell your loft
because of me.

965
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,510
No, no. It's just... It's...

966
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,080
It's too big anyway for me.

967
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:04,850
I'm just... No, I've got, you know,
irons in the fire...

968
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,150
What's wrong with you?

969
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,620
I'm just excited, you know?

970
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:13,060
I've got a lot of stuff going on at the moment.
It's really a busy time for me.

971
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:14,190
Yeah.

972
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:16,169
Look what I got.

973
01:23:16,599 --> 01:23:17,799
Your watch.

974
01:23:18,139 --> 01:23:19,799
- And it... Yeah?
- Yeah.

975
01:23:19,809 --> 01:23:20,859
All right.

976
01:23:20,869 --> 01:23:23,569
Well, listen, I'm so sorry I couldn't come,

977
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:28,369
and, you know, have a chance to...

978
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:32,379
To come get you out, meet you out of there.

979
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:38,859
Listen, I'm sick.
So maybe don't catch germs from that.

980
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:43,659
So what did you want to talk to me about?
What's the trouble?

981
01:23:55,839 --> 01:24:01,109
I wanted to know how you stayed sober
for so... Such a long time.

982
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:10,948
- You just take it one day at a time, you know?
- Yeah?

983
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:14,488
Easy, easy does it is what we...

984
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:20,028
You know, you have to wind this or else...

985
01:24:20,728 --> 01:24:22,888
I told you, you have to wind it.

986
01:24:25,168 --> 01:24:28,238
You forgot to hide a
bottle over there, buddy.

987
01:24:35,948 --> 01:24:37,738
I lost the band.

988
01:24:40,988 --> 01:24:45,578
I'm eating crap. I lost the band.
I'm not doing great, okay?

989
01:24:45,588 --> 01:24:47,518
It's been a tough time.

990
01:25:01,307 --> 01:25:02,567
Okay.

991
01:25:02,577 --> 01:25:05,037
I don't have anybody, okay?

992
01:25:05,777 --> 01:25:07,397
I don't either.

993
01:25:09,717 --> 01:25:10,807
Renee, come on!

994
01:25:15,887 --> 01:25:17,617
Renee!

995
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:34,997
- Hey! Have you guys seen Renee?
- Hey!

996
01:25:35,007 --> 01:25:36,097
- No.
- No.

997
01:25:36,107 --> 01:25:37,597
I've been trying
to get a hold of her all day.

998
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:38,737
Why, did something happen?

999
01:25:39,277 --> 01:25:42,107
You know, it's nothing.
She just wasn't herself yesterday.

1000
01:25:42,117 --> 01:25:44,437
- Did she say anything?
- No.

1001
01:25:44,447 --> 01:25:47,487
I'm going to call her.
I'm sure it's fine. I'm going to call her.

1002
01:26:29,796 --> 01:26:33,226
Hey! My truck! What the hell?

1003
01:26:34,996 --> 01:26:36,796
You have a kid?

1004
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:39,196
Boy or girl?

1005
01:26:40,206 --> 01:26:43,996
- Boy or girl?
- A little girl. A girl.

1006
01:27:13,365 --> 01:27:15,125
Oh, God!

1007
01:27:17,175 --> 01:27:18,895
Look who it is! Yohe!

1008
01:27:19,745 --> 01:27:24,305
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Check this out, check this out!

1009
01:27:24,985 --> 01:27:28,205
This is my new favorite shirt.
I love wearing this thing.

1010
01:27:28,815 --> 01:27:30,445
So does that mean that you're...

1011
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:34,375
'Cause you're wearing the shirt,
you're sober 'cause...

1012
01:27:34,385 --> 01:27:37,344
Me? No, I mean,
I don't like getting high in your shirt.

1013
01:27:37,354 --> 01:27:40,784
So there's some internal conflict going on.

1014
01:27:40,794 --> 01:27:44,954
Man. You! You sobriety celebrity you!

1015
01:27:44,964 --> 01:27:47,154
Dude, I don't want to talk about this.

1016
01:27:47,464 --> 01:27:49,764
Aren't you supposed to be
at that party right now?

1017
01:27:49,774 --> 01:27:53,134
I'm the last person who should be
telling anyone how to live their lives.

1018
01:27:53,604 --> 01:27:56,404
I was in rehab for six months.

1019
01:27:57,444 --> 01:28:01,374
I am exactly the... I'm exactly the same.

1020
01:28:01,384 --> 01:28:06,384
The thing that people love about you
and your story is that it's honest.

1021
01:28:07,054 --> 01:28:10,754
You're sad. Shit happens.

1022
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:14,014
You're trying, okay?

1023
01:28:14,024 --> 01:28:16,394
Even if it's just a little bit.

1024
01:28:17,164 --> 01:28:19,324
Where else you got to go tonight?

1025
01:28:22,934 --> 01:28:26,524
<i>I wrote this story for Renee  because</i>

1026
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:32,173
<i>I wanted to believe
in the happily ever after.</i>

1027
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:34,633
<i>Now, her story isn't unique,</i>

1028
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:36,943
<i>but she is.</i>

1029
01:28:38,953 --> 01:28:43,113
<i>The way she speaks the truth.</i>

1030
01:28:43,123 --> 01:28:45,813
<i>The way she sees the world.</i>

1031
01:28:47,763 --> 01:28:50,793
<i>And I pray that never changes.</i>

1032
01:28:51,463 --> 01:28:55,163
<i>Now, Renee was
supposed to be here tonight.</i>

1033
01:28:56,033 --> 01:28:58,163
<i>But she couldn't make it.</i>

1034
01:28:58,703 --> 01:29:03,213
<i>But in the spirit of Renee,</i>

1035
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:07,173
<i>we should open it up to you out there.</i>

1036
01:29:07,883 --> 01:29:10,843
<i>Now, we've got some friends who are
going to be bringing microphones around.</i>

1037
01:29:10,853 --> 01:29:16,013
<i>They're going to bring them down the aisles.
Let's stand up and tell our story.</i>

1038
01:29:21,392 --> 01:29:23,022
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1039
01:29:25,462 --> 01:29:29,522
<i>The first time I ever thought about suicide</i>

1040
01:29:29,672 --> 01:29:34,002
<i>was around the same time
I started pulling my hair.</i>

1041
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:38,162
<i>Two weeks ago,
I did a search for ways to end it</i>

1042
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:42,642
<i>and I found the To Write Love site.</i>

1043
01:29:43,082 --> 01:29:44,812
<i>I read Renee's story.</i>

1044
01:29:45,982 --> 01:29:50,082
<i>I wasn't used to hearing
other people hurting.</i>

1045
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,922
<i>Her story helped me find hope.</i>

1046
01:29:55,962 --> 01:29:57,492
<i>Thank you.</i>

1047
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:02,592
<i>Anybody else?</i>

1048
01:30:03,432 --> 01:30:04,562
<i>Hi.</i>

1049
01:30:05,872 --> 01:30:07,442
<i>Hello.</i>

1050
01:30:08,772 --> 01:30:10,242
<i>That was...</i>

1051
01:30:10,912 --> 01:30:12,602
<i>Thank you.</i>

1052
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:17,231
<i>I'm not sure what to say,
but my friends are here</i>

1053
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:22,981
<i>and I know they're worried about me.</i>

1054
01:30:24,551 --> 01:30:28,951
<i>They think I'm better, and I'm not.</i>

1055
01:30:29,761 --> 01:30:33,821
<i>But I think that's okay,</i>

1056
01:30:35,201 --> 01:30:37,201
<i>'cause I have them.</i>

1057
01:30:46,211 --> 01:30:48,441
<i>Secrets make you sick.</i>

1058
01:30:49,151 --> 01:30:54,651
<i>Somebody that I love told me that
and it's true.</i>

1059
01:30:58,091 --> 01:31:01,881
<i>'Cause when I finally asked for help,
I got it.</i>

1060
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:09,030
<i>And when my friend asked me for help,
I just...</i>

1061
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,930
<i>I didn't give it to him.</i>

1062
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:23,770
<i>I think what this whole thing is about</i>

1063
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,040
<i>is what I'm going to go do</i>

1064
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,980
<i>right now. So thanks.</i>

1065
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:40,890
<i>Thank you.</i>

1066
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,200
<i>Anybody else?</i>

1067
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:57,140
McKenna?

1068
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:45,119
Clever. Clever.

1069
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:48,189
Conrad said I should ask you about that.

1070
01:32:55,068 --> 01:32:56,728
My father put me in prison.

1071
01:32:59,208 --> 01:33:04,438
Well, selling a shitload of cocaine
put me in prison,

1072
01:33:05,518 --> 01:33:07,638
but my father turned me in.

1073
01:33:09,848 --> 01:33:12,718
I think he knew
it was the only way I'd get clean.

1074
01:33:16,658 --> 01:33:19,958
And I hated him for it, I hated him for it.

1075
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:23,558
And I told him in a letter.

1076
01:33:25,398 --> 01:33:28,658
And in return, he sends me this.

1077
01:33:31,408 --> 01:33:33,808
I never knew why he didn't drink,

1078
01:33:35,948 --> 01:33:38,908
and, well, it turns out,
"Like father, like son."

1079
01:33:40,278 --> 01:33:42,318
He died while I was in there.

1080
01:33:46,417 --> 01:33:50,077
So "James Terrance McKenna."

1081
01:33:53,397 --> 01:33:56,487
So I guess
that's all your questions answered.

1082
01:33:59,267 --> 01:34:00,527
I'm sorry.

1083
01:34:01,067 --> 01:34:04,327
- It's all right. It was a while ago.
- No.

1084
01:34:04,337 --> 01:34:07,237
I'm sorry I left you.

1085
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,377
I called Conrad.

1086
01:34:15,277 --> 01:34:16,647
You did?

1087
01:34:17,317 --> 01:34:21,747
Yep. Asked him if he had
any room at the inn.

1088
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:26,587
I told him I'd prefer to get sober
in an all-girls facility.

1089
01:34:29,627 --> 01:34:32,427
<i>We all wake to the human condition.</i>

1090
01:34:32,437 --> 01:34:35,896
<i>We wake to mystery and beauty,</i>

1091
01:34:35,906 --> 01:34:39,096
<i>but also to tragedy and loss.</i>

1092
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:42,436
<i>Millions of people know
that pain is very real.</i>

1093
01:34:43,746 --> 01:34:46,836
<i>We also know that hope is real.</i>

1094
01:34:46,846 --> 01:34:51,576
<i>When Renee came to us,
we became her hospital, her church.</i>

1095
01:34:51,586 --> 01:34:54,546
<i>Coming alive to meet her needs,</i>

1096
01:34:54,556 --> 01:34:56,976
<i>to write love on her arms.</i>

1097
01:34:56,986 --> 01:34:58,916
<i>Rescue is possible.</i>

1098
01:34:59,156 --> 01:35:01,416
<i>God is still in the business of redemption.</i>

1099
01:35:03,066 --> 01:35:06,726
<i>The first step to recovery
is the hardest to take.</i>

1100
01:35:07,366 --> 01:35:09,226
<i>But it's worth it.</i>

1101
01:35:09,906 --> 01:35:12,526
<i>Life is worth fighting for.</i>

1102
01:35:26,886 --> 01:35:31,375
Hi, I'm Jamie Tworkowski,
founder of To Write Love on Her Arms.

1103
01:35:31,385 --> 01:35:32,815
Millions of people around the world

1104
01:35:32,825 --> 01:35:36,655
struggle with depression, addiction,
self-injury and suicide.

1105
01:35:36,665 --> 01:35:38,825
There's a stigma that
if you struggle with these things,

1106
01:35:38,835 --> 01:35:40,785
you're not supposed to talk about it.

1107
01:35:40,795 --> 01:35:43,955
But I'm here on behalf of people
literally choosing to stay alive

1108
01:35:43,965 --> 01:35:46,495
and choosing to believe
that life can change.

1109
01:35:46,505 --> 01:35:49,365
If you're struggling, or if there's
someone you're concerned about,

1110
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:51,165
please know you're not alone.

1111
01:35:51,175 --> 01:35:54,335
It's okay to be honest
and it's okay to ask for help.

1112
01:35:54,345 --> 01:35:58,575
You are living a story, and it's our hope
that you will never give up on that story.

1113
01:35:59,655 --> 01:36:01,705
To Write Love on Her Arms
still exists today.

1114
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:04,315
We respond to every single message
that comes in,

1115
01:36:04,325 --> 01:36:06,915
and there are more ways than ever
to get involved.

1116
01:36:25,044 --> 01:36:27,104
<i>I called you from the hospital</i>

1117
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:29,534
<i>You didn't pick up the phone</i>

1118
01:36:29,544 --> 01:36:33,104
<i>I was left alone
with the crazy fishes</i>

1119
01:36:33,114 --> 01:36:35,744
<i>Swimmin' in their senseless circle</i>

1120
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:37,814
<i>All of us together</i>

1121
01:36:37,824 --> 01:36:41,444
<i>Smashing our faces in the glass</i>

1122
01:36:41,454 --> 01:36:46,124
<i>This repetition's definition
could be insanity</i>

1123
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:48,994
<i>But flip a switch
and check the sky as I go</i>

1124
01:36:49,004 --> 01:36:53,164
<i>Just gotta keep trying</i>

1125
01:36:53,174 --> 01:36:56,934
<i>Had to keep trying</i>

1126
01:36:58,574 --> 01:37:02,804
<i>I had said
that I'd be better</i>

1127
01:37:02,814 --> 01:37:05,974
<i>Told you
I'd never fall again</i>

1128
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:11,644
<i>Countless times
and you believed me</i>

1129
01:37:11,654 --> 01:37:15,313
<i>But I let you down again</i>

1130
01:37:15,323 --> 01:37:20,023
<i>I'm not asking you to answer</i>

1131
01:37:20,033 --> 01:37:22,723
<i>I can tell this is the end</i>

1132
01:37:22,733 --> 01:37:28,533
<i>So I'm goin' to leave you at the tone</i>

1133
01:37:36,243 --> 01:37:40,473
<i>I know that I won't spend
my whole life in a cell</i>

1134
01:37:40,483 --> 01:37:44,513
<i>I will keep fighting
and so be righting myself</i>

1135
01:37:44,523 --> 01:37:48,813
<i>mmm!</i>

1136
01:37:48,823 --> 01:37:50,613
<i>Even when it's dismal</i>

1137
01:37:50,623 --> 01:37:52,983
<i>paw-lawman!</i>

1138
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:57,123
<i>I had said that I'd be better</i>

1139

01:38:22,722 --> 01:38:24,512

1146
