00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,239
<i>This story happened before
insider trading was penalized.</i>

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,950
<i>Any resemblance to a bank or banker
is purely coincidental.</i>

3
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,554
- Hello, Mr Julien.
- Hello.

4
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,359
Good morning, Mr Julien.

5
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,030
Good morning.

6
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,788
How's the new mum?

7
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,677
Much better.

8
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,717
Five kilos is quite a push!

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,593
Certainly is.

10
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,990
Five kilos!

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,468
BANK ERROR IN YOUR FAVOUR

12
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,792
<i>Leg oflamb, pommes risolées.</i>

13
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,591
Monday: lunch with Mr Gontran Gerbeau
de la Roche, director of EURoLEC.

14
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
Serve him separately, no salt.

15
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,235
Wednesday:
Mr Stuart Nelson, chairman of KKS.

16
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,789
Check we have enough
Château Angelus.

17
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,513
We need a new maid,
Caroline had words with Mr d'Espinasse.

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,353
I'll see to it.

19
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,234
Julien, my dear...

20
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,112
we're all going to miss you.

21
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,032
You're very kind, Madame Brière.

22
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,350
But it was inevitable.

23
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,268
The gentlemen prefer
eating out nowadays.

24
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,511
You're taking it philosophically.

25
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,159
But I'll bounce back.

26
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,114
It may be my chance
to attain my dream.

27
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,312
I'll tell you about it soon.

28
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,595
of course.

29
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,232
- Pommes rissolées...
- Yes?

30
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,951
... would be better with two Ss.

31
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,631
You want to snap up Blue Mineral?

32
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,791
The stocks dropped 2% again today.

33
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,918
Alban, we don't follow the trend,
we create it.

34
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,191
Blue Mineral is signing a billion euro
contract with Australia.

35
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,278
Highly confidential...

36
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,836
David, tell Madame de l'Epée

37
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,479
it's settled for her son.

38
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,711
His dispensation has been granted.

39
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,478
<i>About Blue Mineral,</i>

40
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,233
can you trust your source?

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,991
Sandrez told me himself.

42
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,038
It's good we put him on the board.

43
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,191
He's as crooked as they come.

44
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,759
That's why they took him on.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,834
<i>Blue Mineral should shoot up
25% - 30% today,</i>

46
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,196
<i>so we should make about 80 million.</i>

47
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,628
Excellent! I'll tell my son to buy.
It'll pay for his divorce.

48
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,829
But using this information
is blatant insider trading.

49
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,510
The Market Authorities
will certainly...

50
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,758
He's a beginner.

51
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,033
- But sir...
- Alban.

52
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,315
Yes, sir.

53
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,554
You know the root
of the word "scruple"?

54
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,677
From the Latin scrupulus.
A little pebble...

55
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,631
<i>... in a Roman soldier's sandal
that can hold up a whole army.</i>

56
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,918
A silly little pebble.

57
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,358
How about Total Finances?

58
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,797
A loser! And a dead loss
in heavy going.

59
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,156
Black Money's the one to go for.

60
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,278
Black Money?
He should be turned out to grass!

61
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,999
Look at this.

62
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,555
Incredible!

63
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,712
Thermal shock.
Cold sauce, hot plate.

64
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,836
Taste it.

65
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,719
Fresh Noirmoutier soup,

66
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,520
with a whiff of citrus fruit,
cumin leaves...

67
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,197
And a flavour from my childhood.

68
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,272
- It's...
- Gingerbread.

69
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,150
And orange blossom water too.

70
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,958
You're an artist, Etienne.

71
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,594
The world will know it.

72
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,519
Hey, Harmony!

73
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,236
Rosemary on the strawberries?
At today's prices!

74
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,469
Tasted his marvel?

75
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,711
The potato soup? Do me a favour!

76
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,951
I've been scouring the chipmaker!

77
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,428
It's not worth it.

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,240
- He's pissing off!
- He'll be back in an hour.

79
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,516
Treat him properly. He's Picasso.

80
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,039
So what? I'm not an art dealer.

81
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,591
Well?

82
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,677
Have a look.

83
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,115
We start with 20 place settings,

84
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,394
then we expand in here...

85
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,716
You see?

86
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,916
And we move up a slot.

87
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,875
So you want to open
your own business?

88
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,759
No, our business.

89
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,917
It's now or never!

90
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,639
Don't be such an idiot.

91
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,919
Get yourself a good job first,
then we'll see.

92
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,994
Where? Today only the Rothschilds
can afford a Maître D.

93
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,397
Remember Maurice Barge?

94
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,039
- Your buddy from the Ritz?
- Right.

95
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,679
Know where he is now?

96
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,148
Buffalo Bill's, being hassled
by a manager his son's age.

97
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,515
No, I'm sorry.

98
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,354
Not after 20 years
serving the top drawer!

99
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,073
Well, I don't know
what the top drawer eat.

100
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,229
And I don't fancy serving fat cats.

101
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,071
You're wrong.

102
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,799
They'll love your cooking.

103
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,918
You could win
a Michelin star in 2 years time.

104
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,795
And the PAYE?

105
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,234
We can't handle that.

106
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,277
The accounts, all that stuff.

107
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,990
When I see poor old Georges,
I'd rather not be a boss.

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,592
How much will all this cost?

109
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,232
All in all, 250 000€
and it's ours.

110
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,908
You're nuts.

111
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,472
No bank will lend us that.

112
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,835
You have 20 000€.

113
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,719
I have 15 000
plus 30 000 severance pay.

114
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,029
Excuse me.

115
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,196
Yes, Mr d'Espinasse?

116
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,472
Absolutely, Mr d'Espinasse.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,672
No problem, Mr d'Espinasse.

118
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,349
Goodbye, Mr d'Espinasse.

119
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,716
- It was Mr d'Espinasse.
- No kidding.

120
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,188
A lunch in his home...

121
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,591
He wants me to serve.
And who's lending us 200 000?

122
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,114
- D'Espinasse?
- Right.

123
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,351
I've spoken to him, he agrees.

124
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,191
For the Berthin-Schwartz Bank
200 000€ is peanuts.

125
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,710
Well?

126
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,790
Boss?

127
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,513
Chef. Not boss!

128
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,636
oK, chef.

129
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,756
Look!

130
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,038
Mao! Down, Mao!

131
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,634
Let him go!

132
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,030
You exaggerate! You know Julien!

133
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,191
You're a monster. A tyrant!

134
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,831
Not the tray!

135
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,798
Run along and play.

136
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,951
He's teasing, he's not nasty.

137
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,989
They broke in while we were asleep.

138
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,391
All the jewellery, the 2 Matisses,
the Vlaminck.

139
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,119
our Boulle furniture...

140
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,078
- There's nothing left.
- My God!

141
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,312
How ghastly!
You must be traumatized.

142
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,677
- It means more shopping.
- Yes.

143
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,078
- They're organizing another sale.
- You must come.

144
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,670
I don't need convincing.

145
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,311
Why have we got
to complain about, Henri?

146
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,313
You've been doubling
our turnover for 5 years.

147
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,596
This year will be even better.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,353
We fired half the workforce,

149
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,670
the others will work double hard.

150
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,515
Remember "Work more to earn more"?

151
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,355
That was never intended
for the same people!

152
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,351
No.

153
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,393
Julien, there you are.

154
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,790
- It's Mao. I'm sorry.
- Again?

155
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,995
Something he ate.

156
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,831
Where?

157
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,116
How should I know? Heavens!

158
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,430
No, I mean where did he...

159
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,599
In the hall by the coats.

160
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,354
Hurry, or there'll be a disaster!

161
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,113
Full house!

162
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,510
Still playing poker?

163
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,750
He's exhausting!

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,989
Here, help me.

165
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,830
- Victoria!
- I'm coming!

166
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,269
Madame!

167
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,550
What's this?

168
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,195
Buzz off!

169
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,998
- Thank you, Julien.
- Thank you, sir.

170
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,038
Don't let Mao out of the garden
when you leave.

171
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,190
Mr d'Espinasse?

172
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,159
Have you considered my proposal?

173
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,069
What proposal?

174
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,551
The restaurant I want to open
with my chef friend.

175
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,148
Ah, yes.

176
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,394
But I won't have you
to do my dinners!

177
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,279
Don't worry,
I'll always be free for you, sir.

178
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,358
It's so hard to find good staff.
And you know the house.

179
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,238
- Thank you, Julien.
- It's nothing, sir.

180
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,357
France needs
more people like you.

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,751
The French grumble
about working too hard.

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,719
The problem isn't having
one job, but two.

183
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,789
Keep me informed.
I'll be your first customer.

184
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,719
- Mr d'Espinasse?
- Yes?

185
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,991
Excuse me...

186
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,717
would your bank agree
to give me a loan?

187
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,955
A loan?

188
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,357
How long have you been working
for us, Julien?

189
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,278
Almost 17 years, sir.

190
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,068
It's incredible.

191
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,392
After 17 years you still don't know
we never give personal loans?

192
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,189
No, but...

193
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,318
I thought there'd be
exceptions for staff...

194
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,471
- Personal staff.
- No, Julien!

195
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,712
That's the thin edge of the wedge.

196
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,918
Bring me a project
to rebuild Les Halles

197
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,799
and we can find a way.
But not a greasy spoon.

198
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,355
Your local bank will help you
at very acceptable interest rates.

199
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,832
But my length of service...

200
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,277
off already?
We've barely seen each other.

201
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,068
Let me see you out.

202
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,110
He took the piss out of you.

203
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,997
He kicked you out
and won't help you start again.

204
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,754
He didn't kick me out.
I have my severance pay.

205
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,718
Yeah, that gold mine.

206
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,999
How much?
30 000 for 17 years service?

207
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,639
Right, it's not peanuts.

208
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,269
It's peanut shells.

209
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,151
oK, back off.

210
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,960
It's d'Espinasse's cigar budget.

211
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,076
He's probably a millionaire.

212
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,877
So what?

213
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,076
We're not in the same line.

214
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,675
Sometimes you sound
like a communist.

215
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,480
Thirty euros isn't a fortune!

216
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,790
I'm expecting a money transfer.

217
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,477
You said that two days ago
but your account is still empty.

218
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,312
I'm sorry, I can't help.

219
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,996
Gentlemen, good morning!

220
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,195
Good morning, sir.

221
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,597
<i>You're too old
to be turned down!</i>

222
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,513
I'm sorry,
your loan has been refused.

223
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,672
Not enough guarantees.

224
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,555
Isn't a restaurant a guarantee?

225
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,631
Not if you go bankrupt.

226
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,190
I hope you don't, but it's a risk.

227
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,798
I based my calculations
on a turnover of... Shit!

228
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,032
What?

229
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,472
Sorry, our computers are down.
Third time this week.

230
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,439
Anyway we have nothing more to say.
Coming?

231
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,035
Wait, you haven't heard
the good news.

232
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,551
This capitol you need:

233
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,030
I can offer you a way
to constitute it.

234
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,789
We have a wide range of safe
high-return credit possibilities.

235
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,190
For instance: Multimoney.

236
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,154
It rose by 2.6% this year.

237
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,552
2.6%?

238
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,273
At a 4% inflation rate?

239
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,319
Very interesting.

240
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,279
We'll be able to open
in 40 years time.

241
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,555
Sounds good.

242
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,588
I'm talking about "safe" profit
but if you're not scared of risks

243
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,637
that changes everything.
Look.

244
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,836
our Asia Tech unit trust,

245
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,718
it's dynamic, it's Asian...

246
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,158
<i>Blue Mineral should shoot up
25% - 30% today,</i>

247
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,470
<i>so we should make about 80 million.</i>

248
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,709
<i>Excellent!</i>

249
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,713
<i>I'll tell my son to buy.
It'll pay for his divorce.</i>

250
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,989
Blue Mineral.

251
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,598
I want to buy Blue Mineral.

252
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,877
Pardon?

253
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,829
You know Blue Mineral,
the manganese?

254
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,278
It's out of the question,

255
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,954
we never intervene
on the Stock Exchange.

256
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,758
However with Multimoney...

257
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,515
Stuff your Multimoney.
I want to buy Blue Mineral.

258
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,749
- I'm sorry...
- No, we're sorry.

259
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,076
Come on, let's go.

260
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,358
We're too old too.

261
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,991
Leave the Stock Exchange
to the professionals.

262
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,708
Madame Morel,

263
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,949
what's happened?

264
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,077
Mum! What are you doing?

265
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,355
Stop it!

266
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,749
It's Mr FoucauIt's door.

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,594
Forgive her.
She's losing it.

268
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,793
Come on, mum.

269
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,909
Sorry.

270
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,555
Mr Foucault?

271
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,349
Gilbert Tomasini from the CPDF Bank,
Rue Legrand.

272
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,555
We have to talk.

273
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,433
Yes, sure.

274
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,072
Fine.

275
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,351
<i>Blue Mineral and Canberra
go sky high. Up 29%.</i>

276
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,915
I'm really sorry.

277
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,913
I made you lose money.
Bad for a bank manager.

278
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,916
29% in one day?

279
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,116
34% since this morning.

280
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,990
Just between us, how did you know?

281
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,312
No!

282
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,588
Don't tell me.
I'd rather not know.

283
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,638
However, if you have any more...

284
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,479
any more hunches.

285
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,716
I'd be honoured
to handle personally

286
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,712
all your transactions.

287
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,395
obviously...

288
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,319
this is just between us.

289
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,509
It's the moment to consolidate
our position.

290
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,911
We'll drop Chimicorp
and go up 10% on Ultramarine.

291
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,434
And Lynch Capital?

292
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,717
<i>No change.</i>

293
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,394
<i>Saintonge says
they expect a bumper year.</i>

294
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,277
<i>Yes, David?</i>

295
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,159
Here's the latest: ALCAo will announce
a rise in their profits.

296
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,070
ALCAo...

297
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,120
<i>Alban, find something
in the Place Vendôme.</i>

298
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,112
<i>For Madame Saint André.</i>

299
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,031
<i>As usual, sir.</i>

300
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,475
Two cancellations next week.

301
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,709
What's wrong?

302
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,188
Nothing.

303
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,513
Two cancellations?

304
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,355
Unbelievable!

305
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,749
No, put half on Lynch Capital.

306
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,276
Right.

307
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,398
And 4000 on ALCo.
It'll shoot up.

308
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,359
Right away.

309
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,035
Fucking amazing!

310
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,036
What's going on?

311
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,512
Just putting a savings plan through.

312
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,955
That's the second this week.

313
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,316
Well done, Gilbert.

314
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,597
20 000€?
Are you putting me on?

315
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,956
No, it's crazy,
I can't get over it.

316
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,509
I'll have most of the money
before I leave.

317
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,115
I want a piece.
I am your partner.

318
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,349
- You can't.
- Why?

319
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,636
- You're a communist.
- Cut it out.

320
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,348
Don't be trapped
by capitalism, Etienne.

321
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,510
It's for a good cause.

322
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,320
I have 15 000€
in a savings account.

323
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,074
You shouldn't do that!

324
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,389
I'm happy to.

325
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,794
She's cute, huh?

326
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,118
Brains too. She works at Georges'
but she's a student.

327
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,236
What did you do to her?

328
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,029
Nothing.
I don't know what she sees in me.

329
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,033
She sees the man of her dreams.

330
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,032
Young, with a great job.

331
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,077
And a Led Zeppelin collection.

332
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,753
Piss off.

333
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,114
But she comes on to me,
it's embarrassing.

334
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,272
If I didn't hold back...

335
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,916
I'm not crazy, though.

336
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,516
The aging Romeo dating a young babe.

337
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,551
No way.

338
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,276
Well, well...

339
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,959
I'm off, Etienne.

340
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,750
Keep quiet about the Stock Exchange.

341
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,831
What do you take me for?

342
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,756
30 000€ in 2 weeks?

343
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,759
Not lrish, are you?

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,797
He's been in the business 15 years.

345
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,875
Serving Vivagel,
Philips, LVMH lunch every day!

346
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,351
The Stock Exchange is rigged.
Give me racing!

347
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,355
You're wrong.

348
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,795
They're both the same.

349
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,315
A simple punter
is screwed every time.

350
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,437
But if you have good tips

351
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,635
you clean up.

352
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,199
Yeah? And the crash?

353
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,396
- What crash?
- The Stock Market crash.

354
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,629
Wake up.

355
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,075
They're jumping
out of windows in New York!

356
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,270
So? You're on the ground floor.

357
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,154
A white Mercedes A-Class
with 78 plates?

358
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,674
That's me.

359
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,388
- Hurry, they're clamping it.
- No!

360
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,199
I'm on my way!

361
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,919
Hello, Mr Foucault.

362
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,673
A strong expresso?

363
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,480
- Later, I'm waiting for someone.
- I see.

364
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,674
No, it's professional.

365
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,599
The bank needs a new maid.

366
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,671
Then I won't dim the lights?

367
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,790
Hello.

368
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,672
You're late.

369
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,838
Yes, I'm sorry.

370
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,199
A glass of champagne.

371
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,509
No, a Bellini!

372
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,434
No, sorry, a kir royal
with blackberry, please.

373
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,594
How shall we do this?
Will you start?

374
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,308
or shall l?

375
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,950
First I need to clarify some points.

376
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,755
- Are you married?
- What?

377
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,236
No, I wouldn't be here if...

378
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,073
Single.

379
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,554
Any children?

380
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,150
No.

381
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,589
Good.

382
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,351
I have nothing against children,
of course,

383
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,194
but they complicate matters:
school, games, etc...

384
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,000
- You are strange.
- I beg your pardon?

385
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,870
Taking notes, asking questions,
like I'm taking an exam.

386
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,828
one strong coffee.

387
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,437
A champagne kir for Madame.

388
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,038
What about you...

389
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,636
What are you looking for
in a woman?

390
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,033
Someone available and motivated
who can buckle down to it.

391
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,318
I'm a stickler for tidiness
and cleanliness.

392
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,431
Pardon?

393
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,673
What else?
Not much ironing,

394
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,590
about half a day a week.

395
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,832
But the table linen
must be properly folded.

396
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,998
This isn't the 19th century.

397
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,310
We have the right to vote now.

398
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,518
I can't see the connection.

399
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,273
It's staggering!

400
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,910
This isn't the way to go about
looking for a soul mate.

401
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,071
A soul mate?

402
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,673
May l?

403
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,275
Aren't you Ulysses?

404
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,117
Ulysses?

405
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,197
No, I'm looking for a maid.

406
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,431
Are you Stéphanie?

407
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,950
Ulysses 45.

408
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,793
I was on time
but they were clamping my Mercedes.

409
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,830
I apologize. Please forgive me.

410
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,789
I'm so sorry.

411
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,872
Sorry.

412
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,633
Let's sit somewhere quieter?

413
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,677
Yes!

414
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,788
What's happened?

415
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,393
Big trouble.

416
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,636
Give me a lift?

417
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,429
Yes.
No, well...

418
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,238
Can't I help you fix it?

419
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,196
Forget it.

420
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,759
I'll do it tomorrow.

421
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,072
But maybe it's something minor...

422
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,037
You don't want to give me a lift!

423
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,913
No, it's not that...
No...

424
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,309
It's out of my way.

425
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,756
oh, yeah?

426
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,428
You know where I live?

427
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,719
No, you're right.

428
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,513
Where do you live?

429
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,711
Do you read Shakespeare?

430
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,596
He's my father's favourite writer.

431
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,637
There's a line of his I adore:

432
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,751
"Love looks not with the eyes
but with the mind."

433
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,032
Yeah. Beautiful.

434
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,675
Like some?

435
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,949
It's good stuff.

436
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,994
I don't believe it.

437
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,639
I don't believe it!

438
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,476
My favourite record!

439
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,030
"Physical Graffiti", Led Zeppelin.

440
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,755
I lent mine to a friend and lost it.

441
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,755
"Kashmir",

442
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,158
"Down by the Seaside",

443
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,519
"Houses of the Holy"...

444
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,872
Here.
Present for you.

445
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,717
You're mad. It's unobtainable.

446
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,428
Exactly.

447
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,358
Anyway no one listens to it.

448
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,351
oK, l...

449
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,670
I accept. Thank you.

450
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,434
I'm really touched.

451
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,269
Good stuff!

452
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,559
Mr Morel, hello.

453
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,592
- Have you seen my mother?
- No.

454
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,114
She's disappeared again.

455
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,112
I don't know what yours is like...

456
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,589
She's dead.

457
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,956
You're lucky.

458
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,237
I mean, some days
you wonder what's best.

459
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,030
Everyone knows her.
They'll bring her back.

460
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,918
But in what state?

461
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,436
Last time the kids painted her face
with magic markers.

462
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,715
They tagged her.

463
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,598
She didn't want me to wash it off.

464
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,274
She talks like them now.
A regular kid.

465
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,637
But my wife and l
have three children already.

466
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,759
Look, Mr Mo...

467
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,310
The solution is a nursing home.

468
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,313
Perfect for her.

469
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,193
We visited one with a lovely garden.

470
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,352
But very expensive.
over 20 000€ a year.

471
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,314
Goodness.

472
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,039
I have 4 000€.

473
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,836
But I can't get a bank loan on that.

474
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,188
There's the Stock Exchange,
of course.

475
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,479
But that's something...

476
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,948
you must know about.

477
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,673
Don't you agree?

478
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,433
otherwise it's very...

479
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,675
I won't bother you any longer.

480
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,713
If you see my mother
can you bring her back?

481
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,995
of course.

482
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,390
Mr Morel...

483
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,832
Can I have a word with you?

484
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,436
What?

485
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,634
Shh, Etienne!

486
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,790
oK.

487
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,350
oK.

488
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,517
oK. I don't have time now.

489
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,677
Me too, big hug.

490
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,555
My father.

491
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,030
He's cool but he's pressurizing me
over these exams.

492
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,918
He's scared I'll flunk the oral.

493
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,156
You're brilliant at the oral.

494
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,313
Very funny.

495
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,039
No, what kind of oral?

496
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,508
School leaving certificate.

497
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,354
That's why I'm quitting
my job next week.

498
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,958
School leaving certificate?

499
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,068
Aren't you very behind?

500
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,435
No, not very.

501
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,793
Not very? But...

502
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,039
How old are you?
You're not under age?

503
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,877
Seriously, you are over 18?

504
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,075
Sure I am.

505
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,474
I will be in october.

506
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,390
It's not true.

507
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,788
It is.

508
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,111
I can't register it officially,

509
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,918
they're not our clients.

510
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,309
Well then...

511
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,470
Put it on my account,
I'll share it out.

512
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,913
No more overdrafts.
All over!

513
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,918
No more overdrafts.

514
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,630
Thank you.

515
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,757
Mr Martinez, our director.

516
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,793
- Mr Foucault.
- Delighted.

517
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,756
I'll leave you.

518
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,194
I'll deal with it.

519
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,592
May I open
a Multimoney security account for you?

520
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,956
Are you kidding?
It's worth peanuts.

521
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,760
I know! It's to reassure my boss.

522
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,151
He's seen you here a lot,
to allay his suspicions.

523
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,356
Don't worry, minimum 100€.

524
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,830
And the bank charges are for me.

525
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,751
Thank you.

526
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,070
That must be the client adviser!

527
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,516
Stop it. He's your son-in-law.

528
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,630
Holy shit!

529
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,514
He's bought the Volvo.

530
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,754
Be nice for once.

531
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,876
Smile!

532
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,912
Your husband is transformed.

533
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,672
He's scintillating. I'm worried.

534
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,114
So I see.

535
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,909
That's enough!

536
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,957
Wash your hands! Lunchtime!

537
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,710
And don't run.
Slowly.

538
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,118
You seem very edgy.

539
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,237
- You should be happy.
- Look...

540
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,072
We eat at the Tour d'Argent,
he gave me this ring,

541
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,839
and the car,

542
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,399
he wants us to visit Brazil

543
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,108
with the children.

544
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,314
You find that normal?

545
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,792
Last month
we couldn't pay the nanny.

546
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,152
Maybe he's been promoted.
It's great.

547
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,392
I hope he isn't being silly.

548
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,119
Come on!

549
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,153
Hey! You have a terrific car!

550
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,478
Have you robbed your bank
or something?

551
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,835
No, I have some clients,
personal clients,

552
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,798
I handle their portfolios...

553
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,075
Excuse me.

554
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,396
Mr Foucault! How are you?

555
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,835
No, nothing serious,
on the contrary.

556
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,595
Just to inform you
that EFELECT is up 21%!

557
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,875
21 points in a week.

558
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,550
Absolutely.

559
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,316
of course, don't hesitate,
Mr Foucault.

560
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,231
Goodbye.

561
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,355
Excuse me.

562
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,878
I'm very impressed, Gilbert my boy.

563
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,958
I try to be reactive.

564
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,919
The market
is fairly bullish right now,

565
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,355
it's tough, but I'm not complaining.

566
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,595
You know,

567
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,194
I have some money
sleeping in an account...

568
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,396
in Switzerland.

569
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,237
obviously

570
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,033
this money doesn't exist,
you understand?

571
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,429
We're used to that.

572
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,590
You too?

573
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,789
So if a good opportunity arises,

574
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,712
Iet me know, eh?

575
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,791
Making your money work
is better than working!

576
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,393
Lunchtime!

577
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,473
Finish dressing!

578
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,994
I'm ready. Let's go.

579
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,276
We're early. How about a coffee?

580
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,476
- In the bar.
- Sweetie?

581
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,589
Not saying goodbye?

582
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,754
Yes, of course.
Sorry, baby.

583
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,391
Harmony... Julien.

584
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,516
Hiya.

585
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,030
Mademoiselle.

586
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,435
Go back to bed.

587
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,870
I must run.

588
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,990
"Sweetie"?

589
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,273
I tried to resist, really I did.

590
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,839
But what can you do?

591
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,469
She doesn't like boys.
Boys her age.

592
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,551
She prefers boys your age?

593
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,789
I'm in love.

594
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,955
She makes me want to move on.

595
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,792
It hasn't happened for years.

596
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,597
You grab anything you can get.

597
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,232
As far as that's concerned

598
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,679
you've got it solved.

599
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,468
What do you mean?

600
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,596
C'mon, Julien!

601
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,556
Your last girl friend
was 18 months ago.

602
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,236
She lasted 2 weeks as she left
her toothbrush at your place.

603
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,833
It wasn't that!

604
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,196
I didn't have time for her
with my job.

605
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,795
With Mr d'Espinasse:
"Fine, Mr d'Espinasse..."

606
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,029
oh, back off!

607
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,792
What is your life today?

608
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,508
Your job, your TV, your apartment?

609
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,677
Lucky you're fucked by your boss!

610
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,637
If you'd like to sign
the sales agreement.

611
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,993
I must ask you
for a cheque for 15 782€.

612
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,353
The seller has refused
suspensive conditions.

613
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,195
If your loan is turned down,
your advance is non-returnable.

614
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,908
No problem.
Where does the 15 000€ go?

615
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,675
Invested at 2%.

616
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,519
What a waste! We have...

617
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,113
Where? Here?

618
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,349
Hello.

619
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,999
Remember me?

620
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,952
That vile man in the café?

621
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,033
Yes, of course.
Sorry...

622
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,317
Avoiding me?

623
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,119
Me? Not at all.

624
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,193
So you read Turkish?

625
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,872
I must have seemed
rather an oaf.

626
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,197
An oaf?
Do people still say that?

627
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,869
Macho then.

628
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,032
Heavy?

629
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,590
- Did you find your cleaning lady?
- Yes.

630
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,119
And your Ulysses 42?

631
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,395
45!

632
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,517
More like 54 frankly, but...

633
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,749
I shouldn't have gone
on that date...

634
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,673
A friend met the ideal man
on match.com.

635
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,399
She pushed me into it.

636
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,470
It's ridiculous.

637
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,278
He's no longer available.

638
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,032
Who?

639
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,635
The ideal man.

640
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,959
He's with your friend!

641
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,430
Well, goodbye.

642
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,393
You don't want it?

643
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,631
Mademoiselle...

644
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,078
I thought perhaps...

645
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,073
I could ask you out
so you'd forgive me.

646
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,196
You're forgiven.

647
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,357
I am?

648
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,752
But you can still ask me out.

649
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,078
Do you like banking, my boy?

650
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,231
Yes, very much.

651
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,033
It's most rewarding...

652
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,357
on a personal level, I mean.

653
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,715
Naturally. on a personal level.

654
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,752
BANK PARKlNG SPACE

655
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,192
I'm HUNGRY!

656
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,792
Lunchtime already?

657
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,438

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,513
and a Domaine de Chevalier
'96 or '95, I never remember.

663
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,512
- '95, sir.
- of course.

664
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,476
What would we do without you?

665
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,872
What guarantee do I have

666
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,759
that my company won't be carved up?

667
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,355
It's not in our interest, sir.

668
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,068
And it goes against our principles.

669
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,751
You'll keep the workforce on?

670
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,592
Never fear, Mr Lebrun.

671
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,879
Your team is as precious to us
as the spirit of your company.

672
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,715
You see, this company is my life.

673
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,030
I started off with one secondhand truck.
Now I have 800.

674
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,115
Just the two of us.
My wife handled accounts and clients,

675
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,670
I was on the road day and night,
summer and winter.

676
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,152
When Claudia was born

677
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,153
I had to borrow from the bank
to buy a pram!

678
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,159
How very touching.

679
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,392
But I have no heir.

680
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,315
I have my three girls
but trucks don't interest them.

681
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,710
And my son-in-law makes films.

682
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,750
With my money, of course.

683
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,915
He's been preparing his film
for 5 years.

684
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,434
Artists!

685
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,389
I have a son who wants to be a DJ!

686
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,359
Excellent.

687
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,439
Anyway I'm dealing with the top,
aren't l?

688
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,953
No question about it.

689
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,311
<i>The affair is shaping up well.</i>

690
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,837
<i>And the planning permission?</i>

691
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,036
They vote at the beginning of June.

692
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,078
our friends on the board
guarantee a yes.

693
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,274
The opposition will get a nibble.

694
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,273
And the redundancies?
1300 laid off.

695
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,750
The unions will give us hell.

696
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,832
Lebrun will take the rap.

697
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,756
<i>They'll say he sold
without enough guarantees.</i>

698
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,436
We're just doing our job.

699
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,393
But nothing must leak out
before he signs.

700
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,433
What's your impression?

701
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,117
He needs to sell.

702
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,037
Apparently his health problems
are worse than he says.

703
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,071
<i>Yes?</i>

704
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,639
It's Julien, Julien Foucault.

705
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,676
<i>Just a minute.</i>

706
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,388
I booked a table for 9 o'clock.

707
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,470
Collar's better open...

708
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:18,917
Hello!

709
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,156
Hey!

710
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,549
Can you come up?
There's a disaster,

711
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,030
it's my washing machine.
Do you mind?

712
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,190
No.

713
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,714
It's over here.

714
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,479
It's nothing, just a small leak.

715
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,676
I'll fix it.

716
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,672
Where's the stopcock?

717
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,796
The stopcock?

718
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,390
- To stop the water.
- oh, yes!

719
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,239
- Found it?
- Yes!

720
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,959
Good. Turn it off.

721
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,237
- What?
- The other way!

722
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,550
It's the wrong way!

723
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,109
- What?
- It's the wrong way!

724
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,875
That's it.

725
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,990
- It was the wrong way.
- I'm so sorry.

726
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,310
- It's nothing.
- I'm sorry.

727
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,949
It's my jacket, it's drenched.

728
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,953
So is your shirt.

729
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,118
That doesn't matter.
Do you have a hairdryer?

730
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,869
I'm so sorry!

731
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,396
You'll find me old fashioned,

732
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,552
but I don't see why
someone as attractive as you

733
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,597
needs to go on lnternet to...

734
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,035
Absolutely.

735
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,670
- What?
- You are old fashioned.

736
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,878
You want to know
why I go on lnternet?

737
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,351
Because your friend
found the ideal man that way.

738
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,593
I wouldn't like a computer
to find my ideal woman.

739
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,159
Why not?

740
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,440
People are incredibly fussy about...

741
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,119
choosing a new car,

742
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,793
the engine power,
the colour of the seats.

743
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,669
But they leave their love life
to fate.

744
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,756
Fate always brings me the same type.

745
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,149
What type?

746
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,628
The type who...

747
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,833
rather obsessive loners

748
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,072
who feel threatened
by a second toothbrush.

749
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,069
Here, let me.

750
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,239
- I've scared you off?
- Not at all.

751
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,517
I'll see if your suit is dry.

752
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,512
Sorry, I don't know
what came over me.

753
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,109
Was that all?

754
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,873
What do you mean, all?

755
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,679
Didn't you...

756
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,594
- Not even pissed?
- No!

757
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,952
I think he tried to kiss me
but I turned away.

758
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,076
Why did l?

759
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,352
You don't kiss on a first date.

760
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,672
It's normal, you're 36.

761
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,317
His eyes are very gentle, a bit sad.

762
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,069
He's gorgeous.

763
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,197
<i>As gorgeous as an ltalian</i>

764
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,477
<i>Knowing he'll have love and wine</i>

765
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,871
He only had wine.

766
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,510
Good. You took Auntie's advice,
I'm proud of you.

767
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,155
No, I said
I wanted to fall in love...

768
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,437
I was ready for something serious...

769
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,590
oh, right.

770
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,400
What? You think I freaked him out?

771
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,837
No, he's probably the type

772
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,878
who's not used to rejection.
He'll call you.

773
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,275
You think so?

774
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,712
Not a good idea.
She's sweet but...

775
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,516
she wants it all.
True love, commitment,

776
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,557
that's not for me.

777
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,314
Anyway,
I can't get involved right now.

778
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,119
No, you might be happy.

779
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,156
Stop doing those onions.

780
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,035
Hand me a truffle from the jar.

781
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,112
That fat truffle.

782
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,669
I'm not butting in?

783
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,353
We were just talking about you.

784
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,998
What's this:
"Filet of beef in fresh thyme

785
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,958
"on a bed of baby cardoons

786
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,760
"with bone marrow cromesqui

787
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,070
"en papillotte"?

788
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,594
The dish of the day.

789
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,196
My customers
have 45 minutes for lunch.

790
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,318
They may have time to read it
but not to eat.

791
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,909
Shit! First Picasso, now Proust!

792
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,752
I'm getting overcooked.

793
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,552
Drink my health.

794
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,155
- How kind. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

795
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,238
- I appreciate it.
- No, I do!

796
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,594
That tip-off
about the Bouygues deal!

797
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,989
No one saw it coming.

798
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,310
What Bouygues deal?

799
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,199
It was on the radio this morning.

800
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,919
We all cracked up

801
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,912
as Etienne had told us about it.

802
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,148
So what do we do?
Stay in the game

803
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,352
or pull out our winnings?

804
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,839
Brand new.

805
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,593
Straight from Geneva.

806
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,633
We can't stop grateful patients
thanking us!

807
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,995
Naturally!

808
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,471
- How much is there?
- 200 000.

809
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,671
I can have more.

810
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,797
No, no, that's fine.

811
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,308
To start with...

812
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,997
Antoine, I'm very touched
by your trust in me...

813
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,308
Doctor, you must come!

814
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,549
I'm in a meeting!

815
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,395
It's the trephination in room 108.

816
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,270
I'm coming.

817
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,275
Do your best.

818
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,239
You won't be disappointed.

819
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,679
- Where is he?
- Room 108!

820
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,039
Etienne sounds a bit dated, no?

821
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,874
Those old fashioned names
are trendy now.

822
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,635
What do his parents do?

823
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,509
You know Harmony,
the slightest question

824
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,830
and she treats us like torturers!

825
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,795
All I know is he dropped out of Uni

826
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,837
and wants to open a restaurant.

827
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,514
Perfect!
The year of her exams!

828
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,399
- Don't start.
- She's punishing us.

829
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,868
Chill out!

830
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,190
We've always encouraged trust.

831
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,397
And we've never regretted it.

832
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,519
I'd far rather Harmony told us
about her crushes.

833
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,513
Not like the time we found
some hash under her pillow.

834
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,875
<i>Take the first exit
at the roundabout.</i>

835
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,996
Hash!

836
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,753
<i>Turn back...</i>

837
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,593
Shit! Shit!

838
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,309
Yes?

839
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,154
Do come in.

840
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,879
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

841
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,679
Something smells good!

842
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,310
- olivier. Harmony's father.
- Hello.

843
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,835
- My wife Marianne.
- Hello. Here.

844
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,150
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

845
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,837
- Can I take your coat?
- Thanks.

846
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,240
Harmony's popped out
to buy some bread.

847
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,838
Do sit down.

848
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,636
So your son is the next Ducasse?

849
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,596
My son?

850
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,752
Isn't he cooking tonight?

851
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,594
- No, I am.
- Runs in the family, eh!

852
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,838
Where is the wonder boy?

853
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,789
Here.

854
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,189
I mean...

855
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,954
I'm Etienne.
Your daughter's boyfriend.

856
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,390
It certainly does smell good!

857
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,389
A drink? A glass of white wine?

858
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,193
He's talking to you.

859
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,879
Call me Etienne.

860
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,030
What?

861
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,508
What will you have?

862
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,149
- Nothing.
- A glass of white wine?

863
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,197
I'll have a scotch.

864
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,710
Neat!

865
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,550
Hiya!

866
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,795
So you've all met?

867
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,750
- You could have warned us.
- Pardon?

868
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,592
Warned you about what?

869
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,432
Like a drink, baby?

870
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,679
No, I'll sip from your glass.

871
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,355
olivier, just a drop to toast with?

872
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,633
No, it's fine.

873
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,633
Health and happiness!

874
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,148
Excuse me, sir, but...

875
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,109
How old are you?

876
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,754
- Dad!
- It's fine, baby.

877
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,838
I know it's surprising,
I was surprised myself at first.

878
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,758
I'm forty five.

879
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,638
Well, forty eight to be exact.

880
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,838
only five years older than you,
not a lot.

881
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,473
What are you saying?

882
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,036
Boys my age
have never interested me.

883
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,396
Your mental age is what counts.

884
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,754
I can see there's no problem there.

885
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,116
That's vile,
you don't even know him.

886
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,750
If he was Pablo Casals or Picasso
I'd understand,

887
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,639
but a pizza cook...

888
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,159
How about some dinner?

889
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,393
- Already?
- Yes.

890
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,553
If you like.

891
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,598
What's that?

892
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,553
It's my record!

893
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,998
My Led Zepp!
He nicked my Led Zeppelin!

894
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,639
No, Harmony gave it to me.

895
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,155
Back off, you never listen to it!

896
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,472
Get your things, we're going.

897
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,915
What? No way!

898
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,679
Hurry or I'll smack you.

899
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,797
Violence is never a solution.

900
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,430
Fuck off! She's my daughter!

901
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,238
Have you gone insane?

902
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,040
Insane?
She's only doing it to upset us.

903
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,597
I see why your pupils hate you.

904
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,074
Do you now?

905
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,949
Right!

906
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,429
Come on, let's go.

907
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,953
Please, olivier, don't go.

908
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,989
Darling, please...

909
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,559
No. I'm out of the madhouse!

910
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,155
Marianne!

911
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,390
Well done, you won!

912
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,552
We've found something.

913
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,837
It's small but Maxime
will have his own room.

914
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,399
Wonderful!

915
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,354
This is for you.

916
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,914
For me?

917
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,790
It's fantastic! Very good.

918
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,275
Thank you.

919
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,754
Mr Foucault, do you mind
if I recuperate my money?

920
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,713
No problem.
I'll have it ready tomorrow.

921
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,152
Thank you, you've saved our lives.

922
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,314
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

923
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,030
Calf's sweetbreads, on the house.

924
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,872
- No, what for?
- It's normal.

925
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,998
LVMH was delicious.
My wife and I loved it.

926
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,188
I see. Thank you.

927
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,759
We thank you, Mr Foucault.

928
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,073
Apparently FED interest rates
have gone up.

929
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,949
- Is that good for us?
- I don't know.

930
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,276
I'd say LVMH in first place,

931
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,959
KKS second,

932
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,073
Bouygues in third.

933
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,595
Watch out for KKS.
The dollar's high.

934
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,559
What did Gaillard say about Vivagel?

935
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,914
Something about Areva,
I can't remember.

936
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,151
Me neither.
Stay on track, guys!

937
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,877
Bye.

938
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,549
Are you off, baby?

939
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,234
I'm studying at Quentin's.
I told you.

940
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,038
No, you didn't.

941
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,153
Is that him?

942
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,515
Why not my place?

943
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,238
It's too small. We'll disturb you
if you want to watch TV.

944
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,798
No, you won't. I'll cook for you,
gnoccchi in a lemon cream sauce.

945
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,473
Sure, sweetie,
but not tonight.

946
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,033
And you don't even have Wi-fi.

947
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,510
Right, as you like.

948
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,715
I didn't imagine him like that.
Trendy, huh?

949
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,234
Don't freak out.

950
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,628
- You know boys don't...
- He's no boy.

951
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,390
- He's 21.
- You see?

952
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,468
See you. Bye!

953
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,112
Don't wait up, we'll work late.

954
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,714
Sure.

955
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,588
He won't have to get up
to take her to school!

956
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,158
Japanese, what's more.

957
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,431
Hey, "Ratatouille",
bring us some pear tart

958
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,398
without the choucroute!

959
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,630
I quit.

960
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,996
You're kidding! It's a gold mine.

961
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,710
It's too risky.
The whole neighbourhood knows about it.

962
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,313
It's insider trading.

963
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,913
Insider trading?

964
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,355
It's what your bankers do!

965
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,556
Yes, but it's their job.

966
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,275
Don't worry, we've made enough
to pay the estate agent tomorrow.

967
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,478
And you know what that is?
Freedom, Etienne!

968
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,479
Freedom, yeah...

969
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,314
Freedom to work our asses off
till we drop.

970
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,869
I thought it was your life's dream?

971
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,795
We're not robbers.
We're making the money work for us.

972
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,152
Work for us!
You still believe that crap?

973
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,311
Money doesn't work!

974
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,391
Every banknote was sweated for!

975
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,789
By you or someone else.

976
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,359
It's not magic.

977
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,676
one last time.

978
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,999
You've changed.

979
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,912
All fine. No problem
with the planning permission.

980
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,195
And Lebrun?

981
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,910
He trusts us. But we can't act
before buying him out.

982
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,669
<i>We have a signature date: the 18th.</i>

983
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,269
Excellent.

984
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,549
There's an echo.

985
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,754
Yes, sir?

986
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,111
Bring us some brandy, Julien.

987
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,588
Very good, sir.

988
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,672
Two? That's ludicrous!

989
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,437
Yes, actually.

990
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,078
Absolutely, my dear fellow,
many thanks.

991
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,556
Big botch up at BMGM.

992
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,031
The supervisory board found
clumsily falsified minutes.

993
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,840
Gaspard's been caught
with his hand in the till.

994
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,035
Again?

995
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,508
For how much?

996
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,159
Two billion. For the moment.

997
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,908
Poor old Gaspard!

998
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,357
He doesn't care.
He'll return to the revenue court.

999
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,359
Anyway his wife has a fortune.

1000
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,910
Alban, dispose of our holdings.
Discreetly.

1001
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,920
We have 3 or 4 days
before this erupts.

1002
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,155
What the hell's he up to?

1003
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,595
Julien?

1004
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,431
<i>How do we stand with BMGM?</i>

1005
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,309
<i>We don't have much,
but there'll be a huge scandal...</i>

1006
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,399
<i>Damn fool Gaspard.</i>

1007
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,790
<i>Nabbed like a greenhorn.</i>

1008
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,270
<i>For how much this time?</i>

1009
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,158
<i>You mean his fine?</i>

1010
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,710
<i>No, his departure package, Alban!
His golden parachute.</i>

1011
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,272
<i>More like a golden hot-air balloon!</i>

1012
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,988
"Morel: Blue Mineral + 14 000.

1013
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,989
"EFELECT : Mr Denissovitch + 10 500.

1014
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,629
"Etienne: + 30 000..."

1015
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,355
If the flunkeys start
mopping up the sauce...

1016
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,479
Who can one trust?

1017
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,837
As he's leaving,
I suggest a farewell gift.

1018
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,832
It's the last one,
I've made a note of it.

1019
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,518
Wonderful how Julien makes a note
of everything.

1020
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,633
<i>It's still off the record,</i>

1021
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,599
but BMGM
is going to rocket sky high!

1022
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,880
<i>Shares will be snapped up.
We mustn't miss the bus.</i>

1023
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,315
BMGM double whammy!

1024
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,277
They're beside themselves.
BMGM is massive.

1025
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,800
Holy shit! We'll fuck 'em!

1026
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,029
<i>What?</i>

1027
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,556
Sorry, I was carried away.
I'll see to it right now.

1028
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,237
Hello, Stéphanie?

1029
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,835
It's Julien, Julien Foucault.

1030
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,876
I say, Gilbert,

1031
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,199
there must be a mistake.

1032
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,391
I'm not on the new org chart.

1033
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,198
Really? Let's see.

1034
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,434
They've moved you.

1035
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,752
Without asking me?
Where will they put me?

1036
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,594
I don't know.

1037
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,833
I can't see you anywhere.

1038
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,308
What is this?

1039
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,274
It's ridiculous.

1040
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,548
I've been in this branch
for 25 years.

1041
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,957
They can't treat people like that.

1042
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,789
I'm fifty seven.

1043
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,753
What will become of me?

1044
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,350
Mr Martinez.

1045
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,159
I'm terribly sorry.

1046
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,633
Thank you, Gilbert.

1047
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,590
I misjudged you.

1048
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,879
You're a good man.

1049
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,909
Excuse me, an emergency.

1050
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,992
No! I expected your call.

1051
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,396
Well?

1052
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,270
I'm onto something big. It's huge.

1053
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,869
Terrific!

1054
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,235
Scalpel.

1055

<i>I suggest we mobilize our capital,
maybe half...</i>

1056
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,794
No, all the way!

1057
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,471
- What are you doing?
- You said all the way.

1058
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,630
I wasn't talking to you!

1059
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,318
He'll sleep forever!

1060
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,353
Don't just stand there.

1061
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,318
Get on with it.

1062
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,557
Sorry, Gilbert,
I'm single handed here.

1063
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,598
I can invest half today
and wait for the market reaction?

1064
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,991
I don't know. You hack it.

1065
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,595
Not you, idiot!

1066
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,159
What's wrong with you all?

1067
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,675
Want to kill me?

1068
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,310
Sorry, Gilbert,
there's a massacre going on.

1069
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,314
Didn't you like it?

1070
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,079
It was alright.

1071
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,510
Alright? It's a masterpiece!

1072
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,752
Don't exaggerate.

1073
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,749
- It's a bit silly.
- Silly?

1074
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,594
out of his mind!

1075
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,398
It's a wonderful story.

1076
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,835
He doesn't just say he loves her,
he proves it to her.

1077
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,590
Is camping outside her house
for 3 days a proof of love?

1078
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,910
I'd say it's a proof of weakness.

1079
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,431
You're so prejudiced!

1080
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,079
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

1081
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,390
<i>Next time we'll see Predator 6.</i>

1082
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,916
And you say I'm prejudiced!

1083
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,159
No, I'm kidding.

1084
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,913
Well, I must be off.

1085
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,151
- Have I upset you?
- Not at all.

1086
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,833
But I get up early.

1087
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,919
Kiss me.

1088
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,635
Come on.

1089
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,591
<i>Harmony. Message.</i>

1090
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:33,149
First, why have a cell phone
if it's always switched off?

1091
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,718
I called your friend Florence,

1092
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,791
you must have got the days wrong.

1093

She says
you're revising together tomorrow.

1094
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,109
You can do what you like, of course,

1095
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,512
but you could have let me know.

1096
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,518
How old are you?

1097
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,953

Yes, I have 30 seconds.

- I'll get him.

01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,076
Appalling, no?

1150
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,872
So you knew... and you...

1151
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,476
Set you up?

1152
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,119
But you set us up.
You betrayed our trust.

1153
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,436
Did you think we were blind?

1154
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,830
or should I say deaf?

1155
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,194
It's not an excuse,
but I didn't harm anyone.

1156
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,589
You're right, my boy.

1157
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,192
It's not an excuse.

1158
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,392
Do you have a passion in life?

1159
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,038
Apart from the Stock Market.

1160
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,271
Because from now on

1161
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,273
you can devote yourself to it
full time.

1162
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,429
Get out of here.

1163
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,272
You're lucky we won't press charges.

1164
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,110
- Press charges?
- We could easily.

1165
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,399
- Spying.
- Spreading false information.

1166
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,911
Illegal banking practices.

1167
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,713
Insider trading?

1168
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,760
Price rigging?
All the daily activities

1169
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,032
that line your pockets?

1170
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,271
Enough!
I don't want to see you again.

1171
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,158
You sullied the bank's honour.

1172
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,795
The bank's honour?

1173
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,590
open the window, it stinks in here.

1174
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,593
I thought I'd slipped up,

1175
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,877
but they manipulated me.
I was set up.

1176
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,430
What are you saying?
What is this crap?

1177
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,752
- I'm saying we...
- No! Not "we".

1178
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,073
"You". You fucked up!

1179
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,837
I'm a chef, not a banker.
It's nothing to do with me.

1180
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,239
What's happened to you?

1181
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,030
I was cool working for Georges.

1182
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,918
I've lost everything now.

1183
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,233
You wanted to keep going.
I wanted to stop...

1184
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,516
So I'm to blame?

1185
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,957
I wouldn't have done it
if I'd known it was risky!

1186
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,150
- So that's how you take it?
- How else?

1187
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,109
I've scrimped and saved for years,
you've lost it all.

1188
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,073
Expect me to hug you?

1189
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,195
No.

1190
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,797
Just to act like a friend.

1191
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,160
Mr Foucault! Come in for a minute?

1192
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,676
- Not now, Mr Morel.
- only a minute, it's important.

1193
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,388
- You're pale. Are you alright?
- Look...

1194
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,879
Mr Foucault!

1195
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,069
Give it to Mr Foucault.

1196
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,433
- For me?
- Yes.

1197
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,992
It's from us all.

1198
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,915
- No, I can't...
- Yes!

1199
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,717
After all you've done for us.

1200
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,678
You've changed our lives!

1201
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,393
I'm taking the kids
to Corsica this summer.

1202
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,790
our first holiday for 4 years!
Thank you!

1203
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,712
For Mr Foucault:
Hip, hip...

1204
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,756
My round! Let's drink to this!

1205
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,917
Mr Foucault! Drink up!

1206
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,152
Let's start, he may show up.

1207
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,114
No, he's not coming.

1208
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,351
You may be upsetting yourself
for nothing.

1209
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,394
It's a shame. I really liked him.

1210
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,316
Mr Foucault, what's the time?

1211
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,628
Come over,
the decorating is nearly done.

1212
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,678
Looks good!

1213
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,470
Thank you.

1214
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,836
Here.

1215
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,511
Maybe you have it already?

1216
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,156
<i>A man called Jesus</i>

1217
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,469
No, I haven't read it.

1218
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,358
It's a very good book.

1219
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,396
Yes?

1220
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,232
Thanks.

1221
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,789
Mr Foucault,

1222
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,268
about my money...

1223
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,071
Mr Denissovitch,
there's a little problem...

1224
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,198
Never mind.
It can wait till tomorrow.

1225
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,193
- Come on. What do we say?
- Goodbye.

1226
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,630
Is that your mother?

1227
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,952
Yes.
Mum! Come here!

1228
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,714
Now stop. Stop the ironing a bit.

1229
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,748
She never stops.

1230
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,151
Gaëtan, give granny a drink.

1231
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,197
She's already had three, dad!

1232
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,749
So?
She's been off the road for years!

1233
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,671
I thought you'd put her
in a nursing home?

1234
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,559
Yes, but the apartment
cost us a lot...

1235
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,869
It wasn't that.

1236
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,634
We didn't have the heart
to leave her there.

1237
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,278
She's happy with her new TV.

1238
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,351
Eh, mum?
The flat screen!

1239
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,431
Shut your trap!

1240
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,395
Can I come in?

1241
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,591
I acted like a shit.

1242
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,955
No, you're like everyone else.

1243
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,311
I don't know what got into me.

1244
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,671
I completely lost it.

1245
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,878
Harmony had just dumped me.

1246
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,471
Yes, I know,

1247
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,517
it was on the cards but...

1248
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,310
Shit!

1249
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,799
I never thought
it would hurt so much.

1250
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,795
Poor old Etienne.

1251
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,196
Yes,

1252
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,593
that sums it up.

1253
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,638
They took me for a ride.

1254
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,434
They found out and they set me up.

1255
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,748
They're bastards.

1256
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,678
And all those poor people
who think I'm their saviour.

1257
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,910
The restaurant deal is tomorrow.

1258
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,276
It was never meant for us.

1259
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,795
Eternal losers, huh?

1260
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,032
Is it the 17th today?

1261
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,951
Yes.

1262
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,992
So tomorrow is the 18th?

1263
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,989
Yes. And the day after is the 19th.

1264
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,471
We may have a card to play.

1265
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,635
I'm listening.

1266
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,234
Tomorrow morning,
Berthin-Schwartz Bank

1267
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,438
are buying a truck company,
Lebrun Transports.

1268
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,238
Big deal. So what?

1269
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,036
We can stop them.

1270
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,750
No kidding!
I don't give a shit.

1271
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,719
My wife's leaving me,
her dad's had a heart attack,

1272
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,951
the cops are onto me.

1273
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,873
Your fucking bank
can buy the Eiffel Tower!

1274
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,031
Now gentlemen, if you don't mind...

1275
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,315
Hold it.

1276
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,596
Go on.

1277
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,632
To carry off the deal,

1278
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,309
the bank needs 95% of the shares.

1279
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,996
So they can eliminate
any tricky small shareholders.

1280
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,118
But with under 95%,
they'll have to negotiate.

1281
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,831
And we'll raise the stakes.

1282
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,390
Get it?

1283
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,431
Yes.

1284
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,069
No.

1285
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:37,991
Imagine this:

1286
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:42,472
a property developer wants to buy
a group of plots to build on.

1287
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,638
But he can't buy one tiny plot.

1288
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,192
The owner raises the price.
What can he do?

1289
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,793
It's a nightmare.

1290
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,152
He has to buy it, at any price.
Right?

1291
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,994
otherwise everything
he's bought is worthless.

1292
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,639
I see. It's blackmail.

1293
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,474
If you like.

1294
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,315
But the bankers who do it
dine at the Grand Véfour.

1295
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,279
You want to buy
5% of Lebrun Transports?

1296
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,556
No, 5.1% to be exact.

1297
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,950
5.1% by...

1298
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,875
That's 40 800 shares at 75€.

1299
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,270
It'll cost you 3 million euros.

1300
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,669
Three million sixty thousand.

1301
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,717
Three million euros?

1302
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,155
Can I ask you something,
just curious?

1303
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,072
Where will you find the money?

1304
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,868
In your bank.

1305
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,509
Sure.

1306
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,398
Excuse me, I'm going to vomit.

1307
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,794
Is that your plan?

1308
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,076
We only need it for a few hours.

1309
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,548
Who do you think I am?

1310
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,316
Think I can just press a buzzer
and get you 3 million euros?

1311
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,318
Not one buzzer.

1312
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,198
Lots of buzzers.

1313
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,396
Vincent Lambert. Borealis Life:
92 000, transferred.

1314
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,916
Borealis Life: 92 000, transferred.

1315
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,071
If we fuck up,
I can forget my pension.

1316
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,278
If we pull it off
you can forget your pension too.

1317
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,114
Savings account: 63 761...

1318
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,113
63 000. Transferred.

1319
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,393
63 000. Transferred.

1320
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,834
Here's a big one!

1321
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,149
Pierre Leyssieux.

1322
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,710
Securities account: 175 253€.

1323
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,635
The lot: savings plan,
current account, life insurance...

1324
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,952
Pierre Leyssieux: 175 253,

1325
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,918
175 000. Transferred.

1326
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,479
Jim Jarvis...

1327
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,558
2 900...

1328
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,236
No, 29 000, sorry, transferred...

1329
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,149
Right.

1330
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,238
Xavier Navarre...

1331
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,317
6 542...

1332
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,074
6 000...

1333
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,076
Transferred.

1334
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,515
Shit!

1335
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,350
What are you doing? Get up!

1336
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,116
Am I late?

1337
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,715
No, I'm very early.

1338
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,188
Clients already?

1339
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,157
Clients?

1340
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,073
Yes! They're early
so we won't be disturbed.

1341
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,390
Very important clients.

1342
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,629
I understand.

1343
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,070
By the way,

1344
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,594
our computers are down.

1345
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,755
Another virus.

1346
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,879
It's not true!

1347
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,395
I'll call maintenance.

1348
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,712
No! Don't! I have already.
They're on their way.

1349
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,359
- Mr Tomasini?
- Yes?

1350
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,271
Your tie!

1351
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:09,990
Did she swallow it?

1352
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,152
We have such crap computers,
they crash all the time.

1353
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,879
Not today, I hope.

1354
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,317
Ready?
I hope you don't have weak hearts.

1355
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,119
Nice one!

1356
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,879
Now the stocks.

1357
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,795
I wonder how Lebrun will take
the south zone development plan.

1358
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,599
Is his area as big as that?

1359
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,876
All those trucks need space.

1360
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,953
Plus the warehouses,
the workshops...

1361
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,838
It's a great opportunity.

1362
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,715
A problem, sir.
Unexpected stock movement.

1363
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,036
What did you say?

1364
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:56,757
How much?

1365
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,234
We're still calculating it:
about 6%.

1366
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,431
For you, sir.
It seems important.

1367
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,471
Move, Alban!
Find out about it.

1368
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,035
Mr d'Espinasse?

1369
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,515
Hold on.

1370
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,874
It's out in the open.

1371
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,031
We can meet if you like,
but I haven't much time.

1372
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,556
Very well.

1373
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,197
It's odd. I know that voice.

1374
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:38,872
Well?

1375
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,759
5.1% precisely, sir.

1376
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,276
In 3 hours time
the alarm will warn head office,

1377
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,396
maintenance will arrive,

1378
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:56,077
I'll have 4000 Lebrun shares
and 150 clients demanding their money!

1379
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,639
We only have till 13.00.

1380
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,839
No, till 12.00. I need an hour
to repatriate the money.

1381
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,513
And if they want a delay?

1382
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,315
Why should they?

1383
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:12,869
But...

1384
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,271
What's the time?

1385
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,272
10 o'clock.

1386
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,839
No, 10.01.

1387
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,352
Call me at 11.30, right?

1388
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,750
Me? What shall I say?

1389
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,877
Nothing. I'll do the talking.

1390
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:27,671
oK?

1391
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,711
Let's go!

1392
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:41,751
Right. 11.30?

1393
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,675
on the dot.

1394
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:03,750
Him...

1395
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,469
How did he raise all that money?

1396
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,109
His racket may have gone on
for years.

1397
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,995
Who knows how much he's made?

1398
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,879
Then he must know everything
about our...

1399
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,069
our activities.

1400
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,515
Let him sweat it out.

1401
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,351
We must look into this more closely.

1402
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,118
Nice to see you, Mr Julien.

1403
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,634
Thank you, Jérôme.

1404
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,078
- Are you coming back?
- No.

1405
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,589
I have other plans.

1406
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,549
Has my money transfer come through?

1407
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,270
I'm afraid I can't say,
our computers have crashed.

1408
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,077
What am I going to do?
I need that money.

1409
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,436
Come back later.
I'm very sorry.

1410
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,193
Yes, Rue Legrand here.

1411
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,278
Where are you?
We need you.

1412
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,794
But we called you
as soon as we opened!

1413
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,236
I'm telling you!

1414
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,593
Hurry up! Get over here!

1415
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,989
What a lazy lot!

1416
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,479
Back amongst us?

1417
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,154
Wasn't the last time enough for you?

1418
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:27,348
My father always said:
after a fall get back in the saddle.

1419
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,953
Who are you working for?

1420
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,954
A private consortium,
that's all I can say.

1421
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,112
What makes you think
we'll do business with you?

1422
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:35,997
Scrupulus.

1423
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:38,836
What?

1424
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:43,955
You know, the tiny pebble
that can hold up a whole army.

1425
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,753
You don't have the choice.

1426
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:49,911
If you refuse

1427
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,556
your property scam will collapse
like a house of cards.

1428
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,873
Julien my boy, I underestimated you.

1429
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,311
You're rather subtle...

1430
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,189
for a flunkey.

1431
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,197
You have half an hour.

1432
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,193
Is this a joke?

1433
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,635
I'll need a discharge
from my partners.

1434
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,430
You'll have our answer in a week.

1435
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,635
Impossible.

1436
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,549
I have another offer.

1437
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,630
May l?

1438
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,796
Who?

1439
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,634
An old victim of yours
happy to strike a deal.

1440
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,316
It will cost you more with him,
of course. A lot more.

1441
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,198
That takes the biscuit!

1442
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,515
He must be getting impatient.

1443
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,430
Etienne?

1444
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,555
What are you doing here?

1445
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,028
I'm signing on.

1446
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,672
I passed my exam.

1447
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,796
That's great!

1448
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,314
With double As.

1449
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:54,949
How about a kiss?

1450
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,428
Yes, sure.

1451
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,759
You look well.

1452
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,479
You look a bit peaky.

1453
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,470
oh yeah?

1454
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,312
I'm just going to bed.

1455
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,028
oK. Having a good time, eh?

1456
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,794
No, it's not that at all...

1457
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,231
You're even prettier than...

1458
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,592
You look wonderful!

1459
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,675
Fancy a coffee?

1460
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,070
You're on!

1461
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,198
It's lovely to see you.

1462
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,752
I often thought about you.

1463
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,712
- I was worried.
- Really?

1464
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,234
- Yes.
- That's sweet.

1465
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,718
Bravo, Julien. You learn fast.

1466
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,031
I trained at the top.
17 years in the Holy of Holies.

1467
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,314
17 years...

1468
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,275
My family have been rich
for 200 years,

1469
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,909
it gives me a bit of distance.

1470
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,038
You know what differentiates us
from people like you?

1471
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,511
What are "people like me"?

1472
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,474
Moneygrubbers.

1473
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,071
Who believe 100 million euros
will change their lives.

1474
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,479
People like me know
it won't change a thing.

1475
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,392
It will just help us make 200.

1476
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:10,916
Interesting.

1477
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,991
You have one minute left.

1478
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,031
Here's what I think, Julien.

1479
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,435
You're bluffing.

1480
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,352
And you bluff badly.

1481
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:27,954
You don't have another buyer
or a private consortium.

1482
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,150
No backers would risk
buying your stock.

1483
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,154
Unlike you, our rivals know
what they're up against with us.

1484
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,910
Soon you'll beg us
to buy your stock.

1485
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,878
You can go.

1486
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,236
Very good.

1487
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,549
As you like.

1488
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:55,911
Hello?

1489
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,275
It's me.

1490
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,670
I was just talking about you.

1491
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,271
Yes, my offer still stands.

1492
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,590
What?

1493
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,878
Let's say in half an hour?

1494
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,155
Your office?

1495
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:08,635
I'm on my way.

1496
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,157
Asshole!

1497
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,233
You know what you're into.

1498
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,833
Mr Foucault!

1499
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,079
You're in a hurry!

1500
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,352
Could you spare us a minute?

1501
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,195
Something tells me
you won't regret it.

1502
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,879
That's tiresome, I've just...

1503
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,237
Julien!
In memory of the good old days?

1504
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,233
Two electronic transfers:

1505
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,993
the stocks and the bonus.

1506
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,036
Right!

1507
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,509
I'll check immediately.

1508
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,110
Hello?

1509
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,318
Mr Lebrun, please.

1510
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,948
I must go.

1511
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,993
Shit! oh no...

1512
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,070
What's wrong?

1513
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,072
I have to make a call.

1514
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,311
Keep in touch? Promise?

1515
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,470
I promise.

1516
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:24,957
Julien?

1517
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,192
I'm sorry, I fucked up.

1518
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,914
Mr Martinez?

1519
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:52,038
All the accounts are down to zero.

1520
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:56,594
Whatever's going on,
knowing you it must be lucrative.

1521
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,475
It's not what you think.

1522
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,151
I'll pay every penny back right now.

1523
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,039
Don't imagine for a second
that I'll cover it.

1524
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,555
No one will ever know,
please Mr Martinez...

1525
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,516
Stop!

1526
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,071
You haven't understood, Gilbert.

1527
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,238
I'm not with the bank now.

1528
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,593
All I care about

1529
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,751
is...

1530
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:27,592
how much will I get
out of your little scam?

1531
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,878
18 million!
For that little fucker!

1532
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:37,557
Yes?

1533
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,394
Mr Lebrun is downstairs.

1534
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,034
Send him up.

1535
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,079
He'd rather you came down.

1536
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,635
He insists.

1537
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,915
Good God.

1538
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,515
He better not drop dead
before we sign.

1539
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,677
I have some good news.
one: I'm not selling.

1540
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,236
What?

1541
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,079
Impossible! It was agreed...

1542
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,710
That you handle transport,
not real estate speculation.

1543
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,078
Yes, d'Espinasse, walls have ears.

1544
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:18,829
Don't look so glum.

1545
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,719
You've just invested
in a solid company.

1546
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:26,955
And two: my health is much better.

1547
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,834
I'm delighted.

1548
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,596
Let's go, Pierre.

1549
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,516
What did he mean: walls have ears?

1550
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,910
That the little waiter
fucked us over nicely.

1551
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,153
Not too wet?

1552
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,628
Sorry? Wet with what?

1553
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:53,996
Bloody idiot!

1554
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:00,755
76 000. Transferred.

1555
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,673
Vincent Lambert.
Borealis Life: 92 000.

1556
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,512
92 000. Transferred.

1557
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,156
Shit!

1558
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:09,670
Not them!

1559
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,512
Did you call them?

1560
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,393
I'll deal with it.

1561
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,155
My friends.

1562
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,274
Heard the news?

1563
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,475
I've been fired.

1564
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,835
- You too?
- No, not you!

1565
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:25,716
Stuff their Multimoney.
I'm taking up fishing again.

1566
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,030
I suggest Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse.

1567
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,236
Yes? I know it well.

1568
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:34,792
But I may have an opening
in Polynesia.

1569
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,155
Let's drink to it.

1570
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,435
I insist!

1571
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,351
Come on.

1572
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,116
once it's been sorted, yes...

1573
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,829
Gentlemen!

1574
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,555
over to you.

1575
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,159
Did you have enough time?

1576
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,472
180 000€ is out there somewhere.

1577
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,711
180 000?

1578
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,032
That's 1% loss. Very reasonable.

1579
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,676
What's in that suitcase?
I hope you won't be arrested.

1580
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,319
Don't worry, darling.

1581
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,950
It's your father's money.
I'm returning it. No more scams.

1582
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:54,710
You're right.

1583
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,471
Money doesn't mean happiness.

1584
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,510
I'm as fit as a fiddle.

1585
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,796
I'll play tennis again this autumn.

1586
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,951
Remember what Dr Caumartin said.

1587
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,350
Marguerite's right, honey.

1588
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,114
You want to find yourself
a new partner!

1589
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:16,678
Anyway, I have to say
that the money you gave me...

1590
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,478
Enough! Say no more.

1591
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,234
No, I insist.
I must give it back to you...

1592
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,391
It's lost! Gone!

1593
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,709
It's only money.

1594
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,191
There's a positive side
to this heart attack:

1595
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,829
it's shown me what really matters.

1596
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,999
No, Antoine...

1597
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,119
Time to go, darling.
We mustn't tire daddy out.

1598
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,438
We should open for Sunday lunch.

1599
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,396
I can do a family menu for locals.
What d'you think?

1600
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,878
I think it's dead.

1601
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:55,876
Why?

1602
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,157
I've called her three times,
she doesn't answer.

1603
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,476
You idiot. You had me worried.

1604
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,636
Stéphanie? It's Julien.

1605
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,470
Stéphanie?

1606
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,037
often sleep under the stars?

1607
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,392
It depends on the star.

1608
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,635
Good news!

1609
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,552
Your transfer has arrived.

1610
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,314
I told you!
It's from my son.

1611
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,269
You shouldn't let
such a large sum lie idle.

1612
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,555
<i>Transfer received</i>

1613
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,110
You've heard about Multimoney?

1614
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:34,148
Madame?

1615
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,116
Madame Laffont!

1616
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,750
Are you alright?

1617
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,591
Yes. I'm fine.

1618
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,151
