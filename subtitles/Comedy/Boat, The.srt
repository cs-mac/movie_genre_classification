1
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Our bosun's mate.
Been on quite a bender tonight.

2
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,080
Who are those pigs?

3
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
Their fireboat drill.
They're all from my boat.

4
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,800
Captain.

5
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,280
Marten's crew.
They move out at dawn.

6
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,200
It's time to find ourselves
a little French quail.

7
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,680
Do you know how to flush it out?

8
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,000
They're scared. They comfort
themselves in women and schnapps.

9
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,880
- What's going on here?
- Ready ... Fire!

10
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,680
- Sir.
- My second officer.

11
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,680
This is Lieutenant Werner.
War correspondent.

12
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,800
He'll ship out with us, and report
the truth about life on a submarine.

13
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,600
- Welcome on board, Lieutenant.
- Good evening.

14
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Come and have a drink with us.

15
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,880
- Good evening, Captain.
- Two beers, please.

16
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,400
Where's our friend Thomsen?
He should be celebrating his medal.

17
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,080
Have you talked to your wife?

18
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,480
No calls to Germany
before 10 o'clock.

19
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,480
- Two beers.
- Thanks.

20
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Captain.

21
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,280
My report from U96, sir.
All provisions and arms aboard.

22
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,400
- Thank you.
- One more thing, Captain.

23
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,880
On the way here
some of the crew molested me.

24
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,400
It was ... quite outrageous.

25
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,680
- They stopped me and ...
- You were initiated?

26
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,280
- Exactly.
- Me, too.

27
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,200
May I have your attention?
Silence would be appreciated!

28
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,200
I'd like to call on Lt. Thomsen,
our latest hero!

29
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,880
Thomsen is from the old guard.
He's always drunk now.

30
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Quiet in this whorehouse!

31
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,680
To our wonderful ... abstaining ...
womanless Fuhrer, -

32
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,080
- who rose gloriously
from an apprentice painter -

33
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,000
- to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

34
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,680
Isn't it true?

35
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:22,400
He's a great naval expert.
Who, in his infinite wisdom ...

36
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,280
How does it go again?

37
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,400
Our great Fuhrer has been showing
their English bed-wetter ...

38
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,000
... the cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill ...

39
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,880
... where exactly to go
and stick his stinking cigars.

40
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,600
Excuse me.

41
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,200
I'll see you in the morning.
I must phone home.

42
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,680
Phillip, the old bunch has gone.

43
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:03,280
Look at these new heroes.
All wind and smoke. Big mouths.

44
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,480
Yeah, yeah ...

45
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,280
Cheeks together.
Balls in hand.

46
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,400
And the belief in our Fuhrer
in their eyes.

47
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,680
They will know in time.

48
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Combat! Conquer! Order!

49
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,280
Come on, Phillip.
Give me a hand. Help me get him up.

50
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,480
I wanted to really ...
screw my brains out tonight, -

51
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,080
- but I'm not
in any condition to fuck.

52
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,680
That's Thomsen's boat.
Find anything wrong with our boat?

53
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,880
- The propeller plate was banged.
- I see.

54
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,680
- That explains the whining noise.
- We've got a brand new one.

55
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,480
That's our boat.

56
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:02,600
Stand by for inspection! Attention!
Eyes left!

57
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,200
All hands present and accounted for.
The boat is clear for sea, Captain.

58
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,600
Thank you, Number One.

59
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,280
At ease.

60
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, men ...

61
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,600
- All set?
- All set, sir!

62
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,880
We have a guest on board.
Lt. Werner.

63
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,880
A war correspondent.
He has even brought his camera.

64
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,800
He is writing about war heroes.
See you remember your manners.

65
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
- Aye-aye, sir!
- Harbour stations, men.

66
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,880
Sink them all!

67
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,480
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.

68
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,280
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.

69
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,280
Fish store, where we maintain
and store the torpedoes.

70
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,680
- You're going to be in the papers!
- Thank you, men.

71
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Follow me. Here we have the can.
Just one for 50 men.

72
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,680
The other one's full of provisions.
You can't eat shit. Logical, no?

73
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,400
Here's the Chief Petty Officer's
quarters. My home away from home.

74
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,480
- I've brought plenty of books.
- You have it really cosy here.

75
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,600
- Where are you, Lieutenant?
- I hope you don't get sea sick.

76
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Here's the radio and the hydrophone.
The eyes and ears of the boat.

77
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,600
Here's the control room.
The boat's command post.

78
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,000
Through here, Lieutenant.

79
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,200
Wake up, you've got company.

80
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,600
Good morning, Lieutenant.

81
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,880
The petty officers' bunk
sleeps 12 men.

82
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,600
Two to a bunk.
One sleeps while one is on duty.

83
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,800
One man comes off watch and
climbs into the other man's stink.

84
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,280
You've got a bunk to yourself
since you're a guest on board.

85
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,680
- Here.
- This is your escape gear.

86
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,480
- You can use it in the shower.
- The mask helps out with the stink.

87
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,400
Of Frenssen's feet!

88
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,880
Come on.

89
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,280
This is our galley.
And here's Johann, our phantom.

90
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,400
Johann, everything in order?

91
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,480
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

92
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,080
It's better to take photos
on our return from the mission.

93
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,680
What do you mean?

94
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,680
They'll have grown beards by then.

95
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,800
The British will be ashamed
to see these shaven faces.

96
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,080
Pale-faced kids.
Innocents dragged from mama's skirt.

97
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Sailing with them
makes you feel so old.

98
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,680
It's like a children's crusade.

99
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,080
- Permission to pass, sir.
- Carry on.

100
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,080
- Bon appetit
- Thank you.

101
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,680
- From Mexico, aren't you?
- Yes. South of Mexico City.

102
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,480
- Good there?
- Very nice. Good climate.

103
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,680
- Quite a way.
- As a German, I had to come.

104
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,480
- Did you work there?
- On my step-parents' plantation.

105
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,600
- You're the boss's son?
- You could say so.

106
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,080
- Stand by, fiirst watch.
- Excuse me.

107
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,680
Can I get by?

108
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,200
Permission to go on watch, Captain.

109
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,800
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.

110
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,600
A young machine.
He follows orders without question.

111
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,200
He's so uptight he could
crack nuts with his butt cheeks.

112
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,880
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

113
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,800
Stand by main vents.

114
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:27,280
- Shut out main engines!
- All hands forward!

115
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,080
All hands forward!
Come on, move it.

116
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,480
Come on, move! Move! Faster!

117
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,680
Get a move on, you guys!

118
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,480
It's an alarm, not a blasted cruise!
Get into diving positions!

119
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,400
Blow negative tank.

120
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Stern planes ease to 10 degrees.

121
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Not bad. Practice makes perfect.
It keeps you from getting rusty.

122
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,000
A practice drill.

123
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,080
- Level off, Chief.
- Bow up 15. Stern up 10.

124
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,480
Planes on zero.

125
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,600
- Levelled off, sir.
- Shut all main vents.

126
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:58,200
- Main vents shut.
- Dive. Let's see how she does.

127
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,680
Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

128
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,480
The boat is rated to 90 metres,
but of course we could go deeper.

129
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,800
There's a limit somewhere.
We can only take so much pressure -

130
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,200
- before the boat will be crushed.

131
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,400
Check all valves.

132
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,880
Check all valves.

133
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,680
- The pressure.
- Yeah, sure.

134
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,000
Deeper.

135
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,600
140 metres.

136
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,680
- She must take this depth.
- 150.

137
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,280
160 metres.

138
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,800
- That'll do for now. Surface.
- Bow up 10. Stern up 5.

139
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,080
Our journalist is sweating.

140
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,480
Your girl?

141
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,000
French girl?

142
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,480
Do you know the flower shop
beside Café A I'Ami Pierrot?

143
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,600
- A I'Ami Pierrot.
- Sure, I know it.

144
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,800
The two pretty salesgirls.
Jeannette and ...

145
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Francoise.

146
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,880
Nobody knows ... but we're engaged.

147
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Unofficially.

148
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,800
Can I see?

149
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,200
Very pretty. Really.

150
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,480
What's wrong?

151
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,080
She's pregnant.

152
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,400
Don't you know what that means?

153
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,600
If the resistance finds out?
A German baby.

154
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,480
I told her,
but she wants to have it.

155
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,280
- She wants a baby.
- You've got problems, friend.

156
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,880
Our masters spend all their time
finding Churchill new nicknames.

157
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,800
What's the latest?

158
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,080
Drunken pig.

159
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,200
Fat boy.

160
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,280
Paralytic.

161
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,480
For a drunken paralytic
he's putting up a damn good fight.

162
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,280
We'll cut the swine to shreds.
That is my firm belief.

163
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,680
Listen, smart guy. Mr. Churchill
is a long way from shreds.

164
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,880
I'd like to know how many
of his ships are getting through -

165
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,280
- while we sit on our behinds
waiting for orders.

166
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,400
Our patrol planes.
Where are they, Herr Gِring?

167
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,480
The British have plenty of them.
Talking big is all he's good for.

168
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,280
Big heroes.
Nothing but hot air ... all of them.

169
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,000
Put that one down. It'll make
exciting reading in your epic.

170
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,400
The Propaganda Ministry
will love it.

171
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,880
Music we need.

172
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,480
Do you think our Hitler Youth leader
might put a record on for us?

173
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,200
The "Tipperary" song
if you have no objections.

174
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,800
- That stuff makes me puke.
- Now we're in the Royal Navy.

175
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,680
A record won't make you
into the king of England.

176
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,280
- Shut the door, you lazy pig!
- Stupid jerk!

177
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,680
They should use him as a doorstop,
his rear end's big enough.

178
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:49,800
One day he'll stick it in the can
and he'll never get it out again.

179
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,280
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.

180
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,800
- It stinks in here.
- Sweaty feet and hair grease.

181
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,280
Pilgrim's specialty.

182
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Smells just like old socks ...
these rotten eggs.

183
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,280
- Baby poo-poo.
- Pilgrim needs a chicken house.

184
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,280
Right. Ducks in the bilge.
Sweet little ducklings.

185
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,480
We could fatten them up
with jam from your filthy feet.

186
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:45,200
They'd have good fun
feeding on Frenssen's toe jam.

187
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,600
Aid to cleanliness, four letters?

188
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,800
Bath.

189
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,280
Thank you.

190
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,880
A desert animal with two humps?

191
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,800
- Camel.
- Perfect.

192
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,800
Intellectual starvation I would say.

193
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,880
It's completed, sir. Signal decoded.

194
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,880
One moment.

195
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,800
It could just about do it.
Five, six, seven ...

196
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,280
- Eight.
- New course, sir?

197
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,480
One minute.

198
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,880
What's the signal position, sir?

199
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,480
"Convoy square at AK 22,46."

200
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:30,280
"Mean course: 60 degrees.
Speed: 8 knots. U-boat 37."

201
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,080
U-boat 37. That's Marten's boat
moving in to attack.

202
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,480
- Too far away. We'd never make it.
- Bad luck.

203
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,600
Damn it!
When do we get some orders?

204
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:05,200
Come on, pull it out!
Slap more grease on it!

205
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,200
- For your journal?
- Yes, wonderful stuff.

206
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
You there, this way a moment.

207
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,280
It's nicely greased with vaseline.
We're ready to ram it in!

208
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,800
Can you just look this way?
Yes, good.

209
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,800
Not quite so fast. This way. Great!

210
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,800
Stay here in the foreground.
Let's have some with a different ...

211
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Who did that?

212
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,200
Who did that?

213
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,880
Tell me now ...
Have you got any hairs up your nose?

214
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,800
- Why?
- I've got some up mine.

215
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Maybe we could knit them together.

216
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,880
"2nd November, 1941 .
Dear Francoise ..."

217
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:30,080
"20th day at sea."

218
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,680
- Alarm!
- Alarm!

219
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,000
- Hatch secured!
- All main vents open!

220
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,080
- Shadow off the starboard beam.
- Take her down 30 metres.

221
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,600
Bring her up easy.
Planes on zero.

222
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,600
- Anything on the starboard beam?
- Propeller sounds.

223
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
1 10 degrees.

224
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,680
Way aft of us.

225
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,480
Contact growing fainter.

226
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,280
Fading fast, sir.

227
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Right ... we'd better stay down now.
Steer 120.

228
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,680
A lone ship traveling fast.
We have no chance in this light.

229
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,000
"lt's more than superficial to take
care in personal appearance."

230
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,480
"lt denotes that the inner man
is wholesome and upstanding."

231
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,600
"An officer should be unpretentious
in his dress and deportment."

232
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,600
"ln the old days young officers
were treated indulgently in this."

233
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,080
"Knowing they risked their lives,
their superiors ..."

234
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,080
It's comfortable here.

235
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,080
No mail. No telephone.

236
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,480
A well-ventilated boat.
Solid wood panelling.

237
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,480
Free food, too.
We're in clover here.

238
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,680
Like fresh horse droppings.

239
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,880
They're rolling in clover, too.
No need to work.

240
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,080
They're even allowed to smoke.

241
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,000
U-boat special cocktail.
Want some?

242
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,280
Stop that!

243
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,400
Our recent triumphs.

244
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,480
"Dived to evade enemy aircraft."

245
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:40,680
"Dived to avoid destroyer.
Depth charged."

246
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,200
The British
have stopped making mistakes.

247
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,680
Cut off extra supply of fuel
to the engines!

248
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Torpedo rooms ...
check the gyro-angles.

249
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:24,080
- Watch out!
- Check periscope alignment.

250
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,880
- What's going on?
- Here we go, girls.

251
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,400
U-32 has spotted a British convoy.
We should be there in 10 hours.

252
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,880
U - 32 is operating against a convoy.
We arejoining in the hunt

253
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,480
Contact expected
any time after 18:00 hours.

254
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,600
These beauties
are ready for blast off.

255
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,000
Over 30 freighters.

256
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,400
Berthold is waiting for us to
arrive. He's following the convoy.

257
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,080
For me it's the best thrill
with U-boats and sailing ships.

258
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,400
Skimming across the sea.

259
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:25,800
I've sailed on a schooner.
Roomy. Holds as big as churches.

260
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,800
- That's a fine way to waste fuel.
- Lunatic!

261
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,080
Damn this weather!

262
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,400
We could pass the British completely
without seeing them.

263
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,680
We should be within range.
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?

264
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,880
Why haven't we heard from H.Q.?

265
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,480
Visibility is nil, sir.
It's useless!

266
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,480
Prepare to dive!

267
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,680
Clear the bridge now!

268
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,600
Diving positions.
Stand by main vents.

269
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:10,600
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.

270
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:16,680
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.

271
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,880
Bow planes zero. Stern zero.

272
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,400
What's up? Why are we diving?

273
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,280
A hydrophone check.

274
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,200
In bad weather you can hear more
than you can see on the surface.

275
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,880
Stern planes up 5.
Easy. Both planes zero.

276
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,080
Can't you make a contact?

277
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,000
Nothing?

278
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,480
Captain, come here.

279
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,080
Contact bearing 060. Quite faint.

280
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,680
Depth charges.

281
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,080
They are blasting someone.

282
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,480
What's the bearing from us now.

283
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,600
Moving right. 045 degrees.

284
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,480
Moving away from us.

285
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:21,480
- Surface. Steer 330.
- All ahead two-thirds.

286
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:27,400
Note this in our log book. Despite
bad weather, commencing operation.

287
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,600
Damn this stinking weather!
How does it look?

288
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:14,280
- The enemy should be here.
- Freighter on the starboard bow.

289
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:25,280
- Over there! 040 and closing.
- Damn it!

290
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,600
That's no freighter.
Oh no! A destroyer!

291
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,200
It's coming straight at us.
Clear the bridge.

292
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,000
Take her down!

293
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,280
Diving stations.

294
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:06,880
- Come to periscope depth.
- All planes up 10.

295
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,800
Steady at 2 metres.

296
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,480
Both planes zero.

297
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,880
Stern down 5.

298
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,000
Come up.

299
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,880
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.

300
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,000
- Stand by battle stations.
- Out of the way, damn it!

301
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,280
Gangway!

302
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,480
Faster! Faster!

303
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,000
Keep her level, Chief.

304
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:44,280
- Flood tubes one to four.
- Flood tubes one to four.

305
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:51,080
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.

306
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,600
- Watch your depth, Chief.
- Bow planes up 2. Stern down 2.

307
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,280
Come on.

308
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:11,400
Both planes come to zero.
13.5 metres.

309
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,880
Open bow caps now.

310
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,280
Enemy's speed: 10.
Range: 6,000.

311
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,480
Depth: 2 metres.

312
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:46,000
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread torpedoes one and three.

313
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,400
Spread shots one and three.

314
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,280
Tubes one through four are ready.

315
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:21,200
Damn it! What happened to them?

316
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,800
Close bow caps! Dive!

317
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,400
Depth charges dropped.

318
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,200
- Get some fuses, quick!
- Check all valves and closures.

319
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,000
No serious damage.

320
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,080
They must've spotted our periscope.

321
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,680
- Control room all secure.
- Incredible in this sea.

322
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,400
- Is it getting louder?
- It seems constant. Ahead of us.

323
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,200
280.

324
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:43,480
280 minus 35 ...

325
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:56,280
- It's pulling further ahead. 295.
- Left full rudder.

326
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,600
- Rudder is left full.
- Steer due north.

327
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,800
- Deeper, Chief.
- Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

328
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,600
- Pump 200 litres forward.
- Steering due north, sir.

329
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:24,280
- 200 litres forward.
- Main motors ahead one-third.

330
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,680
Now it gets psychological, friends.

331
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,080
Easy, men.
There's more to come yet.

332
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,880
Kill unnecessary lights.

333
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,480
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines at 50 rpm.

334
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,080
Both engines indicate 50 rpm.

335
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:24,800
Contact coming closer.
Starboard bow. Closing fast.

336
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,280
Main engines full ahead.
Right full rudder.

337
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,480
Both main engines ahead full.

338
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,000
They're coming straight for us.

339
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:11,600
- He knows what he's doing. Deeper.
- Bow down 20. Stern up 5.

340
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,400
- Destroyer almost above us.
- Deeper, Chief. Quick.

341
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,200
DEPTH GAUGE

342
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,280
Don't be afraid.
It's only the pressure.

343
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,880
- Deeper.
- Stern up 15.

344
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,880
150 metres.

345
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,080
Hurry!

346
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:02,280
- Tighten that flange.
- Bring her up to 150 metres.

347
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,680
Forward up 20. Stern down.10.

348
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:14,280
Come on, Frenssen, quickly!
Get the damn thing tightened!

349
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:39,800
Hull valves secured.
Both planes read zero.

350
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,400
Level at 150 metres.

351
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,480
Becoming louder.
She's turned around. 055.

352
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,400
Go on, get it over.

353
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,480
Contact closing fast.

354
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:36,800
They are above us ...
just above us.

355
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,200
Contact fading to starboard.

356
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,680
22.

357
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,080
- 23.
- They are far away.

358
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,680
Contact receding aft.

359
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,280
I can barely hear it.

360
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,080
- Now?
- It has passed us by.

361
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,280
I think that will be all, this time.

362
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:38,080
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.

363
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:49,480
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- All compartments report damage.

364
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,880
From my private collection.

365
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,800
- How is the engine room?
- Smashed up badly.

366
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,880
- Will you be able to patch her up?
- I've already started.

367
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:41,000
Make it good. I've got a feeling
we're going to see some action.

368
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,080
Nothing?

369
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:16,200
- We've waited over an hour now.
- I guess we have shaken them off.

370
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:23,080
Don't be too sure. He could
have stopped and be waiting -

371
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:30,880
- to surprise us when we surface.
Not dumb, the British.

372
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,200
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark, we'll surface.

373
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,480
I see better in the dark.

374
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,200
Captain.

375
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,080
Thanks.

376
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:00,680
- What's it like up top?
- It's dark.

377
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:09,200
- Go up to 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 15. Stern up 5.

378
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,400
90, 80 ...

379
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:18,080
70, 60 metres.

380
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,480
50. Coming up fast.

381
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:30,080
- Sound check at 30.
- She's level at 30 metres.

382
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,880
Well?

383
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,480
Periscope depth.

384
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:00,480
Bow up 3.
Stern down five.

385
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,080
Zero.

386
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,080
- Surface.
- All set to blow.

387
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,680
Cut it out! All this damn noise!

388
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:31,080
- I've got bad news, men.
- What's up now?

389
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,000
Our team is losing.

390
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,480
5-0.

391
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,280
Not a chance
of making the finals now.

392
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,880
It can't be! I don't believe it!

393
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,600
Drop 'em!

394
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,880
You dirty little boy. Crabs!

395
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,280
A whole army of them. They'll eat
your winkie down to the bone.

396
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,680
Give him a go with gun powder!

397
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,080
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

398
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,680
This meat needs a shave.

399
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:24,400
What are those things
crawling about on your eyebrows?

400
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:29,000
- Pardon?
- You'd better see the medic.

401
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,880
Crabs by the look of them.

402
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:44,400
When the creatures begin to surface,
it's the fifth stage.

403
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
- Get it all in the torpedo room.
- You two, give me a hand.

404
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,880
Bosun,
do you know where the medic is?

405
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,600
Yeah, in the bow compartment.

406
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:18,800
- The more the merrier.
- Have the crabs got you, too?

407
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:43,200
- Lieutenant!
- What?

408
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:49,680
Take it easy! Calm down!
Have you gone crazy?

409
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:59,080
Have you heard the latest?
Our Dufte is tying the knot.

410
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:05,800
- The stupid pig.
- Half the fleet have tried her.

411
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
They should stick you in a zoo
with a chimpanzee.

412
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:16,480
- Here's the pictures of her!
- You dirty, rotten swine!

413
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,800
Don't tell me this hag
lets you sleep with her.

414
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:08,600
These boats are built to take it.
You should try a sailing ship.

415
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,400
You hardly feel a thing down here.

416
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,680
- Captain.
- Compass.

417
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:41,080
She's heaving to starboard.
I can't keep on course.

418
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,600
No cause for concern.

419
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:54,680
It's pointless, sir.
We're burning up fuel for nothing.

420
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,800
Prepare to dive.

421
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,600
Diving stations.
Stand by all main vents.

422
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,880
Nothing exciting out there?

423
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:20,280
Position reports and very faint
SOS calls from enemy freighters.

424
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,600
When the rudder breaks
on one of those old tenders ...

425
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,680
... there's nothing to do but pray.

426
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:45,480
The sea can't sink us, Hinrich.
No ships are as safe as our U-boats.

427
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,600
Hinrich.

428
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:06,080
Put the record on again.
You know the one.

429
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,000
Watch out!

430
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,400
Look out!

431
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,480
Man overboard!

432
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,800
Pilgrim!

433
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,880
Hold on!

434
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:18,480
- Get his legs.
- I've got him. Make way!

435
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,480
- His legs!
- Hurry, will you? Move!

436
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,000
- Lay him out flat.
- Get his hood off quickly.

437
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,280
Pilgrim.

438
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:38,680
Bring the first-aid kit, damn it!

439
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,280
Prepare to dive.

440
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:55,480
"Self-discipline is the only road
to military leadership ..."

441
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:02,280
Three ribs cracked
and a gash on the head.

442
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,600
He was lucky.

443
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:13,000
What a rotten month.
Absolutely rotten.

444
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,400
Mildew is good for you.

445
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:26,000
It's the next best thing to ...
fresh-grown lettuce.

446
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:35,200
Anything that grows on this boat
we've got to be grateful for.

447
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,800
It must be snowing already
back home.

448
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,880
Very funny.

449
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,600
It's been years since I saw snow.

450
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,200
- Can I look?
- Sure.

451
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,400
Your wife?

452
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,480
Look! There, in front!

453
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,800
Captain, U-boat on port bow.

454
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,600
It's one of ours.

455
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:48,080
A German U-boat! Over there!

456
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:57,000
You're right.

457
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:01,880
- Both engines stop.
- Bring up the lights.

458
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,280
Look, it's Thomsen!

459
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,880
- All back.
- It's Thomsen!

460
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:59,400
Good hunting, you old rascal!

461
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:13,400
My God, Phillip!
So they pushed you out to sea again.

462
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:19,800
Damn it! How can this happen?

463
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,400
Damn it! How can this happen?

464
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:32,400
12 boats we've got on the Atlantic,
from Greenland to the Azores.

465
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:38,080
But still we almost collide
with one of our own.

466
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:42,880
60 metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.

467
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,800
Something is wrong here.

468
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:54,880
- Have you checked on our position?
- More or less.

469
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,600
More or less is not good enough!

470
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:05,200
We've not had a sun shot in 14 days.
We've been drifting in this storm.

471
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,080
It's hard to compute.

472
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:22,480
If we make an error in our position,
and the others do the same, -

473
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:27,000
- we end up playing collision games.
The route is wide open.

474
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:32,800
The British could shove
the whole armada through.

475
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,080
Yeah, yeah ...

476
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:43,480
Another story in the middle
of the ocean, Lieutenant.

477
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:49,400
I hope you're making notes. Maybe
headquarters will listen to you.

478
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:56,680
- You've more influence than I have.
- So ... you believe that?

479
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,880
Have you got your flashlight ready?
It's bound to be a false alarm.

480
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,880
- What's up?
- A convoy.

481
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:47,080
- Permission to come up?
- Permitted.

482
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:38,400
Outward bound convoy. Five columns.
Very juicy.

483
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,600
Any escorts in sight? Destroyers?

484
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:51,200
No, no screen.
They have no protection. Nothing.

485
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,600
That's funny.

486
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:05,600
They could be off
chasing one of ours.

487
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,600
That damn moon!

488
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:22,480
- How many of our boats are here?
- Five.

489
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Do we risk it?

490
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
It's worth a try, Captain.

491
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,800
Come left to 180.

492
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,080
Left 5 degrees rudder.
New course: 180.

493
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,800
Steady on course 180.

494
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,600
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?

495
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,280
It'll work. We've got them.

496
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,680
Prepare tubes one to four
for surface firing.

497
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:18,000
- I'm going in.
- Master-sight to bridge.

498
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,600
Tubes one to four flooded.

499
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:41,000
All ahead full. Left full rudder.
Stand by to attack!

500
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,280
Watch the pressure
of the lubricating oil.

501
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:55,480
- Bearing: 050.
- Locked on.

502
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,480
Range: 2,200 metres.

503
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:05,000
Those two over that way.
Then we'll drop on the big one.

504
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:11,680
- Targets identifiied.
- Open the bow caps.

505
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:18,400
Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle: 063.

506
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,480
Follow for bearing.

507
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:29,000
Tubes one and two,
fire when matched.

508
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,480
Tube one, fire!

509
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,480
Tube two, fire!

510
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:43,200
- Tube three, fire when matched.
- Tube three ready.

511
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:46,880
Tube three, fire!

512
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:54,280
Tube four ready.
Tube four, fire!

513
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,280
Destroyer ahead!

514
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,480
Alarm!

515
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,080
All men forward! Diving positions!

516
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:13,600
Quick, keep it moving!

517
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,480
- Clear the way.
- Move, move, move!

518
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:34,080
- Battle stations!
- Out of the way.

519
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:41,000
Bow planes up 10. Stern up 5.

520
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:45,000
Keep quite!

521
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,400
Down 80 metres. Easy.

522
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:54,880
Bow down 15. Stern up 10.

523
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:02,560
- What about the torpedoes?
- Any minute now.

524
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,360
Not long to go now.

525
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,480
1 10 ...

526
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:25,760
- 120.
- Those torpedoes don't run true.

527
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:33,480
It was crazy to attack like that.
That destroy won't let us go.

528
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,680
He'll try and hunt us down.

529
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:51,080
- We hit the first.
- Out of the way. We hit her!

530
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,960
Quiet!

531
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:20,360
Time's up for the third torpedo.

532
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,680
Number three.

533
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,680
Now they are going to the bottom.

534
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:01,480
It's the bulkheads.
They've collapsed.

535
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,960
This is it.

536
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,560
Now we have the payoff.

537
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:43,080
Destroyer bearing 044.
Moving left. Fading, sir.

538
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:02,280
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

539
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:07,880
Rudder's right full.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

540
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,760
They're astern of us ...

541
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,960
... way astern of us.

542
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:23,080
They're spitting
in the wrong direction.

543
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:36,960
We haven't thrown them off yet.
I reckon they won't be too happy.

544
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:43,680
Propeller noises bearing 270.
Closing.

545
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,560
Both engines ahead one-third.

546
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:01,760
- Both engines ahead one-third.
- Now we'll see.

547
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:33,280
All ahead full.
Pump out 150 litres.

548
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:40,680
Pump out 150 litres. Ahead full!

549
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:38,880
Asdic detection system.
Ultrasonic.

550
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:48,680
The filthy rotten swine!

551
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:05,560
- What's the damage?
- Air shaft fractured.

552
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,960
Quiet, boys.

553
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:18,760
Nice and quiet now.

554
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:08,160
- Hold that speed.
- 50 rpm.

555
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,680
Left 15 degrees.

556
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:18,160
Steering left 15, sir.

557
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,080
All ahead full!

558
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,760
Let's get the hell out of here!

559
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:50,080
- One of the valves is fractured!
- Isolate it!

560
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,360
God! We're on fire!

561
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:02,680
Cut the number two auxiliary!

562
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,080
Calm down for God's sake!

563
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:41,280
- Chief, emergency ventilation.
- Switch on fans.

564
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:14,080
She doesn't want to let go of us.

565
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:26,960
What's going on? Running away?

566
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:48,480
We really smashed them.
Did you hear those bulkheads burst?

567
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:07,160
- What's her bearing?
- 065. Bearing constant.

568
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:14,880
Deeper, Chief. Silent speed.

569
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:41,080
Bearing?

570
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:46,880
050. Growing louder.

571
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:01,680
Yeah, yeah ...

572
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,160
Yeah, sure.

573
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:23,560
Deeper still. Right 30 degrees.

574
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:30,280
We'll try doubling back.
Keep them guessing.

575
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:41,760
Bow planes steady. Stern up 10.

576
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:31,480
Contact bearing 270.

577
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:36,880
It's fading.

578
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:56,880
- Right full rudder.
- Rudder is full right, sir.

579
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:01,760
Steer 090.

580
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,480
No!

581
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:26,560
Second contact closing fast.
Bearing: 076.

582
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:32,880
Damn them!

583
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:37,880
Another one.

584
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:11,160
- Deeper.
- Sir ..?

585
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,080
Yes, deeper.

586
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,280
Bow planes down 10. Stern up 7.

587
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,760
190 metres.

588
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,480
200 metres.

589
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,560
210 metres.

590
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:19,280
220 metres.

591
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:28,480
230 metres.

592
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:43,480
- The bolts are bursting!
- 10 metres rise.

593
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:47,160
All ahead.

594
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,560
Quiet, men!

595
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:25,360
Quiet.

596
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:39,560
Bring her up to 150 metres!
Full ahead!

597
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,160
Full ahead both, sir.

598
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:50,680
Left 20 degrees.
Steer 050.

599
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:54,080
He is near his mark.

600
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:01,360
The foundation bolts are loose!

601
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:38,480
- I want accurate damage reports.
- Water's pouring in!

602
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:48,880
- The engine room is leaking water!
- I'll go and take a look.

603
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:52,160
Number One, take over.

604
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:56,880
It's the exhaust flap.

605
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:02,880
- The plunge bolts have sheared.
- The gaskets!

606
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:08,480
Bring me new gaskets. Move it!

607
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:14,480
- Torpedo hatch taking water.
- Give us some light.

608
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,680
Crow bar!

609
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:30,080
They'll soon be out of ammunition.

610
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:47,880
The exhaust flap is secured, sir.

611
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:54,560
- 50 metres. All ahead full.
- Torpedo hatch is secured.

612
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,680
What's wrong, Johann?

613
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:23,080
Get back to your battle station,
right now.

614
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:38,680
Don't disobey my orders.
Do as you're told!

615
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:45,560
I order you, Johann.

616
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:50,680
Aft, Johann!

617
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:02,160
Take him aft, boys.
Hold him down.

618
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:11,160
He's under control.

619
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:55,160
Who'd have thought it of Johann?

620
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:01,160
Degrading. Shameful.

621
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:24,280
Forget it, Hinrich.
We can hear them.

622
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,560
That's it. Come on.

623
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:11,080
170 metres.

624
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:17,160
190 metres.

625
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,880
200.

626
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:49,560
- Man your stations.
- 220 metres!

627
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,080
We're sinking!

628
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:56,560
We're sinking!

629
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:05,160
- Make a note for the war diary.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

630
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:13,080
Stayed submerged for six hours
at silent speed.

631
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:17,160
Satisfied
the destroyers have lost us.

632
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:25,560
Intense glow in sky
observed at 210 degrees.

633
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,680
Probably flames
from the tanker we hit.

634
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:44,280
- We'll surface in ten minutes.
- Switch to red light.

635
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:53,760
First watch, stand by for duty.

636
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:20,760
You see, Lieutenant ...

637
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:26,360
... they didn't kill us.

638
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:32,680
Her back's already broken.

639
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:38,960
She is a tough one.
She won't go down.

640
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:48,080
Let's finish her off.
A final shot. Prepare to fire.

641
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:54,560
Number one tube is flooded.
Ready forsurface fiiring.

642
01:58:54,680 --> 01:59:00,560
Target's speed: Zero.
Range: 650 metres.

643
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:04,680
Depth: Four metres.
Torpedo speed: 30.

644
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:09,280
Aiming point: Forward of aft mast.

645
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:12,960
Tube one ready.

646
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:16,560
Tube one ... Fire!

647
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:01,760
- There are still men on board.
- There!

648
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:16,880
Why didn't their own ships
rescue them?

649
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:19,760
They've had six hours.

650
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:51,360
- They're swimming towards us.
- Both engines back two-thirds.

651
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:54,960
We can't take prisoners.
You know that.

652
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:08,160
May I clear the table, sir?

653
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:35,560
Here, take it.

654
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:43,160
- Some more signals, sir.
- Go ahead.

655
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:47,880
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoy dispersed into groups."

656
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:53,560
Contact broken.
Closing course: 030. U-1 12.

657
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:58,480
Wenzel ... not bad.

658
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:05,480
Kupsch is on the same convoy.
Stackmann torpedoed a 6,000 tonner.

659
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:13,080
They're having a field day.
Any hope of joining them?

660
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:21,360
Difficult. A minimum
of five hours away at full speed.

661
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:25,880
- We can't make it.
- Yes, yes!

662
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:51,080
Sir, when do we go back?

663
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:02,480
When it's time for us to go back ...
and not before, Kriechbaum.

664
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:38,160
"Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast."

665
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:42,360
"Crew was still on board.
Swam toward U-96."

666
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:19,760
Captain ...

667
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:28,080
- I wish to apologize.
- There's nothing to be said.

668
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:35,680
You deserted your post at a critical
moment and disobeyed a direct order.

669
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:53,680
You mean to say that
there has to be a court martial?

670
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:02,360
- How many patrols have you done?
- Nine, sir.

671
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,960
Why you, Johann?

672
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:19,360
It was a mistake.
I didn't ... It was ...

673
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:22,360
It ...

674
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:31,880
All of a sudden ... As if ...

675
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:40,160
It won't ever happen again, sir.
You can depend on it.

676
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:48,280
- I swear.
- All right, Johann.

677
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:54,880
Then there's no court martial?

678
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:01,880
Get some sleep.

679
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:19,560
Decision, return to La Rochelle.

680
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:39,360
Cipher officer.

681
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:48,680
- Have you found the problem?
- It's the bulkhead conduit.

682
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:52,280
Good, get it fixed.

683
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:56,760
Good morning.

684
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:01,160
Get moving.
There's a signal to be decoded.

685
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:14,080
Suppose it's top secret.
Another wild goose chase.

686
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:18,360
They're not much use to us.
This relic needs a refit.

687
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:23,280
On the fuel we've got
we won't even make La Rochelle.

688
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:28,280
We'll hoist a sail.
Don't worry, Chief.

689
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:33,680
Decoded it yet?

690
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:41,280
- What is it?
- Top secret. For the captain only.

691
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:08,960
Very strange.
It's triple enciphered.

692
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:20,560
Christmas in La Rochelle.
Real girls in Christmas stockings.

693
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:26,280
Sexy little nurses
to comfort and kiss.

694
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:31,760
- We'll have a ball!
- A Valkyrie, big and fat.

695
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:38,360
Now here this.
La Rochelle is out I'm sorry.

696
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:45,760
We have a new destination.
La Spezia Naval Base in ltaly.

697
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:52,760
We'll pick up fuel and supplies
at Viigo in Spain. That's all.

698
02:09:55,480 --> 02:10:00,360
Swine. He must be crazy.

699
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:05,760
- What a rotten trick.
- There goes our Christmas stocking.

700
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:13,160
- No sexy little nurses.
- I'd like to kill those morons!

701
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:18,560
- We'll have Christmas in ltaly.
- We've got to get there first!

702
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:22,760
- And so?
- Gibraltar!

703
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:27,160
Use your brain, you idiot!
That strait ...

704
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:37,360
It's like the eye of a needle.
We'll never slip through there.

705
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:59,760
The Mediterranean. It's madness.
It's swarming with combat ships.

706
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:07,080
Stand by ...
Zero. 25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.

707
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:14,360
Gibraltar. It's the best chance
to get ourselves killed.

708
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:33,280
When we reach Vigo,
you go ashore with the chief.

709
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:38,560
- But, sir ...
- I've already made the decision.

710
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:46,560
I've got to find
a replacement for the chief.

711
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:52,280
Our agents will smuggle you
out of Spain somehow.

712
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:56,080
Dressed up as gypsies, for instance.

713
02:11:56,160 --> 02:12:01,880
- I thought I would be going ...
- No arguments.

714
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:07,960
It's all settled.
It's easier to get two of you out.

715
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:15,160
I really believe
the chief needs a break.

716
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:29,560
His wife is very ill.

717
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:35,160
He must get home.

718
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:42,560
I understand, sir.

719
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:59,280
Tough break.

720
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:15,760
When we reach Vigo, it's goodbye.
The captain's ordered me ashore.

721
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:21,360
The chief leaves, too.

722
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:28,760
I ... could deliver
your mail for you.

723
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:39,480
Yeah.

724
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:49,080
There's quite a bunch of them here.

725
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:55,560
Well, it's quite a romance,
isn't it?

726
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:37,080
Equalize.

727
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:50,960
- Help me out with the gear.
- Quiet, men!

728
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:57,760
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees rudder.

729
02:14:57,960 --> 02:15:02,960
Now we just have to find
this little barge.

730
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:06,680
"SS Weser."

731
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:10,960
A German merchant ship.
She's got herself interned here.

732
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:18,080
- With torpedoes, fuel and supplies.
- All for us, Kriechbaum.

733
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:21,560
First-class service.

734
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:36,880
Starboard engines stop.

735
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:42,560
- We arrived.
- Port engines stop.

736
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:53,560
Officers to bridge.

737
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:09,760
Gentlemen ...

738
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,160
Three cheers
for our galant U-boat men.

739
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:35,080
- You are most welcome, Captain.
- No, no ...

740
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:42,560
- This is our commander.
- My apologies, sir.

741
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:48,960
A pleasure to have you aboard
the 'Weser", Captain.

742
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:54,160
A hero.
I'm delighted to be so honoured.

743
02:16:54,360 --> 02:17:00,360
Gentlemen, here they stand,
our heroes of the deep.

744
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:09,080
The grey wolves.
Our humble ship is honoured.

745
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:12,360
Captain, lead the way.

746
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:16,760
- Welcome on board.
- What a nice clean tugboat.

747
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:25,080
We've done what we can for you.
I hope it's to your taste.

748
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:28,960
Quite a table. Just like home.

749
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:36,280
Fresh bread. Cakes. Fruit.
Sausage, our chef's specialty.

750
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:40,960
We're waiting to hear your news.

751
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:44,960
You can't imagine
what it means to us.

752
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:48,480
It isn't easy here.
It's very frustrating.

753
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:52,080
Sure, there's plenty to eat.
Fuel is no problem.

754
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:59,360
Torpedoes are very tricky though ...
but you're all set up.

755
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:06,480
The Spaniards tolerate us, but
that's about all. Christmas cake.

756
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:14,960
How many ship have you sunk?
I guess about ...

757
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:19,680
Oh, champagne. Take a glass.

758
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:26,560
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.
Drink to our heroes.

759
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:34,080
To the German U-boat service
and out beloved Fuhrer ...

760
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:40,080
We're not exactly at home ...
if you understand what I mean.

761
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:42,480
All the best.

762
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:53,880
- There's plenty for everyone.
- Let's get down to business.

763
02:18:57,560 --> 02:19:03,960
Tell us all about it, Captain.
I'm bursting with curiosity.

764
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:07,360
Those are fresh figs.

765
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:12,280
Fresh figs!

766
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:17,960
I've never had one.

767
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:25,160
Yeah ...

768
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:33,480
This time we very nearly had it.

769
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:42,280
Phenomenal. You see, gentlemen,
that's the stuff heroes are made of.

770
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:47,360
Phenomenal, that's what it is.
I want to hear more, Captain.

771
02:19:47,560 --> 02:19:54,960
Give me your plate. Herring salad.
The chef's mother's own recipe.

772
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:00,960
Just taste that. There's lots more.

773
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:08,360
So ...
what's it like to be under water -

774
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:11,760
- while overhead
the enemy lies in wait?

775
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:16,280
- It's dark.
- Dark?

776
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:22,360
- Yes, and very quiet.
- Just as long as no one belches.

777
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:27,880
- Why is that?
- I can explain what he means.

778
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:31,280
We're often running at silent speed.

779
02:20:31,480 --> 02:20:36,880
- And that's why you can't belch!
- The men from Madrid are here.

780
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:40,280
Seewald, we've been expecting you.
Captain, over here.

781
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:48,160
The representative
of our naval attache here.

782
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:51,760
I have some
communications from Berlin.

783
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:56,480
First the documents
for the breakthrough.

784
02:20:57,480 --> 02:21:01,560
Then ... this cable came.

785
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:15,160
Chief, Lt. Werner.

786
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:21,960
We are going for a little fresh air.

787
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:33,760
- What's happening, Seewald?
- Bad news.

788
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:44,360
Headquarters say no.
Our request has been denied, Chief.

789
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:53,480
There's no replacement.
You'll stay too, Werner.

790
02:21:58,360 --> 02:22:01,360
I'm sorry.

791
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:06,960
I guess it's just as well.

792
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:13,880
Who knows what kind of idiot
they'd have sent you.

793
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:19,280
One of those new found warriors
who's all wind and smoke.

794
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:27,760
You could be right.

795
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:31,480
They could have sent us
some senoritas.

796
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:38,080
It's a good thing they didn't.
Spanish crabs. That's all we'd need.

797
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:43,560
Get that chart table cleared.
I can't navigate on bananas.

798
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:49,160
What do you think you're doing?
Get that fruit out of here.

799
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:57,160
- Is that a Christmas tree?
- No, camouflage for the bridge.

800
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:02,760
We're staying.
They won't replace us.

801
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:16,960
I'm sorry, Ullman.

802
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:38,160
7 miles from coast to coast.
A bit narrow.

803
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:46,680
These are the only British dockyards
in the western Mediterranen.

804
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:51,960
They are very heavily defended.

805
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:59,160
The place will be crawling
with patrol boats.

806
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:03,960
Anything that floats
will be on the water.

807
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:11,960
This is where we have to go.
That's the situation.

808
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:29,880
We move in under darkness.
On the surface.

809
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:37,080
We'll see if we can slip through.

810
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:44,560
As near to Gibraltar as we can get.

811
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:59,160
Then dive down
and let ourselves drift through.

812
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:07,360
And so ...

813
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:16,360
... dive and let the surface current
pull us through the Strait.

814
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:21,480
It's an easy trick.

815
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:28,080
Quiet as a shadow
and we burn less fuel.

816
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:40,160
Well, Kriechbaum?

817
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:48,160
Clever trick, Captain.

818
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:14,480
Right, let's get going.

819
02:26:18,480 --> 02:26:22,080
All ahead two-thirds.

820
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:29,080
The navigator and I stay up here.
Now clear the bridge.

821
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:51,080
- Come right to 079.
- Course: 079.

822
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:02,560
Half the British fleet is out there.

823
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:09,960
Come left 20 degrees.
Change to main motors.

824
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:16,560
It's very kind of the enemy
to show their navigation lights.

825
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:24,280
Come left another 10.
Steer 050.

826
02:27:24,480 --> 02:27:27,080
Course: 050.

827
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:46,280
Destroyer on port bow.
Range: 800.

828
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:49,560
Going which way?
ls she closing?

829
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:59,960
- No, she's heading away.
- That's good.

830
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:06,680
Left full rudder. All ahead full.

831
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:10,880
Rudder is left full.
All engines indicate ahead full.

832
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:15,680
Steady as you go.

833
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:38,280
- Come right. Course: 079.
- Course: 079.

834
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:44,680
- All ahead two-thirds.
- Engines indicate ahead two-thirds.

835
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:08,960
Right full rudder. Quick!

836
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:12,160
- Right full rudder.
- Damn!

837
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:27,760
Kriechbaum ...

838
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:32,360
Gibraltar.

839
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:55,360
We'll dive in 10 minutes.

840
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:13,080
Alarm!

841
02:30:17,560 --> 02:30:22,560
- Alarm!
- Don't dive! The captain's up top!

842
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:29,960
Navigator wounded.
Start flooding!

843
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:33,960
Stand by escape gear.
Ready to abandon ship!

844
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:41,160
- Where's the escape gear?
- Calm down!

845
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:43,960
Bring the medic!

846
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:50,360
Both engines maximum power.
Hard starboard.

847
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:56,760
Easy. Here, take this.
Okay, we'll fix you up.

848
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:06,080
Faster! Faster!

849
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:16,480
Compresses!

850
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:27,680
- Out of the way!
- Silence on board!

851
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:32,760
- The port engine belt is loose.
- Maintain full power, Chief!

852
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:36,360
All the power you've got!

853
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:42,280
- Where the hell's he going?
- Due south. The African coastline.

854
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:52,960
Damn it!

855
02:31:55,160 --> 02:32:00,960
- Alarm!
- Ready to dive! All hands forward!

856
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:12,280
- Move! Clear the way!
- 90 metres. Quick!

857
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:16,680
Bow planes zero.
Stern planes up 5. Shut vents.

858
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:21,760
- Bow planes out of action!
- Switch to manual.

859
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:25,480
The bow plane has jammed on dive.

860
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:34,680
Damn it! All engines stop.

861
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:40,960
- All men go aft!
- Hurry!

862
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:49,280
- Move! Pump everything aft.
- Auxiliary pump out of action.

863
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:54,080
- Blow forward tanks!
- Forward tanks blown.

864
02:32:54,280 --> 02:33:01,760
- She's still going down.
- We've got to shed some weight.

865
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:07,480
Keep him quiet!

866
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:13,560
- Main pump out of action!
- Permission to blow?

867
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:16,880
Hard astern full.

868
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:24,880
- No effect.
- All right, blow.

869
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:27,560
Blow forward ballast.

870
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,960
Pull out!

871
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:38,080
Damn you! Pull out!

872
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:43,160
- All you've got, Chief!
- Blow all we've got.

873
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:49,680
Pull up.

874
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:56,760
Christ, please ...

875
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:13,760
We can't hold her.

876
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:21,160
200.

877
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:26,560
210.

878
02:34:29,360 --> 02:34:32,080
220 metres.

879
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:37,280
230. 240.

880
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:53,160
- My God!
- Lord, turn not away from me.

881
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:55,760
Take away all our sins.

882
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:47,480
A shovel full of sand.

883
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:53,960
The gods left a shovel full of sand
to keep us up.

884
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:09,960
280 metres
and she's still in one piece!

885
02:36:55,760 --> 02:37:00,160
Torpedo hatch taking water!

886
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:06,880
- Torpedo hatch taking water!
- Motor room taking water.

887
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:15,360
We're taking water!

888
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:21,360
- What do you need?
- Some timber for sawing.

889
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:28,960
- Exhaust valve okay?
- I need the saw.

890
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:32,560
Give me that flashlight.

891
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:39,360
- I need a wrench.
- Water coming in!

892
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:43,360
Where are the tools?

893
02:37:43,480 --> 02:37:50,360
- Bring me the tools.
- Where are you going?

894
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:55,560
- Switchboard out of action.
- Give me proper damage reports!

895
02:37:55,760 --> 02:38:01,560
- We can't stop the flooding.
- With so much damage, we've had it.

896
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:06,880
- Where's the most damage?
- Below, sir.

897
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:11,360
Check the damage
to the batteries. Quickly!

898
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:17,760
- Tighten that bolt.
- I can't see.

899
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:21,960
Push as hard as you can.
It's stuck tight.

900
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:24,960
I can't wedge it.

901
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:29,680
- Give me the hammer.
- Take the wrench!

902
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:39,160
- Do you need more men aft?
- I'll ask the lieutenant.

903
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:43,080
This damn thing! Hold my light!

904
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:52,160
You stupid son of a pig!
We've got work to do!

905
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:58,960
- Tools from the engine room.
- Where's that damn wrench?

906
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:07,080
- Bring another wrench.
- Hold the light.

907
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:15,080
The bearings have seized.
It just keeps rising!

908
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:18,560
Tighten the seals.
Don't shear the bolts.

909
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:26,160
- The cooling system is leaking.
- Tighten the seals down there.

910
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:36,560
Give me that shoring.
Take it, quickly!

911
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:42,160
It's flooded down here.
Get me the biggest one.

912
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:45,680
That's the biggest we can find.

913
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:48,880
Higher!

914
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:54,480
- Where do we put him?
- Easy, men.

915
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:59,080
Captain,
the chief's looking for you.

916
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:09,760
We're taking water fast.
The cooling sytem is blocked.

917
02:40:09,960 --> 02:40:15,680
The compressors are dislodged.

918
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:19,680
Damn! What about fuel leaks?

919
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:26,080
I can't tell as yet. Many of
the battery cells are cracked.

920
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:28,960
Chlorine gas.

921
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:34,680
It's red. Acid in the bilge.

922
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:39,480
See how many cells have cracked.
Get some battery straps.

923
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:43,680
- Battery straps!
- Get that out of the way.

924
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:49,880
The chief needs battery straps,
make it quick!

925
02:40:56,280 --> 02:41:01,160
- It's still coming in.
- Get me the hammer.

926
02:41:05,360 --> 02:41:08,960
- Here!
- Thanks, Lieutenant.

927
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:16,280
Get it in!

928
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:22,680
- Watch out. Coming through.
- Quiet.

929
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:25,560
Easy.

930
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:35,760
Tell the chief the water is up to
the torpedo hatch and rising.

931
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:44,760
I need light.

932
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:50,560
Who's working on those shaft seals.
Tell them to hurry up.

933
02:41:52,360 --> 02:41:58,880
- 24 battery cells cracked.
- What a hell of a mess.

934
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:04,480
- Battery straps.
- Come here with those.

935
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:10,160
Let's hope these are enough.

936
02:42:12,280 --> 02:42:17,960
Our only chance
is to bridge all the live cells.

937
02:42:20,560 --> 02:42:25,480
- It's no good. I can't see.
- More light.

938
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:31,560
We've got to close the leaks
or it's all over for us.

939
02:42:37,480 --> 02:42:40,560
More to the right.

940
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:53,480
- I need wire to bridge them.
- Wire for the battery cells.

941
02:43:01,880 --> 02:43:06,880
The chief needs wire.
Get moving. Did you hear me?

942
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:12,960
We've got plenty of fancy torpedoes.
Each one is 25,000 marks.

943
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:19,160
All they forget
is 50 pfennigs' worth of old wire!

944
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:25,080
- Now what?
- The draining pump is jammed.

945
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:28,880
- That's great.
- Captain.

946
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:33,960
- Here.
- Better than nothing.

947
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:36,760
Pliers!

948
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:42,160
Captain ...

949
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:51,080
All the leaks have been stopped.

950
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:56,880
Good, Johann.

951
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:02,960
That's good.

952
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:09,480
Now change your wet things, man.

953
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:24,560
We must get rid of the water.
There just has to be a way.

954
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:28,960
Into the control-room bilge
and then outside.

955
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:38,560
- Give it to me.
- Careful, you jerk!

956
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:43,360
- Hoist the bucket.
- Get a move on, boys.

957
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:50,080
Keep the rhythm going.

958
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:55,160
Put your backs into it.

959
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:59,080
Step on it. Quick!

960
02:45:03,480 --> 02:45:09,280
- How's it going, Chief?
- Three more. Starboard side.

961
02:45:19,080 --> 02:45:24,360
- How does it look?
- Only three to go, sir.

962
02:45:35,960 --> 02:45:39,360
Make some room for the chief.

963
02:45:54,480 --> 02:46:00,480
- More hands needed aft.
- Take the men off watch.

964
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:06,960
Captain ... all of our compasses
are out of action.

965
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:13,560
We've lost the sounding gear.
All radio contact is dead.

966
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:22,080
- First-rate condition.
- Can we get up again?

967
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:31,080
Do you think we have a chance, sir?

968
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:39,160
Good question.

969
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:49,280
A bit of air must still be in
the ballast tanks from the blowing.

970
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:58,760
That should help us. We'll use all
the high-pressure air we have left.

971
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:04,560
We'll try.

972
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:14,560
The boat has to be lighter.
We've got to get the water out.

973
02:47:19,360 --> 02:47:22,960
It mustwork!

974
02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:27,080
Come with me aft.

975
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:40,280
The ballast pump and the compressed
air could just force the water out.

976
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:45,960
- The ballast pump?
- We're fixing it.

977
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:54,680
We gamble on one count.
One blast and we ...

978
02:47:54,760 --> 02:48:00,160
- There won't be a second chance.
- When?

979
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:05,560
When the repairs are completed.
In about eight hours, sir.

980
02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:09,960
- CO2 content?
- 1 .8%%%.

981
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:14,480
- Will the oxygen last?
- No.

982
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:23,360
Emergency issue.
All men not working turn in.

983
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:35,680
- Will he pull through?
- It's difficult to say.

984
02:49:51,680 --> 02:49:55,280
He doesn't look too good.

985
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:35,760
Well, Pilgrim ...
is everything okay?

986
02:50:35,960 --> 02:50:39,960
We're getting it under control.
I think we're winning.

987
02:50:43,480 --> 02:50:49,280
- How is it looking aft?
- We've done what we can, sir.

988
02:50:50,480 --> 02:50:53,960
I guess it's time
I looked things over.

989
02:51:25,080 --> 02:51:28,080
You should be careful.

990
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:53,280
- Can you make it?
- We'll make it.

991
02:51:54,760 --> 02:52:01,280
- How does it look?
- We'll soon be running.

992
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:15,680
- How's it going?
- Two bearings to be changed.

993
02:53:08,480 --> 02:53:12,280
Chief ...

994
02:53:18,360 --> 02:53:22,280
Do you want some glucose?

995
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:27,280
How about some apple juice?

996
02:53:59,480 --> 02:54:05,160
They were crazy,
ordering us through the strait.

997
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:08,680
It was going to go wrong ...

998
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:16,280
He knew it.

999
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:19,760
The old man, he knew it.

1000
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:30,680
From the moment that radio signal
came through, he realized the risk.

1001
02:54:33,360 --> 02:54:39,480
That's the reason
he ordered us ashore.

1002
02:54:43,560 --> 02:54:47,160
He knew there was very little hope.

1003
02:55:01,880 --> 02:55:08,480
He tried to fool us.
"An easy trick," he said.

1004
02:55:11,960 --> 02:55:16,160
"Dive and drift with the current."

1005
02:55:20,280 --> 02:55:24,480
What a clever trick.

1006
02:55:25,080 --> 02:55:29,160
But it has to work.

1007
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:37,880
Will we ever get out of this?

1008
02:55:46,280 --> 02:55:49,760
I really don't know.

1009
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:41,960
- I'm sorry.
- You think it's hopeless now?

1010
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:48,680
It's been 15 hours.

1011
02:56:55,280 --> 02:56:58,760
We'll never do it.

1012
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:20,960
I'm sorry.

1013
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:32,960
They made us all dream
for this day.

1014
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:41,080
To be fearless and proud and alone.

1015
02:57:41,960 --> 02:57:47,560
They told us it would be
the test of our manhood.

1016
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:55,680
To need no one and sacrific all
for the fatherland and courage.

1017
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:02,760
Is that not the way
they said it all?

1018
02:58:05,680 --> 02:58:11,480
I just want someone to be with.

1019
02:58:16,560 --> 02:58:20,760
The only thing I feel is afraid.

1020
02:59:08,160 --> 02:59:11,480
Situation report, sir.

1021
02:59:15,160 --> 02:59:19,760
The boat is in order.
The pump is clear.

1022
02:59:21,080 --> 02:59:27,880
Water in the trimming tanks can
be blown out with compressed air.

1023
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:34,280
The compass is in order.
Echo sounder clear.

1024
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:38,960
Maybe we'll be okay.

1025
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:52,680
Good, Chief.

1026
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:58,080
Good.

1027
03:00:05,960 --> 03:00:09,080
Go and take a rest now.

1028
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:18,960
Just a few small problems left, sir.

1029
03:01:02,680 --> 03:01:10,680
You have to have good men.
Good men, all of them.

1030
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:17,360
Now listen ...

1031
03:01:17,480 --> 03:01:24,480
We're going to blow out the water
and try to get out of the sand.

1032
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:33,480
If we make it to the surface,
it could still get pretty rough.

1033
03:01:34,560 --> 03:01:37,960
The traffic's heavy up there.

1034
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:47,280
Pray the engines start
so we can get out of this mess.

1035
03:01:48,160 --> 03:01:55,280
With the condition the boat is in
we'll head straight for La Rochelle.

1036
03:01:57,360 --> 03:02:02,160
If we make it,
it's half a bottle of beer for each.

1037
03:02:06,360 --> 03:02:10,360
There's one thing on our side ...

1038
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:14,960
They won't be expecting us.

1039
03:02:20,760 --> 03:02:23,760
Well, men ...

1040
03:02:24,760 --> 03:02:28,880
- All set?
- Aye-aye, sir.

1041
03:02:31,160 --> 03:02:35,080
- Surface contacts?
- Nothing near, Captain.

1042
03:02:35,160 --> 03:02:40,560
Get ready to surface.
Stand by escape gear. Red light on.

1043
03:02:41,480 --> 03:02:44,560
Battle stations.

1044
03:03:07,280 --> 03:03:11,160
- Let her blow.
- Blow all tanks.

1045
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:23,960
She's rising.

1046
03:04:24,880 --> 03:04:28,960
- Easy.
- Starboard planes down 15.

1047
03:04:37,280 --> 03:04:43,360
- 270 metres!
- First watch, stand by.

1048
03:04:43,480 --> 03:04:46,160
260 metres.

1049
03:04:51,560 --> 03:04:54,560
250 metres.

1050
03:05:01,880 --> 03:05:04,760
240 metres.

1051
03:05:09,360 --> 03:05:12,360
230 metres.

1052
03:05:16,760 --> 03:05:19,360
220.

1053
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:14,480
Start up engines?

1054
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:23,960
- Go ahead. Both main engines.
- This is it, boys.

1055
03:06:32,360 --> 03:06:35,560
Yeah.

1056
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:51,880
They're going!

1057
03:06:52,080 --> 03:06:56,760
I've never heard such sweet music
in all my life.

1058
03:06:59,360 --> 03:07:02,360
They're running!

1059
03:07:16,160 --> 03:07:19,760
They won't catch us this time.
Not this time!

1060
03:07:23,160 --> 03:07:28,280
Keep going and get us back.
That's an order!

1061
03:07:28,360 --> 03:07:32,080
Right full rudder.
Come to 320.

1062
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:34,960
Jesus that's good!

1063
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:44,960
They haven't spotted us.
They're snoring in their bunks.

1064
03:07:48,360 --> 03:07:53,960
They're drinking in the bar.
Celebrating our sinking!

1065
03:07:56,680 --> 03:08:00,360
Not yet, my friends!

1066
03:08:38,080 --> 03:08:43,280
- Boys, here's to home!
- And an end to the war.

1067
03:09:16,680 --> 03:09:20,080
Let's pray the engines hold out.

1068
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:27,160
With a bit of luck ...

1069
03:09:29,560 --> 03:09:33,160
... we'll make it back home.

1070
03:09:36,880 --> 03:09:43,160
Third U-boat flotilla
welcome back home. Three cheers.

1071
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:16,160
Both engines stop.
Stern line out.

1072
03:10:41,080 --> 03:10:47,480
- Thank you, Hinrich.
- It's okay. The sun is shining.

1073
03:10:48,360 --> 03:10:51,960
Another two metres.

1074
03:10:53,160 --> 03:10:56,160
Okay, we have it.

1075
03:11:02,480 --> 03:11:06,360
- Nearly there.
- Wounded man coming ashore.

1076
03:12:31,360 --> 03:12:34,280
Get under cover!

1077
03:13:06,760 --> 03:13:11,880
- Bring a medic!
- Over here.

1078
03:13:11,960 --> 03:13:15,680
Medic!

1079
03:15:17,680 --> 03:15:27,680
