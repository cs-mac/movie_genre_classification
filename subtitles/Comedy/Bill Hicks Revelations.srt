1
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,159
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:34,024
You know, I bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

3
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:36,237
If I wanted to.

4
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,592
You know, kiddo...

5
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,658
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

6
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,775
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

7
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:59,373
We, maybe towards
those other jokers.

8
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:02,768
But not you.

9
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:07,306
No, kiddo.

10
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,233
At this moment...

11
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:17,608
This is me at my most
masochistic.

12
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:21,512
Bill, it's your baby.

13
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:30,290
Coming!

14
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:32,875
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

15
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,072
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

16
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,831
Got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

17
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,090
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

18
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,062
Come on.
Bring it on.

19
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,197
Mommy, I'm home.

20
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:34,729
Hey, baby.

21
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:36,626
How was school?

22
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:41,451
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

23
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:43,378
Oh.

24
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,832
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

25
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:48,176
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

26
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,829
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

27
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,972
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

28
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:57,234
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

29
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:05,935
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

30
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:07,890
Hi, honey.

31
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,614
I'm ****

32
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:10,795
What's your name?

33
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,332
Her name is Nikki.

34
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:17,930
Nikki.

35
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:21,489
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

36
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,812
How old are you, Nikki?

37
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:31,858
Nikki, **** asked you
a question.

38
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,898
I'm 4.

39
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,077
4 years old, eh?

40
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:40,946
You know,
I had a little girl once.

41
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:44,107
She'd be about 4 now.

42
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:50,641
Now, baby, me and mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

43
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:51,951
to talk about.

44
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,066
You can go in your room.

45
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,954
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

46
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,393
Okay?

47
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,755
Nikkia!

48
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:03,503
In your room.
Now.

49
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,711
You want some coffee?

50
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,852
Yeah. Sure.

51
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,270
This Pasadena homemaker's name

52
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,387
Is Jeanne Bell.

53
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,947
Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.

54
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,671
But back when we were
acquainted, Four years ago,

55
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,747
her nanne was Vernita Green.

56
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,308
Her code name was Copperhead.

57
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,103
Mine, Black Mamba.

58
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,666
Do you have a towel?

59
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:45,385
Yeah.

60
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,678
Thanks.

61
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,722
You still take cream and sugar?

62
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:52,723
Yeah.

63
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:58,318
So suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

64
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:00,657
You suppose correctly.

65
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:02,829
Look, bitch, I need to know

66
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,551
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

67
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,562
You can relax for now.

68
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:12,202
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

69
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:14,764
That's being more rational

70
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:17,072
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

71
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,330
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

72
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:23,284
Not rationality.

73
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:29,106
Look.

74
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:32,521
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

75
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:34,985
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

76
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:37,897
You have every right
to want to get even.

77
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,361
No, no, no, no, no.

78
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:41,451
No.

79
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:45,168
To get even, even Stephen,

80
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:51,401
would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

81
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:56,047
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

82
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,385
That would be even, Vernita.

83
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:00,492
That'd be about square.

84
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:03,498
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

85
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,165
But I can't.

86
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:09,203
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

87
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,065
Oh, great.
I don't care.

88
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,928
Be that as it may,

89
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:17,898
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

90
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:22,412
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

91
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:26,096
Bitch, you can stop right there.

92
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,626
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

93
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:29,969
before the eyes of your daughter

94
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:32,491
does not mean that parading her
around in front of me

95
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:35,499
is gonna inspire sympathy.

96
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:38,420
You and I have
unfinished business.

97
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:40,557
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

98
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:42,057
in the subsequent four years,

99
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:46,158
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

100
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,514
So when do we do this?

101
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,660
It all depends.

102
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:54,220
When do you want to die?

103
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:57,042
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

104
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:58,318
How about tonight, bitch?

105
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,625
Splendid.
Where?

106
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,863
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach our little league

107
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,787
about a mile from here.

108
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:06,761
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

109
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:10,698
dressed all in black,
your hair in a back stocking.

110
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,489
And we have us a knife fight.

111
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:15,498
We won't be bothered.

112
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:20,274
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

113
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,736
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

114
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:32,178
with an edged weapon.

115
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:34,317
Fuck you, bitch.

116
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,657
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

117
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:40,368
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

118
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,213
Black Mamba.

119
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:45,869
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

120
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,889
Weapon of choice?

121
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,583
If you want to stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

122
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,618
Very funny, bitch.

123
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,375
Very funny!

124
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,547
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

125
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,674
For that, I'm sorry.

126
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:01,103
But you can take my word for it.

127
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,442
Your mother had it coming.

128
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:26,763
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

129
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:32,111
I'll be waiting.

130
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:38,573
For those regarded as warriors...

131
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:41,200
When engaged in combat...

132
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:46,154
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

133
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:53,420
Suppress a human emotion and compassion...

134
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:04,555
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

135
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:16,080
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

136
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:42,032
Come on out to Dallas.

137
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,646
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

138
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,888
And next, we got some record.

139
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:50,607
Very own wildman,
Charlie Feathers.

140
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:29,587
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

141
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:31,922
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

142
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,940
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

143
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:40,404
Give me a figure.

144
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,378
Nine dead bodies.

145
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:44,941
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

146
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:47,828
Bride. Groom.

147
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:49,518
Reverend.

148
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,142
Reverend's wife.

149
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:56,075
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

150
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,320
It would appear
somebody objected to this

151
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,625
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

152
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:08,755
Good gravy, Marie.

153
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:15,439
What'd I tell you, Pop?

154
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:18,641
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

155
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,360
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

156
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:22,890
You're in a house of worship.

157
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,339
Sorry, Pop.

158
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,944
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

159
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:33,682
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

160
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,237
Four, maybe five strong.

161
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,251
How can you tell?

162
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:41,194
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

163
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:44,882
This ain't no
squirrey amateur.

164
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:48,332
This is the work of a salty dog.

165
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:51,024
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

166
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:54,257
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

167
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:57,456
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

168
00:17:57,525 --> 00:18:01,300
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

169
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,732
Who's the bride?

170
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,234
I don't know.

171
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:17,771
The name
on the marriage certificate

172
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,747
is Arlene Machiavelli.

173
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:22,577
That's a fake.

174
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,271
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

175
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:25,770
on account of the dress.

176
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:28,496
You can tell she was pregnant.

177
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,092
Man would have to be a mad dog

178
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:33,907
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

179
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:37,354
Look at her.

180
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:44,340
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

181
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,023
She's a little
blood-splattered angel.

182
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,174
Son Number One?

183
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:53,456
Yeah?

184
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:57,868
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

185
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:29,139
I might never have liked you.

186
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,164
Point in fact, I despise you.

187
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:38,543
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

188
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:44,525
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

189
00:21:44,598 --> 00:21:47,729
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

190
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:51,376
My gift to you.

191
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:59,093
For fuck's sake.

192
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:03,663
Hello, Bill.

193
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:07,217
What's her condition?

194
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,391
Comatose.

195
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:11,596
Where is she?

196
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,801
I'm standing over her right now.

197
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,877
That's my girl.

198
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:22,131
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

199
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:23,278
What?

200
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,812
We owe her better than that.

201
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,577
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

202
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,239
Will you keep your voice down?

203
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,099
You don't owe her shit!

204
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,173
May I say one thing?

205
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:34,002
Speak.

206
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,977
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

207
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:38,901
But you didn't kill her.

208
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,722
And I put a bullet in her head.

209
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,987
But her heart
just kept on beating.

210
00:22:44,054 --> 00:22:45,428
Now, you saw that yourself

211
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:50,197
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

212
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:54,509
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

213
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:59,820
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

214
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:01,749
But one thing we won't do

215
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:06,004
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

216
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,844
and kill her in her sleep.

217
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,430
And the reason
we won't do that thing

218
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:17,521
is because that thing
would lower us.

219
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,532
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

220
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,674
I guess.

221
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:25,131
Do you really have to guess?

222
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:27,116
No.

223
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,965
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

224
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,354
Come on home, honey.

225
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:37,580
Affirmative.

226
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,879
I love you very much.

227
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,023
I love you, too.

228
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:47,180
Bye-bye.

229
00:23:58,007 --> 00:24:00,428
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

230
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:01,931
Hmm?

231
00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:06,414
Word of advice, shithead.

232
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,389
Don't you ever wake up.

233
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:49,267
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

234
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:52,302
Bill, it's your baby.

235
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:54,962
Oh, my baby.

236
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:23,373
Four years.

237
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,222
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

238
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:55,757
You getting your freak on
or what?

239
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,871
Oh, yeah, boy.

240
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,951
20, 40, 60, 75.

241
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,910
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.

242
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:07,535
Rule number one.

243
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:08,621
No punching her.

244
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,386
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

245
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:12,146
or less some teeth, jig's up.

246
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:14,604
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

247
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,370
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

248
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:19,821
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

249
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:22,742
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

250
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,905
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

251
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:28,561
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

252
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:31,697
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

253
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:33,775
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

254
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:35,276
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

255
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:36,878
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

256
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,477
I'll Be back in 20.

257
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:41,264
Yeah.

258
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:43,190
Oh, shit.

259
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:45,711
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

260
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:48,171
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

261
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:51,509
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

262
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,511
Bon appetit, good buddy.

263
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:06,486
Oh, yeah.

264
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:08,821
Oh, God damn.

265
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,302
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

266
00:28:32,151 --> 00:28:33,428
Oh.

267
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,789
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

268
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:02,546
Coming in, ready or not.

269
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,168
Hey, buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

270
00:29:06,423 --> 00:29:07,884
Whoa.

271
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:27,056
Aaaah!

272
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:37,870
Where's Bill?

273
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:40,463
Where's Bill?

274
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:42,833
Please stop hitting me.

275
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:43,983
Where's Bill?

276
00:29:45,591 --> 00:29:47,020
I don't know who Bill is!

277
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:48,503
Bullshit!

278
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:59,633
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

279
00:29:59,703 --> 00:30:02,900
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

280
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,625
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

281
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:08,819
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

282
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,353
Your name is Buck.

283
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:16,180
Right?

284
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:19,215
And you came here to fuck.

285
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:20,400
Right?

286
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:21,998
Wait a minute.
Wait.

287
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,749
"Pussy Wagon. "

288
00:30:48,824 --> 00:30:50,679
You fucker.

289
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:19,598
Texas. Okay.

290
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:03,537
Wiggle your big toe.

291
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:09,876
Wiggle your big toe.

292
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:19,981
Wiggle your big toe.

293
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,441
Wiggle your big toe.

294
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:33,681
Wiggle your big toe.

295
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:36,054
As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,

296
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,542
trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...

297
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,176
Wiggle your big toe.

298
00:33:40,248 --> 00:33:44,143
...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.

299
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:46,999
And the dicks responsible.

300
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:53,813
Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.

301
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:57,265
When fortune smiles
on something

302
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,703
as violent and ugly as revenge,

303
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:03,598
It seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,

304
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:05,614
you're doing his will.

305
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:08,176
At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,

306
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:10,158
the first name
on my death list,

307
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:14,007
O- Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.

308
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:16,407
But when one
manages the difficult task

309
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:19,058
of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,

310
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:22,227
one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?

311
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:38,256
O- Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base

312
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:40,598
In Tokyo, Japan.

313
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:43,980
The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American Army brat

314
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:47,471
made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.

315
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,300
It was at that age
she witnessed

316
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:51,092
the death of her parents
at the hands

317
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:56,758
of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.

318
00:35:22,552 --> 00:35:23,959
Hyah!

319
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:02,224
Hmm.

320
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:09,750
Hmm.

321
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:45,039
Oh.

322
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,105
Mommy.

323
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:14,264
She swore revenge.

324
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:19,283
Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.

325
00:39:21,113 --> 00:39:25,074
At 11, she got her revenge.

326
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,477
Look at me, Matsumoto...

327
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:36,049
...take a good look at my face.

328
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:39,855
Look at my eyes.

329
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:44,851
Look at my mouth.

330
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:47,736
Do I look familiar?

331
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:51,952
Do I look like somebody...

332
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:54,098
you murdered?!

333
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:08,664
By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.

334
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:56,786
At 25, she did her part
in the killing

335
00:41:56,857 --> 00:42:01,811
of nine innocent people,
Including my unborn daughter,

336
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:06,038
In a small wedding chapel
In El Paso, Texas.

337
00:42:06,105 --> 00:42:13,492
But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.

338
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:15,984
She should have killed 10.

339
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,856
However, before satisfaction
would be mine,

340
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:22,864
first things first.

341
00:42:22,938 --> 00:42:25,752
Wiggle your big toe.

342
00:42:32,377 --> 00:42:34,712
Hard part's over.

343
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:38,390
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

344
00:43:11,514 --> 00:43:13,521
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

345
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:15,798
Okinawa.
One-way.

346
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,127
Hi.

347
00:43:43,194 --> 00:43:45,016
Welcome...

348
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,352
Welcome.

349
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:54,041
You English?

350
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:56,310
Almost.
American.

351
00:43:56,378 --> 00:43:59,990
American.
Welcome, American.

352
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:01,302
Domo.

353
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:04,087
My English very good.

354
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:07,285
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?

355
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:08,248
No, no.

356
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:11,129
Just a few words learned
since yesterday.

357
00:44:11,194 --> 00:44:13,650
Um, may I sit at the bar?

358
00:44:13,722 --> 00:44:16,952
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.

359
00:44:17,754 --> 00:44:19,859
Oh.

360
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,647
What other words did you learn?

361
00:44:22,714 --> 00:44:24,722
Oh, just a minute.

362
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:28,918
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

363
00:44:29,178 --> 00:44:32,026
I'm watching my soap operas.

364
00:44:33,114 --> 00:44:35,024
Lazy bastard...

365
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:37,361
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!

366
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:39,059
The tea's hot.

367
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,789
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

368
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:42,168
Shut up!

369
00:44:42,234 --> 00:44:45,049
Get your ass out here!

370
00:44:45,114 --> 00:44:47,001
Uh, excuse me.

371
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:52,248
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

372
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,208
Oh, let's see.

373
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,314
Um, "arigato."

374
00:44:55,386 --> 00:44:57,753
"Arigato."
Good!

375
00:44:57,818 --> 00:45:01,779
Um, already said "donno,"
right?

376
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,184
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:05,265
"Konn-itch-iwa."

378
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:06,996
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

379
00:45:07,066 --> 00:45:08,757
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

380
00:45:08,826 --> 00:45:10,419
Konnichi wa.
Pease repeat.

381
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,603
Konnichi wa.

382
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,657
Perfect.

383
00:45:12,731 --> 00:45:14,673
Good, good, good.

384
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:17,168
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

385
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:18,671
Oh, you're making fun of me!

386
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:21,616
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

387
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,690
Pronounciation very good.

388
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:29,170
You say arigato
like we say arigato.

389
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,153
Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.

390
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:36,568
Mmm-hmm.

391
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:39,056
You should learn Japanese.

392
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,985
Very easy.

393
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,938
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

394
00:45:43,003 --> 00:45:45,075
Most difficult.

395
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:47,928
But you have Japanese tongue.

396
00:45:50,171 --> 00:45:51,665
Okay, okay.

397
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:58,327
Oh.
Oh, my God.

398
00:45:58,394 --> 00:46:03,991
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?
Hurry up... goddammit!

399
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:11,701
Lazy oaf...

400
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:18,033
What d'ya want?

401
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:19,953
Beg your pardon?

402
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,158
Uh, drink.

403
00:46:23,226 --> 00:46:24,436
Oh, yes.

404
00:46:24,506 --> 00:46:26,841
A bottle of warm sake, please.

405
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:28,434
Warm sake?

406
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:30,514
Very good!

407
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:31,994
One warm sake!

408
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:35,092
Sake? In the middle of the day?

409
00:46:35,547 --> 00:46:39,671
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

410
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:42,521
How come I always have to get the sake?

411
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:43,634
You listen we...

412
00:46:44,123 --> 00:46:47,287
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

413
00:46:47,355 --> 00:46:49,078
If this were the military,

414
00:46:49,146 --> 00:46:52,724
I'd be General by now.

415
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:55,445
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

416
00:46:55,514 --> 00:46:59,256
If you were General, I'd be emperor,

417
00:46:59,323 --> 00:47:01,657
and you'd still get the sake -

418
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:03,828
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

419
00:47:03,899 --> 00:47:04,914
Do you understand?

420
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:06,841
I'm not bad, okay? I shaved my head.

421
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,794
Do you understand me?

422
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,523
Sorry.

423
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:18,552
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

424
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:19,993
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

425
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:23,125
What brings you to Okinawa?

426
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:24,918
Came to see a man.

427
00:47:24,987 --> 00:47:27,572
Oh, yeah.

428
00:47:27,643 --> 00:47:30,294
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

429
00:47:30,363 --> 00:47:31,890
Not quite.

430
00:47:31,963 --> 00:47:33,751
Not friend?

431
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:35,160
Never met him.

432
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:37,114
Never?

433
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:38,870
Who is he?

434
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,564
May I ask?

435
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:44,309
Hattori Hanzo.

436
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,390
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

437
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:02,261
I need Japanese steel.

438
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,226
Why do you need Japanese steel?

439
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:11,538
I have vermin to kill.

440
00:48:14,779 --> 00:48:20,311
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

441
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:24,592
Huge.

442
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:50,707
May I?

443
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,438
You may.

444
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:56,624
Wait.

445
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,121
Try the second one down.

446
00:50:49,915 --> 00:50:51,857
Funny.

447
00:50:51,931 --> 00:50:54,200
You like samurai swords.

448
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:59,477
I like baseball.

449
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:09,521
I wanted to show you these.

450
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:11,510
However...

451
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:15,767
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

452
00:51:16,476 --> 00:51:21,080
...I no longer make instruments of death.

453
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:23,889
What I have here...

454
00:51:24,923 --> 00:51:30,193
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

455
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,158
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

456
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,191
...I have retired.

457
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,915
Then give me one of these.

458
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:55,224
These are not for sale.

459
00:51:56,603 --> 00:51:58,937
I didn't say "sell me."

460
00:51:59,004 --> 00:52:00,564
I said "give me."

461
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:05,715
Why should I help you?

462
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:10,774
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

463
00:52:12,987 --> 00:52:16,283
And considering the student,

464
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:21,236
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

465
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,046
You can sleep here.

466
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,085
It will take me a month...

467
00:53:22,651 --> 00:53:23,993
...to make the sword.

468
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,958
I suggest you spend it practicing.

469
00:54:52,764 --> 00:54:54,619
I've completed doing...

470
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,053
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

471
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,813
...to never do again.

472
00:55:08,412 --> 00:55:12,154
I have created "something that kills people."

473
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:19,319
And in that purpose, was a success.

474
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,275
I've done this because philosophically,

475
00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:30,769
I am sympathetic to your aim.

476
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:39,100
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

477
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:43,537
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

478
00:55:43,613 --> 00:55:46,646
...God will be cut.

479
00:55:58,684 --> 00:56:00,855
Yellow-haired warrior...

480
00:56:01,116 --> 00:56:03,221
Go.

481
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:04,786
Domo.

482
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:29,080
It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,

483
00:56:29,148 --> 00:56:31,035
that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny

484
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:33,075
financially
and philosophically in her

485
00:56:33,148 --> 00:56:35,385
Shakespearean-in-magnitude
power struggle

486
00:56:35,453 --> 00:56:36,860
with the other yakuza clans

487
00:56:36,924 --> 00:56:41,015
over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.

488
00:56:41,084 --> 00:56:43,026
When the final sword
was sheathed,

489
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,134
It was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse...

490
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:50,937
...the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.

491
00:56:52,988 --> 00:56:54,843
The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,

492
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:57,494
who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"

493
00:56:57,565 --> 00:57:01,339
is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.

494
00:57:01,405 --> 00:57:05,398
The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.

495
00:57:05,468 --> 00:57:08,567
Another former protégée
of Bill's.

496
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:13,014
The young girl
in the school-girl uniform

497
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:18,355
is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.

498
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:21,527
Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,

499
00:57:21,596 --> 00:57:24,214
she makes up for in madness.

500
00:57:24,284 --> 00:57:25,910
Do you like Ferraris?

501
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,730
Ferrari... italian trash.

502
00:57:41,117 --> 00:57:42,327
Do you want to screw me?

503
00:57:43,997 --> 00:57:47,346
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

504
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:49,660
Yes.

505
00:57:53,661 --> 00:57:54,871
How 'bout now, big boy?

506
00:57:56,093 --> 00:57:58,515
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

507
00:58:00,893 --> 00:58:01,883
...or is it I...

508
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:04,120
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

509
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,123
See what I mean?

510
00:58:08,509 --> 00:58:12,851
The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,

511
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:17,202
the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.

512
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:21,143
And just in case
you were wondering

513
00:58:21,212 --> 00:58:25,009
how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American

514
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:29,722
become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan,

515
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:31,251
I'll tell you.

516
00:58:31,325 --> 00:58:33,975
The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality

517
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:36,630
came up before the council
only once.

518
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:41,589
The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.

519
00:58:41,661 --> 00:58:43,668
The man who seems bound
and determined

520
00:58:43,741 --> 00:58:46,458
to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.

521
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:49,820
And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...

522
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:54,513
Boss Tanaka!

523
00:58:55,101 --> 00:58:56,246
What's the meaning of this outburst?

524
00:58:56,317 --> 00:58:58,073
This is a time for celebration!

525
00:58:58,621 --> 00:59:01,304
And what exactly are we celebrating?

526
00:59:02,781 --> 00:59:05,050
The perversion of our illustrious council?

527
00:59:06,973 --> 00:59:09,843
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

528
00:59:09,916 --> 00:59:11,127
I will not tolerate this!

529
00:59:11,197 --> 00:59:13,269
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

530
00:59:14,397 --> 00:59:19,448
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

531
00:59:25,117 --> 00:59:26,459
My father...

532
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:28,148
...along with yours,

533
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:29,650
and along with yours,
started this council.

534
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,187
And while...

535
00:59:32,253 --> 00:59:33,682
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

536
00:59:33,757 --> 00:59:35,350
...they weep in the afterlife...

537
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:36,859
- Shut up!

538
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:39,513
...over the perversion committed today!

539
00:59:40,253 --> 00:59:42,675
Outrageous!

540
00:59:43,357 --> 00:59:45,430
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

541
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:46,449
Bastard!

542
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:48,599
Fuck face!

543
00:59:49,021 --> 00:59:50,680
Gentlemen.

544
00:59:52,637 --> 00:59:58,005
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

545
00:59:59,485 --> 01:00:03,347
By all means, allow him to express it.

546
01:00:04,382 --> 01:00:08,757
Speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

547
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:11,610
...which I love...

548
01:00:12,414 --> 01:00:13,820
...more than my own children,

549
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:19,449
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

550
01:00:26,141 --> 01:00:28,476
Aah! Aah!

551
01:00:38,973 --> 01:00:45,432
So that you understand how serious I am...

552
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,607
...I'm going to say this in English.

553
01:00:47,709 --> 01:00:48,603
Huh!

554
01:01:00,925 --> 01:01:03,161
As your leader...

555
01:01:03,229 --> 01:01:04,658
I encourage you
from time to time,

556
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:09,206
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

557
01:01:09,277 --> 01:01:10,171
If you're unconvinced

558
01:01:10,237 --> 01:01:12,571
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

559
01:01:12,638 --> 01:01:13,783
tell me so.

560
01:01:13,854 --> 01:01:15,348
But allow me to convince you.

561
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,462
And promise you,
right here and now,

562
01:01:17,534 --> 01:01:20,949
no subject will ever be taboo.

563
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:24,153
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

564
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:28,179
The price you pay

565
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:31,036
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

566
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:34,898
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

567
01:01:34,974 --> 01:01:37,275
Just like this fucker here.

568
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:42,037
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

569
01:01:42,109 --> 01:01:46,648
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

570
01:01:48,669 --> 01:01:50,163
Didn't think so.

571
01:01:53,373 --> 01:01:56,123
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

572
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,579
One ticket to Tokyo please.

573
01:04:26,974 --> 01:04:28,184
Moshi moshi.

574
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:01,307
Hey!

575
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:04,828
- Hey, yeah!
- Hey, yeah!

576
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,470
Gogo.

577
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:11,482
Yeah! Whoo!

578
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,989
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

579
01:08:56,063 --> 01:08:57,689
They demand ridiculous things.

580
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,930
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

581
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:00,795
What's gonna happen?

582
01:09:00,926 --> 01:09:02,268
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

583
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:04,122
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

584
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,019
No, I don't want that.

585
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:52,278
Yes, it's me.

586
01:09:56,383 --> 01:09:59,547
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

587
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,949
Who do you remind me of?

588
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:19,573
Charlie Brown!

589
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,391
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

590
01:10:23,424 --> 01:10:24,339
Charlie Brown.

591
01:10:24,607 --> 01:10:26,036
Four pepperoni pizzas.

592
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:27,544
That's not on our menu...

593
01:10:27,743 --> 01:10:29,848
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

594
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:33,558
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

595
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:36,923
O- Ren Ishii!

596
01:10:38,111 --> 01:10:41,460
You and I have unfinished business!

597
01:12:06,879 --> 01:12:09,301
Charlie Brown, beat it.

598
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:17,497
Miki.

599
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,958
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

600
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:09,046
So, O-Ren, anymore subordinates
for me to kill?

601
01:14:10,528 --> 01:14:11,869
Hi!

602
01:14:13,472 --> 01:14:14,366
Gogo, right?

603
01:14:16,096 --> 01:14:17,722
Bingo.

604
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:19,548
And you're Black Mamba.

605
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:24,439
Our reputations precede us.

606
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:27,004
Don't they?

607
01:14:28,704 --> 01:14:33,755
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

608
01:14:34,848 --> 01:14:37,336
But I beg you.

609
01:14:37,408 --> 01:14:38,968
Walk away.

610
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,353
You call that begging?

611
01:14:53,472 --> 01:14:55,861
You can beg better than that.

612
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,832
Aah!

613
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,167
Aah!

614
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:01,115
Aah!

615
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:03,513
Is that what I think it is?

616
01:18:03,584 --> 01:18:06,202
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

617
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:13,308
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

618
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,931
Silly rabbit.

619
01:18:16,576 --> 01:18:17,372
Trix are for...

620
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,488
Kids.

621
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:23,765
Hyaaaaaaah!

622
01:19:30,657 --> 01:19:31,671
Hyah!

623
01:19:44,353 --> 01:19:46,491
Aaaaaaaaahh!

624
01:20:03,936 --> 01:20:04,984
Aaahh!

625
01:21:09,313 --> 01:21:10,719
Aaaaahhh!

626
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:23,135
Aaah!

627
01:24:31,362 --> 01:24:35,869
This is what you get
for fucking around with yakuzas!

628
01:24:35,938 --> 01:24:37,628
Go home to your mother!

629
01:25:34,306 --> 01:25:36,957
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

630
01:25:37,026 --> 01:25:39,197
...take them with you!

631
01:25:41,218 --> 01:25:42,396
However...

632
01:25:43,714 --> 01:25:47,511
...leave the limbs you've lost.

633
01:25:48,673 --> 01:25:51,903
They belong to me now.

634
01:25:56,162 --> 01:25:58,911
Except you, Sofie!

635
01:25:59,586 --> 01:26:02,750
You stay right where you are.

636
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:56,311
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

637
01:27:00,834 --> 01:27:02,394
Where was it made?

638
01:27:04,098 --> 01:27:05,659
Okinawa.

639
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:10,240
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

640
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:13,281
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

641
01:27:13,346 --> 01:27:14,590
YOU LIE!

642
01:27:22,562 --> 01:27:24,023
Mmm-hmm.

643
01:27:26,978 --> 01:27:29,182
Swords however, never get tired.

644
01:27:30,466 --> 01:27:33,783
Hope you've saved your energy.

645
01:27:37,314 --> 01:27:38,459
If you haven't...

646
01:27:40,514 --> 01:27:42,424
...you might not last five minutes.

647
01:27:44,386 --> 01:27:46,491
But as last looks go,

648
01:27:47,714 --> 01:27:50,169
you could do worse.

649
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:26,010
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

650
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:31,073
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

651
01:30:33,987 --> 01:30:36,987
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

652
01:31:06,147 --> 01:31:07,554
Attack me...

653
01:31:08,803 --> 01:31:10,297
...with everything you have.

654
01:32:03,299 --> 01:32:05,982
For ridiculing you earlier...

655
01:32:08,419 --> 01:32:10,274
...I apologize.

656
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:19,611
Accepted.

657
01:32:35,555 --> 01:32:36,417
Ready?

658
01:32:41,316 --> 01:32:42,428
Come on.

659
01:33:14,308 --> 01:33:22,818
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

660
01:35:23,812 --> 01:35:25,219
Sofie.

661
01:35:25,891 --> 01:35:27,680
Sofie.

662
01:35:27,748 --> 01:35:29,504
My Sofie.

663
01:35:29,572 --> 01:35:31,645
I'm so sorry.

664
01:35:34,852 --> 01:35:38,234
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

665
01:35:38,308 --> 01:35:40,163
No more of that.

666
01:35:40,228 --> 01:35:41,919
But still...

667
01:35:41,988 --> 01:35:44,508
But still nothing.

668
01:35:45,988 --> 01:35:49,119
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

669
01:35:49,187 --> 01:35:52,449
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

670
01:35:53,188 --> 01:35:55,905
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

671
01:35:55,972 --> 01:35:58,914
The first reason is information.

672
01:35:58,948 --> 01:36:01,667
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

673
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:03,391
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

674
01:36:04,612 --> 01:36:08,703
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

675
01:36:08,772 --> 01:36:12,700
And every time
you don't give me answers,

676
01:36:12,772 --> 01:36:15,260
I'm gonna cut something off.

677
01:36:15,972 --> 01:36:21,601
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

678
01:36:22,212 --> 01:36:23,936
Give me your other arm!

679
01:36:26,852 --> 01:36:31,359
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

680
01:36:31,428 --> 01:36:32,540
If you had to guess...

681
01:36:32,612 --> 01:36:33,506
What they've been doing.

682
01:36:33,572 --> 01:36:34,717
Why she left you alive...

683
01:36:34,788 --> 01:36:36,643
And where I can find them.

684
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,530
What would be your guess?

685
01:36:40,452 --> 01:36:43,267
Guessing won't be necessary.

686
01:36:43,332 --> 01:36:45,121
She informed me.

687
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:51,130
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

688
01:36:51,908 --> 01:36:53,250
As I said before,

689
01:36:53,316 --> 01:36:57,756
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

690
01:36:57,828 --> 01:37:03,043
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

691
01:37:03,108 --> 01:37:06,719
everything that happened
here tonight.

692
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:09,920
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

693
01:37:09,988 --> 01:37:13,436
by witnessing
your deformed body.

694
01:37:13,508 --> 01:37:17,600
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

695
01:37:17,668 --> 01:37:20,570
I want him to know what I know.

696
01:37:20,644 --> 01:37:24,222
I want him to know
I want him to know.

697
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:27,043
And I want them all to know

698
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:32,825
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

699
01:37:56,036 --> 01:38:00,346
Revenge is never a straight line.

700
01:38:03,492 --> 01:38:05,118
It's a forest.

701
01:38:06,372 --> 01:38:09,154
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

702
01:38:10,245 --> 01:38:13,147
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

703
01:38:16,484 --> 01:38:20,608
That woman deserves her revenge.

704
01:38:25,284 --> 01:38:29,474
And we deserve to die.

705
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:36,482
She must suffer
to her last breath.

706
01:38:48,741 --> 01:38:51,555
How did you find me?

707
01:38:51,621 --> 01:38:53,214
I'm the man.

708
01:38:57,220 --> 01:39:00,516
One more thing, Sofie.

709
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:04,508
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
