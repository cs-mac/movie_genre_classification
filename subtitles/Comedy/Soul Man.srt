Hi. Hi.

21
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,591
The mail came. They're here.

22
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,728
Both of 'em. Holy shit!

23
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,002
You open yours first. No, you.

24
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,005
I'll open yours. You open mine. Okay.

25
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:17,007
No, no. I'll open mine,
you open yours. Okay.

26
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:19,576
You open yours first.
We'll open 'em together.

27
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:21,645
Okay. All right. On three.

28
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:25,984
One, two wait a minute!

29
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:29,054
Gordon, before we do this,
I just want to say...

30
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:32,824
You're my best buddy, and I love you.

31
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:35,161
And if you get accepted and I don't,

32
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,563
I hope you rot in hell.

33
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:40,100
I feel the same way. Thanks.

34
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:53,015
You son of a bitch!

35
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,884
You got in, didn't you?

36
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:01,757
Well, so did I.

37
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:04,528
Yeah! Yea! Ooh!

Hello! Come on in! Alf, how you doin'?

00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,901
Come on, Brad. It'll be fun.

48
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,170
And it's never too soon
to start networking.

49
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,812
Howdy. Welcome.

Come on in. Hey, guys. Hi!

51
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:25,520
Hi. You guys.

52
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:29,191
Bradley and I just think it
is absolutely unbelievable...

53
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,994
That you are both going to Harvard law!

54
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:35,098
Don't we, Bradley? Uh, yeah. Unbelievable.

55
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,467
Thanks, Brad. Where are you goin'?

56
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:39,869
Uh, looks like B.U. Oh!

57
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:43,641
Well, I tell you what. When you get
out, have your girl call our girl...

58
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,743
And we'll see what we can do for ya.

59
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:49,681
Oh, you guys!

60
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,251
So, the way I figure it,

61
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,421
we merge a few corporations,

62
00:06:55,489 --> 00:07:00,093
and when the antitrust suits
come up, we handle the defense.

63
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:02,395
We make our first mil at 30.

64
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,966
Retire to the islands at 35.

65
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:08,436
I don't know.

66
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:10,838
Ii kinda wanted to run for senate.

67
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:14,109
Senate it is, then. Great party.

68
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:16,111
Hey, Seth. What's goin' on?

69
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,515
You finished your Ph.D. yet? Yeah, totally.

70
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:23,453
I'm doing biochem research
for a suntan lotion company.

71
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,689
<i>It's great!</i>

72
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:29,993
You guys mind if I crash
here for a few days?

73
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:31,996
No problem.

74
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,332
Thanks.

75
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,435
Suntan lotion. I never thought Seth...

76
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:40,406
Would wind up doing something
that socially meaningful.

77
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:43,809
Hey. People change, Gordo.

78
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:54,155
Harvard law school. This is a
big day for all of us, mark.

79
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,358
Yes, sir. You know, son?

80
00:07:57,427 --> 00:08:01,263
The only thing I've ever wanted
is to give you everything.

81
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:04,933
Good home, good education,

82
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:07,036
nice car

83
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:09,439
and I've worked very hard
for all those things.

84
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:12,775
Very hard. You have, dad.

85
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:14,945
Very hard. Yes.

86
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:19,383
<i>Some might say it was time I did
something for myself for a change.</i>

87
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:22,854
Your father's therapist says he needs
to learn to express the child in him.

88
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:25,723
<i>Oh, shut up, Dorothy. Son, you've had...</i>

89
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,993
<i>A pretty happy childhood, wouldn't you say?</i>

90
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:31,430
It was<i> great,</i> dad. Yes,
it was great, wasn't it?

91
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:37,237
And who gave you that great childhood, son?

92
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,473
You did. That's right.

93
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:44,379
I did. And now, I have one more
thing that I want to give you.

94
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:49,585
It's the biggest and the best thing
that a father could give to his son.

95
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,388
Do you know what that thing is, mark?

96
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,758
A Ferrari?

97
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,960
Oh, boy.

98
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,129
That thing is manhood.

99
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,068
<i>Son, I want to give you your manhood.</i>

100
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:14,630
What, uh

101
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:16,666
what would that mean in practical terms?

102
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:19,936
Well, it means that I want
you to go to Harvard.

103
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:24,374
And I want you to work hard.
Very, very hard.

104
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:26,443
<i>I also want you to feel
good about yourself.</i>

105
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:29,613
<i>You want to feel good about
yourself, don't you, son?</i>

106
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:32,817
Sure, dad.

107
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:35,453
That's why I've decided to
let you pay your own way.

108
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,885
Dad! That's

109
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:51,589
that's... a sweet gesture,

110
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,892
but it's really not necessary.

111
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,396
Oh, I think it is. What
are you saying, dad?

112
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,867
Well, I'm saying that I've taken your
money from your tuition account,

113
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:06,873
and used it to buy timeshare
in a condo in Barbados!

114
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,947
<i>Vaya con dios,</i> son.

115
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:23,491
Ten thousand, four hundred
and ninety-three dollars.

116
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,534
Seven thousand, five hundred dollars.

117
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:44,649
Fifty-three thousand, nine hundred
and seventy-nine dollars.

118
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:49,221
<i>Okay, but don't you think
you're overreacting?</i>

119
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,256
No.

120
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,265
Any last requests?

121
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:03,370
No? Good.

122
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:13,882
Right, here we go. "$5,000
to a young man...

123
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,119
"Of Ukrainian descent;

124
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:19,856
to a young woman of demonstrated
leadership ability"

125
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,858
okay! Right. Here it is:

126
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:24,795
"Half of all costs to the most
qualified applicant holding a Ph.D....

127
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,831
In classical or medieval jurisprudence."

128
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,661
This is ridiculous. There's nothing
here I even remotely qualify for.

129
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:31,636
Whoa, whoa! Wait a second. Look at this.

130
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:34,305
"The Henry Q. Bouchard memorial fellowship.

131
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:37,210
"Full tuition plus $8,000 annual stipend...

132
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,512
To the most qualified applicant
from Los Angeles, California."

133
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,648
Let me see that.

134
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:45,919
"The most qualified <i>black</i>
applicant," you idiot.

135
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,921
Oh.

136
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,792
Well, I realize my father
makes a lot of money, but...

137
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:53,261
You see, he's not giving me any.

138
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,867
I see.

139
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,869
You have a nice day too, ma'am.

140
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:04,741
What did she say?

141
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,178
She said they had financial aid for
people whose parents are poor.

142
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:11,547
Not people whose parents are assholes.

143
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:14,318
All right. Have you ever
applied for a loan before?

144
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:17,255
No. How's your credit history?

145
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,491
I just told you I never
applied for a loan before.

146
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,860
How could I have a credit history?

147
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:49,258
One unpaid July 1983 bill
in the amount of 57.43...

148
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:51,260
From the department of water and power.

149
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:53,595
Oh! I can explain that.

150
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:57,835
One outstanding debt to pacific
bell in the amount of 72.12.

151
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,537
Oh, but, but you see, that was<i> their</i> fault.

152
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:03,341
Sixteen bounced checks from this bank.
Oh, but you see,

153
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,449
that shouldn't affect my
credit rating, because...

154
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:07,445
Those were just bookkeeping slip-ups.

155
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:13,219
What a relief. Well, I mean, it's
not like I'm<i> poor</i> or something.

156
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:16,689
In all those cases, I had the money. It's
not like I couldn't make the payments.

157
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:19,592
Mr. Watson, I'm gonna level with you.
This bank is finicky,

158
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,694
in that, when we make a
loan, it is important...

159
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:25,366
Not only that the customer<i> have</i>
the money to make the payments,

160
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:29,537
but also that he or she
<i>give</i> the money to us.

161
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:32,975
<i>I just feel so frustrated!</i>

162
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:37,347
I mean, Harvard law school.

163
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:39,983
It's the opportunity of a lifetime!

164
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:43,120
It's what I spent four years
working for, and now, just

165
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,924
just to see it all slip away like this

166
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,159
<i>so, if I'm hearing you correctly,</i>

167
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,229
what you're saying is...

168
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:55,566
That you believe your father
misinterpreted my advice to him,

169
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:59,605
to mean that he had no further
obligation to anyone but himself.

170
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:03,209
Exactly! And if I could just
explain myself to him...

171
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,046
More clearly, then he would...

172
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:09,482
Realize his mistake, and probably
offer to pay your tuition.

173
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,485
Right!

174
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,822
Wouldn't it be great if we could have this
all straightened out by father's day?

175
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:18,961
Yes! Yes.

176
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,531
Yes. First of all,

177
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,135
let me try to explain myself to you.

178
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:29,706
You see, I have a son about your age.

179
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:33,210
<i>And he has wants and needs...</i>

180
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,680
Much like your own.

181
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:38,749
When he was 14, he wanted a dirt bike.

182
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:41,653
When he was 16, he wanted a car.

183
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:44,056
When he was 18, he wanted college,

184
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:48,995
and now he wants a three-bedroom beach
front Coop in rancho palos verdes!

185
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:52,198
<i>He just wants, and wants, and wants!</i>

186
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,235
I work my ass off to give
him everything he wants.

187
00:14:55,304 --> 00:15:00,040
He always wants<i> more!</i> He probably
wants to sleep with my wife!

188
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:03,578
Uh, doctor, I don't think <i>shut up!</i>

189
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:05,714
Shut up! You're all alike.

190
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:08,851
You'll bleed us dry until
we're nothing but bones,

191
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,353
and when we finally crumble to dust,

192
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,388
you'll dance on our ashes!

193
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:15,892
Go windsurfing!

194
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:20,330
Yes, Phyllis? Dr. Aronson,
your group is here.

195
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:32,678
Go back to your father, mark.

196
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:36,449
Talk to him. Reason with him.

197
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,785
Beg.

198
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:43,390
I'm sorry, Gordo, but I can't go crawling
back there, like some pathetic wretch,

199
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,160
and kiss that man's feet! Why not?

200
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,295
Because I did that yesterday.

201
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,902
Well, look, mark, there's a lot
of good law schools around.

202
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:59,876
Five words, Gordo. For
you, I have five words.

203
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:03,312
There is no substitute.

204
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:05,448
<i>Well!</i>

205
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:09,687
Mark! Gordon! Bradley.

206
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:13,091
How<i> incredibly</i> swell to see you.

207
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,626
Oh, mark, I can't tell you
how sorry I was to hear...

208
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,997
You couldn't get the
money to go to Harvard.

209
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:20,800
Uh, whiskey sour, please? What a shame.

210
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:23,969
But look, I think I can pull some strings
and get you into B.U. At midterm.

211
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:27,240
Why don't you give me a call?
I got the money, Brad.

212
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:29,242
<i>Oh? How?</i>

213
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:33,147
Where there's a will, there's a way.

214
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:36,017
Yeah? And what's your way?

215
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,121
It's a<i> secret</i> way.

216
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,456
A secret way?

217
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:47,296
Well, that's great, Marko.

218
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:51,901
But just in case your
"secret way" falls through,

219
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,805
feel free to look me up, huh?

220
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:56,807
Thanks for the cocktail, Gordon.

221
00:16:56,876 --> 00:17:00,278
You don't believe me, do you?

222
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:03,248
You don't believe me? Well,
the joke's on you, sucker,

223
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:07,686
because I'm going to Harvard,
and don't call me a liar!

224
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:11,657
That asshole thinks I'm lying!
Mark, you<i> are</i> lying.

225
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:16,663
I don't believe you said that. For
Christ's sake, be realistic. Look.

226
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:21,202
Your father's in Barbados. Your
grandfather's in forest lawn.

227
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,571
And your credit rating's in the toilet.

228
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,811
Now, where the hell are
you going to get $53,000?

229
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:38,088
Congratulations, Mr. Watson.
And good luck at Harvard.

230
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,491
Thank you, sir. I'll do my best.

231
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:32,183
Hey, Gordo!

232
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:36,087
Wait up!

233
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:43,229
I don't believe this. This is unbelievable!

234
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,798
I don't believe this
is really unbelievable.

235
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:48,668
So I went over to see Seth at his lab the
other day, and he gave me these pills.

236
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:50,670
Never take<i> anything</i> Seth gives you.

237
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,874
It's a new product this suntan
lotion company's developing.

238
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:55,776
They're tanning pills. They
chemically tan your skin.

239
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:59,147
Mark, I don't know how to tell
you this, but you're<i> not</i> tan.

240
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,750
You're black. Yeah.

241
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,419
I exceeded the recommended dosage.

242
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:08,824
Gordo, these babies are my
ticket into Harvard law school!

243
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:11,861
I'm going on the Henry Q.
Bouchard memorial scholarship...

244
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,565
For the best black applicant
from Los Angeles, California.

245
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:18,302
Mark, this is crazy! You can't do this.

246
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:20,805
I already did it! Yeah, but mark

247
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:23,608
you can't just take a scholarship
away from some black person.

248
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,796
Gordo, gordo, gordo. How
many people do you think...

249
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:28,614
From Los Angeles got accepted
into Harvard this year?

250
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:32,184
About four. And out of that four,
how many do you think were black?

251
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,354
One. <i>Uno.</i>

252
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,523
And that guy got a better
deal from Stanford.

253
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:41,028
So, if you hadn't come along, the money
would have just sat there? Exactly!

254
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,264
But mark, do you realize
what this means? I mean...

255
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,900
You're gonna have to be a black person.
No shit.

256
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,169
Yeah, but for three years, mark.

257
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:52,074
Three years! What's that gonna be like?
Gordo, it's gonna be great!

258
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:55,345
These are the '80s, man.
It's the Cosby decade.

259
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:58,514
America loves black people.

Supposed to get the key from
a guy named Roy McGrady.

286
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:36,260
Well, this is it!

287
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,662
All right! Home, sweet home.

288
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,766
Hang on. Whoop.

289
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,803
Is, uh, something wrong, Mr. McGrady?

290
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,407
Yeah, there may be. When your
mother rented this place,

291
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:51,944
she never told me that
your roommate was, a, uh

292
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:54,681
what? Uh, you know, a black.

293
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:57,217
What? A black negro!

294
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:59,752
Mark?

295
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:02,623
A black<i> negro?</i> Right.

296
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:05,293
Wait a minute. Where'd you
get this information?

297
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:09,164
He never told me he was a black negro.
I'm shocked.

298
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,900
Ii don't know what to

299
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:15,104
thank you for telling me this, Mr. McGrady.

300
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:17,207
Just when you think you
get to know somebody.

301
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:20,210
I'm gonna go confront him
with this right now. Oh, boy!

302
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:23,414
Mark, a black negro? I can't believe it!

303
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,852
Smart ass little rubberneck.

304
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:32,424
Boy, this guy McGrady is a real dog brain.

305
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:35,594
Who cares? Look at this place.

306
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:37,963
This is a great apartment.

307
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:52,380
And I love the view.

308
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,741
<i>I think she likes me.</i>

309
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,911
Well, it's your building, Mr. Dunbar.

310
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,281
Yeah. Well, there's nothing
legally we can do right now.

311
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:10,951
You just keep your eyes open for
anything that breaks the lease.

312
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:13,120

So, Gord man, tell me: What do you think?

319
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:47,809
I think I'm in paradise. I mean, look

320
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:50,546
these women! They're brilliant,

321
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:53,849
ambitious, cultured

322
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:57,154
each one with the intellectual capacity to

323
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,259
she's not wearing a slip, is she?

324
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:03,361
Ten black guys and one white guy.

325
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,363
What do you call the white guy?
I don't know.

326
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:09,401
Quarterback. You get a thousand
black guys and one white guy,

327
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,503
what do you call the white guy? I give up.

328
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,940
Warden.

329
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:17,243
Sorry.

330
00:24:17,312 --> 00:24:22,450
Look, no offense. Really, just a joke.
Hey, no problem.

331
00:24:22,518 --> 00:24:26,187
Yeah. Funny guys. I like them.

332
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:28,722
What are you gonna do?

333
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:33,361
So, what's the plan? I say,
we divide and conquer.

334
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,899
Well, let's see. Why don't you
take the ones <i>with</i> undergarments,

335
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:38,934
and I'll take the ones without.

336
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:43,740
We gotta use <i>some</i> system. Indeed.

337
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:57,590
So, um

338
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:04,931
excuse me.

339
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,103
Hi. I'm Sarah Walker.

340
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,673
Mark Watson. Can I get you anything?

341
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:14,908
Cheese, punch, a new car

342
00:25:14,977 --> 00:25:16,910
no, thank you. I just
want to let you know...

343
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:20,081
That the first B.L.S.A. Meeting is
this Thursday, in Hastings hall.

344
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,284
Will you be there? It's a date.

345
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:24,953
No, it's not.

346
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:30,593
I<i> love</i> the law!

347
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:34,431
I love being black.

348
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,901
I love this woman oh, god, is she beautiful!

349
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,038
You gotta believe me. I believe you.

350
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:43,408
Oh, and she is
incredibly attracted to me.

351
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:45,410
Right. I want to believe you.

352
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:47,680
<i>If you have a yellow card,

<i>Classes now full are</i> hey, gordo.

355
00:25:54,923 --> 00:25:57,724
I think I just changed my mind.
I'm taking criminal law.

356
00:25:57,793 --> 00:26:00,761
But, I thought we decided not to
take that until next semester.

357
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,266
That's before I found out
the prof was a brother.

358
00:26:05,335 --> 00:26:07,736
<i>Mr. Van Dusen?</i>

359
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:10,972
<i>Here.</i> Miss Walker

360
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:14,777
here. <i>Mr. Watson</i>

361
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:16,979
right on.

362
00:26:23,423 --> 00:26:27,825
Mr. Wizansky present, sir.

363
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:30,662
<i>Miss Zendel? Here.</i>

364
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:34,700
You know, the minute I saw you,
I knew we were both "W's."

365
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,872
God, I just love sitting in
alphabetical order, don't you?

366
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:42,475
More than life itself. God!

367
00:26:42,544 --> 00:26:45,479
Before I discuss the
contents of this course,

368
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:47,648
I would like to make a few things clear.

369
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:54,522
Some of you may have had
easy lives up until now.

370
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:58,327
Some of you may not.

371
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:03,833
Life this semester is not going
to be easy for any of you.

372
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,906
Your grades in the first
year of law school...

373
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,243
Can determine your entire
future in the law.

374
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:15,380
To do well in this course,

375
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:18,850
<i>you must be fully prepared
for each class meeting,</i>

376
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,655
<i>and all written work must be on time.</i>

377
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:27,827
No excuses. I repeat, no excuses...

378
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,731
Will be accepted for failure to
complete all tasks assigned...

379
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:34,302
<i>In the time allotted.</i>

380
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,671
That's what he tells his
wife when they go to bed.

381
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:45,580
Do<i> you</i> have something to say, Mr. Watson?

382
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:49,619
Well, sir, to be honest,

383
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:53,457
I just couldn't help murmuring my
approval of your opening remarks.

384
00:27:53,526 --> 00:27:55,726
Very impressive, sir.

385
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:58,061
Try to contain your enthusiasm...

386
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,832
In the future, Mr. Watson.

387
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,936
<i>Please. Call me mark.</i>

388
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:15,816
You know, if you ever need any
help with your homework, or...

389
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:17,818
If you want to talk

390
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:20,988
personal problems, anything,

391
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:23,224
anything at all

392
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,960
I'm there for ya. I'll keep it in mind.

393
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:33,502
What an ass! What an asshole.

394
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:40,977
Hey, gordo? What's this "B.L.S.A."? Yeah?

395
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:46,584
B.L.S.A.? Well, that's the, uh,
black law student's association.

396
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:50,522
I think it's like, you know,
a real militant group.

397
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,228
<i>♫</i>

398
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:13,147
Somebody here call a cab?

399
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,392
<i>You're really unbelievable.</i> You
said they were a militant group.

400
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,031
Now I've blown it with Sarah.

401
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,369
Mark, mark, check it out.

402
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,822
I told you she liked me.

403
00:29:42,766 --> 00:29:45,935
The lengths some women
will go to get to me.

404
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:48,405
Sometimes, even I can
hardly believe it. Hey.

405
00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:50,907
Maybe she likes me.

406
00:29:56,716 --> 00:30:00,719
Hi, there. Hi. Remember me?

407
00:30:00,787 --> 00:30:02,921
Remember you? Are you kidding?

408
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:05,090
I had your face embroidered on my pillow.

409
00:30:05,158 --> 00:30:07,327
What's your name?

410
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:10,830
Whitney, what's yours? Hi!
Gordon Bloomfeld.

411
00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:12,865
Of the Marina Del Rey Bloomfelds.

412
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:15,636
Can we help you move anything in?
Uh, thank you.

413
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:17,638
Thank you, that won't be necessary, uh

414
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,544
hmm. Come on, Whitney.

415
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,179
I want you to stay away from him.

416
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:29,418
Why, because he's black?
No, because I say so.

417
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:33,756
<i>Put it up! All right.</i>

418
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:46,971
Is this where we sign up? Mm hmm. Names?

419
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,909
Mark Watson. <i>Okey dokey, why don't
we just take mark on our team...</i>

420
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:53,279
<i>And you can have, uh Gordon Bloomfeld.</i>

421
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:56,283
No, why don't you guys take Gordon,

422
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:59,786
and we'll take Marcus. Oh,
well, you know, look, I...

423
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:03,824
Wrote it down this way, and I know
the way you hate a messy team list.

424
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:06,761
So, uh, come on. Ernie, you guys get Leon.

425
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:09,931
We get Marcus. Uh, that's mark.

426
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,200
Look, guys, I'm really not
that good or anything.

427
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:14,202
Well, there you go. He's
not really that good.

428
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:17,807
So, why don't we take him, 'cause in all
fairness, we may have the stronger team here.

429
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,343
Listen, scumbag <i>guys, guys.</i>

430
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,781
Look, I'm not that good.
Have you played before?

431
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,183
Well, on the playground.

432
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,186
Gimme that. Don't even think about it.

433
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:35,627
Don't start waiting for this

434
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:38,030
right here, right now.

435
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:40,733
Okay. Fillmore, you can take Matthews.

436
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:42,735
We got Washington here on the coin toss.

437
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:45,138
So he can take Leonthat's Watson.

438
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:48,875

00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,967
<i>Miss Zendel!</i>

478
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:26,672
<i>Can you cite for us the
precedent for that decision?</i>

479
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:29,809
Uh... yes, sir.

480
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:34,648
I mean, uh

481
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:36,650
I mean, uh

482
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:43,458
well, actually, what I mean is that

483
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:47,529
no, sir, I can't.

484
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:51,267
God! Mr. Wizansky?

485
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:54,236
Yes, sir. I believe I can.

486
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:59,042
It was the 1972 case of<i> Oklahoma vs.
Powell.</i>

487
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:02,413
<i>Very authoritatively stated, Mr.
Wizansky, and very wrong.</i>

488
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:05,216
<i>Mr. Watson?</i>

489
00:35:06,652 --> 00:35:10,356
Can you name the precedent for us?
Yes, sir.

490
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:12,958
The "precedent," sir, is

491
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,196
is Ronald Reagan, sir.

492
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:19,132
Mr. Watson.

493
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,235
I am not a humorless man.

494
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:26,407
But if you're going to take up
my class time making jokes,

495
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:28,609
please see to it that they are funny!

496
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,681
<i>Miss Walker?</i>

497
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,886
Uh,<i> Rhode Island vs. Calletano.</i>

498
00:35:36,954 --> 00:35:39,489
What year, miss Walker?

499
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:42,658
1969, sir.

500
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:46,696
Anyone else here agree with
miss Walker's citation?

501
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:54,805
That's unfortunate. It
happens to be correct.

502
00:35:57,377 --> 00:36:00,246
Hey, Sarah?

503
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:03,382
That was really good in there.
I was impressed. Thanks.

504
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:05,519
Listen, I was just wondering if, you know,

505
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:07,720
maybe you'd like to get together sometime.

506
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:10,290
And do what? Storm the
administration building?

507
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:13,061
Maybe take a few hostages? Sure!

508
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,564
Or, we could just stay at home and phone
in a few bomb threats if you'd rather.

509
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:22,571
Listen, about that, uh, B.L.S.A. Thing.

510
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,374
I'm really sorry, you know. I wasn't
trying to make fun of it or anything,

511
00:36:25,443 --> 00:36:28,278
I was just trying to make
an impression. You did.

512
00:36:28,346 --> 00:36:31,314
You know, there's something really strange
about you, and I don't know what it is.

513
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:34,651
You see? You see? I knew you'd
like me once you got to know me.

514
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,521
Come on. Why don't you let me buy you
dinner sometime? You gotta eat, right?

515
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,658
Mark, this is Harvard. I don't have to eat.
I don't have to sleep.

516
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:44,662
I just have to study. Okay, so let's
study together. I could drill you.

517
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:47,400
Quiz you. Come on. I'm serious about this.

518
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:49,835
I know you don't need the help,
but I could really use it.

519
00:36:49,904 --> 00:36:53,740
What do you say? My place, tonight.
I can't tonight.

520
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,842
Friday. In the library.

521
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:58,412
You want to study on a Friday night?

522
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:03,651
Okay. Friday night.

523
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,421
8:00, second floor lounge. It's a date.

524
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,425
No. It's an appointment.

525
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,596
Okay, it's an appointment!

526
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:17,066
<i>I met her at the laundromat. I'm not
saying it's serious or anything,</i>

527
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:20,203
but, uh, we did share a dryer.

528
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:23,407
Gentle cycle. Low heat.

529
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:28,780
We just sat together and watched our clothes
rolling around on top of one another.

530
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,049
I think it stirred something in both of us.

531
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:35,354
You know, I got a study date
with Sarah Friday night?

532
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,757
I'm Thinkin' about growing some 'dreads.

533
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:40,160
She let me put my hand inside her blouse.

534
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:42,708
It wasn't the one she was wearing,
of course, but it's a start.

535
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:44,731
Isn't it great? Oh, it sure is.

536
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,168
Maybe I should get my car reuphol, Gordon?

537
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:50,972
Woohoo! Woohoo! Gordon Bloomfeld?
Is that you?

538
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:54,209
It can't be! It is. Keep walkin'.

539
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:57,146
Shit! Don't say anything.

540
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:59,148
She might recognize your voice. <i>Gordy?</i>

541
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:03,786
Gordon? Gordon Bloomfeld! Gordon!

542
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:08,192
Oh, it is so good to see you!

543
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,360
Why haven't you called us?

544
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:12,597
Hi, Lisa. Hi.

545
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,066
Brad. How's it going, Gordon?

546
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:19,838
Hi, I'm Lisa Stimson, and this
is Brad small. Say hi, Brad.

547
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:23,409
<i>We're old friends of Gordy's.
Do you go to Harvard, too?</i>

548
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:26,779
It's a great school, isn't it?
Just the best?

549
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:31,484
Is he blind? What?

550
00:38:31,553 --> 00:38:36,056
Is he blind? No, no. He's just dumb.

551
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,526
Completely dumb. And a little deaf.

552
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:42,598
<i>You're going to have to speak up.
Hey! This is Brad...</i>

553
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,600
<i>And Lisa!</i>

554
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:48,538
<i>I'd like you to meet my
good friend, uh, Karim.</i>

555
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:50,640
Karim Abdul... Ali.

556
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:52,942
Nice to meet you, Karim!

557
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:56,947
Is he a Muslim, or

558
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,983
no, he's Canadian. Oh, no kidding.

559
00:39:00,052 --> 00:39:03,388
Does Karim go to Harvard, too? Uh, no.

560
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:06,057
Uh, he works. That is,
he's looking for work.

561
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:11,397
He was a Mountie up in Canada, don't you
know? So it's been an uphill battle.

562
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:15,068
<i>There's so little for mounties in Boston.</i>

563
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:17,471
If you hear of anything oh,
yeah, absolutely.

564
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:20,006
We'll keep our eyes open.

565
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:22,009
So, Gordy, how's mark?

566
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:26,147
You know, Brad may be going here next year.
We just checked in up at admissions.

567
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:29,985
And they told us that he is at the
top of the transfer wait list!

568
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:33,155
Oh, that's great, Brad.

569
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:35,759
Yeah, just one person
drops out of your class,

570
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:38,528
or gets kicked out, and I'm in.

571
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:43,367
You know, he looks familiar.
He's a common physical type!

572
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:48,238
Uh, look, it was really great to see
the two of you like this, but, uh

573
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:50,241
oh. We gotta go.

574
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:53,211
Come on, Karim. You don't want to be late!

575
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,181
He's got a, uh, meeting with
the park police at 2:00.

576
00:39:56,249 --> 00:40:01,020
He's interviewing with some
of their top... horses.

577
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:04,057
<i>Well, bye bye. Let's get
together, real soon!</i>

578
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:12,099
I think you handled that very well.
Thank you.

579
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,106
Come on in. Hi.

580
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:22,645
Do you think you could help me
change the washer on my shower?

581
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,148
<i>I can't find Mr. McGrady anywhere.</i>

582
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:29,118
So you go to Radcliffe?

583
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:32,757
Very impressive.

584
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,427
What's your major?

585
00:40:36,496 --> 00:40:39,498
Political science. Honors.

586
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,500
Of course. But what does
that really mean anyway?

587
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:44,269
It's all such a game.

588
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:49,008
I'm writing my senior thesis on the
American civil rights movement.

589
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:51,378
What?

590
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:56,884
No, it's this is just such
an incredible coincidence.

591
00:40:57,953 --> 00:40:59,988
I happen to love civil rights.

592
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:02,824
God. Really?

593
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:07,463
<i>That was incredible, mark.</i>

594
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:19,810
I mean, it was like...

595
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:22,380
I could really<i> feel...</i>

596
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:24,716
Four hundred years of oppression...

597
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:28,521
And anger in every pelvic thrust!

598
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:32,491
Ohh!

599
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,996
I hope you don't mind if I use bits of this
interlude in a short story I'm working on.

600
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:40,366
Well wait. It's called "shades of gray."

601
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:44,071
Because, you know, I really don't feel
like there's any black and white.

602
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,207
Only shades of gray.

603
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:53,649
Well, like the stereotypes about black men.

604
00:41:53,717 --> 00:41:57,587
Some of them are true.
Like the breast thing.

605
00:41:57,656 --> 00:42:01,458
And, well, you really are very...

606
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:04,995
Dynamic, sexually.

607
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:09,433
But then, of course, some of the
stereotypes are completely untrue.

608
00:42:09,502 --> 00:42:13,605
Yeah? Like what? Like the
one about penis size.

609
00:42:13,674 --> 00:42:16,475
I'm having dinner with my parents tonight.

610
00:42:16,543 --> 00:42:20,079
Why don't you come with me? I'd love for
them to meet you. Uh, tonight, I don't

611
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:22,281
wait!

612
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,585
Before you say no...

613
00:42:24,653 --> 00:42:27,588
Let me tell you what's for dessert.

614
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:53,250
Thank you.

615
00:42:57,123 --> 00:42:59,992
<i>Raspberry tart, mark? Oh, no thank you.</i>

616
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,228
I really couldn't eat another bite.

617
00:43:03,296 --> 00:43:06,365
All my life,

618
00:43:09,738 --> 00:43:11,771
white women!

619
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,509
And now, at last, I'm going to have one!

620
00:43:24,654 --> 00:43:27,723
Bundy Dunbar, how many
times have I asked you...

621
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:30,426
<i>Not to watch that thing
at the dinner table?</i>

622
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:58,291
Daddy, did I tell you mark's going to
Harvard law school? On scholarship?

623
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:00,794
Yes. Yeah. You did.

624
00:44:00,862 --> 00:44:04,632
Go get my heroin and my
hypodermic needle, bitch!

625
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,634
Get me some more watermelon
while you're at it.

626
00:44:06,702 --> 00:44:08,669
Yes, dear. White, fat-ass slut.

627
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:13,475
What yo' lookin' at?

628
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:38,971
Hi. Oh, Sarah called a couple hours ago.

629
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,776
Sounded sorta pissed. Oh, shit!

630
00:44:43,845 --> 00:44:46,646
<i>You will see on your syllabus...</i>

631
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:51,285
<i>That your first major written
assignment is due...</i>

632
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:54,655
The Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

633
00:44:56,025 --> 00:44:58,025
<i>I would suggest that you
begin work on it...</i>

634
00:44:58,094 --> 00:45:00,028
<i>As soon as possible.</i>

635
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,798
<i>Those of you whose performance so far...</i>

636
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:07,136
<i>Has been less than... outstanding...</i>

637
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:11,340
<i>Might try to do a particularly good job.</i>

638
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,818
Sarah, I'm really sorry.

639
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:22,554
Something came up.

640
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:24,890
Can we study tonight?

641
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:27,693
No. I think you just better drill yourself.

642
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:38,171
Mark, I understand what you're feeling.

643
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,576
But honestly I think we just need
to talk this thing through.

644
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:45,780
I mean, we don't have any
problems sexually, right?

645
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:55,825
Excuse me, miss, but do you have any of that
jello salad with the little marshmallows in it?

646
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:02,567
Uh, I'm so sorry. We're
out of that right now.

647
00:46:08,776 --> 00:46:12,210
<i>How many black electricians does
it take to screw in a light bulb?</i>

648
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:15,513
<i>I give up. Two! One to hold the light bulb,</i>

649
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:18,718
<i>and the other one to drive the
pink Cadillac in tight circles.</i>

650
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:23,457
Hey, guy! Sorry. Really.

651
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:26,627
<i>No offense, right? Just a little joke?</i>

652
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:29,965
Don't worry about it.

653
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:55,361
Jesus Christ!

654
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:05,339
What the hell did I do? You
changed lanes without signaling.

655
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:07,241
So let's see your license and registration.

656
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:11,113
If you haven't lost it. I haven't lost it.

657
00:48:24,396 --> 00:48:27,631
All right, so I lost it!
There's no law against that.

658
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,634
Look, I really don't have time for this.

659
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:33,105
I have a very important
assignment due tomorrow, and

660
00:48:33,173 --> 00:48:37,977
okay. Okay, so I<i> misplaced</i> my license.
What the hell are you gonna do, arrest me?

661
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,291
Hi, there.

662
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,295
Good game?

663
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:00,870
We lost gee, that's too bad.

664
00:49:05,177 --> 00:49:07,710
To a bunch of niggers.

665
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:18,190
But this, of course,
raises the question...

666
00:49:18,259 --> 00:49:21,593
Of criminal intent.

667
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:28,567
I see he decided to come
in native costume today.

668
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:31,504
<i>If you've had some sort of accident...</i>

669
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:33,507
Mr. Watson,

670
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:35,709
perhaps you should have
taken the entire day off.

671
00:49:35,778 --> 00:49:37,711
Oh, I'm fine.

672
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,382
I just got in sort of a fight.

673
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:44,286
I mean I mean, it wasn't my fault!

674
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:49,058
You see, they threw me in this
cell with these real ass

675
00:49:49,127 --> 00:49:53,763
some extremely unsportsmanlike fellows.

676
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:58,468
I dislike interruptions
in my class, Mr. Watson.

677
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,639
Try to remember that if you can.

678
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,275
Yes, sir.

679
00:50:13,087 --> 00:50:15,722
<i>Please leave your assignments
with me before you go.</i>

680
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:21,328
Watson.

681
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:24,832
I don't believe I have your paper.

682
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:32,274
Look, professor,

683
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:34,276
with all due respect, sir,

684
00:50:35,747 --> 00:50:38,514
I just spent 18 hours in a jail cell...

685
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,616
On no formal charges,

686
00:50:40,685 --> 00:50:44,288
getting pulverized by drunken bigots.

687
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:47,557
And you expect memr. Watson,

688
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:51,229
I said there would be no
excuses for late work,

689
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,099
and I meant no excuses.

690
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:58,504
A judge and jury won't give a damn if
you've had a bad day before a trial.

691
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:03,142
I would think<i> you...</i>

692
00:51:03,211 --> 00:51:05,545
Could understand.

693
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:08,681
You'll get no special treatment
from me, Mr. Watson.

694
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,819
Do you hear me? No special treatment.

695
00:51:11,888 --> 00:51:15,390
And if that means you've got
to work twice as hard...

696
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,626
As these little white<i> shits,</i>

697
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:21,330
then you damn well better
work twice as hard.

698
00:51:24,368 --> 00:51:28,871
I understand you are allowed
one phone call from jail?

699
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:32,310
Yes, sir.

700
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:38,115
Next time you get arrested,
use it to call me.

701
00:51:40,687 --> 00:51:43,221
I'll bring you your books.

702
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,225
You can study in jail, if you have to.

703
00:51:46,294 --> 00:51:48,227
You understand me?

704
00:51:50,765 --> 00:51:55,102
Yes, sir. You have that paper on
my desk by 9:00 tomorrow morning.

705
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,907
Yes, sir.

706
00:51:59,977 --> 00:52:02,110
Oh, Mr. Watson?

707
00:52:03,513 --> 00:52:06,614
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

00:54:31,649 --> 00:54:33,549
Nah, I go to Eleanor Roosevelt.

742
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:36,720
Eleanor Roosevelt? Good school.

743
00:54:38,757 --> 00:54:40,657
My name's mark Watson. What's yours?

744
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:43,461
George Walker.

745
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,302
Sarah! Hi.

746
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,871
I didn't know you had a I mean yeah.

747
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,908
Come on, George. It's getting crowded.
You've gotta go sit in the back.

748
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:10,892
Okay. Why did the negro wear a tux
on his way to his vasectomy? Why?

749
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:14,629
"Because if I'm gonna be 'impotent, '

750
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:16,932
I might as well look 'impo'tant.'"

751
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,975
hey, no offense. Right, pal?

752
00:55:30,416 --> 00:55:35,720
There are a number of cases
exemplary of this phenomenon.

753
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,559
Miss Walker.

754
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:44,196
Could you cite one for us?

755
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:48,869
Uh

756
00:55:50,205 --> 00:55:53,674
uh uh, sir, I believe that was the 1979...

757
00:55:53,743 --> 00:55:55,910
<i>Case of</i> new York Mr.. Watson.

758
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:59,848
If this were a court of law, you
would be cited for contempt.

759
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:04,052
Uh, well I would never
do that in court, sir.

760
00:56:04,121 --> 00:56:07,524
Not that I don't have the same
respect for you you may shut up now,

761
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:10,259
Mr. Watson. Thank you, sir.

762
00:56:18,704 --> 00:56:22,974
Miss Walker, perhaps you could
complete the case citation...

763
00:56:23,043 --> 00:56:25,343
That your irrepressible colleague...

764
00:56:25,412 --> 00:56:27,346
So ably began.

765
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:32,251
Uh

766
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:38,759
no, sir. I can't.

767
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:43,230
Don't apologize to me. Just remember,

768
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,500
the final is less than two weeks away,

769
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,903
and you're going to need an "a"...

770
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:51,273
If you hope to bring your grade for the
semester up to an acceptable level.

771
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:53,275
Yes, sir.

772
00:56:57,549 --> 00:56:59,483
Sarah, wait a second.

773
00:56:59,551 --> 00:57:01,618
Sarah!

774
00:57:05,057 --> 00:57:08,092
Sarah, wait a second. Oh,
just leave me alone.

775
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,095
Sorry. Listen, I just wanted to

776
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:12,798
don't you think I've had enough
humiliation for one day?

777
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:17,103
No! I mean

778
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:19,772
ii mean I don't think you
should feel humiliated.

779
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:21,774
Don't patronize me.

780
00:57:21,843 --> 00:57:24,444
I'm not! Sarah

781
00:57:24,514 --> 00:57:27,748
Sarah, listen to me. You're the
smartest person in that class.

782
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:30,952
You just have too much to do. You're
working twice as hard as everybody else.

783
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:32,954
It looks like I'm not working hard enough.

784
00:57:33,023 --> 00:57:35,757
Well, Jesus, you just don't
have enough time! Exactly!

785
00:57:35,826 --> 00:57:38,293
And the last thing I have time for is you.

786
00:57:40,565 --> 00:57:45,035
Look. I don't want to be
a pain in the ass here,

787
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:47,771
but I just want to say that
the offer still stands.

788
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,907
To study together.

789
00:57:49,975 --> 00:57:53,778
You know, we both need this final to pull
our grades up. And we still have ten days.

790
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:58,283
I'll be in the library at
7:00, if you're interested.

791
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:11,330
All right.<i> New York
versus Rottenburg, 1979.</i>

792
00:58:11,399 --> 00:58:16,871
What was the relevant passage of the
judge's decision? Don't smile at me.

George is running a fever and I want
to see him before he goes to bed.

821
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,945
Let me drive you. No, it's okay.
I can take a bus.

822
01:00:20,014 --> 01:00:22,848
Sarah, don't be a martyr.

823
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:25,685
I'm not a martyr. I've just

<i>Grandma and grandpa Walker, this is my
friend, mark Watson. Glad to know you, mark.</i>

831
01:00:50,548 --> 01:00:53,482
Sarah, here's a letter from
your mom and your dad.

832
01:00:53,552 --> 01:00:56,386
Come in this morning.
<i>Oh, grandpa, thank you.</i>

833
01:00:56,455 --> 01:00:58,756
Uh, I'll open it later.

834
01:00:58,824 --> 01:01:02,727
<i>Mark, you know that son of ours is
just so proud of this girl here.</i>

835
01:01:02,796 --> 01:01:06,231
<i>He writes to her every week just
to let her know how smart she is.</i>

836
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:08,567
I think it's just about gone to her head.

837
01:01:08,636 --> 01:01:11,470
I'll bet mark's people are
pretty proud of him too.

838
01:01:11,538 --> 01:01:15,408
<i>I bet they are. I bet they are too.</i>

839
01:01:18,446 --> 01:01:21,949
Me Quambo will destroy you.

840
01:01:27,056 --> 01:01:29,057
My circuits are damaged.

841
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:34,529
What do you mean you wanna
watch Johnny Carson?

842
01:01:34,598 --> 01:01:36,766
Sandra Macclosky gets to.

843
01:01:36,835 --> 01:01:40,103
Well, George Walker goes to
bed at 8:30 and that's that.

844
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:42,105
Okay? Okay.

845
01:01:42,174 --> 01:01:44,574
So are you warm enough?
Yeah, I'm warm enough.

846
01:01:44,643 --> 01:01:46,911
All right, precious.

847
01:01:46,979 --> 01:01:48,913
Good night.

848
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:52,284
Joan rivers is hosting.

849
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:57,256
Joan rivers? What do you
mean Joan rivers is hosting?

850
01:01:57,325 --> 01:02:01,393
How do you know about Joan rivers?
Where do you get these things?

851
01:02:01,462 --> 01:02:05,866
Oh, Georgie. All right.

852
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:09,436
Okay. Good night.

853
01:02:09,504 --> 01:02:11,539
Good night.

854
01:02:12,775 --> 01:02:15,944
So George and I are at
the checkout counter,

855
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:17,947
and the girl goes,

856
01:02:18,015 --> 01:02:21,150
"if you have food stamps, I
need to see them first."

857
01:02:21,219 --> 01:02:23,152
And I look at her and I say,

858
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:26,890
"oh. And what if I have an
American express gold card?"

859
01:02:26,959 --> 01:02:29,059
You have an American express gold card?

860
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:32,163
Yes, in the glove compartment
of my Lamborghini.

861
01:02:36,236 --> 01:02:38,937
So how long were you married?

862
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:42,007
Two years.

863
01:02:42,076 --> 01:02:46,179
I don't know. I guess we
got married too young.

864
01:02:46,248 --> 01:02:49,582
But how can I regret it?
I wouldn't have George.

865
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,584
He's a great kid.

866
01:02:51,652 --> 01:02:53,587
He really keeps me going.

867
01:02:53,655 --> 01:02:57,524
I would never have had the courage to apply
to law school if it weren't for him.

868
01:02:57,593 --> 01:03:01,729
I want to give him everything.
You'll spoil him rotten.

869
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:05,800
Given half a chance.

870
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:07,803
So what about you?

871
01:03:07,872 --> 01:03:10,506
Any great romances in your past?

872
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:15,379
Not really.

873
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:21,485
I guess I just haven't gotten serious about
any of the girls I've had appointments with.

874
01:03:21,554 --> 01:03:24,055
Oh.

875
01:03:24,124 --> 01:03:28,727
What about the girl by the jello salad?
She sounded pretty serious to me.

876
01:03:28,796 --> 01:03:31,463
Whitney? Oh, god.

877
01:03:31,532 --> 01:03:34,366
No way. That's history.

878
01:03:39,141 --> 01:03:41,074
Oh, look.

879
01:03:43,879 --> 01:03:45,879
It's snowing.

880
01:03:49,085 --> 01:03:52,087
It's so beautiful.

881
01:03:52,156 --> 01:03:54,456
It's snowing.

882
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,361
<i>Hey. Are you okay?</i>

883
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:00,496
Yeah.

884
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:22,754
You'd think you'd never
seen it snow before.

885
01:04:22,823 --> 01:04:26,659
I haven't. I've seen it
on mountaintops, but

886
01:04:26,728 --> 01:04:30,964
I'm from San Diego. Really? I'm from L.A.

887
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,468
You are? Yeah.

888
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,070
Then you're the one. Which one?

889
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,274
The one who stole my scholarship,
the bouchard scholarship.

890
01:04:39,343 --> 01:04:41,310
I was next in line for that.

891
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:44,713
But they told me there were no other
applicants. From Los Angeles.

892
01:04:44,781 --> 01:04:47,683
But if no one in L.A. qualified,
they open it statewide.

893
01:04:47,752 --> 01:04:51,721
I checked two days before the deadline and
nobody had applied so I thought I had it.

894
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:54,725
And then you pop up and steal
it right from under me.

895
01:04:54,793 --> 01:04:56,927
I didn't know.

896
01:04:56,996 --> 01:05:00,865
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to make you feel bad.

897
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:02,867
I'm glad it was you.

898
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:08,107
Look at you. You're turning white.

899
01:05:19,221 --> 01:05:22,290
Come on, mark. Give yourself a break.
You didn't know.

900
01:05:22,359 --> 01:05:25,993
It doesn't matter. I still had no
right to take that scholarship.

901
01:05:26,063 --> 01:05:27,996
It's wrong.

902
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:30,699
<i>It's immoral.</i> Well, of course it is.

903
01:05:30,768 --> 01:05:33,335
"Of course it is"?

904
01:05:33,404 --> 01:05:35,505
<i>Well, then why the hell didn't you stop me?</i>

905
01:05:35,574 --> 01:05:41,144
Golden rule. Certainly wouldn't want you
interfering every time I did something immoral.

906
01:05:44,484 --> 01:05:47,651
<i>Hey, where you going? What?</i>
To turn myself in.

907
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,821
Mark, wait a minute. What
are you talking about?

908
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:02,001
Wait a minute. Mark. Mark,
what are you doing?

909
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:06,773
Mark, don't do this. Mark, come on.
Listen to me.

910
01:06:06,842 --> 01:06:08,976
Are you crazy?

911
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,087
Went off without his earmuffs again.

912
01:06:19,757 --> 01:06:22,358
Ah, how fortuitous, Mr. Watson.

913
01:06:22,427 --> 01:06:26,263
Do you have a moment? There is
something I need to discuss with you.

914
01:06:26,332 --> 01:06:31,002
<i>Don't worry, Bradley. It's a long semester.
Somebody will probably flunk out...</i>

915
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,438
Or die or something.

916
01:06:33,507 --> 01:06:35,806
Hey, look at this. What?

917
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:46,620
Mr. Watson,

918
01:06:46,688 --> 01:06:52,059
all ethical or disciplinary
problems within the law school...

919
01:06:52,128 --> 01:06:57,131
Are handled by a body known as the
student faculty judiciary committee

920
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,804
cheating, plagiarism, any sort of
dishonest or inappropriate behavior.

921
01:07:02,873 --> 01:07:06,809
Perhaps you were aware that I serve
as chairman on that committee.

922
01:07:06,878 --> 01:07:09,745
Uh, no, sir.

923
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:15,686
The judiciary committee is called upon
to make some difficult decisions.

924
01:07:15,754 --> 01:07:19,557
It can be an unpleasant responsibility.

925
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:24,862
Periodically, we're called upon to recommend
punitive actions against a student.

926
01:07:24,931 --> 01:07:27,433
Punitive actions, sir?

927
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:31,737
Suspension. In some cases, expulsion.

928
01:07:31,806 --> 01:07:36,910
<i>In fact, last year our judgment on
a case actually led one student...</i>

929
01:07:36,978 --> 01:07:40,514
To file civil suit against
a fellow student,

930
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:45,086
a suit which proved financially
devastating to the guilty party.

931
01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:47,522
Devastating?

932
01:07:47,591 --> 01:07:50,125
Yes. I see.

933
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:53,762
And in another instance,
our findings obliged us...

934
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:57,467
To file criminal charges against a student.

935
01:07:57,536 --> 01:08:03,374
He was convicted of felony fraud and sentenced
to five years in the state penitentiary.

936
01:08:03,443 --> 01:08:07,845
His reputation and future were
of course utterly destroyed.

937
01:08:07,913 --> 01:08:11,416
Of course, utterly.

938
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:16,222
Mr. Watson, an unfortunate situation
has come to my attention,

939
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:20,393
one that is of particular concern to the
black students here at the law school.

940
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:23,096
Look, professor, I know
what you're getting at.

941
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:25,605
I swear to god I was gonna come
talk to you about this myself.

942
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:27,568
Good.

943
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,670
You will have my recommendation.

944
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,874
Your recommendation?

945
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:36,811
You need a faculty recommendation to
apply for a seat on the committee.

946
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,515
Oh.

947
01:08:39,584 --> 01:08:42,918
<i>We'd like to maintain the current level
of black representation on the committee.</i>

948
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:45,155
Naturally we were concerned
when we learned that...

949
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:48,759
Our only black student member
was taking a leave of absence.

950
01:08:48,827 --> 01:08:50,761
Well.

951
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:56,267
I've been extremely impressed by the way
your work has improved over the semester.

952
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:58,270
I think you will do a good job.

953
01:08:58,339 --> 01:09:02,441
Thank you, sir.

954
01:09:11,653 --> 01:09:15,389
There's something else you wish
to discuss with me, Mr. Watson?

955
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:19,594
Uh, no, sir.

956
01:09:19,663 --> 01:09:22,731
No, sir, that would be it.

957
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,833
Thank you.

958
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,954
Hi, Karim, how are

959
01:09:45,091 --> 01:09:48,594
sorry, I guess you can't

960
01:09:48,663 --> 01:09:51,263
say "hi" to Gordon for us.

961
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:00,674
You know sign language. What did he say?

962
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:04,545
Well, I could be getting a little
rusty, but I swear he said,

963
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:07,982
"your nose is happy like the moon."

964
01:10:09,854 --> 01:10:12,954
What happened? Did you tell banks?

965
01:10:13,023 --> 01:10:16,125
No, I didn't. I chickened out.

966
01:10:16,194 --> 01:10:18,795
You know, gordo, I could
probably go to jail for this.

967
01:10:18,864 --> 01:10:20,797
Of course you could go to jail for this.

968
01:10:20,866 --> 01:10:26,103
What do you mean, "of course
I could go" never mind.

969
01:10:27,106 --> 01:10:29,039
Gordon, tell me what to do.

970
01:10:29,108 --> 01:10:31,510
Go to your room. What?

971
01:10:31,578 --> 01:10:36,147
Just go over there, open the
door and look in your room.

972
01:10:40,688 --> 01:10:43,690
Jesus Christ. What did
you let her in here for?

973
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:46,326
Sarah's coming over here to study.
She'll be here any minute.

974
01:10:46,395 --> 01:10:49,062
Golden rule again. I certainly
wouldn't want you interfering...

975
01:10:49,131 --> 01:10:52,500
If there were a beautiful, half-naked
girl curled up on my bed.

976
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:55,102
Oh, god. Oh, god.

977
01:10:55,171 --> 01:10:57,104
Okay. What? Mark.

978
01:10:57,173 --> 01:11:02,044
Promise me you wouldn't interfere if there
were a half-naked girl curled up on my bed.

979
01:11:02,112 --> 01:11:04,881
Hi. Hi, mark.

980
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:06,883
Whitney, what are you doing here?

981
01:11:06,952 --> 01:11:09,052
Finding out if there's
any hope for the world.

982
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:14,158
What? Seriously, mark. If
two young, intelligent,

983
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:17,829
sexually compatible people can't
work out their differences,

984
01:11:17,897 --> 01:11:20,231
what hope is there for lasting world peace?

985
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:25,236
Who gives a shit. Whitney, you
gotta get out of here. Mark, mark.

986
01:11:25,305 --> 01:11:28,708
Please, please. At least give me a chance.

987
01:11:28,777 --> 01:11:31,578
Believe me, I understand what
your people have been through.

988
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:36,116
You have no idea what my
people have been through.

989
01:11:36,185 --> 01:11:38,619
What am I saying?

990
01:11:38,688 --> 01:11:42,791
Okay, look. Stay here.

991
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,993
Don't go out of this room. Okay.

992
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:49,632
Don't open that! Why not?

993
01:11:49,701 --> 01:11:51,634
It's Sarah. Wait a minute.

994
01:11:51,703 --> 01:11:54,070
Let me think. What can I tell her?

995
01:11:54,139 --> 01:11:56,272
Don't tell her anything.
But I already told her.

996
01:11:56,341 --> 01:11:58,341
What, that you're white? No,
that I'm not seeing Whitney.

997
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,744
Does Whitney know you're white?
No, I gotta get rid of her.

998
01:12:00,814 --> 01:12:02,881
How are you gonna get rid of her?
I'll tell her I'm white.

999
01:12:02,949 --> 01:12:05,282
Don't tell her you're white! You're right.

1000
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:07,619
I can't tell her I'm white.
What am I gonna tell her?

1001
01:12:07,687 --> 01:12:10,022
Wait a minute. You need to think.
Let me think.

1002
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:14,793
<i>Mark, why don't you let us in?</i>
It's your parents.

1003
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,564
Oh, god. <i>Mark?</i>

1004
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:22,302
Okay, okay, okay.

1005
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:26,373
Okay. They can't see me like this.
Stall them.

1006
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,442
Okay.

1007
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:32,414
So, Mr. and Mrs. Watson,
how do you find Boston?

1008
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:35,517
A lot of people compare it to a
European city, but that's so stupid.

1009
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:37,620
I mean, all the signs are in English.

1010
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:41,257
Would you please get dressed?
Please get dressed.

1011
01:12:41,325 --> 01:12:44,127
Mark. Mark.

1012
01:12:44,196 --> 01:12:46,697
I've always said, and you can
check my record on this,

1013
01:12:46,766 --> 01:12:49,199
that if everyone learned to speak English,

1014
01:12:49,268 --> 01:12:52,571
there would be a lot fewer wars
and a lot more spelling bees.

1015
01:12:52,639 --> 01:12:56,340
Shut up, Gordon. Where the hell is mark?
Yes, sir. You bet.

1016
01:12:56,409 --> 01:12:59,946
Well, I tell you, sir. I know a few marks.
Can you give me a little more to go on?

1017
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:06,119
Mom, dad, tell me, what brings you
to this wintry part of the country?

1018
01:13:06,188 --> 01:13:08,755
We decided to stop over on
our way back from Barbados.

1019
01:13:08,824 --> 01:13:11,559
Mark, what are you doing with
that thing on your head?

1020
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:14,729
This? Uh <i>yes.</i>

1021
01:13:14,798 --> 01:13:17,131
Germs. Filthy bacteria.

1022
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,735
<i>My mucous membranes are infested with them.</i>

1023
01:13:19,804 --> 01:13:24,106
Scientists now believe that a simple ski mask
can stop the senseless spread of disease.

1024
01:13:24,174 --> 01:13:27,243
Harvard scientists. I
wanna see my baby's face.

1025
01:13:27,312 --> 01:13:31,748
No, mom. You say that, but
believe me, you don't mean it.

1026
01:13:31,817 --> 01:13:36,687
We would like to talk to you, mark,
openly, honestly, privately.

1027
01:13:36,756 --> 01:13:38,756
<i>Your father's therapist
thinks that he may have...</i>

1028
01:13:38,825 --> 01:13:41,827
Moved out of his integrity life
phase and into generativity.

1029
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:44,062
Shut up, Dorothy. Mark,
could we go somewhere

1030
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:46,332
why don't the three of us
go out for a little drink?

1031
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,802
On second thought, why don't
we go in the kitchen?

1032
01:13:53,308 --> 01:13:56,410
Hi, Sarah. Hi

1033
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:58,912
hi, Sarah. Hi. Hi. Hi.

1034
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:02,750
How are you? Mark's uh fine. Where's mark?

1035
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:07,856
Uh, uh, what's the phrase I'm looking for?
Not here. That's it. Mark's not here.

1036
01:14:09,293 --> 01:14:12,795
Hi, Sarah. You ready to go to the library?

1037
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,064
The library? I thought we
were gonna study here.

1038
01:14:15,133 --> 01:14:17,534
Uh, I changed my mind.

1039
01:14:17,602 --> 01:14:21,439
Studying here makes me so... sleepy.

1040
01:14:21,507 --> 01:14:25,142
Well, I gave grandma the number here and she's
gonna call me if George's fever goes up.

1041
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,144
How about if I make a pot of coffee? No!

1042
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:31,282
I mean, hey, sit down, relax.

1043
01:14:31,352 --> 01:14:33,518
Let me do the work.

1044
01:14:37,692 --> 01:14:39,142
We're defrosting.

1045
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,988
Mark, what I'm trying to say is

1046
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:54,526
what your father means to say is, dear, even
though he seems like a real shithead sometimes,

1047
01:14:54,595 --> 01:14:57,163
he loves you very much. Oh,
shut up, Dorothy. Mark

1048
01:14:57,231 --> 01:15:01,267
<i>mark? Mark?</i> Who was that?

1049
01:15:01,336 --> 01:15:04,037
Uh, neighbors.

1050
01:15:04,106 --> 01:15:06,106
Very thin walls.

1051
01:15:06,175 --> 01:15:09,643
Somebody yelled "mark." Excuse me.

1052
01:15:09,712 --> 01:15:14,148
Mark, I was just wondering<i> ♫</i>

1053
01:15:14,217 --> 01:15:18,688
<i>♪ east coast girls are hip ♪</i>

1054
01:15:18,756 --> 01:15:20,690
Is that coming from your room? <i>♫</i>

1055
01:15:20,758 --> 01:15:24,360
That? That.

1056
01:15:24,429 --> 01:15:26,363
Oh, that.

1057
01:15:26,432 --> 01:15:28,365
That's my stereo.

1058
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:31,736
<i>Automatic alarm timer. You
see, I was taking a nap...</i>

1059
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:36,273
And I especially picked this music so I'd be
forced to get out of bed and turn it off.

1060
01:15:36,343 --> 01:15:39,345
Pretty smart, huh?

1061
01:15:39,413 --> 01:15:43,048
This is shit. These guys really suck.

1062
01:15:43,116 --> 01:15:45,317
Then I'll just go turn it off. No!

1063
01:15:45,386 --> 01:15:48,655
What? It's too messy in there.
Right, gordo?

1064
01:15:48,724 --> 01:15:51,924
<i>Almost beyond human comprehension.</i>

1065
01:15:51,993 --> 01:15:55,429
<i>I think the water's boiling.</i>

1066
01:15:57,834 --> 01:16:00,068
Get back, Dorothy. I'll handle this.

1067
01:16:00,136 --> 01:16:02,371
I'm warning you. I'm armed.

1068
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:07,042
What's happening, brother?
Get down, get down.

1069
01:16:07,111 --> 01:16:12,348
Looking good, mama. Looking good.
I gots to be goin' now.

1070
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:15,452
Did he have a knife? I
think he had a knife.

1071
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:19,456
<i>♫ mark, what's going on?</i>

1072
01:16:19,525 --> 01:16:23,728
Mark, I think she's on to you.

1073
01:16:23,797 --> 01:16:26,931
You better tell her the truth.

1074
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,969
Okay. The truth.

1075
01:16:31,038 --> 01:16:33,939
<i>Sarah, the truth is</i>

1076
01:16:34,008 --> 01:16:38,945
the truth is, Sarah, that mark just...

1077
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:42,917
Bought your Christmas present and if you go
into the room, you're gonna see what it is.

1078
01:16:42,985 --> 01:16:47,922
Tell you what. I'll go turn the music off.

1079
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:50,392
I already know what I'm getting.

1080
01:16:52,897 --> 01:16:57,934
I feel terrible. I haven't
gotten you anything.

1081
01:16:58,002 --> 01:17:01,270
Please, don't feel terrible. It's nothing.

1082
01:17:01,339 --> 01:17:03,273
Really, nothing at all.

1083
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:07,144
<i>♫</i> but maybe I should go hide it.

1084
01:17:07,212 --> 01:17:09,179
Just in case.

1085
01:17:10,951 --> 01:17:14,586
Damn. You never have flash
bulbs when you need them.

1086
01:17:16,022 --> 01:17:18,383
Could you just scoot over there
by the window, sweetheart?

1087
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:26,867
Oh, where are we going?

1088
01:17:34,878 --> 01:17:37,278
Holy chowder.

1089
01:17:37,347 --> 01:17:41,717
<i>I'm gonna check on that coffee.</i> Why
don't you go check on that coffee?

1090
01:17:41,786 --> 01:17:43,953
I'm gonna go check on that coffee.

1091
01:17:44,021 --> 01:17:45,956
What was that?

1092
01:17:46,024 --> 01:17:48,892
What? Is there someone in the kitchen?

1093
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:52,129
Is somebody in the kitchen?

1094
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:54,231
No, nobody's in the kitchen.

1095
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,367
It's okay, Dorothy. Then
who are these people?

1096
01:17:56,435 --> 01:18:00,906
These people? I don't know
who these people are.

1097
01:18:00,975 --> 01:18:03,141
How did you get in my kitchen?
What's the meaning of this?

1098
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:06,479
What are you talking about, dear?

1099
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:09,148
Hi, we're mark's parents.

1100
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:13,821
<i>I'm Dorothy Watson and
this is my husband, bill.</i>

1101
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,689
Mark?

1102
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,825
Sarah,

1103
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:21,763
the truth is these people are

1104
01:18:21,832 --> 01:18:24,766
these people are obviously total lunatics.

1105
01:18:24,835 --> 01:18:26,768
I've heard about this sort of thing.

1106
01:18:26,837 --> 01:18:30,673
<i>Older people are going insane with
anxiety about their financial futures.</i>

1107
01:18:30,742 --> 01:18:36,547
So they accost some promising young professional
student and claim to be his parents.

1108
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:41,853
Apparently, it's just another result of
these Reagan budget cuts. Now, shoo, shoo.

1109
01:18:41,922 --> 01:18:47,291
I'm sorry, but while we agree with you
philosophically, we can't help you here.

1110
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,631
Try the mission. Mark, can I speak
to you in your room for a moment?

1111
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,234
Please.

1112
01:18:55,303 --> 01:18:58,705
Gordon. So, how were the islands?

1113
01:19:05,014 --> 01:19:07,114
Uh, yeah, Mr. Dunbar?

1114
01:19:07,183 --> 01:19:10,652
Mark, are you in trouble?

1115
01:19:10,721 --> 01:19:14,790
No, it's not that. You're obviously hiding
more than a Christmas present here.

1116
01:19:14,858 --> 01:19:17,460
If you want me to leave, just tell me. No.

1117
01:19:17,528 --> 01:19:21,097
No, Sarah. Just tell me the truth.

1118
01:19:21,165 --> 01:19:25,102
Sarah, I really care about you a lot.
That's why I can't tell you the truth.

1119
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:30,709
What are you talking about?

1120
01:19:30,777 --> 01:19:33,478
How do you feel about
interracial relationships?

1121
01:19:33,546 --> 01:19:36,848
Pardon me? Interracial relationships.

1122
01:19:36,917 --> 01:19:39,785
You know, relationships between
persons of different races.

1123
01:19:45,828 --> 01:19:47,761
Why are you asking me this?

1124
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:52,433
Mark, I'm coming back in now.
It's freezing out there.

1125
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:54,902
<i>Sarah, wait a minute.</i> There he is again.
Stand back.

1126
01:19:54,971 --> 01:19:58,006
Shut up, dad. You don't
owe me any explanation.

1127
01:19:58,074 --> 01:20:00,042
Yes, I do, Sarah. Listen to me.

1128
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:04,279
There's nothing between Whitney and me.
She likes me because I'm black.

1129
01:20:04,348 --> 01:20:06,549
I mean, because she thinks I'm black.

1130
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:09,385
I mean, when I got involved
with her, I was really white...

1131
01:20:09,454 --> 01:20:12,221
On the inside, although I
was black on the outside.

1132
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:16,661
But now a part of me is black on the inside
even though I'm white on the outside.

1133
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:21,667
I don't know. Maybe I'm sort of
gray on the inside and the outside.

1134
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:25,637
Sarah, what I'm trying to say
to you is I'm actually white.

1135
01:20:25,706 --> 01:20:29,508
<i>Oh, I see. And these people
are actually your parents.</i>

1136
01:20:29,577 --> 01:20:31,678
Right. What?

1137
01:20:31,746 --> 01:20:37,184
Oh, yeah. Mom, dad, there's something
I have to tell you. I'm black.

1138
01:20:37,252 --> 01:20:39,553
No, you're crazy.

1139
01:20:42,726 --> 01:20:44,492
Kids.

1140
01:20:55,007 --> 01:20:57,074
Sarah, wait a Se

1141
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:15,627
hi.

1142
01:21:15,697 --> 01:21:17,663
Oh, Marky.

1143
01:21:17,733 --> 01:21:20,867
Broken bones? No.

1144
01:21:20,936 --> 01:21:24,271
Internal bleeding?

1145
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:28,542
Hard to say. I guess that's why
they call it internal bleeding.

1146
01:21:33,516 --> 01:21:36,786
Have a nice day, boys.

1147
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:59,311
<i>Please pick up your exam
booklets at the door.</i>

1148
01:22:01,115 --> 01:22:04,549
Sarah, listen.

1149
01:22:04,618 --> 01:22:06,619
I just wanna say

1150
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:15,163
I just wanna say...

1151
01:22:15,231 --> 01:22:17,165
Good luck.

1152
01:22:25,109 --> 01:22:27,277

1171
01:23:59,683 --> 01:24:04,404
I can't. I gotta stay here and
figure out what I'm gonna do.

1172
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:07,407
So what are you gonna do?

1173
01:24:07,476 --> 01:24:10,810
<i>Sorry, dumb question.</i>

1174
01:24:14,016 --> 01:24:16,584
I don't know, Gordon.

1175
01:24:16,653 --> 01:24:19,321
I never thought all this would

1176
01:24:23,276 --> 01:24:26,863
I never thought I'd fall in love with her.

1177
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:31,751
Shit, I never thought about anything.

1178
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:37,024
You know what I mean? Yeah, I think I do...

1179
01:24:37,093 --> 01:24:39,193
Maybe...

1180
01:24:39,262 --> 01:24:41,396
Sort of

1181
01:24:41,465 --> 01:24:46,134
I mean, I guess you've been
through a lot of stuff.

1182
01:24:46,203 --> 01:24:49,272
Probably a lot of stuff
I can't even imagine.

1183
01:24:52,077 --> 01:24:54,278
Do you really<i> hate</i> the beach boys now?

1184
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:02,053
It's hard to say.

1185
01:25:02,122 --> 01:25:07,325
I guess I still like some
of their funkier stuff.

1186
01:25:11,132 --> 01:25:13,799
You better get out of here.
Your plane's gonna leave.

1187
01:25:13,868 --> 01:25:15,802
Right.

1188
01:25:22,379 --> 01:25:24,312
Merry Christmas.

1189
01:25:24,381 --> 01:25:26,514
You too.

1190
01:25:39,998 --> 01:25:43,467
What am I gonna do?

1191
01:25:43,536 --> 01:25:48,072
<i>We're two brilliant young men.
We've got energy, imagination,</i>

1192
01:25:48,141 --> 01:25:51,276
keen analytical minds.

1193
01:25:51,345 --> 01:25:53,345
We'll think of something.

1194
01:26:04,293 --> 01:26:08,195
The judiciary committee will
convene in two minutes.

1195
01:26:21,546 --> 01:26:24,146
Hey, booey. Hey, barky.

1196
01:26:24,215 --> 01:26:26,216
How you been? How was your vacation?
Excellent.

1197
01:26:26,251 --> 01:26:28,685
Terrific. You going to the special hearing?

1198
01:26:28,753 --> 01:26:32,123
You kidding? I wouldn't miss this for
the world. I wonder what he did.

1199
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:37,661
My guess is he falsified his transcripts
or cheated on his l.S.A.T.'S.

1200
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:42,701
No, believe me, my interest in
him is purely sociological.

1201
01:26:42,769 --> 01:26:45,070
Oops, excuse me.

1202
01:26:45,139 --> 01:26:48,541
What are they gonna do to him? It's hard
to say. Nobody knows what he's done.

1203
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:51,844
I got Travis and Kelly down
for expulsion at six to one.

1204
01:26:51,913 --> 01:26:53,947
You want some action or what?

1205
01:26:54,016 --> 01:26:57,284
Because, you know, I really don't
feel like there's any red or white...

1206
01:26:57,353 --> 01:27:00,188
Only shades of pink.

1207
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,757
All be seated please.

1208
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:11,700
<i>If Mr. Watson will come
forward, we can begin.</i>

1209
01:27:16,542 --> 01:27:19,843
It appears that Mr. Watson has
reconsidered his decision.

1210
01:27:19,911 --> 01:27:25,049
I'd say this whole thing is an argument against
these affirmative action scholarships.

1211
01:27:26,119 --> 01:27:28,053
Just a moment, your honor.

1212
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:35,162
<i>Young man, I am the chairman
of a committee, not a judge.</i>

1213
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:40,167
Oh, right, your... chairiness.

1214
01:27:40,235 --> 01:27:43,604
I'm Gordon Bloomfeld, Mr. Watson's
chief counsel in this matter.

1215
01:27:43,673 --> 01:27:47,241
Are we to understand that Mr. Watson
himself was not inclined to attend today?

1216
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:49,478
Objection.

1217
01:27:49,547 --> 01:27:53,182
To what? Well.

1218
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,152
Frankly, to your tone of voice.

1219
01:27:56,221 --> 01:27:58,354
Quiet.

1220
01:27:58,423 --> 01:28:02,158
Mr. Bloomfeld, these proceedings
are highly irregular as it is.

1221
01:28:02,227 --> 01:28:05,095
If Mr. Watson will not
come forward in person,

1222
01:28:05,164 --> 01:28:08,265
we'll have to adjourn this hearing
and conduct our own investigation.

1223
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:13,538
My client is more than ready
to come forward in person.

1224
01:28:13,607 --> 01:28:15,540
But first

1225
01:28:15,609 --> 01:28:21,347
first he has asked that I make a
few brief remarks on his behalf.

1226
01:28:25,053 --> 01:28:27,153
Mark feels that he has
done a grave injustice...

1227
01:28:27,223 --> 01:28:31,426
In accepting the Henry Q.
Bouchard memorial fellowship.

1228
01:28:31,494 --> 01:28:34,995
His sole desire is to set
the record straight...

1229
01:28:35,064 --> 01:28:39,868
And to make the fullest possible
reparations for the damage he has done.

1230
01:28:39,937 --> 01:28:41,870
First,

1231
01:28:41,939 --> 01:28:47,143
to the individual who otherwise
would have received those funds.

1232
01:28:47,212 --> 01:28:49,145
But also,

1233
01:28:49,214 --> 01:28:53,618
to the institution whose
trust he has forsaken.

1234
01:28:54,754 --> 01:28:59,458
And last, but by no means least,

1235
01:28:59,526 --> 01:29:03,395
to the society whose laws
he has transgressed.

1236
01:29:15,077 --> 01:29:20,147
In thus coming forward, my client throws
himself upon the mercy of this committee.

1237
01:29:21,351 --> 01:29:24,252
But I ask you,

1238
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:26,254
<i>before you pass judgment on him,</i>

1239
01:29:26,323 --> 01:29:29,625
<i>I ask you to consider the mitigating
circumstances surrounding his crime.</i>

1240
01:29:29,694 --> 01:29:33,296
I hate this bleeding heart shit.

1241
01:29:33,364 --> 01:29:36,266
My client was in a position
of dire financial need...

1242
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:40,737
At the time he improperly
accepted the bouchard fellowship.

1243
01:29:40,806 --> 01:29:43,374
In his efforts to come
by the money honestly,

1244
01:29:43,443 --> 01:29:48,514
he encountered nothing but hostility
and rejection at every turn.

1245
01:29:48,582 --> 01:29:53,719
In fact, one could argue that it was the lack
of understanding of my client's special needs,

1246
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:56,989
on the part of the
governmental, financial...

1247
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,627
And academic establishments
that drove him to his crime.

1248
01:30:02,565 --> 01:30:07,802
But it goes way beyond that,
ladies and gentlemen.

1249
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:10,572
Yes, my client is a victim of society...

1250
01:30:10,641 --> 01:30:14,843
In a still deeper sense.

1251
01:30:18,249 --> 01:30:22,852
After all, who made him what he is?

1252
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,055
Weak,

1253
01:30:25,123 --> 01:30:29,526
greedy, unable to support
himself by honest labor.

1254
01:30:31,465 --> 01:30:34,766
Can we blame him for the environment
in which he was raised?

1255
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:41,440
For the warped values which he
learned from earliest childhood?

1256
01:30:41,509 --> 01:30:45,311
For the people with whom he was surrounded?

1257
01:30:45,381 --> 01:30:50,116
People who, as much as
it pains me to say it,

1258
01:30:50,185 --> 01:30:53,287
give daily evidence of
underdeveloped intellect...

1259
01:30:53,356 --> 01:30:56,957
<i>And deteriorating moral fiber.</i>

1260
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:00,462
In short,

1261
01:31:00,531 --> 01:31:04,533
can we blame him, ladies and gentlemen,

1262
01:31:04,602 --> 01:31:07,871
for the color of his skin?

1263
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,014
I think not.

1264
01:31:22,823 --> 01:31:25,624
And I trust that this
committee will find the heart

1265
01:31:25,692 --> 01:31:29,495
nay, the soul

1266
01:31:29,564 --> 01:31:31,664
to be lenient...

1267
01:31:31,733 --> 01:31:33,699
And to share with me my hope...

1268
01:31:33,768 --> 01:31:38,104
That despite his race and upbringing,

1269
01:31:38,173 --> 01:31:40,407
my client may yet become...

1270
01:31:40,476 --> 01:31:44,746
A useful member of society.

1271
01:32:01,066 --> 01:32:03,000
Mark Watson,

1272
01:32:03,069 --> 01:32:05,402
come on down!

1273
01:32:21,289 --> 01:32:24,157
No wonder. No wonder.

1274
01:32:24,226 --> 01:32:27,127
No wonder. No wonder.

1275
01:32:27,196 --> 01:32:31,633
<i>I have important information for this
committee. I have pictures. I have proof.</i>

1276
01:32:31,702 --> 01:32:35,403
Mark Watson is actually... white.

1277
01:32:52,726 --> 01:32:56,160
All right. I'm listening.

1278
01:32:56,229 --> 01:33:01,266
First of all, I'd like to pay miss Walker
the full amount of my Grant, plus interest.

1279
01:33:01,335 --> 01:33:06,472
And? I'd like to volunteer one day
a week during my school year...

1280
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:08,508
And all of my summer vacations...

1281
01:33:08,577 --> 01:33:12,346
To legal aid work in the
black community. And?

1282
01:33:14,517 --> 01:33:16,918
And I'd like to have a contract drawn up...

1283
01:33:16,986 --> 01:33:21,823
<i>Binding me to donate a fixed percentage
of my annual income after law school...</i>

1284
01:33:21,892 --> 01:33:25,376
Towards the establishment of a scholarship
in the name of Sarah Jane Walker.

1285
01:33:25,445 --> 01:33:29,015
And?

1286
01:33:32,219 --> 01:33:34,621
And...

1287
01:33:37,425 --> 01:33:40,895
I would like to get a law degree, sir.

1288
01:33:40,964 --> 01:33:45,733
So I can do some work that
might be of use to somebody.

1289
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:54,076
You must have learned a great deal more than
you bargained for through this experience.

1290
01:33:54,145 --> 01:33:57,013
Yes, sir.

1291
01:33:58,016 --> 01:34:00,116
<i>Mr. Watson,</i>

1292
01:34:00,185 --> 01:34:05,589
a Harvard law graduate can
do a great many things

1293
01:34:05,658 --> 01:34:09,928
make a lot of money,

1294
01:34:09,997 --> 01:34:13,565
teach, become a senator,

1295
01:34:13,633 --> 01:34:16,268
a judge.

1296
01:34:16,337 --> 01:34:21,140
A Harvard law graduate...

1297
01:34:21,209 --> 01:34:23,844
Has power, Mr. Watson.

1298
01:34:23,913 --> 01:34:26,814
<i>I hope that I teach my students...</i>

1299
01:34:26,882 --> 01:34:30,719
<i>To use that power responsibly,</i>

1300
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:33,722
<i>even generously.</i>

1301
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:36,992
<i>But you've learned something
that I can't teach them.</i>

1302
01:34:37,061 --> 01:34:39,995
You've learned what it
feels like to be black.

1303
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,102
No, sir. I beg your pardon?

1304
01:34:46,504 --> 01:34:50,006
I don't really know what
it feels like, sir.

1305
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:55,312
If I didn't like it, I
could always get out.

1306
01:34:58,619 --> 01:35:00,986
It's not the same, sir.

1307
01:35:08,463 --> 01:35:10,864
You have learned a great
deal more than I thought.

1308
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:24,913
We won't press charges. You can stay.

1309
01:35:24,982 --> 01:35:27,516
Thank you, sir.

1310
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:44,602
What do you think, George?

1311
01:35:44,671 --> 01:35:47,239
Go ahead.

1312
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,399
Hi.

1313
01:36:15,406 --> 01:36:17,340
Hi.

1314
01:36:18,977 --> 01:36:21,057
George, why don't you put
something on the jukebox?

1315
01:36:23,149 --> 01:36:25,082
You look funny white.

1316
01:36:25,151 --> 01:36:29,487
Yeah? Well, green's my best
color, but everybody stares.

1317
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:47,841
Did you, uh did you get my check?

1318
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:49,509
Yes, thank you.

1319
01:36:49,578 --> 01:36:53,081
That's everything. That's all the money
I got last semester, plus interest.

1320
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:56,351
What did you do, fake a seizure and get
a Grant from the heart foundation?

1321
01:36:58,256 --> 01:37:00,389
I sold my car and stuff.

1322
01:37:03,094 --> 01:37:06,696
My father finally agreed to give me a loan.

1323
01:37:06,765 --> 01:37:09,366
Twenty-five percent interest.

1324
01:37:12,105 --> 01:37:14,205
But at least I can stay in school.

1325
01:37:14,274 --> 01:37:16,874
I'm happy for you, mark. If
you'll excuse me. <i>Sarah.</i>

1326
01:37:21,282 --> 01:37:26,152
I know how bad you needed that "a" on banks'
final. And I know how much it meant to you.

1327
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:29,789
Fine, want to know? I'm sorry

1328
01:37:29,857 --> 01:37:33,493
let's find out. Did she
flunk or did she pass?

1329
01:37:33,562 --> 01:37:35,495
She got an "a," okay? She got an "a."

1330
01:37:35,564 --> 01:37:39,834
<i>Are you happy? Are you happy with yourself?</i>

1331
01:37:42,306 --> 01:37:44,339
I got an "a."

1332
01:37:44,408 --> 01:37:47,310
"A" minus. That's not bad.

1333
01:37:53,885 --> 01:37:57,220
I guess I could have used a study partner.

1334
01:38:01,094 --> 01:38:03,094
Sarah...

1335
01:38:05,298 --> 01:38:07,232
You never answered my question.

1336
01:38:11,405 --> 01:38:14,341
You know, how you feel about
interracial relationships.

1337
01:38:20,415 --> 01:38:24,285
What? What were you gonna say?

1338
01:38:31,862 --> 01:38:36,732
I was going to say that I've never
met a white man I was interested in.

1339
01:38:40,638 --> 01:38:43,240
And that

1340
01:38:43,309 --> 01:38:46,877
and that I guess the experience
is just too different.

1341
01:38:46,945 --> 01:38:49,814
We've gotta go now, honey.

1342
01:39:01,396 --> 01:39:04,231
Excuse me.

1343
01:39:04,299 --> 01:39:06,333
What do you call a black test-tube baby?

1344
01:39:06,402 --> 01:39:09,002
<i>Janitor in a drum.</i>

1345
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:12,806
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

1346
01:39:24,423 --> 01:39:26,822
No offense.

1347
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:54,455
But

1348
01:39:54,523 --> 01:39:56,523
but what?

1349
01:39:58,727 --> 01:40:03,231
But but I guess it's all right,

1350
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:05,400
interracial relationships.

1351
01:40:13,712 --> 01:40:17,581
If two people really
care about each other.

1352
01:40:17,649 --> 01:40:19,716
Right, George?

1353
01:40:19,784 --> 01:40:22,220
Yep.

1354
01:40:22,288 --> 01:40:24,222
Yeah?

1355
01:40:25,825 --> 01:40:28,927
Yeah.

1356
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:36,336
Come on, George and I will buy you dinner.

1357
01:40:36,404 --> 01:40:38,371
You gotta eat, right?

1358
01:40:43,146 --> 01:40:46,247
<i>Sarah, this is Harvard.
I don't have to eat.</i>

1359
01:40:46,315 --> 01:40:50,385
I don't have to sleep.
I just have to study.
