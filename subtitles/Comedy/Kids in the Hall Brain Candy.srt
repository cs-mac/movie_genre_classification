1
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,393
This is so good.

2
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,464
I want more.

3
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,259
Don't get greedy.

4
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,699
Jeff?

5
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,827
Hayley.

6
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,929
Sorry.

7
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,974
I was gonna be, like,
so sophisticated when we met.

8
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,307
Little hard to do that with your mouth
full of... whatever that is.

9
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,846
It's great. It's great.
Do you want some?

10
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,142
Sure.

11
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,052
Yum.

12
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,986
It's, um... kind of
what I was thinking.

13
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,124
Sorry?

14
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:26,928
You just don't look like the kind of guy
who has to meet girls over the internet.

15
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,332
I think it's better to meet people
online first sometimes.

16
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,495
You get to know
what they're like inside.

17
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,200
When you work as a photographer
you find out real quick, people's faces lie.

18
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,010
Does my face lie?

19
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,775
I look at those eyes
and I see...

20
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,185
a girl who reads Zadie Smith,

21
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,949
who listens to John Mayer
and ColdPlay,

22
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,787
who loves Monty Python episodes

23
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,656
and who, desperately,

24
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,856
madly, deeply, wants,

25
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:04,426
needs, longs for...
more chocolate.

26
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,168
Excellent, excellent
judge of character.

27
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,510
Can I get two of those truffles

28
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,645
and two ganaches.

29
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,774
Now what's a ganache?

30
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,085
You don't know
what a ganache is?

31
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,316
Lucky, you're with
a woman of the world

32
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,983
to introduce you to these things.

33
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,085
And two chocolate-covered hearts.

34
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,859
And a decaf latte for me.

35
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:32,931
- And...?
- I'm good.

36
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,134
Yeah, you do appear so.

37
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,967
So what's in the bag?

38
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:42,973
Oh, you know,

39
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,634
just, like, books and stuff.

40
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,840
I figured if you stood me up,
then I should have something to read.

41
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,815
Well... I couldn't really decide.

42
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,117
I'm reading this book
about Jean Seberg.

43
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,952
She's this actress
who slept with all the wrong people

44
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,617
and ended up killing herself.

45
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,086
Don't you do that.

46
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,298
No. I intend to sleep
with all the right people.

47
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,103
Plus, I'm reading Romeo and Juliet.

48
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,604
It's a ninth grade book,

49
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,233
but I figured I could have it done
before the school year starts, so...

50
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,072
Doesn't look like
Elizabethan tragedy.

51
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,115
No, that's 'cause...

52
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,550
Well, my dad... he's letting me audit
one of his med school courses, right?

53
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,484
I don't really understand
half of it,

54
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,353
but I totally love it.

55
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,921
What?

56
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,754
So you go to UCW

57
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,160
and you sit in a lecture hall
with all these grad students

58
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:41,290
and, what,
do they hit on you?

59
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,366
Why? Are you jealous?

60
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,497
Just admiring. I didn't know
you were interested in that kind of thing.

61
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,607
What?

62
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,235
You thought since we'd been chatting
for three weeks

63
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,371
that you knew everything about me?

64
00:06:55,481 --> 00:07:01,010
Plus, they wouldn't hit on a 14-year-old girl.
They're old enough to be my dad, so...

65
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,083
They're like...

66
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,057
They're bad older.
They're... You're not...

67
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,227
I'm so articulate.

68
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,093
Sorry. Can I just, like,
start over?

69
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,532
No. I get it. I get it.
I just thought...

70
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,799
You know, well,
you look older than you are.

71
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,431
You certainly act
older than you are.

72
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,412
Really?

73
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:30,346
Yeah. I was expecting someone
not as impressive.

74
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,648
Me too.

75
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,592
Cool shirt.

76
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,887
You want it?

77
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,393
No, I didn't really bring
enough bucks, so...

78
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,523
And yet, not actually
what I was asking.

79
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,930
Sure, I want it.

80
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,163
Can I get a green shirt
in a small, please?

81
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,704
No. No, no.

82
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,831
- I can't let you do that.
- What? Because...

83
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,466
- Because...
- What? Because you'd be so

84
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,306
indebted to me
that you'd have to...

85
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,643
Okay. I guess I can
let you do that.

86
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,477
You have to model it for me.

87
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,815
Conditions. I can't live
with all these conditions.

88
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,319
Thanks.

89
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,693
- This is so unfair.
- What?

90
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,353
This is when things happen,

91
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,955
in the middle of the night, by which time
I am completely out of the scene.

92
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,967
Life as a teenager.

93
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,505
I just hate having to depend
Lindsey to drive me everywhere.

94
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,073
You'll be driving
before you know it.

95
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,338
In the meantime, I missed
Elizabeth Wurtzel speaking at USC

96
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,935
and the Goldfrapp concert.

97
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,877
I was at the Goldfrapp concert actually.

98
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,313
Shut up. You were?
Was it great?

99
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,244
Of course it was great.
What am I saying?

100
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,380
Well, you could judge for yourself.

101
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,856
- I got a bootleg MP3.
- You have the concert?

102
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,428
Just one song. A little louder, please,
so the authorities know.

103
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,959
I totally have to hear it.

104
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,225
I'll send it to you.

105
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,632
After you get home,
after you get around to it.

106
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,629
Good things are worth the wait.

107
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,343
And what have you waited for recently?

108
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,809
I'm gonna have to wait
four years for you.

109
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,282
You are just trying to distract me
from that MP3.

110
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,907
Look, I have to send it.

111
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,418
It's not like I could
take you to my house.

112
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,078
That would be a little insane.

113
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,414
True.

114
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,984
Okay, now don't peek.

115
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,957
I shoot models for a living.

116
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,724
I've seen it all before.

117
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,662
And you're so sure about that?

118
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,961
I'm thinkin' yeah.

119
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,365
Maybe you should peek

120
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:34,303
and make that clerk wonder
what's going on over here.

121
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,302
In your dreams, little girl.

122
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,139
Little girl?

123
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,409
Whatever happened to
how mature I was?

124
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,615
- Is this mature enough for you?
- Okay...

125
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,856
Keep teasing me like that,
you're gonna drive me crazy.

126
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,754
Is that so?

127
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,622
Okay. All right.

128
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,023
How's this?

129
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,723
Nice.

130
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,092
Okay.

131
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,170
Now, there's three points
I have to make.

132
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:10,072
One: You wouldn't take advantage
because you've been seen with me.

133
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,940
And two: It's Goldfrapp.

134
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,206
And three?

135
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,544
Well, and three...

136
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,110
You said that it would be
insane for me to come over and...

137
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:26,954
Four... Four out of five doctors agree
that I am actually insane.

138
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,960
Thus, I have to come over

139
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,257
in order to be true to myself.

140
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,593
Right?

141
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,445
And the fourth reason:
This amazing car.

142
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,851
Well, in the face of logic like that,
I bow down and worship.

143
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,116
Bow down?

144
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,122
That's a good idea.
What are you waiting for?

145
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,388
Worship me.

146
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,529
Yes, oh, royal Thonggirl.

147
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,197
I am not worthy
to kiss your feet.

148
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,796
Maybe you are.

149
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,213
Maybe we should, like,
get going.

150
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,045
Yes, oh, magnificent thonggirl.

151
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,551
You wanna call your sister?
Tell her where you'll be?

152
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,094
Maybe later.
I just wanna get in this car.

153
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,717
Wow. So hot.

154
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,165
What's wrong?

155
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,430
Well, they teach us "young things"

156
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,903
not to drink anything
we haven't mixed ourselves, so...

157
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,598
Smart.

158
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,108
Come back in the kitchen.
I'll pour it again.

159
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,404
No. Come on.

160
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,640
I can whip up something
more entertaining than that.

161
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,118
Healthy dude, huh?

162
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,716
I try.

163
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,627
Figure I'll live
as long as I can.

164
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,764
Living long is overrated.

165
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,393
What? You don't want
to reach a ripe, old age?

166
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,368
For what?
When I'm 80,

167
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,443
what do I do for fun?

168
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,910
When you're 80 I'll be 98.

169
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,912
Right... and useless to me.

170
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,775
What use do you have
in mind for me?

171
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,632
I knew there'd be something
fun around here.

172
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,463
I mean, other than wa...

173
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,275
I bet these babes
got some dirt on you.

174
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,434
Those are models.

175
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:10,243
So why are they on your walls
instead of magazine covers?

176
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,977
Here, looking at you while

177
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:19,888
you know, you do the most
intimate things.

178
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,755
My house is my studio.

179
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,797
When clients come here they're walking
into my giant portfolio.

180
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,059
So, what?
These were all shot here?

181
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,801
Oh, my God.

182
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,570
Okay, you are like
a big deal, aren't you?

183
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,007
I get work.

184
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:44,276
Isn't that one of those cameras
that gives you the square image?

185
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,078
How do you know that?

186
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,952
I'm a goon.
I just, like, read constantly.

187
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,956
You saw all those books in my bag.

188
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,821
You're not reading now.

189
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,793
I'm not, am I?

190
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,625
Feels good.

191
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,803
Don't fall behind.

192
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,534
We should toast.

193
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,041
Carpe...

194
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,111
omnious.

195
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,910
What's that?

196
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,448
It's my own little toast.

197
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,011
You know carpe diem.

198
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,316
"Seize the day."

199
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,221
So I figure, carpe omnious.

200
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,850
"Take it all."

201
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,920
Take it all.

202
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:43,134
So, like, what is it like
to look through your lens at some...

203
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,870
beautiful woman
who's working so hard

204
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,343
to look good for you?

205
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,313
You know these models.
They all have handlers.

206
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,976
People to make sure
their hair is just right

207
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,484
and their makeup is okay

208
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,612
and they don't get lost
on their way to their next gig.

209
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,123
So you never get
to be alone with them?

210
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,785
- Rarely.
- Poor Jeff.

211
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,261
I am compensated for my troubles.
Don't worry about me.

212
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,491
But I like worrying about you.

213
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,737
It makes me wonder...

214
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,896
What?

215
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,873
No, no. Forget it.

216
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,501
No, come on.

217
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,375
Come on. What's in that
insane mind of yours?

218
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:33,186
Okay. We'll have another screwdriver
and then maybe I'll tell you.

219
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,193
- I'm waiting.
- Hold on.

220
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,891
You are not keeping up.

221
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:46,866
What?

222
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:51,375
Okay, here's where you're supposed
to make it easier for me and read my mind.

223
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,138
You're wondering how many
models I've done it with.

224
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,081
No.

225
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,286
- How many?
- None of them.

226
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,448
- Oh, get out.
- No. They're underage, mostly.

227
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,858
I'd be arrested.

228
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,727
So you're not arrested
for photographing them like this?

229
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,197
I'm very aware
of the legal boundaries.

230
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,268
- I have to be.
- Right. Right.

231
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,600
'Cause secretly...
Secretly...

232
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,765
you would like to do them.

233
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,333
No. There's just one
that I slept with

234
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,505
when we were both younger.

235
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,017
That one?

236
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,176
No out here.

237
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,188
- In the bedroom?
- No...

238
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,754
What's her name?

239
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,832
Hey.

240
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,833
"Janelle."

241
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,427
Yeah. Janelle.

242
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,101
So, what? What? Was she, like,
the first big girlfriend or something?

243
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,643
That's right.

244
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,109
Learned everything I knew
practicing on her.

245
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,910
And that date...

246
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,383
Was that the first time
that you guys...

247
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,452
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

248
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,628
So, what? Where is she now?

249
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,095
She actually signed with Ford
right after this shoot.

250
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,492
- She really took off. She, um...
- Oh, my God.

251
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,664
She is, like, on magazine covers.
I know her.

252
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,642
Well, like, not personally, obviously.

253
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,439
You are impressive
every second.

254
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,709
The models are impressive.
I just know how to bring it out.

255
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,514
You still love her.

256
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,746
No.

257
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,152
Ah... yeah.

258
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,223
- No.
- Yeah!

259
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,450
- No.
- Really?

260
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,923
- No.
- Really, really, really?

261
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:48,993
No.

262
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,826
I still love how simple things were
back then but...

263
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,263
You know, l...

264
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,262
I don't want to forget that, but...

265
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,804
we've moved on.

266
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,677
You're lonely.

267
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,443
No.

268
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,951
I can hear it in your voice.

269
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,520
I'm a big boy.

270
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,188
I guess everyone kind of
has a Janelle, right?

271
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,785
I guess.

272
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,689
Hey.

273
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,528
What if you got
one of your cameras

274
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,502
and we can see
what you can bring out in me.

275
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,834
- This is what you wanted to ask?
- Well, l...

276
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,340
- It's not as easy as you think.
- Okay.

277
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,637
Models don't just pout their lips.

278
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,077
They have to be willing
to open up.

279
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,809
They have to show us
a little of their soul,

280
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,044
their secrets.

281
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,416
And most people only open up
from weakness.

282
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,922
Nobody wants to see photos
of weak people.

283
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,755
We look at great models
because they open up...

284
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,761
from a position of...

285
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,153
of, uh, of strength.

286
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,199
They have the strength...

287
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,859
to believe they can do anything,

288
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,570
no matter how crazy, or, uh...

289
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,197
Are you okay?

290
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,039
- Let's try something.
- Okay.

291
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,719
Do me out here.

292
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,845
- I shoot everyone in my studio.
- Oh, come on.

293
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,925
But I'm not everyone, am I?

294
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,890
Clearly not.

295
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,623
Come on, Jeff. Shoot me.

296
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,597
Come on.

297
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,961
Shoot me.

298
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,302
- Don't do that.
- What?

299
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,875
That phony music video crap.

300
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,069
Come on.

301
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,779
Just be yourself.

302
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,609
Just be open.

303
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,983
- Weren't you just listening to me?
- Come on, Jeff.

304
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,886
- Sit down.
- Shoot me.

305
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,319
Look at me.

306
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,650
Be honest.

307
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,622
Would you listen to me?
Just sit down.

308
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,921
- Jeff, I don't...
- Sit down.

309
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,087
- J-Jeff, I don't...
- Sit down!

310
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,300
Are you okay?

311
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,734
I don't feel so good.

312
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,070
Did you... Did you call me?

313
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,875
Sorry. I was just looking through
your medicine cabinet.

314
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,575
Okay, boring!
No Valley of the Dolls stuff at all.

315
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,050
Can't help but wondering
why all the lubricants though.

316
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,819
Oh, hey, just...
Tell me when you're ready.

317
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,121
Take your time.

318
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,562
What did you...

319
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,798
- What di...
- You remember what I said

320
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:22,268
about not drinking anything
you didn't mix yourself?

321
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,633
That's good advice
for everyone.

322
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,112
You know what? I'm sorry
you were drugged for so long.

323
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,780
I've never really done that before
and I swiped this from my dad.

324
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,325
Didn't come with directions
and it's not like I could just ask him

325
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,691
how much to use.

326
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,387
So I probably used too much

327
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,295
or those screwdrivers could
have affected my judgment, you think?

328
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,869
It's real water.

329
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,672
Scout's honor.

330
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,316
Wha...

331
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,450
Why do I get... tied up first

332
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,128
if this is how we're gonna play?

333
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,399
Jeff...

334
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,399
play time is over.

335
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,739
Now it's time to wake up.

336
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,848
This isn't funny.

337
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,871
Is this some... teenage joke?

338
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,741
"Teenage."

339
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,441
Yes.

340
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,145
Joke?

341
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:14,986
No.

342
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,083
- Now let me...
- Patience.

343
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,284
- Let me go. Let me go!
- Patience.

344
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,520
- Let me go!
- Patience.

345
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,195
I'm just checking out
the side of the house, okay?

346
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,000
You know, I saw this cop show once.
It was great.

347
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,597
And the killer, he thought he had cleaned up
all the evidence

348
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,576
but some of the victim's blood
was on his shirt

349
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,237
and, yeah, sure,
he washed it,

350
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:47,011
but some of the dried up blood
got caught in the lint trap, so...

351
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,551
I mean...

352
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,250
Anything in here
I should know about?

353
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,589
What the fuck are you doing?

354
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,626
That's kind of been
my question, Jeff.

355
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,330
What the fuck are you doing,

356
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,459
living in a house filled with pictures

357
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,060
of half-naked teenage girls?

358
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,868
Oh, none of whom
you've ever done it with...

359
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,341
Help! Help!

360
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,105
Help! He...

361
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:26,221
There is really no point
in me taking any risks, Jeff.

362
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,691
Technically, I could let you scream
your fucking brains out

363
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,456
and no one is going to hear you.

364
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:36,022
Yeah, I waited till today
because Mr. Coughlin is at work,

365
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:40,070
and the Kraskows...
they're vacationing in Santa Barbara.

366
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,903
Still, I can't have some pedestrian
just happening by as you're screaming,

367
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,640
so shut up, or next time
it's gonna be bleach, okay?

368
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,516
You've been stalking me?

369
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,124
Okay.

370
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,220
All right. Let's get this straight.

371
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,462
You have been stalking me.

372
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,972
Yeah. I went into other chat rooms,
with different nicknames.

373
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,200
You would get to know
each woman...

374
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,139
and then as soon as you found out
they were any bit older than me

375
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,442
you would just drop them like that.

376
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,210
You took your time
sniffing out someone my age.

377
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,154
I didn't talk to the others
because they were boring.

378
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,090
- You and I connected.
- Oh, right.

379
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,529
Come on. You think
I faked all that?

380
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,497
You know, actually
it's kind of funny.

381
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:47,532
Because every time I would mention
some obscure singer or band

382
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,164
you knew so much about them.

383
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,836
But not right away.

384
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,935
It was, like, a few minutes later.

385
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,483
Maybe to give you enough time
to look them up on the web?

386
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,154
Jeff...

387
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,718
you used the same phrases
about Goldfrapp

388
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,227
as they do on Amazon. Com.

389
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,433
Busted.

390
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,438
By the way,

391
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:26,203
I fucking hate... Goldfrapp.

392
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:31,841
Come on.

393
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,681
I wanted to impress you.

394
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,446
I'm not the first guy to do something
stupid to impress a girl.

395
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,048
Does that deserve being
tied up and tortured?

396
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,955
Torture?

397
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,633
Is this torture to you?

398
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,930
I guess you've never read anything by
Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch

399
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,634
because this...

400
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,174
This is nothing.

401
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:42,184
Of course you're not
the first guy to lie to a girl, Jeff.

402
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,782
The operative word there
being "girl."

403
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,918
I mean, you know
how old I am.

404
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:53,487
What makes a kid who's barely past
her first period worth all this research?

405
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,366
I mean, you really got
to start to wonder

406
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,767
when a grown man
goes through all this trouble

407
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,463
just to charm a girl.

408
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,235
Wow. There's that word again.

409
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,468
"Girl."

410
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:11,447
You know, maybe it's
this whole camera thing?

411
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,785
Cameras... computers.

412
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,448
They let you hide, don't they?

413
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,854
So safe.

414
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:27,422
I heard how your voice changed
when the camera came between us.

415
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,262
My voice changed
because I felt sick

416
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,131
because you drugged me.

417
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,637
Yeah, you were drugged, all right.

418
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,101
And the drug was sweet

419
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:41,508
little 14-year-old flesh.

420
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,539
Look...

421
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,482
I'm a decent guy, ask anyone.

422
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,952
Go ahead. Call these models.
They'll tell you.

423
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,446
Of course they will.

424
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,687
You're not an idiot, Jeff.

425
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,195
You don't piss where you live.

426
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:03,700
Those girls were your work
and I, on the other hand was...

427
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,358
your play.

428
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,597
- You were coming on to me.
- Come on.

429
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,138
That's what they always say.

430
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,366
- Who?
- Who?

431
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,965
The pedophiles!

432
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,840
"She was so sexy.
She was asking for it."

433
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,143
"She was only technically a girl.
She acted like a woman."

434
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:22,151
It's just so easy
to blame a kid, isn't it?

435
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,757
Just because a girl
knows how to imitate a woman

436
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,386
does not mean she's ready to do
what a woman does.

437
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,494
I mean, you're the grown-up here.

438
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,100
If a kid is experimenting

439
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,866
and says something flirtatious,
you ignore it.

440
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,338
You don't encourage it.

441
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,674
If a kid says,
"Hey, let's make screwdrivers,"

442
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,942
you take the alcohol away
and you don't race them to the next drink!

443
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,243
Look, look.

444
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,113
I've been lonely, okay?

445
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,848
That makes me stupid
but I am not a pedophile.

446
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,254
- I am not lonely.
- This is some horrible mistake.

447
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,758
- And not stupid.
- Untie me. We'll forget this whole thing.

448
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,850
Just untie me now!

449
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,897
I might be a little peeved.
So when I am ready,

450
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:10,195
I'll call a cab and call another one
to let you loose.

451
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,099
- When will that be?
- I'm not sure yet.

452
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,282
Don't...

453
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,544
You can save yourself
so much time

454
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,711
by just dropping that word
from your vocabulary.

455
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,483
I'm gonna do
what I want, Jeff.

456
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:43,133
See, a guy as smooth
at seducing adolescents as you are

457
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,998
and takes those photographs...

458
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,603
I just figure he has something around
that he doesn't want seen,

459
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,040
and when I find that,

460
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,909
then maybe I'll know
what I'm dealing with.

461
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,106
What you're dealing with?

462
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,945
I mean, what kind
of pedophile are you?

463
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,018
Just a voyeur?

464
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,814
Again, not a pedophile.

465
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,913
Right. You're a photographer.

466
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,687
Takes a genius to get paid
for what you'd be happy to do for free.

467
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,557
Go into the living room.

468
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,188
Look in the grey cabinet.
Pull out the third drawer down.

469
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,429
You'll see prints of my work
for all kinds of environmental groups.

470
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,367
I've done shots of the Yukon Territory,

471
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,540
the Utah wilderness,

472
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,633
Inuit villages in Alaska...

473
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,414
So what?

474
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,882
You love nature, thus you must
be a nice guy?

475
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,352
I'm saying my modeling shots
are just part of my portfolio.

476
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,252
I've shot a lot of different subjects,

477
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,086
some of it very important work.

478
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,093
And it was so important
that you thought,

479
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:47,255
"Well, I can't possibly
hang it on the walls of my home.

480
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,856
I need to plaster my house
with pictures of underage nymphs

481
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,663
and just tuck the nature shots away."

482
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,670
So... a voyeur
and a conservationist.

483
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,804
I'm not a voyeur!

484
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,007
Not just a voyeur.

485
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,177
Sometimes you kick it up
a notch to molestation.

486
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,984
I am not a molester!
I've no idea who you've confused me with.

487
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,888
Sometimes you molest someone
and they fight back

488
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,019
and you completely lose
control and you hurt them.

489
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,892
I have never hurt anyone!

490
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,499
We'll just see, won't we?

491
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,577
Those letters are mine.

492
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:42,085
Nothing's yours when you invite
a teenager into your home.

493
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,821
Don't love her anymore, huh?

494
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,921
That explains why you save these.

495
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,864
I thought about selling them
on e-Bay.

496
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,535
Excuse me?

497
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:04,708
Sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Maybe it was the music or...

498
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,300
I don't know.
Maybe it was the bullshit.

499
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,743
All right. Honestly...

500
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,714
Some day I thought about
sending them to her,

501
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,684
reminding her how much
of a bitch she was.

502
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,117
A little angry, are we?

503
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,953
She broke your heart
and you haven't gotten over it?

504
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,029
You walk into somebody's house,
you start looking through their shit...

505
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,597
You're gonna find things
that embarrasses them.

506
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,188
It doesn't mean anything.

507
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,859
All right. Okay.

508
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,499
"Dear Jeff.

509
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,546
You have to stop.
I can't go where you wanna take me.

510
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,116
You're just not the person
I thought you were."

511
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,845
You don't have to read it.
I know what it says.

512
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,251
I bet you do. How many times
did you read this?

513
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,448
None of your business.

514
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,186
What kind of person
did she find out you were, Jeff?

515
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,625
None of your business.

516
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,356
That kind of depends
on how you define business, actually.

517
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,797
So, what? Did you find her?

518
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:08,235
The girl you wanted? Is this what
your work is, some big search?

519
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,256
Are you the type of guy
who likes to save his outgoing e-mails?

520
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:36,390
Read them over and over again,
to think about what you said?

521
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,505
This is weird.

522
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,304
Your download manager says
you pulled some photos off the net,

523
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:51,780
but... I can't find them.

524
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,646
Gosh, that's strange.

525
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,611
Yeah. A smart guy
doesn't leave photos on his computer.

526
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,785
'Cause that's the first place
the cops are gonna look.

527
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,660
And then you're... into mementos.

528
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:12,225
So where do you put the stuff
that you pull off the net, hm?

529
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,865
Do you have a special
little hiding place or something?

530
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,241
I live alone.

531
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,040
Why would I need
a hiding place?

532
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:25,912
Just what I've been wondering.

533
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,350
I have looked through
your whole house.

534
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,080
Everything...

535
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,317
and I have found no porn.

536
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,054
I have not found
a single bit...

537
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,357
of porn.

538
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,989
Guys tend to have porn around
don't they?

539
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,658
Nothing against it,
nothing against them.

540
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,766
It's just the way they're brought up.

541
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,931
Seriously, if a guy knows
he can get away with it,

542
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,204
all guys, they have porn
at least somewhere in their crib.

543
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:57,270
- You've done studies on this of course.
- Then I was thinking...

544
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,350
that these photos on his wall,
maybe those are his porn.

545
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,115
But I bet they're not your stroke shots.

546
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,556
I bet whatever you have is so...

547
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,217
juicy,

548
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,161
it needs its own little cubbyhole.

549
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,424
Isn't that right, Jeff?

550
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,999
So what's the combination, Jeff?

551
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,663
Eat me.

552
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,638
Look at how he's sweating.

553
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,801
Does this worry you, Jeff?

554
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,347
I'm gonna figure it out,
so you might as well just tell me.

555
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,808
I am an honor student.

556
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,044
Take your time.

557
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,049
Oh, I will.

558
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,250
- Believe me, I've got plenty.
- No, not much.

559
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,592
Aren't mommy and daddy gonna worry
if you're not home before dinner?

560
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,688
I'm thinking no.

561
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,826
Oh, is that it?

562
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,404
What? They're too busy
to keep track of you,

563
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:38,305
so you reach out to somebody
who seems like he might care about you?

564
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,502
And you're so mad
because they ignore you?

565
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,803
They've always made the fuss
over your older sister

566
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,745
because she learned
to do everything first?

567
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,546
You're furious with them,

568
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,643
but they do love you

569
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,223
and they pay for your existence,

570
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,758
but you can't let them see
any of that anger.

571
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,129
- I'm not angry at them.
- No, no. Absolutely not.

572
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,864
That'd be too dangerous.

573
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,301
But you are angry,

574
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,103
and you gotta
let it out somehow.

575
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:16,145
So you find a guy...
an older guy...

576
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,383
Maybe he reminds you
a little of your dad.

577
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,551
Let me guess.
I look like him?

578
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,386
You don't look
anything like him.

579
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,186
If you say so.

580
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,862
But you gotta
let that anger out somehow.

581
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,932
- And I seem like a good target...
- Will you shut up?

582
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,830
Seriously, just shut up!

583
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,062
You know nothing about me.

584
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,698
No, you're right.
So sit down and tell me.

585
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,173
We'll talk.

586
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,374
- Yeah, right.
- We can sit on the sofa.

587
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,948
And I'll call a taxi for you.

588
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,744
If you want, I'll hold you.

589
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,786
If you don't want,
I'll keep my distance.

590
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:02,219
You can let it all out.
If you need to cry, if you need to scream.

591
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,226
Whatever you need, Hayley.

592
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,298
You wouldn't be mad at me?

593
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,136
I just want you
to look at what you're doing.

594
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,476
I just wanna ask, um...

595
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,324
Did you... Did you seriously think
that that was gonna work?

596
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,964
You're good at what you do, Jeff.

597
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,769
What you do is work
with teenage girls, put them at ease

598
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,276
so they can trust you
with all their secrets.

599
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,846
No, that's not what I was doing.

600
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,280
Janelle's birthday.

601
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,200
Janelle's phone number.

602
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,142
Janelle's phone number backwards.

603
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,079
You're an honor student.

604
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,776
Try every possible combination
of numbers.

605
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,080
Should only take you
the rest of the week,

606
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,280
if you figure in breaks for meals.

607
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,222
Or l...

608
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:48,730
Or I could just try
March 19th.

609
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,369
March 19th. First with Janelle.

610
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:01,608
What's this, Jeff?
You are lensman319 after all.

611
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,011
Was this the first photo session
or the first time you banged her?

612
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,106
Or was that the same thing?

613
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,788
Hm. What year would that have been?

614
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,316
3-19-87?

615
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,261
Nope.

616
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,130
3-19-89?

617
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,073
How sentimental you are.

618
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,384
What's so special
about these photos?

619
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:04,005
This is what they make
those federal laws for, Jeff.

620
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,840
This is officially sick.

621
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,919
What makes this girl
so special?

622
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,322
Why does she get
to keep her clothes on?

623
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,310
I recognize this girl.

624
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,023
Hayley?

625
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,238
Where are you?

626
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,899
Oh, fuck!

627
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,030
Welcome back.

628
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,970
I'm sorry to expose you like this.

629
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,876
It's not about sex,
although I have to admit...

630
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,207
you are built.

631
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,378
I never touched you.

632
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,253
I was trying
to hold you off me

633
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,554
while I called the cops.

634
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,288
Would you have shown them this?

635
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:52,000
Why do you have a picture
of Donna Mauer in your safe?

636
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:55,094
And have you seen her,
because no one else has.

637
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,272
I did meet Donna for coffee.

638
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,909
I took a shot of her
to make her happy.

639
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,189
So how happy did you make her?

640
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,089
Look at her.
She's fully dressed.

641
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:20,061
You can see the coffee shop
behind her.

642
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,460
I never brought her home.

643
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,697
So, what?
You just said,

644
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,396
"See you later, kid.
It's been fun."

645
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,231
You could have thrown this away.

646
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,134
You didn't.

647
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,304
You needed to hang on to it.

648
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,047
You could have talked
to the police.

649
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,743
- You're right.
- Yeah.

650
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,287
Or maybe you had something to hide,

651
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,017
like the extensive kiddy porn collect...

652
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,253
Look. I'm not the monster
you think I am.

653
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,928
But okay, I... crossed a line.

654
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:00,201
Just call the cops.
I'll turn myself in.

655
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,906
A cute pedophile pleads guilty.

656
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,807
"But, oh, it's not his fault.

657
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,436
He's sick.
He has an addiction."

658
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,674
I'll do jail. Isn't that
what should happen?

659
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,808
Yeah, you might.
You might get jail time.

660
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,183
I don't know...
Therapy, drugs,

661
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,223
group discussions, notifying people
when you move into a new house.

662
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:24,317
- How bad is that, really?
- It'll ruin my career, my life.

663
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,896
Didn't Roman Polanski
just win an Oscar?

664
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,027
So why the ice?

665
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:44,913
I read the psych profile
about the person who took Donna Mauer.

666
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,949
Said he's a loner.

667
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,646
Thinks he's pretty damn bright
and as powerful as a teenage girl.

668
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:54,519
He's gonna strike again.
Kind of sounds a lot like you.

669
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,556
It's not me!

670
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,388
Maybe not, but...

671
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,890
Those photos that I found

672
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,092
and the way you let me get drunk...

673
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,738
You're a headline
waiting to happen.

674
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:19,739
Everybody will be safer
if I do a little preventive maintenance.

675
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,391
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I have to shave you down here.

676
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,826
I can't have any hair
on the incision site, right?

677
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,521
What?

678
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,225
I've been going in my dad's
medical library at school

679
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:41,964
and, um, well, you said
I was pretty bright, right?

680
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:45,473
I think I'm smart enough
to perform a successful castration.

681
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:46,701
No!

682
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,971
- Please.
- No! Ow!

683
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,639
Okay, okay.
I guess you're not numb enough yet.

684
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,780
What should we talk about
while we're waiting?

685
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,752
"Dear Janelle.
My name is Hayley Stark.

686
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,291
I hope you don't mind me
writing you like this.

687
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,988
I met this guy
that I think you know... Jeff Kohlver.

688
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,894
He's so cute.

689
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:11,866
Well, he seems to really like me.

690
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,664
He even asked me over
to his place to do some photography,

691
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,966
and I am so excited about this

692
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,634
because, well,
for a 14 year old like me,

693
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,973
this could be a huge break,
you know?"

694
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:28,650
And here I put in a little smiley face icon.

695
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,285
"Thing is,

696
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:35,188
and I've tried to pretend this isn't the case,
but he talks about you a lot,

697
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,420
and I have this ooky feeling
he's still in love with you.

698
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,958
I'm pretty sweet on him too,

699
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:44,056
but I don't want to go crazy
over him if there's some chance

700
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,658
that you two
might get back together.

701
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,465
So, so, so, so,

702
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,563
I found your e-mail address
in his PDA,

703
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,904
and I thought I'd just ask.

704
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,008
Is this insane?

705
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,145
Am I insane?

706
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,841
Is Jeff?

707
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,185
And this other girl
he talks about all the time.

708
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,316
Her name is... Donna Mauer.

709
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:14,359
Do you know anything about her?

710
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:19,732
I found these photos on his computer but,
silly me, I can't figure out how to open them,

711
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,531
but I'm attaching them to this note.

712
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,096
Are they pictures of you or Donna?

713
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,842
Anyhoo, thanks a mil.

714
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:31,175
Your complete honesty
will be "mucho" appreciated.

715
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:34,375
Love and peace, Hayley."

716
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,757
I tried to make it sound as innocent
and moronic as possible.

717
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,587
How do you think I did?

718
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,598
Fine.

719
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,429
Guess I'll just send it
and that'll be that.

720
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:57,067
You're getting yourself
in terrible trouble.

721
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,540
Oh, and how's that?

722
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,207
If you cut me in any way,
you won't forget it.

723
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,181
It changes you when
you hurt somebody.

724
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,445
And you speak from experience,
I guess.

725
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,180
I've just lived.

726
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,688
Unlike you.

727
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,622
The things you do wrong...

728
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,324
They haunt you.

729
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,724
Tell me what you're haunted by.

730
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:29,537
You wanna remember this day
when you're with a guy on a date?

731
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,231
Or on your wedding night?

732
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,206
'Cause I promise you,
you will.

733
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,802
Don't do that to yourself.

734
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,380
Wow.

735
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,679
You know, that is so thoughtful.

736
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,915
You are speaking to me
so selflessly.

737
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:50,720
I mean, you just don't want me
to castrate you for my own benefit?

738
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,023
Wow, I'm touched.

739
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,590
Jeff.

740
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,602
Why don't we imagine
someone saying the same thing to you

741
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,865
at a random moment?

742
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:08,500
Lmagine that, when you
downloaded this little girl...

743
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:15,281
I was sitting by your side saying,
"Stop. Don't do that to yourself."

744
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,417
Would you have listened?

745
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,293
Stop.

746
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,592
Don't do that to yourself.

747
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,768
Stop.

748
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,464
Don't do that to yourself.

749
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,978
Stop.

750
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,315
Stop.

751
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,969
You are good and numb, aren't you?

752
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,663
Fuck off.

753
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:13,732
Your conversational skills
are really deteriorating as the day goes on.

754
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:20,274
Seriously. It turns out that castration
is the easiest surgical procedure around,

755
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:24,046
and thousands of farm boys across
the country guild their own livestock.

756
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:28,989
So I figure, if they can do it, then I can
pull it off, if you know what I mean.

757
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,458
I'm not fucking livestock.

758
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,358
You keep telling yourself that, stud.

759
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,192
Help!

760
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,789
Help!

761
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,430
Look, that wasn't necessary.

762
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:43,998
You bitch.

763
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,802
No more wiggling.

764
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:57,646
Does your mother know
you cut off men's balls?

765
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:01,053
I've never done it before today, but...

766
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,958
Maybe I'll tell her
when I get home,

767
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,996
see what she says.

768
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,802
"Hayley, I knew you needed
a science fair project, but really..."

769
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,995
So you and your mom
are both whacked.

770
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:20,970
I don't know. That's that whole
nature versus nurture question, isn't it?

771
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:27,676
Was I born a cute, vindictive
little bitch or...

772
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:32,448
did society make me that way?

773
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,318
I go back and forth on that.

774
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:38,558
I'll be done in a sec.
I'm almost done.

775
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,597
There's money in the safe.

776
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,928
- So?
- So you could take it.

777
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,661
Take the camera equipment.
Take whatever you want!

778
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:47,702
I am.

779
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:52,036
You really can't talk me
out of this by bribing me, okay?

780
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,670
How... How can I?

781
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,247
What? Talk me out of it?

782
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,407
I don't know.
I haven't thought about that.

783
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:10,448
You know what? I need
to sterilize this before we start.

784
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,427
Do you want me to use
the vodka,

785
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,124
or do you have
another alcohol you wanna offer me?

786
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,267
Okay.

787
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,439
Okay, all that scraping I did...

788
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:34,643
The blood probably rushed back in.
I have to numb you out a bit more, okay?

789
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,284
I'll be right back.

790
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,748
Can I call someone for you?
Is that what you...

791
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,344
Oh, you're getting bored.

792
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,912
Look, I'm sorry.
We gotta get this show on the road.

793
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:28,060
Oh, it's actually really impressive.

794
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,224
I thought it would be fun
to see how far you could get,

795
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,735
and I really only expected,
like, an inch or two.

796
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,239
That's not bad.

797
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,968
Why don't you just kill me?

798
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,715
Is that what you think I want?

799
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:52,944
Isn't it?

800
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,489
Close.

801
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,908
I love that you have all this stuff

802
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,578
because, like, this way you can watch,
you know?

803
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,849
Now I'm hurt.

804
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,552
I go through all the trouble
to set this up and you don't want to watch?

805
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,095
I just...

806
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:43,434
I stayed one summer with my
Aunt Denise and her kids.

807
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:47,103
You know, and her kids
were, like four or five,

808
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,939
and I was, like, ten.

809
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,342
No. No, I was nine.

810
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:56,015
And the littlest one...
the daughter, Lynnie...

811
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,317
She... she loved me.

812
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:02,653
So she had this...
she had this game

813
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:07,162
where she would jump out
of the bathtub, all soaking wet...

814
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,428
and she'd jump on top of me

815
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:11,557
and she'd tickle me.

816
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,130
And she'd tickle me
and she'd shout:

817
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,001
"Prune attack!
Prune attack!"

818
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,040
'Cause her fingers
were all pruney.

819
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:25,669
I-I-I couldn't do anything
'cause I was afraid I'd hurt her

820
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:29,183
and it was weird.

821
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:35,481
And one day her mother
came in, in the middle of it...

822
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,453
and she saw her daughter,
naked on top of me.

823
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:47,668
And then... she yelled at her:

824
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:52,500
"Lynnie, get back in the bathtub."

825
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,209
Then she took me by the hand...

826
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,312
and she dragged me
to the kitchen.

827
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,378
She turned the stove on.

828
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,317
We stood there
while the burner got hot.

829
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,788
And she pulled my pants down...

830
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:20,128
and lifted me up
over the burner.

831
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:28,870
I could feel the dirt
on my skin from her hands.

832
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,471
She must have been gardening.

833
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,914
And I cried and cried.

834
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:44,688
And I could hear the tears sizzle
as they hit the burner.

835
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,790
Then she sat me down.

836
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:56,635
She said, "If I ever catch you
with my daughter again..."

837
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,503
She called my mom.

838
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,741
My mom came the next day.

839
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,418
I never saw Aunt Denise again.

840
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:24,160
These things really stick.

841
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,496
Okay, well, you know, we're set.

842
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:31,340
Don't.

843
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,968
I told you not to use that word.

844
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,311
Okay?

845
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,243
Hayley, please.

846
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,212
You need help.

847
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,711
A teenage girl
doesn't do this.

848
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,687
I've seen your idea of what
a teenage girl should do,

849
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:47,915
so don't even start.

850
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,889
I'll pay for a therapist.

851
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,462
Thanks.

852
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,827
Thanks, but if I ever see a shrink...

853
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,763
- I want to make my case...
- Please.

854
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,698
Really, really interesting for them.

855
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,963
Please. I'll do whatever you want.

856
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:05,006
You could call the cops.
I'll say I did whatever you want.

857
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,042
I don't think they're gonna believe
a confession under these circumstances.

858
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:11,375
Then I'll leave.
I'll leave, okay? I'll move.

859
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,072
Mm-hmm.

860
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,650
Donna's body will still be
where you left it.

861
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,275
I'm not the guy!

862
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,752
I'm not the guy, I swear!

863
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,292
Anything! Please!

864
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,020
Please don't do this!

865
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,426
- Anything?
- Anything! Piss on me!

866
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,759
Fucking feed me glass!
I don't care! Whatever you want!

867
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,570
I'll tell the cops I did
whatever you want. Please!

868
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,368
I don't what ever you want.
Anything. Please.

869
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:41,443
Please. Anything.

870
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,239
Anything. Anything.

871
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:48,572
Please.

872
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,914
- Anything.
- Yes.

873
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,851
Yeah, anything.

874
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,786
Oh, please.

875
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:55,983
Please!

876
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:16,435
When I talked about sending an email
to Janelle, you changed the subject.

877
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,311
I could send it right now,
pack up and go.

878
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,978
It could be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

879
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:29,854
You could stop torturing yourself with the idea
that you might get back with her.

880
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:34,552
- What do you say?
- Goddamn it! Get the fuck off of me!

881
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:36,928
Please untie me and let me go!

882
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,797
Please! Please don't cut me!

883
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,928
Please! Please!

884
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,836
Please!

885
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,027
I shouldn't have teased you like that.

886
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:22,338
I shouldn't have let you think
there was a way out of this.

887
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,515
Hey, um...

888
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:35,021
I got this medical text,

889
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:37,217
and if I forget anything
just don't panic.

890
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,625
Okay, 'cause it's...
It's right here.

891
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,832
Yeah, I knew you'd want to watch.

892
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:50,064
Look, if you move too much,
I could...

893
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,800
knick the perineal artery
and you...

894
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:56,071
You could, like, bleed to death
before anyone got here, okay?

895
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,113
So, just, please.
I really need to have

896
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,877
a steady, steady hand, okay?

897
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,217
Jeff?

898
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:20,091
Do you feel that?

899
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,901
Why do you care?

900
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,035
I'd be thankful
for small favors.

901
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:50,690
Wow.

902
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,093
That went well.

903
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,510
You know, you told that, uh...

904
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:10,881
that Aunt Denise story very well.

905
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:12,317
Very, very well.

906
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:17,289
What was that supposed to be?
Some kind of magic key

907
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:20,487
to explain why you are
the way you are?

908
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,424
Doesn't.

909
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:29,270
Okay. What should I do first?
Your right or left testicle?

910
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:37,604
Why don't we just say right, okay?

911
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:41,342
All right, now, I just have to give it
one little slice to free it up,

912
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,883
and then, um...

913
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,382
Snip.

914
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,289
Okay. Now I just need
to suture it up.

915
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:54,692
This would be so much easier
if I had, like, a nurse or something,

916
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:58,494
but, you know, I asked my friend
if she'd help me castrate a guy

917
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,365
and, well, she made all these,
like, ooky sounds,

918
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,928
like I was asking her
to swallow worms or something.

919
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,703
Yeah, we'll see who makes medical school
in eight years, huh?

920
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,542
All right, now, you're gonna
feel a tug,

921
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,742
'cause I really gotta get this tight,
all right?

922
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:19,150
So just... bear with me.

923
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,686
Okay...

924
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,422
Okay.

925
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,825
Okay, halfway through.
Over the hump.

926
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,162
Can't you stop?

927
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,496
Please?

928
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,570
Some men,

929
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,697
they go through their whole lives
with only one ball,

930
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,040
and they're just fine, you know?

931
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:43,372
Or so I've read.

932
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:48,439
Well, I guess I figured that you're not really
punished if I leave you with a spare.

933
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,082
Okay, stay with me.
Stay with me.

934
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,025
It's okay.
It's okay, Jeff.

935
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:07,534
If-if I left one, then you'd
be walking around crooked all the time.

936
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,935
Look, this is for the best, all right?

937
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,508
Okay, you're entering
a whole new world now.

938
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:14,803
Just gotta...

939
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,911
snip and...

940
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:23,418
Okay.

941
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,577
Wow.

942
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,017
This seriously has to be, like,

943
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,186
one of the easiest
operations, because...

944
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,288
Wow.

945
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:41,764
I wonder why they teach Girl Scouts
things like camping

946
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,701
and selling cookies.

947
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,776
You know? 'Cause this is
what's really useful.

948
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,842
I don't know how they'd design
a merit badge though.

949
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,244
That'd be interesting.

950
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:57,379
I saw Lynnie at Aunt Denise's funeral.

951
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,954
I told her what her mom did.

952
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,148
She didn't believe me.

953
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,520
If Denise was here right now,
what would you say?

954
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,856
I'd say, "Help.

955
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:16,037
A teenager cut my balls off.
Call the police."

956
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:21,875
She wasn't very sympathetic
the last time,

957
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,104
so I wouldn't really hold your breath.

958
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,557
All right.

959
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,156
I would cancel any appointments
you have in the next few days

960
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:48,668
because you're going to be sorer
than you've ever been before.

961
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,536
Oh, I'd say, in, like,

962
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,471
eight or nine days,
take the stitches out,

963
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:56,009
which I suggest you do yourself

964
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,136
to save embarrassment.

965
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:01,512
Oh, and there's this website:
EunuchsQuestions. Com.

966
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:04,643
Eunuchs is e-u-n-u-c-h-s.

967
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:07,881
I had a lot of trouble with that
but it gives great advice

968
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,117
on how to deal with your castration.

969
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:13,388
You really... You don't have
to go through this alone, you know?

970
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:17,925
Do you want some souvenirs?

971
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:21,426
No?

972
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,665
Okay.

973
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,572
What should we do with them?

974
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,277
We could see how far they bounce.

975
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,951
Actually...

976
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:45,856
we wouldn't want, like,
a little animal

977
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:49,362
confusing it for
an afternoon snack.

978
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,797
You know?
A little squirrelly

979
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,800
or a coyote might get sick.

980
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:57,167
We don't want that, especially with
you being such a conservationist.

981
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:03,840
We could grind them up
in the garbage disposal.

982
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:08,840
Or... or we could sew them
back in.

983
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,782
I had this shop teacher once,

984
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,650
who sawed off his thumb in class,

985
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,587
and then he grabbed some ice,

986
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,158
drove to the emergency room.

987
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:20,160
The next day, sure enough,
he has his thumb.

988
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:24,164
Didn't bend so well, but he could,
like, hitchhike and stuff.

989
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:31,501
I'm just checking to see if it works.

990
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,923
I guess they, uh, weren't brass.

991
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,798
You're not laughing, are you?

992
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:05,662
Well, no wonder. This isn't
a laughing matter at all.

993
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:09,540
I don't know.
Maybe Donna's smiling just a tad.

994
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,070
I didn't do anything to her.

995
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,975
Maybe, maybe not.

996
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:22,246
But I suggest you track down
the guy who did...

997
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:25,986
'cause he has no idea
what's waiting for him.

998
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,061
Here.

999
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:28,789
You really need to rehydrate.

1000
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,062
Jeff. Please.
Come on.

1001
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:40,831
Jeff, I'm serious.

1002
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,436
You really, really need
to drink this, okay?

1003
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:48,106
Come on.

1004
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:52,848
Attaboy.

1005
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,684
Do you want more?

1006
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,522
Why are you being
so nice to me now?

1007
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,491
You're pitiful now, aren't you?

1008
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:12,298
I mean, it's going to be tricky,
not letting anyone find out about...

1009
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,274
No more sex.

1010
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:19,279
No more taking public showers.

1011
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,979
But one of these days
you're going to get a physical,

1012
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:24,916
and your doctor's going to find out.

1013
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:28,553
And don't worry.
He's not gonna tell his golf buddies...

1014
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,621
and they're not gonna tell their friends,

1015
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,922
and they're not gonna tell
their friends.

1016
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,393
But a couple years down the road
you're going to start wondering,

1017
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,229
"Do your publishers know?"

1018
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,193
"Do your models know?"

1019
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,970
"Does Janelle know?"

1020
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,039
God, I'm sweating.

1021
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:58,052
Look, I'll go take a shower

1022
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,781
and then I'll be out of your life, okay?

1023
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,413
I'll find you.

1024
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,551
Don't make threats
while you're still tied down.

1025
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,688
- I'm just saying...
- What do you expect me to do about it?

1026
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:11,356
I'm just saying.

1027
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:16,069
The easiest thing for me to do

1028
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:18,605
would be to just kill you.

1029
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,243
But I already told you
I'm not going to do that.

1030
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,877
You don't get off that easy, Jeff.

1031
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,753
I'm sweating like a pig.
Seriously.

1032
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:39,656
Um... I gotta go have a shower,

1033
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:44,255
and then when I come back later,
maybe we can chat some more.

1034
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,616
I'm all here.

1035
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,880
I'm all here.

1036
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:34,072
Why you can see it
with your very own eyes.

1037
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:37,373
Come on. Come on.

1038
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,627
Fuck.

1039
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,425
Hey, Trace.

1040
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,732
Look, I'm gonna be done, like,
so much sooner than I thought,

1041
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:19,329
so do you wanna
catch a movie or something?

1042
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,533
Cool.

1043
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,244
No, I'm not telling you.

1044
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:45,897
Yes, this is Lieutenant Hayley, L.A.P.D.

1045
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:49,198
You're acquainted with a photographer,
one Jeffrey Kohlver?

1046
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,670
Yes, there's been
an incident here.

1047
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:56,039
Is it possible that
you can assist us?

1048
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:01,110
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that at this moment, ma'am,

1049
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:05,380
but it's a very delicate matter and the sooner
we can speak with you here,

1050
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:09,253
the better chance we have
of keeping it out of the newspapers.

1051
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,624
We appreciate that.

1052
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,160
The address...

1053
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,795
Yes.

1054
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,925
Yes, that's the place.

1055
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,334
How soon do you think
we can be here?

1056
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:10,211
Steady.

1057
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:13,344
Stand straight.

1058
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:14,922
Attaboy.

1059
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:33,499
- You're insane.
- Right.

1060
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,645
Which I did tell you
when we first met, remember?

1061
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:41,171
"Four out of five doctors agree..."

1062
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:46,346
Maybe I should ask my therapist.

1063
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:48,581
See what she thinks
about it.

1064
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,318
Ask her much it would cost
to get a padded cell...

1065
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:55,823
Help!

1066
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,700
Shut up.

1067
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:03,293
Hi.

1068
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:06,404
Oh, hello.
Is Mr. Kohlver here?

1069
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:09,102
Um, he's asleep.
Not feeling so well.

1070
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,075
I think it's food poisoning.

1071
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:12,908
I'm sorry to hear that.

1072
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:14,345
Are you...

1073
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,781
I'm his niece.

1074
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,512
Oh, really?

1075
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:21,988
Can I ask you something?

1076
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,017
Okay.

1077
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:26,958
I might be a little
out of line here.

1078
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,527
Do you babysit?

1079
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,460
Yeah, yeah.
I do. I do.

1080
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:37,561
But I'm only here
for, like, a couple more days.

1081
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:38,832
That's too bad.

1082
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,408
I'm on a constant patrol
for new babysitters.

1083
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:42,874
Right.

1084
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,138
Are those...

1085
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,874
Yes. Mr. Kohlver's cookies.

1086
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:51,418
My daughter's a Girl Scout
and we've been trying to deliver these,

1087
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:55,216
but we've always been missing him,
so here they are, yummy stuff.

1088
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,347
Thanks.

1089
01:24:57,459 --> 01:25:00,485
Yeah. Uncle Jeff loves
his Girl Scouts, so...

1090
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,965
- You should probably...
- What?

1091
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:08,094
Well, pay me.

1092
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:10,398
Right. Yeah. I'm sorry.
How much is it?

1093
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,132
- Six.
- Six.

1094
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,402
Can you just wait here
for a second?

1095
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,572
No problem. Sure.

1096
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,290
Here you go.

1097
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:38,729
Did I hear something?

1098
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:44,627
The food poisoning.
He's... vomiting and...

1099
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,001
I'm so sorry.

1100
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,302
- Your cookies.
- Thanks.

1101
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:51,276
And if you're going to be around
any longer,

1102
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,847
I'm just... I'm three
houses down, across.

1103
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:56,644
I can always, always, always
use a new sitter.

1104
01:25:57,519 --> 01:26:00,079
- I wish I could, but...
- Yeah, me too.

1105
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:01,416
Well...

1106
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,354
So how's the roof?

1107
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,256
Sorry?

1108
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:08,989
You were on the roof.

1109
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:12,525
I was.

1110
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:15,933
Just a little while ago I was
trimming my roses and looked up

1111
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:19,871
and I saw you there
and I was wondering who it was.

1112
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,270
Ah, yeah, we...
There's, uh...

1113
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,676
We had a leak
and I...

1114
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,407
thought I'd go up and check.

1115
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,983
Your uncle made you
go up on the roof?

1116
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,384
Well...

1117
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:34,387
he's sick

1118
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,617
and I said I'd go and see
if there's, like...

1119
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:39,590
- A hole or...
- Right.

1120
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:42,629
Did it rain?

1121
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,902
I have to go back to my uncle.

1122
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:52,836
Oh, sure. No problem.

1123
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:55,501
Just tell him Judy Tokuda
said hello.

1124
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,872
- You bet.
- Okay?

1125
01:26:56,978 --> 01:26:58,138
Thanks.

1126
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:05,817
Well... it's "yummy stuff."

1127
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,822
A leak? That's all you
could come up with? Pathetic.

1128
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:14,426
Don't piss me off right now, Uncle Jeff.

1129
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:20,160
You know, she'll be back.

1130
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:21,860
She thinks you're flakey.

1131
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:24,768
You might need help...
putting it fucking mildly.

1132
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,362
When you got loose...

1133
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:31,003
did you call the police, did you run for help,
like an innocent person would?

1134
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:33,171
- I did call.
- Oh, yeah?

1135
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:37,912
Why don't we just
press redial and see?

1136
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,485
Face it, Jeff.

1137
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,685
You could have gotten away
and you didn't.

1138
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:50,392
Now it's so easy.

1139
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,468
I leave you here,

1140
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:57,270
someone will find you...

1141
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:00,807
along with the photo of Donna

1142
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:04,241
and the confession that
I typed on your computer.

1143
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,975
Or...

1144
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:10,676
I have a special time,
limited offer.

1145
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,181
You step off that chair,
you end it all,

1146
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,416
I destroy all the evidence.

1147
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:20,016
No one will ever know
why you killed yourself,

1148
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,891
not even Janelle.

1149
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:24,260
I didn't kill Donna Mauer.

1150
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:26,765
- We've been over this.
- Fuck you. I'm not gonna beg.

1151
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,859
You mean you're not going
to beg again?

1152
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,938
Because you do it so well.

1153
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:32,438
Please.

1154
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:37,904
Please, pretty please,
with a cherry on top.

1155
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:41,675
One that you just had to pop.

1156
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:47,179
You'll leave a clue.

1157
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:49,415
You've messed up
once already,

1158
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:51,014
more than once.

1159
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,389
Mrs. Tokuda's made you.

1160
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,758
She's figured you out.

1161
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:58,297
They'll find you.

1162
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,959
- They might.
- No. They will.

1163
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:04,402
You'll spend the rest of your life
lookin' over your shoulder.

1164
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:07,702
Waking up, in the middle
of the night,

1165
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:09,538
jumping at every noise.

1166
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:17,473
How hard do you think
they're going to look for me, really?

1167
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:21,479
I mean, they find a pedophile killer,
all gift wrapped for them.

1168
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:24,217
Do you think they're going
to care who did the work?

1169
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:26,316
Do you think they're even
gonna bring it up?

1170
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:30,887
And I will have the biggest
legal defense you ever saw.

1171
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:34,661
If everyone who's ever molested
sends me $5,

1172
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,703
oh, come on, I'll be able
to afford

1173
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,931
the best fucking lawyer in the world.

1174
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:42,305
Worst case scenario:

1175
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,810
Two years of community service?

1176
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:49,847
Jody Foster directs
the movie version of the whole thing.

1177
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,083
Who do you want to play you?

1178
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:54,245
You didn't leave, did ya?

1179
01:30:54,348 --> 01:30:55,838
No.

1180
01:30:57,552 --> 01:31:01,511
You don't wanna
leave me... do ya?

1181
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,095
Where are ya?

1182
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:18,300
We've spent too much time
only to walk away.

1183
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:22,403
I know you're not gonna leave.

1184
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:24,875
Come on!

1185
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:27,809
I'll make it good for you,
I promise!

1186
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,423
Oh, you're good.

1187
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,760
You're so good.
You're so fucking good!

1188
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:21,596
You're just like her!
You're all just fucking like her!

1189
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:23,932
You wanna drive a man
fucking crazy,

1190
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,529
then go ahead,
until you go out of your fucking mind!

1191
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:29,610
Then go... Go on
your fucking way!

1192
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,838
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1193
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:34,380
Go!

1194
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:40,880
You're right.

1195
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:42,717
You're right, Hayley.

1196
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:45,383
Thank you. Thank you.

1197
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,721
This is me.

1198
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:50,422
This is who I am.

1199
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:51,862
Thank you.

1200
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:53,695
Thank you for
helping me see it.

1201
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:46,585
What took you so long?

1202
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:49,212
- You dropped this.
- I had to.

1203
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:51,188
- Yeah?
- You would have been down there forever.

1204
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,316
Were you jerkin' off?

1205
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:54,951
Which do you wanna fuck first,
me or the knife?

1206
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:59,957
- You know how to use that?
- Honor student, remember?

1207
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:02,797
Nothing I can't do
when I put my mind to it.

1208
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:10,269
Toss the knife in the backyard!

1209
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:11,310
Why?

1210
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:13,539
Or you'll shoot again?
Go on, shoot me.

1211
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,115
You're not gonna shoot me!

1212
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:18,481
It's not me you have to worry about.
It's Janelle.

1213
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:21,147
I called her.

1214
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:25,624
Told her I was Lieutenant Hayley
from the L.A.P.D.

1215
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:27,523
How far does she live, Jeff?

1216
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:31,295
Look over there.

1217
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:33,995
Look over there!

1218
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:42,337
The deal's still open.

1219
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:46,209
You put the noose around your neck,
you end this whole game.

1220
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:50,841
I will still clean up all the evidence.
You're running out of time!

1221
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:53,917
Or we can wait for her.

1222
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,588
I'll pull off my clothes,

1223
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:01,992
and I will run into her arms.

1224
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:03,996
What? Unless I hang myself?

1225
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:09,759
I'll find you.
I'll track you down!

1226
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,770
Assuming you knew anything about me.

1227
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,898
Calabasas girl who's dad teaches
at UCW shouldn't be that hard to find.

1228
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:17,944
You believed all that, huh?

1229
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:23,382
Who are you?

1230
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:26,316
It's hard to say for sure.

1231
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:30,813
Maybe not a Calabasas girl.

1232
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:33,257
Maybe not the daughter
of a med school professor.

1233
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:37,160
- Maybe not even a friend of Donna Mauer.
- Maybe not even named Hayley.

1234
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,702
Who the hell are you?

1235
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:50,869
I am every little girl
you ever watched...

1236
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:54,679
touched, hurt,

1237
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:57,808
screwed, killed.

1238
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,461
- She's gonna find it, Jeff.
- No.

1239
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:22,531
She's gonna find it all. Put on the noose
and jump and I'll stop it.

1240
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:26,676
She'll never find out.

1241
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:30,342
She'll just think you were
some sad man

1242
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:32,009
who she never
should have left.

1243
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:35,889
Jeff?

1244
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:45,359
Bad things...

1245
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,730
Fucking awful things
will happen to you in prison.

1246
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:53,467
This is the only way. You'll wish you'd killed
yourself when you had the chance.

1247
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:56,442
It's the only way, Jeff.

1248
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:05,352
Jeff!

1249
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:24,965
I didn't kill her.

1250
01:37:28,776 --> 01:37:30,835
I just watched.

1251
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,571
I wanted to take pictures...

1252
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,512
but he wouldn't let me.

1253
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:41,111
It was me and another guy.

1254
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,381
I didn't do it.
I swear.

1255
01:37:44,491 --> 01:37:46,049
I'll tell you the name,

1256
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,628
and I'll help you find him.

1257
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:50,492
I'll help you find him.

1258
01:37:54,468 --> 01:37:56,060
I know his name.

1259
01:37:57,171 --> 01:38:00,072
I know his name, Jeff.

1260
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:05,509
You know what's funny?

1261
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,174
Jeff?

1262
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,585
Aaron told me you did it
before he killed himself.

1263
01:38:22,162 --> 01:38:24,187
It was him.
It wasn't me.

1264
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:26,566
Jeff.

1265
01:38:28,469 --> 01:38:31,370
I don't care.

1266
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:42,038
Jeff?

1267
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:33,695
Don't worry.

1268
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:36,861
I promise I'll take care of it all.

1269
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,361
Or not.
